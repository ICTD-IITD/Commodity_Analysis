While Mias wife Sakina died during labour as he was unable to carry her to the primary health centre due to flood, Sahs daughter Bimla breathed her last during child birth for want of proper medicare.Poor facilities and inadequate relief at the camp have only added to the miseries of marooned people. We have been provided only chura (flattened rice) and jaggery to eat in the last four days. There is no arrangement for pure drinking water, say the victims.I suffer from low blood pressure, but there is neither doctor nor the medicines I need in the camp, says Fatima of Belwa village.The foodstuff we are being provided is insufficient. We will return to our home as soon as the water recedes, says Kamali Devi, who has taken shelter in relief camp on Bhakhari high school premises in Patahi block.With the receding water leaving a trail of destruction, returning home is not going to be easy, say other victims at the Patahi relief camp. Most of the state highways and village roads have been washed away in the flash flood triggered by breach in the embankment on Lalbakya river, they add.Raju Baitha, one of the victims in the camp, says his house has been washed away and the government should provide compensation so that he can rebuild it. Many other flood victims demanded change in the menu.In some parts of district, incidents of snake bite have also created havoc among the affected people. Among the victims of snake bite is Ruchi Kumari, daughter of Suresh Sah of Persauna village.District magistrate Raman Kumar said apart from chura, the administration will provide rice and pulses to the affected people in relief camps. He said 13,000 people had taken shelter in 43 camps, where arrangements of food and medical facilities had been made."

Similarly, a major fraud by a contractor father-son duo came to fore after they were found to have submitted fake TDRs to grab several Government works in Kalahandi, Balangir, Nuapada and Bargarh districts.Man-animal conflicts were also reported from the region during the year. Panic spread in Nuapada after a leopard devoured a child. Subsequently, two leopards were trapped. Similarly, a man and his son were killed by a bear in Boudh.However, the silver lining was that Nuapada Collector Poma Tudu was adjudged among the best 10 Collectors in the country after she trekked four kms to reach out to remote villages in the backward district.Agriculture takes a back seatAgriculture, considered to be the mainstay of western Odisha, took a beating in 2017.

Although coal output in the MCL's mines suffered setbacks due to agitations by displaced people, those managed to maintain the targeted production. However, there was a good news that the development of airport in Jharsuguda was started by AAI with commercial flights slated to fly out next year.Red terrorExcept killing of two Maoists in an encounter with the security forces at Salepali under Paikmal police limits in Bargarh district and recovery of two .303 rifles, there was no major offensive involving the Red rebels. However, the Maoists made their presence felt with occasional display of banners and pasting of posters which kept the security forces on their toes.All eyes on Bijepur bypollThe panchayat poll left BJD to rethink of its strategy with the BJP springing surprises in the elections. All eyes are now on by-election of Bijepur Assembly segment after three-time sitting Congress MLA Subal Sahu died on August 22.

Farmers have to sleep in the open in the cold climate as officials of procurement agencies failed to turn up.Alleging nexus between Supplies Department officials and rice millers, Mohanty said some farmers are complaining that they are asked by mandi officials to sell their stock to millers if they want to get back home early. The millers will keep their cut of about 15 kg per quintal of paddy and pay less than the minimum support price announced by the Government.In the first phase, we are planning to gherao some mandis in Dharamgarh block of Kalahandi district where such discrepancies have been reported. We will organise such protests in other areas where farmers are facing similar problems. If their problems are not sorted out, our target will be the offices of civil supplies officers of district concerned, Mohanty said.Mandis have not been opened by several Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACSs) as they do not have requisite infrastructure for grading, weighing machine and people to help loading and unloading.Delay in paddy procurement in some parts of Balasore and Keonjhar districts have been resented by the farmers, he added."

That it has turned into a public health emergency in the capital, with the air quality index touching extremely hazardous levels in some parts, necessitating the closure of primary schools, has further lowered its standing. It is unconscionable for governments, through indifference and inaction, to subject citizens to such toxic air, and cause extreme suffering especially among people with respiratory ailments and impaired lung function. The smog that envelops the region is exacerbated by the burning of biomass in Punjab and Haryana, and the winter atmosphere is marked by weak ventilation. An analysis of local sources by IIT-Kanpur last year pointed to construction dust, vehicular pollution, and domestic and industrial emissions as other major factors. Clearly, the burden of such chronic problems has outweighed the benefits conferred by measures such as the ban on Deepavali crackers, and in the past, the shift to compressed natural gas for commercial vehicles and restricting car use to odd and even number plates on alternate days. A comprehensive solution demands that the governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, assisted by the Centre, address farm residue burning and construction dust.The post-monsoon  as opposed to pre-monsoon  burning of rice and wheat residue releases maximum aerosols that contribute to the volume of PM2.5, which gets embedded in the lungs. Automation of farm operations leaves root-bound crop waste after machine harvesting, running to millions of tonnes, requiring a solution of scale. Sustainable residue removal cannot be achieved by the farmers alone, and requires help from the state machinery. Here, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should be commended for his initiative to discuss the modalities of joint action with the Punjab and Haryana governments. The national capital needs a major greening effort. Unpaved surfaces raise dust levels as in all Indian cities, but civic agencies ignore the problem. There is every reason to think that even the Ministry of Environments orders issued in 2015 under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to comprehensively green Delhis road margins and open spaces were not pursued seriously. Shifting more of the citys travel to comfortable public transport can cut fine particulates in congested areas and improve the air for residents. Many such initiatives were taken up by China in its cities to reduce exposure to PM2.5 that produces morbidity from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and leads to premature death. Only a determined response to the crisis can spare Delhi of its infamous tag as one of the most polluted cities on the planet."

For them, life is virtually a curse and daily fight for survival in the inaccessible Baghbindha as the village lacks basic amenities including road, drinking water, health and education services. It also belies tall claims of development of the BJD Government, while Union Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram too has failed to mitigate the suffering of the people of his constituency.Sources said the small village, with nearly 110 headcounts, lies neglected. While administrative officials and politicians never visit the village, the local health workers inevitably carry out national campaigns, including vaccination drives. The village is located on the lap of a hill with three to four houses on the hilltop, while the rest 16 to 17 mud houses are located on the lower slopes of the other end at a distance of about two km. Pankadihi panchayat headquarters via Joda is about 11 km away from Baghbindha village.The six-km stretch from Joda to Baghbindha is a nightmare for travellers and it could be covered only by walking. It takes at least four hours through the shortest forest and steep hilly route and about seven hours through another less difficult forest route to reach the village.Village women said for collecting BPL rice, they go to Joda early in the morning and return home by evening carrying rice bags on heads. A natural water stream, about three km away, is the only source of drinking water which goes dry during summer mounting the woes of the villagers. During rainy season, the village remains cut off.Baghbindha primary school, opened in 2010, was closed after three years. There is no anganwadi centre as 16 kids, aged between two and five years, cannot travel to Joda through forest which is a risky affair.Some children were seen roaming leisurely or doing household chores. One girl said she studies in a residential tribal school elsewhere. One Nauri Kindo has quit the job of Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) voluntarily after failing to travel with patients. During health emergency, patients are carried on cots to Joda to avail ambulance service.A village youth Ambrus Jojo, who works in Delhi, said despite harsh life, the rest of his family members prefer to stay in the village as they are emotionally attached to the place.Gurundia BDO Methedius Lakra said earth road work has started in the village under MGNREGS and proposals would be made for anganwadi centre, solar lighting and drinking water facilities."

What would you attribute this to? Is it Naveen Patnaiks personal charisma or lack of leaders matching your stature in the Opposition political parties of the State?A: It is only about our commitment to the development and welfare of the State. My Government is a peoples Government; people are at the centre of all our initiatives. Our success purely goes to the love and support shown by the people of my State.Q: How has your 17 years of rule helped develop Odisha?A: As you know Odisha was going through despair at the start of this millennium. We have brought in some fundamental changes in administration and have made governance accountable to the peoples interest. And now you see, Odisha is doing fine on many fronts including economy, social sector and welfare measures. From a rice deficit State, we are now a rice surplus State, being third highest contributor to Public Distribution System.

I believe, now this sector is getting back its momentum.Q: Your Government has shown a sudden burst of energy in the last one year, making an all out attempt to connect with the people, specially the young generation.

Aartis and Ayyappa invocations are performed in the pre-dawn and post-dusk hours at the temples. They have heralded the Sabarimala pilgrimage season by conducting special rites of different nature.18 timesPilgrim groups have entered the mandatory vrata invariably under Guruswamis or leaders. A devotee has to visit Sabarimala at least 18 times to become a Guruswami.Guruswamis help the pilgrims of their groups perform the rites faultlessly, said Baiju Harisree, a young Guruswami at Podiyattupara Mahadeva temple at Melmuri near here. The Shiva temple on top of a giant rock made to stand alone by incessant granite quarrying has become a local tourist attraction.Mr. Baiju and his followers take a dip in the deep pool down the rock and climb the 74 steps made of iron bars to reach the temple twice every day. Its hard. But when it comes to performing the rites with dedication, it becomes easy, he said.The devotees wake up around 4 a.m. daring the pre-dawn chilly weather and perform aarti or puja and invoke Lord Ayyappa over 100 times. Ideally its 108 times, said Madhavan Menon, another Guruswami.Although the degree of austerity maintained during the vrata period varies among the devotees, principles of brahmacharya are generally maintained by most. Rice meal is eaten only once a day. Most pilgrims visit important temples across the State during the Sabarimala pilgrimage. Pilgrims from Malabar usually never miss the temples at Kadampuzha, Guruvayur, Kodungallur, Thriprayar, Aluva manapuram, Tiruvanchikulam, Ettumanur, Kadappattur, Vaikom, Chottanikkara, Ambalapuzha, Mannarsala, Aranmula, and Chakkulathukavu.The Mandala vrata is meant not only to cleanse the soul and body, but also to prepare for presenting ourselves before Lord Ayyappa, said Mr. Baiju.Mr. Baiju is leading a fairly large group of devotees from here this time.

Hills and Chamarajnagar.Now, the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore (UAS-B) is working towards popularising Rajgira and some other crop varieties in Karnataka.Dr. Niranjan Murthy, Professor and HOD, Potential Crops, UAS-B, has developed a new robust variety of Rajgira (KBGA-4), which was unveiled at Krishi Mela  2017 on Thursday.The variety I have developed gives 20% more yield than the existing varieties and is resistant to Phillody and Leaf Rust disease, he said. Rajgira has one of the highest protein content among all cereals. While rice has 7% and wheat 9% protein, Rajgira has 16%. Also, it has a high content of Lysine, an essential amino acid, usually deficit in most cereals.However, the high protein content means that it can only be used after it has been processed.For instance, 15-20% of Rajgira flour can be added to wheat or multi-grain atta to make chapatis. Or, like the Soligas do, the grains can be popped and later made into unde (laddus with popped grain and jaggery) or as chikki, the scientist said.But how profitable is growing Rajgira for farmers? The crop can also be used for its leaves (Dantu soppu), ensuring that the entire plant is monetised. A kilo of Rajgira in the retail market is around Rs. 125, which may stabilise further if farmers start growing the crop in the State, Dr. Murthy said.Rajgira has a market in Europe as well. Rajgira oil has 7% Sqaulene, a compound that is widely used in cosmetics for its anti-ageing properties.The Department of Potential Crops, is now working on two other millets considered super foods worldwide: quinoa and chia seeds.Both thrive in temperate climate, can be grown during the Rabi season in hilly areas and even in Bengaluru, scientists have now found out. Scientists have grown both crops in the UAS-B campus and are experimenting with different varieties.A group of farmers in Mysuru are already growing chia seeds and exporting them, they pointed out."

Mr. Gates, who was earlier received at the Visakhapatnam International Airport by Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his Cabinet colleagues, said Andhra Pradesh was already a major seed producer for India and South Asia, and was well positioned to become a hub in this field. It can leverage local expertise in GIS and its world-class IT sector along with low-cost commercial software and DNA testing services to develop better varieties more quickly, he opined.He said: Imagine what could happen if every farmer of A.P. was growing the latest varieties bred for todays environment and production system. A data feedback loop could help A.P. bridge the gap between innovation happening in its public breeding programmes and the products farmers need to boost productivity.Livestock diseasesStating that nearly half of all households in A.P. rear livestock, everyone should think about productivity from that perspective.Diseases can wipe out flocks and herds, driving smallholders even further into poverty. For example, Newcastle disease can kill three-quarters of chickens in a flock during an outbreak. Through a partnership with Hester Biosciences, there is now a vaccine that costs just three cents a dose. He admitted that India was also pioneering vaccines and medicines for other costly livestock diseases that spread to humans such as porcine cysticercosis.This disease is endemic to Indias swineherds and is the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy in developing countries. It also kills 50,000 people a year, he informed.Milk productionReferring to the dairy sector, he said India was the worlds largest milk producer, but this success was owed to a very large number of animals producing fairly small amounts of milk. In A.P., many of the indigenous cattle breeds owned by smallholder farmers produce only a fraction of the milk thats possible. But crossbred cows could yield more than double the milk than the typical indigenous breed. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, he said, was supporting the National Dairy Plan to increase milk production across India by six million tonne annually."

Marginal farmers in Sundargarh opted for selling their crops at local markets or to middlemen, even before the purchase at mandis started on December 15.After a farmer manages to overcome the vagaries of nature and is finally blessed with good harvest, his real test of patience begins at the time of procurement. Farmers claimed they usually go through a long process to get the MSP for paddy, fixed at Rs 1,550 per quintal for common grade and Rs 1,590 for grade A. Fearing delay, marginal and small farmers started selling paddy crop for Rs 950 to Rs 1,200 per quintal at the village weekly market and to rural traders, middle men and agents of rice mills, sources said.Farmers save themselves from the long procedure and extra transportation cost as middlemen or agents buy paddy stocks from their doorsteps, offering ready cash.In a vast district like Sundargarh comprising 279 gram panchayats, there are only 116 Paddy Procurement Centres (PPCs). Some centres are even 40 km away from villages, farmers said.It is better to sell paddy privately to avoid the transportation cost, a marginal farmer, Joseph Xess, said.According to the approximate estimates of the Agriculture department, out of 2.19 lakh farmers, only 33,000 have registered online.The ordeal of the farmers starts with online registration at 44 LAMPSs (Large Area Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies) and handful of agriculture centres. The farmers often fear having to return empty-handed, if there is no staff or internet disruption at the centre, sources said.Not just that, the quantity of paddy that could be sold by a farmer involves a complex calculation by Revenue Inspectors and Civil Supplies Officer concerned. Before sale of paddy, farmers have to travel long distances to procure tokens in advance from PPCs and each PPC issues 15-20 tokens a day, sources added. All these complexities had apparently compelled farmers to avoid the procurement process. Another difficulty for the farmers lies in the fact that each PPC buys paddy two to three days a week from 7 am to 1 pm. Moreover, farmers can sell their paddy only on prescribed dates.During delivery of crop, agents of rice mills at the PPCs deduct 5-10 per cent citing lack of Fair Average Quality. Moreover, at the PPCs, farmers are forced to offer labour although the rice millers get Rs 9 per quintal as Mandi Labour charges, sources said.Bonai Krushak Sangh president Dambrudhar Kishan claimed about 60 per cent owners of agricultural lands availed online registration. But, the share-croppers who cultivate their lands manage to get the MSP by selling paddy stocks to unscrupulous middlemen, earning `100 per quintal as commission, he said."

But the practice yields good benefits in the long run, observes Chinta Divya Sundara Rama Reddy, who has been cultivating paddy by adopting the ZBNF method for the last three consecutive crop seasons.A native of Arthamuru village of Mandapeta mandal in East Godavari district, Mr. Reddy is one among the few farmers who switched to the reinvented method of ancient farm practice.No synthetic fertilizersThere is a big no to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Instead, we are using animal dung as fertilizer and cow urine and neem decoction as pesticide, says the 49-year-old farmer, who owns three acres of land and runs a photo studio in the village.Before adopting ZBNF, Mr. Reddy used to spend Rs. 25,000 per acre on farm expenses per season, of which about Rs. 10,000 was for fertilizers and pesticides.The output used to be about 42 bags per acre. Now, I am able to save Rs. 10,000, but the yield has come down by 10 bags to 32 bags per acre, he explains.Mr. Reddy, however, is seeing the brighter side of the farm practice in the form of steady increase in yield and better pricing for the produce.At present, 12,250 farmers from 32 mandals are in the ambit of ZBNF. They are cultivating various crops, including paddy, cotton, and orchards, in an extent of about 12,000 acres across the district. In all, ZBNF is adopted in 36 clusters and the idea is to encourage more and more farmers to switch to natural farming, says K. Parthasarathi, district project manager of ZBNF.On their part, the officials are encouraging the farmers by way of offering subsidies on construction of cattle sheds and making of natural fertilizer and pesticides.We are encouraging the farmers to mix agriculture with aqua and horticultures by way of digging a small pond in the farm and cultivating vegetables, fruits, and flowers on the bunds, he explains.MarketingMarketing the produce is a major challenge. As I can afford the delay in marketing, I am selling the organic rice in a phased manner. Once the channels of marketing the produce are opened, more and more farmers will take up ZBNF in the near future, says Mr. Reddy, who observes an increase in soil health and improvement in the quality of grain in the current crop season."

Ramachandran coinciding with the late Chief Ministers birth centenary celebrations in Thanjavur. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami is all set to release the rice variety for popular use at the granary of Tamil Nadu on Wednesday.MGR 100 is the rechristened nomenclature of CO 52, which, in fact, is a derivative of the cross involving BPT 5204 and CO (R) 50. The new variety was developed through marker-assisted pedigree breeding, combining quality, yield and blast resistance features of the two popular varieties.Maturing in 130 to 135 days, MGR 100 is medium- tall in stature and displays efficient tillering capacity and long droopy panicles with highly acceptable plant characters.TNAU scientists hope this variety could be a good replacement for BPT 5204 due to its high yield, superior grain quality and pest and disease resistance.The variety recorded a mean grain yield of 6,879 kg per hectare over three years of station trials with 16.10% and 20.93 % improvement over CO (R) 49 and BPT 5204, respectively.In multi-location trials conducted over the last six years, the variety registered steady increase in yield. Adaptive research trials for the CO 52 rice variety were conducted at 158 locations during 2013-14 and 2014-15 in 21 districts during which yields crossed 7,000 kg/ha in 24 locations, says V. Ravi, Director-in-charge, Aduthurai Rice Research Institute.During the annual rice meet, the variety was recommended for large-scale demonstration based on its consistent high yield performances over the years.Following that, the on farm trials (OFT) were conducted with CO 52 during 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 in 36 locations across Tamil Nadu on one-acre plots. Overall, the CO 52 rice variety recorded a mean productivity of 6,191 kg/ha in six years of trials with 11.29% increase over the existing BPT 5204 and 8.14 % over ADT 49.Wait for notificationAt Therku Kadayam village in Tirunelveli district, the variety recorded the highest yield of 10,416 kg/ha among the trials conducted, demonstrating the highest yield potential of this variety, according to K. Ganesamurthy, Director-in-charge, Centre for Plant Breeding and Genetics, TNAU.Though the CO 52 is being released as MGR 100, the TNAU is awaiting the gazetting of the variety by the Central Seed Sub Committee for Variety Release and Notification, which is expected shortly.Releasing the new variety is welcome but we need to popularise it. The new rice variety will be acceptable to the farmers only if it delivers the promised yield. The release of new paddy varieties needs to be seen against the backdrop of the farmers current preference and penchant for traditional rice varieties for their innate strength, said M.J. Prabhu, Programme Coordinator, Green Cause Foundation, Morappakkam, Kancheepuram district.Earlier too, the TNAU had released rice varieties named after Chief Ministers. In 1970, it brought out Karuna (CO 33) by crossing IR 8 and ADT 27 which was a short duration paddy variety, while in 1993 it had come out with JJ 92 (ADT 41) that is a white aromatic rice and a mutant of Basmati.In fact, way back in 1994, the TNAU had released MGR (COR H1), which is the first hybrid rice in India. The new MGR 100 follows that variety from the TNAU lab."

The remaining varieties are scarce but their utilitarian value has been well harnessed by the tribal communities in central and eastern parts of India, where they are used to stock dry food besides storing liquor, water and herbal medicine. Besides, people also draw and paint on these gourds, and this practice has evolved into a form of art unique to these tribal communities, Mr. Krishnaprasad said.The concept was inspired by the traditions among the tribal communities in central and eastern India, like in Chhattisgarh where the wild gourd  which is not edible  not only has utilitarian and functional value but is also used depict artwork, he said.The outer hard shell lends itself to be the medium for fine art. Besides, they can be used as musical instruments as well. We thought of exploiting this concept and promote gourd art so as to create a market for it and help revive the rare varieties, said Ms. Seema, who has created a few articles out of gourds such as lampshades, boxes, plates and cups.How it is doneExplaining the method, the couple said the fruit is left in the plant to dry and harden. There is a little bit of processing involved by removing the skin. After this, the shell is carved and synthetic colour is applied. We are experimenting with natural dyes as well.The couple want to scale things up by teaching the concept to womens self-help groups for mass production. This has potential for income generation, but an indirect fallout will be a greater demand for rare varieties of gourd thanks to the new market for gourd art work. This will result in their conservation, said Mr. Krishnaprasad.In Mysuru region, wild gourd varieties are found in Kollegal, H.D. Kote, Hunsur and Periyapatana. A number of farmers groups have been identified to work on this. Besides, three womens SHGs have been co-opted for training. While gourd ordinarily may fetch about Rs. 20 a kg, a little bit of value addition will help generate additional income for the SHGs, Mr. Krishnaprasad said.An artist from Nagpur specialising in gourd carving and painting has been identified for training the SHGs. The project is expected to gather steam from January."

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday promised completion of irrigation projects in the State if voted to power and to ensure credibility in governance.Addressing a public meeting on the 20th day of his Praja Sankalpa Yatra at Gonegandla in Kurnool district, Mr. Jagan charged Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu with not sanctioning funds for the Pulikanuma project, which hardly required Rs. 20 crore for completion, as 90 % of works on it were completed during his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddys rule. The area became parched as it was not getting water from the Tungabhadra dam in Karnataka, but the government was nonchalant, he said.Mr. Naidu promised release of three tmcft of water from Handri Neeva to the Gajuladinne reservoir three months ago but it remained on paper, he said. The YSR Congress president promised total loan waiver of DWCRA members in four phases. He promised construction of 25 lakh houses for the poor.The Chief Minister owed Rs. 90,000 to each unemployed person in the State as he promised a monthly stipend of Rs. 2,000 if his government could not provide jobs, the Opposition leader asserted. Mr. Jagan said only rice was being supplied under the public distribution system, but the poor were deprived of subsidised rice on the pretext that their fingerprints were not recorded. Mr. Naidu promised cut in power charges, but an ordinary family had to pay power bills ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000, he said.Handloom weavers got a subsidy of Rs. 600 in the past, and Mr. Naidu promised to enhance it to Rs. 1,000, but did nothing except pose for photographs with the weavers and publicise it, the Opposition leader alleged. The promise to build sheds for handloom weavers with Rs. 1.50 lakh and to disburse loans up to Rs. 1 lakh at low interest was not kept. He assured differently-abled persons of Gonegandla to consider their request for increase in pension from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 5,000 and construct double bedroom houses for them on formation of the YSRCP government. Mr. Jagan began his padayatra at Puttapasam in Gonegandla mandal of Yemmiganur constituency and covered H. Kairavadi, Gajuladinne crossroads and made a night halt at Gonegandla."

He left his job in an insurance firm after he met Nammalwar Iyah, added Ms. Menaka.People like Deepa, who is from a family of farmers in Arani, said she took part in the event after her brother, who is into organic farming, told her about it.It is nice to see so many people cook pongal at a place, she said despite sitting in the smoke from the burning of firewood.Her neighbour C.A. Payal, a transperson, who runs a catering unit in Choolaimedu, said if she had a bit more of jaggery and if she had been able to roast the cashews and raisins in ghee, her preparation using sigappu kaar rice would have tasted better. I make biryani for weddings along with friends. Having learnt it from my aachi at home, I cook 100kg-200kg quite easily, she said.The event was organised with the help of volunteers including Malathi.

S. Lister and A. Inian, the senior investigation officers, visited the rented house of the family in Vettukaliamman Koil Street in Anna Nagar.The murder took place last Saturday when the accused Irulandi, who was also a tenant in the same building, picked up a quarrel with Kachammal, a conservancy worker in a private hospital, and her husband K. Pandi (65). Irulandi reportedly attacked them with an iron hook used to lift gunny bags and a log. The couple were admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital where Kachammal died the following day.K.

Diabetes was multi-factorial disease and could not be attributed merely to the consumption of rice.In fact, research showed that the two varieties of rice popular in the State  Swarna and Masuri  had lower glycemic Index (GI) when compared to Basmati popular in North India.Quoting a study conducted by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), it said the GI (measure of a food items ability to increase the blood sugar levels after eating) of Swarna and Masuri rice varieties was below 55 compared to Basmatis more than 60.Dr. Radhakrishna said the IRRI study compared the GI of 233 varieties of rice. The GI of Basmati ranged between 68 and 74 and all other Indian varieties it was below 60.

Visitors are greeted by the sight of men and women working in sun-baked fields growing rice and vegetables, youngsters flaunting their new motorbikes, and the elderly engaged in more sedentary pursuits.The dusty road by the church leads to the home of Kareddulla Nageswara Rao. Its a simple house, with a verandah, living room and kitchen. Raos agility belies his 70 years. Like most members of his community, he was once a convict. Now he spends his time translating the Bible into his native Yerukula language.The turn to crime and backNageswara Rao grew up in a broken family. After his father married a second time, his family attachments loosened further. He married his uncles daughter and began to work in the fields but the income was meagre.It was in the early 70s that we started breaking into houses, recalls Rao. Over the next 15 years, crime became a part of life. I was charged with offences in Kalahasti, Hyderabad, Tirupathi and Visakhapatnam.Rao belongs to a generation of Yerukulas forced to take to crime to support their families. Farm work was available only for a few months. Lack of irrigation facilities meant that farming was largely dependent on the rains, which were infrequent, while the wells that supplied water to the crops often went dry.But even after abandoning their old ways, Rao and others like him continued to bear the stigma. Despised by society and hounded by the police, they lived in constant fear of harassment and worse. I gave up crime way back in 1984, after serving two jail terms. But the police would come to our home to probe crimes committed elsewhere. The needle of suspicion was always on us. Some burglary may have happened in Visakhapatnam or Rajahmundry (nearly 500 km and 300 km away), but we were always the first ones to be rounded up and questioned, says Rao.While serving a jail sentence along with him, Raos wife gave birth to a daughter in 1984. We named her Gnana Jyothi, Rao says. I remember we had a baby shower function in the jail premises, where most guests were prison officials. Thats when I decided to change. Today my daughter works as a teacher. She supports us.In the pastThe Yerukulas were originally traders of grain and salt who used to operate across the Madras Presidency. The men loaded their goods on donkeys and bullocks, and travelled with their families, supplying essential goods from the coast to far-flung areas in the interior.When the British introduced road and railway transport in the 1850s, wagons replaced the donkeys, and the traders lost their traditional means of livelihood. These tribesmen were not only traders but also dealt in forest and agricultural produce.But enclosures instituted by the British cut them off from common forest land and pastures. They used to make baskets, mats, brooms and brushes, but could no longer source the raw material. They were also acrobats, dancers, singers, and fortune-tellers, but the big crowds they attracted in public places made the colonial administration nervous.The old antagonism and suspicion that landed communities have always harboured for itinerant gypsies combined with colonial prejudice to criminalise an entire community that had lived for centuries on the margins, playing a crucial role as a distribution chain for remote settlements. For the Yerukulas, it led to their being declared as a criminal tribe.The book, Criminocurology; or The Indian Criminal, and What to do With Him: Being a Review of the Work of The Salvation Army Among the Prisoners, Habituals and Criminal Tribes of India , which was authored by Commissioner Frederick Booth Tucker of the Salvation Army and published in 1916, was instrumental in giving currency and respectability to the notion that the Yerukulas were criminals  a reputation that continues to haunt them well into the 21st century.The Salvation Army, a Protestant Christian charitable organisation, was an influential handmaiden of the empire, and the British looked to their expertise in reforming these itinerant nomadic tribes by settling them in one place.Booth Tuckers book offers a glimpse into the intellectual discourse on crime around the time the Yerukulas became an Indian criminal tribe. He classified Indias criminal tribesmen into categories such as the incorrigible, the hereditary, the habitual, the ordinary, and so on: The hereditary criminal represents a state of crime practically unknown elsewhere. It might be called a state of war rather than a state of crime. On one side are ranged the police officers of Indian empire backed by the Army, and on the other side a compact phalanx of trained warriors, including men, women and children and often marshalled and led by women chieftains. They meet power with cunning and force with fraud. The hereditary child criminal is the saddest aspect in the state of crime.Rise of reformatory settlementsIn the early 20th century, the British began setting up small experimental colonies in the coastal areas of the Madras Presidency, where suspects were detained. But despite these experiments, the crime rate did not abate.Feeling weighed down by the burden of restraining the criminal tribes in South India, around 1913, Harold Stuart, the then Home Member of the Madras Government, approached the Salvation Army to help settle these wandering tribesmen in industrial and agricultural colonies, and wean them away from crime. And thus was born Stuartpuram, named after Stuart.It became a model colony of sorts where the British government and the Salvation Army pursued their experiments in criminocurology, or curing a criminal people of their criminal tendencies.In an essay titled Colonial Construction of a Criminal Tribe: Yerukulas of Madras Presidency, sociologist and post-colonial researcher Meena Radhakrishna has documented the colonial prejudices and administrative anxieties that resulted in an itinerant people getting branded as a criminal tribe. These prejudices and anxieties were further buttressed by the interests of the Indian landlord community and upper castes, who not only shared similar misconceptions, but saw in the criminalised Yerukulas a cheap and captive source of farm labour.The colonial government and the landed elite together wove a persuasive narrative that culminated in the Criminal Tribes Act, 1911, which empowered the administration to set up colonies where the so-called criminal tribes would be reformed.The first settlement in Madras Presidency was opened at the Old Railway Colony in Seethanagaram, near Vijayawada, in 1913. Charles Mackenzie, an American missionary who later took the Indian name of Anandham, was appointed Superintendent and given the liberty to visit jails, talk with the men, and select the first settlers for the colony.The second settlement was established in the same year in Stuartpuram, which was originally called Bethapudi. Around 2,000 acres of land, including 1,500 acres of swamp, was put at the disposal of the Salvation Army by the British government.The development of the colony was not easy. Men and women were trained in farming, draining the land, plantation of gardens, and construction of buildings. Two schools were established. Around 6,000 Yerukulas began to live there, and over time, the settlement grew, sustained by the women and men turning into wage workers at the Indian Leaf Tobacco Company (ILTD), which had been operating in Guntur since 1908.No more a wandering peopleInterestingly, Radhakrishna points out that the official sources of the British administration acknowledge the lack of any real basis for branding the [Yerukula] community a criminal one. She notes that in the annual crime figures of Madras Presidency, their proportion in the criminal population was always lower than their proportion in the total population.The net outcome of these colonial measures was a forced transformation of the Yerukula way of life  from an itinerant community with an independent life and a rich oral tradition, to a settled one dependant on wage labour, and with no knowledge of their past history other than the one thrust upon them by the British and the Salvation Army.I believe that most of the community members who were forcibly settled in Stuartpuram were never criminals in the first place. So the reformation part somehow does not apply. These people were not criminals when they were declared to be legally so by the British government. They were victims of intense prejudice because they had a nomadic or gypsy lifestyle which was considered to be criminal. There were significant cultural differences between the way these people lived and the moral code shared by the British, the Salvation Army and the surrounding mainstream villagers, says Radhakrishna.In course of time, it was found that even the reformed men in Stuartpuram were returning to their original ways. A kind of cumulative community mentality set in among the people who were housed in the same colony for several years. While the intention of the missionaries can never be questioned, we felt that the people were never really empowered, as they were not given any rights over the land they tilled, says Sundar Kompalli, Director of Nastika Kendram.Today, the Yerukulas own self-perception is dominated by the narrative drilled into them by the missionaries and merciless colonial police. Their nomadic past as salt and grain traders is all but wiped out from their collective memory. Their recently acquired identity as a people with an ancestry of crime who outwitted the police and struck fear in the hearts of the common man is strangely comforting, if not empowering, in a present where discrimination and marginality persists. It is this borrowed myth of criminal daredevilry that present-day descendants of the Yerukulas believe in and live by.In a survey held in the year 1973, there were 250 Yerukulas with criminal cases against them. Tiger Nageswara Rao was one of them. He had earned notoriety for his ability to evade the police, even in custody. He got the moniker of Tiger after managing to escape from a Chennai jail. Tiger was eventually shot dead by the police in 1987. A portrait of him hangs at the main door of his house in Stuartpuram.Tigers brother, Garika Prabhakara Rao, masterminded a bank robbery at Banaganapalle mandal in Kurnool district in 1974. It was the biggest bank heist of time, with the loot being Rs. 35 lakh.Now stricken with paralysis, Prabhakara Rao sits in his modest two-room house, reflecting on his past exploits. Everything changed after the Banaganapalle bank robbery case, he says. We were a ten-member gang. We broke the locks of a back door around midnight, despite the fact that a police station faced the bank on the front. We broke the safe, carried it to a graveyard, and helped ourselves to 14 kg of gold and Rs. 50,000 in cash. Before we could share the loot amongst us, policemen surrounded our village. We decided to surrender through Lavanam.Lavanam is the son of Gora, who in the 1970s founded the Vijayawada-based Nastika Kendram. Along with his wife Hemalatha, he worked in the colony to reform the people through an approach he called Samskar, which differed from the ways of the Salvation Army. Facilitating the surrender of Prabhakara Rao before the Guntur Superintendent of Police was one of Lavanams first achievements. What followed was an affirmative social action programme that sought active intervention from the state.Turning the cornerThe Andhra Pradesh government in 1976 issued orders declaring that Stuartpuram was no longer a reformatory for criminals but a free colony. It was merged with Bethapudi village. Land ownership rights were provided to the inhabitants. When Jalagam Vengala Rao was Chief Minister, the people were given pattas in 150 acres under Romperu Drain. Successive Collectors, including P.S. Krishnan, Ratan P. Watal (who is now NITI Aayogs principal adviser), S.R. Sankaran and many others showed special interest in the development of the colony. After these interventions, in the baseline survey conducted by Nastik Kendra in 2002, the number of men in police records came down to just 12. Men and women began to seek higher education.Devara Subba Rao, former chairperson of the Tribal Cooperative Finance Corporation, says that he was the first in his family to get into Group-1 services, and as an executive director of Scheduled Tribes Corporation, took up several developmental works in the colony.Devara Vasu, joint secretary, AP Tribal Welfare Residential Educational Society, and Ch. Koteswara Rao, a retired Director General of Police (DGP), are among the other civil servants from the village. It is only through social reformation by missionaries that I was able to come up in life. I now live in a beautiful house in Banjara Hills, next to the residence of a movie star. I never thought I would come so far, says Subba Rao.But as the years rolled by, state interventions began to dwindle. Now, few government officers visit the village. The A.P. government undertakes development work through the Tribal Welfare Department. But the departments total outlay for Guntur district for 2016 was just Rs. 25.30 lakh. Only two schemes of financial support were sanctioned for Bapatla mandal. A Tribal Welfare Residential School still operates, with a strength of 60 students. The reluctance of bankers to lend to anyone in Stuartpuram is another stumbling block in the development of the community, pointing to the disturbing persistence of an old prejudice.The next generationA recent accomplishment that has brought joy to the people of Stuartpuram came from the world of sport. Ragala Venkat Rahul and Varun, aged 20 and 19, won gold at the recent Australian Weightlifting Championship. Representing the new hopes of a new generation, the champions from Stuartpuram are determined to make it big in life.I used to train Rahul from the age of one, by making him to lift small weights, says his father Madhu. When he passed class three in the village school, I enrolled him at Hakimpet Sports School near Hyderabad. Since then, my sons have been winning medals in various championships. Madhu now dreams of nurturing his sons into world champions.To make this dream come true, he will need all the help he can get. The A.P. government had announced cash award of Rs. 15 lakh and Rs. 10 lakh to Rahul and Varun and promised to grant them some land too. But there has been no action from the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh.Social activist Lavanam says that a study in 2014 revealed that no major crime involving the Yerukula tribe had been registered during the last 40 years. He urged the police not to link any organised crime to Stuartpuram. That is a message that not just the police but society at large would do well to heed."

The beverage came from different regions of the island nation as part of cultural diplomacy and business initiative.Guests were treated to an assortment of sake, which was kept in long wine glasses so that the discerning could get a feel of each drink . The rice wine, with alcohol kept extremely low, is ideal for connoisseurs who have acquired taste for the drink.Enlightening guests about the need for promoting sake, Miho Komatsu, a Japanese sake expert, claimed, Sake symbolises the peace loving culture of Japan. If consumed in optimal quantity, it generates energy, hydrates skin and keeps cardiovascular diseases at bay.In taste, Junmai Ginjo sake was a pleasant drink which had flavours of fresh pear and jasmine. It has short grain rice named Yamadanishiki. Each sake is special as it has varied proportion of rice and alcohol. Since the rice content is more than alcohol the taste has sweetness to it.Explaining the methodology , Miho Komatsu, representative of Akashi Tai, said: Brewing superior sake by hand requires all five senses to be perfect with the natural process of fermentation and flavour development. Even the hushed process of natural fermentation at work can be heard in the cool quiet rooms of our brewery.The event demonstrated that sake can be paired with not only the Japanese cuisine but also goes well with South Indian snacks like idlis and spicy samosas. According to Rie Yoshitake, sake specialist, sakes versatility can be seen from the fact that it helps in enhancing flavours of food.During my Delhi trip, I discovered that it goes well spicy with Indian dishes. We are introducing it to develop relationship between the two nations.Sake is prepared by rice grown in different regions of Japan. But rice is transported everywhere. In North Japan, sake is drier as people in the region eat less spicy food. In South, it becomes sweeter as the locals eat spicy food, informs Rie Yoshitake.On how sake varies from wine in terms of preparation, she said: Wine is made from grapes which is in the land of producer but rice is transported to all parts of Japan. We dont have regionalism but sake makers infuse their own personality in the drink. While wine is in the hands of weather, sakes quality is in the hands of its maker. It is important to understand that sake makers have their own peculiar characteristics and skills. Bad rice can be compensated by skill of the sake maker.She said that one couldnt trace its exact origin but but its was prepared even 2,000 years ago. Japanese are basically rice eaters. One fine day rice was accidentally left on the ground with water. So when that rice was eaten it became sweeter because of the enzyme.Rice used in sake does not contain the kind of enzymes that barley does. So a different ingredient is needed to help convert the starch into sugar. This ingredient is koji (yeast). When koji is combined with rice then enzymes are produced which break up the starch in the rice and turn it into sugar.Summing up, she said: Sake is consumed on special occasions. Most importantly, it is meant to connect people no matter which region, country or continent they come from  heart-to-heart.While wine is in the hands of weather, sakes quality is in the hands of its makerRie Yoshitake"

Panneerselvam, accompanied by Ministers P. Thangamani (Electricity), R.B. Udhaya Kumar (Revenue) and D. Jayakumar (Fisheries), on Sunday undertook inspection of Cyclone Ockhi-hit Kanniyakumari district and said the trail of destruction was minimal due to adequate precautionary measures taken by the State Government.Mr. Panneerselvam said power supply would be restored completely by Monday. The cyclone caused damages to 3,600 electricity poles. It was only to ensure public safety and prevent major destruction, power supply was suspended earlier. The State government had allotted Rs. 25 crore in the first phase for relief works.He inspected the cyclone-affected areas such as Therisanankoppu, Thomayarpuram, Thadikarakonam and Esanthimangalam. The fishermen were advised not to venture into sea three days ahead of the cyclone, and precautionary measures were taken adequately by officials of various departments.Many rubber plantations and banana fields suffered damage in these localities. During the inspection, he interacted with some farmers at Eesanthimangalam, the Deputy Chief Minister added.Mr. Thangamani said as the district had narrow by-lanes, accessibility remained a hurdle. Power supply had been restored in 50% of Nagercoil town. Transport services had also resumed and drinking water was being supplied with the aid of power generators.Rescue missionIndian Coast Guard (ICG), Thoothukudi station, said 133 fishermen in distress at sea had been rescued by both Eastern and Western Command of the ICG since November 30. The rescue mission had been intensified with the aid of ICG Ships  Aadesh, Abhiraj and Vaibhav. Air surveillance was also being carried out at regular intervals to spot and rescue the missing fishermen.Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had ensured rescue of the stranded fishermen with the aid of four ICG Ships each from the Eastern and Western Command and also air surveillance from INS Rajali, Mr. Jayakumar said.Ten kg of rice and kerosene would be supplied to each of the household in waterlogged localities.Trail of destruction was minimal due to precautionary measures taken by State governmentO.

They cultivate wheat and rice besides rearing cattle for milk but find it difficult to sustain my sports and support my three younger brothers too, he said.Four-time National gold medallist Ashutosh Kumar Singh is not only his coach but benefactor too, providing the special diet a power athlete needs.

Its secretary Hareram Kumar Singh laments that the only gym back home reserves entry only to the authorities and their associates.Its not an easy life for Sudama, who cycles five kilometres to the Government Higher Secondary School, Jamui, to train from 6 to 8 a.m. and follows that up with an evening session of similar duration.His planting foot skidded once, right at the crossover, when readying for a throw. The resultant lower back twist laid him low for six months.The rest helped him recover, he believes, rekindling dreams of glory reached by his role model Davinder Singh Kang."

RASS identified these enterprising persons, albeit with different forms and varying grades of physical disability, and formed them into 85-90 groups, locality-wise. The process was conducted in a meticulous manner by identifying prospective beneficiaries through a door-to-door survey in the Tirupati Urban and Rural mandals. With this initiative, the men and housewives with disabilities, became tailors, vegetable vendors and even graduates, thanks to the habit of thrift and the effective use of the interest thus generated.

Moreover, the market price of paddy has dipped.The spot price of the Matta variety was Rs. 1,800 to Rs. 1,850 a quintal at the Meenangadi market on Thursday against Rs. 1,500 a quintal a few weeks ago. It was Rs. 2,200 a quintal four months ago.The minimum support price for paddy has been fixed at Rs. 2,330 a quintal by the government, including the State intensive bonus of Rs. 1,550. But farmers in the region say they get only Rs. 1,800 a quintal.Reasons for price fallIt is sad that we are forced to sell our produce at such a low price, says Kesavan Keezhanikkal, a farmer in Panamaram. Traders push down the price of paddy during the Nancha harvest (winter crop) citing excess moisture content, he says.There is not much demand for paddy farmed n the district at the rice mills in Kalady and Palakkad owing to the cultivation of mixed rice varieties, according to Ibrahim, a paddy trader at Meenangadi.As per the data with the Principal Agriculture Office, Wayanad, paddy was cultivated on 8,000 hectares of land this season and 20,000 persons were engaged in its farming. But only 820 farmers have registered online to sell their produce at the minimum support price to Supplyco.Government normOnly cleaned paddy with less than 17% moisture content is being procured, farming sources said. The farmers are unable to fulfil this norm set by the government since it is difficult to dry the crop in cloudy weather.The agency is yet to complete paddy procurement that was to be completed four months ago during the puncha season in Padinharethara and Kottathara grama panchayats.Pest attacksA spurt in pest attacks and diseases owing to climate variation too is telling on the yield.

As they are certified organic growers, their produce is attracting demand.When we began field work in 2007, traditional varieties of paddy were cultivated hardly in 100 acres, recalled Jayaprasad Ballekere, chief executive officer of Bhoomi Sustainable Development Society. The Agriculture Department had involved the non-government organisation to promote organic farming in Sakleshpur, Alur taluks of Hassan and Somwarpet of Kodagu. A majority of farmers were after hybrid and improved varieties of paddy. Following constant efforts, now native varieties are grown in more than 1,500 acres in the three taluks, he said.Rajamudi considered good for diabetics, Navara with medicinal value, Ghamsala a scented variety, Rathna Choodi, Netti Bilakki, Holesalu Chippuga, Kempakki (red rice), and Kappu Akki (black rice) are the native varieties of paddy.Holesalu Chippuga is the best variety for puffed rice. Last year, I sold paddy at Rs. 4,500 per quintal. Almost the entire yield goes to places like Sangli in Maharashtra and Davangere, where there are many puffed rice producing units, said Y.C. Rudrappa, a progressive farmer of Yedehalli in Sakleshpur. He has been cultivating Holesalu Chippuga variety in eight acres of his land.Alur, Sakleshpur and Somwarpet taluks are known for heavy rainfall, which is well-suited for traditional varieties.Traditional varieties take 150-160 days for harvest and is suitable for this area. However, the duration of hybrid and improved varieties is about 120-130 days, said Mr. Jayaprasad. The organic farmers of Hassan and Kodagu districts have formed a federation to market their produces. Mr. Rudrappa, who is chairman of the federation, said more than 3,500 farmers are part of it.

In January, an amount of Rs. 177 crore followed by payment of Rs. 160 crore in March had to made for closing the Rs. 337 crore borrowed in 2007.In addition to the remittance of principal amount, interest of loans taken from financial institutions including from National Bank for Agriculture and Rural and Housing and Urban Development Corporation had to be paid.The interest payment alone would be to the tune of Rs. 30 crore.Totally we need to mobilise Rs. 370 crore in the next three months to avoid getting a defaulter tag. Once your credit rating takes a beating, it would be difficult to borrow from the open market and financial institutions. Mobilising an additional amount of Rs. 370 crore will definitely put a strain on the finances, a high ranking official told The Hindu .Recurring expenditureThe financial woes do not end with next year as repayment of principal will be a recurring expenditure from next year on. While in 2018-19 an amount of Rs. 350 crore had to be remitted, the sum goes up to Rs. 500 crore in 2019-20 and further to Rs. 600 crore in 2020-21.Of the total debt load of Rs. 7,755 crore, Rs. 4,567 crore was borrowed through RBI from the open market. The share of open market borrowing is about 63 per cent, said the official.The repayment of principal amount in January and March next year will certainly put additional burden as the funds had to be realised either through additional resource mobilisation or diverting plan funds.According to senior officials, resource mobilisation had come to a saturation point with the administration not having the leverage in altering tax structure, except for petrol and diesel, after the Goods and Services Tax regime came into force.This leaves the administration with the next option of diverting plan fund as an immediate solution for repayment, said another senior official.The long term solution, according to a retired official, would be to ensure financial prudence and eliminating completely or at least cutting down unproductive expenditures.With financial situation getting worse, it would be prudent enough for the political leadership to give the go-by to freebies and streamline welfare measures so that it get restricted only to the needy, the retired employee said.Long years of financial miss management by successive governments had taken a toll on the financial front. During the previous N. R Congress regime, around Rs. 80 crore was spent to provide free mixies and grinders.Officials worriedWhat was the necessity to provide mixies and grinders to all. Now, we are worried whether we will be able to get salary next month, said a lower-level official on condition of anonymity.The present government, especially the Social Welfare Minister, had been vocal in airing his views on free rice. He had even given an assurance on the floor of the house to stop free rice to income tax payees, tax paying traders and a section of government employees. But so far, it remained as a mere rhetoric, said the retired employee.There are around 3. 4 lakh cardholders in the Union Territory. Of this 1.5 lakh people belong to the above poverty line category, 1. 6 lakh in below poverty line (BPL) category and the remaining 30,000 in Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY).The government assessment itself, according to senior officials, is that the needy are the people in the BPL and AAY categories. The administration incurs an expenditure of around Rs. 21 crore per month.We can save at least Rs. 10 crore if we restrict it to BPL and AAY category.

So, there is scope for pilferage, said another official.Unless the government finds a way to stop unproductive expenditure, the way ahead would be extremely difficult, the officials cautioned."

P. Thankachan in tow, said the government should announce a compensation of Rs. 25 lakh for the next of kin of those who lost their lives in the Ockhi cyclone, over and above the benefits that fish workers are eligible under various schemes of the Fishermen Welfare Fund and Matsya Fund.He said the governments commitment was only Rs. 10 lakh per head out of the Rs. 20 lakh rehabilitation package it announced.The rest of the amount is made up from the Fishermen Welfare Fund and the insurance cover which they are normally entitled to.The promise to provide free education to the children of those killed in the cyclone was also bogus, since education was free for the fisherfolk.The main focus should be on providing employment to the dependants since a majority of those who lost their lives were comparatively young. The reconstruction of houses too was important, he said.The UDF took strong exception at the State government unilaterally announcing the rehabilitation package without holding discussions with the stakeholders or committing the proposals to an all-party meeting that the Chief Minister had convened for Friday. The promise of providing free ration was not delivered as the rice distributed was found to be contaminated, he said.Mr. Chennithala contested Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayans claim on the delay in cyclone warning, questioning the credibility of his sources. The manner in which the crisis was handled reflected the administrative collapse. There was no coordination between various departments and no effort was made to constitute a crisis management team."

MGR was Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for around 11 years and during that period, the country had four Prime Ministers Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. With all of them, MGR tried to maintain good relations.Panruti S Ramachandran (81), a close associate of MGR, and one of the key decision-makers in the late CMs government, observed that MGRs policy paid dividends to the State.In my view, MGRs line of thinking was this: After all, my political enemy is DMK. So why should I antagonise all the others? Also, with every move, he wanted to isolate the DMK while cultivating friendly relations with all other parties. That was his strategy.Basically, MGR never wanted a confrontational approach with the Centre. In this regard, he didnt mind ideological differences either. On one occasion, he told me that since he had no ambitions of becoming the Prime Minister of the country as some other CMs had, he would have cordial relationships with the Centre, no matter who becomes the PM. In 1977, he had alliance with Indira Gandhi for Lok Sabha elections. But when Janata party formed the next government with Morarji Desai as PM, MGR maintained close relationship with Desai. In the ensuing Assembly elections in 1977, he did not have any alliance with the Congress, he observes.Similarly, when the Desai government fell, though he supported Morarji, he joined the government headed by Charan Singh with two ministers from AIADMK. Later, in the next Lok Sabha elections, MGR went with Congress led by Indira Gandhi and the ties continued with Rajiv Gandhi after he became Prime Pinister following his mothers death.No PM aspirationsMGRs policy was neither doctrinaire nor self-seeking  like wanting to becoming the Prime Minister. For instance, NT Rama Rao wanted to become the Prime Minister and even convened a conclave of opposition parties in Vijayawada in 1983 and openly declared that he wanted to be next Prime Minister on behalf of the opposition parties. MGR and Ramachandran had even attended that conclave.Had this dont-antagonise-centre policy helped Tamil Nadu in anyway? Ramachandran believes so. Successive governments at the Centre were very cooperative with MGR. Tamil Nadu got more allotments in terms of rice etc., When it came to influencing the Planning Commission or Finance Commission, sanctioning of projects and allotment of coal, Tamil Nadu benefited because of MGRs policy.When the Sri Lankan Tamils issue came up, it was solely in the domain of External Affairs Ministry. But our relationship with Delhi was so cordial that we were able to influence foreign policy. Without our concurrence, the Centre did not do anything. So his policy helped the Tamils in Sri Lanka, Ramachandran says.Ideology too played its partSays Dr HV Hande (91), who was close to the late leader and was health minister in the cabinet, MGR believed that having a cordial relationship with Centre is good for the State. Due to the relationship, financial grants to the State were always good. Whatever MGR demanded for the State was granted. In that way, we benefited a lot.On MGRs decision to join the government headed by Charan Singh after the fall of Morarji Desai government, Hande observes: MGR wanted to prove that he has given life to the slogan raised by Arignar Anna, his political mentor  Maanilathil suyatchi; mathiyil kootatchi (self-rule in State, coalition rule in Centre). For the first time, a regional party became coalition partner of the Central government. Two Ministers from AIADMK took part in the Union Cabinet  Palapazhanur and Sathiyavanimuthu. MGR thought it was a huge achievement for a political party from a State. He was so happy that when the two ministers arrived from Delhi after assuming their charges, they were given a rousing reception.However, the decision to tie up with Charan Singh proved a disaster for the party in the next Lok Sabha election since the public mood was against the Janata government as well as Charan Singh government. In the eagerness to realise the goal of Anna, he had to pay a price, he adds.Hande recalls this with huge respect for MGR: One of the key aspects of MGRs political as well as film career was that he always had great faith in the peoples support for him and with that as focal point, he moved ahead. When his government was dissolved in 1980, he just went to the people with a single question - What wrong did I do to deserve this? And with peoples support, he returned to power.Support for Eelam causePolitical analyst Tharasu Shyam agrees with the perception that MGRs ties with Centre benefitted the State hugely. The Sri Lankan Tamils issue was grabbing headlines in 1982. MGR was in his second stint as Chief Minister at that time. He took special interest in resolving the plight of Lankan Tamils perhaps because he was born in Kandy in Sri Lanka when his parents lived there. He clearly understood that without Centres support of the, helping the Lankan Tamils would not be possible.Tamil Nadu is a State in India and Sri Lanka is a sovereign country. Under normal circumstances, LTTE and other groups fighting for liberation of Tamils and a separate Eelam country should have been regarded as terrorists in India. But they were treated as freedom fighters because of the close ties between the Centre and State governments at that time and Indira Gandhi allowed setting up of training camps for Tamil militant groups in Tamil Nadu. Even after Indiras death, support for these militant groups continued.Shyam says after Rajiv Gandhi became the PM, he showed special interest in resolving the ethnic crisis in Lanka and the first talks between the Sri Lankan government and militant groups in the presence of India took place at Thimpu, the capital of Bhutan. However, the talks did not bear fruit.But in all these developments, MGR could wield his influence in helping the Tamil militants of Lanka, particularly the LTTE led by Prabhakaran.Shyam also says the Constitution of India itself vests more powers with the Central government than the State. As of now, good relations with Centre is the only way to gain preference for the State. Three decades ago, MGR policy had helped Tamil Nadu a lot."

Optimum utilisation of the water brings it prosperity. Case in point: Vijayawada and its neighbouring areas. Despite being on the banks of the river Krishna, the region had been drought-prone and the water used to flow into the sea. The fortunes of the region changed for the better once the Prakasam Barrage was built.The barrage, which turned 60 on Sunday, is key to the development of the region. It not only helps in meeting the irrigation requirements of the coastal districts but also in supplying drinking water to the people. The barrage, apart from connecting Krishna and Guntur districts, has transformed the region into the rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh as availability (and storage) of water increased compared to the extent of cultivable land, explains writer and historian Dr GV Purnachand.Back in 1852, Charles Orr, with the designs conceived by Sir Arthur Cotton, built an anicut to address the problems of the region. But in 1952, a massive flood breached the anicut, necessitating the another project.That was when the then Chief Minister of the state Tanguturi Prakasam laid the foundation for the barrage in 1954. The project was completed on 24 December, 1957, and was inaugurated by the then Chief Minister Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy who named it Prakasam Barrage, recalls Water Resources Minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao.The barrage, which was constructed with Rs 2.3 crore, has been serving the needs of two crore people ever since.The barrage now has an ayacut of over 13 lakh acres in Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and West Godavari districts and has led to the stabilisation of the entire Krishna Delta region, points out Kolanukonda Shivaji, the convenor of Krishna Delta Parirakshana Samithi.It will serve for 50 more years without problemsTo mark 60 years of Prakasam Barrage, the State government will hold a function on December 29. Water Resources Minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao said that Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu will participate in the function to be held on the banks of river Krishna. The barrage has been serving over two crore people for the last 60 years. Several visionaries helped in making the project a reality. Hence, the Water Resources Department will host a function at which people who worked for the project will be felicitated by the CM, he said in a press interaction on Sunday after paying tributes to Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu at the barrage. He further added that the government, between 2002-04 and 2014-17, had spent Rs 91 crore for the fortification of the barrage. Thanks to CM Naidus foresight, the barrage will serve the people for another 50 years without any problem, he said."
5aeb22da9855b7179ad71987,"From Plate to Plough: Agri-futures, like China",http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-agri-futures-like-china-4968066/,2017-12-05,"(Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh) (Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh)In November, prices of most major kharif crops crashed below their respective minimum support prices (MSPs), triggering farm distress. One of the many reasons behind this situation is that planting decisions of our farmers are based on last years prices, rather than the prices expected at the time of harvest. Signals indicating future prices are largely absent as agri-futures have been decimated by excessive controls and regulation. It is time to think afresh and resurrect agri-futures in India.In 2003, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments decisions to allow futures markets in India  after a long gap  was hailed as a big and bold step towards better price discovery for farmers. This, in turn, was supposed to help farmers take informed planting decisions. In the initial years  2003-2007  agri-futures did show promising growth. But around 2007-2008, they were hit by the global food price crisis. Agri-futures picked up momentum again and peaked in 2011-2012. However, since then, there has been heavy government intervention in agri-futures with higher margin requirements as well as absolute suspensions, resulting in their near collapse.Chinese agri-futures have had a contrasting trajectory. The agri-futures market was introduced in the early 1990s in China. It struggled for a decade, but thereafter Chinese agri-futures had such a robust growth that by 2016, it was at the top of global chart, crossing the 1,000 million mark, dwarfing Indias 20 million contracts in the process.What lessons can India learn from China in order to promote its agri-futures and help its farmers in better price discovery? Very briefly, China experimented with several things, including inviting experts from the Chicago Board of Trade in the US, rationalising commodities and exchanges by closing down trade in many items and focusing on a few farm products, especially the less sensitive ones. However, to understand Indias story better, we need to look at the perceptions and actions of three key stakeholders: Policy-makers, regulators (FMC/SEBI), and commodity exchanges. A pre-requisite for the development of a agri-futures market is to have a stable policy environment.The government, including the regulator, should provide a favourable environment for the futures trade to flourish. Commodity exchanges have to invest in designing appropriate contracts for business development. Abrupt interventions, with frequent changes in stocking restrictions on private trade, have reduced the prospects of agri-futures in India. We collated information about various interventions related to margins and suspensions since 2003 and found that suspensions of agri-futures, as well as high margins, have been targeted more towards commodities that are perceived as sensitive in the common mans food basket (See graph). For example, tur, urad, rice have been suspended for more than a decade now. High margins for sensitive commodities, for example, 100 per cent for potato (August 2014), 95 per cent for chana (June 2016) and 70 per cent for sugar (September 2016) reflect the governments intention of blocking their futures trade.So, if one has to develop agri-futures in India, the first lesson is to stay away from sensitive commodities (for example, common rice, wheat, most pulses, and even sugar), at least for some time, till futures gain momentum and some depth. It would be prudent to focus on less sensitive commodities like oilseed complex (oilseeds, meals, and oils), feed (maize), cotton, basmati rice and spices. Once markets are developed and the regulator has a higher degree of comfort, the country can diversify to other commodities in the agri-futures portfolio. This is what China also seems to have done. The largest volumes in agri-futures have come from oilseeds. This points to the significance of the regulators role: Giving a clear direction in terms of the choice of commodities, and then staying the course by adopting a stable policy with minimal interventions.Second, for the government to be assured that speculators are not rigging markets, the regulator should allow only delivery-based contracts, at least till markets deepen. This is another lesson from the Chinese experience: All agri-commodities traded at the Dalian Commodity Exchange are physical-delivery based.Third, like its Chinese counterpart, the government of India should encourage state trading enterprises (STEs) to trade on the agri-futures platform. This will boost the governments confidence in agri-futures as it will have ample information from its STEs. In China, STEs, the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) for example, have a major presence in the agri-futures markets. COFCO is directly administered by Chinas State Council and is the largest food processor, manufacturer and largest exporter and importer in the country. It trades in agri-commodities like soybean oil and meal, palm oil, cotton and sugar in the futures market. Indias STEs like the MMTC, STC, PEC or even the FCI can participate on the agri-futures platform in a similar manner, helping it to deepen.Lastly, it has to be recognised that developing agri-futures is as much the responsibility of the regulator as that of commodity exchanges, and both need to work in harmony for the benefit of various stakeholders, especially farmers who need useful information about future prices for their products while they are planting those crops. Can the Narendra Modi government take bold decisions to revive the legacy of the Vajpayee government and scale new heights in agri-futures, say 200 million contracts by 2022? Remember, China crossed the billion mark in 2015.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

But, if he knew how badly digital works in the departments of his government, it might shock him. The Prime Ministers obsession with dragging India, kicking and screaming, into the digital age is admirable. But, if he knew how badly digital works in the departments of his government, it might shock him.Narendra Modi has shown more impatience to use technology to transform India than any other prime minister. In his passionate impatience he seems not to have noticed that most Indian officials do not share his passion. Technology reduces their powers to harass and control, and unless they do this, how can they qualify as burra sahibs. Nor has he noticed the evil tricks these officials devise to thwart his digital dreams. Last week, at that conference of global entrepreneurs in Hyderabad, the Prime Minister repeated for the umpteenth time that he wants foreign businesses to come Make in India. A day later he took time off from campaigning in Gujarat to attend a conference in Delhi where he boasted that his government had helped India climb 30 notches on the chart that measures countries on the ease of doing business.What the Prime Minister appears unaware of is that despite his appeals, foreign investors are not exactly lining up at Indias gates to invest in new projects. Could this be because the small things that make a huge difference have not yet changed? We now have magnificent, modern airports in Delhi and Mumbai (where once were grubby sheds) but the officials charged with passport control and Customs remain stuck in those socialist sheds. As someone who campaigned tirelessly in this column for the abolition of arrival forms for Indian citizens, I was astounded at Mumbai airport last week to see an official treat boarding cards as a replacement.My travelling companion had lost his boarding card but had a valid Indian passport and details of the flight on which he travelled. The stamp in his passport revealed the city he travelled from. This was not good enough for the immigration official. He demanded proof in the form of a boarding card. So despite the lateness of the night, despite weariness from hours of travel, we were forced to protest. A standoff was the result until senior officials intervened.Now even more travel weary, we were forced to observe another uniquely Indian procedure. Instead of moving on to collect our baggage, we lined up to have our passports inspected by an official who wanted to ensure that the earlier official had stamped our passports. After we collected our baggage, we queued once more to have our hand luggage x-rayed. Except perhaps at Pyongyang International Airport, weary travellers do not need to go through these checks anywhere. When I finally emerged into Mumbais steamy, smelly air, I found myself thinking that if I were a prospective foreign investor or a tourist, I would run for my life.The flaws of Indian officialdom are a serious problem as we saw recently when little Santoshi died of starvation in that Jharkhand village. Her mother said the little girl begged for rice before she died but for six months there had not been any supplied to this wretchedly poor family because the village ration shop demanded an Aadhaar card. As always in such cases, officials denied that Santoshi had died of starvation. Then, because media attention was intense, Santoshis hut was quickly filled up with bags of rice, edible oil and other rations. The media soon lost interest, and so we do not know how many other children are suffering because biometric technology is dodgy in rural India.The Prime Ministers obsession with dragging India, kicking and screaming, into the digital age is admirable. But, if he knew how badly digital works in the departments of his government, it might shock him. I have foreign friends who have changed their mind about travelling to India because getting a visa online (or otherwise) is so difficult. Online the website crashes with annoying regularity, and on earth the officials who man our consulates and embassies are of the usual obdurate, unfriendly kind. Mr Modi is the first Prime Minister who has noticed that foreign tourists could become a huge source of foreign exchange, but the whole of India continues to get less than half the tourists that Bangkok gets. With much, much more to offer, India got less than 9 million foreign travellers this year compared to more than 20 million who visited Bangkok.If the Prime Minister snaps out of the digital world that so enthralls him, he will find that the reason why he is being routinely taunted by Congress leaders for not bringing achche din is because of the resistance of officialdom to parivartan. Recent polls show that his personal popularity remains almost undiminished, but lower down the ranks there is a general feeling that minimum government has not even begun to happen. This is because far too many officials remain deployed in performing tasks that have become meaningless in our digital age. He needs to ask why this is so, despite nearly all our major states being governed by his team of chief ministers.Follow Tavleen Singh on Twitter @ tavleen_singhFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

However, the very act of physical violence  slashing with axe, beating and burning a human being alive stems out of impunity.Written by Sanjay MacwanIndia woke up to the shocking video clip of Shambhu Lal hacking labourer Mohammad Afrazul to death in Rajasthan some weeks ago. The cries of Afrazul pleading for mercy and his wife & daughters wailing for justice in television interviews will continue to haunt us. At the time of writing this article the intent for the pre-meditated murder is yet unknown. However, the very act of physical violence  slashing with axe, beating and burning a human being alive stems out of impunity.Every day I see this impunity being perpetrated on the poor in my efforts to combat human trafficking in India. I have seen and heard of thousands of victims enduring similar kinds of violence to that faced by Afrazul. I have felt the same chill running down my spine as I watched the act of violence by Shambu Lal. It is not much different from the human traffickers who unleash violence against the trafficked.Ive looked into the forlorn eyes of children who were forced to have sex with men thrice their age. One in two survivors of sex-trafficking victims have endured beatings with physical and sharp objects. In a bid to instil fear, several children have been forced to witness the murder of others, to ensure that few try to escape.Along with police we have found children being hidden behind walls and ceilings. In most rescues, children who are hidden in chambers do not even squeal for help  they are gripped by the fear of violence.I have met two men whose hands were chopped with an axe similar to that used by Shambu Lal. Both these men had refused to be bonded labourers in brick kilns. Thousands continue to be bonded in brick kilns across India where they are forced to make bricks. Pregnant women and children are not spared. Any form of resistance unleashes a tirade of violent tactics by their owners. Surviving on single meals, these enslaved labourers work round the clock in extremely unhygienic conditions.Shambu Lal typifies the every-day trafficker, the beneficiary of violence. The key intent to perpetrate violence for traffickers is money. Last year, sex-traffickers gained upto a 1000% profit while their capital investment was minimal. Traffickers are serious about investing in the tactics of violence. The violent methods transcend beyond physical brutality; traffickers use psychological and socio-economic norms to maintain oppression. There is a growth for slave masters not for the slaves.Toward the end of his video, Shambu Lal walks towards an unassuming Afrazul and attacks him mercilessly. This predatory instinct of violence captures the way the world of human trafficking works. The poor are preyed upon. By virtue of their poverty, they are not only vulnerable to hunger and disease, but also to violence. Recent statistics suggest that 400 million people are employed in India and 45 million remain unemployed. Thousands of these people are vulnerable to be trapped into the never-ending cycle of bonded labour and the hellish worlds of sex-trafficking.These probabilities are scary; the impact of trafficking is denting the Indian GDP and HDI.In 2016, India had the fourth highest proportion of modern day slavery estimated at 18.3 million. This includes victims of bonded labour and Commercial Sexual Exploitation (CBI). An estimated 3 million women and girls are sold for sex annually in our country. In addition there are nearly 4 million child labourers. It is shocking to note that such enslavement generates an estimate of 360 billion USD or Rs 21 lakh crores annually which is equivalent to one fifth of the countrys GDP of the year 2015.Victims of human trafficking contribute to the economic engine of the nation. We may see them, but we fail to recognise them. Wrapped in their enslavement, they seem to be all around us. They include those who build our roads, bridges and airports to those who suffer in their bodies to provides entertainment in brothels, bars and lodges. We have helped rescue those who pack food; put aromas in the agarbatties, polish rice that we eat, lay internet cables, put cement and mortar on the metro constructions and much more.Some states & districts have, indeed, enforced laws. Further, effective deterrence has led to decreased levels of violence among perpetrators. The probability of a male customer seeking a minor for sex in Kamathipura (Mumbai) or Sonagachi (Kolkata) has decreased. Previously, traffickers openly flouted young children for sex. Proactive police investigations and subsequent convictions have changed the dynamics of sex-trade in these cities. Traffickers now fear the law. Yet, there is more to be done.We have forgotten the poor who continue to stay outside of growth periphery. They remain outsiders of the development model. Their opportunities to participate are scuttled. How do we achieve sustained growth if the poor are held back by violence? Let us root out the no-entry and reserved entry board at the door of development.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5aeb24639855b7179ad71a51,The simple economics of clean air,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-simple-economics-of-clean-air-pollution-smog-4950117/,2017-11-23,"(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)(By E. Somanathan and Ridhima Gupta)By now, everyone in north-western India (and northern Pakistan) knows that one of the main reasons they are choking on smog is the burning of residue from the rice crop by farmers. Some people have also heard of the Happy Seeder, a machine whose use can do away with the need to burn residue. It fits onto a tractor and is capable of planting wheat without getting jammed by residue leftover after the rice harvest. What people dont know is that the cost of producing enough of the machines to eliminate burning entirely is very low.Eight years ago, a survey conducted by one of us (Gupta) found that there were fewer than a hundred farmers using the Happy Seeder in Punjab. Now there are 3,000, showing that adoption has been proceeding rapidly. But there is still a long way to go. A policy brief by the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences estimates that 1.2 lakh Happy Seeders would be needed to cover the entire area under the rice-wheat cropping system in India. There are presently about 15 manufacturers of the machine, and if they get enough orders they can bring the price down to Rs 1 lakh rather than the current sale price of about Rs. 1.3 lakh per machine. Also needed is another machine  the Super SMS (straw management system)  that fits onto the combine harvesters for rice in order to spread residue evenly over the field, making the Happy Seeder more effective. These machines presently cost about Rs 1.2 lakh each and only half as many (60,000 machines) are needed since combine harvesters can cover a greater area. At a large scale, the production cost of each machine would be about Rs 1 lakh each, so this works out to a total cost of Rs 1,800 crore for the purchase of enough machines to cover the required area throughout India.The government can announce a procurement policy for the Super SMS attachments and Happy Seeders for the next year with a guarantee to procure 80 per cent of the requirement with warranties and after-sales service to ensure quality. It can then auction the machines to farmers and hire-purchase operators who buy machines and rent their services to farmers. This would ensure the availability of enough machines giving farmers an alternative to residue-burning, next year. The policy of fines for residue-burning can then be strictly enforced without a political backlash. This needs to be combined with a public information campaign and an intensification of extension efforts. Together, these measures would ensure that there will not be a repeat of the problem next year, and in the years to come.The difference between the purchase price and auction price of each machine will be the government subsidy. It is likely to amount to much less than the total cost of the machine if the government makes clear its intention to enforce the fines for burning, and provides enough publicity, because then there will be high demand for the machines. The government would thus need an outlay of only a few hundred crore for this programme, a tiny fraction of the agriculture ministrys budget of Rs 40,000 crore. This would prevent a recurrence of the current disaster next year. In the long run, it is necessary to move away from the power and fertiliser subsidies and selective procurement of grain  these encourage a wasteful farming system.There are other big contributors to air pollution: Once a pollution cloud forms, the air gets trapped near the ground because sunlight is blocked. The normal process of air getting warmed during the day, and rising up and carrying away pollutants with it, stops. In winter, the cold and dimming from the pollution cloud cause increased lighting and heating demand, generating more pollution from heating fires by the poor and coal burning in power plants. And there is the ever-present pollution from diesel trucks and cars. Dealing with these other sources is also important and solutions may not be as immediate.As always, prevention is better than cure. Diesel combustion produces many-times-more-polluting fine particles than petrol. Currently, petrol costs about 20 per cent more than diesel. All that is needed to prevent new diesel cars being produced is to lower the petrol tax and raise the diesel tax so that the price difference is reversed. The myth that diesel taxation falls more heavily on the poor has now been thoroughly debunked (for example, in the book Fuel Taxes and the Poor edited by Thomas Sterner)  it is the rich and middle class who own vehicles, and it is they who buy most transported goods.A new study from the University of Maryland shows that sulphur dioxide (SO2) pollution declined by 75 per cent in China in the last decade while Indias SO2 pollution increased by 50 per cent. SO2 gets converted in the atmosphere to sulphate particles that form smog. China implemented SO2 pollution controls on coal power plants. Meanwhile, in India, regulations to control SO2 were issued as late as December 2015, and recently the power ministry wrote to the environment ministry to delay enforcement in some cases to as late as 2022.In many cases, there are lobbies that benefit from the status quo. Some auto companies opposed the advancement of Bharat VI standards to 2020 (previously 2024). As a result of the public outcry over air pollution last winter, the central government held firm on that issue. All governments respond to the demands made on them. Unless the public is vocal about demanding action on air pollution, progress will continue to be slow.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb265e9855b7179ad71b58,Bastar tribals can teach a thing or two to Ivanka-led global summit,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/bastar-tribals-can-teach-a-thing-or-two-to-ivanka-led-global-summit-4958650/,2017-11-28,"A cement road being laid between Sukma and Konta. (file/Express photo by Abhinav Saha) A cement road being laid between Sukma and Konta. (file/Express photo by Abhinav Saha)A fortnight ago, as a precursor to the Ivanka Trump-attended Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad which begins today, another summit took place in in Dantewada, in Chhatisgarh. Called the Tribal Entrepreneurship Summit, it saw the attendance of entrepreneurs from all over the country from tribal areas, who sat in the relatively new and shiny Atal Bihari Vajpayee Auditorium in Dantewada and narrated their ideas to their peers.Inside the hall, a massive projector relayed the speech of a minister of the Union government, and a message from MS Swaminathan, often called the father of Indian agriculture. For many in Bastar all of this was new, even a novelty. The real discussions were happening outside.In the lawns outside, the stalls stood cheek-by- jowl. Each came from a different tribal district in Chhattisgarh, some from neighbouring Odisha. As local tribal farmers from Dantewada slowly walked from one to the other, and found an unassuming someone behind the counter who seemed very much like them, the interactions opened up. Some asked whether coffee from Koraput could be grown in Dantewada, others talked about improving tamarind production. Most popular was a stall called Bhoomgaadhi, a farmer cooperative aided by the state government which is helping farmers return to organic farming using their unique knowledge set that have passed down from generations. Perhaps this is slowly turning into a model for the future.Across the jungles of Bastar, where myriad tribes have lived in harmony with nature for generations, visiting journalists, academics and researchers nearly always ask questions about education. Often, an answer will come that will point to the difference between being illiterate and being unlettered. For even though there might be a lack of formal education, the tribes have a wisdom of their own.The trees, the sky, the night, the animals that abound in the forest dont fill them with dread. There is no fear of the unknown. Simply because they arent the unknown. They share an intimate, symbiotic relationship, where one nourishes the other. The trees speak. So does the earth. And now, even district administrations have begun to bank on those conversations.In Kuakonda and Katekalyan for instance, two parts of Dantewada that are still considered severely Maoist-affected, the Bhoomgaadhi cooperative is now beginning to market and sell 35 different varieties of rice  a diversity found across a mere 10-village area. Chhattisgarh itself records 22000 different types of rice. For generations, farmers in these parts have known of their medicinal qualities, some good for joint pains, others good for an upset stomach. That understanding, that has little explanation, except for their relationship with the soil and the crop, is now becoming financially viable.Checks and balances are required, of course. The lines that merge into superstition and myth are thin and often crossed; officials in Dantewada are at the moment using science to verify claims before they market. Before Bhoomgaadhi products are sold, for instance, they are tested at government run institutes and certified.But if there are doubts about claims made from indigenous learning, the inverse is true as well. Officials repeatedly narrate tales of how claims made by farmers, of medicinal properties that certain varieties of rice contain, are borne out by science. Further, this knowledge of tribal villagers doesnt negate the need for formal education. Modern technology can often be complementary. In the age of scale, there remains the need to maximise output of these organic crops. Training sessions for System Rice Intensification(SRI), which details with the optimum space required between two planted stalks, or the kind of organic fertilisers that will maximise output must be imparted.Apart from the obvious economic benefits, such state-tribal cooperation also moderates the narrative of Maoist influence, never far away from any venture in Dantewada. Much Maoist support in the forests of Bastar is based not only on a development vacuum that existed for many years, but also in that vacuum, the sense of unfamiliarity and distance that has developed between the administration and its residents.The Maoist construct of the idea of the state is the other. The being that failed to understand the sensitivities of the people, that spoke another language, that had no regard for their well being, their traditions, or their customs. A state that dismissed any tribal idea as archaic, or illiterate.That is why Bhoomgaadhi is fundamentally an example of a long-delayed acknowledgement of respect. That respect is now becoming a two-way street. Once upon a time, Maoist decrees meant that no outsiders could enter the villages of Katekalyan. Now, government officials working on organic farming are welcomed by the villagers. The doors of communication are slowly opening. And therein lies both the tragedy and irony of Bastar. This encouragement of organic tribal farming from the government has come, after farmers in Dantewada, in particular, complained that government policies in previous years to increase production were becoming counterproductive.Their obsession with homogenous high yielding seeds were killing local diversity. Paired with chemical fertilisers, the soil was turning into a wasteland. Within Dantewada itself, there are varying degrees of Maoist influence. Areas along the National Highway or near the district headquarters like Geedam have seen high government influence the planting of homegenised crops, while places like Katekalyan and Kuakonda, distant and hostile, have stuck to their age old methods of agriculture, untouched by modernity.Yet even as the state government attempts to scale up organic farming, hoping to one day reach the day when rice supplied to anganwadis is produced locally, it is now urging farmers who once used government seeds and fertilisers to return to ways they once knew. In Dantewada, it is the eating of this humble pie that could be the beginning of a renewed and lasting relationship between the state and the citizens it once forgot to respect.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5aeb278c9855b7179ad71bf6,Aadhaar or else,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/aadhaar-biometric-authentication-abba-public-distribution-system-pds-jharkhand-4946834/,2017-11-21,"The obvious way, also used by banks and telecom companies, is to set a deadline and threaten to discontinue benefits after that. The obvious way, also used by banks and telecom companies, is to set a deadline and threaten to discontinue benefits after that.Recent events in Jharkhand shed some useful light on the damage done by compulsory biometric authentication in the Public Distribution System (PDS). This is increasingly a countrywide problem. The reason is that Aadhaar-based biometric authentication (ABBA) is being relentlessly pushed by the Central government, with little attention to the consequences.In Jharkhand, ABBA was first made compulsory for PDS users in Ranchi district in August 2016. By June 2017, it was mandatory in about 80 per cent of the ration shops across the state. This meant, of course, that Aadhaar itself was compulsory  no Aadhaar, no food. But making ABBA compulsory for PDS users creates two more serious hurdles for them.First, ABBA requires Aadhaar seeding. This means that PDS users must not only have an Aadhaar number, but also get this number correctly linked to their ration card. This is far from trivial. One difficulty, among others, is that seeding often creates inconsistencies between databases  in this case, between the ration-cards database and the Aadhaar database.For instance, names may be spelt differently in the two databases. At least some of these inconsistencies need to be resolved for successful seeding. The middle class recently discovered the hassles of Aadhaar seeding in the context of the PAN-Aadhaar linkage. The problem is much worse for underprivileged people. Many of them depend heavily on middlemen, who extract a price at every step.There is another difficulty with Aadhaar seeding. How is it to be achieved in good time, when people have no reason to hurry? The obvious way, also used by banks and telecom companies, is to set a deadline and threaten to discontinue benefits after that. If the deadline keeps getting postponed, however, the threat may not serve the purpose.At some point, therefore, the threat needs to be carried out. That is what happened on March 27, when the Chief Secretary of Jharkhand ordered Aadhaar-less ration cards to be cancelled. As a result, large numbers of people found themselves excluded from the PDS for no fault of their own. To add insult to injury, the Government of Jharkhand claimed that the cancelled cards were fake. But recent verification exercises in three blocks (Khunti, Mahuadanr and Manika) confirm that most of the concerned cardholders are alive and eligible. In much the same way, job cards and even pensions have been cancelled en masse in Jharkhand for the sake of achieving 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding.The second hurdle is monthly biometric authentication at the ration shop. This requires connectivity, a functional point of sale (PoS) machine, operational servers, and of course, successful fingerprint recognition. Official statistics and independent surveys point to high failure rates in Jharkhand  perhaps 10 to 20 per cent. The victims often come from vulnerable groups, such as elderly persons and manual labourers with rough fingerprints. Even those for whom ABBA eventually works, face much inconvenience, anxiety and waste of time.Some readers may feel that these hassles are a small price to pay for removing corruption from the PDS. There is growing evidence, however, that ABBA has revived rather than reduced PDS corruption in Jharkhand, at least for now.The main source of PDS corruption in Jharkhand is what people there call katauti (cuts). This means that the PDS dealer gives them a little less than their due  say 23 kg of foodgrain per month instead of 25 kg. In a recent survey of the PDS in 32 randomly-selected villages of Jharkhand, we found that the average katauti was the same (about 7 per cent) before and after ABBA was introduced. This is not surprising: If dealers have the power to give people less than their due, biometric authentication does not help.Meanwhile, a new form of corruption has emerged. Whenever biometric authentication fails for some PDS users, the dealers have some leftover grain (mainly rice, in Jharkhand) at the end of the month. Predictably enough, the leftovers are routinely siphoned off.Since transactions are now digitised, the Government of Jharkhand has a record of these leftovers. A few months ago, it decided to recover the leftovers, so to speak, by telling dealers that they should distribute from the accumulated leftovers until the gap is made up. This, however, led to chaos in the PDS, because many dealers had already sold the leftovers in the market. The problem was not just that they had nothing to distribute the next month, but also that if they did not distribute, the same situation would arise again the following month, since the recorded leftovers would remain the same.Short of buying rice in the market to distribute in the ration shop, the only way out for corrupt dealers is to rig the digital records. This is not easy, but it can be done. In Beltoli village of Latehar district, we found out one of the methods being used for this purpose. Under the National Food Security Act, every person listed on a priority ration card is entitled to 5 kg of foodgrain per month.In Beltoli, however, the dealer is telling people that this entitlement is now restricted to the names (not just the cards) that have been seeded with Aadhaar. Judging from 25 testimonies collected there this month, this practice enables the dealer to distribute just 60 per cent of the prescribed quantity while entering the full amount in the PoS machine. Further enquiries in neighbouring villages suggest that this practice is not confined to Beltoli.We heard of other methods too, including one whereby dealers simply tell people that it is Modis wish that they should undergo biometric authentication at least once without getting any rice. This enables them to record fake transactions with abandon. All this illustrates a more general point: In Jharkhand, ABBA has not reduced the power of PDS dealers, which is the real root of corruption. On the contrary, it has increased peoples dependence on the local dealer, because it is the dealer who knows the rules of Aadhaar seeding and biometric authentication.In response to the public outcry that followed recent starvation deaths in Jharkhand, the Central government has directed state governments to ensure that those for whom ABBA does not work are able to buy their PDS rations using an exemption register. This, however, is just a band-aid solution. If further tragedies are to be avoided, the Central government should stop insisting on ABBA and let the states use more appropriate technologies for last-mile monitoring.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

It has also come up suitable crop improvement technologies covering nutrients, irrigation and pest and disease management for the north-eastern zone of Tamil Nadu, especially for the districts of Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram.The rice varieties introduced by the station include TKM 6, TKM 9 and TKM 13. The TKM 6, which is a universal donor for Stem Borer resistance, was honoured by way of a monument installed at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI, Manila).The rice variety TKM 9, popularly known as red rice, is grown in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.All this while the Andhra rice varieties were famous in Tamil Nadu. But the TKM 13, released during 2015, has now become quite famous among farmers here, said an official from the research station. He said that it was the best alternative to BPT 5204 (samba mahsuri).Agriculture Minister R. Doraikkannu, Tamil Development Minister Ma Foi Pandiarajan, Tiruvallur Collector E. Sundaravalli and other government officials took part in the event. A monument, with details of various rice varieties, was also installed on the occasion."

However, introduction of the e-PoS (electronic-point of sale) system has helped the government save Rs. 490 crore so far out of Rs. 828 crore expected to be saved in the entire year (2017-18) since it prevents diversion of the quantity meant for these beneficiaries.An observation (sample study) made by the Civil Supplies Department has indicated that about 50% to 55% of the beneficiaries have been drawing rice and consuming it and 30% to 35% of them have been drawing the subsidised commodity but not consuming it. In other words, it is being sold by them to small traders in villages at about 10 to 12 times higher than the drawl price of Re.1 per kg and, ultimately, ending up in recycling, sources in the department admitted.It is stated that Minister for Civil Supplies E. Rajender had announced that ration cards were delinked from any other welfare scheme or requirement as address proof quite a few times but it was yet to come up in black and white. The State Government has not issued any order so far delinking ration cards for other needs and as a result it is still being asked for at various levels for availing schemes, the sources explained.Reduced allocationDelinking of ration cards from other schemes officially is expected to bring down the budget allocation to Civil Supplies straight away. The department is being allocated about Rs. 2,700 crore a year but with de-linking of ration cards from other needs would surely reduce it by about Rs. 400 crore to Rs. 500 crore since 15% of the beneficiaries have been holding on to them for other needs and have not been drawing rice and other commodities.It is understood that a loud thinking is also on in the government about supply of super fine quality rice as part of the PDS since a sizeable number of the beneficiaries are found to be not consuming the rice being supplied now."

(AP file Photo) West Ham United manager David Moyes. (AP file Photo)West Ham United manager David Moyes has questioned the Football Associations decision to hand midfielder Manuel Lanzini a two-game ban for simulation, saying there is a lack of consistency regarding incidents that warrant a suspension. Lanzini was banned for successful deception of a match official during last Saturdays 3-0 Premier League win at Stoke City, with an independent regulatory panel agreeing that the Argentine had dived to win the penalty that led to the opening goal.The FA rejected West Hams appeal of the ban on Tuesday, making Lanzini the second player to be retrospectively banned for simulation after Evertons Oumar Niasse. Im disappointed because I dont see much consistency, Moyes told reporters after West Hams 1-0 League Cup defeat by Arsenal.Theres another incident which was turned down. I wonder how they could get to that conclusion where everyone was unanimous on the decision. It sounds as if, Im not sure even in this room that everybody would be unanimous and that was what was said it had to be. Lanzini, 24, missed the away defeat to Arsenal in the League Cup quarter-finals and is also ruled out of West Hams home league game against Newcastle United.Moyes lauded his teams performance at the Emirates but felt experienced midfielders must be recruited in the January transfer window after 18-year-olds Domingos Quina and Declan Rice were fielded for a much-changed West Ham side on Tuesday. I think we have been making progress and winning games and weve been well organised and hard to play against. We showed that again tonight, Moyes added.But what were seeing as we go along is the next step is adding quality. Tonight we were short on midfield players and generally were short in that area and we could do with adding a little more craft. Its an area were short at the moment.

Chandrababu Naidu, Mr. Palekar claims that based on trials of this farming technique in fields in various Indian states, both crop productivity and incomes for farmers had doubled.Local varieties of rice and other crops gave better yield.For example, basmati rice gave an increased yield of 18-14 ton/acre using the ZBNF method. It is labelled as zero budget because the input costs of this method of farming are practically nil, and use only natural methods of manure, and other naturally abundant input materials.Hit with AP farmersWith the patronage of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, this method of farming will soon be adopted by farmers in AP within the next three years, he said.Mr. Palekar has set up a ZBNF training institute in Thirukazhukundram in Kancheepuram district, where training will be imparted to farmers and other interested parties in this method of cultivation.This institute was inaugurated on Thursday."

It has a rich history, having been ruled at various points by the Gurjara-Pratiharas (who first made it their capital), the Bundela Rajputs, the Delhi and Malwa Sultans, as well as the Mughals, Scindias, and the British. Yet, many in India have only heard of Chanderi in connection with the traditional textile craft for which the town in Madhya Pradesh is famous. At least, I only knew of Chanderi sarees.But Chanderi is much more than that. Tucked away in the hills on the edge of Bundelkhand and Malwa, this town, which was a major link for connecting trade routes, is of historical importance. The presence of various rulers, some of whom were enthusiastic builders, especially the Malwa Sultans, can be seen in the heart of the town in its many Jain and Hindu temples, huge rock sculptures, baolis (stepwells), tombs, chatris (dome-shaped pavilions), madarsas and dargahs. The grand vizier of emperor Akbar, Abul Fazl, in his 16th century work titled Ain-e-Akbari (Constitution of Akbar) mentions that Chanderi had 14,000 stone houses, 384 markets, 360 caravanserais, and 1,200baolis.Malwa style of architectureDuring the 14th century, when the Tughlaq rule in Delhi was on the decline, governors in the Deccan declared their independence one by one. Building activity was suspended in Delhi, and artisans and skilled labourers found generous patrons in Malwa where the kings were starting their construction activity. This combined with Persian influence gave rise to a Malwa style of architecture.According to the art historian Percy Brown, workmen were also recruited to Chanderi from Ahmedabad. While Tughlaq architecture can be best described as solid, it is hardly ornamental. The workmen who came from Gujarat were well known for their intricate stone latticework, which is most famously seen in the Sidi Saiyyed mosque in Ahmedabad. The stone latticework screens ( jaalis ), which are not only ornamental but also functional as they provide light and air, symbolised Chanderi town for me. But although I travelled through Chanderi to all its famous historical spots, including a massive rock sculpture of the Jain Thirthankara Adinath, what held me spellbound was a simple graveyard.Inside the cemetEryDriving into the town, I saw a board that read Hazrat Nizamuddin parisar  (compound). Old town houses stood in this area, but they were not what I was looking for. I had read of a beautiful grave complex there. A young boy, who saw our group wandering around, asked us what we were looking for and led us through some passages to what he called the qabristan, or cemetery, in the inner city. Inside these narrow lanes, I saw some exquisite jaalis with every kind of symbolic and geometrical pattern on them.We reached the cemetery. In every enclosed tomb was the Mihrab , a semicircular niche that indicates the direction of the Qibla , or the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca. The graves were neat and clean, and had no flowers or lamps on them. Most of the intricately carved grave cenotaphs lay under the open sky; a few were inside domes. The dome of one particularly beautiful grave had fallen down and the jaali was worse for wear. The jaalis had obviously seen better days.According to the Archaeological Survey of India, these are the graves of the family of the famous Delhi Chisthi Sufi Saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas descendants, who had come to Chanderi. However, the Delhi Nizami family says they have no records of anyone moving here. No book on architecture mentions this complex either. The origin of the complex, according to an inscription on one of the graves, goes back to the 15th century.However, what I could research were some of the symbols  thenagabandhana, or entwined snakes, for instance, which are carved on the stones and are magical even in their broken state. Their eternal knots symbolise the flow of time and movement. According to my friend Sudha Ganapathi, an iconography expert, many of the symbols on these jaalis are similar to the kolam patterns (geometrical designs drawn traditionally with rice powder outside homes) in south India."

Stem borer attack was also reported from a few places. However, there is no need to panic, said an official.Thrips causes leaf curling and discoloration.Stem borers can destroy rice at any stage of the plants growth from seedling to maturity.They attack tillers, leading to drying of the central tiller during vegetative stage and cause whiteheads at reproductive stage.BiopesticidesAgriculture Department officials said directions had been issued to agricultural officers to curb the spread of pests.The department is also helping the farmers in pest management and preventive measures. Farmers have been asked to use biopesticides to control pests.The department is reaching out to farmers through campaigns, community radio, etc.They will help farmers implement automation in spraying operations, popularisation of seed drum, production of biopesticides, biofertilizers and biocontrol agents, tricho cards, drones and light traps.Climate changeOfficials say one of the main causes for increase in pest attack is climate change and warn that damage could be massive in future.Daily monitoring and implementation of preventive measures are needed to avert the attack, they add."

(Agencies/Files) Beijings move to turn off the taps completely is rare. (Agencies/Files)China exported no oil products to North Korea in November, Chinese customs data showed, apparently going above and beyond sanctions imposed earlier this year by the United Nations in a bid to limit petroleum shipments to the isolated country. Tension has flared this year over North Koreas nuclear and missile programmes, pursued in defiance of years of UN resolutions. Last week, the UN Security Council imposed new caps on trade with North Korea, including limiting oil product shipments to just 500,000 barrels a year.Beijing also imported no iron ore, coal or lead from North Korea in November, the second full month of the latest trade sanctions imposed by UN China, the main source of North Koreas fuel, did not export any gasoline, jet fuel, diesel or fuel oil to its isolated neighbour last month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Tuesday.Beijings move to turn off the taps completely is rare. In March 2003, China suspended oil supplies to North Korea for three days after Pyongyang fired a missile into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. Chinese exports of corn to North Korean in November also slumped, down 82 percent from a year earlier to 100 tonnes, the lowest since January. Exports of rice plunged 64 percent to 672 tonnes, the lowest since March.Trade between North Korea and China has slowed through the year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February. In November, Chinas trade with North Korea totalled $388 million, one of the lowest monthly volumes this year.China has renewed its call on all countries to make constructive efforts to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, urging the use of peaceful means to resolve issues. But tension flared again after North Korea on Nov. 29 said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile test that put the US mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. Meanwhile Chinese exports of liquefied petroleum gas to North Korea, often used for cooking, rose 58 percent in November from a year earlier to 99 tonnes. Exports of ethanol, which can be turned into a biofuel, gained 82 percent to 3,428 cubic metres.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

It said Kim was reportedly a key figure in North Koreas efforts to switch its missile program from liquid to solid fuel, while Ri was reported to be a key official in its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) development.Treasury is targeting leaders of North Koreas ballistic missile programs, as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate (North Korea) and achieve a fully denuclearized Korean Peninsula, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.The move followed new United Nations sanctions announced last Friday in response to North Koreas November 29 test of an ICBM that Pyongyang said put all the US mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. Those sanctions sought to further limit North Koreas access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad.North Korea declared the UN steps to be an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade.The standoff between the United States and North Korea has raised fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula, which has remained in a technical state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice not a peace treaty.Washington has said that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea. It says it prefers a diplomatic solution, but that North Korea has given no indication it is willing to discuss denuclearization.KREMLIN OFFEROn Tuesday, the Kremlin, which has long called for the two sides to hold negotiations, said it was ready to act as a mediator if the United States and North Korea were willing for it to play such a role.Russias readiness to clear the way for de-escalation is obvious, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The US State Department and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Moscows offer.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who made a similar offer on Monday, told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Tuesday that Washingtons aggressive rhetoric and beefing up of its military presence in the region had heightened tensions and was unacceptable, Russias foreign ministry said.It said Lavrov underscored the need for the fastest move to the negotiating process from the language of sanctions.Washington has stressed the need for all countries, especially Russia, and China  North Koreas main trading partner  to fully implement sanctions, including by cutting off oil supplies.According to Chinese customs data, China exported no oil products to North Korea in November, apparently going above and beyond UN sanctions imposed earlier this year.Beijing also imported no North Korean iron ore, coal or lead in November, the second full month of those trade sanctions, the data showed.Beijing has not disclosed its crude exports to North Korea for several years, but industry sources say it still supplies about 520,000 tonnes, or 3.8 million barrels, a year to the country via an aging pipeline.North Korea also sources some of its oil from Russia.Trade between North Korea and China has slowed through the year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February.Chinese exports of corn to North Korean in November also slumped, down 82 percent from a year earlier to 100 tonnes, the lowest since January.

(Source: AP) Various officials of the Argentine Football Association, including Luis Segura who took over the presidency after Grondona, also face corruption charges. (Source: AP)The FIFA corruption trial in New York illustrates the political power of soccer in Latin America, with tentacles reaching beyond the field and possibly into the office of a national president.During testimony this week, a South American soccer and marketing official alleged a web of bribes connected to the administration of former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez and the governments telecasting of professional soccer matches.The program, known as Futbol Para Todos (Soccer For All), gave the entire country games for free. And it gave Fernandez air time  before, during and after matches  to promote her governments accomplishments and counter criticism without rebuttal.The equivalent would be if the United States government were to take over the televising rights for the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NBA and NCAA and televise everything for free, said Mark Jones, who teaches Latin American politics at Rice University in Houston.On her Facebook page on Thursday, Fernandez called a headline in daily La Nacion, which linked her to bribes in Futbol Para Todos, fake news.If the cover of La Nacion were from a foreign paper, I would sue for malice and false headlines in that country and I would surely win, she wrote.In the trial this week, prosecution witness Alejandro Burzaco _ the former head of the Argentine sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias _ told jurors of paying millions in bribes to Julio Grondona. Grondona was the powerful head of the Argentine Football Association for three decades until his death in 2014, and also a senior vice president of soccers world-governing body FIFA.Burzaco also testified about bribes paid to Jorge Delhon and Pablo Paladino in exchange for TV production rights to soccer matches. Delhon and Paladino both worked on Futbol Para Todos.Delhon committed suicide on Tuesday in suburban Buenos Aires by throwing himself under a train hours after Burzaco implicated him. Paladino denied the accusations in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday.What we see is this huge web of corruption that not only involved Julio Grondona and the Argentine Football Association, but also reached into the highest level of government, Jones said.Fernandezs state-run coverage of Argentina soccer began in 2009. Using a populist appeal, she said at the time that all of her compatriots had the right to watch soccer on television _ not just those who could pay for it. It is not possible that only the ones that can pay can watch a match, she said, standing next to Grondona and Diego Maradona, who was coach of the national team at the time.Fernandez said that having the games only on pay-to-view television was kidnapping goals from the public.It was Grondona who tore up the existing pay-for-view agreement with local broadcasters and handed the rights to the Fernandez government.Futbol Para Todos could only happen with Grondonas approval because Grondona was around for so long and controlled everything, said Christopher Gaffney, author of Temples of the Earthbound Gods, which looks at the politics of soccer in Argentina and Brazil.The Futbol Para Todos programming ended this year with the rights now in the hands of private broadcasters Fox and Turner. The move was pushed by new Argentina President Mauricio Marci, who took over from Fernandez in 2015. Macri was once the president of Buenos Aires soccer club Boca Juniors.Also this year, an Argentine court opened criminal proceedings against two of Fernandezs former chiefs of staff  Anibal Fernandez (no relation) and Jorge Capitanich  for allegedly taking public funds earmarked for Futbol Para Todos.Various officials of the Argentine Football Association, including Luis Segura who took over the presidency after Grondona, also face corruption charges.Football (soccer) is a way to reach the masses in Latin America without having to do much, Gaffney added. Here the government was streamlining access to this opiate, which is football.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb39cc9855b73f522c7fe8,Meals that passed the taste test...,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/meals-that-passed-the-taste-test/article22329709.ece,2017-12-30,"This is my favourite time of the year. Not just because of the weather, and the festivity, and all the hope that comes with the New Year. I like these last days of the year also because it gives me an opportunity to go back and relive some of my happy food moments.Food-wise, 2017 was a happy year, indeed. Just a few days ago, I had Ghalibs tender tikkas, and kicked myself for not having gone there for long years. Ghalib Kabab Corner (Ph no: 9810786479) is situated opposite the Markazi mosque in Nizamuddin. The buffalo meat tikkas and seekh kababs are so deliciously juicy that the taste stays with you long after you have polished off a whole plate. In these days of high prices, when an egg costs more than a bun-omelette did a few years ago, the rates are incredibly reasonable, too. A plate of 16 tikkas is for Rs. 50, as is a plate of four, big-sized seekh kebabs.When it comes to fine dining, my happiest meal was at Guppy, a restaurant in the Lodhi Colony main market (Ph no: 011-24690005) which serves Japanese food. I went with some friends, who asked for its signature pork belly and tenderloin cube steaks  and both dishes were superb. The slow braised pork was soft, thick with fat, glazed with soy honey and redolent with the strong flavour of mustard. The pan-seared tenderloin cubes came coated in a mildly sweet sesame seed-flavoured sauce that gave it a delightful punch.Another memorable Asian meal was at a tiny restaurant called Little Saigon in Hauz Khas Market (Ph nos: 9650260408 and 9599450879). I loved the pancakes prepared with rice powder and beaten egg, served with lettuce leaves and smeared with a light fish sauce. I enjoyed the fresh summer roll with shrimp and meat and the fragrant yet light entres of sticky rice and braised pork and yellow chicken curry.During a visit to Kolkata this autumn, I went to an old favourite  called How Hua  which had reopened after remaining shut for many years. The place was known for its chimney soups, and its still the hot favourite in the reopened restaurant, on Prince Anwar Shah Road (Ph no: 0-7595999413). The soup came in a big vessel  large enough for a small family  and the broth was full of pieces of chicken, prawn, fish, vegetables, crab, tofu and vermicelli, as well and meat and fish balls. What I missed was their French pork chop. But I shall leave that for another day.One place that I hope to see a lot of in the coming year is a little caf called The Tea Lounge in Bikaner House in Pandara Road. The Tea Lounge serves an English high tea and an Indian high tea.The former comes with your choice of tea or coffee, three kinds of sandwiches (chicken, mint and cheese), walnut tart, lemon tart, mushroom khari, almond cookies and ginger biscuits, while the latter comprises kachoris and samosas.Discerning palateRun by Old World Hospitality, it offers savouries such as keema samosas, chicken patties and cheese and chilli patties. The keema samosa I ate was spilling over with the keema it had been stuffed with. On the sandwich menu are chicken sandwiches, ham and cheese roll, coleslaw roll, cheese and mint sandwiches.For fish loversIf you enjoy your fish, then you should not miss Sana-di-ge (Ph nos: 011-40507777 and 7042794546) in the Malcha Marg market. Beautifully done up, the restaurant offers various kinds of coastal cuisines  and I had a superb tawa fried seer fish, chicken ghee roast, where chicken chunks marinated with freshly ground spices and garlic had been roasted in ghee. I enjoyed the mamsa pepper fry, boneless lamb cooked with oodles of pepper and curry leaves, and ended the meal with a lovely and creamy sweet dish called eleneer payasum  sweetened coconut cream with the pulp of tender coconut.Another little place that gave me a lot of joy this year was Anmol, known far and wide for its butter chicken. This is not the regular butter chicken that you get in restaurants, but a juicy tandoori chicken in hot, melted butter. The chicken is grilled on a coal fire and then tossed with chillies, dried mango powder, chaat masala and chutney. Butter is melted till it is golden yellow, and then poured over the chicken.It was, as you can see, a good year. And now heres to 2018. Let there be good food, and no ones stomach ever empty."

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) In this Sunday Nov. 26, 2017, photo, Jamila Begum, 35, cries when talking about how members of Myanmars armed forces accused of massacring civilians in her village Maung Nu, in Myanmars Rakhine State, killed her son and husband during an interview with The Associated Press in Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)For six hours he hid in an upstairs room, listening to the crackle of gunfire and the screams of people being slaughtered outside his Myanmar home.With every footstep that drew near, every cry that pierced the air, 52-year-old Bodru Duza braced for the soldiers to find him, to kill him like all the others who had fled to his compound that morning seeking a safe place to shelter. They were being blindfolded and bound, marched away in small groups, then butchered and shot as they begged for their lives.What had started out as a quiet Sunday in northwestern Myanmar had spiraled into an incomprehensible hell  one of the bloodiest massacres reported in the Southeast Asian nation since government forces launched a vicious campaign to drive out the countrys Rohingya minority in late August.By the time it was over, there was so much blood on the ground, it had pooled into long rivulets across the uneven earth, among bits of human flesh and the fragments of shattered skulls.When Duza finally dared to emerge from his hiding place, he wondered how anyone could have survived.The compound he grew up in was now consumed by an ethereal silence. His wife, daughter, and five young sons were nowhere to be seen. And as he crept toward a backdoor to escape, he stumbled upon the corpse of an unknown boy sprawled on the floor.Oh Allah! he thought. What have they done to us? What have they done to my family?___The Associated Press reported this story with a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.___Duzas family belonged to the ethnic Rohingya Muslim community, which has long been persecuted and denied basic rights in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar. They lived in the village of Maung Nu, where at least 82 Rohingya are believed to have been murdered on Aug. 27.The massacre was part of a streak of violence that started before dawn two days earlier, when Rohingya insurgents staged an unprecedented wave of 30 attacks on security posts across Rakhine state. At least 14 people were killed.The assaults triggered one of the greatest catastrophes the Rohingya have ever known: an army counter-offensive that has left hundreds of villages burned and driven 650,000 refugees into Bangladesh. The aid group Doctors Without Borders estimates 6,700 Rohingya civilians were killed in the first month of reprisals alone, and human rights groups have documented three large-scale massacres.The Associated Press has reconstructed the massacre at Maung Nu as told by 37 survivors now scattered across refugee camps in Bangladesh. Their testimony and exclusive video footage from the massacre site obtained by AP offer evidence, also documented by the United Nations and others, that Myanmar armed forces have systematically killed civilians.Myanmars military did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story, and the government  which prohibits journalists from independent travel to northern Rakhine State  did not reply to an AP request for a visit. The army has insisted in the past that not a single innocent has been slain.For as long as anyone could remember, there was only one place in Maung Nu that was truly considered safe. It was a large two-story residence shared by two of the villages most prominent businessmen  Duza and his brother Zahid Hossain.Built on a hillside more than half a century ago, the vast home was known for its three-foot-thick walls of hardened mud, which many believed to be bullet-proof and virtually impossible to burn. That mattered in Rakhine state, where the Rohingya population lived in fear of both the military and the areas ethnic Rakhine Buddhists. Although the Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for decades, they are still seen as foreign invaders from Bangladesh who are intent on stealing land.Despite the tensions, Hossain worked extensively with local army commanders, trading cows and rice and jointly operating a brick-making factory. Both brothers were charismatic, educated and popular. Duza, an affable man who was well-known throughout the area, had previously served as village administrator for 12 years. Many people assumed that neither he nor his compound would be harmed.In this Monday, Nov. 27, 2017, photo, Mohamed Yaha, 18, demonstrates to The Associated Press in his tent in Jamtoli refugee camp in Bangladesh, what he saw when soldiers bound the hands of dozens of men behind their backs with nylon rope and blindfolded them with scarves taken from the women when they massacred his village Maung Nu. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) In this Monday, Nov. 27, 2017, photo, Mohamed Yaha, 18, demonstrates to The Associated Press in his tent in Jamtoli refugee camp in Bangladesh, what he saw when soldiers bound the hands of dozens of men behind their backs with nylon rope and blindfolded them with scarves taken from the women when they massacred his village Maung Nu. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)After insurgents launched their first attacks a year ago, the government had imposed strict new measures aimed at curbing militant activity. Islamic schools were closed, a curfew was put in place, and authorities ordered the removal of fences and even shrubbery so security forces could see inside private compounds.But Maung Nu, a village of about 2,000 people also known as Monu Para, remained peaceful. Duza and his brother counted their blessings. They were among the villages wealthiest men. They owned scores of cows and buffalo, and vast acres of rice.Soon, it would all be gone.A few hours after midnight on Aug. 25, fierce volleys of gunfire woke the residents of Maung Nu. Rohingya militants had launched a surprise assault on a Border Guard Police post in Hpaung Taw Pyin, less than a kilometer (a mile) to the north.The fighting lasted until dawn. According to the government, two officers and at least six of the assailants died.That morning a commander from the armys Light Infantry Battalion 564, based just south of Maung Nu, called the local district administrator, Mohamed Arof, furious.Why didnt you tell us about these attacks? the commander demanded.I didnt know anything about it, replied Arof, a Rohingya. I only heard the shooting, like you.The same day, police snatched Arofs 15-year-old son from a rice paddy and took him to their camp, where he was hung with a rope along with three other teenagers, according to Arof and several witnesses. Its unclear why the teens were killed, but word of their deaths spread quickly.Fearing more reprisals from security forces, most of Hpaung Taw Pyins residents fled. Hundreds of them walked to the homes of friends and relatives in Maung Nu, in the hope they would be safe there.And for a day, they were.On Aug. 27, bursts of gunfire echoed across Maung Nu again. This time only the army was shooting.Several military trucks parked on the villages main road around 9 a.m. and began disgorging troops who fanned out on foot, firing into the air. Peering out a window of her home, 35-year-old Jamila Begum spotted several armed soldiers crossing her yard carrying coils of nylon rope.Hundreds of people were already on the move, seeking the closest refuge  the hillside compound of Duza and Hossain, which included half a dozen other homes belonging to their relatives and a large rectangular pond. Jamilas family joined them.Other residents were being rounded up by force and ordered to head to the compound. Some cowered inside their homes, wondering what to do. One of them, 18-year-old Mohammadul Hassan, put a womans veil over his face when troops burst through the front door of his home, guns drawn.In this Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2017, photo, Shafir Rahman, 50, describes how he watched a soldier hammering a four-inch nail into the side of a mans head with a rifle butt during an interview with The Associated Press in his tent in Jamtoli refugee camp in Bangladesh. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E) In this Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2017, photo, Shafir Rahman, 50, describes how he watched a soldier hammering a four-inch nail into the side of a mans head with a rifle butt during an interview with The Associated Press in his tent in Jamtoli refugee camp in Bangladesh. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)Hassan immediately recognized one of the soldiers  a skinny army staff sergeant named Baju who was well-known in the village. A member of the 564th Battalion, Baju had lived in the area for 15 years and spoke the Rohingya dialect, according to numerous villagers. Duza said Baju was also a frequent visitor to his home.When the soldiers discovered Hassan hiding among several female relatives, they became enraged. He was dragged outside along with two of his brothers, shoved to the ground and kicked until blood poured from his left eye.As troops ripped clothes off the women and seized their valuables, the three brothers were stripped and tied up. The soldiers marched them to Duzas compound naked, at gunpoint, the sunbaked dirt road burning their bare feet.___Duza had never seen people so scared.As the number of Rohingya hiding on his property rose into the hundreds, his wife, a warm woman with an easy smile named Habiba, turned to him and asked, Whats happening? Whats going on?The answer came when dozens of helmeted soldiers in olive green uniforms arrived around 11 a.m., accompanied by several border guard police.Their entrance set off a new panic. A few men in Duzas house locked the main wooden doors and climbed the stairs to a balcony, where most of the males already had gathered.Before joining them, Duza pulled Habiba aside.Please take care of our daughter and our sons.So many people were crammed into their house by then, though, that Habiba soon lost track of all but one child.Outside, a soldiers voice rose above the others. It was Baju, and he was calling on everyone to come out, assuring them they would not be harmed. As the minutes passed and nobody emerged, the calls turned menacing, and the sergeant threatened to burn the compound to the ground.Several bursts of gunfire rang out and a young boy was struck in the forehead. The women recoiled in horror as he lay motionless before them, the back of his skull blown apart.Seconds later, soldiers broke down the doors and began dragging people out, separating the men from the women.Mothers and elderly women were ordered onto their knees. Some tried to push back when troops ripped off their headscarves and tore at their clothes. The soldiers first demanded their cell phones, then grabbed at exposed breasts as they snatched gold earrings, necklaces and wads of cash.About 20 or 25 of the women  mostly attractive and young  were taken away. They were never seen again. The rest eventually were driven, along with their children, into a pair of houses on the property.The soldiers bound the mens hands behind their backs and ordered them into the dirt courtyard in front of the house, where they were forced face down onto the stifling ground. Most were blindfolded with masking tape or veils taken from the women. A handful who tried to resist were thrown off the balcony head-first.Troops started to walk across the sea of people, grinding boots into their heads and beating them with rifle butts. Some of the soldiers cursed their prisoners, calling them dirty kalar, a derogatory word for Muslims that is frequently used in Myanmar.Duzas brother, Hossain, begged for the violence to stop.Why are you doing this? he cried. Why are you tying us up?There was no answer.Around noon, a senior officer called a commander on his phone. The officer said they had rounded up 87 men.What should we do with them?The call ended shortly afterward, and the officer barked an order to his troops.Let us begin.___In this Saturday, Nov. 25, 2017, photo, Bodru Duza, 52, demonstrates how he hid in his house when members of Myanmars military forces accused of massacring civilians in his village Maung Nu, in Myanmars Rakhine State, during and interview with The Associated Press in his tent in Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh.

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)Duza watched through a slit in a closed window as a soldier plunged a long knife into his brothers neck in front of their house. When two of Hossains sons got up and tried to run, soldiers opened fire.Duza stepped back in shock. He scrambled to an upstairs room and crawled into the only place he could think of to hide: a foot-high space under a large wooden container normally used to store rice. He covered his legs with rice sacks and curled into a ball, trying to disappear.Outside, screams like hed never heard before reverberated across the courtyard.Several soldiers hammered four-inch nails into the temples of three men on the ground with the butts of their rifles. Four other men were decapitated, including a prominent gray-bearded mullah.Then a pair of soldiers  one was Baju  descended on her husband. With two-foot-long machetes, they hacked into his neck from both sides. He crumpled in the dirt, gagging on blood.Gasping for breath, Jamila stumbled toward the door. She wanted to rush to his side, to help him, to be with him  to die.But the women in the house pulled her back.You cant go, one said, as Jamila collapsed, weeping. If you go out there, theyll kill all of us.While women rocked back and forth, several children began praying. In the courtyard, they could hear people begging for their lives.Please Allah! Please help us!Were dying!When Jamila rose to look out the window again, she saw her 16-year-old son dragged away by the collar of his shirt and tied to a tree, screaming, I didnt do anything!The gunshots rang out. Jamila could not bear to look.___In this Sunday Nov. 26, 2017, photo, Jamila Begum, 35, cries when talking about how members of Myanmars armed forces accused of massacring civilians in her village Maung Nu, in Myanmars Rakhine State, killed her son and husband during an interview with The Associated Press in Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh.

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)As the afternoon wore on, the carnage became more methodical.Men and teenage boys were taken away in small groups and killed by firing squads near a forested area on the edge of the property. In some cases, a soldier blew a whistle beforehand, signaling for them to begin.Other troops wrapped corpses in orange and green tarps and transported them downhill in three-wheeled push-carts to a pair of army trucks parked on the road. Several witnesses reported seeing soldiers digging pits and dumping bodies into them.When Mohammad Nasir was marched to the killing ground with six others, he saw more than a dozen cadavers crumpled there under the trees. As those beside him braced for death and called out Islamic creeds  There is no god but Allah! Mohamed is his prophet!  Nasir wriggled loose and ran.He made it to the far side of a small ravine before the first burst of gunfire rang out. Half an hour later, when he had run out of breath, he realized he had been shot in the elbow.Mohammadul Hassan was taken to a pond just east of the main house. Soldiers ordered him to kneel with his two brothers, then shot them all from behind and rolled them over to make sure they were dead. When Hassan unexpectedly opened his eyes, an officer sitting on the bank walked casually forward and fired a single rifle shot into his chest. Hassan later regained consciousness, stumbled away, and survived.That afternoon, soldiers began searching the compound for men. At one point, Baju grabbed Duzas 9-year-old son Mohamed Ahasun, and demanded to know where his father was.The boy said Duza had left four days earlier for another village. Baju slapped him, but let him go.In the tiny, darkened crawl space upstairs, Duzas mind had gone numb. He kept telling himself: It has to stop  This has to end somehow. Praying for survival, he waited for the soldiers to discover him, to drag him out by the feet.But they never did. And when the guns finally fell silent, he crept slowly downstairs, and slipped away.For the next two weeks, he traveled alone, joining the hordes of Rohingya bound for Bangladesh. They crossed streams and forests and mountains, and finally the Naf River, which separates the two countries.When Duza got out of a boat and stepped onto Bangladeshi soil, he looked back toward Myanmar and saw half a dozen columns of smoke curling skyward from burning Rohingya homes. His family, he thought, was surely dead.___There is no way to independently confirm the death toll in Maung Nu. But one handwritten tally seen by The AP details the names, ages and professions of 82 people, most of them men and boys from Maung Nu and Hpaung Taw Pyin, who family members say were killed.They are farmers and students, carpenters, businessmen and teachers. The youngest is seven years old; the oldest, 95.According to Arof, the village administrator, at least 200 more remain missing and are feared dead.Most of the survivors struggle to understand why so many of their neighbors were slaughtered. Arof said the army falsely believed they were supporting the insurgency, but something much deeper had driven the killing. The massacres reported since August have stood out for their high casualty toll, their ferocity, and the methodical way in which they were carried out.You have to understand  they hate us, Arof said. This didnt only happen in our village, it happened everywhere.In the end, Duza was one of the luckiest survivors.After weeks spent imagining another life without a family, he found a newly-arrived refugee with a Myanmar phone and asked to use it.He dialed his wife Habibas number. A young girl answered.In this Saturday Nov. 25, 2017, photo, Bodru Duza, 52, third from right, kisses his sons as he sits for a portrait with members of his family in a tent in Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh.

(AP Photo/Wong Maye-E)He could barely believe it. It was his 14-year-old daughter, Taslima.As tears welled in his eyes, Duza asked about the rest of his family. Are they with you? Are they alive?Yes papa! Yes! Taslima replied. Were here! Everybody is fine.Duzas family had been elsewhere in the compound when he fled. It would take them six more weeks to make the journey to Bangladesh.When the family reunited in a refugee camp, Duza broke down as he hugged his wife and squeezed the children he never thought hed see again. They had lost so much  their friends and relatives, their home, their savings, their future  but they had somehow found each other.It felt like living in another world, Duza said. It felt like a new life.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The TDB subsequently had to stop the production and distribution of Appam for the pilgrims, provoking an angry response from Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran.InappropriateTerming the restriction imposed by the Food Safety Department inappropriate and crossing all limits, the Minister told a press conference that the timing of the decision gave room for suspicion. He also alleged that the officials were causing inconvenience to the pilgrims.Food Safety officials said the analysis of samples had yielded conclusive evidence of food colour contamination.We detected the presence of Tartrazine Yellow and Brilliant Blue additives which are used in tandem to impart green colour to cardamom. The results of the tests done at the analytical lab at Pampa were later confirmed by the NABL-accredited lab in Thiruvananthapuram, an official said. Tartrazine and Brilliant Blue have been linked to cancer, asthma, allergies and stomach ailments.On Monday, a press note issued by the office of the Food Safety Commissioner here alleged that the TDB was levelling baseless allegations to cover up the issue.The press note said the Food Safety Department had been ordered by the High Court to keep a close tab on raw materials used for preparation of prasadam at Sabarimala. One sample each of jaggery and rice flakes (avil) and two samples each of rock candy (kalkandam) and cardamom did not conform to food safety standards. The consignments were withheld at Pampa and the government, TDB, and High Court informed of the situation, the press note said. Food Safety officials said the issue could have been averted if TDB had procured the materials well before the start of the pilgrimage season."

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) Pope Francis is greeted by children in traditional clothes upon his arrival at Yangons airport, Myanmar, Monday, Nov. 27, 2017. The pontiff is in Myanmar for the first stage of a week-long visit that will also take him to neighboring Bangladesh. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)Pope Francis opened a diplomatically fraught trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh on Monday by immediately diving into the crisis over Myanmars crackdown on Rohingya Muslims: He met with the countrys military chief, even before beginning the official program of his trip.The Vatican didnt provide details of the contents of Francis 15-minute courtesy visit with Gen. Min Aung Hlaing and three officials from the bureau of special operations. It took place in the residence of the archbishop of Yangon, Cardinal Charles Bo, who has resisted international condemnation of the militarys operations against Rohingya as ethnic cleansing.The general is in charge of security in Rakhine state, where the militarys clearance operations against the Muslim minority have sent more than 620,000 Rohingya fleeing into neighboring Bangladesh. Refugees there have told of entire villages being burned and women and girls being raped.Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said only that They spoke of the great responsibility of the authorities of the country in this moment of transition.Gen. Min Aung Hlaings office said in a statement on Facebook that he is willing to have interfaith peace, unity and justice. The general added that there was no religious or ethnic persecution or discrimination in Myanmar, and that the government allowed different faith groups to have freedom of worship.Rohingya Muslims have faced state-supported discrimination in predominantly Buddhist country for decades. Though members of the ethnic minority first arrived generations ago, Rohingya were stripped of their citizenship in 1982, denying them almost all rights and rendering them stateless. They cannot travel freely, practice their religion, or work as teachers or doctors, and they have little access to medical care, food or education.Originally, the meeting was planned for Wednesday, after Francis was to have met with the countrys civilian leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, in the capital. The Vatican didnt say why it was moved up.Rohingya in recent months have been subject to what the United Nations says is a campaign of textbook ethnic cleansing by the military in Rakhine. But Myanmars Catholic Church has publicly urged Francis to avoid using the term Rohingya, which is shunned by many locally because the ethnic group is not a recognized minority in the country.Francis has already prayed for our Rohingya brothers and sisters, and much of the debate in the run-up to the trip focused on whether he would do so again in expressing solidarity with the Rohingyas plight. Any decision to avoid the term could be viewed as a capitulation to Myanmars military and a stain on his legacy of standing up for the most oppressed and marginalized of society, no matter how impolitic.Burke didnt say if Francis used the term in his meeting with the general, which ended with an exchange of gifts: Francis gave him a medallion of the trip, while the general gave the pope a harp in the shape of a boat, and an ornate rice bowl.The trip was planned before the latest spasm of violence erupted in August, when a group of Rohingya militants attacked security positions in Rakhine. Myanmar security forces responded with a scorched-earth campaign that resulted in Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, where they are living in squalid refugee camps.In the Kutupalong refugee camp in southern Bangladesh, Senu Ara, 35, welcomed Francis arrival for what he might be able to do for the refugees.He might help us get the peace that we are desperately searching for, she said. Even if we stay here he will make our situation better. If he decides to send us back, he will do so in a peaceful way.But in Myanmar, the sentiment was different. The government and most of the Buddhist majority consider the Rohingya Bengali migrants from Bangladesh living illegally in the country, though Rohingya have been here for generations.Being a religious leader _ Catholic leader _ means that he is well-regarded, but of course there is this worry if he says something, people might say, `OK, he just came to meddle, said Burmese analyst Khin Zaw Win, a former political prisoner. So, I think a lot of diplomacy is needed, in addition to the public relations.Seaman Kyaw Thu Maung said the issue is difficult because the term Rohingya carries so much political weight for all of Myanmars people.But my feeling is that if the pope is going to talk about the Rakhine issue, the people arent going to like the pope anymore, he said.Upon his arrival in Yangon, the pope was greeted by local Catholic officials and his motorcade passed by thousands of Myanmars Catholics, who lined the roads, wearing traditional attire and playing music.Children greeted him as he drove in a simple blue sedan, chanting Viva il papa! (Long live the pope) and waving small plastic Myanmar and Holy See flags. Posters wishing Francis a heartiest of welcome lined the route into town.En route from Rome, Francis greeted journalists on the plane and apologized for the expected heat, which was 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) upon his arrival and is expected to rise during his stay.On Tuesday, Francis begins the main protocol portion of his weeklong trip, meeting with Suu Kyi and other officials. He is to deliver a speech to her and other Myanmar authorities and diplomats in the capital, Naypyitaw, in what will likely be the most closely watched speech of the trip.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb48fd9855b7179ad72d93,More pressure on John Conyers to resign after new accusations,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/michigan-congressman-john-conyers-sexual-advances-allegations-4959703/,2017-11-29,"Republican John Conyers has been accused of sexually harassing female staff members. (AP Photo/File) Republican John Conyers has been accused of sexually harassing female staff members. (AP Photo/File)A former staffer to John Conyers says the Michigan congressman made unwanted sexual advances that included partially undressing in front of her in a hotel room and inappropriate touching, prompting more calls for the longest-serving member of the House to resign.Deanna Maher, 77, who ran a Michigan office for Conyers from 1997 to 2005, told The Associated Press Tuesday that the first incident occurred in 1997 during a three-day Congressional Black Caucus event in Washington, which she said she felt honored to attend.Maher said while she was in the bedroom of a hotel suite, Conyers walked in, called room service and ordered sandwiches. I had my nightclothes on, said Maher, who now lives in the Holland area in western Michigan. I was just scared to death. I was married at the time. He sat in the bedroom taking his clothes off. I didnt say anything and he didnt say anything.Nothing happened between them, she added. He didnt go naked. He was down to his skivvies, Maher said. He sat there eating sandwiches and then he stormed out and slammed the door. I was so embarrassed and ashamed of myself for being so stupid. I needed a job.He didnt put his hand on me, but the message was loud and clear, she said.The latest revelation came on a day Conyers met with members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the groups chairman said afterward that a decision on resigning was up to Conyers, hardly a vote of confidence for the 88-year-old lawmaker.Thats a personal decision for him and his family, Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., told reporters. Asked if he thinks Conyers will make the right decision, Richmond said, He always does.Conyers was first elected in 1964 and was one of the founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said he met with Conyers on Tuesday to let him know he was concerned for him.I think he should go home and talk to his constituents and listen to them and make a decision based on that, Thompson said. Some of the Detroit Democrats House colleagues are calling for him to step aside.Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York was joined Tuesday by Rep. Pramila Jayapal from Washington state in calling for Conyers to step down.The House Ethics Committee is investigating allegations against Conyers, who has denied the accusations and refused to resign. He announced Sunday that he would step aside as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.Separately Tuesday, the Houses top Democrat said in a letter to the ethics panel that it should move quickly with its inquiry. We are at a watershed moment for our country in the fight against sexual harassment and discrimination, wrote Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat. The Committee on Ethics has a great responsibility to proceed expeditiously as well as fairly into any investigation of credible harassment and discrimination allegations.The Senate Ethics Committee could also soon be investigating allegations made against Sen. Al Franken after radio news anchor Leeann Tweeden accused him of forcibly kissing her on a USO tour in the Middle East in 2006, before he was elected to office. Tweeden also released a photograph of Franken appearing to grope her breasts while shes sleeping. Two women have also come forward to accuse Franken of grabbing their buttocks while posing for photographs.Franken has apologized and said he welcomed an investigation. The lawmakers are among a number of prominent men in politics, entertainment and journalism who have been accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of explosive allegations against former Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. Also last week, Rep. Joe Barton apologized for a nude photograph leaked on social media.Mahers allegations against Conyers initially were reported by The Detroit News. She said there were other incidents involving unwanted touching in a car in 1998 and unwanted touching of her legs under her dress in 1999.Conyers was driving the two to a Detroit-area airport in 1998 when he began touching her leg, Maher told the AP. He was feeling me up, she said. He was an older guy, a terrible driver and all over Interstate 75. He was stopped by a (Michigan State Police) trooper.Conyers attorney, Arnold Reed, said Mahers allegations are uncorroborated and Conyers denies wrongdoing. John Conyers has always said hes not guilty of harassing these women, Reed said. Any woman or man that is violated, thats unacceptable _ completely unacceptable. By the same token, a person has right to protest his innocence. This is what we call due process. Mr. Conyers wants to be cooperative and will be cooperative with any investigation.Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that the 88-year-old lawmaker had settled a complaint in 2015 from a woman staffer who alleged she was fired because she rejected his sexual advances.BuzzFeed reported that Conyers office paid the woman over $27,000 to settle the complaint under a confidentiality agreement. BuzzFeed also published affidavits from former staff members who said they had witnessed Conyers touching female staffers inappropriately or requesting sexual favors.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Supriyo alleged that the state government had not only renamed central projects as its own, but also failed to submit an account of usage of those funds.The chief minister has been touring the districts, saying she had been giving people rice at Rs 2 per kg, but the truth is that Food Corporation of India (FCI) was buying the rice at Rs 33 per kg of which the Centre was providing Rs 29.67 per kg. The state was paying Re 1 per kg. In spite of the Centre paying 91 per cent subsidy, the state government did not even mention its contribution, he said.Similarly, Supriyo said wheat was procured by FCI at Rs 24 per kg, of which the Centre was paying Rs 21.45 per kg and consumers were paying Rs 2 per kg. The state government has no contribution in this, but is trying to take all the credit, he said.He also held some printed documents as he spoke of how much money was allotted for central projects such as housing schemes, NREGA and Swachh Bharat and Amrut.

(File) There remains some debate in the Philippines about what is considered a utility. (File)Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has instructed government agencies to scrap or start easing barriers that foreigners face in multiple business and employment sectors, part of moves to liberalise an economy long criticised as restrictive, reports news agency Reuters.The directive, made public on Thursday, said the aim was to pursue stronger economic growth, create fairness and to enable partnerships to develop. Dutertes directive ordered government agencies to take immediate steps to lift or ease restrictions on foreign participation, including those that will require new legislation.The directive specified eight areas or activities where changes will be made, including construction and repairs for government-funded projects, private recruitment for both domestic and overseas employment, teaching at higher education levels, as well as processing and trading except retailing of rice and corn.Some of the eight are broad and open to interpretation, such as retail trade enterprises, domestic market enterprises and public services other than those recognised as utilities. There remains some debate in the Philippines about what is considered a utility.The directive, dated November 21, also called for openness in particular professions where allowing foreign participation will redound to public benefit. For several years, the Philippines has been posting some of Asias fastest rates of growth> Its third-quarter expansion of 6.9 percent from a year earlier beat forecasts.The government is targeting annual growth this year of 6.5-7.5 percent, propped up by a higher state spending and stronger exports and agriculture output. But investors have lamented the obstacles to foreign firms, many because of archaic laws that limit foreign participation, some of which require time-consuming legislative amendments.Foreign direct investment into the Philippines is dwarfed by that of rivals such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, something the government is eager to change by slashing red tape and launching an ambitious, six-year, $180-billion, Build, Build, Build infrastructure splurge, which would modernise airports, roads, railways and ports.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb4a839855b7179ad72e5c,"Australian Parliament allows same-sex marriages, first weddings expected in February",http://indianexpress.com/article/world/australia-same-sex-marriages-gay-marriage-lgbt-4972023/,2017-12-07,"Same-sex marriage campaigners and volunteers cheer as they call on politicians to pass marriage equality legislation during rally outside Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, Thursday (AP photo) Same-sex marriage campaigners and volunteers cheer as they call on politicians to pass marriage equality legislation during rally outside Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, Thursday (AP photo)The Australian Parliament voted on Thursday to allow same-sex marriage across the nation, following a bitter and divisive debate settled by the government polling voters in a much-criticised ballot survey that strongly endorsed change.The public gallery of the House of Representatives erupted with applause when the bill was passed to change the definition of marriage from solely between a man and a woman to a union of two people excluding all others. The legislation passed with a majority that wasnt challenged, although five lawmakers registered their opposition to the bill.The Senate passed the same legislation last week 43 votes to 12. After royal assent and other formalities, the law will likely take effect in about a month, with the first weddings expected about a month later.Amendments meant to safeguard freedoms of speech and religion for gay-marriage opponents were all rejected, though those issues may be considered later. The government has appointed a panel to examine how to safeguard religious freedoms once gay marriage is a reality in Australia.Lawmakers advocating marriage equality had argued that the national postal survey in November mandated a change of the marriage definition alone, so changing the law should not be delayed by other considerations.It is now our job as members of Parliament to pass a fair bill that does not extend or create any new discriminations, an emotional government lawmaker Warren Entsch, who helped draft the bill, told Parliament. It is a strong bill that already strikes the right balance between equality and freedom of religion.Its an historic day for Australia today and I think the celebrations around the country when we finally  achieve marriage equality are going to be immense, Janet Rice said before the vote. Rice is a minor Greens party senator who was only able to remain married to her transgender wife of 31 years, Penny, because Penny remained listed as male on her birth certificate.Penny Wong, an opposition Labor Party senator who has two children with her lesbian partner, said: I am feeling happy.Gay marriage was endorsed by 62 percent of Australian voters who responded to the government-commissioned postal ballot.Most gay rights advocates believed the government should have allowed marriages years ago and saw various ideas for a public survey as a delaying tactic. The U.N. Human Rights Committee had called the ballot survey an unnecessary and divisive public opinion poll.The current bill allows churches and religious organizations to boycott gay weddings without violating Australian anti-discrimination laws.Existing civil celebrants can also refuse to officiate at gay weddings, but celebrants registered after gay marriage becomes law would not be exempt from the anti-discrimination laws.One of the rejected amendments would have ensured Australians could speak freely about their traditional views of marriage without fear of legal action. It was proposed by Attorney-General George Brandis and supported by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, both gay marriage supporters.Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who was a high-profile advocate for traditional marriage, told Parliament that Turnbull and opposition leader Bill Shorten had failed to deliver detailed protections for freedoms of speech, conscience and religion in the bill.A promise was made by the leaders of this Parliament and the promise has not adequately been delivered on, Abbott said.Abbott pointed to an Australian teenager who lost her job for advocating against gay marriage on social media and an Australian Catholic bishop who was taken before a state anti-discrimination tribunal over a pamphlet he published extolling traditional marriage. The complaint against the bishop was dropped.The last thing we should want to do is to subject Australians to new forms of discrimination in place of old ones that are rightly gone, he said.Government lawmaker Trevor Evans ruled out an Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court case in which a baker who refused to provide a wedding cake for a gay couple argued he was exercising artistic freedom and was exempt from Colorado anti-discrimination laws.Lets be honest here, for a case like that to arise in Australia, it would require a gay couple who care more about activism than about the success of their own wedding, to find a business operator who cares more about religious doctrine than the commercial success of their own small business, and for both of them to commit to having a fight, Evans told Parliament.Typical Australians would genuinely question the bona fides of the players in a case like that and the slim prospects of that occurring doesnt warrant the pages and pages of commentary and debate that have been dedicated to it, he added.Several gay marriage opponents in Turnbulls conservative coalition have regarded marriage equality as inevitable and have welcomed an end to an issue that has long divided the government ranks.Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, a same-sex marriage opponent who oversaw the postal ballot, said he felt great satisfaction that the issue was resolved.It was a polarizing issue on which good Australians had strongly and sincerely held views on both sides of the argument, Cormann said.I and my colleagues on the coalition side always took the view that the best way to resolve a disagreement in the community like this is by giving the Australian people which we did, we kept faith with it, the Australian people embraced the process and the result was emphatic, he said.The result is a political win for Turnbull, who became prime minister after deposing Abbott in 2015 in an internal government leadership ballot.Abbott was head-butted by a gay rights advocate during the postal survey campaign in September. Kevin Rudd, a center-left Labor Party prime minister whom Abbott defeated in elections in 2013, blamed the postal ballot for an assault on his godson Sean Foster, 19, as he campaigned for marriage equality a week earlier.Veteran gay rights campaigner Rodney Croome said he expected the first same-sex weddings in Australia would not take place until February.The law will likely take effect after a month. State laws then require couples to give 28 days notice of their intention to marry, Croome said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Post-Ockhi cyclone, fishermen have not ventured out into the sea from this fishing hub.S. GopakumarS_GOPAKUMARThe Latin Catholic Church has decided to intensify its agitation until all fishermen left stranded in the outer sea by cyclone Ockhi are rescued. A meeting of the pastoral council under the Thiruvananthapuram archdiocese of the Church, convened by Archbishop Soosa Pakiam M., decided to launch day-and-night agitations at various places including Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Tuticorin on December 11. A demonstration will also be taken out to the Raj Bhavan in protest against the the delay in rescuing those missing.Secretariat siegeVicar-General Eugene H. Pereira told mediapersons that the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard were hesitant about expanding their search in the outer sea. The Church demanded that the Centre deploy defence aircraft in the rescue effort. The agitation will continue until the last person is rescued. We will lay siege to the Secretariat from December 13 with the bodies of victims, if our demands are not met, he said.He added that 285 fishermen from the district alone were yet to be rescued. The Church also reiterated its demand to declare the incident as a national disaster.Ministers visitEarlier, Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan and Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran visited the Archbishop in a bid to assuage the concerns of the Church. Finance Minister T.M.

They are Jude, 42, of Tuticorin, and Antony, 41, of Adimalathura.The bodies of two more fishermen were brought to the hospital from Vizhinjam on Friday. Eighteen bodies have been brought to the hospital till date. Among the deceased, nine are yet to be identified.Meanwhile, distribution of free ration of 15 kg of rice to those affected by the cyclone has commenced in the district. According to the District Supply Officer, the supply is in addition to the existing monthly quota being provided through ration outlets.CounsellingThe affected families of Vizhinjam, Poovar, Beemapally, Konchiravila and Valiyathura were given counselling under the aegis of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the State Mental Health Authority. Disha counsellors visited the areas and interacted with the families of those killed or injured in the disaster.Those who lost their property were also found to be under immense mental distress.Of the 70 people counselled, 17 have been recommended for further treatment."
5aeb4c549855b7179ad72f4f,Gulf nations await crucial summit on Qatar diplomatic crisis,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/gulf-nations-await-crucial-summit-on-qatar-diplomatic-crisis-4968594/,2017-12-05,"Kuwait prepared on Tuesday to host a crucial meeting of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council as half of its members still boycott member-state Qatar, a diplomatic dispute thats cleaved the Arabian Peninsula. The fact the meeting will take place at all comes as a surprise, given the unusually sharp criticism among the typically clubby members of the GCC pointed at Doha.That alone, however, wont be enough to salvage the GCC, a group of American-allied Gulf Arab nations formed in part in 1981 as a counterbalance to Shiite power Iran. The United States and its European allies all have told the councils members that the region remains stronger with them working together as a whole, while the countries themselves still appear divided over their future.This is the most important annual summit the GCC has held for more than two decades, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. The GCC needs to illustrate its relevance after having been bypassed at every stage of the Qatar crisis.The dispute began in June, following what Qatar described as a hack of its state-run news agency that saw incendiary comments attributed to its ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Soon after, GCC members Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates closed off their airspace and seaports to Qatar, as well as the small peninsular nations sole land border with Saudi Arabia. The boycott initially reeled Doha, though it soon replaced food products with those flown in from Turkey and Iran.However, Qatars foreign reserves have dropped by some $10 billion a fifth of their value since the dispute began. Those reserves are crucial in supporting the nations riyal, which is pegged to the US dollar, as well as funding the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup that Doha will host. For boycotting nations, they allege Qatar funds extremist groups and has too-cozy ties to Iran. Qatar has long denied funding extremists but it restored full diplomatic ties with Iran during the crisis. Doha shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Tehran that gives its citizens the highest per-capita income in the world.A similar dispute involving Qatar erupted in 2014. But this time positions have hardened against Qatar, whose support for Islamist opposition groups has angered the Arab nations now boycotting it. The UAE in particular views Islamists as a threat to hereditary rule in its federation of seven sheikhdoms. Egypt, angered by Qatars support for the Muslim Brotherhood and the nations deposed President Mohammed Morsi, is also boycotting Doha.The US, which has some 10,000 troops stationed at Qatars sprawling al-Udeid Air Base as part of its campaign against the Islamic State group and the war in Afghanistan, also has sought to end the crisis. Its military has halted some regional exercises to put pressure on the GCC to resolve the crisis. However, President Donald Trump in the meantime made comments seemingly supporting the Arab nations efforts at isolating Qatar, complicating those efforts.A Trump-prompted call in September between Qatars Sheikh Tamim and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that offered a chance at negotiations also broke down in mutual recriminations. Kuwaits 88-year-old emir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, has tried to mediate the dispute, so far without success. However, Kuwait appeared in recent days to secure promises from the GCC to attend its annual high-level summit.It remains in question who will attend from each member state. Bahrain had sworn it would not attend any meeting that featured Qatar, though a lower-level official attended a meeting of GCC foreign ministers on Monday in Kuwait City. Qatars Shiekh Tamim already committed to attending, while Oman said another official would represent Sultan Qaboos bin Said. Ahead of the summit, however, Kuwait showed it remained committed to Gulf unity. Staffers from the Doha-funded Al-Jazeera satellite news network, which boycotting nations have demanded be shut down, openly reported from the summit and one of its journalists spoke live to Kuwaiti state radio.But the GCC meeting also represents more than just the Qatar crisis. The long-stalemated Saudi-led war in Yemen suffered a new setback with the death Monday of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who recently defected from the Shiite rebels holding its capital. Meanwhile, a new generation of Gulf leaders is rising, like Saudi Arabias assertive 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the Yemen war and has been more confrontational with Iran.The Saudi camp is seeking to commit the Gulf states to a hard-line anti-Iran policy and adherence to Saudi leadership, Ayham Kamel, the head of the Middle East and North Africa division of the Eurasia Group, wrote in an analysis published Tuesday. While the UAE believes its interests are best served by an alliance with Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain is compelled to follow Riyadhs lead, the other Gulf states are much more hesitant to do so.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb4cb59855b73f522c8a1f,Incidence of anaemia high among tribal people in Coonoor,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/incidence-of-anaemia-high-among-tribal-people-in-coonoor/article21376171.ece,2017-12-09,"It has been a week since M. Rani, a 40-year-old Kurumbar woman residing in Kil Sembakarai in Coonoor, received a blood transfusion at the Coonoor Government Hospital.Ms. Rani, who complained of dizziness and fatigue before being rushed to hospital, is among half of the Kurumbar residents residing in the village, who are either malnourished or are anaemic.The 37 Kurumbar families residing in the village had earlier been growing a variety of crops, including ragi, corn and millets, which they used to consume for a relatively wholesome nutrient meal.However, with more people moving out from the village, giving up farming and working on the tea estates nearby in Adderley, necessitating a change in diet predominated by rice from the ration shop, local residents say that their health indices have fallen correspondingly in the subsequent years.J. Raman, who suddenly fell ill more than two weeks ago says that locals still rely on harvesting forest produce, including yams and vegetables, but added that most families subsist primarily on the rice given to them at the ration shops. Most people make a rice broth, and eat that on most days of the week. They have to work and earn a wage to subsist, and it's so much easier for them to just live off the ration rice, said Raman.Tribal rights activists working in the belt believe that the diet of the tribal people, which has become rice-based, could be leading to a deterioration of their health in the long run.M. Alwas, Secretary of the Nilgiri Adivasi Welfare Association (NAWA), which sends doctors to Kil Sembakarai every month to treat anaemia, thalassemia, and sickle-cell anemia, which occur at a higher rate of incidence among tribals in the Nilgiris when compared with other communities, said that the group has been advocating to the government the need to distribute nutritious food items to the tribal communities living in the Nilgiris.There definitely is a correspondence of anaemia occurring among communities which have a poor rice-based diet. Their food habits were completely different and have changed over the years as ration rice is much more easily available to them, said Mr. Alwas.The community of Kurumbars living in Kil Sembakarai also complain of a lack of basic infrastructure, including housing facilities. Most of the families live in temporary houses made of sheet-metal.With leaky roofs and shaky walls, the residents say that they fear that the houses may come down during the rainy season, and called on the district administration to help build houses for them.The Nilgiri Adivasi Welfare Association, said that doctors were visiting the community every month and distributing medicine."

How Francis bridges the local Catholic concerns with his legacy of speaking out for oppressed minorities is the key to watch in his speech in Naypyitaw.Francis dove into the crisis hours after arriving on Monday by meeting with the commander responsible for the crackdown, Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, and three members of the bureau of special operations. The Vatican didnt provide details of the contents of the 15-minute courtesy visit, only to say that They spoke of the great responsibility of the authorities of the country in this moment of transition.Gen. Min Aung Hlaings office said in a statement on Facebook that he is willing to have interfaith peace, unity and justice. The general added that there was no religious or ethnic persecution or discrimination in Myanmar, and that the government allowed different faith groups to have freedom of worship.Rohingya Muslims have long faced state-supported discrimination in the predominantly Buddhist country and were stripped of citizenship in 1982, denying them almost all rights and rendering them stateless. They cannot travel freely, practice their religion, or work as teachers or doctors, and they have little access to medical care, food or education.Myanmars Catholic Church has publicly urged Francis to avoid saying Rohingya, a term shunned by many here because the ethnic group is not a recognized minority in the country. And they have urged him to toe a delicate line in condemning the violence, given the potential for blowback against Myanmars tiny Catholic community.Francis previously has prayed for our Rohingya brothers and sisters, lamented their suffering and called for them to enjoy full rights. As a result, much of the debate before his trip focused on whether he would again express solidarity with the Rohingya. Any decision to avoid the term and shy away from the conflict could be viewed as a capitulation to Myanmars military and a stain on his legacy of standing up for the most oppressed and marginalized of society, no matter how impolitic.Burke didnt say if Francis used the term in his meeting with the general, which ended with an exchange of gifts: Francis gave him a medallion of the trip, while the general gave the pope a harp in the shape of a boat, and an ornate rice bowl.Pope Francis arrives at Yangon International Airport, Myanmar November 27, 2017. REUTERS Pope Francis arrives at Yangon International Airport, Myanmar November 27, 2017. REUTERSThe papal trip was planned before the latest spasm of violence erupted in August, when Myanmar security forces responded to militant attacks with a scorched-earth campaign that has sent many Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh.In the Kutupalong refugee camp in southern Bangladesh, Senu Ara, 35, welcomed Francis arrival for what he might be able to do for the refugees. He might help us get the peace that we are desperately searching for, she said. Even if we stay here he will make our situation better. If he decides to send us back, he will do so in a peaceful way.But in Myanmar, the sentiment was different. The government and most of the Buddhist majority consider the Rohingya Bengali migrants from Bangladesh living illegally in the country, though Rohingya have been here for generations. Being a religious leader _ Catholic leader _ means that he is well-regarded, but of course there is this worry if he says something, people might say, `OK, he just came to meddle, said Burmese analyst Khin Zaw Win, a former political prisoner. So, I think a lot of diplomacy is needed, in addition to the public relations.Upon his arrival in Yangon, the pope was greeted by local Catholic officials and his motorcade passed by thousands of Myanmars Catholics, who lined the roads, wearing traditional attire and playing music.Children greeted him as he drove in a simple blue sedan, chanting Viva il papa! (Long live the pope) and waving small plastic Myanmar and Holy See flags. Posters wishing Francis a heartiest of welcome lined the route into town.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Hell finish the trip in France, where hell give one of several speeches planned during the trip.The tour continues a longstanding tradition of former US presidents traveling overseas after leaving office, especially as they work to attract donations and other support for their foundations, libraries and presidential centers.But Obamas trip may garner particular attention, given that many foreign countries are still uncertain about Trumps foreign policy and may look to his predecessor to help explain Americas current direction.Barack Obama is the great explainer to the rest of the world of what the heck is going on in America, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University.

Throughout his presidency, Obama often used the popular events in foreign countries to take questions about everything from politics and policy to his personal story and pop culture. Obamas office said roughly 280 young leaders planned to attend.Obama will give a final speech Saturday in Paris before returning to the United States. Aides didnt rule out the possibility that he could also see President Emmanuel Macron, whose presidential campaign Obama endorsed, while in France.Aides to the former president declined to say who was paying for the trip, but hell be compensated for the speeches.The trip comes as Trump is aggressively pushing Chinas leaders to cut off North Korea economically over its nuclear weapons program.Obama will also be in India just days after Trumps daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump.

Being billed as an alternate digital currency, cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of new units.Bitcoin, the first of these cryptocurrencies, over the Thanksgiving weekend has seen a major surge with a single unit being traded at more than $10,000. I know this is something that is being monitored by our team here, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters at her daily news conference.The IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said cryptocurrencies, including ICOs; including the initial claim offerings, should be subject to appropriate regulation and supervision. A key challenge for country authorities will be to contain risks without stifling the innovation associated with cryptocurrencies, he told reporters in response to a question.Cryptocurrency: The bits of BitcoinWe also believe that greater international discussion and, indeed, cooperation would be helpful, and as you may have noted, we, the IMF, have been trying to play a role in that regard, he said.

(Source: ThinkStock Images) A recent excavation has unearthed evidence of wine-making in two neolithic villages of Georgia dating back to 6,000 BC. (Source: ThinkStock Images)Little do we realise while taking a sip of our favourite wine that the story of its evolution is longer than most civilisations, languages, religions and cultures. The history of wine-making goes back much longer than what we knew till recently. Archaeologists have found the oldest evidence of wine-making during excavations in Georgia and South Caucasus. The unearthed relics were in the form of clay pottery with telltale traces of chemicals associated with wine. The relics date back to around 6,000 BC. The discovery means that it is possible the earliest wine-making was being done possibly half a millennium before what we previously thought.Prior to this discovery, oldest evidence of wine making was found in 1968 in the jars dating back at least 7,000 years ago. Six vessels found in northern Irans Zagros mountains were laced with traces of chemical identifiers of the drink.Wine became central to western civilisation over the millennia in forms of medicine, social lubricant and tradable commodity. When we pick up a glass of wine and put it to our lips and taste it, we are recapitulating that history that goes back at least 8,000 years, said Patrick McGovern, a co-author of the study from the University of Pennsylvania museum of archaeology and anthropology. McGovern was also part of the team that made the 1968 discovery in Iran.A team of botanists and archaeologists in Georgia collaborated in the project with researchers from Europe and North America for the exploration of two villages in the South Caucasus region, about 50 km south of the capital Tbilisi. During the exploration, researchers were met with a distinct cultural stamp of the neolithic period with the villages dotted with circular mud-brick houses, tools made from stone, signs of cultivating grains like wheat, barley as well as farming cattle and pigs.The fired clay pottery was of maximum interest for researchers. This is considered to be some of the earliest to have been made in the Near East. One of the jars was around 3-4 ft tall and nearly the same in width. The decorations with blobs, according to the researchers, could be marking for grapes indicating the use of the jars for purposes like pressing, fermenting, storing or serving.The team spread out to nearby areas in the region to find out to what extent was winemaking a part of life and analyses fragments of pottery collected from two neolithic villages. They also collected and analysed soil sample to help in radiocarbon dating. The total samples examined include 30 pottery fragments and soil samples. The dating of grains and charcoal puts the origin of the pots around 6,000 BC-5,800 BC.(A) Representative early Neolithic jar from Khramis Didi-Gora (B) Jar base SG-16a, interior and cross-section.

Note the textile impression on the base. (D) Jar base GG-IV-50, interior. (Photo source: PNAS)A host of analysis techniques was employed to trace what the soil and pottery fragments had to reveal. The results were published in the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences. According to the paper, eight fragments including two unearthed previously had traces of tartaric acid. This acid is characteristically found in large quantities of grapes. Associated soil analysed showed much lower levels of the acid. Three other acids that are associated with wine and grapes were found in the samples.Also, the team found ancient pollen of grape plant at the excavation site. Though the same was not found in the top soil. They also found grape startch particles, fruit fly remains and also cells possibly from the grapevine surface on the inside of one fragment.The team noted that it was very much possible that the vessels could have been used to store grapes but said that the shape of the vessels were such that makes them ideal for storing liquids and that grapes or raisins would degrade without leaving a trace. They also didnt find any signs of the pots being used for preparing syrups. Grape juice, on the other hand, ferments within days.The research findings indicate that the excavation site could well be home to the earliest vintners. Although wine-making remnants have been found at the Jiahu site in Chinas Henan province, they were found to be an amalgam of grape, hawthorn, rice beer and honey mead. The evidence in Georgia is, hence, the oldest ever to be found of a pure grape wine, said researchers.Furthermore, the narrow base of the pots makes it difficult to stand up which also suggests possibility that they couldve been half-buried in the soil while making wine. This was common practice in Iran and found in the Iranian vessels as well. It is quite possible the same technique was being used centuries ago in Georgia.The National Wine Agency of Georgia sponsored the exploration for the teams. Stephen Batiuk, co-author of the study and an archaeologist from University of Toronto, said: The Georgians are absolutely ecstatic. They have been saying for years that they have a very long history of wine-making and so were really cementing that position.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
