The committee, called Krishak Samriddhi Aayog, headed by the chief minister and with the agriculture minister as vice-chairperson, has been mandated to meet its objectives by 2022.The Uttar Pradesh government has constituted a committee to help draft and implement plans to double farmers income through increased crop production and other related means. The committee, called Krishak Samriddhi Aayog, headed by the chief minister and with the agriculture minister as vice-chairperson, has been mandated to meet its objectives by 2022.Other members include a member of Niti Aayog, UP Chief Secretary, Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC), Dr US Singh of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) of Philippines, Prof Sushil Kumar of IIM-Lucknow and nine farmers from the state who have been successful in farming particular crops.According to the order issued regarding the constitution of the commission, the Aayog will focus on 15 points, including assessing strengths and weaknesses in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and sericulture, and also to give suggestion in drafting of policies for sustainable and equal agriculture development.Speaking to The Indian Express, Chief Secretary Rajiv Kumar informed, This aayog is for policy guidance and implementation monitoring and collection of feedback through eminent farmers. He also said that CM wants policy for doubling the income of the farmers with the help of suitable suggestions.Another important task for the commission will include giving suggestion for procuring more production at reduced cost. Aayog will also suggest for strengthening the system for storage and marketing of crops. The body will also analyse factors responsible for decline in the income in the sector. It will also discuss on cooperative farming, contract farming, collective farming and corporate farming and to accordingly suggest for efficiency and cost effectiveness in the farming.The nine eminent farmers included as farmers representatives in the commission belong to Barabanki, Banda, Varanasi, Muzaffarnagar, Lakhimpur Kheri, Mahoba, Deoria and Azamgarh districts. These farmers have been selected on ground of their having expertise in production of potato, banana, tomato, sugarcane, worm compost, animal husbandry, organic farming, floriculture, poultry and fisheries.Sources said that names of these farmers were sought from concerned departments. There are nominees from concerned big companies as well who would suggest the measures for better marketing and production with low cost.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb57a69855b73f522c8f6b,Locked out  without a GI tag,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/locked-out-without-a-gi-tag/article20946377.ece,2017-11-27,"The law of Geographical Indications (GIs) is linked to terroir, that is the quality of a product is essentially attributable to the territory where the product originates. GIs support local production and are an important economic tool for the uplift of rural and tribal communities. Unlike other Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) which guarantee the protection of individual interest, GI is a collective right. If their products qualify, producers can use the collective GI mark while commercially exploiting their products.Path to introductionIndia implemented a sui generis legislation on GI in 1999, a prime reason being its obligation to have a law on GI as a member of the World Trade Organisation-Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS).The politics behind the incorporation of GI in TRIPS is revealing. The United States was not a supporter of GI, and it was lobbying by the European Union (EU) that ensured its inclusion in TRIPS. The EU already had its domestic mechanisms in place to protect GIs and was keen to protect its products in international markets.Interestingly, the debate on GI in India has never gone beyond Article 23 of TRIPS, which gives a preference to wines and spirits over other goods. Scholars in India have always observed that the additional protection of wines and spirits is a huge setback for GI trade related to the developing countries whose GIs are largely related to agricultural and handicraft products. The protection given to wines and spirits is absolute and unqualified, and unlike right holders of other goods, the proprietor of GI relating to wines and spirits does not have to prove that incorrect use of the geographic origin is misleading as well.Shortcomings in Indian ActAs India has failed over the years to introspect on its own domestic legislation, it is important to highlight the shortcomings of the Indian GI Act. It is important to note that TRIPS only provides a minimum standard of protection. Nowhere is there an insistence on a particular framework for protection of GI. In fact, TRIPS does not even mandate a sui generis mode of protection for GI.Against this backdrop, proof of origin is a mandatory criterion for registering GIs in India. This provision is borrowed from the EUs regulations on GI protection. What is cause for concern is not proof of origin as a criterion to register GI, but the focus on historical proof in the form of documentary evidence (such as gazetteers, published documents, news articles, advertisement materials) to bring out the historical development of GIs as laid down under GI Rules, 2002, and clarified by the GI Manual of the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, and Registrar of Geographical Indications to establish proof of origin. The point here is about the rationale behind including such a provision in our law as there was no mandate under TRIPS to do so.Documentary evidence as proof of origin may be a foolproof mechanism to ensure the link between the product and territory, but in a country such as India where there are regions like the Northeast where oral history is cited besides written history, this provision will prove to be a formidable hurdle.The case of AssamAssam has been exploring its natural, agricultural and traditional products as potential GI material. One such example is a traditional rice wine called Judima which is made by the Dimasa tribe of Dima Hasao, one of the autonomous hill districts of Assam. The State government has been tracking academic discourse on the subject with the intent of exploring possibilities in registering it. But a stumbling block has been the difficulty in gathering documentary evidence as proof of origin. It is the same case with many other products from the Northeast. For example, in the case of Judima, the word Ju stands for drink and Dima for Dimasas, but the absence of any documentary proof makes the case a difficult one to prove.Therefore, what is the rationality behind including and retaining such provisions in the law? For most products, especially those of tribal communities, this is bound to be a recurrent problem. A few years ago, India faced difficulties in a patent case involving turmeric when two scientists of the University of Mississippi Medical Centre, were granted the U.S. patent for the use of turmeric for wound healing. Indias Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which opposed this, was asked by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to submit documentary evidence of usage of turmeric for healing purposes in India in order to revoke the patent. On finding the existing documentary evidence insufficient, CSIR was compelled to launch a project of translating ancient Sanskrit texts which were later produced as evidence, and accepted.So, what happens in cases where written history is rare? Do the products of the region then not stand a chance under the GI law? In a particular instance, the GI Registry considered etymology in establishing proof of origin. However, this does not guarantee that a similar stance will be adopted while considering other potential GI products, especially when the existing law leans heavily on documentary proof. The GI authorities should amend the existing provision.Jupi Gogoi is Assistant Professor, the Indian Law Institute, New Delhi."

Cash crunch, which followed note ban last year, is no longer there, but rice millers buying paddy are still handing out cheques against farmers' produce.This is to avoid complications on the income tax front. Their financial advisers are asking them to not withdraw more than Rs2 lakh cash in one go. From April this year, cash transactions over Rs2 lakh have been made subject to penalty. Even as this relates to a single transaction made to a single person, millers are avoiding cash dealings fearing the action. The limit is also not applicable on bank withdrawals.In paddy season, large amount of cash is needed to pay the farmers. Millers are still paying the amount in cheque. Farmers, on the other hand, are wary of accepting cheques.""Cheques don't make a favourable proposition for many farmers, especially this year when crop is low. Farmers don't want a cheque because many would strighyaway lose the amount soon after it is deposited in the bank. A number of farmers have overdue loans. Bankers would simply adjust the amount deposited through the cheque against the loan. It would leave hardly anything in farmers' hands. This is the major reason why cheques are not being accepted,"" say millers.Millers or their agents are only sparing small amounts in cash paying rest in chequeThe paddy growers are facing an unprecedented crisis as pest attack has taken a major toll on the crop. Farmers claim that not more than 35% of the crop could be salvaged.""As much as 90% of our dealings have traditionally been in cash but since last two years cheques are being used. Chartered accountants have advised us against drawing more than Rs2 lakh in cash. The amount runs into tens of lakhs during paddy purchase season,"" said Sharad Urade, a rice mill owner at Brahmpuri Taluka of Chandrapur district.""The operations have shrunk to a quarter of the normal level this year as pests have destroyed a large amount of the crop,"" he said.""Farmers especially the older generation are reluctant to accept cheques. If they have a loan default the amount is adjusted against the dues. To avoid deductions many are asking cheques in the name of their children. Even in that case there are fears that their children may not share the amount,"" said Naresh Urade also a rice miller at Bhandara.Dinesh Bhoyar a farmer from Karachkheda village in Bhandara says he had been insisting that millser should pay in cash, even if the payment is done in piecemeal. ""Cheques have their own hassles, the money takes 15 days or so to reach the account,"" said Bhoyar.Deepak Hazare who sold paddy for Rs75,000 said even he was given a cheque too. ""Maybe it was because the amount is higher. But I have heard even others are being paid only in cheque,"" said Hazare. Although he does not have any overdue loan to be adjusted again.""Banks do adjust such desposists against overdues, but instructions can be issued against it, as the government would soon clear the dues through loan waiver scheme,"" said Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), a state government agency."

He also interacted with farmers and distributed farm implements.According to Madurai agricultural department, machine planting provides better yield and reduces the seed price to farmers as letter seeds are utilised. Weed growth in paddy field is also minimal when machine planting is undertaken. Joint director of agriculture, A Selvapandi said that 500 hectares are to be covered under machine planting in samba paddy season which is currently under way from Peranai to Kallanthiri area, after water was released from the Vaigai dam on November 1.Agriculture department estimates 36,700 hectares will be covered in samba paddy season and transplanting has been completed in 5,780 hectares already. Machine planting will be useful to complete planting swiftly since the season has delayed more than two months.The department also expects that nearly 20,000 hectares out of target area will be covered under system of rice intensification (SRI) method. Machine planting is one component of SRI, which is a methodology of using multiple components to increase the yield of rice in paddy. The method uses less water and labour in paddy farming. ""When we use SRI, the yield is at least 15 bags more per acre of paddy field. Regular yield is 47 bags,"" quipped A N M Thiruppathi, a progressive farmer from Kulamangalam village in Madurai West Block.Progressive farmers Dharmaraj and Arumugasamy have been transplanting 18-days-old seedlings in their paddy fields using machines and collector tried his hands in one of the equipment and machine planted paddy seedlings.After the water was released from the dam, more than 100 acres of lands are under paddy cultivation in Kalikappan and Karupayurani villages in Madurai East block."

Cooking! Mendy, who has also had a successful stint with Indian football clubs, Chennaiyin FC and East Bengal FC , says he loves cooking for his family. He was in the city on Tuesday to try his hands at making dosas and poori as a part of a promotional event. And before he entered the kitchen to prove his prowess with the spices, we caught up for a quick chat even as he kept slipping in and out for impromptu selfie sessions with football players and fans.""I don't know what I am going to cook today, but I am definitely here for some cooking fun. It is going to be a surprise for me as well to see what has been planned for me. It's the second time that I am cooking here  I did a round of cooking last year as well, for the same eating joint, but at a different location. The food I will cook is for the people who are visiting the restaurant for lunch, so all the best to them,"" laughs Mendy.He finds Indian food as spicy as African food and says, ""Like Africans, Indians, too, eat a lot of spicy food. So, I feel it's quite similar. Since I have been in Chennai for long durations, I have eaten almost everything that's available here. But I personally prefer non-spicy food. Anything non-spicy, say the varieties of dosas, rotis and naans, biryani, chicken tikka... I love to eat them all."" Back home, Mendy loves to cook for his wife and two daughters, and he also believes that men should share house work, and other chores about the house. ""Why should only women have to cook all the time? We men, too, can take part in household chores  that doesn't make any of us less of a man, or interrupt what we do, right? I am not a good cook, but I love to try my hands at making omelettes with ham cheese, pasta, and rice for my wife and two daughters.""A while ago, the internet was abuzz with rumours of how Mendy has quit football to take up a career as a professional poker player. But Mendy dismisses it even before you finish the sentence  he waves the question away, says not one bit of it is true. ""I didn't quit football at all, neither did I choose to play poker fulltime. Poker is hobby, just like how I sometimes play basketball. Poker is almost similar to football  where you must know if the other person is bluffing or not. This helps one understand the strategy and that's a skill which we develop as we play continuously. But I never left football for poker, I am still playing football,"" he avers.Ask him what brings him to the city, and Mendy says he is here to cheer the team. ""I am also here to discuss an important decision  that of me becoming the ambassador of Chennaiyin FC  it will be announced soon,"" he reveals. So, the Chennai team lost the first match to FC Goa recently... ""I think the second half was much better than the first and I also believe they are coming back stronger.

""It is the government's duty to provide her adequate protection to her,"" he reasoned.""Similarly, we will not accept lt governor issuing directions (to the officials) on the spot without consulting chief minister and the ministers concerned,"" he said.Speaker V Vaithilingam while endorsing chief minister's views regretted that Bedi has been visiting places without conducting a proper survey of the locations and issues related to the residents. Congress MLA T Jayamoorthy accused Bedi of returning files on welfare projects submitted by the government without any valid reason and declared that he was ready to stage a fast unto death before Raj Nivas to condemn her attitude.Earlier, Narayanasamy announced that the government will waive off the loans availed by the farmers from the cooperative institutions. He said the lt governor returned the file seeking the waiver of farm loans from cooperative institutions. He said she insisted on waiving off the interest alone and converting the loans into midterm or long-term loans and enable farmers to avail further loans. She also suggested adopting the Union government's policy in waiving off interests from nationalized banks too.He said the Puducherry government insisted on waiving of farm loans from cooperative institutions and claimed that it will compensate the institutions by repaying the loans with interest in five years. Bedi referred the issue to the Union government as there was no consensus between the government and the administrator. The Union home ministry accorded approval for waiving of loans from cooperative institutions but declared that it will not extend any financial assistance, he said.The opposition parties - All India NR Congress and AIADMK - walked out of the assembly to register their protest against the Congress government as soon as the session commenced in the morning. The opposition parties demanded the government to submit a white paper on the financial situation of Puducherry as the Union territory has been facing severe financial crunch. They charged that the ruling party miserably failed in fulfilling its poll promises. AIADMK MLAs led by legislature party leader A Anbalagan reached the assembly carrying trays with eggs, rice and cloth materials to condemn the government for failing to provide rice and clothes to the ration cardholders as promised.The assembly also passed an amendment to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Puducherry Amendment) Bill, 2017 to enable the conduct of jallikattu without any hurdles in future.Police have promulgated prohibitory orders from Wednesday for a week to prevent any untoward incident in the Puducherry region. Three BJP functionaries whose nomination to the legislative assembly has been challenged by the Congress government before the Madras High Court preferred to stay away from the proceedings."

5aeb65649855b73f522c9528,Of silks and sweets: Is GI tag worth the fight?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/of-silks-sweets-is-gi-tag-worth-the-fight/articleshow/61760526.cms,2017-11-23,"Rasgulla originated in Odisha, says researcher The state government on Wednesday started examining a 150-page report submitted by a researcher providing documentary evidences showing that rasgulla originated in Odisha.Should civilisations, now fragmented by boundaries on linguistic lines, fight over trivialities like rasogolla to cement their monopoly over such heritage? While the intelligentsia stood mute witness when people of West Bengal and Odisha made a mountain of a sweet last week, there were sane voices dubbing it a useless fight.""It is 'Banglar rasogolla', and not rasogolla, which has been GI-tagged in favour of a West Bengal government agency. Odisha, which never filed its objections before the Geographical Indications (GI) registry in the first place, can apply for its own unique Odishara rasogolla,"" said advocate and IPR attorney P Sanjai Gandhi, who wrote to the Odisha chief minister about the option.So, why so much fuss about GI and is it worth the fight? India is full of unique agricultural, handicraft, handloom and food items  both natural and manufactured  which are worthy of being given a special status. This would enable people making or growing the products to exploit them commercially. The very objective of GI tagging is to identify unique characteristics of a product, trace its territorial significance and give it a statutory protection, so that no bogus goods flood the market and tarnish the reputation of centuries.Tamil Nadu is home to 22 GI-tagged products which includes Kancheepuram silk, said Sanjai Gandhi, who applied and got the recognition for the handloom product. Pointing out that GI tag is not for 'silk' per se, he said arni silk and Salem white silk too got their own GI tagging. Rasogolla, therefore, could take the 'silk route' to avoid confrontation and peaceful co-existence.Of course, the issue of GI-tagging basmati rice is now mired in a massive litigation before the GI Registry and courts because a few districts of Madhya Pradesh were not considered. It could mean a big loss to Madhya Pradesh, unless it is either clubbed with other Basmati-growing areas of central India, or it manages to have its own GI-tagged Basmati brand.Real threats to the nation's artistic, cultural and culinary legacy may come from other nations. A brewing conflict between India and Bangladesh over GI tag for 'khadi' is a fine example. While Chennai-based Intellectual Property Rights Attorneys Association (IPRAA) has sought GI status for khadi, on behalf of all 29 states in India, Bangladesh has also submitted a similar application.IPRAA has now written to Bangladesh to withdraw its application because khadi is a quintessential handloom legacy of India. ""Instead of quibbling among ourselves, we must be alert to stave off threats from across the border,"" said Sanjai Gandhi, president of IPRAA, adding that the Indian government has done little to prevent exploitation and false claim over 'khadar' in foreign countries. Even Basmati is being branded by private parties and marketed in many countries, but India has not yet filed formal revocation applications in those countries to prevent their misuse.Ideally, India should be sitting on hundreds of GI tags for its products by now. But the total GI-tagged products in the country are only about 200. While Karnataka leads the bunch with 34 GI products, it is followed by Maharashtra (26) and Odisha (23). The fourth slot is jointly held by Tamil Nadu and Kerala, with 22 GI products each. There will be a dramatic increase in Tamil Nadu's tally in coming months, as it has filed applications for 29 different products. They are pending before the GI registry, and products that are likely to get GI-tagged by middle of next year include Manamadurai ghatam (mud pot-drum), Tuticorin macarons, Kovilpatti groundnut mittai and rice garland of Thanjavur.GI is a crown of thorn, too. Once an association or society earns it, judiciously exploiting it even while guarding it against misuse is tough. Darjeeling tea and its authorised users are examples. Users of the brand are alert against misuse and they have filed revocation petitions in several countries to safeguard the uniqueness of the tea. It has had a telling effect on the fortunes of tea-growers of Darjeeling, as they alone are reaping the benefits of their product.That is the idea. GI regime is designed to help genuine makers of products go laughing all the way to the bank, without compromising on the quality of the product. GI holds out no empty threat to violators. In case of GI infringement or false claim, there is a fine of Rs50,000 to Rs2 lakh, and jail term from six months to three years."

Yeddyurappa was the Chief Minister, he had signed a Memorandum of Understanding [MoU] with us to set up a pit head thermal power production plant in Chhattisgarh. We have enough reserves of coal, land and water. We were willing to provide them to Karnataka for power production. If the MoU was implemented, it would have provided enough power to Karnataka. But Karnataka could not benefit from it. As soon as he came to power, Mr. Siddaramaiah cancelled the project, Mr. Singh said here on Monday while speaking at Nava Karnataka Nirmana Parivarthana Yatre at Shahapur in Belagavi.Karnatakas Congress government was the most corrupt in the country, he said. Centre for Media Studies has concluded after a study that Karnataka tops the list of States with highest corruption, he said. Corruption is a traditional practice among Congressmen.

Once the Bill was passed, it would be sent for Presidential assent, a source in the government said.The session would see the introduction of Puducherry Court-Fees and Suits Valuation (Amendment Bill), 2017. The Bill would make way for introduction of a provision to buy judicial stamp paper online.Mandatory sessionThe Cabinet, which met under Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on November 9, had decided to convene the House as the constitutional mandate of conducting it at least once as six months will lapse in December.The session would re-convene at 10.45 a.m. The session in all likelihood would be held for a day or two but Opposition parties  the All India N.R.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu is facing allegations of constructing illegal check-dams to divert the PAP waters. Without the required storage at Aliyar, the rice growers of Chittur taluk will not be able to keep the second crop safe during December and January. The storage in the Aliyar dam is just 1.6 tmcft. It is estimated that the Parambikulam dam and its feeders Peruvarippallam and Thunakadavu have a combined water storage of 5.5 tmcft.As per the normal procedure, 3 tmcft must be released to the Aliyar dam from Parambikulam and the other two storages during November to store and for release to the Chitturpuzha, a tributary of the Bharathapuzha, as and when required.Farmers say they are in need of at least 2 tmcft of water by the beginning of December to support the crop.According to Muthalamthode Mani, Deseeya Karshaka Samajam leader, Tamil Nadu had constructed two check-dams violating the PAP accord in the Pallar and Nallar, feeders of the dams in the network, to divert water due for Kerala. Two more check-dams are under construction in the Nallar violating the accord, he alleges.Check-damsAs per the PAP accord, Kerala must get an annual share of 7.25 tmcft from Aliyar. According to farmers leader K.A. Prabhakaran, the State government has done nothing to prevent Tamil Nadu from constructing the check-dams though farmers in the region brought the issue to the focus of Ministers and top officials in Thiruvananthapuram.Local MLA K. Krishnankutty says he is in constant touch with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Ministers Mathew T. Thomas and A.K. Balan to ensure dedicated supply of the PAP waters to the Chiitur farmers during the second crop season.Meanwhile, farmers collectives at Cheerayankad and Olassery warn that they will resort to an intense agitation in the absence of government intervention.We will block movement of vehicles from Tamil Nadu and would not allow inter-State cargo movement unless our legitimate demand gets met, warns S.

Over the last one year, 200 hectares of wetlands in four districts have been restored for integrated farming, in the first phase of a Centrally sponsored project to build resilience to climate change and enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.The Rs. 25-crore project taken up by the Agency for Development of Aquaculture (ADAK) under the Department of Fisheries seeks to restore and manage a total of 600 hectares of coastal wetlands for carbon sequestration and production of paddy and fish.These include 300 hectares of Pokkali wetlands in Thrissur, Ernakulam, and Alappuzha districts and 300 hectares of Kaipad wetlands in Kannur. It is the only project in Kerala to have been approved for assistance from the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC).The rotation of rice farming and fish aquaculture is expected to provide more income for farmers and local communities, improve land use efficiency, and minimise land degradation.The four-year project involves the construction of earthen bunds along the margin of rivers and backwaters and along the periphery of paddy polders to withstand sea level rise, floods, and tidal surges triggered by global warming and climate change. Sluice gates are provided to regulate the water level and facilitate fish farming while biofencing would protect the bunds from damage due to heavy rain and flooding.Of the Rs. 5.9 crore sanctioned for the first year, we have spent Rs. 5.42 crore on restoring 200 hectares in the four districts, said R. Sandhya, Director, ADAK. Since paddy farming, unlike aquaculture, is not remunerative, it took some effort to convince farmers about the need for crop rotation. Over time, they have realised the merits of the integrated farming system, Ms. Sandhya said.She said the Agriculture Department had chipped in with timely supply of paddy seeds for the farmers. We are confident of getting the full tranche of assistance for the second year, she said.The NABARD-monitored project estimates an annual production of 1,500 tonnes of paddy and 2,250 tonnes of fish from the 600 hectares of coastal intertidal wetlands, generating a total revenue of Rs. 24.75 crore. It would also generate 1,08,000 man days of employment every year, of which 43,200 would be for women.Rs. 25-crore project has been taken up by Agency for Development of Aquaculture"

In 2016-17, the area brought under DRS method was a mere 1,100 hectares. But during the current year, a large number of farmers chose to adopt the DRS method in over 10,000 hectares raising the hopes of the officials that the area would further increase during the next season.I could save a minimum of 25 % per acre on the cost of cultivation under DRS method compared to transplantation method on the use of pesticide, application of fertilizer, few labour and also on reduced water utilisation, while getting a bumper crop, Keshav Reddy, who cultivated paddy in about 16 acres of land in Banapur village under DRS method, told The Hindu .To motivate other farmers to adopt DRS method, the Department of Agriculture organised a field demonstration day on Keshav Reddys fields and the turnout of farmers from the surrounding villages to personally see the bumper crop which was ready for harvest was huge. Our target was to bring 10,000 hectares under DRS method and we could exceed the target with more number of farmers showing positive response. We hope that more number of farmers would adopt DRS method and harvest bumper crop besides saving a lot on input cost and also water, Sharnappa Mudgal, Joint Director of Agriculture, said.K.V.

He should know, considering he has successfully beaten Extremely Drug Resistant (XDR) TB with a nutrient- and protein-rich diet regimen, and tested negative for the disease for four months now.Among XDR-TB patients, Mr. Sonagekar is a rarity: the strain of the disease he contracted had rendered him resistant to 12 of the 13 available anti-TB drugs. I relive my experience with TB patients in OPD. I tell them my story and make them believe in the benefits of immunity. I know this is what doctors have been always saying, but when I tell patients about the turnaround in my fight with the disease, I feel it definitely leaves an impact on some patients, if not all.His confident demeanour belies the life-changing experience he has been through, starting with a seemingly innocuous cough in December 2014. Nevertheless, he went in for a sputum test and an x-ray. The results were mixed: while the sputum tested negative, the x-ray revealed a lesion in his left lung, enough for doctors to diagnose his ailment as TB.Downward spiralDoctors immediately started Mr. Songekar on first line anti-TB drugs, but three months later, his cough had worsened and had begun coughing out blood. This time, the sputum sample tested positive. Worried, he decided to travel to Mumbai in April 2015 and get a expert opinion at the TB Hospital in Sewri.At the Sewri hospital, tests confirmed his worst fear: he had XDR-TB, which explained why the cough had worsened despite the medication. A CT scan revealed that the TB bacteria had made a cavity in his lung. Reports of tests carried out at the same time on his sputum samples at the Hinduja Hospital in Mahim came two-and-a-half months with the grim revelation that he had developed resistance to 12 of 13 available anti-TB drugs. This left only Clofazimine as a treatment option. I was suicidal. It didnt hit me at first, but when the Sewri TB Hospital report revealed drug resistance, I broke down, says Mr. Sonagekar.A lifelineAs he struggled against the onrush of acute depression, he met the Dr. Lalitkumar Anande, Chief Medical Officer at the Sewri TB Hospital. His advice charted the future of his battle against TB: shift all focus to his diet to boost the bodys natural immunity. I charted a diet plan and decided to leave for Savarde Patankar village in Kolhapur, where my parents stay. My hospital in Parbhani had given me leave, and I was worried Id infect my daughter and wife.It wasnt easy, parting from his infant daughter and his wife, Megha, who also worked as a nurse in the same hospital. Fortunately for the Sonagekars, he was being paid his salary despite being on long leave, which helped him afford the special diet. By then, he had lost five kilos, coming down to a rather lean 55 kg.It was only for my daughters sake that I mustered will to fight the disease.Food, the healerAccording to Dr. Anande, he needed a large amount of proteins, micronutrient-rich goats milk, honey, lemon juice and food supplements for vitamins A, B, C, D and E and a good amount of sunlight, which is also the best source of Vitamin D.Mr. Sonagekar began the daily diet from May 2015: mornings and evenings, he would consume four raw eggs, two litres of goat or cow milk, depending on availability and mixed with protein supplements, four bananas and a fruit juice. For lunch and dinner, he ate regular, wholesome homecooked meals of dal, chapati, vegetables, rice and salad. I would also have two lemons after each meal; Id simply suck out the juice instead of mixing it with water. The medication would make me feel nauseated, and Id often bring up the food, but I would force it down again.By the time the Hinduja Hospital culture reports came in July 2015, Mr. Sonagekar had already started putting on weight. While his medication was altered to include the one drug he was sensitive to, his diet continued. In January 2016, seven months after he began his diet, his sputum sample tested negative for the first time. After that, all tests were negative for TB. The lung cavity, too, was found to have reduced considerably.While he continues with the diet, Mr. Sonagekar was declared as cured of TB in July 2017, and doctors said he could stop taking his medication.I rejoined work on July 20, as soon as the medication stopped. My experience has left me equipped to pass on what Ive learned about the disease and how to fight it, he says.Dr. Anande, the man who charted his recovery course, says, This is a classic case study that proves how the immune system has the capacity to fight the disease. All one has to do is give it a boost by eating the right foods and getting plenty of morning sunlight."

Turns out, about 56,000 quintals (56 lakh kg) of wheat has been left to rot in various warehouses across the state over the last couple of years.Just to give you an idea of what that means: According to National Sample Survey 2011-12, an average rural Indian consumes about 4.3 kg of wheat in a month. This means, the grain being wasted now could feed at least 13 lakh individuals for a month.The huge pile of rotting wheat in almost all districts has caught the government off-guard, and it is now clueless, not only on how to ascertain quality, but also on how best it can dispose of the rotting wheat.An estimation by thehas revealed that 55,999 quintal of wheat is rotting away in the departments warehouses. The department has sought reports from all districts on the quality of wheat and whether it is fit for human consumption after being stored for so long.The department has also ordered a high-level inquiry to find out why such a huge pile up of wheat was not brought to the governments notice earlier.Sources in the Food and Civil Supplies Department told Bangalore Mirror that the government had initially announced that it would give 3 kg rice per person along with 2 kg wheat. During that time, it was receiving about 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat from the Centre for distribution under the Public Distribution System (), annually.As the government chose to distribute 5 kg rice undersubsequently, which has now been increased to 7 kg per person, the distribution of wheat was completely stopped, resulting in the huge pile-up, a senior official from the department said.Food and Civil Supplies Minister UT Khader told Bangalore Mirror they are finding ways to dispose of this huge quantity of wheat. Considering our supply of 2.5 lakh tonnes, the present pile up of about 56,000 quintal is only a small amount. We are trying our best to clear the stock. First, we will verify whether it is fit for human consumption. All the districts have been ordered to get their stock tested at the food laboratories for quality. Once we get the quality reports, we will decide whether it can be distributed to people or used to feed animals, Khader said.Officials of the department explained to Bangalore Mirror that regular fumigation was taken up at these warehouses to prevent degradation of the grains.Generally, the food grains are stored in a scientific manner and the floor is covered with fine quality tarpaulin. If the district administration has failed to ensure these measures, then there are chances that the food grains are spoilt. We will conduct quality tests for wheat that was stored for a long time. If the results are negative, it will be given to animals. If the tests declare it unfit even for animals, then we may have to dispose it of in some other manner, an official attached with a warehouse insaid.So, though the government is clearing all its stock of salt, ragi, sugar, palm oil and green gram, only in the case of wheat, it has chosen to await the quality report from various district centres."

Ananda Kumar and his colleague R.M. Sundaram, CCMBs Ramesh Sonti, Vishnupriya and others on Monday.GI value of a food is determined by feeding 10 or more healthy people a portion of the food containing 50 grams of digestible (available) carbohydrate and then measuring the effect on their blood glucose levels over the next two hours.Consumption of food with low GI results in slow release of glucose into the bloodstream reducing the ill-effects of diabetes.Plus, ISM also has desirable attributes like better yield and fine grain type enhancing market potential and profit for farmers, they told a press conference.With financial support from National Agricultural Technology Project of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and CSIR800 program of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) work began in 1999 and completed in 2006, it was validated in 10 different locations for two years across the country.

It is already been grown in 1.50 lakh hectares last year in seven rice breeding states including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, TS, TN, UP, etc., the scientists said. Farmers in several rice growing States have testified to the improved yield of up to 40% because of successful tackling of Bacteria Blight. In two/three years time, the scientists are confident of coming out with a new variety of rice which can not only give high yields but also be resistant to three different pests affecting rice crop with field trials currently on.CCMB Director Rakesh Kumar Misra said ISM development was an excellent example of inter-institutional collaboration. Two firms have expressed interest in commercial production of the seed and scientists expect more farmers to take to it in the coming years."

The Financial Management System (FMS) allowed all employees to have a look at the account details at their own convenience.Each enforcement team comprising a tehsildar, DCTO or ACTO , an inspector under an SP rank officer worked wonders in identifying Benami ration dealers and they were booked under PD Act.""The Online Procurement Management System allowed the department to handle a huge amount of Rs 8,067.43 crore get deposited with just one click in the accounts of farmers via online transfer this year. I liked this scheme a lot,"" CV Anand said."

The forum termed the move discriminatory and said the government has not explained why it has chosen not to give the gift to the card holders.In the letter, the forum said the government announced free Pongal gift to all card holdersaround 1.84 crore peopleincluding, Sri Lankan refugees, But, not for nearly 10 lakh citizens of Tamil Nadu , who are holding ration cards with sugar option, which is discriminatory, biased and unfair.The Pongal gift pack contains one kg each rice and sugar, a 2ft piece of sugarcane, 20g cashew nuts, 20g raisins and 5g cardamom.The forum went on to add that multi-millionaires, senior bureaucrats, class-I officials, industrialists and ministers were eligible for all freebies and Pongal gifts as they hold rice ration cards. We are not blaming them since they did nothing wrong as per the government norms. Unfortunately, many poor people, who preferred sugar card for various reasons in 1997 are ineligible for all freebies announced by the government, the letter added.The forums secretary K Kathirmathiyon told TOI that in 1997, people had the choice to select the type of card they wanted. About 10 lakh people opted for the sugar card. This also included people such as small tea and sweet shop owners. They opted for sugar card as they needed sugar for their business. Such people are being discriminated against. Also, the government has not explained the reason for not providing Pongal gift to sugar card holders. I wrote a letter to the Centre about the discriminatory attitude three months ago and the Centre had directed the state government to provide an explanation. But, there has been none so far, he said.The forum said it did not encourage freebie schemes. But, if at all freebies are to be given, it should be for the needy and poor, the letter said.When such schemes are done under a universal system, one section of people should not be discriminated against, Kathirmathiyon said. If it is a targeted system, then it is fine to give freebies only to a section of people. But, there is no basis for keeping out sugar card holders, as the cards were not given based on financial status or age, he added.According to the state civil supplies website, there are 10,76,552 sugar card holders in Tamil Nadu."

Skipping dinner and choosing to stick to just snacks is also a no-no. Avoid rotis and rice and limit your alcohol consumption to less than 100ml for a healthy start to the new year, they say.According to Debashish Saha , consultant, AMRI Hospital , green salad, non-oily snacks and non-greasy meat are perfect for having a blast on December 31 without weighing your system down. The tendency is to consume oily snacks like kebabs, fish fingers and cheese balls along with alcohol. It kills your appetite, making you skip dinner. That results in indigestion and hangover. Rather, one should pick salad or fruits if they are available. In case they are not, limit your alcohol consumption and make sure to have your dinner sans carbohydrates, said Saha.It could be a challenge to restrict alcohol consumption at a New Years party, so make sure you have the right kind of stuff to limit the negative effects, says microbiologist Irfaan Akhtar. It is important to know your limits. While its important not to consume alcohol on an empty stomach, dont stuff yourself with food either. Dry snacks and non-spicy dishes should be chosen. Diabetics and cardiac patients should avoid whisky and opt for red wine instead. It is important to go slow on starters since one often ends up having too much protein in a short span of time. This could affect the kidneys, said Akhtar.However, more than the food or drink, it is often hand hygiene that leaves party-hoppers sick the next morning, points out Arindam Biswas, consultant, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.Biswas added that some myths about preventing hangovers needed to be busted. Cheese or lime water doesnt help. In fact, it could lead to severe indigestion the next morning. Rather, take peanuts, lettuce, cabbage leaves, tomatoes and cucumber. Make sure to have plenty of water the next morning and you should be ready to swing into action, he says."
5b161eb49855b75db2e75741,Millets made a grand comeback on our menus,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/millets-made-a-grand-comeback-on-our-menus/articleshow/62298256.cms,2017-12-30,"Once upon a time, Telanganas staple food was much like its terrain  hardy, earthy, and robust with flavour. Were talking about the many millets that were the staple diet of Telanganites  jonna, sajja, korra, saamai, kuthiraivali, panivaragu and varagu, apart from makka cholam. Thats what people ate, apart from hand-pounded unpolished rice, which was reserved for special occasions. This was before the now infamous and cringed-upon white rice became common place. over the decades, the mass farming of rice changed not just the eating habits of the people of this land, but also their health parameters.But thankfully, thats changing. Whether its due to the nutritional value of millets, the rising need for gluten-free alternatives or even just the desire to go back to ones roots  millets are coming back into everyday diet majorly. And the many food trends that emerged in 2017 proved that humble millets are here to stay. Heres a quick recap.The year saw the emergence of string of restaurants in the city, all boasting of millet-based menus. Take for instance the popular Ahobilum, which serve a range of items made using millets, be it for breakfast or lunch and dinner, or even fancy get-togethers. We serve ragi dosa, millet dosa, multimillet dosa, millet idli and jowar roti for breakfast. For lunch we have, millet thali, ragi sangati, fried rice, biryani and then for dinner we have tiffin, jowar roti and multi millet roti. For those with sweet tooth we have arranged Korra sweets, made of foxtail millet, says, Vastav Pothuri, of Ahobilam Foods. Recalling the days when he startedthe restaurant two-and-a-half years ago, he adds, People didnt know much about the health benefits of millets and we had to put up information boards all around our restaurant. But now having realised its health benefits people are back to millets and how.Then you have a host of ready-to-eat millet snacks that have repackaged the humble grains, making them a lot more accessible and appealing. Our range called Kiru features healthy millet snacks in the form of cookies, sticks and health bars, says, Siddharth Sarkar, of Orgtree, a local manufacturer of millet snacks. They are free of preservatives, emulsifiers, additives and are rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Theyre healthy as they have lesser calories, are gluten free, diary free and have zero trans fats, he adds. While people are making the switch, marketing of millets need to be reinforced, says, Padma Koppula, Co-Founder of Aranya Agricultural Alternatives.According to nutritionist Mayuri Aavula millets are superior to rice and wheat by all of the nutritional parameters. Finger millet has three times more calcium than rice while every other millet has at least twice the amount of calcium compared to rice. While most of us seek a micronutrient such as beta-carotene in pharmaceutical pills and capsules, millets offer it in abundant amounts, says, Mayuri. rice ironically has zero quantity of this precious nutrient. Therefore, it is extraordinarily superior to rice and wheat in all possible comparisons, and is a solution to micronutrient deficiency that affects a vast majority of Indian population, she adds.Madhulika Arutla, Chief-Clinical Nutritionist, Asian Institute of Gastroenterology concurs, Millets are a great source of fiber and B Vitamins, as they are not refined like wheat or rice. These B vitamins regulate the metabolism in our body and are mainly utilised for energy metabolism and they control our nervous system as they enhance the antioxidant activity in the body.Include millets in your diet at least twice or thrice a week. people who dont like the taste of millets can mix a variety of millets in whole wheat flour so that the nutritive value can be enhanced. Deficiency ofB Vitamins can cause impaired sensations, impaired movements, reflexes in the arms and legs, mental confusion, muscle tenderness, loss of appetite and constipation,"" says, Madhulika Aratula, Nutrition Expert""Lack of B Vitamins can also lead to many nutritional deficiencies and deficiency of fiber in diet can cause constipation. So its very important to include millets in your diet. Take millets as part of your daily menu to reap health benefits as well as to prevent diseases like diabetes, hypertension and cancer. A simple way to include millets in your diet would be by consuming raagi porridge, raagi puttu, raagi idli, raagi roti, food items made of multigrain atta with wheat and millets, jowar upma and jowar idli can be included in your diet as breakfast. Foxtail millet (Korralu) can be used in place of rice or can be mixed into rice in 1:1 ratio before cooking. Wheat rotis can be replaced with Jowar rotis,"" Janaki B, NutritionistRagi flour: 1 cup, ghee:  cup, grated jaggery : 3/4 cup, roasted white sesame seeds:  cup, nuts (cashew, groundnuts,almonds) as required to garnishHeat a saucepan on medium flame. add flour and roast on low flame for 10 minutes.

This would help in curbing the pollution emission to a significant extent by utilising the straw as raw material, which currently is being burnt by the farmers resulting in air pollution.An state government official said that the project would also help reduce the effort farmers had to undertake for the burning process as the oil company would set up extensive infrastructure for speedy collection of straws so that farmers would not miss out on a crop cycle. Moreover, it would also add on to the farmers income as they would be offered a reasonable price for the straw. The project will also generate direct and indirect employment."

About five lakh farmers, mostly small and marginal, are expected to benefit from improved tank irrigation systems.Tamil Nadu, being a water-stressed state, continues to experience shortages which are expected to further exacerbate in the future. Rehabilitating and modernising irrigation tanks will improve the reliability and availability of irrigation water for farming communities, making them less prone toclimatic hazards. More than 1.6 lakh hectares of currently partially irrigated land will come into full irrigation under this project, said Union economic affairs joint secretary Sameer Kumar Khare The project is likely to rehabilitate and modernise about 4,800 irrigation tanks and 477 check dams, spread across 66 sub-basins, in delivering bulk water to irrigation systems. The project will help Tamil Nadu scale up efforts to unlock the full potential of agriculture sector. It will support farmers improve the efficiency of water used in farming, diversify into high value crops, and produce crops that are resilient to the increasing threats of climate change, said World Bank acting country director John Blomquist said.The fundswillbeutilised as part of a comprehensive project involving agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, agricultural marketing and other allied sectors. This will help water from rivers, tanks and wells reach remote areas, said a senior state agriculture official.Paddy is the dominant crop occupying 34% of total cropped areas, whereas fruits and vegetables are grown on 11% and pulses and oilseeds on 14% of the areas. By helping farmers access modern technologies, linking them to markets, and providing postharvest management support, the project will enable them to shift from a mono crop paddy system to mixed cropping including high-value crops (fruits, vegetables, and spices), pulses, oilseeds, and millets, said the official.The project will support smallholder producers adopt new conservation technologies such as the system of rice intensification (SRI) and sustainable sugar initiative (SSI). They reduce average water usage by 35% and increase yields by 22% per hectare. The project is expected to increase the yield of rice, maize, and pulses by 1820%."

In Kerala, many people, including the small holders, have acquired land as an asset and not as a productive unit, Harilal points out.As per a rough estimate more than 1.5 lakh hectares of cultivable is remaining fallow in Kerala, said Prof Mohandas, former director the college of banking and cooperation of the Kerala Agriculture University.Agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar said developing entrepreneurship and promoting value addition of agriculture produces can make major contribution to lure younger generation to agriculture and to revive growth in the sector.""Youngsters may not be keen to directly enter farming activities, but they can be ready to start agro-processing units using modern technologies. This will ensure steady demand and price for agri-produces which in turn would encourage more people to return to farming,"" the minister said.He pointed out that currently less than 5% of the agriculture produce is being value-added in Kerala, whereas in the developed regions the share is as high as 70%.

5b22405c9855b7429b3172d7,"Outside Green Park Metro, a tale of two food kiosks",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/outside-green-park-metro-a-tale-of-two-food-kiosks/articleshow/62259398.cms,2017-12-27,"NEW DELHI: Outside the Green Park Metro station hangs a tale of two kiosks. On Tuesday, the dusty yellow Jan Aahaar kiosk of the Delhi government is shut. On the other side of the road, the fresh green kiosk is open and has a swarm of eager customers gorging on a plate of rajma-chawal for Rs 10. The subsidised meal is part of a new scheme, Atal Jan Aahaar Yojana , launched by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation The rice is without kankar (grit) and the rajma is neither oily nor spicy. The green chilly is free of charge. Its decent value for money -- thats the verdict of a bunch of customers. The food is clean and tasty. There should be more such kiosks across Delhi, says Kishen Singh, who works at a gas agency. Security guard Ram Lal too relished the meal. He used to be a regular at the yellow Jan Aahaar kiosk. That kiosk, he says and others affirm, hasnt opened for weeks. I have been eating at a dhaba where four rotis, sabzi and daal cost Rs 40. This stall is a godsend for people like me who earn only Rs 9,000 per month, he says.Providing low-cost meals, primarily for the citys teeming underclass, has been on the menu of political parties across ideologies. The Congress Sheila Dikshit government had started the Jan Aahaar scheme in 2010. By next year, reports say, the scheme had about 40 stalls across the capital. This January, the current AAP govt had also set up a subsidised canteen at LNJP hospital. On Monday, the BJP-majority SDMC opened six lunch kiosks. Christmas Day coincides with the birthday of the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The new scheme is named after him.Auto driver Dalip Singh chanced upon the green kiosk, which strangely has no signboards claiming ownership, after dropping off a passenger at the Metro. I used to eat at the yellow Jan Aahaar kiosk where they initially charged Rs 15 and gave puris, chawal and sabzi. Then they raised the price to Rs 18. Over the years, the quality of food went down. This meal was good and it is reasonably priced. I only hope that the quality doesnt dip, he said.On Monday, when SDMC launched the scheme, halwa and puri had also been served along with rice and chhole. But DS Rawat, the man behind the counter, says the halwa was only part of the inaugural celebration. But we plan to serve puris too, he says. The menu will change every day, he said. Chhole-chawal, daal-chawal, puri-sabzi  any one of them could be on the menu tomorrow.The new kiosk is open between 11 am to 2 pm. By 12.15, Rawat had already served over 125 customers and the number is rising fast by the minute. He had brought four cans; each filled with 25 kgs of cooked rice. Rawat hopes that they will be empty before it is time close. Even in times of Swachh Bharat, there are no dustbins around and the used thermocol plates pile up behind the kiosk. We will get a dustbin soon, he says.Not everyone is happy. Kallu Kashyap, who has been selling food from the same spot for the past 20 years, is sullen. He sells kachoris, chhole-kulche and paranthe-chawal  each of them for Rs 20 per plate and he is losing the pricing game. By now, Kallu says, he would have sold about Rs 500 worth of food. Today I have only sold a few kachoris. May be business will improve after 2 pm when the kiosks shuts, he wonders. You might have to find a new place, someone suggests. Let me see. May be I will sell something else, he is not sure.About a kilometer away, a Jan Aahaar kiosk of the older variety is doing brisk business outside Safdarjang hospital. Customers, mostly those attending to patients, are wolfing down hot puris, sabji and daal. Six puris come for Rs 18, seven for Rs 20. You have a rice option too, though none seem to be opting for it. Customers such as Anil Yadav, whose relative has been undergoing treatment for the past three months, says the food is satisfactory though Anil Jaiswal from Azamgarh insists the daal is watery.However, the largest queues, resembling scenes outside ATMs during the early days of demonetisation, are at the two bhandaras, free kitchens, near the hospital. Everyone in the queue got two samosas each with aloo ki sabzi. The other one, organised by Lakshmi Narayan Foundation , had a healthier option which included bananas. Together, they combined to cause a mini-traffic jam."

It was a lot of money for a daily wage earner who did not earn more than Rs 13,000 in a month. Whats more, he could have afforded better treatment for his ailing two-year-old daughter. He could have taken leave from work to be by her side during her hospital trips, something he cannot afford to do as a daily wage earner.Had he wanted, he could have just kept quiet when he realised that a customer had paid Rs 74,000 extra over the bill amount. But he ignored all temptations and ensured the money reached its rightful owner. Ashwin (33), a driver with Infibeam Logistics that delivers orders for Fortune Online, had recently gone to deliver two 25 kg rice bags and five tin cans of sunflower oil to a customer in Paldi who had ordered it online.The total bill for the order was Rs 12,184. But the woman customer was busy with some work related to her daughter. She handed over a bag containing the amount that she had set aside beforehand. At the same time, I received a call from my wife asking me to rush to Sola Civil Hospital as our daughter was not in a good shape. I quickly counted the bundles of notes, put them in the car boot and rushed to make three more deliveries.After making the last delivery in Bapunagar, I rushed home in Chandlodia. Ashwins daughter, who has been suffering from nutritional issues and refusing food, is currently undergoing 14-day treatment at Sola Civil. She needs to go to the hospital every day for two weeks for the treatment under which she is provided food as per her nutritional requirement.When I reached home, my daughter had returned. My sister who lives with us told me she was better and sleeping, said Ashwin, who is the sole bread winner of the family of eight. His daughter is being treated under the Matru Vatsalya scheme by the government for the economically weaker sections.As per his daily practice, Ashwin handed over the bag of money to father Narayan Talwadi (63) to count. We have the application document that has details of goods delivered and the bill amount. My father asked me about the amount I had collected. To my surprise, he told me that the bag had additional Rs 74,000. Both of us separately counted the money again to make sure there was no mistake in the counting, he said. Recalling the incident, Ashwin said, I realised that instead of bundles of Rs 10 and Rs 20, I had been given five bundles of 100 and six bundles of 50. I had the remaining Rs 6,184 in my pocket. Ashwin immediately called up his operations manager Miraj Upadhyay and apprised him of the situation.On his insistence, I counted the money again. He asked me to bring the money to our office in Satellite. In the meantime, he called up the customer and asked her if she was aware of the excessive payment she had made, said Ashwin. Upadhyay told me that the customer was not aware of her mistake. We went to her house and returned the extra money. She thanked me profusely, Ashwin added.The customer, who refused to be identified, said, I wasnt even aware that I had paid excess money. Only later did I realise the error. I never expect such honesty in todays times when integrity of even the honest can be put to test. Such people are difficult to find in todays times. I would have been at a huge loss had the company and the driver not drawn my attention to the mistake.She added that she could not thank them enough for their gesture We are proud of Ashwin Talwadi for demonstrating honesty and integrity. He set a high example for us to show importance of restoring customer trust while delivering service. We are truly thankful to him and we recognise his gesture, said Shekhar Singh of Infibeam Logistics. Ashwin will also be felicitated by the company in coming days."

Taking a cue from the popularity of Amma canteens in Tamil Nadu, civic bodies in the capital, too, rolled out half a dozen Atal Aahaar Kendra centres on Monday, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees birthday, which will dole out subsidised lunches at Rs 10 per thali.On Monday, six centres were launched in Okhla Mandi, Matiala chowk, Green Park/AIIMS, Raghubir Nagar, Kakraula Mor in Najafgarh and in Shalimar Bagh. North and South Corporations have announced that one such centre will be opened in every ward in a phased manner in the next one year while the East Corporation has put the scheme on hold due to its severe financial crunch, its standing committee chairman Parvesh Sharma said.The kiosks, which are of 9 feet by 5 feet in size, have been set up by the NGOs operating midday meal kitchens.They will remain open between noon and 2pm on all seven days. The centres will provide four puris or 250g rice with 150g sabzi in one of these combinations  chhole-chawal, rajma-chawal, puri-sabzi, dalchawal, puri-chhole. We expect to get around 500-700 plates every day and the civic body has assured that they will provide Rs 4-5 per thali financial assistance in the later phase.

Expansion will be done in phases  initially each zone chairman will set up a kendra, then the 21 councillors who are special committee chairmen and finally each of the 104 councillors within the next one year and budgetary provision for the same will be made in the ongoing budget session.The cash-strapped north corporation hopes to raise the revenue for the project by giving operators advertisement rights though sources in the corporation said that theres a tiff within the corporation and the project has not yet been cleared by the House. Opposition members have argued that unless an open tender is carried out the project should not be passed.AAP, too, had promised to open Aam Aadmi canteens but the project has failed to materialise. A similar proposal was mooted in 2014 by Satish Upadhyay but it could not be implemented. Corporation officials also have been reluctant to get into the business of providing food, especially when no such funds or provisions exist under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act."

The matter is being probed and the report will be sent to the education department for action.Both BSA and DIOS have been told to see that other schools do not follow the Hapur-like practice. The divisional education director warned that action will be taken against the errant schools.In a recent inspection conducted by the midday meal authorities, it has been found that there were various irregularities in the context of the food grains being prepared and hence financial irregularities too came into picture. In this backdrop, all of you are instructed to check that no other school is involved in any such irregularity in future and if any such case comes to the fore, then action will be taken against them, the divisional education director said in his order.The inspection in question was conducted at Rajputana Regiment Inter College in Hapur. According to the statistics maintained by the school authorities, all the 155 students here were given midday meals. As per norms, each child should be given 150 grams of grains  which means that 23.250 kg of rice should have been prepared. But on inquiring with the cooks, the officials found that only 4 kg of rice was prepared for the day. And the meagre amount was distributed among the 155 students. Despite this, the school authorities reported in their midday meal register that they had prepared 23.250 kg of grains, the inspection report had said.It was also found that despite the quantity of grains given was hardly one sixth of the actual prescribed quantity, the money for the same was being withdrawn from banks."

The winner of Grammy Awards for Best Global Music Album in February this year for Yo-Yo Ma and The Silk Road Ensemble had his schooling from St Xaviers High School, Patna (1975-1985) and graduated in English literature with gold medal from Banaras Hindu University. Talking to TOIs Faryal Rumi during his stay in Patna, Sandeep talked about his dream, passion and love for music. Excerpts:Share the best memory of your school days I have so many good memories of this school, like when I represented my school in NCC at the Republic Day camp and my principal Fr George Thana said my personality had changed for the good. I was only the second student to represent my school at the Republic Day camp. Also, I won the All India Music Competition three times in a row  1980 in Trivandrum, 1981 in Ahmedabad and 1982 in Chandigarh.How you got inclined towards tabla?There was actually a complaint by a teacher to my father that I was disturbing the class by tapping on the desk. When I was asked to stop, I started tapping my shoes on the floor. Instead of getting angry, my father bought me tabla. I was taken to my first guru Shiv Kumar Singh at seven years of age.If you were not a table player then what you would be Then I would probably be a golfer. I was also the school soccer team captain.How you see todays guru-shishya relationship?Our teachers were like our parents and always touched their feet because I have that kind of respect for my elders and teachers. If you tell your own kids to touch somebodys feet, they are shy. Thats the basic difference. I learnt tabla from Shiv Kumar Singh and then Pandit Kishan Maharaj in Banaras. I used to travel to Banaras to learn tabla every Saturday and come back to Patna by Sunday night. Later, my family shifted to Banaras so that I could continue learning tabla unhindered.Have you noticed any change in Patna?Patna was a city which had biggest and longest classical concerts. I still remember large congregations at Patna Collegiate, Boring Road and Gandhi Maidan for concerts. Now, people want their children to learn guitar or synthesiser, which cant get them respect in the world because it is not in your blood. Its not only Patna but everywhere. People are trying to mimic the West and that makes me very sad. No matter how much chopsticks, pizza and noodle you have, ultimately you want to have some rice and dal. Even now when we hear old music, we like it more.Did you try to make some innovations in your instrument?Thats the beauty of our musical instruments. People have tried to change it but the traditional sitar is still the best. Electrical sitar sounds like a guitar. I have not planned anything. Traditional instruments are the best. But I tried to incorporate new things to suit the peoples choice.Do you have any plans to move back to India?I dont see that happening. But I have an organization in Delhi called HUM- Harmony Universality through Music that supports six visually impaired kids. Our organization is being supported by a German company. They are trained under best gurus.Are you working on any new album?Im recording one called Road to Damascus with a Syrian oud player, Indian sarangi and sitar player. In another album, Im doing a duet with celesta player Mike Block. We hope it to be released by next year.Any message for the music lovers or young generation.I want to tell them  Pay attention to your own tradition. India is great and they should be proud that they are born in this country."

And the one who is armed with this highest knowledge, lacks nothing.Kapdi is the principal of the Shree Shankar Pathshala , Kavlem, run by Gomantak Sanskritottejak Mandal , the oldest training institute for purohits in Goa. Here knowledge is imparted on the Vedas, Shastra-Puranas, pourohitya, Sanskrit, literature, etc. The institute has produced over 500 purohits since inception in May 1930. Currently there are 49 students enrolled for various courses in this boarding school. The enrollment in this school is open for pupils from the Brahmin clan in the age group of 8 to 14 for various courses of durations ranging from7 to 12 years.The Shree Shankar Pathshala stands at the same spot it was originally built, a mud structure along the Ponda-Durbhat road near Don-khamb. A temple dedicated to Shree Shankaracharya stands beside it. The temple is among three such temples of the philosopher-sage existing in the country. The pathshala has been the alma mater of a number of accomplished Vedic scholars from Goa  Vidyadhar Shastri Upadhyay, Vitthal Shastri Marathe, Sadhale Shastri, Pendse Shastri, Haribhau Borkar Shastri, Krishna Kelkar Shastri, to name just a few.Following Goas liberation, Gomantak Sanskritottejak Mandal was duly registered under the Societys Act in 1964 and since then the institution has been relentlessly carrying out the task of studying and propagating the wisdom of ancient India and the Sanskrit language through the pathshala. The institute is affiliated to the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth, Pune, and Bhartiya Vidya Bhuvan, Mumbai.The aim of the pathshala, says chairman of the Mandal Arun Desai, is to impart training in conducting pourohitya in the best possible manner. Desai says it is significant to note that apart from Pune, this is the only school in entire south-western Maharashtra and Goa imparting Vedic knowledge.IAS officer and a former director of transport in the state government, Desai has initiated several reforms in the administrative set-up of the pathshala in keeping with changing times. For instance, at his behest, the daily menu for lunch now includes a vegetable dish in addition to rice and dal. Previously, the students were served just rice and dal, which resulted in many dropouts. Secondly, earlier inmates were required to smear the floor with cow dung as a routine practice as per the ancient Indian tradition. Desai stopped the practice in order to make life in the boarding school a slightly less arduous for the young students. His sustained efforts also led to the establishment of an examination centre in Goa for students appearing for exams conducted by Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth, Pune, and Bhartiya Vidya Bhuvan, Mumbai.To integrate purohit-students into the regular academic school system, the Mandal opened a high school in 2016 with an enrolment of 15 students.With financial assistance of a one-time grant awarded by the state government, the mandal has recently renovated the premises. A pictorial life history of Adi Shankaracharya now adorns the spacious dining room where students partake their meals sitting cross-legged on the floor. A hygienic kitchen where students take turns in preparing the meals, a well-endowed store room, and a library containing thousands of scholarly books have lent a touch of class to the ancient gurukul system of learning followed here.Speaking to STOI, Desai underscored the need for the government to support initiatives in the field of Vedic education and purohit training. As this is one such area which generates 100% self-employment, Desai said.Reassures Kapdi, As the shloka in the Upanishads says, the one who is equipped with this highest knowledge, lacks nothing. He alone is a true Brahmin  the protector and propagator of knowledge."

Certainly not when somebody tries to deprive him of his fertile land that feeds his joint family of 10.Mr. Subramanian, who has been fighting to hold on to his lush, eight-acre piece of land and prevent it from being taken on lease, has, in a way, been the man behind the mass protest against the Centres hydrocarbon exploration and extraction project at Neduvasal that has been raging for over a fortnight now.The sprightly farmer, who, as a young man, aspired to join the Army but was not allowed to do so by his parents, is celebrated as a hero by many in the village. But for him, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) would have already sunk an exploratory well in Neduvasal as it had done in half-a-dozen neighbouring hamlets.For the past four years, Mr. Subramanian has been stubbornly refusing to part with a portion of his land  about four acres  sought by the ONGC, which had zeroed-in on this exploratory location through seismic surveys conducted over the past several years.Although some of his neighbours had given their land on lease to the ONGC, much against his advice, Mr. Subramanian has been holding on to his four acres, as if for dear life. Articulate and well-informed, he recounts the attempts to take over his land on lease: On April 4, 2013, a group of officers, apparently from the ONGC and the Revenue Department, arrived and started taking measurements around my field. I was working in the field and wasnt bothered initially. But soon, they started fixing boundary stones. Taken aback, I rushed in, asking them what they were doing on my field without my consent. They said they were conducting a survey. I asked them whether they knew who the owner of the land was. Was I dead?After a bout of discussion, Mr. Subramanian politely told them to remove the boundary stones as it would be disrespectful to the officials if he himself were to do so.They complied with my request and left, narrates Mr. Subramanian.The day marked the beginning of a long fight. Ever since, it has been a torture as the officials kept coming at frequent intervals, asking us to hand over the land, says a frail-looking Parvathi, his wife. She underwent a mastectomy a few years ago, and the family spent nearly Rs. 5 lakh on her cancer treatment by raising loans.The family has already been through some troubled times. Apart from Parvathis poor health, the couples elder sons wife died, leaving two young children in their care and the younger son doesnt have a steady job. The land is my only source of income and I raise a range of crops to meet the expenses. As we cannot afford to hire labourers due to high wages, we ourselves toil in the field, he says.Though the visiting officials kept changing, their demand remained the same  sign on the dotted lines. They even called me for peace talks with senior officials at Tiruvarur. I went alone, ignoring my wifes advice. They tried to coerce me into signing the lease document. But I stood my ground, he recalls.They offered to hike the compensation but I said I will not give up the land even if they gave me Rs. 5 crore. They came calling even about six to seven months back, but I explained my position to them. Let them go to court, I will fight it out. They can take over my land, but only over our dead bodies, says Mr. Subramanian.Giving up landsAt neighbouring Karu Nallandarkollai, just two kilometres away, P. Kulandai Velar, aged over 70, sits on a bullock cart outside his tiled house, looking forlorn. He was one of those who had agreed to give their land to the ONGC without a murmur when they came asking for it in 2006.I, along with my brother, gave up six acres when they asked for the land, saying they were going to be drilling for kerosene. I didnt ask any questions then. They started work in 2007. They are still paying me Rs. 60,000 annually. I used to earn more growing paddy, sugarcane and banana using a borewell, he says.A potter by profession, he doesnt get much income from the trade these days. Both my wives died, unable to bear the fact that I had given away the land. I have sold many of my cattle, he claims.An exploratory well sunk by the ONGC in his field presents a stark danger to the villagers even though there has been no activity at the site for the past few years. A square-shaped ground level tank, about 100 metres away from the well, still has a substantial quantity of what looks like crude oil  apparently leakages from the well.The land is barren now and I have no hopes of restoring it to take up cultivation again, says Mr. Kulandai Velar.Protests gather massThe tale of the two farmers, and the likes of Mr. Kulandai Velar, who had given up his land for ONGCs exploratory wells, has stirred what has now grown into a mass protest, almost akin to the recent pro-jallikattu protest in the State. Much like the jallikattu protest, this stir intensified with the support of the youth and celebrities, mobilised through social media.On February 15, when news broke that Neduvasal was only one among the 31 contract areas of small fields where exploration of hydrocarbons is to be taken up across the country, many villagers rushed to meet Mr. Subramanian, asking him whether he had signed the lease document. Relieved to hear that he hadnt, the villagers got into a huddle and launched the protest the very next day.Ever since, the village square in front of the Nadimuthu Mariamman Temple and the adjacent temple tank have become the setting for the sit-in, which over the past couple of weeks has turned into a strident protest with the support of farmers organisations, environmental activists, youth mobilised through social media and political parties. It was not long before villagers of Karu Nallandarkollai and Kottaikadu, where the ONGC has already drilled exploratory wells, went on protests at their respective villages.Black flags in front of houses and hoardings decrying the hydrocarbon project greet visitors all across the villages. Hundreds of people keep pouring into Neduvasal every day, even as the police keep watch on all visitors. Vehicle numbers and mobile phone numbers are noted down. A section of young agitators have alleged that students are not being allowed to enter the village, but policemen deny the charge.The villagers are keen on ensuring that the protest does not take a political hue. While politicians are welcome, they are asked to conduct demonstrations near the bus stand, just behind the temple.Indeed, politicians have been heading to Neduvasal, like bees drawn to honey, or issuing statements in support of the agitation. The protests reached such a crescendo that Union Minister for State for Road Transport and Highways Pon. Radhakrishnan, who hails from Kanniyakumari, made an assurance recently in a speech he made in the delta region: The Centre will not go ahead with anything that would be harmful to the people of the State. Other major political parties joined cause with the farmers, though they had to keep their physical distance from the core protests.The villagers play eager hosts and are generous in their hospitality. Hundreds of people are fed daily by a community kitchen adjacent to the protest venue. Over 20 people, many of them women, cook the food. Variety rice is served to all, from 1 p.m. till six in the evening. The villagers contribute rice and vegetables voluntarily. We are happy to feed the people who support us. It is our culture. No one should go hungry. We want to ensure that our village is saved, says P. Poomalai, who is busy cutting vegetables in the kitchen. About 15-20 bags of rice are cooked every day by a team of men and women who begin work as early as 6 a.m.On Friday evening, the farmers of Kottaikadu, one of the two villages adjoining Neduvasal, where protests were being held against the hydrocarbon exploration project, called off their stir temporarily. They said the State government had assured them that it would address their two main demands: Complete closure of the well sunk by the ONGC in the village and the restoration of lands to the 11 persons who had given them on lease.A village transformedThe most striking feature of the landscape for anyone approaching Neduvasal is the almost abrupt change in topography  expanses of dry scrub jungles, cashew and eucalyptus groves en route to the village suddenly give way to refreshingly lush green fields of paddy, groundnut, vegetables and coconut groves. Gardens in front of large houses are full of jackfruit, mango and other trees.This is a place where we grow almost everything. Except apples and a few hill-grown vegetables, we grow everything we want, asserts C. Balakrishnan with pride.This indeed is the refrain of the farmers who are agitating against the project. Pudukkottai is normally considered a dry district. But we have toiled over the past 30 years to change it. Using borewells extensively, we have managed to change our landscape. The Cauvery Modernisation Project canal also runs along our village. Today, we raise three crops a year, including paddy, in addition to horticulture and floriculture. You will not find even a single piece of barren land here, says A.S. Thirugnanam, a member of the Save Neduvasal Campaign Committee.Villagers claim that no information has been provided to them on the project so far. They had sought to take some lands on lease a few years ago, saying they were drilling to extract kerosene. How can the ONGC offer our land to a private company without our consent? a villager wondered.The villagers are consumed by apprehensions about the exploration plans of the government  from the depletion of water table depriving them of their livelihood, to the contamination of fields and incursion of sea water in the water table. Some claim that the execution of the project would cause earthquakes and even make the local population more vulnerable to certain diseases.The villages youth believe that the project also involves extraction of methane and shale gas. The project is nothing but an attempt to tap methane, asserts R. Nirmala, a B.Sc. Microbiology student from Karu Nallandarkollai, who had skipped her classes to join the protest. Others see an ulterior motive. Their (the governments) ultimate objective is to mine lignite, claims G. Palanivel (38), who, after finishing a course in catering technology, had worked in Singapore for three years. He had returned recently to help his aged father in agriculture.We have already seen the dangers of the project as the site where the well was sunk has turned barren. Thats why we are protesting, says Sundar Mahesh from Karu Nallandarkollai.The villagers are not willing to buy the explanations of the ONGC or the government. They say it will not affect the environment. But how can they guarantee that? Some say we should make sacrifices for the countrys development. But we dont want to be martyrs. Our land is precious; we will not cede even a cent of land, maintains Mr. Thirugnanam."

No prizes for guessing it is idli and dosa, the all-time south Indian favourites.Their popularity is evident from the number of times technologies pertaining to them were downloaded from among the 11 developed by the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), and made available free of cost to entrepreneurs.Traditional foods are driving the food industry and their market is expanding. Idli and dosa will remain much-loved among them, says CFTRIs Director Ram Rajashekaran.""Our ready-to-use idli (1,800 downloads) and dosa (1,900 downloads) technologies saw the maximum number of downloads for adoption by entrepreneurs, which shows a promising future for traditional foods despite the onslaught of junk foods, Mr. Rajashekaran felt.Other technologies made available for free by CFTRI include amla candy, composite ragi bread, fruit spreads, protein-enriched buns, cereal rice flakes, and the refining of millets. Whereas the tech for protein enriched buns has crossed 1,400 downloads, the technology for cereal flakes rice has been downloaded about 500 times, and that for refining millets about 400 times.Thus far, 4,539 aspiring entrepreneurs from across the country have registered with CFTRI for availing their free technologies.Dr. Jeesa Krishna from Kerala is one of them. She is hoping to make it big with her food start-up on fresh idli and dosa batter, which is all set for a launch. Several enterprises, like hers, are either launching or have commenced production with free technologies from CFTRI.I appeal to entrepreneurs and start-ups who adopt this technology to blend the batter with fibre. Fibrous foods are good for diabetics. Also, keep you products safe and free from preservatives, since they delay fermentation. Since everybody likes these foods, I would like entrepreneurs to look beyond the product and incorporate nutritional benefits, the CFTRI director suggested."

According to its vice-president and president in-charge Anilraj D.M. the outlets have been planned in Mangaluru, Surathkal and Udupi. They are likely to be opened within two months.The federation (like milk union) which came into being last year, has 44 organic growers associations (like milk societies) under its ambit with about 4,500 members. It is one among the 14 regional federations in the State. Farmers whose land has been chosen for organic certification should not use chemicals for three years. Karnataka State Organic Certification Agency is inspecting and certifying the farm land.Such farmers got the final certificate after three years of inspection. If their certificate was to be renewed they should seek inspection every year as its validity would be for only one year. Now its members are in the third year of inspection and certification.Mr. Anilraj said that the produce of farmer members, who have obtained In Continuation II certificates after two years of inspection from the agency, would be sold in those outlets.There will be exchange of produce among other organic federations in the State. Hence all organically grown produces should be made available to consumers.He said that the federation has been moving its millets and rice through an organic marketing agency in Chikkamagaluru since six months on trial basis.Mr. Anilraj said that now space for the three organic outlets in the coast was being finalised.Meanwhile, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts have 11 and six associations of growers, respectively.

Nedunchezian, founder CEO and social entrepreneur, Technocrats India College Finder, Chennai, here on Thursday.Speaking at the second day of the four-day skill development programme organised by the Department of Education for its officers, he said that in this age of transformation, plenty of changes were happening outside the classroom and beyond the scope of school curriculum. Only if the teachers kept track of those developments, they could incorporate them while teaching.Not all students passing out of a school were aware of the wide choice of college courses. Beyond medicine or engineering, there were many interesting programmes offered by various universities and colleges, with scope for employment. After Plus Two, a student could take at least 80 entrance examinations.Teachers should be aware of those programmes so that they could share the information with their students, Mr. Nedunchezian said and cited an example: Many children take just the curd rice and leave the buffet table.A good teacher should be able to guide them to taste the different varieties on offer, he said.Earlier, at the inaugural session on Wednesday, School Education Secretary T. Udayachandran said the State government was keen on giving a new meaning to school education from the ensuing academic year. There will be many changes to make our curriculum on a par with the best in the country. Teachers will be encouraged to think out of the box to help students shape their future, he said and appealed to the participants to think beyond marks.For instance, classrooms should transform. Instead of an autocratic behaviour, teachers should build a cordial relationship with their students, he said.Odisha governments Additional Secretary R. Balakrishnan, Collector K.

Experts say the trick lies in replacing cheesy pizzas, gooey chocolates and brownies with healthier options and handling exam-associated nervousness by following relaxation techniques and getting ample amount of sleep.Highlighting the importance of healthy bites, director of Psy Academy Counselling Service V. Harilakshmi says food plays an imperative role in beating the stress. Starting the day with a glass of lukewarm lemon water with honey will help flush out the toxins. Breakfast should be sans oily and spicy stuff accompanied by a piece of apple or a handful of sprouts. Long study hours lead to constant energy burnout. This should be substituted by a healthy platter, suggests Dr Harilakshmi.Health experts suggest millet-based khichdi , broken wheat upma and boiled eggs for breakfast. Lunch platter should consist of dal , vegetable curry and more of fibre-rich stuff along with rice. Boiled groundnuts, whole wheat bread sandwiches along with fruit juices or diluted buttermilk can be served as evening snack. Nutritionists recommend soups, chapathis and curry or curd rice as an ideal dinner menu.

Pictured above is a woman preparing to sow groundnut seeds in a field in Tiruvarur district; Below, a dry well at Siruganur village in Tiruchi district. Photo: B. Velankanni RajFor farmers of the delta region of Tamil Nadu, the biggest festival of the year is naturally the harvest festival  Pongal. For each farmer, it is like a wedding in the family  the preparations are joyous and go on for three days.Not this year, though. This year, Pongal was a dull, lacklustre affair in the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu. With the failure of both monsoons that wet the lands and enable water-intensive paddy planting process, and lack of Cauvery water, farmers have been traumatised. First, their short-term crop kuruvai failed, and then, the long-duration paddy crop of samba, just as the farmers feared. Faced with mounting debts, the inability to pay back and literally zero yield in some cases, farmers have been pushed to the brink. Pongal was no occasion to celebrate, at a time when the State is arguably witnessing its worst drought in recent times.Rani could not sleep for days after after her husband, V.Murugaiyyan, 48, committed suicide in November. The samba crop that he had planted on a three-acre piece of land he had leased out in Pirinjamoolai in Nagapattinam district had withered.I am an illiterate and have no land. We have nowhere else to go and all of a sudden, feel orphaned after my husband took his life, unable to bear the burden of debt any longer rues Rani. She has a 11-year-old child with mental retardation and a daughter studying in Plus Two to take care of.There are other such Ranis in the State, the government concedes to a far lesser number than farmers organisations and the opposition parties.While desperation drove many farmers to end their life, the stress put such pressure on many others that dozens died of cardiac arrest following the failure of crops in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts and in other parts of the State.We faced an unprecedented situation this year with the failure of both the South West and the North East Monsoons. Water from the Mettur dam was inadequate and the groundwater table in the delta has gone down badly, observes Mannargudi S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association.Just chaff, no grainThe Cauvery delta region mostly comprises the Grand Anicut aycut, perhaps the biggest and most important in the southern peninsular region. From Grand Anicut, the Cauvery irrigates 4.64 lakh acres, the Vennar 6.69 lakh acres and the Grand Anicut Canal 2.56 lakh acres. Tiruchi, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Pudukkottai, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and parts of Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu and Karaikal region of the Puducherry Union Territory form the core delta region irrigated by the rivers.Today, one can see vast stretches of seemingly barren land or left fallow, especially in Nagapattinam district, and also in the tail end areas of Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts. Incidentally, they are neither barren nor left fallow as the directly-sown paddy crop could not grow to maturity in time due to water scarcity and the failure of the North East Monsoon. Worse still, those who had raised paddy and saw the crops wither for want of water, let their cattle graze on them with a heavy heart.Despondency was apparent during Pongal, the harvest festival across the region this year. There was no Pongal for us this year, rues S.Natarajan (62) of Kuzhumani in Tiruchi, pointing to the banana trees that have suffered a stunted growth.It has been 45 days since his banana crop got a wetting from the Uyyakondan canal. We pleaded with the authorities desperately to release some water for an urgent wetting. The trees have not flowered now, he said. Last year, he had tried to sink bore wells twice, but failed.There are several others like him in the region between the Mettur dam and Upper Anicut in Tiruchi and whose fields in Namakkal, Erode, Karur and Tiruchi districts are served by 17 irrigation channels branching off from the Cauvery on either side of the banks. They could not irrigate their crops as the inflow into the Mettur dam could not meet the demands of even the priority core delta area farmers.Nothing left save thaliIn the wake of delays in primary agricultural cooperative societies advancing them credit, many farmers had taken loans from private money lenders at high interest rates to sustain their crop and now they are not in a position to repay them on time. I am left with just this thali after having pledged all my jewels with private pawn brokers in trying to save my paddy crop, admits Ilanjiam, a marginal farmer of S. Kannanur on the northwestern borders of Tiruchi district. Now that the crop has withered, I dont know when I will recover from this blow, she says.Many farmers in rain-fed regions of the State who launched agricultural operations after an initial burst of rainfall but were deceived as there was no more rain till the monsoon withdrew. They too are in a soup due to the failure of the North East Monsoon this year.The crisis is not restricted just to the Central region of the State. Murugesan, a marginal farmer in Sambakulam in Mudukulathur taluk of Ramanathapuram district had borrowed Rs. 20,000 for paddy cultivation and another Rs. 30,000 for chilli cultivation but lost both the crops. I am under severe stress. Every day, when I get up in the morning, I swear in the name of God I feel like ending my life, says he looking up at the skies. After losing the crops, he became a daily wage worker and is struggling to make ends meet, he says.Droughts are not uncommon to the farmers of this arid district but this year, many of them burnt their fingers after borrowing money from private money lenders in the absence of credit facilities in the Primary Agriculture Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) after the demonetisation drive.Water, cash crunchKarnataka brazenly braved all Supreme Court directives to discharge water in the Cauvery to save the standing crops in Tamil Nadu. The Central government turned a blind eye to it too. Prime Minister Narendra Modi demonetised high value currencies and restricted withdrawal limits compounding the crisis at the wrong time for the farmers who were then in dire need of funds for farm operations and most importantly disbursal of wages for labourers,'' observes Mr. Ranganathan.The denial of cash-giving kuruvai and the failure of the samba put paid to the hopes of the delta farmers. The short- term paddy crop used to give them the necessary wherewithal to help them raise the long-duration samba paddy crop in most of the delta region or in areas where bore wells could be used to irrigate the fields cultivate the thalady paddy crop.There is a misconception that the delta reaps three crops in a year and farmers are asking for more. That is definitely not the case. The predominantly clayey nature of the delta soil allows raising of only paddy during any time of the year. If assured water for irrigation is available, farmers raise kuruvai and thalady paddy crops with the help of sub surface water in restricted areas, while in most of the regions in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam district only samba paddy crop is being cultivated using water flowing down through Cauvery and its branches, besides the help from the heavens. Kuruvai as a seasonal paddy crop has remained a mirage since the Seventies.Despite the State Government announcing kuruvai and samba special packages carrying cash incentives, the farmers continue to suffer. I need to buy water for irrigating my withering samba paddy crop. Those who have bore well charge Rs. 100 to Rs. 150 per hour and one acre piece of land requires 10 hours of pumping to fully irrigate the area. For such four wettings, my entire return is taken away, observes a farmer S. Durairaj of Erukkattur village in Tiruvarur district.A Central team fanned out to various parts of the State to assess the drought impact. Ironically, parts of the delta region received moderate rain ahead of the Central teams visit, leaving farmers ruing their fate. The unseasonal rain over the past few days in Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur districts has raised apprehensions among farmers, who had raised paddy with the help of pump sets in some parts of the delta. The ryots fear that continued rains at this stage might flatten the fully matured paddy crop.The farmers are also upset with the mode of crop insurance scheme. Crop insurance in the present style is not indemnifying me against any crop loss as such. The mode of crop loss and damage assessment, compensation arrived at as also the time taken for disbursal of the compensation are awful and are in fact unfathomable to farmers. Even if we don't get to fix the price of our produce, we must at least know the damage-compensation mechanism, which must be transparent and farmer-friendly, says farmer T. Mathialagan of Paappanadu village in Thanjavur district.As agriculture took a beating this year, the situation of the landless farm workers seems far more complicated. At least, farmers have some lands to rely upon after overcoming the crises in the future. We don't have a today and we wont have a tomorrow, points out V. Jeevakumar, Thanjavur district vice-president of the Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Thozhilalar Sangam.The failure of the paddy crop is set to trigger a massive fodder crisis as well. In areas where sub surface water is being used for irrigating thalady paddy crop, production is expected to plummet sharply again, resulting in a huge loss for farmers despite the hard work. Excess dependence on sub surface water and overexploitation has resulted in depleting water table levels. Already a drinking water crisis looms large over the state. Unless the State government steps in with farm loan waivers and better crop insurance policies, the future seems bleak, say farmers. They pray for a reasonable monsoon the next year, and the strength to last until then."

She maintained that various varieties of rice were being provided to students. The Congress leader also suggested that millet-based food could be provided in the State-run budget canteens, Amma Unavagam.Soon enough, Mr. Kumar found a supporter in DMK member P. Geetha Jeevan (Thoothukudi), who sought to know from the Minister whether millets were part of the meals provided and if so, which were the millets.Eggs are being provided to students, Ms. Saroja said and went on to elaborate that eggs had more protein than millets and it was with the intention to provide sufficient protein to students that eggs were provided to them and contended there was no need to introduce millets in the noon-meals scheme.Congress legislator made a case for including millets to provide sufficient nutrition to students"

There are affordable people who by opting for rice and not sugar card have become eligible for the Pongal gifts. freebies. But, unfortunately, many poor people who opted for sugar card for one reason or another like tea stall or sweet stall owners have become ineligible for no fault of theirs. At the time of issue or renewal of the PDS cards, the Government offered a choice to consumers - to choose either rice or sugar card. There was no real distinction between rice and sugar card holders as the Government did not fix any eligibility criterion.

The recipe: source local, stay healthy, spare the environment.The wild foods and slow foods on show provided a glimpse of the culinary traditions of indigenous communities at the Keystone Foundation campus in Kotagiri on Monday. Tubers, legumes, yams, fruits and other forest-sourced produce were sliced and diced by participants from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, and activists from Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to work up the visitors appetite.Cuisine is closely linked to culture, and the festival was planned with the idea of reviving traditional, local diets and sustainable consumption practices among indigenous tribes and populations, said Pratim Roy, Founder-Director of Keystone Foundation.Local communities from the three southern States got to work on recipes that included sweets, salty snacks and other staples.Slow food, Mr. Pratim Roy said, is sourced locally, provides a fair price to producers and is sustainable. This is the guiding philosophy of locavores. Wild foods and the slow food movement have a common goal, which is mainly to get local communities and the general public to return to their older, more sustainable and healthy eating habits. They were urged to eat more locally grown vegetables and support such food.The movement provides the added environmental benefit of protecting biodiversity, as traditional practices of communities that harvest wild foods are closely linked to the ecological well-being of their habitats.K. Madhavi, an Irula woman from Achakarai in Masinagudi in the Nilgiris, says tubers were a staple diet of the community. Yet, their harvest from the forests was gradually on the decline.

Hence, from this day, good forces are on the rise and the power of evil forces which reside in the direction of South diminishes, said Pt Anand Shankar Vyas of Ujjain.Makar Sankranti is celebrated across the country with different names. While in the north it is celebrated as Lohri, in Assam as Bhogali Bihu and in the south as Pongal.But, for the last few years, the celebrations in Tamil Nadu had been mired in a political controversy over the Supreme Courts decision to ban Jallikattu, saying it causes torture to the animal.The ban has evoked strong reaction with even celebrities like Kamal Hassan and Rajnikanth opposing the ban saying one cannot curb tradition in name of animal welfare.Political parties in Tamil Nadu on Friday organised protests across the state against the apex courts refusal to pronounce a verdict before the Pongal festival on Saturday.The states opposition party DMK also accused the Centre and the AIADMK government of not taking appropriate, timely steps to ensure that the event was conducted.Jallikattu is our tradition, but the Centre and state government have failed to get us the permission to conduct it, said DMK leader MK Stalin. The Centre should bring an ordinance immediately, and the state should ensure that its followed.The four-day Pongal celebrations in Tamil Nadu began on Friday Bhogi, when people burn discarded items.Thai Pongal, which is the main day of festivities, will be celebrated on Saturday. Traditionally, Pongal is made in households across the state using freshly harvested rice grains. Maatu Pongal, the third day, is traditionally when Jallikattu events are held.Assam celebrates the mid-January Bhogali or Magh Bihu  a festival of feasting from Friday night -- with a difference.Officially, there will be no buffalo fight at Ahatguri in central Assam and bulbul bird fight at the Hayagrib-Madhab temple complex at Haju, west of Guwahati, in view of the Supreme Court ban, sources said it may be organised unofficially considering the sentiment of the locals attached.In Madha Pradesh, holy bath and pooja are witnessed on the bathing ghats of Narmada river at Amarkantak, Jabalpur, Omkareshwar, Hoshangabad and several other places.People also offer to the poor and needy food grains mainly rice, pulses and til (sesame seeds). Khichari and laddoos made of til are special dishes on the day.In north, where Lohri means start of harvest season in Punjab and Haryana, the dip in January temperature close to zero degree Celsius has dampened the spirits. Festivities have been organised for Friday night Lohri bonfire and cultural events. This year farmers expect a good winter crop because of above normal monsoon, a reason for cheer.In states such as Hayana and Rajasthan, Makar Sankranti is being celebrated to propagate girl child through campaigns such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and Hamara Garv, Hamari Betiyan. In Rajasthan, scholarships will be given to girls for school to college studies.Arrangements are being made for special prayers meetings and pujas to be held at city temples and gurudwaras to mark Makar Sakranti on January 14.Hindus from Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana go to Kurukshetras Brahmasarovar and Haridwar in Uttarakhand to take holy dip in Ganga.

The NGT directed the Manjha Association of India to submit a report to the Central Pollution Control Board on harmful effects of kite stringsSome kite sellers in Jaipur said desi manjha  cotton threads toughened by rice gluten  was being sold; others said synthetic and Chinese manjha were also available at outlets. Some buyers said even desi manjha was coated with glass powder.Serajuddin, who works in a jewellery industry in Johri Bazaar, said all types of manjha  desi or Chinese -- are dangerous and should be banned. Desi manjha can kill or injure birds, and Chinese manja can kill humans, he said.Manjha has killed two kids here. An acquaintance of mine was driving a scooter when Chinese manjha of a snapped kite got entangled in one of his ears; someone pulled it and half of his ear got severed, Serajuddin said. Even regular cotton string is dangerous for birds.A kite enthusiast argued that the government should not rob them of the fun of flying kites during Makar Sankranti, which, he said, is a major entertainment festival.Ban Diwali too because it causes pollution. Ban Holi too because the colours can cause cancer. Ban Eid-ul-Azha because animals are killed, said Jeetu Bhai, a businessman in the Walled City. But he supported ban on Chinese manjha, calling it dangerous for birds. But desi manjha hardly harms birds.Purshottam Agarwal, a cloth shop owner in the Walled City, hailed the ban on manjha, citing dangers to birds. Agreeing with him, another businessman said he has stopped his two kids from flying kites with manjha. I let them fly kites with sadda (cotton string). But sadly, all types of manjha are being sold. Government should strictly enforce the ban, said Rajender Jain.The NGT direction came after advocates Sanjay Hegde and advocate Shadan Farasat, appearing for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), sought the ban.They referred to the November 2015 order of the Allahabad High Court, which banned the use of Chinese manjha in Uttar Pradesh and sought a ban on manufacture, import, sale and use of these strings.The tribunal had earlier issued notices to the state governments and sought their response on the PETA plea."
5b256f0a9855b74f2e616092,"Puducherry: War between L-G Kiran Bedi, CM V Narayanasamy Threatens to Boil Over",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-war-between-l-g-kiran-bedi-cm-v-narayanasamy-threatens-to-boil-over/story-ht9bK5bWkqjR1Pg3bKidqM.html,2017-01-11,"A turf war has broken out in Puducherry, with the elected government pitting itself against Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Kiran Bedi. While tensions have been mounting for some time now, the suspension of a Puducherry civil services (PCS) officer for allegedly sending obscene videos on a WhatsApp group, created by the L-G for administrative efficiency, has now led to open hostility.On Friday, January 6, Congress MLAs wrote to the Union home ministry seeking intervention against the L-Gs undemocratic conduct. The elected officials were given scant respect, not even involved seriously in addressing local issues which are normally within the domain of the elected representatives of the constituencies (sic), the letter stated.This letter was sent directly after the L-G cancelled an order issued by Congress chief minister V Narayanasamy directing government officials to desist from using social media for official work. On January 5, Bedi announced on Twitter, If Puducherry has to be a progressive UT it cannot be retrograde in communications. Hence @CM_Puducherrys order stands cancelled.According to the original circular by Narayanasamy, who took over as the chief minister in June 2016, his order was in accordance with the Official Secrets Act and guidelines of the information technology ministry. Officers are required to obtain the chief secretarys permission to use social media for official work. As soon as the CMs order was issued, a number of WhatsApp groups administered by government officials to interact with the media were shut down.On January 7, Bedi wrote an open letter to the people of Puducherry and sent it to all media houses in the UT. According to her letter, she has decided to step down on May 29, 2018, when she completes two years in Puducherry. I am happy to support them [the elected state assembly] as long as the law is not in conflict with a central law. She spoke of the various complaints against her and explained that her approach was not to punish, but to help perform, inspire and support. I have spent all my mornings over the weekends on visiting problem areas to bring about solutions, and we succeeded, she wrote.She adds that there is a lack of balance between the urban and rural budgeting, which currently heavily favours urban amenities. I have exercised financial prudence and not allowed any diversion of funds. Despite this, I have had complaints of abuse, the letter said.She ends with a promise to leave Puducherry clean, safe and prosperous.This is the first of many open letters, she said and has pledged to write one every month.A video and its aftermathThe CMs circular was issued after AS Shivakumar, registrar of Cooperative Societies and a PCS officer, was suspended for sending an allegedly obscene video to the Prosperous Rural Puducherry group, administered by the Raj Niwas, the L-Gs office. A case was registered against the officer, and Bedi ordered his suspension. Shivakumar explained that he sent the obscene video by mistake while attempting to delete it. Despite an immediate apology, and representations from officials, the LG ordered his immediate suspension without following proper rules, a senior PCS officer alleged. According to him, the LG should have informed the chief secretary, and the order of suspension should have been issued from the latters office after due enquiry.Read: Puducherry govt wants me to be mere figurehead, says L-G Kiran BediA case was filed under section 67A of the information technology act dealing with transmission of obscene material over electronic media. Shivakumar was detained at the Orleanpet police station for over 15 hours without the case being filed.Though the police refused to comment on the detention, a senior police officer said that on the face of it, it looked like the video was sent by mistake. Within two minutes of sending the offensive video, the official apologised. However, we are investigating the case, he said.Bedis action in suspending Shivakumar has raised the hackles of government officers, who have rallied against her. The Election Commission stayed the suspension on January 4 stating that Shivakumar was appointed as an electoral roll officer. Its order said the L-G ought to have taken the commission into confidence and consulted before placing him under suspension.There have been persistent rumours of a rift between the CM and the L-G ever since they found themselves at the top posts within a month of each other mid-2016. In fact, within a couple of months, Narayanasamy made it a point to tell the media that things were cordial between them. Bedi, once a star in the Anna Hazare movement, switched to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the run-up to the Delhi assembly election early 2015.Though the CMs ban on social media came after the Shivakumars suspension, his ministers insist his order was to prevent the undemocratic use of social media. The Lieutenant Governor has been issuing a number of orders on WhatsApp groups directly to heads of departments, bypassing the secretaries in charge of these portfolios. According to the business rules of Puducherry, a minister is responsible for the actions of the various departments under his ministry; but in many cases, the minister was unaware of the orders that were coming from the L-G. This is undemocratic, grumbled a minister in the cabinet. While WhatsApp and other social media are useful for communication, official government work cannot be sanctioned through these apps, he added. Often, permission and orders have been issued through social media. Orders issued through the app cannot be used to release funds for work that needs to be done, and cannot be considered official.An unprecedented animosityThe events of the past few days have left the Union Territory in a state of shock. According to Rajasekhar, a veteran journalist, this sort of animosity between the elected government and the L-G is unprecedented. Never before has a chief minister issued an order based on observations, but even more surprising is a Lieutenant Governor declaring the CMs order null and void. The government officials and the elected representatives are rallying against the L-G, he said.According to the Rules of Business of the Union Territory of Puducherry, when there is a dispute between the L-G and the elected government, the matter must be referred to the Union home ministry, a government official clarified. It is unprecedented, and against these rules, for the LG to issue an order cancelling that of the elected government, he added.In the meanwhile, the opposition party, AIADMK, has called for the L-Gs removal and the suspension of the cabinet for six months. The new government and the L-G took charge within a few weeks of each other, and since then, it has been as if there are two parallel governments. Officials are in a state of confusion and there is no work getting done, despite promises and announcements by both the LG and the CM, AIADMK legislative party leader A Anbalagan told reporters last Friday.Government employees, too, are bemused. CH Balamohan, president of the Confederation of Pondicherry State Government Employees Association, pointed out that the administration cannot function with two parallel governments. The Lieutenant Governor has been meeting separately with heads of department and issuing orders for separate programs without the knowledge of the Secretary. Often the orders issued by the L-G are in opposition to the orders of the Secretaries, which has been causing confusion within the ranks, he said.Another sore point has been Bedis requirement from the time she assumed office last May that government officials report for duty on weekends, and often as early as 6am. The L-G often conducts inspections early in the morning and on weekends; but for a government official, this is an additional burden, Balamohan said.The CM made it clear where he stood when, after the cabinet meeting to discuss Shivakumars suspension, he told reporters that the decision to work on weekends was left to officials discretion.Files pending among warring factionsThe CMs colleagues have also taken up cudgels on his behalf. The Lieutenant Governor has repeatedly flouted rules in a number of matters, social welfare minister M Kandasamy said. He alleged that a number of files placed before the L-G for consideration by elected representatives have been ignored. Even in routine matters like the transfer of PCS officers and the dredging of the port to allow fishing, the papers have been lying on her desk for several months.Accusing the L-G of flouting rules, he alleged she had convened official meetings at the Raj Niwas even before her appointment was confirmed in May 2016. Even during the model code of conduct ahead of the by-elections where Narayanasamy contested for the Nellithope constituency, the L-G continued to issue orders to officials, he said. The Election Commission had issued her a warning in November about this.Politicians say that despite a flurry of announcements from the Raj Niwas, and periodic inspections by the L-G, there has been no progress in the Union Territory. A number of schemes proposed by the current government have been placed on hold, they allege. We had proposed that the old age pension should be distributed in the homes of the elderly by bank officials, but the L-G refused permission, K Lakshminarayanan, parliamentary secretary to the chief minister, said.Ditto a proposal to purchase rice from local vendors to allow the Union Territorys free rice scheme to continue. The State Trading Corporation was unable to supply the required rice, so the scheme has been stopped for the past two months. When we approached the L-G to allow us to buy from local suppliers, she refused permission, he said. Even a large chunk of the MLA Local Area Development funds has been kept aside to pay arrears on schemes announced in the previous regime, instead of allowing current MLAs to introduce new schemes for their constituencies.Elected representatives have an obligation towards their constituencies. Unless they are given appropriate funds and allowed to perform their duties, the electorate is bound to be disappointed in them, social welfare minister Kandasamy said. He pooh-poohed that several of the LGs activities were simply media stunts, and no real work was being done.Journalist Rajasekhar observed that every week the media follows the L-G on her inspections, and every week there was a new announcement. But so far, there does not seem to be much of a follow-up.Veteran CPI (M) leader T Murugan said Puducherry appeared to be in a limbo with no major schemes up and running. A number of schemes have been announced, including the cleaning of all canals, implementation of beat policing and announcement of the 1031 crime helpline. But there has very little progress on these fronts in the past six months, Murugan said.Bedi, though, has her fan club and a number of residents are happy with her. Purushotham, a senior citizen, showered praise on her approachability and the gusto with which she undertakes work. We can contact her through Twitter, or even visit her at the Raj Niwas to air our grievances. This is a first for us. But even after seven months, there does not seem to be much change in the Union Territory. This could be because there are few people willing to cooperate with her.While there has been a deafening silence from Narayanasamy, Bedi has taken to Twitter to have her say. When a leader wants things done he will promote shared info. When he wants control & dependence he will ensure they r kept divided/deprived, she tweeted last Friday.And, for good measure, I am not in Puducherry to do a job but transform the UT. Make it cleaner, safer, responsive public services, financial prudence & rule of law, she added.(Published in arrangement with GRIST Media)"

Clearly there is one outlier that needs to be addressed and that is China. As we move through all the other elements of the NSG membership, I think, were on a good path forward, Biswal said.Read: Why NSG membership matters to India: All you need to knowSo what remains is to be able to have a very clear understanding on what is the basis of Chinas reservations and to try to work through those. So that will be something that would move on to the next administration to carry forward, she said in response to a question.But this is something that the President himself has personally engaged on, the Secretary (of State), (National Security Advisor), Ambassador (Susan) Rice and down the line this has been an area of intense effort by this administration, Biswal said.While India not becoming a NSG member is disappointing, Biswal said the Obama Administration is very very gratified to see Indias entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).China is advocating a two-step non-discriminatory approach for admission of countries who have not signed nuclear-Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the NSG.As per the new stand announced by Beijing in November, it first wants to find a solution that is applicable to the admission of all non-NPT members followed by discussions to admit specific non-NPT member.Chinas stand for a non-discriminatory criteria is regarded significant as Pakistan, a close ally of Beijing too has applied for the NSG membership along with India."

They want us to move in with them but we want to stay here. Our parents never left this place; we won't either,"" Sushil, 15, a Class X student, told The Telegraph.At the single-storey home of the village's lone Pandit family, Sushil and his older siblings Meenakshi, 17, and Saroj, 16, are receiving guests, mostly their Muslim neighbours who are comforting them and reassuring them they are not alone.Their mother Baby, a diabetic with high blood pressure and aged around 40, died after a brief illness. Their father, who lacked a permanent job, died a year ago after falling ill.""Even when our father died, our relatives from Jammu had urged us to come and live with them, but mother said she would never leave this village,"" Sushil said.Sushil added: ""We rarely visit our relatives - everybody here treats us as their own.""After Koul's death, the neighbours and some Pandits from elsewhere in the Valley had lobbied with Sartaj Madni, vice-president of the ruling People's Democratic Party, and helped Baby find a job with the Jammu and Kashmir Bank.Meenakshi, a Class X dropout, said: ""We don't want to leave our home but we don't want to be dependent on others, either. We appeal to the government to provide us with jobs.""Thousands had joined Baby's funeral - many of the women were weeping - and she was cremated according to Hindu rites.""During her last moments, she urged us to take care of her children,"" said Naseema, a neighbour and Baby's friend who has breastfed all the four Pandit children. They call her ""boba"" (mother) and her husband ""daddy"".When Koul died last year, the village had pooled about Rs 80,000 and 700kg of rice for the bereaved family.""We deposited Rs 55,000 in their bank account and spent the rest on floor matting and kitchen utensils for them. This time too we are collecting money and everybody is contributing,"" said a neighbour, Mohammad Yousuf.The tension was palpable between the children's relatives from Jammu and their Muslim neighbours, who want the kids to live here or, as an alternative, move to Vessu village in the district, where the government has built quarters for Pandits.One of the children's relatives said the neighbours would perhaps take care of them for a month or two, not longer.""That's why we want some kind of security for them, like a government job for at least one of them. If they are reluctant to come with us, they should at least move to Vessu where they can be safe and imbibe Pandit cultural values,"" he said."

Still High,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/dry-still-highkallu-or-toddy-tadimahuakinnauri-195757?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-24,"Sonia SarkarBREWCREW: A Muria Gond tribal woman of central India prepares liquor from mahua (AFP)For tipplers in India, these are no happy hours. Prohibition seems to be the order of the day. First, the ban on sale of liquor by the Bihar government, and then, the Supreme Court diktat that says no vends or restaurants can sell alcohol within 500 metres of the highways. So the beer or rum or single malt might be near-endangered stuff, but desi liquor - the sour toddy, the pungent mahua, the fizzy kinnauri ghanti - is relatively free-flowing. In Haryana, there is no ban on tharra; toddy or tadi is still legally sold in Bihar; purchase and sale of cannabis is not permitted, but its derivative, bhang, can be bought and sold across India.And while politicians like to open and close the liquor tap depending on the political climate, their godly predecessors recognised its power, used it and prized it too. The Rigveda mentions soma, a juice derived from fermented milkweed, which was consumed by Hindu gods. And after the Prohibition in Bihar, the shrines of Masan Baba, Goraiya Baba and Bhairav - revered among the Dalit community and accepting only liquor as their first bhog - have virtually gone dry.References to alcoholic beverages are to be found in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat, too. In the paper titled ""Drinking habits in ancient India"", Ottilingam Somasundaram, D. Vijaya Raghavan and A.G. Tejus Murthy cite their popularity. How Baladev, Krishna and Arjun ""indulged in drink in the company of their wives, daughters and sisters""; how while crossing the Yamuna, Sita offered ""a 1,000 jars of arrack - alcoholic spirit made of coconut palm - and cooked flesh-meat"" for the goddesses.In keeping with what seems to be an ingrained love for the tipple, The Telegraph brings you an exhaustive list of indigenous intoxicating beverages from different parts of the country.Kallu or Toddy/ TadiIn her book Kerala: The Divine Destination, Lalitha Balasubramanian talks about Shiv's favoured cloudy palm wine, toddy. Made from the fresh sap of palm - date or coconut - toddy or kallu is popular in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.In Bihar, toddy becomes tadi, but its popularity remains undiminished. In 2016, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, lifted the ban on the sale and consumption of tadi in the state under pressure from his then ally, Lalu Prasad. When Lalu was the CM in the 1990s, he had declared it tax-free to help the Mahadalit Pasi community that is largely engaged as tadi tappers.MahuaWomen named Mahua - a common name in eastern India - have more often than not been teased by friends for being named after a heady drink derived from the mahua flower. Distilled in earthenware pots, the fiery mahua is popular in rural Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The Bhils of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat (a dry state, mind you) drink it. In Bastar too, a lot happens over mahua when motiyaris (girls) and cheliks (boys) of the Gond tribe come together in ghotuls or mixed-sex dormitories.Kinnauri ghantiTransparent like vodka, this all-season drink made of apple or apricot is popular among locals in Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. If you prefer fizzy drinks, you will enjoy it.ZawlaidiThis grape wine is a favourite drink in Hnahlan village of the Champhai district in Mizoram, and is considered to be a kind of love potion. High on alcohol content, the drink is supposed to be the best country-made liquor in India. Some brewers are also trying to market it globally.ChuwarakPrepared with rice, jackfruit and pineapple, it is the desi whiskey of Tripura. Local tokhiseleng and thakotor leaves are used to make this distilled alcohol.TharraThe pungent desi tharra, made of fermented sugarcane juice, is most popular in Punjab and Haryana. But a bottle of it, which was earlier available for Rs 20 or 30, is now going for Rs 80 because vends along the highways have closed down after the Supreme Court order. Tharra is literally the poor man's drink in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.FeniThe Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.Kesar kasturi and royal chandrahasHave you ever heard of dry fruits and spices being used to make alcohol? Well, it happens in Rajasthan. Made of saffron, herbs, nuts, seeds, sandalwood, clarified butter and natural aphrodisiacs, this drink is served at the winter gatherings of royal families. The royal chandrahas, also a winter drink, contains 76 different spices.AFP PictureBhangNo one needs an introduction to bhang, a paste of cannabis or marijuana buds and leaves. Despite the ban on sale and purchase of cannabis, bhang is widely available. Legend has it that the Hindu god, Shiv, fetched it from his abode in the Himalayas. And then, Bollywood went and turned it into the ""Holi drink"".RaksiUsually made out of finger millet ( ragi), raksi is a strong drink similar to vodka and gin. It's popular at social and religious events in Sikkim and neighbouring Nepal.ChhangThis is a millet beer that is consumed largely by the Memba and Libo tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, and also the Ladakhis. The millet is first boiled and then spread over a clean floor to cool. Later, dry yeast - locally known as oppop - is mixed with it and kept in a container for over 20 days to ferment. When the smell fills the room, you are bound to get drunk.The Ladakhis prepare their chhang in wooden drums called zem. Guests are served chhang with a blob of butter in a brass pot known as chhabskyen.Arak or arrackThis fiery Ladakhi whiskey is made by boiling and then collecting the vapour of chhang. It's a popular drink among Buddhists. People in Karnataka also drink arrack, but there it is made of fermented coconut flowers, sugarcane and rice grain.Rice beerAs part of their elaborate cultural ritual, Adivasis brew their own liquor and drink with the entire village. Rice is a common ingredient of almost every home-brewed liquor. The Pnar tribe of Meghalaya's Jaintia hills drinks kiad, a fizzy rice beer, served in bamboo tumblers. A liberal quantity of this triple-distilled liquor is offered to the local gods in a hollow gourd.In Assam, every other household in the tribal belt produces rice beer. Lao-pani is a common variety, another would be the apong. Often, the very smell of these intoxicates the wandering elephants, who then go on a rampage attacking locals. The Mishing tribe of Assam is fond of the apong and drinks it in plenty during weddings. It is said, the richer the beer the stronger the chemistry between the newly-weds.In neighbouring Nagaland, locals drink dzutse, ruhi and zutho - sour varieties of rice beer. In Manipur, nobody really cares about the state ban on liquor. Andro and sekmai, two varieties of yu - liquor made of fermented rice - are brewed in almost every household in the state capital of Imphal. Made from a local variety of rice called moirang phu, yu is generously offered to voters come poll time.And in the tribal belts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, handiya or hadiya is popular. Fermented over a week, it is also used to treat an upset stomach and certain gynaecological ailments. And in Himachal Pradesh, especially in the hilly Manali, locals drink lugdi.AFP PictureChuwanMade of rice, jackfruit and pineapple leaves, tokhiseleng roots and red chilli, chuwan is a local drink of Tripura. Brewed and served in langi, a small earthen pitcher, it is mostly prepared by women.Mrit Sanjeevani SuraIt is also known as mritasanjeevani arishta. This is not for binge drinkers. It is an ayurvedic syrup used to treat loss of appetite and weakness. It contains naturally generated alcohol.The Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.All in all, Prohibition or no, we are blessed in the swadeshi department. Let's make the most of it."
5b27f1b69855b720524c2bf5,GI Jane and the conquest of rasogollas,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/gi-jane-and-the-conquest-of-rasogollas-190543?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-03,"Prasun ChaudhuriBELONGINGS: (From top) The madur of Midnapore awaits its GI tag; rasogollas being preparedin a Calcutta shop; PIC: SUBHENDU CHAKIThe nondescript five-storey building in Calcutta's satellite town of Salt Lake is buzzing with excitement. It is 10am, and the third and fourth floors that house the offices of the Patent Information Centre (PIC) of the West Bengal State Science & Technology Council, are ringing with celebrations. Only minutes ago, application number 533 at the Geographical Indications Registry of the office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks, Chennai, has had a significant status update. It has moved from ""Examination"" to ""Registered"". Put simply, West Bengal's rasogolla has got itself the geographical indication (GI) tag.There is a queue of media professionals outside scientist and patent expert Mahuya Hom Chowdhury's office. She and her team have laboured for the past two years for the tag.What does she make of all talk of Bengal trumping Odisha? The bespectacled scientist's voice is a bit hoarse from all the talking, but she is patient, only too willing to explain the implications of the recent development. She says, ""A GI tag is nothing to fight over. It's a mark of assurance of authenticity and original source of a product. The ultimate goal is to tap the market potential for these products."" And though she doesn't support the Bengal versus Odisha rant, she believes media coverage helped raise awareness about geographical indication. ""The next step is to use the tag for quality enhancement of a product and market it properly to improve income of weavers, artisans or sweet-makers.""It's not just the rasogolla. From mangoes to sweetmeats, rice to saris and handicraft items, more than a dozen products from Bengal have been granted a GI tag since Hom Choudhury assumed charge of the PIC. The government employee refuses to be photographed, alone or with her team - permissions have to be in place. She stresses, however, that the Trinamul government supported the team all the way in this patent endeavour. Several NGOs have also worked closely to bring about the GI revolution in the state.""When I joined the patent office in 1999, GI and patent culture was yet to develop across the country,"" says Hom Choudhury. To learn more about the art of patent drafting and GI filing, she decided to be a patent attorney. ""I learnt the intricacies (of patenting). I also understood the importance of protecting our traditional heritage as well as recognising the intellectual property of our grassroots innovators. Bengal has a huge repository of heritage products that need to be protected,"" she adds.It so happened that Odisha didn't apply for a GI for the rasogolla. But when it comes to the overall GI score, the two states are on equal footing with a score of 15 registered GIs each.According to Hom Choudhury, filing an application for a GI or patent is an art. ""You need to know both the scientific and legal aspects of a product. Also, one needs to collect a whole lot of data from the producers,"" adds Paromita Sen, a junior scientist who works at the PIC.Dhiman Das is director of K.C. Das Pvt. Ltd. His great-great-grandfather is said to have invented the rasogolla in 1868. He says, ""Applying for GI is not an easy job. You need to furnish a whole lot of historical documents, make a detailed presentation. We produced the document, which was efficiently presented by Dr Hom Choudhury and her team.""Adds Jagannath Ghosh, the Calcutta-based secretary of Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samiti, the association of sweetmakers of Bengal, ""We provided several sets of samples from different sweet shops for chemical analysis following the advice of scientists at PIC. All of it was meticulously collated and presented by them.""A GI application needs to be filed to the office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks. A consultative group on the product for which a GI tag has been sought meets to discuss the merits of it. If the panel is satisfied with the information, the application is advertised in the Geographical Indications Journal. This is an opportunity for all - individuals, organisations, states - to counter it. And the permitted time period is four months. After that, the product automatically gets a GI tag. A certificate from the GI Registry follows.The application in case of Banglar Rasogolla was filed in September 2015.There was no culture of patenting in India for a long while. Although Bengal had a rich legacy of intellectual property, scientists didn't want to profit from their research. That is why Jagadis Chandra Bose never filed a patent for the radio he invented. But Italian engineer Guglielmo Marconi developed, demonstrated and marketed the wireless telegraph and got worldwide recognition.In the mid-1990s, India became a member of the World Trade Organization and the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights came into effect. Scientists slowly woke up to the importance of patenting their inventions. Also, with the introduction of new trade practices, the protection of trade names and trademarks used for food products of a particular geography came into practice. Sparkling wine of a particular area in France was recognised with a GI tag, after a prolonged and bitter legal battle between France and the US. There was a similar scuffle over Basmati between India, US and Pakistan.Hom Chowdhury was aware of these debates and discussions when she began her career in the patent office. At the time she had just completed her PhD in Food Technology from Jadavpur University. ""She'd been an extremely bright student here,"" says Professor Utpal Roy Choudhuri from the department of Food Technology and Biochemical Engineering. ""Her thesis was on extruded fish protein or utilisation of fish waste,"" he adds. Hom Chowdhury also went on to patent her invention, extruded snacks from waste food material. If that sounds complicated, she is not willing to elaborate further. ""I have plans to market the invention sometime in future. This will help create wealth out of food wastes,"" is all that she says.Hom Choudhury's basics in Food Technology helped her hone her skills as a patent specialist in the field. Before the rasogolla victory, she got the GI for Joynagarer Moa - prepared from date palm jaggery and puffed rice - Mihidana and Sitabhog from Burdwan. Two more sweetmeats - Sarpuria and Sarbhaja from Krishnagar - are expected to get the tag soon.Saikat Datta, general manager, District Industries Centre, Burdwan, worked with Hom Choudhury's team for patent applications for Mihidana and Sitabhog. ""We encouraged the manufacturers in Burdwan to form an association and follow a standardised process of manufacturing. Then we helped them apply for the GI tag,"" he says. They'd even gone to the GI registry office in Chennai to understand the procedure of application.But the first GI tags associated with her team have to do with three mango varieties - Laxmanbhog, Himsagar and Fazli. This was followed by tags for traditional textiles, especially saris - Santipur, Baluchari and Dhaniakhali.In the field of agriculture, the PIC team is now focussing on varieties of indigenous rice that are becoming extinct as more and more farmers are gravitating towards high-yielding seeds. The first GI tags on agricultural products in the state were gained for two rice varieties - Gobindobhog and Tulaipanji. Prof. Mrityunjay Ghosh of the department of Agronomy, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani, says, ""We organised the scientific and historical documents and PIC scientists offered their legal expertise. They co-ordinated with the GI Registry office at Chennai.""Handicrafts is another area of focus for Hom Choudhury and her team. GI applications for five items - including Chhau dance masks from Purulia, madurs (grass mats) and patachitras (scroll paintings) from East Midnapore - have been submitted. ""The PIC team researched the legacy of these traditional crafts. We gave them information on the current status and details of craft hubs and practitioners,"" says Niloy Basu, the general manager of Banglanatok.com, a social enterprise that promotes indigenous craft and culture.Says Hom Choudhury, ""So far, so good. GI tag is just the beginning of a process to tap the immense potential of our treasures and improve quality. Now we need to go ahead to the next step in a more structured way to make things suitable for the international market."""

Paul, then head of the paediatrics department at AIIMS, submitted its report.""The recommendations are unlikely to be accepted. The suggestion of reducing the cereal content may be politically upsetting,"" a top official source said.A meal for students of primary classes (I-V) now contains 5gm of ghee or oil. For upper primary students (Classes VI-VIII) the ghee or oil content is 7.5gm.Besides, each meal includes 100gm of rice or wheat for primary students and 150gm for upper primary students, apart from vegetables and pulses.The panel, set up in July 2015 to suggest changes to improve a meal's nutritional value, recommended reducing the food grain content to 90gm for primary students and 125gm for upper primary students. It found that children were often unable to finish the rice and wheat they are served.The proposed changes would have led to an increase in the cost of each meal from Rs 4.13 to Rs 6.18 at the primary level and from Rs 5.88 to Rs 8.88 at the upper primary level.Ten crore children in 11.5 lakh government and aided schools are served midday meals every day.Dr Abhay Bang, a public health expert and chairperson of the Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health that works in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra, supported the Paul committee's recommendations.Bang said 5gm of oil for 100gm of rice or wheat created an imbalanced diet. Rice and wheat don't have protein, so the oil content should be increased, he said.""If there is less fat content, the food is not palatable and the child cannot finish it. The committee's recommendations were in the right direction,"" Bang added.Food rights activist Ashok Rao quoted from a study to say that 82 per cent of schoolchildren in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, came to school on an empty stomach and felt sleepy after a rice- or wheat-based meal.""It affects their cognitive development. The government should rather divide the meal into some snack in the morning and a light meal in the afternoon. For that, the government's approach must change,"" Rao said.He said 46 per cent of children suffered from malnutrition, while 30 per cent of girls were anaemic, and argued for flexibility to serve cereals like millets to suit local tastes or other food items."

Picture by Pheroze L VincentNew Delhi: The mother of an 11-year-old Jharkhand girl, who died of alleged starvation after her family was denied food because their ration card had not been linked to Aadhaar, has contradicted the state government's claim that malaria killed her daughter.At a media conference organised by the Right to Food Campaign, Koili Devi said she has come to Delhi with activists as revenue officials and villagers have been harassing her family and accusing them of defaming the village, Karimati, in Simdega district.""We had not cooked for eight days as we did not get ration. We don't earn enough, so we had been borrowing rice from neighbours. But it got over,"" Koili Devi said, her two-and-a-half-year-old son Prakash at her breast.""There was some tea which we brewed and had with salt. At night, Santoshi complained of stomach pain. Around 10pm she was dead.""State officials maintain Santoshi Kumari died of malaria. But food activists have slammed the overzealous state government, accusing it of denying foodgrain under the public distribution system to the poorest of the poor in a bid to weed out fake beneficiaries.Koili's family has eight members, including her four children and her 24-year-old sister Gudiya, her mentally challenged husband Tatya Naik and his mother. Six of them are on the family's ration card.They stopped getting rations, which include 30kg of rice per month for Re 1 a kilo, since February after their Aadhaar cards did not get linked their ration card, Taramani Sahu of the Jharkhand NREGA Watch said.""I found this family to be the poorest in Karimati village that does not get rations. On August 21, I informed the collector, Manjunath Bhajantri, about their condition. On September 1, I complained again after the ration card was deleted. On September 25, I sent another reminder. On September 28, the day of Ashtami, Santoshi died,"" Sahu said.She added: ""The government's report has no mention of Koili's statement and they have continued to brand the family as drunkards whose daughter died of malaria, without any post mortem being done.""The government has since put on hold its previous order to stop rations for ration cards not linked to Aadhaar.""After our child died, many politicians came and gave money, some gave rice,"" Gudiya said. ""But on Diwali, some villagers ransacked the house and kicked the vessel in which we had cooked chicken. Our rice was dumped in a ditch and we have been stopped from using the village hand pump and the local shop, as we have defamed the village.""Prakash, the two-and-a-half-year-old, has a swollen stomach, a symptom of malnutrition."
5b27f44a9855b720524c2e40,Proposal to link rural wage to expenses,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/proposal-to-link-rural-wage-to-expenses-184926?ref=india-new-stry,2017-11-10,"Basant Kumar MohantyNew Delhi: The rural development ministry has suggested linking wage revisions under the national village job scheme MGNREGA to the rise in the average expenses of a household the previous year to ensure higher earnings than what the workers have been getting.The ministry has sought the finance ministry's approval to follow the Consumer Price Index (CPI) Rural, instead of the Consumer Price Index Agricultural Labourer (CPIAL), as is done now, while revising the wage rate under the scheme next February.The finance ministry is yet to respond to the proposal, sources said.The CPI Rural, calculated by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation, takes into account expenses on everything including food, light, fuel, transport, education and recreation.The CPIAL, a measure of the retail inflation faced by farm workers calculated by the Labour Bureau, also looks at these expenses but the weightage given to food items is higher.Following the implementation of the National Food Security Act, most rural families get 5 kilos of rice per person in a month at Rs 3 a kilo.As the price of many agricultural products is low because of food subsidy - most rural families get 5 kilos of rice per person in a month at Rs 3 a kilo under the National Food Security Act - the CPIALis low too. That leads to an insignificant increase in the wage rate.For instance, the per-day wagerate increased by Re 1 in five states this year.Officials in the rural development ministry said the CPI Rural was more scientific.If the ministry eventually follows the CPI Rural, it will have to bear an additional yearly expenditure of over Rs 1,000 crore only on wages under the MGNREGA, which provides for up to 100 days of unskilled work for every rural household.The ministry had earlier set up a committee under additional secretary Nagesh Singh to look into a demand for parity between the MGNREGA wage in a state and the minimum wage of the state concerned. The MGNREGA wage is lower than the minimum wage in 17 states.The panel had rejected the proposal for wage parity, arguing that some states tend to revise their minimum wages too often."

But within days of its journey rolling out from the north, the yatra got bogged down in controversy. By getting into a Mini Cooper belonging to a hawala accused in Kozhikode's Koduvally town, yatra leader and state CPM secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan inadvertently pressed the wrong gear.BJP state secretary K. Surendran was the first to puncture the yatra by posting on Facebook the picture of a beaming Kodiyeri in the vehicle, only to be taken up by Muslim League and the Congress very soon.The Mini Cooper, now found to be falsely registered in neighbouring Puducherry, belonged to Karat Faizal, an alleged smuggler who happens to be the younger brother of the CPM-backed legislator of Koduvally, Karat Razak. Although Kodiyeri feigned ignorance, not many took it at face value.But a bigger Mini Cooper in the form of Thomas Chandy, state transport minister and the representative of Sharad Pawar's NCP in the government, was awaiting the yatra from the south, led by Kanam Rajendran, state secretary of the CPI, the other major partner of the Front.A moneybag bereft of any Left leaning, Chandy, facing serious accusations of flouting wetland rules allegedly under the benevolent protection of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, literally broke the yatra axle while in Kuttanad, one-time rice bowl of the state in central Kerala.Chandy, better known with his suffix 'Kuwait' in the area, has made his money in the Gulf and hence the sobriquet. He managed to bag an Assembly ticket and then became a minister by default, some say by design, when the other representative of NCP had to quit as minister following charges of lewd conversation over the phone with a woman reporter.Within months of his induction, Chandy was at the centre of a controversy swirling around alleged filling of backwaters to lay a road to his swanky multi-crore resort in Alappuzha, Venice of the East.Although the district collector in her report has indicted Chandy, the CPM leadership has termed the report ""one-sided"". As the Opposition and leading environmentalists clamoured for his resignation and a proper probe into the allegations, the chief minister told the Assembly that the attack on Chandy was ""politically motivated"".The CPI, which holds the revenue ministry, had differed with the chief minister, but Vijayan has brushed aside the objections.Chandy, while presiding over an event to felicitate Rajendran, went on a tirade against his critics saying that no one, ""not even investigating agencies will be able to lift a little finger"" against him.It was considered a statement made with the full backing from the government. It was also seen as an open challenge to the CPI that has been at loggerheads with the CPM on important issues, especially land deals.The deafening silence on the part of the chief minister has added legitimacy to the growing belief that the Left Front is with and for the moneyed class. As the Janajagrata Yatra winds up on Friday, the CPM stands exposed for its ever-growing association with controversial characters.More than the people of Kerala, it is the party that needs to be cautious about the pitfalls lying ahead of it."

MudurNew Delhi: An independent academic study has found India's emissions of methane, a major greenhouse gas that drives global warming, are consistent with the government's estimates and have shown little growth over the past five years.The study has found that India's average emissions of methane emissions - mainly from paddy fields and cows, among other sources - were about 22 trillion grams per year between 2010 and 2015, consistent with India's emissions reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The scientists who conducted the study say their estimates for India's methane emissions are about 30 per cent smaller than figures in a global inventory of greenhouse gases calculated by an international research consortium called the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.""Our approach should help bolster confidence in India's official estimates,"" said Anita Ganesan, an environmental chemist at the University of Bristol in the UK who led the study published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. ""Estimating the methane emissions is particularly challenging, and this work demonstrates a new way to do that.""The concentrations of methane, the second-most powerful greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, have been growing in the atmosphere in recent years. But methane emissions are much harder to estimate because they emerge from biological systems influenced by the environment.""Methane emissions from rice paddies, for example, are influenced by temperature, rainfall or irrigation, fertiliser applications, so emissions can vary dramatically from one place to another and at different times,"" Ganesan said. ""This makes methane more difficult to account for in inventories.""Ganesan and her colleagues from institutions in Germany, India, the UK and the US combined satellite imagery and ground and aircraft observations with computer models of the atmosphere and winds to arrive at estimates for methane emissions for each month between 2010 and 2015.Their study showed spikes in methane between June and September each year, the monsoon season, when paddy is grown across the country. The stable methane emissions in India contrast with China where measurements have suggested increasing emissions of methane in recent years.Ganesan said the growth in China has been shown to be driven by large increases in fossil fuel emissions of methane. In India, fossil fuels make up a much smaller source of the methane emissions, which are overwhelmingly generated from agriculture - paddy and livestock.The study also showed a small winter peak in emissions, which the scientists say could be due to winter rice that makes up about 14 per cent of total rice production in India or due to increases in fossil fuel emissions."

It comes at a time his government is under attack over several issues.Pictures of party lawmakers P.T.A. Raheem and Karat Razak posing with alleged gold smuggler Abu Liaz, and their purported links with another alleged gold smuggler, Karat Faisal, have left the CPM squirming. The party's just-ended Janajagruti Yatra saw state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan riding a Mini Cooper belonging to Faisal.State transport minister Thomas Chandy has been accused of land encroachment.Vijayan will be following a tradition. Late CPM chief minister E.K.

Blast is a commonly known and economically significant fungal disease of rice The disease becomes more or less endemic after the introduction of fine grain type varieties like BPT-5204 (Samba mahsuri) and improved white ponni in a larger area. The disease is caused by the fungus Pyricularia oryzae that attacks the rice crop at all stages right from the seedling in the nursery to the main field. The symptoms can be seen on leaves, nodes, neck of panicle as well as on grains.On the leaves, the lesions start as small water-soaked bluish green flecks and soon enlarge and form characteristic spindle-shaped or eye-shaped spots with grey centre and dark brown margin (leaf blast).During flowering to grain filling stage, the basal portion of the panicle (neck) shows dark brown to black spots. Often the panicle breaks at the infected point in the neck and the panicle fall off (neck blast).This neck blast causes heavy economic loss to the rice farmers and the symptom normally occurs during the winter months of December and January. Blast-infected grains become poorly filled and chaffy. Dark spots may also form on the grains and reduce the grain quality."

Candles will be lit by the fishermen who have survived the cyclone fury. In the capital city, the vigil will be held at Sanghumugham beach at 6pm on Monday. Meanwhile, the chief ministers office confirmed that there will be no official celebrations in the state, yet stray incidents of celebrations at beaches for tourism promotion by district tourism promotion council ( DTPC ) may be held.A central team is expected to visit Kerala on Tuesday to assess the damage caused by Ockhi as the state has requested for additional disaster relief. There will be no government-led official Christmas celebrations this year. Minor celebrations to attract tourists will be conducted by DTPC. Though DTPC forms part of the government, such celebrations cannot be ruled out. The state government plans to offer a package to the 212 Ockhi-affected fishermen families identified in the state during the Christmas-New Year eve. It includes distribution of rice and other provisions and Rs 10,000 per family, officials attached to the CMs office said. In addition, Manaveeyam street cultural collective ( MSCC ), an independent organization, plans to distribute rice and green gram to the Ockhi-affected families in a mobile van on Sunday and Monday as part of their Snehasparsham project to support Ockhi-affected people. It has been planned to distribute 1,000kg rice and green gram.The vehicle starting from Manaveeyam Road will cover Vizhinjam, Kottappuram and Adimalathura areas, MSCC secretary K G Suraj said. National fish workers forum general secretary T Peter said that the state government should stop all Christmas celebrations using government funds. We have sought the state government to stop spending government money for official Christmas celebration along the beaches when the fishermen are grieving. Instead, the state should set aside that fund for Ockhi disaster relief, he said. Kerala independent fish workers federation secretary Anto Eliyas too urged the state not to conduct any official Christmas celebration. They have also sought the state to strengthen the search operations as over 90 fishermen are still missing. Officials at Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) said that the central team led by disaster management division (home affairs) additional secretary Bipin Mallick will make an inspection visit on Tuesday for statutory assessment of the disaster.The central team visit is based on the memorandum submitted by Kerala to the Centre for additional disaster relief assistance of Rs 422 crore as part of national disaster relief funds (NDRF). This is in addition to the Rs 7,000-crore Ockhi relief package submitted by Kerala to the Centre, the KSDMA official said. Meanwhile, KSDMA, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services and Indian meteorological department have alerted fishermen to be cautious while venturing into the sea due to high waves and strong winds.High waves in the range of 3 to 3.1metres (above 10 feet) are forecast from 5.30pm on Saturday to 11.30pm on Tuesday along Kerala coast. They have also warned of strong winds from the north easterly and easterly direction in the range of 45-55 kmph along Kerala coast."

November and December usually usher in good tidings for the 50-odd families involved in this profession, but this year its not the same For the family of Vinayak Baba , a manja maker from Matha Khidki area of Dabeerpura, the profession is no longer about reeling in profits but basic survival. I was about to quit last year after I realized that it is no longer profitable but I have been doing this since childhood and have no other skills, says Baba.Baba laments that manja makers are in dire straits mainly due to the soaring preference for Chinese manja that uses plastic instead of traditional manja that is made of gum, glass and rice.Most families involved in manja making are staring at a bleak future. The illegal trade of Chinese manja has been thriving despite bans and raids by the police, explains Anil Raj, a second generation manja maker from Dhoolpet.Manja-making has been a ritual for male members of these families, who prepare a mixture of gum, glass and rice every day from 6am to 1pm. The pulp is rubbed against regular thread to give a fine and cutting edge but since there are very few orders now, the practice has been reduced to just two or three days in a week, adds Baba.Backwhen kites used to fly high on traditional manja, these families would spend eight months preparing thread. Today, they do so only for about three to four months.Poor returns add to their woes. Dealers who buy thread from us are also not giving a good deal. We are forced to sell our products for a loss for fear that it will go waste, said Imran Khan from Dhoolpet, pointing out that they are paid anywhere just 20-50 for converting a plain thread bundle of 3,000 metres into manja. How can this meagre amount be sufficient when the cost of living is so high in this city? asks Imran.Male members of these families have now switched to driving autos or working as labourers. They have to take up other professions to support their families. Continuing with the painstaking work of making manja, which offers hardly any returns, makes no sense, says Anand Kumar, a resident of Dabeerpura."

Awho made a windfall  momentarily -- through the trick realized that the superstition definitely attracts bad luck; and the jury is out on the money bit.The scam involves pulling rice with a tumbler during the demonstration. The confidence tricksters then claim that just as the tumbler attracted the grains of rice, it can pull untold wealth into the house of the individual buying the tumbler. Several people have fallen prey to this trick.In this case, the sub-inspector apprehended the scamsters selling rice-pulling tumblers to gullible people; but he decided to con them in turn. After raiding the place where the alleged cheating was taking place, he siphoned off Rs 9.75 lakh of the money recovered from them. An enquiry by a higher officer found the PSIs con and he has been booked for cheating and causing disappearance of evidence of offence.DC Manju is thefromwho has been booked by the police in Chikkaballapura. The police recently filed a charge sheet in the case and Manju approached the High Court to get the case quashed. The case has a long history dating back to 2011. On December 27 that year, police received information that some people were cheating the public by selling rice-pulling tumblers near Kaiwara Cross.PSI Manju went to the spot and apprehended four persons and recovered a sum of Rs 4.65 lakh from them and a case was registered. That was Manjus side of the story.Soon, allegations arose that Manju had siphoned off some of the money seized in that raid. The assistant superintendent of police, Chikkaballapura, probed the matter and found that Manju had misused Rs 9.75 lakh from the money he seized.A case was booked against Manju and four others. In October 2016, the Magistrate committed the case to the Sessions Court. The Sessions judge initiated proceedings earlier this year.According to the investigation, Manju had kept Rs 9.75 lakh in another police station. The ASP who was investigating the issue searched thepolice station. The money was kept there for some time and moved elsewhere. The money was then found in another location and the case was booked.Manju challenged the case against him in the High Court on two grounds. Firstly, the police investigation against him was illegal as they had investigated the issue before registering a case. Secondly, the two allegations against him (cheating and hiding evidence) can only be tried by a Magistrate but the case had been committed to a Sessions court.The HC noted that the sentence under Section 420 (cheating) is seven years while for causing disappearance of evidence under Section 201 is one-fourth of the punishment of the main offence. Section 420 can be tried by a Magistrate as also Section 201 if the imprisonment prescribed is less than 10 years. Therefore the case cannot be tried by the Sessions Court.While the HC refused to quash the case against Manju, it ordered the Sessions judge to re-transmit the records to the Magistrate court in Chintamani."

Turning the tables on the opposition, he even called on them to demand such a list under RTI from his government, but they would be unable to provide it, as it didnt exist.The startling revelation came while Fadnavis was replying to the marathon discussion under Rule 293 moved by the opposition benches, which lasted over two days. He also disclosed that many sugar factories had taken loans in the name of farmers, without informing the farmers themselves, by submitting their 7/12 extracts to banks during the UPAs loan waiver.Citing Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, he pointed out that many influential persons from Kolhapur and Satara were granted benefits in the UPAs loan waiver. This included Yuvraj Patil, who received Rs38 lakh, and Vijay Sinh Patil, who received Rs9.11 lakh. I will provide the list of farmers being given benefit by our government, unlike yours, he taunted.When Jayant Patil pointed out that many of these beneficiaries didnt receive the money, after objections were raised and cases were pending in the Supreme and high courts, the CM asked where all this money had gone, and hinted at a bigger scam here. We will inquire into this bungling. Our government has learnt from your mistakes, he said.While admitting blunders in depositing loan waiver amount into accounts of non-beneficiaries, including MLAs, he passed the buck to banks, for having sent wrong names to the government. Its true that the amount was deposited in the account of MLA Prakash Abitkar, but it was the banks fault since original beneficiary was Prakash Sutar. We received about 37 applications with Abitkar surname, of which one had initials of Prakash. Similar thing happened with Vasant More, where original beneficiary was Latabai Patil.Blaming the banks for the mess, Fadnavis said the government had already inked a pact with them for data validation of beneficiaries, and they would be completely responsible for any error. We havent provided our data of farmers to them. We asked them to prepare their own list after validating it. We then matched it with direct applications invited from farmers. We initially received over 1.03 crore applications. After biometric tests and removing duplication, about 77 lakh accounts were found to be genuine. After subtracting ineligible beneficiaries as per our new norms, weve decided to deposit money into accounts of about 67 lakh farmers.Earlier, the CM added to his figures of loan waiver, which he had announced last week while replying to discussion on the same subject and on the same motion but moved by the treasury benches.He said about 48 lakh accounts had been cleared till Wednesday out of 67 lakh applications received from farmers. Of them, 34 lakh were loan accounts while 14 lakh were of those provided incentives for timely repayment of loans. Cumulatively, an amount of Rs23,300 crore has been disbursed so far. Since last week, weve cleared 4.72 lakh more accounts and approved Rs2,578 crore payment under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana and daily updation is underway. There would be no discrimination between farmers, whether backing BJP or NCP.NCP leader Ajit Pawar demanded action against sugar mills owners for duping farmers, and even bank officials. On Hasan Mushrifs query, Fadnavis said the banks were told to close those accounts and not to levy any interest.Meet of MLAs from drought hit areas todayAgriculture minister Pandurang Phundkar announced that a meeting of MLAs from drought-hit areas of Vidarbha would be convened on Thursday at 4pm. After receiving inputs from them, we will consult with the CM and take a decision to benefit rice and cotton growers, whose crops were destroyed due to incessant rains or bollworm and aphid attack.Even the CM endorsed him, saying that the government would announce a package before the end of the winter session on Friday."

The synagogue is not internationally known like the one at Mattancherry, but amazes you with its architectural beauty, once you step inside.Last week, the caretakers of the synagogue, Josephai Babu Elias and Ofera Elias, celebrated the Jewish festival Hanukkah all by themselves at the synagogue. Every evening after sundown from December 14 to 20, Josephai lit the customary Hanukkah lamp placed at the entrance, reading from the Torah, the Hebrew Bible, thereafter. The lamp has eight wicks, and each evening, one additional wick is lit till the last day, when all eight are lit. The lamp commemorates a miracle; it was lit with oil for just one day but lasted for eight days. During Hanukkah, it is kept at the entrance of every home and synagogue so that the light falls on it, says Ofera.Hanukkah is one of the most important of Jewish festivals, and is usually celebrated by families getting together to exchange gifts, have specially prepared foods, sing hymns and play the dreidal, a kind of dice game. For Josephai and Ofera, their two daughters have moved to Mumbai and Israel respectively, and so there isnt much of a celebration.But Josephai remembers how they used to burst crackers during Hanukkah, in his childhood. We never had a dreidal but played a board game brought from Iraq, with manjadi seeds. My mother used to make pastel and hubba, rice stuffed in onion.He is also one of the only four people in Kochi who know to read the Torah today. When I was small, my grandmother would try to get me and my brother to read the Torah with her and learn Hebrew better but we were least interested and would doze off. I regret not mastering it now, he says.Ofera grew up in Mumbai, among a large Jewish community and also studied in a Jewish school, so she too has learnt Hebrew. For Hanukkah, we would make foods made in oil and celebrate together. This time, I just made batata fritters. If friends visit us from Israel, they bring us chocolate gold coins which are gifted during Hanukkah. This time, there were no visitors, though, she says.The synagogue, which dates back to 1200 AD, has seen numerous burglaries and renovations before reaching its current state. Looked after by a trust made of Josephai and his brothers, its pillars on the front face the direction of Jerusalem, and the 10 huge windows signify the Ten Commandments. The balcony upstairs was where women used to be seated, away from the vision of the men. The rooms in the front housed a Hebrew medium school, till 1948. Thieves destroyed the building and stole the original brass lamps. I have ordered new ones from Israel. I have also re-laid the floor tiles, with handmade ones from Karaikudy, Tamil Nadu.Any Jew can drop in and offer their prayers at the synagogue, and often, foreign tourists from Israel drop by, they say.Doesnt Josephai wish to move to Israel as well? At the age of 14, I wanted to, but my grandmother stopped me as she wanted someone to conduct the rites, as my father had died two years ago. In 1983, I tried to move again, but was again stopped, by my mother.Today, he holds the Jewish traditions close to his heart, but feels that ones motherland is the best place to be. Perhaps it was my destiny because God wanted someone to take care of this synagogue and make it more beautiful, he says, as he and Ofera step out of the synagogue, kissing the Mezuzah, the leather parchment pasted on the door."

The song Bhojanam seyya vaarungal, for instance, is traditionally sung at weddings, she adds.Pradeep Chakravarthy , a behaviourist who conducts heritage tours, says references to food can be found in dancedramas dating to the Maratha period. There were two dance-dramas Shiva Pallaki Prabandham and Vishnu Pallaki Prabandham  that were performed during the reign of Shahaji, one of the Maratha rulers of Thanjavur. They speak of the food served to Shiva and Parvati. The songs describe dishes such as moru kozhambu (gravy made of buttermilk), curd rice and Pongal, and the meal ends with water from the Ganges and vethala pak (betel leaves), says Chakravarthy.In the 9th century, Periyalvar, says Chakravarthy, one of the 12 Alvar saints of south India, mentions the sweet kummayam, one of Krishnas favourite dishes made of rice, green gram, cows ghee, curd, banana and sugar in the verses of Divya Prabhandam.Art is inspired by food and vice-versa, says Raghunathan. And what better time to explore this than the Margazhi season."

The bench during the course of subsequent hearings was told about the shortage of food inspectors to deal with the growing menace of food adulteration. The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 requires states to have sufficient number of food inspectors and other staff along with labs.When the case hearing resumed on Tuesday, amicus curiae S Niranjan Reddy told the court that the problem in both states has acquired serious proportions with milk being adulterated with urea, rice with plastic. Dal, oil, etc., too are not being spared and the health of the people in general and children in particular is getting adversely affected, he said. Each state needs a minimum of 600 food inspectors, but AP has 14 and Telangana 24 food inspectors, the bench said referring to the counters filed by officials. The amicus curiae reminded the court that Tamil Nadu has 540 food inspectors. Even in Telangana, the department of legal meteorology has 600 inspectors to deal with irregularities pertaining to weights and measures. That is the reason why complaints on that front are relatively less. But in the case of Food Adulteration, Hyderabad with nearly 90 lakh population needs at least 20,000 inspections of all markets a year. However, only two inspections were carried out in Telangana in the last one year. We need 600 food inspectors each for the two states. Hyderabad alone may require 200 inspectors, Niranjan said. The case will come up for hearing after four weeks."

Weathermen, however, foresee clearer skies in coming days. Picture by Hardeep SinghRanchi: After Diwali's washout, Ranchi's Chhath devotees who want to prepare for the sun god's worship are finding it tough to do so as the sun hides behind clouds.The four-day Chhath starts from October 24 with nahay khay (ritual bathing and fasting), kharna (breaking the fast) a day after, and the main two days of sun worship, October 26-27, with evening and morning arghya (offering prayers to the sun god).Social worker Rakesh Bhasker who performs Chhath at his Harmu Housing Colony home for decades on Saturday said they were finding it impossible to dry wheat under the sun due to the weather.""Wheat is a must for Chhath pakwan (festive dishes). As Chhath is a festival of purity, wheat must be washed and dried properly in the sun before being ground into flour for thekua and gujia. We are compelled to dry wheat under the fan now,"" social worker Bhasker said.Sunil Kumar Kamal, an employee of Vinoba Bhave University, who has been performing Chhath for a quarter of a century at his Kishoreganj home, echoed the same concern. ""Even for kheer in kharna, washed rice must be dried in the sun. This time, it looks like the fan will be the substitute for sun if the sky doesn't clear up.""Another Chhath devotee, Srikant (he uses his first name only), pointed out a basic problem. ""Arghya is offered to rising and setting sun. In case of cloudy weather, people will offer arghya without seeing the sun and it will be difficult to wash the ghat with cow dung, a ritual that needs to be done. Ghats will be slippery with threat of accidents,"" he said.These problems are already surfacing. Dhurwa dam water is already high, making it difficult for people to make ghats. In Argora, Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) couldn't press earthmovers on muddy banks to lift silt from ponds.RMC deputy mayor Sanjeev Vijayvargiya conceded the problems. ""Weather is not under our control but we are trying to clean water bodies and ensure stone dusting at ghats to curb slips. We will inspect ghats with urban development minister C.P.

Pictures by Bhola PrasadJamshedpur: Fasting for 36 hours may seem a tall task, but Chhath vratis do it with ease every year. Two families that have been taking part in arduous rituals for generations shared the mantra behind their indomitable spirit on festive Tuesday.The first day of Chhath begins with nahay khay, when devotees are required to take a dip in preferably a holy river and carry the water to prepare the only meal - primarily lauki-bhaat or bottle gourd and rice - they will allow themselves during the day.Tripti Singh (40), a fitness instructor who has been celebrating Chhath for 10 years, explained the science behind the one meal before the fast without water.""Bottle gourd purifies the body and keeps it hydrated. It is a tough fast and the body needs stamina and water. Besides lauki-bhaat, which is also offered to the sun god, we cook channa dal and aloo bhujiya, but everything without garlic and onion. This is a one-time platter for lunch and the next meal will be kheer-puri on kharna evening, which is on Wednesday,"" she said.The resident of Adityapur celebrates Chhath with her septuagenarian mother-in-law Rani Singh.""We devotees get all the protein and carbohydrates from the nahay khay meal,"" Tripti said, adding that the family had been fasting on Chhath for more than 100 years and she was a fourth generation vrati.Rani recalled how rigorous Chhath rituals were earlier. ""My grandparents in Benaras had to stay at Ganga ghat on all four days. They performed the rituals on the banks. Nowadays, pollution and health concerns keep us away from rivers. We offer arghya in an artificial tank on the terrace,"" she said.In Bagbera, Central University of Jharkhand teacher Kavita Parmar (37) began her rituals with sister-in-law Indu Devi (48), who is three-decade Chhath veteran.""It is all about piety. We show our devotion to the sun, which is considered the source of life on Earth.

Refuting this, Simdega administration called it a natural death, the rural medical practitioner who treated Santoshi at her Karimati village home in Jaldega block calling her symptoms ""like malaria"".An independent fact-finding report by non-profit Right to Food Campaign and NREGA Watch corroborated the family's claim that the PDS dealer refused them grain without Aadhaar linkage.Simdega DC Manjunath Bhajantri on his part argued a three-member panel comprising civil surgeon Dr Ezazuddin Ahmad, district supply officer Nandji Ram and ITDA project director Jagat Narayan Prasad in their inquiry report ""confirmed"" the girl was ill and ruled out starvation death.The inquiry panel found 35kg to 40kg of rice grain at the dead girl's home on October 13, Bhajantri pointed out.At the same time, the inquiry report (a copy of which is available with this correspondent) added that the PDS ration card was issued in Santoshi's grandmother Balwati Devi's name, who did not have Aadhaar. Hence, the point-of-sale machine with the PDS dealer could not ascertain the old woman's thumb impression and Balwati did not receive any PDS supply after February 2017.So, there is nothing to substantiate that the stock of rice grain, found by the inquiry panel two weeks after Santoshi's death, was there when she was alive.With a section of the national media reporting that the girl had died crying ""bhaat, bhaat (cooked rice)"", chief minister Das, who was in Simdega on Tuesday to console the bereaved kin of deceased BJP leaders Manoj Nageshia and Vijay Shrivastava, asked the DC to cross-check facts in the inquiry report.""No poor person should be denied PDS ration or any welfare benefit if he or she doesn't have an Aadhaar card,"" Das is learnt to have said.State's food and civil supplies minister Saryu Roy stressed no one had so far formally complained about the suspected starvation death.

She was bemused when the chief minister asked her for a glass of water after delivering the rice packet to her.Paharin was the first beneficiary of the state governments recently launched Food Post scheme for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in her Surajbera village in Pakur districts Littipara block, around 400 km from Jharkhand capital Ranchi.Das, who was in Santhal Pargana on Thursday to launch government schemes worth Rs 280.67 crore, kicked off the scheme at the village by delivering the food packet at her doorstep. The CM told her that she would receive such packet every month at her doorstep and her family would not have to make rounds of dealers and the block.Over 24,000 families of Pahariya tribe of Santhal Paragana will be linked to the scheme soon, Das told the villagers.The Jharkhand government on April 3 started its ambitious food post scheme to provide food at the doorsteps of 70,000 vulnerable tribal families of the state, which are enrolled under the National Food Security Act (NFSA)The scheme is the first-of-its-kind in India, and through this, the state government seeks to provide food to PVTG families with the help of special messengers, who will deliver food packets to these tribal households.NFSA was launched in Jharkhand on September 25, 2015 and covers more than 2.63 crore people out of the states 3.29 crore population. Under the scheme, PVTGs are entitled to 35 kg of free ration per month.PVTGs live in jungles and hills because of which they have not been able to reap benefits of NFSA.Sundarin Paharin said: We have to walk around 12 km to reach the block headquarters for free ration. At times, we have to return emptyhanded. The scheme will save our time and money.As per a survey conducted in villages with PVTG population, families of the Soriya Paharaiya, an endangered PVTG, have to spend up to Rs 300 to access their free ration in blocks.As per the Supreme Court order dated November 28, 2001, ration distribution should be available free of cost every month to all PVTG families at a nearest point. Unfortunately, the so-called nearest points for many of the PVTGs means travelling up to 50-60 km, said Balram, a Right to Food activist, who had carried out the survey.The government has set a target to cover all districts of Jharkhand under the drive by the end of April."
5b2e03109855b7245313c760,Snack and the City: How the Vada Pav Has Kept Up with Mumbai's Appetite,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/snack-and-the-city-how-the-vada-pav-has-kept-up-with-mumbai-s-appetite/story-K5JRuEMt00i4iTYqCkD74L.html,2017-04-17,"Its a fairly odd recipe, as recipes go  carbs dipped in more carbs, wrapped in carbs.But thats no accident. The vada pav is the answer to a riddle from the last century: What filling snack can you offer a mill worker with just a few annas and no time to sit and eat?Even before the vada pav, its ingredients  chilli, garlic and potato  were already favourites, says food historian Kurush Dalal. What the stalls of the 1960s did, was take the migrant workers average meal and package it to go. And that just worked. It soon became a hit with students or whoever had little money to spend, but wanted a good snack. It is only later that it has become an identity of Mumbai itself. Now, everyone who comes to Mumbai tries the vada pav, he says.Today, you cant turn a corner without running into fresh, hot vadas served with garlic powder, teekha-meetha chutneys (imli and green chilli), and fried chillies on the side.You already want one, dont you? Chances are youve had at least one in the past month. And it may not have been at a pavement stall either.You can now order Mumbais favourite snack at trendy cafs and casual fine-dining restaurants in the city. Sometimes itll come to you in the form of a slider; other times, its deconstructed.Its a fairly well-travelled little fellow too. You can now get a vada pav in London, New York or Sydney  granted, you will have to ask for the Bombay burger when you order.Its been a symbol, snack and political icon. At each stage of the citys transformation, it has acted as a mirror  going corporate at the turn of the century, saffron in the oughts, and taking to casual fine-dining in the early parts of this decade.Its a migrant too!Interestingly, the vada pavs core ingredients arent really local. The pav is a legacy of the Portuguese; the potato and groundnut came to us from the Americas, also via the Portuguese. The garlic is localand the chickpea batter.Like any good Mumbaiite, the snack is supremely adaptable. Its many things to many people, often at the same time.In 2008, for instance, it became a political statement when the Shiv Sena launched more than 100 Shiv Vada Pav stalls across the city. As Sena legislator Anil Parab puts it, It is a part of Mumbais culture. Several people who had vada pav stalls were Shiv Sena supporters already, so the party felt it would do well for the business and the city to turn it into a brand.These stalls werent the snacks political debut either. Theres a theory that the vada pav has its very roots in the Senas battle to establish a Marathi identity as the basis of Mumbais melting-pot culture.In the 1960s, some Shiv Sena protest signs read Idli dosa bhagao [Stop idli and dosa], referencing the two iconic snack foods of Tamil Nadu, as Sainiks attacked South Indian Udipi restaurants because the party founder, Bal Thackeray, accused south Indians of taking jobs that rightly belonged to the Marathi manoos, says Harris Solomon, a professor of cultural anthropology at Americas Duke University, in a paper titled The Taste No Chef Can Give: Processing Street Food in Mumbai, published in 2015.It was then, as a counter to the increasingly popular idlis and dosas and as a way to promote entrepreneurship, that the party first encouraged Maharashtrians to start their own vada pav stalls.It was about encouraging the Marathi people to turn entrepreneurs instead of hunting for jobs, says Parab.#MumbaiMeriHai What does Mumbai mean to you? Over the next few weeks, we are celebrating our favourite things about the city? We will trace the roots of Mumbais most popular street foods, drop in at its maidans, explore the workings of its stock markets and that grand dream machine that is Bollywood. We would like to hear from you too.Tweet, Istagram your favourite pictures of the city with #MumbaiMeriHai, or write to us at @htmetro@hindustantimes.comPav wowTwo decades on, came the real boost for the vada pav.When the citys textile mills began to close in the 1980s and people needed income, they sold vada pav outside the mills. The rest of the mill workers would pass their former colleagues on the streets selling vada pav, and buy from them, Solomon writes.Then came the post-liberalisation boom. In 2001, Dheeraj Gupta launched Jumbo King Vada Pav, with its first outlet outside Malad railway station.This was followed by trendy kiosk-style outlets with names such as Goli Vada Pav (2004) and Wow Vada Pav (2012).With their shiny clean interiors, quirky combinations and customisable toppings, they soon became popular.All three now have scores of outlets across the country  from Jharkhand to Uttarakhand and Hyderabad to Delhi.Somewhere in Ranchi, then, there is someone eating what started out as a mill workers snack, now available in local flavours  with chhole, for instance, or achari-flavoured.We think of the vada as the ultimate finger food, says Gupta. And weve expanded our menu options accordingly, through the years.That same spirit of experimentation is visible in the khau gallis of Vile Parle, Churchgate and the CST area, where the snack is getting a new avatar all the time.In these parts, you can get a Schezwan vada pav made with Chindian spices; one with dollops of cheese coating the patty; or even a paneer vada pav, in which paneer replaces the potato.Dont expect any of this at the original home of the vada pav, around Dadar railway station.The railways were a lifeline for the mill workers, so it was logical for the earliest stalls to be here, says food historian Kurush Dalal.There is still a stall here that has been around since 1967. I inherited it from my father, Ashok Vaidya, says co-owner Narendra Vaidya. Our stall has a few loyalists, who have been coming here for decades. But, we keep getting new customers. Weve made no changes and have no secret recipe. It just works, and has kept working.The many avatas of the Vada Pav DECONSTRUCTED At Farzi Caf (top) and SpiceKlub, you get potato mousse or patties accompanied by smears or pouches of chutneys, sprinkled with lasoon chutney, sev, fried chillies and curry leaves IN A BAO Casual fine-dine restaurants such as the popular Social chain put the patty in a soft Chinese bun called a bao. Accompaniments include a lehsun chutney mayonnaise. AS A SIZZLER At outlets of Bar Stock Exchange, the vadas come with a side of vegetables, cumin rice and kachumber, topped with AS A SALAD Dishkiyaoon in BKC serves the potato patty comes with salad leaves, pomegranate and a pinch of farsan.Smart casualWith the boom in disposable incomes and the mushrooming of stand-alone restaurants, the vada pav went smart casual.The changing economy changed the way people snacked too, says Mumbai columnist and city chronicler Smruti Koppikar. Street food, which was once for the poor, has now become emblematic of a culture and entered the restaurants. As it travelled indoors from the streets, there has been a transition of the snack too.So you now get the vada in a bao, as a salad, or made with chicken!But these, loyalists like to say, are fads.After all, the mills are gone and soaring glass-and-steel office buildings have taken their place, but the snack of the mill labourer still thrives, in exactly the same form.It must now compete with meals in a box, dosa stalls, street Chinese and packaged snacks. It still wins. Unlike the meal in a box, its cheap. Unlike bhel and chaat, its filling. The packaged snacks arent piping hot. And you cant eat a dosa on the go. As Gresham Fernandes, head chef at Impresario, puts it, When in Mumbai, I still like to have my vada pav on the street.If anything, it feels odd to sit down at a faux Irani caf and order a platter of your favourite street food. Like any true Mumbaiite, the vada pav is at its best under pressure and on the move."

Puran poli (a special dal-stuffed chapatti) with ghee was the delicacy that afternoon.And before that the judges had Rajasthani delicacies from Justice AK Sikris kitchen - bajre ki roti, bajre ki kichidi, dal bati churma and Rajasthani kadi.Vegetables from Justice Kurien Josephs own kitchen garden were used to cook traditional dishes from Kerala such as spicy mushroom laced with gravy, kappa (tapioca), parboiled rice, papad, followed by neatly chopped pineapples. The unusually long ripe bananas from the state were served after the meal.Justice J Chelameswar, who stirred a controversy with his decision to skip collegium meetings, too was a good host when it was his turn. His lunch treat of spicy sambar, rasam, idli, dosa, salt pongal, avakkai (mango pickle) and gongura (sorrel leaf) pachadi left the judges licking their fingers.An unwritten rule is strictly followed at these lunches  only vegetarian cuisine is served to respect the sentiments of those who do not eat non-vegetarian food. The host is selected according to the judges seniority.Justice AK Patnaik, who retired in June 2014, fondly remembers how the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir had added a new rule not to convert the lunch into a competition between judges. He introduced a penalty for those who exceeded the number of dishes fixed by him, Justice Patnaik recalls.Behind every successful meal is a judges wife, a senior judge told HT. But not for Justice R Banumathi  the lone woman judge  who would have to supervise the lunch herself when her turn comes.The Wednesday lunch not only gives judges an opportunity to taste a variety of Indian cuisines, but also shows their bonhomie. Work is never discussed and judges leave their differences at the door. Food is the only topic of discussion with some of the judges boasting about their local cuisines.A senior judge is appointed as the marshall and he penalises any judge who breaks the rules. At present Justice Bobde is the marshall. An argument with the marshall can aggravate the penalty.A marshall is like a class monitor to whom a complaint is made if a judge is seen breaching the rules. He is also the one who announces the end of the dinner that follows a standing ovation for the host judge, a sitting judge told HT on condition of anonymity.Retired judge Justice Kuldeep Singh who suggested the idea of the weekly lunches in the early Nineties gets nostalgic when asked about what triggered the idea. Justice Ranganath Misra was the Chief Justice then and he agreed for the weekly lunch so that we could all get together. It gave a personal touch and became an exciting event which everyone looked forward to, Justice Singh said.It was an opportunity to unwind and relax over food. Therefore, the rule that work should never be discussed. When we left our gowns in the chambers, we also left our work behind. I always looked forward to meals from south, Justice Singh recollects.Justice GS Singvhi who retired three years ago also has fond memories to share. Those were the only moments when we never discussed work. The lunch ensured that we brushed up our knowledge related to food cooked in our houses he told HT.Nor can he forget the south Indian dishes he had at these lunches. Home-made paisam (dessert), rasam and brown rice of Kerala were my favourites. I never eat sweets due to my sugar problem, but I could not resist the home-made paisam served by a brother judge from the south, he says.Yes, it was difficult for judges to avoid home-cooked preparations, despite health issues. When it was my turn I got two types of dessert ready, which included a sugar-free dessert. To my surprise nobody touched the sugar-free sweet and I always thought that judges were too old, muses Justice Patnaik who enjoyed the variety of chutneys his brother judge from the South got for lunch.A judge recollects how Justice Aftab Alam in his farewell speech on April 18, 2013 described the Wednesday lunch as a congregation of mini India. He said the one thing he would miss post retirement would be the weekly lunch, the judge recalls.Former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha holds a similar view. The Supreme Court is a mini India. You have judges from all over the country. The lunch used to a gastronomical delight of regional cuisine, he told HT.Justice Lodha had served dal-bati when it was his turn to host the lunch. It was soaked in ghee and I remember that after the lunch session all the judges felt so sleepy. Justice Singhvi, who also got dal-bati, says his preparation was different from Justice Lodhas family recipe. Dal-bati is cooked differently in the Jodhpur region and in the Jaipur region of Rajasthan. That is the beauty of Indian food, he explains.The lunch is laid out on a large rectangular table presided by the CJI. The host sits on his right and gives a brief introduction about the dishes. The rest sit wherever they like.However, the seating arrangement keeps changing. During former CJI HL Dattus tenure, the judges used to sit around circular tables and places were decided as per the lucky draw. A judge recollects how the present CJI JS Khehar ended up sitting next to Justice Dattu thrice. And when the former CJI asked him what conspiracy he was up to, CJI Khehar said it was the lucky draws fault!"

Trump would not say if he reviewed new intelligence to support his claim.He told the Times he would say more at the right time.I think its going to be the biggest story, Trump said. Its such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time.Rice is the latest target for Trump and his embattled defenders.She has firmly denied that she did anything inappropriate in requesting the identities of Trump associates. As the national security adviser, Rice would have been authorised to seek identities of people whose names were redacted from intelligence reports.Officials typically unmask Americans if it is deemed necessary for understanding the information. Some Trump allies have accused Rice of unmasking officials for political reasons.Absolutely false, Rice said on Tuesday.Former president Barack Obamas national security adviser Susan Rice (Reuters File Photo)Trump on Wednesday disagreed.When the Times asked him if Rice broke the law, he said, Do I think? Yes, I think. The president did not specify what law he thinks Rice may have broken.Erin Pelton, a spokeswoman for Rice, said, I am not going to dignify the presidents ludicrous charge with a comment.Trumps unfounded accusation fits a pattern for the president. Last month, he accused Obama of wiretapping his New York skyscraper and later said Obama had spied on his campaign. Neither allegation has been backed up by evidence.Trumps first national security adviser Michael Flynn is under FBI scrutiny for his ties to Russia. Two congressional committees are also investigating Flynn as part of larger probes into the Kremlins influence on the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates.Last week Trump said Flynn, who resigned in February, should seek an immunity deal.On Wednesday, House speaker Paul Ryan said the House intelligence committee investigation looking into Russias role in the 2016 election was back on track after the committees chairman had a secret meeting on White House grounds about intelligence that Trump later said vindicated his Obama wiretapping claims.A congressional aide said the documents are being made available for all committee members to view at the White House.Also, Republicans and Democrats have agreed on the witnesses to be called, Ryan said.Representative Jim Himes, D-Conn, a member of the committee, told CNN that Rice is on the witness list. A congressional aide said there were more than a dozen people on the list.According to a US official, Rice asked spy agencies to give her the names of Trump associates who surfaced in intelligence reports she was regularly briefed on. Rices official role would have given her the ability to make those requests for national security purposes.In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, Rice acknowledged that she sometimes asked for the names of Americans referenced in reports.She would not say whether she saw intelligence related to Trump associates or whether she asked for their identities, though she did say that reports related to Russia increased in the final months of the presidential election campaign.The Trump White House has been particularly incensed that intercepted conversations between Flynn and Russias ambassador to the US surfaced in news reports before the inauguration.Rice denied that she had leaked details about Flynns call, saying, I leaked nothing to nobody."

The number of sacrifices swells on Navami and Dashami during Navratri. Over 500 goats each are sacrificed on Navami and Dashami alone.The meat is distributed as prasad (consecrated food) to the faithful who cook it in earthen pots and enjoy a feast on the temple premises. The animal waste is buried.Tarkulha is one of the several manifestations of Goddess Durga. The deity derives the name Tarkulha Devi from the tarkul (palm) tree.The entire year, people visit the temple to offer sacrifice when their wishes are fulfilled. But the number increases during Navratri, said Dinesh Tiwari, priest at the Tarkulha Devi temple.Those who dont wish to sacrifice animals offer coconuts to the goddess, he said.The tradition here is in contrast to the practice in most Hindu temples where coconuts, sweets and lemon rice are distributed as prasad.Normally, Navratra is a period during which Hindus avoid consuming non-vegetarian food.Devotees from far-flung areas, including Bihar and Nepal, visit the temple and offer animal sacrifice to appease the deity. Most devotees bring the goats with them. Others buy the animal from shops outside the temple for Rs 2,500 or more.After the animal is bathed and sweets are offered to it, a butcher severs its head in a single stroke.It is a long-standing tradition. The devotees, whose wishes are fulfilled, sacrifice the goats and distribute its meat as prasad, said Manohar Tripathi, a devotee associated with the temple .The tradition and the history of the temple can be traced to the British era when Bandhu Singh , a devotee of Tarkulha, was hanged by the British who found him guilty of killing their soldiers.Bandhu Singh used to sacrifice animals and offer heads of the British at the feet of Devi, said Dinesh Tiwari.Bandhu Singh, adept in guerilla warfare, used to worship Goddess Tarkulha under a tarkul (tree along the Gurra river, which used to flow through a dense forest, said Dr PK Lahiri, member of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural heritage (Intach).Bandhu Singh used to sacrifice the animal to please the goddess and the practice continues, Lahiri said.Bandhu Singh beheaded the British when they crossed the forest.When senior British officials came to know about this, they caught him. A court sentenced him to death.The British tried to hang him thrice but failed.The fourth time, he prayed to the goddess for salvation, saying he was in extreme pain, and his prayer was answered.Finally, he was publicly executed at Alinagar crossing on August 12, 1857.Every time, the noose was placed around his neck and the lever was pulled, the rope broke and he escaped miraculously till he was finally executed. It is said that at the time of Bandu Singhs execution, a thunderstorm hit the area. The branch of a Tarkul tree, where he used to worship the goddess, broke and blood started oozing out of it, Lahiri told HT.From then on, people began worshipping Tarkulha Devi. They started offering sacrifices the same way Bandhu Singh did when he was alive."

However, muted average realisations are expected to keep the value of these exports to under Rs 21,000 crore, against Rs 22,718 crore in FY16, said ICRA assistant vice-president Deepak Jotwani.This is likely to push up Basmati rice prices in the next fiscal, he said.Resumption of imports by Iran will be keenly watched by the industry as it has the potential to provide an impetus to exports, he added.Going forward, the coming financial year is expected to witness better revenue growth supported by a rise in average realisations, as paddy prices firm up during the current procurement season. Moreover, resumption of imports by Iran will also be crucial for driving industry growth in the next fiscal, Jotwani said.The basmati rice industry witnessed moderation over the last few years on the back of subdued international demand, partly attributable to the delay in resumption of imports by Iran.However, 2016-17 has seen some stabilisation in demand, ICRA said, adding after peaking at Rs 29,300 crore in FY14, the value of basmati rice exports went on a downward trajectory.While volumes saw some growth over the last few years, the decline in value is primarily owing to continued pressure on average realisations (declined from a high of Rs 77,988 per tonne in FY14 to Rs 56,149 per tonne in FY16) in the light of moderation in demand in the global market, ICRA said.Nevertheless, the export volumes in the current fiscal have largely been in line with last year, being supported by the increasing domestic demand for basmati rice, the report added.It said, the industry has registered milling gains on paddy procured at a fairly low rate in the last procurement season and favourable foreign exchange rate movement.For the next fiscal, the industry is expected to benefit from the rising paddy prices, ICRA said.After declining considerably during the procurement season in FY16, basmati paddy prices have firmed up by 20-25 per cent across various varieties, primarily due to the relatively lower production, in the recent procurement season - October to December 2016, the agency noted."

It remains common among Muslim families even in Jakarta, although doctors there typically carry out a less extreme form of the procedure that involves pricking the clitoral hood with a needle.In an effort to accommodate cultural and religious considerations, the government has moved away from previous attempts to ban the practice entirely and has instead sought to stamp out the more harmful methods and ensure safety.Authorities insist the methods most commonly used in Indonesia -- usually involving a pin prick -- do not amount to female genital mutilation.The methods used in Indonesia are generally less harsh than the most brutal forms of FGM found mainly in African and Middle Eastern countries, that can go as far as total removal of the clitoris.Read: Female circumcision: A cruel practice that numbs womens sexual pleasureThe UN, however, disagrees with the Indonesian governments stance, classifying FGM among harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes and has passed two resolutions aimed at stopping it worldwide in recent years.The global body says FGM has no health benefits and can cause many problems, such as infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications.Not in KoranDebate within Indonesia has been heating up in recent times, with activists and even a major Muslim organisation arguing against female circumcision, saying it violates a womans right to do as she wishes with her body.I believe there are no verses in my religion that allow female circumcision -- it is not in the Koran, Khorirah Ali, a member of the government-backed national commission on violence against women, said.The countrys second-biggest Muslim organisation, Muhammadiyah, discourages its followers from partaking in circumcision but the largest, Nahdlatul Ulama, and the countrys top Islamic authority the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) is still in favour.The issue is a hot potato and the government has flip-flopped in recent years.Also read: Over 800 girls circumcised in Tanzania despite govt crackdown on FGMIn 2006, the health ministry banned doctors from carrying out female circumcision, saying there was no medical benefit -- but the MUI hit back with a fatwa saying that women who undergo the procedure would be considered noble.The government backtracked several years later and said licensed medics could conduct the procedure as long as it was only scratching the clitoral hood, only to later void this measure in favour of asking a specially appointed council to issue safety guidelines.Campaigners say the constant changes have created confusion about what is allowed and more harmful practices -- such as those used in Gorontalo -- continue to exist.Despite the opposition, the practice is unlikely to end soon in the country of 255 million people.Jurnalis Uddin, an expert on female circumcision from Jakarta-based Yarsi University, and a member of the governments advisory council, said the focus should be on encouraging the less harmful methods.To get rid of the practice completely is like swimming against the current, he said."

Several countries have implemented GST or another form of a value-added tax, but Canada is the closest to India with a dual structure.The new indirect tax is expected to shore up government revenue and spur economic growth by 1-2 percentage points.Four-slab GST structure The new regime will have four slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. There will be no tax on essential items such as rice and wheat. The lowest tax rate of 5% is proposed for items of mass consumption such as spices, tea and edible oil. There will be two standard rates of 12% and 18% covering most manufactured items and services. The highest tax, of 28%, will be imposed on items such as luxury cars, pan masala, tobacco and aerated drinks.Compensation to states The compensation bill that was passed on Wednesday will ensure states get compensated for the first five years for the revenue loss after the GST rollout. The money will come from a fund created from the cess the Centre will charge on certain goods, above the GST rate.Dual control on taxpayers The Centre and states will both assess taxpayers with an annual turnover of above Rs 1.5 crore. States will also have the power to assess taxpayers with a turnover below Rs 1.5 crore.Exemption from GST In Northeastern states, businesses with an annual turnover of Rs 10 lakh or below will be exempt from GST. For the rest of India, the limit is Rs 20 lakh."

(Sunil Ghosh/HT)Mohammad Shakeel, 51, said he has seen such an implementation for the first time in his 10 years of business. He said prices will rise further since most slaughterhouses in the city have been closed.Earlier, meat was supplied to us from the interior parts of the city also. But that has stopped since the crackdown launched by state government on illegal slaughterhouses. Now traders from Delhi up to Meerut are dependent on Ghazipur only, he said.The chicken biryani is sold at a price of Rs 160 per kg at all locations, while the raw chicken used for its preparation is now being sold at Rs 200 per kg as against Rs 150 per kg prior to the crackdown on slaughterhouses.There is a rise of Rs 50 per kg in raw chicken price but the biryani is still being sold at Rs 160 per kg, the traders said.Until now, since meat was available at cheaper prices, vendors used to sell biryani from morning till evening. Now, after the crackdown, most vendors do business only half the day.The crackdown was one of the first decisions taken by Yogi Adityanath, who took over as the UP chief minister on March 19, after the BJP swept the state election.Vendors who used to run biryani kiosks are most affected and many have shut shop.We used to get chicken supply from the shops that have been closed now. With raw chicken becoming costlier, we are staring at a closure of shops, said Din Mohammad, a vendor."

Having spent almost his entire life outside the state, Naveen did not know anyone when he came to Odisha.During Biju Patnaiks tenure as chief minister between 1990 and 1995, Mohapatra worked as his principal secretary and was the eyes and ears of the legendary politician. With virtually no friends in Odisha, Naveen turned to his mother Gyan Patnaik, who advised him to seek the help of Pyari babu to navigate the choppy waters of politics.Mohapatra paved the way for Naveens smooth ascension to the throne in 2000 when he engineered the expulsion and subsequent political checkmating of Bijoy Mohapatra, the chairman of BJDs political affairs committee shortly before the assembly elections. The canny Mohapatra saw Bijoy Mohapatra as the main adversary of Naveen in the fledgling BJD and ensured that he did not get to contest the polls. It is PM who has stabbed me, said Bijoy at a public meeting in his constituency in Kendrapara district referring to Mohapatra.From early 2000, Mohapatra scripted almost all the moves of Naveen, including advising him on day-to-day running of the state. Naveen, a political greenhorn, depended on uncle Mohapatra and suggested his bureaucrats and ministers to often consult the retired bureaucrat on policy matters and politics.Mohapatra soon acquired a larger-than-life image in the party with bureaucrats queuing up before his house for orders on some policy issues.The BJP was an ally of BJD, but Pyari Mohan Mohapatra convinced Naveen to dump it just ahead of the 2009 assembly polls citing that the saffron partner had become a political liability in the wake of Kandhamal riots in 2008. (Arabinda Mahapatra/HT File Photo)Over time, the bespectacled Mohapatra, calculated each and every moves of moves of Naveen like a consummate chess player. More than Naveen Niwas, the residence of the chief minister, Mohapatras residence at 111 Sahid Nagar in Bhubaneswar was where the levers of power were being turned. He was dubbed as super chief minister and Chanakya of Odisha politics. What Amit Shah is to (Narendra) Modi, Pyari babu was to Naveen. He changed the DNA of BJD and made it a politically well-oiled winning machine, said political analyst Rabi Das.A grateful Naveen sent Mohapatra to Rajya Sabha in 2004. The Bharatiya Janata Party was an ally of BJD, but Mohapatra convinced Naveen to dump it just ahead of the 2009 assembly polls citing that the saffron partner had become a political liability in the wake of Kandhamal riots in 2008.While everyone said the move was suicidal, Mohapatra helped the BJD win 109 of the 147 seats in the assembly.Using a cheap rice scheme for the poor and through some deft selection of candidates, he managed to break the Congress and BJP bastion in the tribal districts of undivided Koraput, Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Sundargarh. He even propped up candidates in places where BJD candidates were on a weak wicket to ensure they eat into the rivals votes.But post-2009 polls, the bond between the two men showed signs of cracks as Mohapatra tried to assert himself as the most important leader of the party but Naveen asked his bureaucrats not to report to his political advisor. The frigidity in the realtionship was evident in 2012 panchayat polls when Naveen campaigned alone in the panchayat elections and then unilaterally announced the names of three Rajya Sabha candidates without even a phonecall to Mohapatra. To rub more salt into Mohapatras wounds, Naveen unilaterally announced BJDs support for former Lok Sabha Speaker PA Sangma as presidential candidate.Mohapatra fell from grace on May 29, 2012 when he allegedly tried to engineer a coup in the party while Naveen was away in London on his first overseas trip after becoming CM. Naveen was furious when he learnt of the coup attempt and tried to mock Mohapatra for acting like his self-appointed advisor.The rebellion fell through as just 33 of the 104 MLAs of the party showed allegiance to the Chanakya. Soon after Naveen returned from London, the smoulders of rebellion had died as Mohapatra realised his disciple had outwitted him in politics. He is a beimaan and backstabber, said Naveen, soon after suspending Mohapatra and a few others from the party.Mohapatra swore revenge promising that he would reveal explosive details about Naveen when the time comes. But his threat had no effect and his party, Odisha Jana Morcha, bit the dust in 2014 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. He receded to further political oblivion last year when his Rajya Sabha tenure ended.In between a few political leaders, including union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, visited him after he was diagnosed with lung cancer."

The court had reserved its judgment in the case on February 20.The petitioners alleged that since a state cabinet minister and an MP of the ruling party were allegedly involved in the case, the matter should be handed over to the CBI for a fair probe.The petitioner had alleged that there was a deeper conspiracy behind the incident as reflected in the fact that Jawahar Bagh, where demonstrations are not allowed, was given to Ram Vriksha Yadav for holding a satyagrah in 2014.The sect members had taken over the park gradually since 2014, turning it into a self-sufficient residential colony which had its own vegetable gardens and grocery shops. The sect even has its own tractors to ferry rice and other goods for the families.Most of the families in the park were from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal.The incident had sparked a political blame game with the opposition attacking the government for a massive intelligence failure.

The Afghan national, Abdul Ali Noori, was admitted to the hospital by a relative and a guide.By Thursday afternoon, doctors extracted plastic pouches carrying poisonous substance from the patients stomach. The police and narcotics officers also arrived on the scene and identified the substance as heroin.The narcotics team collected the samples. Prima facie, it appears that the patient was carrying heroin packed in capsules that are five centimetres each in size, Vinay Prakash Singh, station house officer of Sector 24 police station, said.Noori, a native of Kandahar in Afghanistan, was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday night in an unconscious state by his relative and local guide-cum-translator. Noori is still unconscious and the hospital claims that they are operating on the patient as some of the pouches had burst inside his stomach.Noori has a history of loss of consciousness and was accompanied by a relative and a guide. However, he did not mention any local address and only submitted his passport, Chhaya Malhotra, spokesperson, Metro Hospital, said.As Noori was in a critical condition, the doctors admitted him to the intensive care unit and carried out a computed tomography (CT) scan on Wednesday morning.The CT scan of the abdomen showed multiple foreign bodies. We also carried out an upper GI endoscopy, which revealed multiple white cylindrical foreign bodies wrapped in plastic. Some of them possibly burst inside as we can also see swollen rice material, Dr Atul Sharma, gastroenterologist, Metro Hospital, said.Doctors said that Noori must have consumed the pouches orally as no operation marks were seen on his body.The police have deployed personnel at the hospital and held his relative and translator for further investigation. It is likely that Noori will be arrested if and when he gains consciousness.Police will decide further course of action once the Narcotics team confirms that the substance was contraband. Till then an investigation is going on, Singh said.However, Noori is a critical state and doctors said that they are trying to save his life. Repeat endoscopy or surgery might be done to remove the remaining bags from the stomach, Dr Sharma said.Many details about Noori and the events leading to his admission remain unclear."

Few would have cared for these elections but for the big surprise sprung by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Coming from nowhere, Prime Minister Narendra Modis party has won more than 190 seats, or 35%, of 538 seats that have so far polled, and the winning ratio keeps getting better with each round, according to unofficial results. If this trend continues, the BJP will end up winning more than 300 of the 854 zilla parishad seats  almost a 10-fold increase over the 36 seats the party won in 2012 when these elections were last held.It is a phenomenal feat for a party that has never been a force to reckon with in Odisha politics, which often revolved around two centrist parties  the Congress and the ruling Biju Janata Dal of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. That is why Modi was quick to react. He spoke about the results at a campaign rally in Uttar Pradesh and then tweeted to congratulate his party colleagues in Odisha for the good work done.Naveens BJD will still win the most number of seats, but it will have little to celebrate -- because the lead will be so narrow and the message from the voters so unnerving. Also, the effective opposition space in the state will now be taken by a party that rules at the Centre and sets the political agenda for the nation. The outcome of the panchayat elections will shape the course of the states politics between now and 2019 when Odisha holds assembly polls simultaneously with parliamentary elections.Read | BJP upbeat, Congress worried: Whats happening in Odisha panchayat electionsNaveen loses TINA card: One message that rings out loud and clear is that Naveen Patnaik is no more invincible, no more infallible; that the voters of Odisha no longer believe there is no alternative (TINA) to his Biju Janata Dal.A political outsider who was thrust into Odisha politics after his father Biju Patnaik -- a legendary politician and a folk hero  died in 1997, Naveen has never been out of power since winning the state in 2000. His lineage, his image of being not a run-of-the-mill politician and a bachelor with no temptation to hoard wealth made the people of Odisha swoon over him. He came on the political stage at a time when the Congress party, discredited by decades of misrule, had turned rudderless. The lack of an effective opposition meant Naveen had everything going for him to consolidate his power, both within and outside the party.Also, a good part of Naveens tenure overlapped with Indias economic rise and a mining boom in Odisha, which meant more money  by way of both higher central transfers and the states own revenues -- for vote-winning welfare programmes such as offering rice to the poor for Rs 2 per kg (later reduced to Re 1/kg) and building rural roads. In cities, the middle class was happy as the service sector was on an upswing. Information technology companies such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services set up large operations in the states capital, Bhubaneswar, creating lucrative jobs for the local educated youth  many of them have since risen through the ranks to take up US and Europe-based assignments for their employers. The expansion of the IT sector coupled with dodgy money from mining also fueled a realty boom that hugely benefited people living in the urbanizing landscape around the states capital and other cities.All of these kept reinforcing the image of Naveen Patnaik as a leader who stood for development and progress, even though his populist schemes came at the expense of longer-term welfare of the people. Critical sectors such as education and healthcare were neglected, as was investment in agriculture that provides livelihood to more than three-quarters of the states population. No one questioned or challenged Naveen, because there was no one to do so. The results of the panchayat elections suggest that may no longer be the case.In the simmering discontent over unfulfilled aspirations and the growing clamour for an alternative to the current dispensation, the BJP seems to have spotted an opportunity.Read | Odisha panchayat elections: CM Patnaik losing grip? Rise of BJP worries CongressNot a flash in the pan: Since Prime Minister Modi came to power in 2014, the BJP has assiduously worked to expand its footprint in Odisha. Rarely a month has passed without a central minister visiting the state. As PM, Modi has gone there four times.The narrative built through these visits goes something like this: the BJP cares for Odisha; money for Naveens welfare schemes come from the Centre; and the state has very little to show for his 17 years in power.The success in the panchayat polls shows the strategy has worked and the BJP has been able to build a well-entrenched organisation at the grassroots. Its ambitions have been helped by a steady disintegration of the Congress party, which has now been pushed to the margins of Odisha politics -- thanks to the lack of a leader who can steer the partys local unit. The whimsical decisions of the central leadership of the Congress in choosing local leaders and frequently changing them have only made it worse for the party, which once ruled the state with a brute majority. I will keep it for a later date to elaborate on this.For now, the BJP has effectively snatched the opposition space from Congress. The assembly elections in the state may be two years away, but Naveen already has a fight on his hands.(An abridged version of this article appeared in Hindustan Times on February 19)Click here for full coverage on assembly elections 2017"
