Ask Those Who Voted for Modi",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-are-the-achhe-din-ask-those-who-voted-for-modi/story-zSkharcZSfHdLRtDtwd5UJ.html,2017-02-05,"Rocking the youngest of his five children in his arms, street vendor Daata Ram watches his wife tend to two sick cows whose milk once supplemented their meagre income.The 66-year-olds family of seven survives on what he now makes by selling small quantities of puffed rice in Pandra Sikanpur, a one-street, hardscrabble town of 5,000 in Uttar Pradesh.I took a loan of Rs 30,000 to buy those cows but I think they are no good now, says Ram, who uses a fourth of his monthly earnings of Rs5000-6000 to repay the local moneylender.Across the street from Rams thatched hut is the sprawling house of Neeraj Kumar Singh, a well-off sugarcane farmer who lost multiple crops to back-to-back droughts three years ago, and then suffered when farm prices crashed last year.It takes two harvesting seasons to recover the loss of one, says Singh who wants his sons to find jobs outside farming so that their lives wouldnt be held ransom to the vagaries of nature.But his four children have found no jobs, and the 60-year-old farmer is angry that he must now divide his 10 acres of cropland to secure their future.Daata Ram and Singh sit on different points on the countrys income spectrum but, in their collective discontent, the two symbolise the rising pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliver on his emotive election vow to bring achhe din, or good times, to Indians.The Feb. 1 budget was a chance for Modi to unveil measures that would fulfil his 2014 guarantee of growth and more jobs, a task made all the more tough by his abrupt decision to drain out 86% of all cash in the economy in his fight against illicit wealth.Its also a challenge that is urgent, given that Modi has already crossed the halfway point of his tenure.Read | Budget 2017: Akhilesh says BJP could not fulfil promise of achhe dinTo his admirers, though, Modi has already made great strides  from reinvigorating the ossified hand of a government system that hobbled progress to biting the bullet on tough decisions needed to pull Indias economy out of a dangerous morass.Many of his moves on inclusive, accountable governance and a freer hand to bureaucracy have resonated well with Indians tired of a rudderless government mired in corruption scandals and whose indecisiveness had left more than 700 major industry projects in limbo.Rambir Rathi , a Uttar Pradesh farmer at home (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)Growing economySome of that good work is showing.The countrys annualised retail inflation is below the mid-point of the central banks target; public finances are better than before with higher income from taxes, monsoon-sown grain production is the highest in at least 14 years and the economy is more open to business than it has ever been. In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much. I dont feel like giving him even one), he says, adding Modi had only done well on dealing with Pakistan.But farms in distressWith mounting debt, poverty, increasing health cost and other ballooning farming-related expenses, farm incomes dropped 50%-70% over the past years. And just farmers hoped to claw back from two years of back-to-back drought, the government ordered a disruptive currency ban that squeezed the largely cash-only agriculture sector.Farm prices crashed as farmers dumped tomatoes and potatoes onto the streets, fed unharvested crop to cattle and farm hands sat idle. A farm loan write-off for two months after demonetisation hardly helped, some economists say.Februarys budget raised the farm credit target to by 11.1% to Rs 10-lakh crore in 2017-18 but, in reality, bank lending to farmers has dropped and the distribution of credit has focussed on a handful of relatively better-off states.Expenditure on agriculture is seen rising marginally to Rs 2.06-lakh crore in 2017/18, but this in real terms might signal a decline.Fewer jobsSigns of distress are clear in cities as well. Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Modis popularity among the relatively well-off.Today, India stands before a unique moment in history: It could choose to squander its immense potential with its antiquated socio-political system, corruption and flighty business rules or build on its cultural heritage, democratic values and a young demography to transform the lives of its 1.25 billion citizens.To begin with, two decades on, nothing less than a $10 trillion economy will secure Indias future, says a recent study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers( PwC). It will have to create jobs on a scale that can absorb 10-12 million people who join the workforce every year, including members of the emerging middle class  a billion strong by 2034.Read | Achhe din will come only after 2019, Cong working on it: Rahul GandhiBut only 135,000 jobs were created in 2015 -- the lowest total in seven years and 67% lower than the number created in the last year of the previous government. In one quarter of 2016-17, for which official data is available, only 77,000 jobs were created  and of these 50,000 were government jobs.The gloom is affecting the youth.Chartered accountant Omprakash Sethia in Bhopal. (Mujeeb Faruqui/HT PHOTO)Nothing has changed. It seems there is nobody to follow Modijis principles of hard work and integrity. Corruption is rampant . It seems there is no monitoring system in the country. I am hugely disappointed, says Omprakash Sethia of Bhopal.I thought there would be a boom on the job front but despite emphasis on digital India I dont see many job avenues, says Subhanshu Sethia, a commerce student in Bhopal.The demonetisation move worsened the plight of the vulnerably placed in the labour market in several ways, the most stress arising out of closure of establishments in the informal sector.Back in Pandra Sikanpur, Singh says he will think twice about voting for Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the next general elections scheduled for 2019.That view is far from universal, but is already on the radar of a government, which swept to power with promises of economic reforms and pro-business policies that appealed to aspirational Indians living in big towns and cities.Modi has already started turning his attention to the hinterlands. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this month said the government will spend a record amount on rural areas and farming to help double farmers income by 2022.But Singh is unimpressed.Narendra Modi stressed on jobs during his speeches in general election. Where are those jobs? he asks.I know how I feel is how many many more Indians feel.(With inputs from Ranjan Srivastava and Sumanta Ray Chaudhuri)"

All were accused of playing a role in the procurement and supply of sub-standard paddy.Earlier this month, Congress party announced Mangat Rai Bansals wife, Manju Bansal as its candidate from Mansa seat. Since the ticket announcement, Manju Bansal has been facing protest from the local leaders during her campaign.However on Tuesday, Captain shared the stage with Mangat Rai Bansal and took pot shots at the SAD-BJP regime and Aam Admi Party.Rubbishing the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) poll manifesto as a bunch of lies aimed at misleading the people, Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said, Badals have failed to implement even 20% of the promises they made during the last elections. Were they sleeping all these years, rejecting their offer of farm loan waiver as a mere gimmick with an eye on the polls and reiterating the Congress commitment to take over all the loans of the debt-ridden farmers and agricultural labourers immediately after assuming power in the state.What stopped them from working in the interest of the people all these years? Or were they too busy filling their own coffers to think about the welfare of the people? Captain Amarinder asked.The Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president alleged that neither the Akalis nor the AAP were interested in the welfare of the people of Punjab. Describing Kejriwal as a smooth and slimy operator, Captain Amarinder said the bribery and sex scandals involving AAP leaders and workers had made a mockery of his claims of providing clean and transparent governance. With all Punjabs disputes with Haryana, how can a Haryanvi be trusted to stand by the people of Punjab, asked Captain Amarinder.The PPCC president also hit out at Badal over the CIA report linking him with terrorism in Punjab and also assailed him for the growing intolerance in the state, as manifest in the increasing incidents of sacrilege.Two rebel candidatesGurpreet Kaur Gagowal and Gurpreet Singh Vickyskipped the rally in Mansa. Both the leaders withdrew their nomination papers, however they had maintained that no support will be extended to Manju Bansal. When contacted Gurpreet Singh Vicky said he was not invited for the rally."

5b2e1b759855b74d9fcd3942,BJD paddy price jab at Centre,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/odisha/bjd-paddy-price-jab-at-centre-188096?ref=odisha-new-stry,2017-11-23,"Our CorrespondentBhubaneswar: The BJD on Wednesday stepped up its campaign against the Centre for not hiking the minimum support price (MSP) for paddy and criticised the Union agriculture deputy economic adviser's rejection of Odisha's demand in this regard.Addressing a news conference here, BJD leaders - including MLAs Sanjay Dasburma and Rohit Pujari - alleged that the Centre's apathetic attitude towards farmers would no longer be tolerated.Dasburma said: ""The Assembly has passed a unanimous resolution to enhance the MSP to Rs 2,930 per quintal. Even the House committee of the Assembly has sought an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But it is unfortunate that the Prime Minister is not listening to the plights of the farmers.""On November 4, it was decided that Speaker Pradeep Amat would write a letter to the Prime Minister seeking an appointment to discuss the issue. The House committee had subsequently sought appointments with Modi twice without any success.Das Burma said: ""At this point, the Union agriculture ministry's letter not to hike the MSP adds insult to the state's injury. It clearly shows they have abandoned the farmers of the state. When the state is passing through a difficult time with pest attack on crops, the Centre's decision not to hike the MSP is really unfortunate.""In June, the government of India had enhanced the MSP of paddy from Rs 1,470 to Rs 1,550 per quintal for 2017-18. However, the Odisha government termed it as ""disappointing"". The BJD demanded that the centre should implement the Swaminathan Commission Report without any delay. The report recommends that support price be enhanced by one-and-a half time more than the cultivation cost of paddy as the inputs cost has gone up considerably.However, the BJP state unit hit back saying that the Odisha government had announced to give Rs 100 as bonus in addition to the price of paddy to the farmers during the procurement of paddy. ""Chief minister Naveen Patnaik's announcement is yet to be done,"" said BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma, while pointing out that other states have made similar provisions for the farmers.In another development, farmers under the banner of the Zilla Krushak Mahasangh on Wednesday staged a demonstration before Balangir District Civil Supplies Office demanding immediate setting up of rice mandis in the district. ""In the absence of mandis, farmers are getting exploited at the hands of middlemen and do not get proper prices for their paddy,"" alleged Mahasangh president Sudhir Parichha."

The petition, filed on November 13, has sought direction to the state government to submit details of the landed and encroached properties of the lord.It is yet to be taken up for hearing.On March 15, the high court had registered a PIL taking cognisance of a letter petition which had appealed to the chief justice to take judicial measure to prevent valuable immovable properties of Lord Jagannath from being ""acquired by land grabbers in different parts of Odisha and in other parts of the country"".Susil Kumar Mohapatra, the author of Puri Jagannath Temple Manual, who is also an advocate of the high court, had filed the letter petition. The court had then issued notices to the state government seeking a reply to the PIL. But the case has since languished.Lord Jagannath of the 12th century temple in Puri is listed as a landlord in the Odisha government's revenue records. According to official records, he owns 56,000 acres, of which at least 25,711 acres is registered in the name of ""Sri Jagannath Mahaprabhu Bije, Puri"" in the state's land revenue records.The temple's managing committee, headed by the Puri King, manages the land on behalf of the deity. The patches of land are spread over 23 of the 30 districts in the state as well as other states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. But more than 20 per cent of the land had been reportedly encroached upon by land mafia and influential persons.Revenue officials said the Shri Jagannath Temple Act, 1954, prohibits transfer of immovable property recorded in the name of Lord Jagannath of Puri to the name of any person or institution. As per the Shri Jagannath Temple Act, 1954, the provisions of the Odisha Hindu Religious Endowments Act are not applicable to the Puri Jagannath Temple for such transfers.""But the encroachers were managing to hold on to Lord Jagannath's land taking the plea of authorisation by the endowment commissioner under the Odisha Hindu Religious Endowments Act,"" said a senior official on condition of anonymity.Official sources said the last major drive to clear encroachment from Puri Lord Jagannath's land in the state was undertaken in 2013.The temple administration cleared 250 acres in Jatni near Khurda and Delang in Puri district. The value of the recovered land was estimated at Rs 500 crores. Rice processing mill, housing society, market complex and several dhabas had come up on Lord Jagannath's land in these two areas."

After all, its the only place on earth where the 65-year-old farmer from Ahatguri isnt judged on the basis of the money he has.On Friday, Das exchanged fish from his pond for a few bags of turmeric and ginger at the fair. Renumai Devi (57), who took the fish off his hands, was happy she didnt have to haggle over petty change for once.In a demonetised age where cashless transactions are being projected as the countrys stepping stones to a brighter future, the Jonbeel Mela  arguably Indias only fair that works on the barter system  comes as a veritable blast from the past. To be specific, the 15th century.The three-day fair, organised by the Tiwa community at Dayang Belguri in Morigaon district for over five centuries, witnesses the exchange of goods between tribes from the hills and plains of Assam as well as Meghalaya. Tribal people from the hills come down on the invitation of Tiwa king Gova Roja, and exchange their produce with people from the plains, said Jursing Bordoloi, secretary of the Gova Deuraja Jonbeel Mela Development Samiti.Exchange of goods takes place on the second day of the fair. Nearly 40,000 people participated in the fair this year, and transactions amounting to over Rs 1 crore were made.I exchanged beaten rice and rice flour for ginger and turmeric! exclaimed Amiyo Deka of Khusunagug village in Morigaon. Her customer, Riliang Umbah from Ri-Bhoi district of Meghalaya, was happy with the transaction too.Most hill folks brought items like ginger, turmeric, black pepper, cinnamon and yam, which were exchanged for beaten rice, rice flour, fish and traditional sweets from their counterparts on the plains. As was the practice in the old days, items were sold without the use of weighing scales. Measurements were made with bowls and hands, and both parties decided how much each should get.Besides trade, Jonbeel Mela is also known for promoting friendship and harmony among tribes in the region. Every participant addresses the other as mama or mami (maternal uncle or aunt). The bonhomie only grows as tribal families stay on for days at the venue of the fair, a paddy field.Community fishing at the nearby Jonbeel (the wetland after which the fair is named), cockfights, cultural shows, community feasts and token collection of taxes by Gova Roja and his courtiers are other highlights of the fair.We spend nearly Rs 20 lakh to organise the fair. Though 30-35 acres of land is needed to accommodate everybody, none of it is ours, said Jursing Bordoloi, secretary of Junbeel Mela organising committee.Jonbeel Mela attracts thousands of tourists each year, and organisers hope chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal  who will drop by on Saturday  provides financial aid and allots a permanent site for the fair."

Shekhawat, who visited the affected areas in Bargarh, Boudh and Sonepur districts and met the family members of Brunda Sahu, the Bargarh farmer who had committed suicide on November 1, said he was astonished to find that farmers, whose crops had been affected by brown plant hopper had used thimet, a pesticide which helped the proliferation of these pests instead of killing them. ""This pesticide helps increase brown plant hopper pest instead of curbing them,"" he said.He also said the state government had ignored the advisory of Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI). He said: ""I have discussed the matter with CRRI officials. They told me that they had issued four advisories to the state but the government ignored it.""The minister visited the house of Brunda Sahu at Kalapani village and assured his family help under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Yojana.BJD returned Shekhawat's fire with party leader Subash Singh pooh-poohing Shekh-awat's claims about the use of incorrect pesticides by farmers saying that he was no expert to speak on the issue.On being asked about Shekhawat's meeting with the family members of Brunda Sahu, state agriculture minister Damodar Rout said sarcastically that he may have gone there because they were his party members.

Pradhan earned the wrath of Rout and the BJD after he met Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh on Thursday, and later, the duo made disparaging remarks against the state.Singh had accused the state of ignoring the advisory issued by the Central Rice Research Institute about a possible pest attack. ""If he is so much concerned about the farmers, he should have raised the issue with chief minister Naveen Patnaik and with me as well. Instead of doing so, it's not proper on his part to target the state government always from Delhi. All should remember that agriculture is a state subject, and the state government is well aware of its constitutional duty.""BJD spokesperson Pratap Deb said: ""For the past three-and-a-half years, we have been witnessing a drama. Union minister Pradhan will raise the issue and later a team will come. The other ministers will pass odd remarks against the state government. This drama should stop.""A central team, led by Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers welfare Gajendra Singh, would visit the state on Sunday to assess the crop loss caused due to pest attack.In a related development, the state government on Friday announced Rs 137.51 crore towards agriculture input subsidy for the pest-affected crops. Nearly 1.28 lakh hectares were affected by the pest attack. According to the announcement, farmers would get agriculture input subsidy of Rs 6,800 per hectare for rain-fed areas, while those farmers, who have lost more than 33 per cent of their crops, would avail themselves of the benefits.The special relief commissioner's office said that 24 out of 30 districts had reported crop damage due to pest attack except Balasore, Cuttack, Jagatsingpur, Kandhamal, Kendrapada and Malkanagiri.However, another possible rain in next week from November 13 has raised the alarm.

Starting as an independent, he has been in RJD, Samajwadi Party, BSP and now, the JD (U).Dadan has been embroiled in several controversies over the years. He was once accused of forcibly occupying a government bungalow in Patna. He again hit controversy when he got a gigantic statute of the legendary wrestler Mahabali Vir Lorik Ahir installed on the premises of his official bungalow in Patna.Dadan is now in the news because the Bank of India (BoI) has attached the landed assets as well as defunct rice mill belonging to him and his son Kartar Singh, for defaulting on the repayment of a loan taken by son Kartar in which father Dadan was the guarantor.The MLAs son had taken loan from the bank for setting up the rice mill.The properties seized included the rice mill at Dumraon (Buxar) and one and a half katha of land at Saguna Mor in Danapur, which will be auctioned by the bank soon.The loan amount with interest accrued on it has gone up to Rs 1.5 crore.The Dumraon MLA, while confirming the seizure of land assets at Buxar and Danapur by the bank, was unable to recall the date and year of the loan his son had taken.I being the guarantor and my son defaulter in the case, it was natural for the bank to seize the property, said Pehalwan.Once a wrestler, who taught wrestling in Varanasi in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Dadan plunged into politics and won as an Independent from Dumraon in 2000 Assembly poll. He was soon made commercial taxes minister in the Rabri Devi cabinet.Dadan set up the Prajatantrik Lok Ekta Dal before the 2010 Assembly polls. But he merged his outfit with HD Deve Gowdas JD (S) later. He subsequently joined forces with Mayawati after losing the poll.He contested the August 2014 Lok Sabha poll on BSP ticket but lost again.He was once the Bihar unit president of Samajwadi Party before being expelled from the party."

This would mean an end to the 170-year-old system of paying the workers in cash and kind.Under the Plantation Labour Act of 1951, a plantation workers wage is divided into cash and kind comprising ration, healthcare and education services.A plantation workers daily wage, revised in January this year, is Rs 137. He or she is also entitled to a monthly quota of 35 kg or rice and wheat at a subsidised 54 paise per kg.Assam has some 850 tea estates employing an estimated nine lakh permanent and casual workers. About 30 lakh people, including workers dependents, are beneficiaries of subsidised ration.We are not against cash transfer of wages, but the Centre has no clarity on how it will calculate the value of ration  at 54 paise or the market value of Rs 25-28 per kg. If the money transferred is at the subsidised rate of ration, it will be injustice to the workers, Congress state unit president Ripun Bora said on Sunday.A workers family members also enjoy the fruits of the present system. The government needs to examine the pros and cons before implementing a decision that appears to be pro-planters, he said.Bora also said the move was illegal since the Gauhati High Court in 2014 had stayed a similar move to kill the ration system soon after the Narendra Modi government came to power.The Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS) said it would oppose the Centres move tooth and nail.Workers must keep getting ration from the management.

The government, the minister said, has got over Rs 349 crore from the millers and the rest is still to be recovered.The minister said that during the same period, cases have been registered against 1,446 rice millers and cases to attach property had been registered against 1,676 millers, He said the government had managed to get 521 body warrants against the millers and in another 407 cases distress warrants have been issued. He said 40 body warrants and four distress warrants have been executed.The government, the minister said, had started recovery of money of over Rs 114 crore from 409 guilty state employees of which Rs 16.56 crore had been recovered and the rest was under process. Charges have been framed against 211 employees and acquisition of property cases had been registered against 485 employees.The minister stated that as per the direction of the Supreme Court the government had formed special courts in Patna, Purnia, Darbhanga, Chhapra and Gaya to hear the cases and a special investigation team (SIT) had been set up in April this year.The RJD MLAs demanded the list of guilty government officials and employees be read out in the Assembly and alleged the government was trying to save ""big officials"" involved in the scam that happened during the NDA regime. The minister offered to send the list to the RJD members.RJD MLA Alok Mehta demanded removal of officials and employees involved in the scam. Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary moved on to the next question, prompting the RJD MLAs to rush to the Well.The House was adjourned till 12 noon."

Delivering the welcome speech, Prem spoke at length about how the past two roadmaps (2008-12 & 2012-17) had boosted production as well as productivity of rice, wheat and maize.He then linked the third roadmap to the goal set by Narendra Modi to double farmers' incomes by 2022.""The roadmap would help in realising the goal set by the Prime Minister,"" Prem said.Sushil, in his address, mentioned how the regime change in Bihar started taking shape after Kovind's name came up for the presidential election.He also spoke about the achievements of the past two roadmaps and specially mentioned about the Krishi Karman awards - given by the President to the best-performing states in food grains, rice, wheat, pulses and coarse cereals - that Bihar won in 2012 (rice), 2013 (wheat) and 2016 (maize).He also mentioned how rice production had gone up from 44 lakh metric tonnes to 83 lakh metric tonnes in Bihar after implementation of the agriculture roadmaps.He then said the joint efforts of Narendra Modi and Nitish were bound to ensure Bihar's growth.The chief minister, in sharp contrast, mentioned the Centre only once in his speech - about a meeting convened by the Centre a year after Nitish had come to power in Bihar in November 2005 and in which concern had been expressed over low agricultural produce and productivity in the state.Recalling the meeting - when Manmohan Singh was PM - Nitish said: ""I had replied smiling that Bihar will get rid of this situation and please don't worry about Bihar. Since then the idea of an agriculture roadmap started taking shape.""After speaking about the achievements of the first two roadmaps, Nitish touched on the broad outlines of the third roadmap.# A BJP leader present at the event said: ""Our leaders did the right thing. Many schemes to be implemented under the agriculture roadmap would get central funds too. The credit should go both to the Centre and the state."""
5b2e5c039855b72640115abe,New GE chief shakes up management team,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/636938/ge-chief-shakes-up-management.html,2017-10-08,"General Electric last week announced the departure of three senior executives, a further sign that John L Flannery, the companys new chief executive, is moving quickly to chart a course different from that of his predecessor, Jeffrey R Immelt.The departing executives were senior members of Immelts team. Two of the three, analysts say, were not surprising given their ages and the pattern of most chief executives to make management changes after assuming control.The most striking move, they say, is the departure of Jeffrey S Bornstein, vice chairman and chief financial officer. Bornstein, 51, was regarded as a potential successor to Immelt. After Flannery was chosen as the chief executive in June, GE said he and Bornstein would work closely in the transition and Bornstein was given extra financial incentives to remain with the company.But Bornstein was GEs top finance executive under Immelt. And the criticism by activist investors who lobbied for change, helping nudge Immelt into retirement earlier than expected, was that GE should have cut costs more aggressively and spent less on new initiatives, like building up GEs software business.The strategy was Immelts, but Bornstein held the purse strings. Jeff Bornstein was Immelts guy and he lost out in the succession race to John Flannery, said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm.Flannery wants new guys, new faces and not someone tied to profit performance that fell short.In the statement announcing his departure, Bornstein said, As John evaluates the strategy for GE and puts his leadership team in place, he and I have concluded that this is the right time to bring in a new CFO with a fresh perspective. GEs new chief financial officer will be Jamie S Miller, starting in November. She has been head of the companys transportation business.The two other departing executives are John G Rice and Beth Comstock. Rice, 60, was in charge of GE international expansion efforts, known as the global growth organisation. He has been at GE for 39 years and will retire at the end of this year. Comstock, 57, oversaw the companys business innovations unit, running GEs venture investment arm as well as operations including sales, marketing and communications. Comstock, too, will retire at the end of this year.Bornstein, a 28-year GE employee, will also leave the company at the end of the year."
5b2e5c269855b72640115acd,A tasty tryst of tradition and technology,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/632495/a-tasty-tryst-tradition-technology.html,2017-09-10,"The name MTR beats in the heart of household kitchens in Karnataka. Its epicurean ensemble of ingredients, spice mixes and recipe secrets, merge into some of the most traditional, time-honoured delights, lending their taste with authenticity and nostalgia.While the 85-year-old brand is still young today, it has reinvented itself over the last decade, as it was acquired by the diversified Orkla Group of Norway.How this household name emerged as a global contemporary brand, lies in the organisational and technological steps it treads, while holding onto its traditional vibe.MTR was acquired by Orkla in February 2007, with P Sadananda Maiya (who belonged to the family that founded MTR) running the company for the first two years.One of the first investments that Orkla made with regard to MTR was in land purchases, and then into setting up a beverages business. I came aboard in February 2009, quickly sensing the brands strong local heritage, with an even stronger potential to grow, MTR Foods Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Sharma tells DH.Around this period, MTR had already built a sizeably diversified portfolio, which included spices and masalas, ready mixes, vermicelli, pickles, papads, and a brand of softies and ice creams, which connected very strongly with consumers. It was a quintessentially diversified Indian food brand, with a huge following among South Indians.When Orkla came in, people mightve felt that here comes a Norwegian company to change a Kannadiga brand. The beauty of Orkla has been to operate through a multi-local model, which means that it bought MTR to build MTR. We were clear then that we want to build MTR into a stable, local company, ensuring that its entire talent was local, Sharma says, stressing on the decentralisation and diversified methods of management within the company.The acquisition helped MTR to hone its operations further with global best practices and approaches. At a very early stage, one of the aspects that the new management looked into was its people. We recognised that we had a great team of talented, passionate people. We didnt want to make too many changes in the company, but ensure optimal running with the same resources, Sharma says.Technology to tasteAs a Bengaluru-based company, MTR is blessed with a favourable IT landscape. Computerisation at the company was at a reasonable level from the beginning. MTR began to emphasise on automation, apart from bringing in new technology. This was also linked to the second area that we wont compromise on the safety of our products, Sharma says.High quality-consciousness has been a hallmark of MTR. Even MTR restaurants offered visibility into the kitchen, reassuring patrons of the quality maintained and sustained as an ingrained value, which even Orkla shares. Also, investment in automation reduced physical handling of products.Over a period of time, several changes were introduced in the company, with the first one being to contemporarise the brand and segment it in a meaningful manner. While we had spices and masalas, there was another large category called instant mixes, which actually none could relate to. So we converted that into breakfast mixes and dessert mixes for people to understand. We also began to form the direction in which we wanted to grow, wherein we decided to operate in the traditional Indian food space, becoming a friend in the kitchen, the CEO says.Therefore, with a clear perspective, MTR defined itself as a culinary brand wanting to help consumers make breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and dessert. This simplified the understanding of the companys portfolio significantly, and it was able to build its business systematically. Even in terms of spending on advertising, what used to be 3% of turnover earlier, grew to 16% and beyond, as of today.MTR has always been known for its innovation. It must be interesting to relate an anecdote: It is widely believed that the popular rava idli was invented by MTR during World War II as a substitute for the traditional rice idli, since rice was in short supply at that time. Lately, it has innovated relevant products such as the multi-grain dosa, ragi idli, oats idli, and so on. In the first two to three years, we didnt do much, but really started innovating from 2012 onwards. Between 2012 and 2016, we had close to 50 innovations, which have been introduced in the market, informs Sharma.New food, new flavoursThe market today has a new set of consumers -- from the traditional homemaker to discerning millennials and professionals. Hence, there is a dichotomy in consumer products too. They seek the modern, but prefer the traditional.Brands like us bridge the gap between modern and traditional. While our products remain traditional, our delivery mechanism is modern. Our tone and manner of talking to consumers and packaging are modern. We are putting traditional in the centre, which is food, and enveloping it with very modern values. We still talk to homemakers via traditional advertising, while we are able to package quirky messaging through digital activation. All this is helping us bridge the gap, he says.Today, owing to new customer segments, MTR has an expansive product portfolio, with 450 SKUs, across 140 product ranges. Category-wise, 37% of MTRs business comes from pure spices and blended spices (masalas), 32% from ready mixes (breakfast mixes 10%, sweet mixes 10%, dinner mixes 7%), 14% from vermicelli, and 7% from ready-to-eat, while SnackUp, pickles, and beverages, among others, contribute the remaining. Over 70% of the business comes from products made in Bengaluru, while some portion is contract-manufactured. As a comprehensive kitchen ingredients brand, MTR has come a long way. We are investing in research. We have created a Centre of Excellence for Indian Food, where we have around eight chefs who are dedicated for this research. At the end of the day, the recipe is the most important element for us, Sharma reflects.One Orkla for MTRMTR has benefitted from the One Orkla concept abundantly. Roughly, One Orkla refers to the strengths of Orkla being shared between all its entities, including by the Norwegian group itself, ensuring that they grow together.It was opportune to integrate One Orkla into MTRs strategy and leverage the other firms strengths and learnings. For instance, we launched our vegetable idli mix (with 40% vegetables), which was inspired by a similar product launched in Denmark, he says.Recently, MTR enabled the launch of Orklas confectionery brand Laban in India, however, suiting it to Indian preferences.Will MTR be the face for Orkla in India? Sharma says that one must differentiate MTR as a brand, and as a company. As a company, we like to host multiple brands in our portfolio. We are test-marketing with Jordan toothbrushes, and would diversify into more brands, he adds. Going beyond snacks and food, whether with Orklas brands or its own, MTR will always look to localise, in tandem with its traditional roots."

But now, the 44-year-old entrepreneur is providing breakfast to millions of people, literally.It was not an easy journey for this school dropout from Chennalode, a village in Wayanad district of Kerala, who went on to study MBA at IIM-B, and turned out to be an entrepreneur, whose companys turnover was Rs 144 crore in the last fiscal. He wants to make it a Rs 1,000-crore business in another four years.Musthafa, who founded iD Fresh Food, has set a mission of making the preparation of home-made meals a pleasure.It all started at the fag-end of 2006, when Musthafa was pursuing his MBA. His cousins were running a kirana store in Thippasandra, Bengaluru. They found that the idly and dosa batter supplied by the vendor was unhygienic and not packed properly. When his cousins  Shamsudeen T K, Abdul Nazer, Jafar T K and Noushad T A  were discussing about it with Musthafa, the idea of supplying fresh and neatly packed batter struck them.What followed after this idea was not a smooth journey, the path with full of ups and downs  just like any other successful entrepreneurs go through. But what made all the five, especially Musthafa to easily go through the phase was his initial struggle as a child in Wayanad. His father was a wage labourer, and sometimes, during his holidays, Musthafa used to accompany his father on labourers work just to support the family.He failed in Class 6, but a sheer zeal to do something made him join school again, become a topper in Class 7, and then in Class 10. He went on to do engineering, and worked in a few companies before joining IIM-B.Coming back to his entrepreneurial journey, Musthafa recalls those tough days. We had no experience in packaged foods, and we were clueless about fermentation. We rented a small place 60-70 sq feet near the kirana store and invested together Rs 50,000, to purchase a grinder and mixer. Initially, it was difficult, as we couldnt sell many packets, also we were mixing 5,000 kg of rice and providing free samples to our kirana store customers, says Musthafa.He adds that they got the right product mix and from then on there was no looking back. It took us nine months to sell 100 packets of idly dosa batter, and after that we were confident of selling more, says the CEO & Co-founder of iD Fresh Food.From idly and dosa (iD), now it has become a brand, having presence across the country. The companys vision is to become a fresh food brand, admired and trusted the world over. We produce and deliver fresh food to our customers every single day. We take great pride in our home-made style of preparation in ultra-hygienic, HACCP compliant factories, he says.We launched recently in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada, and we are planning to launch in Delhi and Ahmedabad by the end of this fiscal, he says.Dubai journeyThe iD team found that idly and dosa batter demand is not just across the country, but also outside India.Knowing this demand, iD was launched in Dubai, catering to huge Indian population there. We have one factory in Dubai, and the Dubai market alone contributes to 25% of our total revenues. Its a very good market and we are seeing huge opportunities there, he said, adding that they are also looking at other countries. We are exploring multiple opportunities, he says.Idly, dosa batter and moreFrom just idly and dosa batter, iD diversified its product offerings by introducing Malabar parota and chapati. Later, it also added paneer and curd.Now, iD is planning to explore the superfood range by introducing ragi, vada and millet batter, and wheat dosa. We will be launching ragi batter on August 15, and other batters by September. We want to explore and also cater to the health-conscious segment, by providing healthy food choices, he says.Quiz him about the ready-to-cook segment size, the answer one gets is mind-boggling. Yes, there is a Rs 1,000-crore business opportunity just in idly batter in Bengaluru alone.Close to 94% of idly batter is prepared at home. Compare this scenario with a decade ago when wheat was grounded carefully by grinding at home. But now people are looking for wholesome flour to make fluffy rotis, he says. Similarly, the idly and dosa batter will also become readily available and widely used, opines Musthafa.While the company closed the last fiscal with Rs 144 crore, it expects the turnover to be Rs 230-240 crore this fiscal, and to reach Rs 1,000 crore in four years.From selling just 100 packets a month, we have come a long way by selling two million packets a month across 20,000 stores, and our distribution network is in 12 cities. We sell idly batter that can make 35 crore idlies a year. Idly and dosa batter alone contributes to 50% of revenues, followed by parota (25-30%), chapati (9-10%), and paneer and curd (10%), says the CEO.The company has five factories in India  two in Bengaluru, one each in Chennai, Mumbai and Hyderabad, and one in Dubai.I never ever thought in my life I would be feeding people on a daily basis, Musthafa says, claiming that iD batter is authentic, 100% natural and against pesticides.In March this year, it raised Rs 150 crore from PremjiInvest, the private equity firm of Azim Premji, and in October 2014, the company raised Rs 35 crore from Helion Venture Partners.People behind iDiD employs 1,500 people at present, and its operations are automated and also technologically-driven.While Musthafas cousin Shamsudeen oversees production operations across geographies, his other cousins  Abdul Nazer oversees product development, Jafar has designed and created iDs unique distribution model, and Noushad manages human resources.I want to provide employment opportunities to people from rural areas. Its not tough to become an entrepreneur as all you need is a good team, and I have got one. Also, you need to find the right product, and we have one, he concludes."

The BJP's Bengal minder, Kailash Vijayvargiya, and state president Dilip Ghosh were by his side.Supriyo referred to the cheap food grain scheme run by the Centre across the country under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The Union minister claimed that rice given to the poor at Rs 2 a kg in Bengal was actually a central scheme for which the Centre supplies rice to the state at Rs 3 a kg. While the state gives a subsidy of Re 1 on every kilo, the Centre shoulders Rs 29.67, he added.""The state has a total of 8 crore beneficiaries under khadyasathi. The Centre supplies rice at Rs 3 a kg for 6.1 crore beneficiaries. The state has 1.9 crore beneficiaries over and above the NFSA list and they are given cheap food grain, the cost of which is shouldered by the state,"" said an official.The minister also accused a section of Trinamul leaders of demanding Rs 900 from beneficiaries for a toilet under the Swachh Bharat Mission.""The Centre gives Rs 8,000 per toilet and the states add according to their capacities. In Bengal, it is Rs 12,000 per toilet, with the state's contribution of Rs 4,000. But why is Rs 900 being sought then?"" the minister questioned.Senior Trinamul leaders declined comment on the minister's remarks."

On one hand, the money allocated per student per day for mid-day meal is lower than the current retail price of an egg.On the other hand, there is a clear government directive that the students must be provided with eggs at least once a week.""As of now, an egg is selling at Rs 7, whereas, we get Rs 4.13 for each student per day. It is obvious that we can't afford to buy eggs even once a week, given the current price,"" said the headmaster of a primary school in Alipurduar town.In the district, there are 841 primary schools and another 100-odd Sishu Siksha Kendras. In total, around 68,000 students study in these institutions.""Even a week ago, the price of an egg was between Rs 4 to Rs. 4.50. We could easily provide it to the children once a week. But because of this sudden rise, it has become a concern for us. Also, the prices of vegetables have soared and altogether, it is a complicated situation,"" said a teacher.""There are instances that teachers had to face departmental actions like show cause for not following the stipulated menu. Also, guardians might express anguish once they learn that their children are not provided eggs. We really don't know how to handle the situation,"" the teacher said.For mid-day meal, the rice is supplied by the government to school. The amount of Rs 4.13 is provided for other food items and costs of cooking.The teachers pointed out that providing egg in a menu would cost them at least Rs 11 for a meal.""This means, we have to save money on the other days. It is not possible to save Rs 6-7 (the margin) in the remaining five days, as the allotment is meagre. It would be better if the government supplies us the eggs or makes an arrangement where we can get it at lower rates,"" a teacher said.Leaders of primary teachers' associations admitted the problem.""We will take up the issue with officials of the primary education council,"" said Kaushik Sarkar, the president of a teachers' union."

Not only will it lower the breakfast costs for the facility by at least 60 per cent, but also provide an additional work opportunity to the inmates, the officials said.Puffed rice, or muri, is a popular breakfast snack, especially popular in the Birbhum-Burdwan belt. However, it is widely consumed elsewhere in Bengal, other parts of the country and Bangladesh.Traditionally, the snack is produced by heating rice kernels in a sand-filled oven. The processing makes the rice less perishable.Sources said the additional production - of up to 250 kilos a day - would be sold to other correctional homes of the district and in neighbouring East Burdwan.""Here, puffed rice is a staple, especially for breakfast. Instead of buying puffed rice worth Rs 30,000 a month, we can not only manufacture our own for Rs 12,000 or less, but also sell the additional produce to other correctional facilities,"" said Abdullah Kamal, superintendent of the Suri District Correctional Home.The machine already bought, the authorities are now awaiting the completion of the assembling process. Sources said a team of technicians from Calcutta was expected to come next week and complete the process.""The inmates would be trained on the preparation and packaging. They have to contribute by way of work in accordance to norms in such homes. Some of them can get involved in the production. They will be paid in accordance to existing rates,"" said a senior official.He said the authorities also planned to set up a stall to sell the puffed rice to visitors.""Every day, at least 50 visitors come to meet the inmates.

5b2e83639855b72640116073,Retaining farmers on the farm,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/637983/retaining-farmers-farm.html,2017-11-02,"World Food Day (WFD) is celebrated to commemorate the founding of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in 1945. The objective is to create awareness leading to food security and to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. This year, the theme is, change the future of migration, invest in food security and rural development.The FAO estimates that about 763 million people move within their own countries due to hunger, poverty and the increase in extreme weather-related events linked to climate change. Almost a third of Indias population, over 300 million people, migrate within the country.The FAO calls for creating conditions that allow rural youth to stay on the farm by providing resilient livelihoods to tackle the migration challenge. Creating business opportunities that are non-crop based, in food processing and horticultural enterprises, leading to increased food security. There is an urgent need to build sustainable growth based on long-term recovery of the rural community. This call is totally at odds with the present policies and trends affecting the agricultural sector in India.According to the National Sample Survey Organisation, 45% of the farmers interviewed want to quit farming. Declining agricultural productivity and profitability are disincentives for the younger generation, forcing them to migrate.The stagnating farm sector, with a large number of suicides in different parts of the country, provides a scary picture of the future of farming. In such a grim scenario, is it possible to attract youth to agricultural sector? Will farm-based employment provide a decent livelihood opportunity to educated youth, with a life of assured income and dignity?In order to check inflation, the farm gate prices are deliberately kept low. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) fixed by the central government does not assist the farmer to recover his costs. The MSP covers limited crops, and its coverage is restricted to irrigated regions in north India.Unfortunately, the overall development discourse and education in our country is geared towards building the urban sector. Investment in agriculture and rural development is on the decline. The policies do not favour those who produce food. Economists think that it is cheaper to import food. This attitude of neglecting the farmers has disastrous consequences for the farm economy.The Narendra Modi government has launched several initiatives to address the farm crisis. The flagship programmes, like Soil Health Card, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, etc., are some of the schemes providing support to farmers.The most unique initiative is Attracting and Retaining Youth in Agriculture (ARYA). Launched by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, it aims to attract and retain youth in rural areas through providing sustainable income through value-addition, and establish market linkages to make it attractive for the younger generation to return to the villages.The government has set the ambitious target of doubling the farmers income by 2022, when the country completes 75 years of independence. Unfortunately, most of these initiatives have had very limited impact on farmers, like the failure of weather-based crop insurance in which farmers received compensation of less than Rs 10 for loss of their crop! These schemes have failed to address the negative impact of climate change in agriculture.Despite these schemes to attract youth, the majority of them, even those belonging to farming families, do not want to pursue the vocation of their ancestors. They have experienced the harshness of the life of a farmer, where all his efforts to earn a decent income after putting in hard labour produces meagre income or total loss during drought, pushing him deep into debt.Converting this crisis into opportunity, reverse migration from cities to countryside has begun. A small number of dedicated youngsters are taking to agriculture. When large numbers of established farmers are keen to quit, the young people are swimming against the tide, taking enormous risks.Nadish, a young paddy farmer from Shikaripura, says,  I have evolved farming methods with low external inputs and my yields are 50% higher. He markets his organic rice directly to consumers, which fetches him a premium price.What we need urgently is to implement policies supporting youth who are keen to practice agriculture by providing an assured income. Technological innovations can help them establish a direct linkage with the consumer, providing a sustained income. The government should identify successful young farmers and provide media and policy support, with the grand mission of feeding millions with safe and nutritious food.With 25% of the countrys population between 18-29 years, it has great potential to entice youth towards the farm sector. Farming offers the young generation a chance to make a difference by growing food to achieve the Zero Hunger target.Under these circumstances, we need multiple strategies that enhance the status of the young farmers to retain them on the farm. If jai jawan jai kisan was the slogan of an earlier era, today we need a slogan to recognise the farmer as the soldier of Mother Earth, protecting our soil and producing food for all of us."
5b2e83a89855b7264011607d,Lessons from Gandhi land,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/634430/lessons-gandhi-land.html,2017-09-24,"My early professional years in a bank were at a small town in Gujarat. I was fresh out of college from Bangalore, but the friendly Gujaratis put me at ease almost immediately. My conversational link was Hindi. While the Gujaratis were quite comfortable when they spoke in their own language, their Hindi, however, was broken and mixed generously with Gujarati. As a young, fledgling 20-something, I cut my teeth on finance, banking, thrift, and business from these enterprising and genial people.My learning curve started here. For over five years, I had an intriguing and exciting time. Barely after a year in the bank, I had this strange and surprising offer from a customer, a wholesale rice trader. Come, join my firm as a manager, he said. He was ready to compensate me more than what I was earning at the time. Over the years, I learnt that Gujaratis have an uncanny knack of spotting the right people to man key areas. This is one of the reasons they are more successful in business or as entrepreneurs.During my regular walks with my colleague Parekhbhai, I found him frequently enquiring at the local grocery store. I was curious  what was he enquiring about every day? When I asked him one day, pat came the reply: he was monitoring the price of groundnut oil! When it reached the expected lowest value, he said, he would order a quantity adequate for consumption for several months. Yes, this was a great lesson for me in how one must use thrift, and stretch the value of money and increase savings.The Gujaratis had a hierarchy for saving money and for investment. It went something like this: first, one has to have enough liquidity and, hence, one must always keep some money in a savings account. The rest of the investments would be in fixed deposits, gold, shares, mutual funds and, finally, land and buildings, in that order. It is no surprise then that even in the 1980s, when equities were relatively uncommon, every other Gujarati had some investment in the stock market.That they were calculative and shrewd was proved by their actions. Interest on working capital overdraft accounts were charged on daily products. The bank absolutely could not afford to make mistakes as the customers invariably maintained daily products in parallel! Our customer Desai bhai of Desai Brothers, a retail firm, would rush in at the very last minute before close of cash hours on a Saturday to deposit the maximum possible cash into the overdraft account so that the product for two days  Saturday and Sunday  was minimised!Indeed, my stint in Gujarat was the clichd paradigm shift in my maturity, wisdom and thought process. I came out stronger and ready to face the world, thanks to the land and the people of arguably the greatest Indian  Mahatma Gandhi."
5b2e848d9855b72640116098,Culture shocks and cucumbers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/651710/culture-shocks-cucumbers.html,2017-12-12,"Last month, the research group I joined recently, got together for the annual Christmas meal or 'Julefrokost' as they call it in Danish. As per tradition, the newest member of the group (me) was in-charge of the cooking. Of course, I decided to cook traditional South Indian food. I had already stirred their curiosity with the food I took for lunch.A month after eating raw vegetables and boiled potatoes everyday (yes, I am a vegetarian, and no, I don't consider fish as vegetarian unlike my Danish colleagues nor fried bacon a spice), I decided to wake up 30 minutes earlier than usual to prepare a tastebud tickling South Indian lunch. This led to another exercise. I had to explain to my colleagues what it is that I was eating every single day. ""Sambhar is a lentil-based vegetable curry cooked with a tamarind broth and a 'secret' spice mix,'' I told them after thinking all morning about it.I took rice and sorekai thovve or lauki dal one day. ""Bottle gourd and split lentils cooked with whole and powdered spices with a tempering of cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves,'' I told them confidently. They looked at me baffled. Bottle gourd! Asafoetida! Curry leaves! It took me the rest of the lunch break to explain to them what these were. Thereafter, I was careful what I made for lunch. It is one thing making rava idli (from the ready-mix that I made sure I packed while leaving home) and another thing explaining it to someone who has never seen or tasted anything like it before.On the day of the Julefrokost, I expected them to be surprised by the okra, snake gourd, spluttering mustard seeds or at least when I mentioned that they had to eat with their right hand only. But the culture shockwaves swept through the room when I asked the person in-charge of the cucumbers why he wasn't milking it first. He was aghast ""Milk the cucumber?!"" There was silence in the room as everyone wondered if they had heard it right. In a matter-of-fact way, I repeated the question and then realised that this concept wasn't as universal as I thought. I then demonstrated it only to have a few people laughing uncontrollably, few others taking videos and the rest thinking that I was playing a prank.An Italian colleague entered just as I was defending the process of milking the cucumber to get rid of the bitterness and was trying to use some kind of logical reasoning for it. He casually added that in Italy, even zucchinis are 'milked' and I heaved a sigh of relief that it wasn't just me. He, too, was asked to demonstrate it and obviously he did it the same way you or I would. Then, two bowls were passed around - one with slices of a 'milked' cucumber and the other with an 'unmilked' one - and everyone was asked to identify which one was milked. But how can you tell the difference if the cucumbers are not bitter? I learned one thing that day - there are no bitter cucumbers in Denmark."

What left me gobsmacked was his untiring rolling on the scorching hot tar road, clad only in a dhoti with his torso uncovered, while adroitly holding the copper pail containing rice grains and a few coins well above the noggin, not letting even a wee bit of it drop. Such phenomenal dexterity was all but impossible without much practice.This form of worship among Hindus is known as angapradhakshanam, where after an ablution of oneself, a man or a woman rolls on the ground around the sanctum sanctorum of the temple with arms stretched out and joined together in fulfilment of any vow promised by them.Other than the occasional movement of cycles and hand-pulled rickshaws, there were almost no motorised vehicles plying on the roads in residential areas those days, thus leaving the man uninterrupted to his rolling. I would gaze at him wide-eyed from our house, my ears enjoying his continuous utterance of the same two monosyllables till he rolled over to the next house. At this point, I would advance to the gate and continue to feast my eyes on that the strange sight. While my mother never tut-tutted at this activity since it also involved giving alms to cadgers, I would indulge in staring only on Sundays and during school vacations.Another cry, shrill and fairly loud, with a prolonged accent of a single syllable, O and distinct ring to it, would emanate from the crossroads mostly in the afternoon hours. That belonged to a Chinese man with a pack of colourful pieces of cloth tied to his bicycle carrier which he sell to his usual customers in our residential locality.Now, over three scores later, as numerous condominiums are supplanting the independent, compound-walled houses of the residential areas, my contemporaries and I can only think of where these people have vanished to with the flavour and fineness of that era."

But how far should healthy eating stretch?A close relative of mine had some rigid ideas about eating certain types of food and believed that he had made the best choice, which became a habit over a period of time. After he got married, his wife cooked according to his taste and requirement and all went well until one day he complained of mouth ulcers.That day, lunch came with a special kind of greens to treat mouth ulcers, along with a detailed account of the hea lth benefits of the herb. Notwithstanding the unpleasant taste, he had to devour it to achieve the expected results! That was the beginning of his health capsule.Health problems of various degrees are common in every household, and he or the children would occasionally complain of stomach upset, sore throat, cold, etc. The lady of the house, keen on restoring the family's health, started her research on home remedies. She came up with a list of vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices that were ""good for health"" and helped relieve many problems. She made the healthy eating strategy a routine, whether or not there was any issue!Bittergourd was cooked to check blood sugar. Banana stem, considered good for kidney stones, was used, while fried plantain and potato curry that were starchy and lead to gastric problems were avoided. As detoxifying agents, salads became a must. Since oily and fatty food raised bad cholesterol, steamed and boiled food was regularised. To maintain a stable BP and heart condition, a low-salt diet and use of garlic was introduced. Buttermilk/curd (Lacto bacilli) was compulsory after every meal to avoid stomach infections.To augment weight loss, vegetables with more water content like, cucumber, ash gourd and chow-chow made silent entry into the kitchen. Many other unfamiliar ""healthy vegetables"" became more familiar! Now, health mattered most than the taste! If someone had anattack of cold, the entire family was served pepper-jeera rasam!Oats pongal, millets idli and ragi dosa, occasional rice idli/dosa and cereals with low-fat milk were in the breakfast menu. A generous use of herbs and spices in every dish was incorporated for their special properties like healing, alleviating gastric problem, nausea, allergies and to serve as antacid.Evening snacks comprised a bowl of mixed fruits and nuts. Green tea was a forced favourite drink of the family. The entire range of ""healthy foods"" was stocked for the whole year. This revolution happened amid the initial, timid resentment from the rest of the family!During one of our visits to their house, we were baffled seeing him eat something which he had condemned as ""cattle feed"" long ago. Then he exclaimed, ""Every meal in this house is a medicine. I eat this for digestion and weight control. In this house we seldom eat 'tasty'... sorry 'unhealthy' food""!"
5b2e85469855b726401160ae,Snap deals,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/632508/snap-deals.html,2017-09-24,"The consumerist society we live in has made us susceptible to deals such as freebies, discounts, offers. Abig banner outside a super bazaar caught my eye. Fabulous offer! 25% discount on rice, wheat and sugar! it read. I was intrigued. In this day and age, when expenses are swirling like smoke from a heap of garbage on fire, the screaming banner appeared to be manna from heaven.I strode into the shop purposefully and asked for details. The offer was on 25 kg wheat and rice bags and 10 kg sugar bag. As I wasnt planning to open an eatery or to cater to a wedding party, I retreated, quite disappointed. A 5% discount on a kilogram would have helped, I thought ruefully.Flippancy aside, space is a constraint and storage poses a problem. And with the passing of time and the growth of technology, we have become soft. Even lifting not-so-heavy weights leads to aches and pains. This, in turn, entails medical expense, loss of time and a drop in productivity. Most of us prefer small packs even if at an extra cost.Recently, I received a sipper with a ready-mix pack. I refused the free gift because the baby of the family is a sturdy 21-year-old! With a packet of jelly, I was offered a mould free. I wasnt impressed and took just the jelly. That the mould was horrendous in colour didnt endear it to buyers!Another time, when I picked up a bottle of Nescafe, the shop assistant favoured me with a shaker that accompanied it. I pretended to forget it and left it behind.The alert shop assistant came after me with it. I told him I didnt want it. He extolled its usefulness, right there in the middle of the busy road. Dodging traffic and dealing with the persistent shop assistant was, to say the least, rather a difficult task. Wanting to avoid drawing the attention of passersby, I took the wretched thing and stuffed it into my shopping bag.A similar experience awaited me when I picked up a box of cereal. Here is a bowl for you! said the fresh-faced, bright-eyed youngster who attended to me. It was done with the air of a conjuror! Meekly, I accepted the plastic eye-sore, even thanking him, as I didnt want to be subjected to another sales-pitch barrage!Needless to say, I discarded it, followed by the sipper, the shaker and the mould, though I am not sure if it was strictly in that order."

They think the word was coined to aptly describe their children's activities. Whenever parents meet up, they share the woes of bringing up children, over a cup of tea. Children, though, have a different take on this. 'Who is reprimanded for eating too fast and not chewing slowly; for bad handwriting and shoddy homework; for not cleaning behind the ears and not applying soap all over; for eating rice and dal with hand; for not using fork and knife while eating out?'Well, one cannot comprehend the careworn lives of children. I recall that time when, while going up the lift with my friend's father, also our neighbour, I was advised by him to talk to my friend, his daughter, in English only. A few days later, my father while using the lift with my friend told her to talk only in English with me. When we friends exchanged notes, we shared a good laugh.Parental concern surfaced again when my aunt sent her son, my cousin, to stay with us during the summer vacation. He carried a letter from my uncle addressed to my father where I was requested to tutor him. Call it flattery or what. My uncle preceded my name with 'dear' umpteen times though once would have had the same effect.Every time we visited our father at Pathankot, where he was posted, he would order the cook to make only kheer for dinner. To appreciate sweetness, one should always have a dash of something salty. But, my father insisted on us having bowls and bowls of kheer till our stomach could not take it anymore. We began dreading dinners.My brother seems to have inherited the genes of my father. His daughter is just four-year-old and is already attending ballet, football and swimming classes. He is leaving no stone unturned to expose her to all avenues. My sister-in-law says that she would like to start kathak and classical music classes soon for her. My sister made my nephew attend tennis, golf, violin and casio classes. My nephew had to carry a lot of baggage other than his school bag.Being the only children, they are the focus of all the attention. My uncle bought a cow for his farmhouse as their first child was a fussy eater and cow's milk was believed to be easily digestible and good for children, too.Gone are the days, when families used to be large and children had to fend for themselves and their siblings. Now, as families grow nuclear, parents turn overanxious. They fuss and obsess over whether their children are eating well-balanced and wholesome meals, doing well in studies and on the playground as well as performing admirably in extracurricular activities. God help them!"

Four years later, my family began pressurising me that it was high time I quit the job. I gave lame excuses and continued. One morning, when my wife stated that she was about to become a senior citizen and wanted retirement from household chores, I decided to call it a day and help her.On a Monday, when I did not leave for office at nine, everyone was surprised and wanted to know the reason. I dramatically announced my retirement and said that I would henceforth enjoy a calm and comfortable life doing things close to my heart. I also told my wife that she could take a back seat and that I would take over her responsibilities, and for starters, I would cook.Though everyone was amused, none protested. On the first two days, I cooked the only dishes that I knew how to cook-Dal and Chawal for lunch and upma for breakfast. The next day I managed with ready to cook dishes. Unable to digest (!) my culinary offerings, my family voted for status quo which permanently ended my forays into the kitchen.The next week, I volunteered to go to the market and buy household necessities. A single glance at the bill and the items I had purchased resulted in an unending harangue by my wife. ""The rice is full of insects, apart from costing more. How could you purchase goods worth millions for your company without incurring loss?"" she questioned. My entry into purchase department was thus blocked forever.My daughter in law then thought that the best way to utilize my time was to help her in managing her kids. She suggested that I go to my grandson's school and bring him back home. The school was close by and I volunteered that I would start from that very afternoon. Before the closing time, I was in front of the school gate. A group of mothers stood outside. Waiting for the gates to open, I eavesdropped on the hot topic of their discussion -the sudden death of actress Sridevi. The conspiracy theories being floated made me regret as to why I had not thought of consulting them when I had worked as chief of CID.Soon the school gates opened. When the name of my grandson was called, I inched ahead. The class teacher gave one look at me and said that she cannot hand over the kid as she didn't recognize me. ""Look, I am the boy's grandpa, if you don't believe me, you can check with him,"" I told her. ""Nowadays kidnappers are coming in the shape of grandpas,"" said the security guard. The gathered mothers gave a guffaw. I told the teacher, ""Madam, I swear I am his grandfather. I am a former cop. You have to trust me."" She shook her head vigorously and sternly said, ""Sir, only the mother is authorized to pick up the child, I am sorry."" Meanwhile, the child started howling. I called my daughter in law who rushed in her scooter and took the child back.When I returned home, my wife said, ""You are unfit for any domestic work. Please circulate your CVs and start your third innings."""
5b2e92789855b7264011632a,Punjab's farm crisis a tragic irony,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/649073/punjabs-farm-crisis-tragic-irony.html,2017-12-12,"Punjab, the food bowl of the country, is faced with a paradox of plenty. Ever since the launch of the Green Revolution in 1966, Punjab has been producing a record grain surplus year after year. Yet, over the years, it has turned into a graveyard for its farmers. There is hardly a day when reports of farmers committing suicide do not appear in Punjab newspapers.Take a look at the food procurement figures for 2017-18. Of the total wheat procurement of 308.24 lakh tonnes, Punjab had contributed 117.06 lakh tonnes, thereby providing more than 37% of the country's wheat requirement. As for rice, for which the procurement season is still in progress, Punjab had contributed 174.35 lakh tonnes till November 28. This is 67% of the total rice procurement of 258.18 lakh tonnes.In other words, Punjab continues to be the top contributor to the national food kitty. Whichever year, and regardless of the extent of climatic aberrations, Punjab has dutifully delivered food for the country.Now hold your breath. A bumper grain production year after year belies the grave tragedy that has been worsening with each passing year. According to a survey by Punjab Agricultural University, as many as 16,000 farmers and farm labourers have committed suicide in the past 17 years, between 2000 and 2017 - an average of about 900 suicides per year. Of these, 83% committed suicide distressed by a mountain of unpaid debt; and 76.1% of them owned less than two acres of land.Every third farmer in Punjab is below the poverty line. Still worse, nearly 66% of these farmers and farm labourers who took their own lives were young. Surely, like all young people, they too had dreams. What made them to abruptly end their lives?As if this is not enough, the Punjab government has gone back on its electoral promise to waive off Rs 2 lakh from each small farmer's outstanding debt. It has now clarified that if the outstanding loan of a small farmer, owning less than five acres, is even Rs 100 more than Rs 2 lakh, he will not be eligible for the loan waiver.The tragedies that have struck many families in rural Punjab symbolise the agony that the entire farming community is living in. Those who have refrained from taking the extreme step are no better. They continue to somehow survive, living under acute stress, mental agony, depression and hoping against hope. Still, the bigger question that remains unanswered is, how can the nation's food bowl turn into a farmers' graveyard? How can Punjab be in the deadly grip of an unending agrarian crisis?That such a tragic serial dance of death is being enacted in a state that is considered to be the most prosperous as far as agriculture is concerned tells us clearly that the crisis is the outcome of an inherently flawed farming model.I have heard agricultural economists and policymakers often blame low crop productivity, failure to diversify crops, and lack of irrigation. But, in a state which has 98% assured irrigation and where the per hectare yields of wheat and paddy match international levels, those cannot be the reasons for farmers' suicides. Instead, it's the opposite - high crop productivity-linked intensive farming model - that's to blame.Deeper crisisAs per Economic Survey 2016, the per hectare yield of wheat in Punjab stands at 4,500 kg/hectare which matches the wheat yields in the United States. In the case of paddy, the average yield is 6,000 kg/hectare, quite close to productivity levels in China. With such high yields and with abundant irrigation available, why should farmers be dying?To say that these farmers are lazy, drunkards or do not spend the loans for the purpose they take cannot be true. If it were so, I see no way Punjab could have topped global crop productivity; or how Punjab could feed the entire country with its grain surplus every year, and that too continuously for the past 50 years.Punjab is in a terrible crisis because of the economic and development policies that encourage intensive agriculture. To meet its food requirements, erstwhile Punjab (including Haryana, which later split) became the focal point of a highly intensive agriculture, beginning with wheat, rice and then followed by a shift towards cultivation of cotton as a cash crop.While intensive farming played havoc with soil fertility, necessitating application of more chemical fertilisers, excessive use and abuse of chemical pesticides has contaminated the food chain as well as the environment.The tragedy is that we haven't learnt any lessons. As if this is not enough, the effort now is to push Punjab deeper into the environmentally harmful web of agri-business, which requires more intensive farming, adding to more greenhouse gas emissions. It's like moving from the frying pan literally into fire.What Punjab desperately needs is to move away from the intensive cropping system. It requires a shift in the research mandate of the PAU, accompanied by policies and programmes that encourage farmers to shift without suffering any economic loss."

Sutra wants to revive the use of indigo, which suffered in the nineteenth century with the indigo revolt in this part of the world and the invention of the synthetic indigo colour in Germany.The second hall had on display a large collection of paintings using indigo and other natural dyes.Monoleena Banerjee, a textile professional in charge of the indigo dyeing workshops, reminded that indigo was as old as Mohenjodaro. The priests garment was touched with it. Navy blue, the colour of the uniform, was also named after indigo. She thinks Blues music has something to do with the condition of African workers in indigo plantations.Indigo researcher Jenny Balfour-Paul was also part of the project.The exhibition is showing till Saturday."

Picture by Sanjoy ChattopadhyayaBaruipur: Sumantra Nath Bhaduri is back home after living a nightmare whose memory often overlaps the happiness of being reunited with his family after more than seven months.""Imagine seeing nothing but water all around and eating rice, dal and chicken broth every day for months. Think what it would be like to look for hope amid frustration, anger and despair,"" the merchant navy engineer said.Sumantra, 40, was part of a 25-member crew left to fend for themselves without water supply and proper rations on board a vessel stranded on the Gulf of Oman since mid-June. MT Maharshi Vamadeva, the 34,974-tonne vessel carrying LPG, had been intercepted because the shipping company that owns it allegedly owed money to the Port of Fujairah .Metro, whichhad highlighted Sumantra's plight on October 4, revisited his Baruipur home during the weekend to know how he survived the ordeal.Eye on distant lightsSumantra's job has made him immune to sea sickness, but nothing had prepared him for the torment of being trapped in a vessel anchored 10 nautical miles (18.5km) away from the port. For almost five months, he did not see land.""Morning, afternoon or evening, every time I stood on the deck, the only constant was water. We were not even allowed to row a small boat to reach the port,"" he recalled.The lights of Fujairah quickly became Sumantra's connection with land. By day, visibility was often poor. ""I would dread going to the deck because of the same sight. But you need fresh air. Speaking to people on vessels passing by was also a distraction,"" he said.Hope floats on dieselSumantra and his crew knew that their survival depended on keeping the generator and the engines running. For that, the vessel needed two tonnes of diesel every day. The shipping company's local handling agency would supply 50 tonnes of diesel at a time for 25 days.""Had the engine shut down once, it would have been a big hassle to get it up and running again,"" the engineer said.Keeping the air-conditioners working was a challenge too. ""The weather was hot and we could not afford to lose whatever supplies we had on board. I would get tense about any delay in refuelling,"" Sumantra said.Clockwork boredom6am: Morning walk on the deck7am: Inspection of ship and meeting10am: Communication with authoritiesNoon: Lunch1pm: Communication with authorities5pm: Exercise on the deck""Life became so predictable and monotonous that everyone knew where I would be at a particular time of day. If it was 5pm, they knew that I would be on the deck,"" Sumantra said.Even the weather did not change in those five months. ""In Calcutta, we experience a hot and humid summer, then rain and lastly winter. There, it was hot and humid every day. Blazing sun during the day with some fog. Not a drop of rain throughout,"" he said.Sumantra had a collection of Bengali films featuring Uttam Kumar and Soumitra Chatterjee that he watched over and over. By the time he was released along with six other sailors on November 6, he had seen each film half a dozen times.Chicken to the rescueBy the end of August, the sailors had exhausted their stock of vegetables. From then on, every meal had chicken broth with rice and some dal. ""I began to hate chicken. I was dying to eat fish,"" Sumantra said.Trial by despairFor months, there was no hope of getting permission to leave the vessel. There would be regular communication with the authorities but no breakthrough. ""Each day would start with hope of some positive development. But as the day progressed, we would reconcile ourselves to spending more time on the vessel and waiting for something to happen,"" Sumantra recounted.He would not call his wife for days because hearing her voice made him more depressed. He particularly dreaded Thursdays. ""Friday and Saturday are holidays in the UAE and Sunday is a holiday in India. So, Thursday evening meant nothing would happen over the next three days,"" the engineer said.Home for son's b'dayFleet Management India Pvt Ltd, the company mediating in the payment dispute, made a breakthrough in negotiations early this month. The deal was that Sumantra and six others would be released.The engineer had wanted to be home for wife Manjari's birthday on November 3. He arrived on November 8, just in time for younger son Riddhiman's birthday.""I still feel confined and don't feel like going out of home. I hope to get over it soon,"" Sumantra said."

Pictures by Sudeshna BanerjeeShe came to CK Block, where her in-laws live as a joint family, as a new bride 24 years ago. Her brother-in-laws son Shashank, then just three years old, was devoted to her, because, among other reasons, Chachi was a fabulous cook.My school friends wanted to come home just for the food she would rustle up. She knew Marwari food and she would also make ravioli and risotto. She would cook Dum Pukht Biryani actually in a pot, says Shashank Agarwal of his aunt and now business partner Sarika Agarwal.The aunt-nephew duo started with a small health food joint as a franchisee for a year opposite Bengal Tennis Academy. But that did not work. People wanted a fulfiling meal. So they have now opened Studio Cafe at the same spot. Opening a cafe was always my dream. I told Shashank: Just give me a carpenter and a painter, I will do the rest. I purchased everything for the decor.Studio Cafe is a combination of a studio on the first floor and a cafe downstairs. The first floor is let out for parties for which the catering is done by the cafe. In the weekends, we host workshops, says Sarika.On the ground floor, the cafe is a 45-seater, part of which is designed to be let out separately. We have planned our menu like a delis, incorporating dishes from Continental, Thai and Chinese cuisine, says Shashank.A highlight of the food served is the option of avoiding flour in the list of ingredients used. Even our pizzas and pastas are wheat-based though we can make normal versions too in case a guest insists on it. Pizzas are all thin-crust.Similarly, their risottos are made with barley, oats or quinoa, instead of rice. Our Panini sandwiches are wheat-based too.In some dishes, she has given a Marwari touch. Our paneer fritters are wrapped with papad, Sarika smiles.Her teenaged son Krish loves parking himself at the joint when he is hungry after tennis lessons. He loves the mojitos, smoothies and hot chocolate that they make here, Sarika smiles. We also keep protein shakes for gym-goers and kids favourites like potato wedges.Why avoid wheat: Some experts believe that giving up not just gluten, but wheat altogether, could lead to weight loss and health benefits. Aside from some extra fiber, eating two slices of whole wheat bread is really little different, and often worse, than drinking a can of sugar-sweetened soda or eating a sugary candy bar, cardiologist William Davis writes in Wheat Belly.Dish of our pick: Chicken Malay Laksa, a thick gravy dish with a touch of lemongrass that is proof of its Far East origin. It has babycorn, broccoli, beans, zucchini and chicken underneath a forest of crisp rice noodles placed in a heap on top.Spot that caught our eye: A cosy alcove for two where a pair of lovers can snuggle. Not for plus-size individuals though."

The bizarre demand for surgery on a documentary could be seen as part of a general phenomenon which is narrowing the spectrum of thought and expression by a thousand cuts.At least 60 children, many of them encephalitis patients, died in a Gorakhpur hospital last week, 30 of them in the past four days. Reports have described a shortage of oxygen supply to intensive care units in Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital where the children were admitted  the UP government has denied that the cut in supply was the cause of the deaths. But encephalitis has been a scourge in Gorakhpur for nearly 40 years  and it has not been addressed by successive governments with the urgency it deserves.According to conservative estimates, 25,000 people have succumbed to it since the disease was first reported in the area in 1978  more than 50 of them this year, before last weeks pestilence. The latest tragedy confirms that the Yogi Adityanath government has treated the festering public health crisis in Gorakhpur  which also happens to be the chief ministers constituency  with the same criminal apathy, even as it seems to have prioritised polarising issues, like setting up anti-Romeo squads and devising patriotism tests for madrasas in the state.Encephalitis is a viral disease that mosquitoes transmit to humans from pigs. In most cases, it causes a mild fever and headache that recede within a few days. But one in 250 people develop high fever, severe headache and neck stiffness that exacerbates into seizures, paralysis and coma. At times, survivors are left with serious disabilities, mental and physical. In 2006, a study in the journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases, pointed out why Gorakhpur is prone to the virulent form of the disease.An abundance of rice fields and a bowl-shaped landscape that allows water to collect in pools create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Since then, several studies and reports have highlighted the link between poor sanitation facilities, open defecation and encephalitis in eastern UP where Gorakhpur is located. Yet uncovered drains, clogged sewers and garbage-strewn streets remain a common sight in the region. Gonda, which sends a large number of encephalitis patients to the Baba Raghav Das Medical College Hospital every year, has been named the worst performing district in the Swachh Bharat Survey this year.The hospital, itself an example of all that continues to be wrong with public health management in the country, is the only institution within a 300 sq km area with facilities to treat encephalitis and other infectious disease. Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of an AIIMS at Gorakhpur. While the setting up of such an institution is welcome, encephalitis can be best combated by strengthening primary healthcare facilities. Epidemiological studies have shown that lives of encephalitis patients can be saved if they receive immediate treatment from trained doctors and are not forced to travel long distances to access medical care. Last weeks tragedy is a grim reminder to the UP government  it has work to do, it must reset its priorities.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) He knew that they were warm and hospitable if treated with respect and as equals. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)An interesting anecdote about a great Indian soldier, Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa, is lodged in my memory since childhood. As a habit, I keep asking questions. I had asked a question about Cariappa Park during my school days. Nobody had an answer till the senior political leader from Baramulla, Sheikh Mohammad Akbar, told me a fascinating story of how he had fulfilled the desire of the people of Baramulla, as chairman of the Town Area Committee, to commemorate Cariappa.Once, after chasing the raiders beyond Uri, Cariappa was stopped by a group of people at Baramulla and told that they had suffered a lot due to the absence of food supplies, including salt. It was a puzzling question for the general, as no stocks were available with the army. But he fulfilled his assurance the next day when he visited the old town and distributed flour, rice and salt to the most needy families. He followed this gesture in many ways in various parts of Kashmir. K.S. Thimayya, whom he had put in command of the 19th Infantry Division at Baramulla, followed Cariappa in this regard. Grateful Baramullians named a park after Cariappa and the park exists even today.My quest to learn more about Cariappa was deepened when I heard some commanders in Kashmir asserting during the recent turmoil that yes, stones would be answered through bullets and pellets. The people of Kashmir feel this attitude has been encouraged after Major Nitin Leetul Gogoi was awarded for using a civilian as a human shield in Budgam.The Indian armys history tells us that Cariappa showed great valour as a commander and the success he obtained was squarely his own. But many people in India may not know that apart from his military valour, he employed another natural tool as a workable mechanism to deal with the people all around including the enemy. Reading authors like B.C. Khanduri, J.S. Bindra, S.K. Sinha, L.P. Sen, K.C. Cariappa and others, I came to know of many interesting stories woven around the personality of that great soldier. When I came to know of Cariappas Waziristan experience, I was flabbergasted.In June 1939, Cariappa was transferred to the 1st Battalion of the Rajput Regiment which became his parent unit. The battalion moved to Waziristan and he had to spend three years there. He was posted Waziristan in 1922 as well.In November 1945, Cariappa was finally given command of a brigade. He was posted as commander of the Bannu Frontier Brigade in Waziristan. Having served in the NWFP as a young officer, Cariappa was conversant with the terrain as well as the habits of the Pathan tribesmen who lived in the area. He had seen that the British policy of trying to keep them under control by force had not succeeded and he resolved to try a different method. He decided to win the hearts and minds of the tribesmen by extending a hand of friendship. He knew that they were warm and hospitable if treated with respect and as equals.One day, while passing through a village, he saw a group of Pathan women carrying pitchers of water. When he found out that they had to fetch water daily from another village, four miles away, he immediately ordered a well to be dug near their own village. He followed this gesture with many similar deeds. The Pathans were overwhelmed and started calling him Khalifa. Later, when the region was torn by communal strife, Bannu remained a haven of peace thanks to the goodwill generated by Cariappa. When Jawaharlal Nehru visited Bannu in 1945 as head of the Interim Government, Cariappa organised a public meeting which was attended by all tribal leaders. The next day, when he visited Razmak where another brigade was stationed, Nehru was fired upon by the tribesmen and the visit had to be called off. Nehru was impressed by Cariappas leadership qualities and rapport with the tribesmen.Veekays History Book (Victory of Knowledge Global Publications) tells us an interesting story about Cariappa. In February 1946, he was appointed Presiding Officer of one of the General Court Martials constituted to try members of the Indian National Army (INA). Before the trial, he visited some of the detention camps, where the prisoners were lodged. He found them full of rancour and hatred against the British for treating them badly and holding them without trial. Cariappa was pained by their plight and wrote to the Adjutant General, requesting him to expedite the trials. He also recommended that some of them such as Shah Nawaz Khan, G.S. Dhillon and P.K. Sehgal should be pardoned. But, when as Chief of the Armed Forces he was to consider the recommendation to accommodate Indian National Army (INA) personnel including Shahnawaz, Dhillon and Sehgal and he refused to take them into the Indian Army, particularly for the reason that they would bring politics into the Army. There was a lot of pressure on him for this and Nehru relented only after Cariappa threatened to resign on this issue.I invested some more time to understand both sides of Cariappas character. He was a very tough general when it came to leading the armed forces, as was required by military ethics, and he never compromised his principles.B.C. Khanduri, who worked with him as operations staff officer, says in his book Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa; His life and Times that, Once between Mahura and Uri, he was snipped at from close quarters. He showed no signs of fear while his staff officers perspired.Lt. Col. J.S. Bindra, as intelligence and liaison officer with Cariappa recalls in his book an incident at Srinagar. He says: The 268 Infantry Brigade was without a commander for a few days. Cariappa informed Army Headquarters to post Brigadier Bikram Singh. He (Bikram Singh) represented to the army that his relations with Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, the then Deputy PM of J&K, were not too friendly and that Bakshi might create problems for him in his command.Cariappa asked him what else? Then, he told Bikram to put his ego in his pocket and do what he desired him to do. Bikram was in Tithwal by the same night and on the job.The other side of his character is described in Veekays History Book: While Cariappa admonished Thimayya for lighting a cigarette while travelling in an Army vehicle, he asked the driver to stop to allow Thimayya to smoke.Lt. General Sen in his book, Slender was the Thread: Kashmir Confrontation 1947-48, describes another quality which Cariappa possessed and it was his broad-mindedness. He says, He treated all troops the same and was utterly free of any parochial feelings. He was best known for his love for the Indian soldier. Troops not only loved him, they worshipped him. But then, he never pardoned if anybody indulged in a crime.Cariappa is no more but his philosophy of military leadership is available to us. Many retired and serving generals have emphasised again and again that there is no military solution to the Kashmir dispute. It has to be resolved through methods other than force. I am confident that the spirit of Cariappas soldiery would be a better guide at this critical juncture of the Unions relationship with Kashmir.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The aroma and taste of these ethnic food items are unique. These traditional cuisines, tasty and nutritious, have remained unexplored. Most people in the cities do not know about the value and flavour of these dishes and I am sure our customers will love them, said Ankit Khachi, executive chef of Trident Hotel, Bhubaneswar.Exotic preparations such as kanti, a sweet dish made of black gram cakes coated with sugar syrup, lauki ka paratha and lauki pitha (rice-based flatbread flavoured with bottle gourd), mischi ka saag (a kind of spinach), pani kakharu (water gourd) halwa, muga kakara (moong dal cakes) and mansa pitha (chicken and rice flatbread cooked between sal leaves), bamboo shoot pickle and cakes made of mohua flower were the biggest hits among the chefs. People are becoming more and more health conscious, and eating traditional food is becoming popular nowadays. Most of the items displayed here are slowly getting lost.We would love to introduce some of them in our Odia food restaurant, said Bijay Parida , chef, Mayfair Convention . More than 80 varieties of ethnic food were displayed at the exhibition by people of different communities residing in and around Sukinda. Among these were 30 varieties of traditional cakes, 10 types of rice, 25 curries, and 35 dishes using roots and tubers. The aim behind organizing the food festival is to encourage conservation and promotion of ethnic and tribal foods. This is part of a series of initiatives we have been taking to contribute to the National Biodiversity Target of 2020, said R R Satapathy, general manager, SCM.The festival also provided an opportunity to the tribal women to showcase their traditional culinary skills. Most of the dishes are not cooked these days due to changing lifestyles and the unavailability of many ingredients. If these dishes are included in the menus of big hotels, people can taste them and the items will become popular again, said Baijayanti Murmu of Bhelutangar village in Dhenkanal district."

(AP Photo/Dar Yasin) Rohingya Muslims walk to shore after arriving on a boat from Myanmar to Bangladesh in Shah Porir Dwip, Bangladesh, Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017. (AP Photo/Dar Yasin)The Indian governments stance on the Rohingya refugees from Rakhine state in Myanmar is from a security point of view, imprudent; from a historical point of view, myopic; and from a moral point of view, untenable. In its legal and political statements, the Indian government has, for all practical purposes, declared the Rohingya to be illegal immigrants not refugees, threatened their deportation and has declared them to be a security threat. These claims have rickety foundations.The current debate in India is being constructed as one between humanitarian obligations and national security. Those advocating a more accommodative stance towards the Rohingya are being cast as bleeding-heart moralists with no concern for Indias security. This way of constructing our choices is an intellectual mistake and already loads the dice in favour of the Indian governments stance. No sensible person will deny that India has to, first and foremost, look after its own security. But treating the Rohingya as illegal migrants will diminish rather than enhance Indias security for a number of reasons.It is clear that the Rohingya are being subjected to something that is moving closer to ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar government has been using a hugely exaggerated pretext of radicalisation to unleash violence and expulsion on a whole ethnic group. If there is one thing we know from recent history it is this. Radicalisation grows when three conditions obtain: Groups are subjected to political violence and marginalisation, not democratic incorporation. States lose control over territory partly because their own repression destroys the normal fabric of civil society. And other states that side with the repressing state also evoke resentment and become a target.Even in Europe, the Bosnian wars were a trigger of radicalisation in other parts of the world. By basically condoning the Myanmar governments actions, by not securing assistance for stateless people, India, in effect, might help create the conditions for greater radicalisation. By also declaring a whole refugee community as a national security threat, largely on communal lines, it is also aligning itself with the states that are deepening communal conflict.India has also implicitly put all its eggs in the basket of the Myanmar government. This is a mistake. It is increasingly clear that states do not find it easy to control territories in the aftermath of deep violent conflict. We are relying on Myanmars promise to rehabilitate the refugees, when it is precisely that governments policies that are, in substantial part, creating the push factor in the first place. It is not clear that the Myanmar government will have the ability to deliver stability in our border areas since it has allowed the situation to fester in the first place. We will not be able to contain the spillovers across our porous borders if we have alienated communities living on our borders. So, pinning all hopes in a government that may not be able to control the situation is imprudent from a security point of view.Finally, there is a talk of radicalisation amongst the Rohingya; they are also being linked to terrorist threats. Let us for a moment suppose that there is some possibility of small sections being tempted in that direction. It is precisely to isolate them that you need a more imaginative refugee policy. Such a policy in all likelihood will ensure that their numbers will not grow. A proper system of identification, rehabilitation, and possibly reporting in India, which might allow you to actually understand the dynamics within the community, will be better than pushing them to a wall, where they are crushed between two states.There is this rather curious matter of how a group of Rohingya refugees ended up in Jammu in the first place. This has now become an issue in domestic politics.; and the government often gives the sense that the policy is more about catering to its core ideological constituency than it is about addressing a serious problem. If we actually had a proper asylum law, and better processing mechanisms for refugees, even this situation could have been avoided. In short, there are prudent security reasons, for treating the Rohingya with more dignity and political finesse than our security mandarins seem to muster.Our stance is historically myopic, since of all countries, India understands the dynamics of ethnic conflict more deeply. India has been exemplary in the way it accommodated refugees from Tibet, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. It is right to say that the West should not lecture us. But India aspires to be a great power. Its biggest asset is the way it has been the significant open society of the region. In the larger scheme of things, India had escaped radicalisation in large part because of its success in democratic incorporation, and it was not identified with persecutory ideologies of the state or of other states. The political construct we have put around the Rohingya weakens the ideological projection that has been Indias greatest security strength. India is, in a sense, betraying its own historical heritage.Finally, our stance is morally obtuse. As Devirupa Mitra of The Wire pointed out, India has now changed its stance on an important moral principle: The principle of non-refoulement. This principle stops nations from returning people to a country where they might be at risk of severe persecution. Even if India is not a signatory to International Refugee Conventions, it takes a very pinched up moral imagination to forcibly send back people who will in all likelihood face persecution. There is something disquieting about a country that wants others to have open borders for its rich and privileged, but will not help those who show up at its door because of palpable threats to their lives. In humanitarian terms also, Indian policy is a pittance. To put it somewhat rhetorically, a few sacks of rice to Bangladesh is now what passes of as a humanitarian strategy.The problem with our current strategy is not that it is placing security over humanitarianism. It is that it is doing so in a way that is imprudent and likely to be self-defeating.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty) Despite impressive economic growth in the last two decades, inequalities and injustices are pervasive. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)As we approach our 71st Independence Day, one cannot help but reflect on where we stand as a nation. I can think of no better way to assess our progress than to measure it against the noble aspirations enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution which spells out our resolve to secure justice, liberty, equality for every citizen and promote fraternity among all. How far have we progressed on this commitment? Our Constitution should have helped us create a truly egalitarian society but the power elite has failed miserably in ensuring equality and justice for all. Despite impressive economic growth in the last two decades, inequalities and injustices are pervasive. According to World Bank estimates (2015), there has been a decline in Indias poverty rate but this is cold comfort  172 million citizens still live below the poverty line and constitute 24.5 per cent of the worlds poor.That the neoliberal juggernaut has trumped distributive justice is evident from the fact that Indias richest one per cent now hold 58 per cent of the nations wealth. A great blot on our society is the prevalence of manual scavenging despite stringent laws prohibiting it. There are about 2.6 million dry latrines across the country that require manual cleaning, a loathsome task imposed on the Dalits of all religions by social sanction. That is not all. Although elaborate laws specifically aimed at protecting Dalits are in place, there is no let-up in the atrocities against this group. According to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, there were 54,355 registered cases, including rape, murder and arson committed against Dalits in 2015 compared to 39,408 cases in 2013.Another arena darkened by injustice and inequality is rural India where 68 per cent of our people live. India is today self-sufficient in agriculture, is the biggest exporter of rice in the world, the biggest producer of milk and second-largest producer of fruits and vegetables. The farming community made this happen. Yet unending waves of farmer suicides are overt manifestations of an on-going human tragedy. They are victims of an iniquitous system where even bumper harvests do not ensure reasonable profits; where there is no insurance against the vagaries of nature or volatility of the market; where the governments focus is on containing food inflation in cities with hardly a thought to whether the producer is adequately remunerated; where the governing class obsesses about smart cities and bullet trains while rural India remains without basic infrastructure.Our founding fathers had underlined fraternity as a vital ingredient for building a vibrant democracy. Jawaharlal Nehru had cautioned that it is the responsibility of the dominant community not to use its position in any way which might prejudice the secular ideal of the nation. After Partition, there was animosity between Hindus and Muslims but that has abated over time. However, since the late 1980s, the mutual suspicion and distrust have intensified, and the country is witnessing a majoritarian assault on the Muslim and his way of life. Lynching for beef eating and suspicion of cow slaughter has become virtually quotidian. Politicians have been fishing in troubled waters by instigating the worst elements in both communities. With even educational institutions and cultural bodies purveying the gospel of hate, what we see today is an overpowering communalisation of the public space. The social gulf between the two communities that seems to be widening poses a greater threat to the nations well-being than terrorism or Pakistan.Extreme gender inequality and intolerance to dissent are further manifestations of a deeply polarised society. I am reminded of what James Baldwin, the great Afro-American novelist observed in 1963 about white racists, the powerful and the wealthy in America: I am terrified at the moral apathy, the death of the heart that is happening in this country. We all need a change of heart.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b5061069855b708a7ccc160,No hope for better rate for Vid paddy growers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-hope-for-better-rate-for-vid-paddy-growers/articleshow/62109992.cms,2017-12-18,"Nagpur: Paddy growers of the region, hit by pest attack on their crop, have little chances that shortfall in output would lead to rates of the commodity escalate and cover their losses. This year rice millers are paying Rs3,200 a quintal. Its higher than the last year when the prices were in the range of Rs2,700-2,900 a quintal.Farmers claim that the pest has damaged nearly 50% of the crop. The rates have to be Rs3,600 at least to earn a profit. Independent sources in the paddy growing area of east Vidarbha also say that the current price is only enough to break-even not leaving any surplus at the cultivators hands.Apart from pest attack, there are farms where paddy was not grown at all due to delayed rains.A low supply can pull up the prices. Paddy is fetching a higher price as against last year, which the farmers say is not enough. Traders say that there is a little chance that the market rates will further go up.This is because the output in one region alone does not impact the market rates. Due to favourable rains, there has been a good crop in southern states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, on account of which the prices would remain range bound.The crop down south is in abundance and due to which the rates may even go down further. The local varieties of rice have touched Rs5,000 a quintal in the bulk market, which is the peak. As arrivals increase the rates may further go down now, said Pratap Motwani secretary of Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The rates have gone up marginally but that is not because of fall in output in Vidarbha. Such ups and down happen in normal course. There is enough crop in the south which can pull down the rates in coming days. Some increase can be expected by February-March when arrivals fall, said another trader.The higher rate of Rs3,200/quintal is available only if the farmers accept a post-dated cheque which can be encashed after nearly a month. For cash payment they have to settle at the last years rate of Rs2,800 to 2,900 a quintal.Paddy is grown in the districts of Bhandara, Gondia, Gadchiroli and parts of Chandrapur in East Vidarbha. It is the only crop taken by farmers in large parts of the districts.Farmers cannot wait till March and want money right after the harvest. Even at Rs3,200 a quintal it is not enough to recover the cost. Though it is slightly more than last years level the losses due to pest attack are much more, said Deepak Hazare a farmer in Karachkheda village of Bhandara districtAs against 50 bags, the yield has come down to 25. There is no profit at even Rs3,200. In case a farmer wants cash payment then the rates are not more than Rs2,900 a quintal, said Sanjay Nimbarte of Chandori village in the district."
5b50612c9855b70b4a41a9ff,From Plate to Plough: Lessons for the field,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-punjab-agriculture-lessons-for-the-field-green-revolutions-heyday-gdp-growth-4753622/,2017-07-17,"(Illustration by Subrata Dhar) (Illustration by Subrata Dhar)Punjab was Indian agricultures star performer during the Green Revolutions heyday. The state averaged an agri-GDP growth of 5.7 per cent per annum between 1972 to 1986, more than double the all-India average of 2.3 per cent in the same period. But thereafter, the Green Revolution began to gray. The growth rate of Punjabs agriculture fell to 3 per cent per between 1987 to 2005  almost the same as that of the 2.9 per cent growth rate registered by the country in agriculture during this period. Between 2006 and 2015, the states agri-growth rate plummeted to 1.6 per cent  less than half the all-India average of 3.5 per cent (see Graph 1). During this period, states such as Madhya Pradesh registered a growth rate of more than 9 per cent in agriculture.It is not that Punjab has a high value of agri-output per ha that is slowing down its growth rate. The state is nowhere near the top in that ranking (see Graph 2). Getting the state back to a 5 per cent growth path is thus a matter of serious concern. Punjab used to have the highest per capita income amongst the 21 large states of the country till 2003. But it has slipped to the seventh position, and unless there are drastic policy changes, the state is going to slip further.Punjab is endowed with one of the best possible infrastructures for agriculture in the country. It has the highest irrigation cover amongst all states  98.5 per cent of its cropped area is irrigated. Almost 80 per cent of irrigation is from groundwater sources, facilitated by highly subsidised power. Power subsidy in the states current budget has crossed Rs 7,000 crore. This is much higher than the subsidy provided to any other agricultural input. Much of the large power subsidy goes into the cultivation of rice, a water-intensive crop  it requires 25 rounds of irrigation in a season. The power subsidy, then, is leading to the depletion of the states water table. Punjabs water table receded at the rate of 70 cm per year during 2008 to 2012  110 of the 132 blocks have been declared as over-exploited. This is the biggest bane of Punjab agriculture.Punjab does have advantages in other areas. Almost all villages in the state are connected with pucca all-weather roads. The network of regulated mandis in Punjab is one of the best in the country. A robust and fast-moving procurement system has reduced the market risks of wheat and paddy growers in the state. Almost 90 per cent of the market arrivals is procured at the minimum support price (MSP). But this system has also made Punjabs farmers risk averse. This is today the biggest bottleneck in farmers diversifying from the wheat-rice cycle, which occupies more than 83 per cent of Punjabs cropped area.What can be done to make Punjabs agriculture sustainable, especially with respect to its groundwater resources, without hurting farmers incomes? Diversification from common rice to hybrid maize is one option, which can save power subsidy and groundwater, and yet give farmers almost the same income as paddy. But farmers are reluctant to switch to maize because there is no effective procurement system for this crop. Our suggestion to the Punjab government is to tap the savings in power subsidy  roughly Rs 10,000/ha  which could accrue once farmers switch from paddy to maize. The state could use these savings to cover the risk of maize farmers by promoting feed mills for poultry and silage units for milch cattle and encouraging starch industries that use maize.With the new GST regime coming into force, the processing industry could be incentivised to prefer Punjab over other states in purchasing agricultural raw material. To help the state regain ecological balance, any losses on account of procurement may be borne by the Centre. Measures have to be taken to offset the reduction in the area under paddy in Punjab (except basmati, which delivers much higher price to farmers). There should be vigorous efforts to increase productivity and procurement of rice in the eastern states which get much higher rainfall and are more suitable for paddy cultivation. Simultaneously, Punjab should promote the use of micro-irrigation, especially for sugarcane and fruits and vegetables.The dairy and meat industries are other sources of diversification for Punjabs agriculturalists. The state has the highest yield of milch animals in the country and its per capita consumption of milk is also the highest in the country. But the state processes just about 10 per cent of the milk it produces  Gujarat, in contrast, processes about half of the milk it produces. Punjab needs to incentivise private and cooperative dairies to invest in processing milk and milk products. It should target a 20 per cent increase in processed milk in the next five years. More than 67 per cent of milch animals in Punjab are buffaloes. If the state can eradicate the foot and mouth disease, buffalo meat from Punjab can be sold at premium rates in international markets, ultimately benefiting the states dairy farmers.The states farmers should also diversify towards fruit and vegetables. Less than 3 per cent of the cropped area in Punjab is under fruit and vegetables. This needs to go up to 10 per cent over the next five years. However, the government will need to invest in marketing infrastructure for fruit and vegetables, as it did for grains by creating a robust mandi infrastructure. With protected cultivation and an integrated cold chain, backed by a robust food processing industry, Punjab can tap the market for fresh and processed produce in West Asia and Central Asian countries. A modern expressway from Khanna to Kandla could be helpful in the faster transportation of fruit and vegetables.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The farmers will first prepare porridge with the new rice and then start selling the rice to traders.Speaking to TOI, agriculture department joint director for the district G Rama Rao said they are expecting at least 10.8 lakh metric tonnes of paddy yield from a total of 5,23,864 acres of paddy fields in the district in this kharif season.Due to some abnormal weather conditions like heavy rains under the influence of a depression over the Bay of Bengal last month, we are expecting that the total paddy yield would be less than our expectations of 10.8 lakh metric tonnes, but it will definitely cross 9 lakh metric tonnes, Rama Rao added.Rao said the paddy yield would be around two tonnes per hectare (2.47 acres) in mandals like Sompeta and Tekkali due to bad weather conditions. More than 5.2 tonnes per hectare was yielded from mandals like Palakonda, Rajam and Ranasthalam mandals which did not face any kind of disturbance from the weather, he added.Overall, the average paddy yield is 4.4 tonnes per hectar this year in the kharif season. Nearly 98% of the harvesting of the crop was over. By Sankranti, entire harvesting would be completed and the farmers would cook porridge with the new rice, Rao added.Rao said that the minimum supportive price (MSP) of paddy fixed by the government is Rs 1100 per quintal."

By pilfering foodgrains meant for the scheme and making a killing by selling it in the open market, theyre doing a great disservice to the intended beneficiaries. While carping critics may claim that Siddaramaiah is milking the schemes pouplarity for political gain, theres no denying that the scheme was designed to provide BPL families with foodgrains and other essential commodities. Black marketeers should be arrested and heavily penalized to deter others from doingit.BENGALURU: Anna Bhagya  the Siddaramaiah governments flagship programme that seeks to rid the state of hunger  is being breached by black marketeers. A review has revealed that 430 attempts have been made to steal and sell Anna Bhagya foodgrains in the past four years.According to the food & civil supplies department, 491 black marketeers have been arrested since the schemes rollout in July 2013. Pilferage is a major issue crippling the scheme, but were making all efforts to contain it, said an IAS officer. Rice and wheat are the favourites of black marketeers  in 2016-17, while 6,817 quintals of pilfered rice (costing Rs 2.76 crore) was seized, 6,006 quintals of wheat (worth Rs 1.81 crore) was recovered.Sources in the department said Siddaramaiah has ordered a crackdown against those who divert foodgrains from the public distribution system to the black market. The Anna Bhagya scheme tops the list of Siddaramaiahs achievements. He talks about it at all public functions and plans to win over rural masses by showcasing it in the run-up to the polls, an official in the chief ministers office said.The scheme covers around 1.08 crore BPL families. A member of a BPL family is entitled to free supply of 7kgs of rice and 1kg of wheat. Cooking oil is supplied at Rs 25 per litre and an iodised salt packet for Rs 2. The government feels the scheme has reduced migration of labour from rural areas to urban centres, especially in the last four drought seasons.The greatest challenge is the holes being drilled by black marketeers, basically a cartel comprising officials, ration shop operators and traders in the open market. Several legislators expressed fears about black marketing hitting the scheme and urged the government to take strict measures. Food & civil supplies minister U T Khader acknowledged there have been instances of pilferage."

But last month, Chapal Bhaduri or Chapalrani, the last female imitator of Bengal, checked into an old-age home in north Kolkata. With neither a permanent address nor any family member to take care of him, the septuagenarian thespian moved into Ramkrishna Old Age Home on Hari Ghosh Street on November 15.According to Prabir Paul, manager of the home, Bhaduri's day starts at 6am. ""He gets his bed tea at 6.30am and has breakfast by 8.30am. Earlier, he would have an egg-and-toast breakfast, but now he prefers roti-sabzi. For lunch, we serve rice, sabzi and fish, and later, a variety of snacks - from chowmein to cakes. Though he eats rotis at dinner, we served him overcooked rice for five days when he had a tooth problem,"" said Paul.Though Bhaduri likes to spend his time alone in his fourth-floor room, he is friendly with all the boarders. ""Every time he bumps into someone, he makes it a point to smile. We have 24 residents and they are all aware of the fact that he is a recipient of the Banga Bhushan award,"" added Paul. Bhaduri doesn't watch television and didn't ask for any, but all his basic requirements are taken care of by the home, owned by Kashinath Roy, against a monthly payment of Rs 9,000. ""Though we take a security deposit of Rs 5-10 lakh, we took Rs 2 lakh from Bhaduri,"" said Paul, adding that the thespian is often visited by his nieces. When Bhaduri goes out to meet his relatives, they call to enquire if he had reached the home safely.Bhaduri reportedly began his journey by playing a female character in 'Ali Baba' and followed it up with several performances in 'Raja Debidas', 'Chand Bibi', 'Sultana Razia' and 'Mahiyashi Kaikeyi'. It was only in 2006 that his first full-length role as a male character came about with the semi-autobiographical 'Ramanimohan'.But Bhaduri continues to play the 'leading lady' on stage. He got under the skin of Sachima in 'Noder Nimai' for Binapani Samiti , a group he has been working with for the past 17 years. The performance was held at Ramakrishna Math, Kankurgachi, on December 9.In fact, it was one of his stage associates Rakesh Ghosh who first disclosed Bhaduri's new address on social media. ""He used to live in Belgachhia in his sister Ketaki Dutta 's apartment. But it was not his house and after a change in arrangements, he decided to move out.""Though many of his associates hinted at a family feud, Bhaduri said, ""I am my own guardian and I will not speak about my life."""

Once you allow construction on a section of the wetlands, it will open the floodgates to further encroachment.Much of EKW has been lost already. If the government implements the proposal, we will oppose it legally, Datta added.The 125sqkm EKW acts as a natural sewage treatment plant for Kolkata. It provides fish, rice and vegetables at the citys doorstep. If EKW disappears, the city will have to spend a fortune on sewage treatment and stormwater evacuation facilities. Cost of living will also soar.Bonani Kakkar, founder president of the NGO, Public, said, The proposal is ill-conceived and malicious. While a wetland management plan has been devised to protect the eco-system, this is designed to destroy it. We cannot allow this attempt to subvert the law.Kakkars public interest litigation led to the 1992 landmark judgment protecting the wetlands and its subsequent recognition as a Ramsar site a decade later.Green activists also countered environment minister and mayor Sovan Chatterjees claim that he was unaware of the proposal. They said it fits neatly into his scheme of things.Immediately after becoming the mayor for the second term, Chatterjee spoke about the need to regularise buildings that had been illegally constructed in EKW. Later, after taking over as East Kolkata Wetlands Management Authority (EKWMA) chairman following an amendment, he pushed through a proposal to set up an entertainment park and a flyover on the wetlands. The latest proposal in the draft tender for a management plan will remove the hurdles in its way.A member of the EKWMA steering committee also opposed the plan.Ecologist Dhrubajyoti Ghosh said, The entire area has been notified as wetlands. An attempt is being made to exclude Dhapa and adjoining moujas from EKW. This will spell doom for the wetlands.This is not the first time that a management plan is being attempted. In 1999, the Calcutta Environment Management & Strategy Action Plan (CEMSAP) commissioned by the state environment department and UKs DfID was prepared by Centre for Environment & Development (Endev). It mooted the idea of core and buffer areas. No activities were to be allowed in the core areas and activities that would not harm the wetlands were to be permitted.Endev director Ashish Ghosh, who had led the Indian Ramsar team to the UN conference in Japan in 1995, said The plan was prepared keeping in mind the historical judgment of Justice UC Banerjee. Any attempt to subvert it will be contempt of court."

Jethvas research also suggests that the increase in crop fires (about 500 per year between 2002 and 2016) could be linked to rising crop production in the region.He analysed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on Aqua satellite to track annual crop fire numbers. In his blog on the Nasa Earth Observatory website published earlier this year, Jethva also analysed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)  a measure for greenness that can indicate crop or vegetation cover.There seems to be a one-on-one relationship in NDVI measured by the MODIS sensor prior to harvest (September) and the total number of fire hotspots observed during the harvest season (October and November). This suggest that the increase in the number of fires is likely related to increasing crop production, the blog says.Jethva also refers to data from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics , department of agriculture, which says post-monsoon, rice crop production has increased at a linear rate of 0.18 million tonnes from 2002 to 2016 in Punjab. On November 5 last year, Delhi had suffered its worst smog episode in 17 years with average PM2.5 levels 14 times the 24-hour standard. In October-November last year, there were nearly 18,000 crop fires in Punjab and Haryana put together  the highest since 2002. The number of fires reduced in 2017  to a little more than 12,000  but still had a huge impact on air quality in NCR, according to experts.The impact of crop fires on air quality is accentuated by hostile meteorological conditions. During this smog episode, for example, ground wind speed was very low on most days, but wind direction was from north and northwest through Punjab and Haryana where crop stubble is being burnt over large stretches.IMD said mixing heights (also called boundary conditions)  the levels at which ground level winds mix with the higher winds and allow dispersion  has been extremely low, leading to a high concentration of pollution particles. But crop fires are also ruining soil health and depleting groundwater resources massively in these states. According to Ramanjaneyulu G V, executive director at Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , burning also leads to an immediate decline in the bacterial and fungal population in the top 2.5cm of the soil.Repeated burning permanently diminishes the bacterial population by more than 50%, increasing farmers dependence on fertlisers and pesticides. He added that the problem of crop stubble burning started increasing since 2002. The depletion of groundwater levels made Punjab come up with a law in 2009, which makes sowing of paddy before June 15 a criminal offence. The law allows agriculture department officers to destroy the nursery or transplanted paddy. The uprooting costs are to be borne by farmers. The Act levies a penalty of Rs10,000 per hectare per month on the farmers who contravene it. It even allows field officers to disconnect power supply to a farmers field till the notified date if the farmer is found violating the law repeatedly. This left a very small window for farmers between kharif harvest and rabi sowing, forcing them to resort to burn off, Ramanjaneyulu said. He added: The prices of paddy have not increased in the last 10 years. As a result, farmers also felt spending more amount on removal of stubbles is not economically viable  so they burn off.Farmers from various farmer groups, including the Bharatiya Kisan Union, say an important factor could be increasing labour costs, which have led to more farmers taking up mechanised harvesting by using combines to harvest both paddy and wheat. Labour costs have increased drastically, its very difficult to find labour as well. So, more and more farmers have no option but to use combines to harvest crop, which leaves a stubble of about 1.5 feet. Earlier, once manually harvested, the stubble was used for fodder and manure, but you need labour to do all that. When you can generate electricity, make paper with crop stubble, why isnt it being done? asks Dharmendra Kumar of BKU.Kumar alleged that the reason farmers are being blamed now with these studies is because people in cities dont want to restrict their polluting cars. They want to live in comfort and blame the farmers for pollution.Many farmers say they want to give up paddy cultivation, but cant  because procurement prices for other crops are not fair.Solutions lie in finding uses for the stubble and assigning real economic value to it, so that burning is an economic loss to the farmer. Solutions are well known, in terms of infield use as manure to reduce fertilizer cost or generate power, or make fuel and material. But there is no clear strategy to build business cases around these solutions to scale or provide support to farmers to use this as manure, said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of Centre for Science and Environments clean air campaign."

Apart from the Bhangar protests, several incidents of communal riots have been reported from across the state since September.Watch what else is making newsMamata instead spoke of the hardhips faced by industries. Due to note ban, industries are now facing a lot of hardships. Especially smaller ones which are unable to make cash transactions. Economic growth has slowed down. Despite demonetisation, I invite you to come to Bengal and we will give you all the support that you need, she said.The chief minister reiterated many of the points she had mentioned in last years summit  industry output having doubled from 67 billion to 140 billion in a five-year span, tax revenue having doubled in four years, industrial growth rate having increased to 10.59 per cent in the year 2015-16 as opposed to the national industrial growth rate of 7.30 per cent, the service sector growing one and a half times faster in the state and the agricultural sector recording growth five times more than before.When we first came to power in the state, infant mortality rate was 32 per cent, now it is 26 per cent in Bengal.

She also highlighted the measures taken by the government to improve the social sector of the state.Notable industry leaders like Sanjeev Goenka of RP-Sanjiv Goenka group, Rajan Bharti Mittal of Airtel, Pankaj Munjal of Hero Motocorp and Kishore Biyani of Future group among others were present at the meet.I am committing an investment of Rs 10,000 crore in the FMCG sector in the state over the next few years, Goenka said at the inauguration. Stating that West Bengal is an investor-friendly state, he said: There is transparency in deals. There is no hitch, no delay West Bengal means business.Mittal said that the Bharti Group has pumped around Rs 30,000 crore in the state so far.We want to partner with the state government further. The Bharti Group will invest about Rs 3,000-4,000 crore in the state in the next 2-3 years, he said.

But why this tangy chutney of indignation at the innovation? The masala dosa, after all, is a many-splendoured thing, one of Indias most inventive dishes, always metamorphosing into delicious new forms.Unlike, say, rice and daal, the masala dosa comes cloaked in the glamour of a thousand rumours. One urban legend says the masala dosa wasnt created in cosy homesteads at all but actually dished up in Udupi restaurants, where clever cooks used spare potato bhaji, folding this in a light, crisp, savoury crepe. This masala dosa was a huge hit; but it didnt stop at one chewy avataar. Constantly innovating, the masala dosa features in hundreds of variants, localising, specialising and targeting individual customers well before multinationals learnt how to spell idli; versions include the paneer dosa, khakhra dosa, cheese spread dosa, even mutton-fry masala dosas. There are ragi and oat dosas for health nuts  and there are pizza dosas for those who prefer taste over waist.Why be mealy-mouthed over meals evolving anyway? Modern gastronomy means mixing, blending, breaking rules and combining cuisines, dishing up a brave new world of food, from bacon ice-cream to vegetarian chicken, foie gras falafel to charcoal chocolate. The West may be loving fusion cooking now but India has been a master-chef at this for decades. Remember, we invented the dhokla pizza, tandoori momo, paneer enchilada, masala omlette sushi and that most brilliant of culinary creations, which even slides cheekily past a stony Great Wall  gobi Manchurian.

Though wine making has become a rarity due to a ban on brewing wine for commercial and household purpose some still continue to make wine in small quantities as it is a favourite among the families during Christmas and Easter.Fort Kochi - based Alice Stanley is one among them. Born and brought up in one of the traditional Catholic families in the city, she is an expert in making wines and cakes. Though red wine is her favourite she also makes wines from raspberry, pineapple, plantain, mulberry, water rose apple, gooseberry and scramberry.On Christmas eve no dining table in Christian homes especially those of Catholic families would be complete without a sparkling red wine and rich, dark and luscious plum cakes filled with raisins, nuts and cherries. I use my grandmothers hand written recipe book to make wine for Christmas even today. So it has a different taste altogether as these recipes has been handed down by the family, said Alice Stanley, who believes sipping a cup of homemade wine can take her back to the good old Christmas memories and nostalgia.When asked if she can share her grandmothers red wine recipe, Alice said that the art of making good wine lies in the hands that make them. She added that though anyone can make wine it is practice that makes it perfect.According to Maria George, who runs a cooking school in Kochi, beetroot as well as water rose apples and raisin wines are in great demand during festive season along with red wines.I got the beetroot wine recipe from my aunt. Moreover beetroots are available in all seasons and it is cheap. At first I was reluctant to make as I was worried how it would turn out to be but I made it and got rave reviews from my family and friends. Only a good wine taster can make out it is beetroot wine. It is a healthy homemade wine which can be used as an alternative for traditional red wine. Similarly raisin and tea wines are also a good try, Maria said. Riya Lawrence Mathews, a wine expert feels that to enjoy each sip of wine one should know a great deal about it.Each wine is different from the other some may be sweet some will be sour. Also the level of fruitiness will be different in each wine. If you are looking for sweet varieties then one should try pudding wines, said Riya.When asked about why wines are the most preferred beverage, Riya said that there are several reasons behind this.First of all because of their low alcohol content, then it can be easily paired up with main course items during lunch and dinner. Flavours like ginger, tea, coffee, honey, and rice one also being accepted now. Above all for Christians it is a sacred liquid, she said."

The issue has generated a debate whether farmers of both the states should continue to cultivate paddy to contribute to the national foodgrain buffer stock or diversify into other crops and conserve their vital natural resources like water and soil.The Union government had started a programme Bringing Green Revolution in East India (BGREI) in 2010-11 to increase the output of foodgrains, especially paddy in seven eastern states to raise their agricultural output and reduce their dependence on the Centre to feed their population. As paddy output in these provinces goes up in coming years, the Centre may not procure rice from Punjab and Haryana, which could trigger a crisis in both states, if they dont adopt alternative crops and create a marketing system for farmers to sell their produce.While this could harm the interest of Punjab and Haryana farmers in the shortterm, it also could enable them to shift to other crops and allied sector activities like horticulture, dairying and agro-forestry to name a few to augment their incomes and learn ways to market their produce efficiently.Leading farm scientists and agri-economists have been suggesting the area under paddy cultivation in the region must be reduced. Speaking about reducing the area under paddy in Punjab, former vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Professor Kirpal Singh Aulakh , said, It is long overdue. I think it is a great opportunity to move to other crops as Punjab was never a paddy-growing state. It all started with the Green Revolution as paddy replaced crops like maize, groundnut and pulses. Today nearly 60% of Punjabs total geographical area is under paddy cultivation during kharif season, which is not a healthy trend. It is time to curtail rice cultivation as it is depleting groundwater of Punjab and also poses a threat to environment with the practice of stubble burning.He said to wean farmers away from water-guzzling paddy and, hence, stop the practice of stubble burning, they should be given an assurance of fair price for their other kharif crops like maize, urad (black gram) and moong (green gram). If farmers get the same return from maize or vegetables or pulses, there is no reason why they could not move away from paddy, said Prof Aulakh.Former professor of economics at PAU, Prof P S Rangi , who served as the marketing consultant in the Punjab State Farmers Commission (PSFC), said continuous cultivation of paddy was playing havoc with the environment and natural resources of Punjab. The sooner the farmers shift from paddy to other crops the better. However, they must be provided with the infrastructure to switch to other crops or allied activities so that their returns dont drop by moving away from paddy. For instance, cold chains are the need of the hour for supporting fruits and vegetable growers as these perishable commodities. This can enable farmers to get much higher returns than conventional crops like wheat and paddy, he observed."

The report added that these schools are either relying on conventional firewood as source for the preparation of meal or have an unofficial LPG connection. However, not a single school within the city limits has this issue, as all 185 schools are equipped with proper LPG connection.Subhash Chougule, education officer (primary), told TOI that out of 3,048 schools  both government and private that prepare mid-day meal on school days  only 1,992 schools have the official LPG connection. We are into the process of granting every remaining school an official connection. Headmasters of these schools have been instructed about the same. If everything goes smoothly, we may have all schools with a gas connection by the end of this academic year or even before that, he said. He added that to be an official connection it must be in the name of school headmaster.Now, many schools have gas connection in the name of self-help groups and as per rule it is still considered as unofficial. Meanwhile, the report added that out of the 12 talukas in the district eight have achieved the target of 100% gas connection. Kolhapur zilla parishad chief executive officer (CEO) Kunal Khemnar said that to comply with the guidelines, they are also focusing on better public participation and generate funds through CorporateSocial Responsibility (CSR) activities. According to the official, many schools in the rural and remote areas in the district are still using firewood for cookingmid-day meal and the state government had asked the schools to use LPG connection through public participation.Sattappa Mohite, a city-based education activist, said that increase in the use of LPG should be promoted and it is heartening to see that only around 1,000 schools are yet to get the connection.It should be noted that to stop the declining number of students in the schools, the mid-day meal scheme was introduced in the state in the year 1995. Earlier, the nature of the scheme was take home supplement type, under which students were given 3 kg rice every month. In 2001, after the Supreme Courts instruction, the mid-day meal scheme started with giving cooked food. Earlier this year, in order to promote transparency in the mid-day meal scheme in government aided schools, the state government had made keeping the online record of the ration used for the daily meals mandatory."

People of the village, which is 35km from Mysuru, claim that these relics date back to the era of the Chola kings. The team of researchers has also found other clay equipment, and relics of the Stone Age in the village.Reddy said, There is a lake in the village called namada Kola, and these cup-marks were traced close to the waterbody in the Giribetta area. The villagers call these cup-marks Nooraondu Oralukallu (101 grinding stones). They say that the Chola kings stayed here, and used these cup-marks to make rice from paddy.The historian said that there could be a possible connection between the unique manner in which Naivedyam  food offered to the Gods  was presented at the Honnadevi tempe at Sosale, T Narasipura. Locals offered the Naivedyam prepared from these cup-marks. So, we can discern a connection between these two villages, said Reddy.Pointing out that such cup-marks could be found in other states such as Goa, and across the Vindhya mountain ranges, Reddy said, They are proof of our ancient civilization.He said that articles that were 3,000 to 5,000 years old had been found at Hallada Manuganahalli. We believe that many of the relics we found could have been used by people in their daily life, Reddy added.Emphasising the need to preserve the relics, he added, The locals and the agencies concerned must work together to preserve these cup-marks."

When cultivated, the land, which is around 10.3% of the area used for food crops in the state, is expected to increase Goas agricultural production.Satisfied with the project, the bureau now plans to conduct a similar exercise in other parts of the country, including Maharashtra After the project got sanctioned in 2015, a special task force of the bureau constituted in Nagpur carried out an extensive study for one-and-a-half years using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the bureaus report Characterization and mapping of land resource of Goa submitted this year, the Goa government is planning to introduce contract and organic farming to boost the states farmers and overall agricultural produce.The identified fallow land area is part of the khajan land (lying between the sea and the hills). This is an area which time and again is affected by seawater and fresh water of Mandovi and Zuari rivers draining the state from hills to the coast. Khajan land is considered as the best potential area for rice cultivation but currently is not being used by the farmers to its full potential, said Surendra Kumar Singh , the director of NBSS&LUP.As per the mapping, most of the fallow land lie in Tiswadi, Bardez and Salcette talukas of the state.Singh added that the land is affected by extensive erosion taking place due to the two rivers. The productivity of these lands has also declined due to flow of sediments from mining, he said.During the release of the report on December 5, which was also the World Soil Day, Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar announced that introducing contract farming in fallow lands will increase the states agricultural production and double farmers income by 2022.For this, the bureau is also preparing a land use plan. For contract farming, the government will be calling corporate investors. The contractor, will raise the crops and also provide employment to landless farmers, added Singh.Now, the bureau envisages to investigate and map fallow lands in different parts of the country. There is a lot of potential in North-Eastern states, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and many other places. With good data and management plan, fallow lands could be used to expand land for agriculture purposes, said Singh.Recently, the bureau had prepared a geo-spatial digital map identifying areas holding high potential for organic farming in the country."

Filled with greens, proteins and healthy grains, and a delicious dressing, it appealed to the health-conscious eater. Today, her family of four has traded in the plate for the bowl, to ensure they get the nutrition they need while practising portion control. ""While most Buddha bowls are vegetarian or vegan, ours have some fish and meat occasionally,"" says Balachandran. ""They are tasty and we are left with fewer dirty dishes.""From acai to poke and Buddha bowls  single meal options, popular across the world, are catching on in Chennai too. ""The single meal concept has been there since time immemorial, especially with Asians,"" says Vikram Cotah , chief operating officer, GRT Hotels and Resorts.While acai bowls are thick smoothies topped with oatmeal, fruit or peanut butter, poke bowls are Hawaiian raw fish salads that expanded to incorporate quinoa and zucchini noodles. ""The Buddha bowl gets its name from stories of Buddha going door to door with a bowl asking for alms, and people used to put whatever food they had into it,"" says Cotah.Bazaar at Grand by GRT Hotels has had super bowls on the menu for the past two years. ""The millennials are obsessed with healthy eating, and older people are keen on following a healthy lifestyle, so these bowls offer high nutrition in small portions,"" says Cotah.Customers can choose vegetables, seafood or meat and their staple  quinoa, brown rice and soba noodles  as well as the sauce.

The Kudumbashree workers in Kollam, Ernakulam and Kannur , who were chosen for the governments diabetes prevention program, were studied.The number of Kudumbashree workers having diabetes is very high. The prevalence is seen more in women. This is mainly due to their diet. They eat more rice and avoid vegetables, said Dr K R Thankappan from Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, co-author of the study.Dr Thankappan said they have noticed a disturbing trend in Kerala where more number of poor people are getting diabetes because of less physical activity. The rich are conscious about their health and are making a conscious effort to bring in lifestyle changes, he said.Also, the study found that those who manage to keep diabetes under control are less. Despite available facilities, the controlled diabetes rate is 15.5%. Most people dont take medicines till they develop complications. Also, they claim that they dont have enough money to spend on medicines, said Dr Thankappan.Peoples attitude needs to change and they need to modify their lifestyle and diet, he added.With this data in hand, now government is planning to conduct a study on why people with diabetes are avoiding medicines.Experts believe that it is high time that the government invests in health clubs in all districts and schools.

The seized rice was meant for distribution at ration shops in the city.Police sources said Sethukali had diverted the PDS rice to her mill in connivance with sales persons at a few ration shops. Acting on a tip off, a team consisting of deputy superintendent of police Namachivayam and inspector Senthil Kumar conducted searches at the mill on Tuesday and seized 160 bags of rice.Inquiries revealed that Sethukali, who owns two trucks, had taken a contract to transport PDS rice from government godowns to various ration shops. With the help of ration shop salespersons, she diverted PDS rice to her mill. The officials recently received information that the trucks go to her rice mill from the government godown in VK Puram near Jaihindpuram.Police said that a few more people are expected to be arrested in the case. The salespersons often manipulate the records to show that the government welfare is issued to the beneficiaries. They also maintain to the public that there is short supply from the government.Sources said that the PDS rice distributed by the state government is of good quality and there is a huge demand for it in neighbouring states like Kerala. It is polished in the rice mills there and packed in 25kg bags and can fetch a minimum of Rs 50 per kg."
