But at the same time, the two nations share some significant history, right from the days of British Raj in India and Apartheid in South Africa. The common thread of the history shared by the two countries has been made into quite a classy promotional video. ""The Freedom Series is the Test series between South Africa and India. It honours both nations test of character to achieve freedom through nonviolence, and their mutual love of cricket. It also recognises the fact that India was the first country to welcome back South Africa after readmission to international cricket,"" says the caption of the video on YouTube, published by ProteasCricket.The series between India and South Africa has been named the Freedom Series to mark the two nations' freedom struggles and the common love for cricket.Mohammad Azharuddin and Clive Rice exchange greetings. Photo Credit: YoutubeIndia was the first team to tour South Africa in 1992, after South Africa was in-inducted into international cricket after the end of Apartheid era. That series was called the Friendship Series. Mohammad Azharuddin was India captain while South Africa were led by Clive Rice.India played four Tests and seven One-day Internationals. The hosts won the Test series 1-0 and were runaway 5-2 winners in the ODI series.However, the 'Friendship' part was severely tested during the 2nd ODI at Port Elizabeth when South African batsman Peter Kirsten refused to take heed of several warnings from bowler Kapil Dev about not taking a long start from the non-striker's crease.Eventually, Kapil ran Kirsten out while coming in to bowl, which led to a fair amount of bad blood between the two sides.The Indians even went on to state that Kepler Wessels, who was batting at that time, had hit Kapil Dev on his shin while taking a run. However, no action was taken as the video of the episode went missing."

Photo: PTIWhen South Africa marked their return to international cricket in 1991 with a series against India, there was one strange thing about the build-upor at least it felt strange at the time.If the West Indies were visiting, for example, you would have nightmares about Curtly Ambrose or Patrick Patterson. If it was England you were going up against, a fear of not being able to dismiss Graham Gooch would cause much stress. Zimbabwe? Please, please, please dont lose to Zimbabwe! This anxiety came with the territory if you grew up watching Indian cricket in the 1980s and 1990s.With the South Africans, however, you read the names on the visiting squad list without feeling either stress or fear, because you didnt really have anything to associate those names with.Allan Donald was right-arm fast but we didnt know how fast. All we knew about Kepler Wessels was that he was a left-handed opener... and we imagined yet another southpaw who would get his team off to solid starts. The only things of note to come out of scanning the list were the excruciating puns involving (Jimmy) Cook, (Clive) Rice and Wessels.Over time, with South Africa establishing themselves as one of the top teams in the world, curiosity was replaced by fear, especially when it came to away tours. Facing Donald was bad enough... facing Donald at Durban? There was no scenario in which this could end well.The good memories came in fits and spurtslike Mohammad Azharuddin and Sachin Tendulkars famous counter-attack at Cape Town in 1997. Azharuddin got 115 off just 110 balls before being run out, while Tendulkar scored 169 before falling to that ridiculous catch by Adam Bacher. India went on to lose by 282 runs, but what a glorious, glorious defeat.Also read: Indias tour of South Africa: Equal in skills, disadvantaged by historyWith Indian cricket growing stronger in the last decade and a half, contests against South Africa became more competitive, with this new-found aggression defined by that I-dont-care-whos-watching mid-pitch dance by S. Sreesanth in Johannesburg, 2006.Given this progression, its perhaps natural that the series which kicks off in Cape Town on Friday has been preceded mostly by optimism and excitement, even though the team is yet to win a series there.The Indian team is in top form going into this contest, coming as it does on the back of nine consecutive series wins. They have played most of their recent cricket in familiar conditions, agreed, but they also have all the tools to do well overseas.In Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara, they have batsmen who can see off the new balland that is if Shikhar Dhawan fails to provide explosive starts. In Virat Kohli, they have one of the best batsmen in the world, while both Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma can turn a match on its head in a session. The bowling line-up looks strong enough to dismiss any team twice over five days.We know exactly what we need to do come game time, Kohli told the press after landing in South Africa. We know how to win Test matches.If the build-up to that first series 17 years ago seemed strange, this time around feels equally unfamiliar...a confident Indian team talking up their chances of winning in South Africa.Anxiety has been replaced by excitement, and, if nothing else, its a nice feeling to start 2018 with.Deepak Narayanan, a journalist for nearly 20 years, now runs an events space, The 248 Collective, in Goa.He tweets at @deepakyen"

In the first phase, over 1,000 children studying in Bengaluru schools will get the millet meals as it is being launched in Bengaluru on a pilot basis.This is a joint initiative of the departments of agriculture and education in association with Non-Profit Organisation Akshaya Patra Foundation, which is already a partner of the education department in providing mid-day meals. As per the information available, State Agriculture Minister Krishna Byregowda will be launching the scheme on January 11, 2018 at one of the government schools in his constituency.Meanwhile, the health and growth of these 1,000 kids will be monitored for 6 to 8 months and based on the report, government will think of extending it to other schools and also across the state.Presently, the kids are getting white rice, wheat, pulses and vegetables. Now, according to information, millet rice is going to replace the white rice, and even the sweet which was provided on Wednesdays and Fridays, will be prepared using millets.This initiative is mainly to provide more nutritious food to school kids and also to help farmers as millets can be grown in dry land with less water. Recently, Akshaya Patra launched this initiative in Hyderabad and Tamil Nadu has already included millets in its mid-day meal project.The aim is to overcome nutritional issues of school children and bringing nutritious values of traditional millets into the modern food practice. According to a research, malnutrition is caused due to lack of protein supply and millets are high in protein, mentioned a senior official of the agriculture department.Even Niti Aayog has suggested to include millets in Public Distribution System (PDS) and mid-day meal scheme. However, the idea is to promote millets as nutri-cereals and Indian council for Agricultural Research is working on storage issues as storage of millets for a long time is an issue, explained official."

How?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/jan/10/city-hotel-runs-zero-waste-how-1750251.html,2018-01-11,"BENGALURU:Five years ago, when New Krishna Bhavan owner Gopinath Prabhu adopted zero-solid-waste management in his hotel, many wondered how long he could manage it with his limited number of employees and how he would meet the cost of it. Today, Gopinath can proudly say that he has reused/recycled more than 200 tonnes of waste.New Krishna Bhavan hotel located in Malleswaram is one of the oldest hotels in the city and a landmark for many. Many of the diners are not aware that the food they waste is not trashed. Hotel owner Gopinath ensures that every bit of 150-200kg of waste generated every day is re-used/recycled for other purposes including composting.His success lies in understanding the composition of his waste, and segregating it into three bins and a bag instead of the usually prescribed two bins and a bag. Wet waste such as vegetable and food waste goes into one bin, dry like coconut husk into another and coffee/tea powder into third, and plastic and paper are dropped into the gunny bag.The wet waste is sent to a piggery, coconut husk is used as fuel for stoves, coffee/tea powder is sprinkled over a nearby park as compost and plastic handed over to recyclers.Implementing zero-waste management was a challenge initially, particularly getting employees interested in the process. But now they are proud of their effort. This waste-management method has also corrected excess production, says Gopinath. Initially we maintained a register to audit the wastage. We found out that we were cooking more than needed, and so we cut back on production, which saved our money too, he says.We saw that we needed only 3 kg of rice but cooked 5 kg. Many times, ingredients like lemon and other vegetables used to lie unused and rot. With our waste audit, we cut back on unecessary spending, he adds. Gopinath started on this mission in 2013, after he was tired of irregular work by the BBMP contractor.He was not punctual and would come during peak business hours. The bad smell that collected waste let out put off customers. On top of it, they were asking for money to come regularly. One day I decided to put an end to it and do something on my own. My friend Ramakanth who is a waste-management expert guided me in designing this system, he says.In the beginning, Gopinath and his manager Rajan had to monitor the system, but now employees follow it without supervision.Bhavani, who washes vessels, says that placing the bins close to her work area also makes it easy for her.In other hotels, we collect the food waste till end of a shift and then another person sweeps it up and dumps it in a bin kept far away, she says."

This year, the MSP of common variety of paddy conforming to fair average quality (FAQ) is `1,550 per quintal, while Grade-A variety has been fixed at `1,590.This year, the district administration had targeted to procure 14 lakh quintals of paddy from the registered farmers through 46 mandis. Initially, 43 millers who have delivered their CMR by September were allowed to participate in the procurement process. They were asked to procure paddy in the ratio of 1:6 over their security deposits with the Civil Supply Department.Later, 47 millers, who had failed to deliver their CMR target by September, approached the department and sought more time. Following this, the Corporation allowed the millers to deliver their rice by December and participate in the procurement process. However, the millers were asked to procure paddy in the ratio of 1:1 ratio over their security deposits with the department. Later, the department also restricted 24 millers from participation in the procurement as they failed to deliver 10 per cent of CMR against their paddy.Meanwhile, irate farmers have threatened to intensify their agitation if the State Government fails to resolve the matter soon.District Civil Supply Officer BCH Dash said the issue would be resolved after arrival of the Managing Director of the corporation who is likely to visit the district to review paddy procurement soon."

Yadav, who was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail in the Deoghar treasury case on January 6, was earlier convicted and sentenced to five years in jail in the first Chaibasa treasury case (RC 20A/96) on September 30, 2013.Arguments by CBI in the RC 68A/96 case were completed today and the judge, SS Prasad, fixed January 24 as the date to pronounce the judgment, said Yadavs counsel Prabhat Kumar. If Yadav is convicted in this case, which legal experts said seems very likely, it will be his third conviction in the scam that surfaced in 1996 and kept impacting the course of Bihar politics since.Yadav, a former Bihar chief minister for two terms and also a former railway minister, has been lodged in Birsa Munda Central Jail near Ranchi since December 23, when he was convicted in the Deogahr treasury case. He appeared in the special CBI courts in connection with three different cases alongside the other accused on Wednesday and looked depressed.But the 69-year-old leaders renowned sense of humour was intact as he asked the judge in the Doranda treasury case, Pradeep Kumar, to allow him freedom to celebrate the upcoming Makar Sankranti festival in the middle of his family and supporters at his Patna residence.If I were free, I would enjoy the dahi-chuda (curd and flattened rice with sugar) dishes during Makar Sankranti, Sir, said Yadav. The judge retorted: We will arrange dahi-chuda for you here. How much do you want?When Yadav complained about only three visitors being allowed to see him in jail, the judge said he could not do anything about it as only the legislature has the power to frame rules. Yadav also said the court premises remain overcrowded and he was getting pushed and pulled. The judge replied, There have been proper arrangements for your security. It is your supporters who are thronging the court premises."

The proposal comes in the wake of the Telangana government having launched a pilot project to include the small-seeded grasses to school meals with the help of Akshaya Patra Foundation.Akshaya Patra serves midday meals in four districts of Andhra Pradesh, i.e. 370 government schools and anganwadi centres, touching 74,409 children every working day.The midday meal in most of the states schools is taken care of by self help groups. They serve over 7 lakh students dal, vegetables and rice every day and an egg thrice a week.Akshaya Patra supplies vegetable rice, khichdi and a banana or groundnut chikki instead of egg. Officials are now looking at the possibility of including millets in the diet. The intake of millets in coastal and northern Andhra is less when compared to Rayalaseema and Telangana. According to sources, the Education Department has proposed the setting up of a Nutrition Committee to identify the right millets and a roadmap to incorporate them in the regular meal.As the midday meal is mostly taken care of by self help groups, the state plans to supply cooked millet items directly to schools so that it can be served to students along with their meal.At schools where the meal is being served by Akshaya Patra, the government intends to tie up with the foundation as done in Telangana. School Education Department Commisioner K Sandhya Rani told TNIE officials have been chewing on the proposal for some time now. Adding millets to the regular meal will help us raise the nutrition levels of the food being served to children, she said."

I am a pucca Chennai paiyyan. I did my catering course in Cuddalore. After that I got a job in a five-star hotel in Dubai and I have spent most of my learning years in the Middle East.It was there that I learnt different cuisines. Though I can whip up decent Indian dishes, Indian cuisine was never my specialty in any kitchen I have worked in so far. I am crazy about new cuisines and presenting exotic dishes to guests. Thats where being in a different country helped.In eight years, I learned four different cuisines. First I was specialising in continental cuisine, then Mexican, Italian and then pan Asian cooking. Thats when I got fascinated with Japanese cuisine. After learning all about it, I came to Chennai; that was eight years ago.Authentic Japanese food is very raw and it doesnt suit the Indian palate. Im sure you know about sushi; its raw fish rolled into sticky rice. But do you know how it actually tastes? Like blood! Japanese like it raw and they like the taste of blood in all their dishes. Indians cannot take it. Hence, I experiment with Japanese in such a way that our people also take a liking to it. I have introduced a lot of vegetarian options too, because I want to clear the misconception that Japanese food is just seafood. I fry or steam most of the dishes and add variety of sauces to them. Sauces play a very important role in Japanese cuisine.When I first tasted Japanese cuisine, I first tasted wasabi sauce. It looks like an Indian sweet...so I had quite a bit and my face turned red (laughs). We play this trick with all our customers too. Another thing that fascinates me about Japanese cuisine is the Teppanyaki  live kitchen. Here we cook in front of the guests and show off our culinary skills. The first time I went for it I was nervous, but later on, it became fun and now I wait for the guests to ask for it. We do fumble and make mistakes while presenting, but guests are understanding.While in the Middle East I have travelled a lot and had a lot of street food. I like to observe what they do and then use it in my cooking too. In Chennai, I love to gorge on Burmese food. Now that I have tried all the main cuisines, I want to master French cuisine next. Our executive chef here knows all about it and I am already learning a lot from him. Apart from that, I want to bring in some rice and noodle variation in the Japanese menu here.To all those who want to get into this industry I would say start off in a star restaurant; it will take you to places. There were around 30 of us in the batch, but I am the only one who is still in the cooking industry because I leaped higher.IngredientsPrawns: 6 piecesOlive oil: 1 spoonSake: 15 mlMirin: 15 mlSoya: 10 mlA pinch of saltPepper: 2 pinchTogarashi: 15 gMethodPre-heat stove to medium lowWhen the pan is ready, add olive oil and cook the shrimp for 2 to 3 minutesMix all the ingredients which are mentioned above Garnish it with fresh lemon wedgesIngredientsLobster: 350 gOlive oil: 1 spoonSake: 10 mlPepper: 2 pinchOyster garlic sauce: 20 mlGarlic butter: 1 spoonMethodPre-heat the stoveto medium lowAdd the lobster and cook for 5-10 minutesAdd sake, pepper, oyster garlic sauce and garlic butterGarnish it with lime slices and scallions"

A few decades ago, places like Rajdoot, Abhiruchi and Indu Deluxe messes had made a name for themselves drawing in a large number of customers every day and providing them with flavourful and spicy Telugu food. Though some of these have closed down, they have inspired many others, and today there are large numbers of these messes all over the city operating as the lifeline for many.The business model of the Telugu messes is simple. They offer good quality meals prices as little at Rs 50 to Rs 120. Typically, a sit-down meal on a shared table will have dal, sambar, rasam, a few of vegetable items, curd and papad along with rice and the quantities are unlimited. A range of chutneys, pickles, and podis are available to enrich the taste, and you can also ask for some ghee to add to the dal. Those serving food inside the mess are quick on their feet, you get an immediate replenishment of any item you desire. While eating, do not be surprised if you find someone standing next to you breathing down your neck, waiting for you to vacate the place so that he can occupy the seat and have his lunch. The meals are usually vegetarian, in most places few non-vegetarian items mostly chicken and mutton, are available to be ordered on a-la-carte basis. Most of the messes follow a coupon system, where you have to prepay for your meals. It is a tough business which works on high volumes and thin margins, every year many places close down while new places try their luck.Each area in the city has its favourite mess bustling with activity, but there are some which have a reputation all across the city. Kakatiya Deluxe Mess at Ameerpet possibly has the largest number of fans. Operating from 1992, the mess serves really tasty food, and you can see a steady stream of customers trooping in for their meals. Though Kakatiya meals use a fair amount of chillies, I have never found the heat overwhelming the other spices in the taste. Each is traditional and delicious. The pickles and podis kept on the table are special attractions for any customer. According to Rakesh Uppalapati ofKakatiya Mess, the establishment works hard to source good ingredients so that they can provide a quality experience to countless students, workers and office-goers who rely on them for good food. They have also renovated the place to make it air-conditioned. A meal here costs Rs 120, while a nicely packed take-away meal is Rs 130. They always have some non-vegetarian a-la-carte dishes like Natu Kodi Curry, Mutton Fry or Prawns Fry as add-ons to the meal.Harsha Mess in Ameerpet, Indu Deluxe in Lakdi-Ka-Pool, Sairam Mess in Begumpet and Abhiruchi in Madhapur are some more popular Telugu messes where you can relish some really good local meals in Hyderabad.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

As the price for the day is announced disappointment is writ large on his face. At Rs80 per crate of 15kg, Tomato is threatening to bring tears in the eyes in this poll season for the farmers in this drought prone district.Good showers last monsoon had brought cheers for the farmers who had suffered consecutive years of drought. ""We can make some profit only if the price of tomato crosses Rs150 per crate and the price today will leave me incurring loss. With more farmers set to bring their produce to the market in the coming days I am really worried about the grim future. The price could fall below Rs50 per crate. It will be a disaster,"" adds Vishwanath Reddy, a tomato grower from Mangasandra village in Kolar.The familiar scene of farmers dumping their tomato produce on the roads as a mark of protest is likely to repeat, says Santosh, a tomato merchant who supplies tomatos from Kolar to not only places like Chennai, Kolkata, Rajasthan and other parts of the country, but even exports to Quatar and Pakistan. ""We are sending over 300 to 400 crates every day now to Quatar and Pakistan,"" claims Santosh.A perennially drought prone district, Kolar has carved a niche for itself in horticulture. The district is the main supplier of Mango and vegetables like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and beans.We have been let down by our leadersWhile the tomato tale of tears is a recurring feature, the farmers of Kolar curse the failure of their leaders for letting them down in redressing their problem. ""We had agriculture ministers like C Byre Gowda, Srinivasa Gowda and now Krishna Byre Gowda from our own district, but without finding a lasting solution for our woes whether in getting water for our crops or ensuring a fair price and market for our produce,"" says Chandrappa who has branched out to sericulture apart from his tomato farming.Known as the district of 'Silk and Milk' for its strides in sericulture and dairy farming, the people are waking up for the electoral heat with their demands.""Setting up cold storage chains to store farm produce during the time of price crash, setting up agro-processing industries, speeding up projects like Yettinahole and Yarragolu ti bring water, giving push for industrial growth in the region,' tops our wish, says Chandrappa of Mudavadi village.The villages are already seeing the divide as the May 12 assembly election is approaching. In Mangasandra with a population of about 1000, the divide is clear between Above Poverty Line(APL) and Below Poverty Line(BPL) families and also caste divide between Vokkaliga, Kuruba,SC/ST and Minority communities. The Kolar constituency is witnessing tough fight between former agriculture minister Srinivasa Gowda of JD(S) and Syed Zameer Pasha of Congress. The Kuruba, SC/ST and Minority population is showing greater preference for Congress while the Vokkaliga and Reddy communities along with a few OBC castes are consolidating behind Srinivasa Gowda. While Om Shakti Chalapathy of BJP too is giving a fight, incumbent MLA Varthur Prakash of Namma Congress is determined to have the last laugh against his opponents from three bigger parties.While the BPL families are generally appreciative of Siddaramaiah government's welfare programmes, the APL families are miffed as they are not getting 30kg rice at concessional price of Rs10.Farming sustains the livelihood of about 60% of the population of the villagers, sericulture and dairy farming are drawing a large segment with hope of more steady income.Rain hits sweet dreams of Mango growersThe recent spell of rains and gale wings has hit the mango growers of Kolar and Srinivasapura. ""We had suffered due to a spell of untimely rains during the flowering season of mango. Just a couple of weeks back the fresh spell of rain and gusty winds has hit the crop,"" rues Chandrappa, a mango farmer in Srinivasapura.""Our yield is likely to go down by 30%. Now we are keeping our fingers crossed about the price we get,"" Chandrappa adds.Srinivasapura, the mango hub of the region is equally well known for its fierce political battle between Health Minister Ramesh Kumar and his arch rival Venkatashiva Reddy. The constituency has never seen its MLA score a repeat victory. It is always alternative terms for Ramesh Kumar and Venkatashiva Reddy here. Will Ramesh Kumar break the sequenced and humble Reddy again is the question that is being hotly debated in the constituency."

Over 1 lakh farmers, including about 6,000 sharecroppers, have so far been registered with Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) to sell their paddy in Government identified market yards (mandis).The number of registered farmers is likely to reach 1.5 lakh, Yadav said.So far, 419 PACS have registered with Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation (OSCSC), the Government agency for paddy procurement.Earlier, the State Government had set a target to procure total 53 lakh tonne of paddy (44 lakh tonne in Kharif and 9 lakh tonne in Rabi season) during the 2017 Kharif marketing season.The State Government has so far procured 38 lakh tonnes of Kharif paddy from 6.82 lakh farmers at an estimated cost of Rs 5,853 crore. Payment to the tune of Rs 5,826 crore has been made to the farmers.The balance payment could not be sent to the accounts of the farmers due to certain issues in their accounts, he said.The Government has introduced paddy procurement automation system (P-PAS), an electronic platform through which money is being directly transferred to the accounts of farmers immediately after procurement of paddy and this has been extended to 308 blocks.Yadav told the meeting that recovery of rice from the custom millers is very encouraging. Rice millers have so far delivered 70 per cent rice for the paddy they have taken for milling.Rice delivery from millers of Nuapada, Sambalpur, Subarnapur, Bargarh, Jagatsinghpur and Kalahandi is more than 80 per cent, he added.Govt's TargetOver 1 lakh farmers, including about 6,000 sharecroppers, registered with PACSNumber of registered farmers likely to reach 1.5 lakh419 PACS have registered with Odisha State Civil Supplies CorporationGovt had set a target to procure total 53 lakh tonne of paddy for both seasons38 lakh tonnes of Kharif paddy from 6.82 lakh farmers procuredRs 5,826 crore payment made to the farmersP-PAS extended to 308 blocksRice millers have delivered 70 pc rice for the paddy procured"

Therefore, I moved to Sydney under contract and then spent most of my career travelling the world and working for high-end fashion labels. It was along the way I discovered love for food culture which I had never known. Exposure to so many different and exciting cuisines sparked my imagination and I began to feel heady with possibility.I love travelling and my workshops and masterclasses across India give me the opportunity to marry my passion for food and love for travel.I experiment with the ingredient quinoa all the time and I love it. Ive experimented with salads, Indian dishes, even breakfast dishes. Its extremely versatile. Quinoa is an Andean plant which originated in the area surrounding Lake Titicaca in Peru and Bolivia. Unlike actual grains which grow in grasses, quinoa plants grow edible seeds.Quinoa is a flowering plant from the amaranth family. It is a great wheat-free alternative to starchy grains. It is commonly known as an ancient grain, however, it is neither a grain nor cereal grain, but a seed, and does not contain gluten. Also, my favourite fact is that its high in protein which is perfect for vegetarians to get in that protein hit. After it is cooked and cooled down, this is great source of protein, carbohydrates and fibre to satisfy you for hours.The taste and texture of quinoa is a bit like brown rice crossed with oatmeal. Its fluffy, creamy, crunchy and somewhat nutty, all rolled into one. Its versatile and can be prepared several ways. The main factor is to make sure you rinse the seed thoroughly to remove the outer bitterness and to make sure you dont overcook it as it can become very mushy. It should still have a tiny bite to it but fluffy at the same time.On my menu at Antares in Goa, Ive added a quinoa salad with a grilled salmon with a beurre blanc sauce and on my menu at The Wine Rack in Mumbai, Ive added a quinoa edamame biryani with avocado raita.

The villages would be required to submit a joint certificate given by the MLA and the Commune Commissioner to the Civil Supplies Commissioner to avail of the scheme,"" a report in DNA quoted her as saying.The local authorities have been given a four-week deadline to clean up and avail the certificate.Linked Free Rice distribution to respective constituency MLAs & Commune Commisioners Certifying villages open defecation free and of strewn garbage and plastic.Free Rice reaches out to more than half d population primarily in rural areasThis is d learning of morning round today pic.twitter.com/CCIaVAGdDT  Kiran Bedi (@thekiranbedi) April 28, 2018I am very anguished at the slow pace of rural sanitation. Last two years I have not seen local representatives and concerned public officials determined to make rural Puducherry clean within a time frame. I am sorry this cannot go on, according to DNA.Following Bedi's controversial remarks, AIADMK Legislature Party leader A Anbazhagan said that the remark made by her was unacceptable.Talking to newspersons, Anbazhagan said these remarks amount to casting disgrace on the poor who are getting free rice and is a sort of threatening the rural people, which is not fit for the post of Lt.Governor.It is the responsibility of the PWD, Local Administration Department and commune panchayat officials that the rural areas were kept clean.Action should be initiated against the department officials if the rural areas were not clean, he said.The AIADMK leader said cleaning garbage is the responsibility of the government and added that a private agency was engaged at a cost of Rs 22 crore to clean garbage in the town.Officials should monitor whether they are doing their duty properly and if not should cancel the contract.Instead of this, punishing the poor in the free rice scheme shows the 'authoritarian' attitude of the Lt.Governor, he said, adding that this is not a civilized act.He wondered what would be the reaction of Chief Minister V Narayanasamy on the issue.Describing the state plan board meeting on Friday Chaired by Ms Bedi as an 'eye wash', Mr Anbazhagan said the meeting should have been held in January to finalize the size of the annual budget.He said legislature party leaders of different parties were invited for the meeting last year which was not done this year which create suspicion whether the government is functioning in a democratic way.Alleging that corruption is rampant with the registration department here and Rs.25000 to Rs.30,000 is being collected as a bribe to register a land document, Mr Anbazhagan urged the Lt.Governor to order for a probe.Theft and burglary are on increase here, he said people are afraid to go to some other places during summer vacation.(With inputs from UNI)"

Vegetables, fruits and flowers find a place among farmers, where paddy and sugarcane ruled the roost earlier. In the past two years, horticulture cultivation increased by 16.7 per cent.Due to the erratic monsoon and lack of water in several localities, farmers in the region are switching over to horticulture. Paddy, which requires abundant water, is fading out with vegetables and fruits leading the pack, said horticultural department officials.It was found in a study by the horticultural department that horticultural crops account for at least 45 per cent in the region and vegetable cultivation witnessed a 2 per cent rise in the past two years. According to the data, cashew cultivation accounts for 30 per cent, while vegetables and fruits have cornered 15 per cent.Speaking to Express, a senior horticulture department official said, Horticulture is leading in several parts of the district, including delta region, which are facing water scarcity due to the erratic monsoon. For the first time, Thanjavur, the rice bowl of the state, has also seen farmers laying their hands on vegetables and fruits.As paddy and sugarcane cultivation is not fetching good return, there are many takers for horticulture, the official added. N Kannan, a farmer from Kaganankuppam, is betting big on ladys finger cultivation followed by guava and brinjal. The soil is conducive and less water is needed for their farming. Despite being a coastal town, the Cuddalore region is known for its fertile soil. There are also many takers for cultivating flowers and many have tried their hands on marigold cultivation.From 2013 to 2018, the entire acreage has been reduced to 8,13,000 hectares, according to officials. For the past 10 years, horticulture in state improved by 2.63 lakh hectare to 4.78 lakh hectares, according to data."

Born and raised in Kumbakonam, catering has been her family business for many years. Sambar and rasam run in my genes. Cooking is like yoga, it gives me peace of mind, says Prema mami, as she is fondly called. It is this dedicated hobby and love for food that has turned into a full-time profession. And Prema mami has a specific mission too. People should know that there is lot to offer in vegetarian Tamil cuisine, too,she says.Premas husband is also a chef. He used to work as a senior chef at a five-star hotel in Dubai. My husbands way of thinking is different from mine. I focus more on the homemade traditional recipes but I also like cooking North Indian and Chinese items, says Prema. Her daughters too draw inspiration from their mothers cooking, and continue to experiment interesting varieties on a daily basis, with her inputs.Prema cooked her first dish, the humble onion uthappam, when she was 10. For the last four years, Prema has been catering food in the US, and in Muscat for three years. Recollecting these experiences, Prema shares, Cooking for international crowd was special. They love homemade food. So they crave for anything fresh and not preheated. I make sure there is a balance in spices, oil and ghee so that you feel light after the meal.Prema is in the city presently, for the annual Mylai Mami Samayal Food Festival, for the fourth time. The spread of 26 varieties starts with panagam (a summer health drink) and has a blend of variety rice, kuzhambu (curries), poriyal (vegetables), sweets like godhumai halwa (wheat), and wraps up with neer mor (buttermilk). We come during vacations to ensure that kids get a taste of these forgotten Tamil vegetarian recipes. Its not often that we make kodamilagai thayir pachadi (capsicum and curd salad) or kathirikai (brinjal) podi curry.

The rice flour parcels as thin as Kleenex hiding roundels of poornam, would disappear within minutes of coming out of our pooja room once the obligatory offering to God was made. Of course everything else she made was superlative too. Even humble upma became a treat, and we would all clamour for the crispy layers or rava that would cling to the curves of the kadai once she was done.My children are regularly treated to steel dabbas of laddoo, murukku, barfi and mysore pak by their grandmothers, and each woman has a special sweet she is known for. I have childhood memories of bowls of steaming hot, sticky kesari appearing magically post dinner, when the mood took my mother. My sister bakes bread, cookies and regularly tosses out pancakes stuffed with deliciousness before she heads out to work.Me? I have our cook K Aunty on speed dial and some mean food delivery joints on my phone saved under ICE.To feed our children is an innate instinct. From the first time you lift your newborn to nurse them or offer a bottle to quell their wails of hunger, we are programmed to want to put food in our childrens mouths. As they get older we puree and mash, coax and cajole, scream and bribe and even beg them to try new foods. And between the oats, sambar rice, dal and roti are the magical items of food we make to show the softer side of our love.I unfortunately have neither the ability nor the inclination to express this soft love through food. I wasn't always like this. I used to be interested in cooking. I even scoffed when my husband offered to find a cook when we were newly weds. After some incidents with toor dal and recalcitrant pressure cookers, I gave in. In an attempt to develop these skills I have procured an entire shelf of cook books over the years and have even ventured in to the terrifying domain of food Instagram (tip: shoot from an angle and in black and white and no one will notice the burnt bits. Even better, buy a loaf of bread, removing packaging and post as your own creation #whocantell?)Theres a part of me that wants to be that parent. Its the same part that wants to be able to cut along a straight line, Mary Kondo my sock drawer and scrapbook. But, I will always be the person with mismatched socks, poor cutting skills and a mountain of random pictures sitting on a cloud somewhere.I and my children (and perhaps one day, grandchildren) will have to make peace with the fact that I will never be known for a particular delicacy. That no one will be welcomed home to the smells of gulab jamuns frying or cookies baking. Burning perhaps. But not baking.A few years ago my mother tried to persuade me to learn how to make Indian sweets and savouries. I recoiled from the idea. I think that by agreeing to learn, I would be acknowledging that I was no longer the child who would be pampered. I would have to become the purveyor of sweets. Thanks, but no thanks. Are there any kozhakattais left over?"

In the newly launched eatery you will be welcomed by the idols of Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar and ayyanar (a god worshipped in Tamil Nadu) terracotta horse, which also happens to be their logo.The pure vegetarian restaurant is run by city-based couple PK Senthil Kumar and Devi Umapathi, who have completed their Masters in Business Management. They also run an organic store, G Organics, inside the same compound from where they source groceries for the restaurant. Initially we planned for a cafe. Ive been negotiating with the owner for the past one year because of the organic and green environment, says Senthil who spends most of his time travelling to farms around the country. He picks up goods from a particular place only after visiting them. Ive visited over 300-400 farms and you can figure that from the distance Ive covered in my car. Having a look at the farm will give an idea about the methods of farming practices and organic growth of the plants, he explains. The couple have studied about organic farming practices for about two years.Their aim is to introduce the younger generation to age-old village delicacies. Both of us believe that certain food items and lifestyle suit only a particular category of DNA. Nature is designed in such a way that seasonal fruits and vegetables adapt themselves to it and the yield is more only during that time. For instance, mangoes are available only during summer, he adds.Going the organic wayAs we take our seat and munch on hot and crispy vazahaipoo vadai, Senthil tells us they share the recipes with their customers. Not many are willing to explore new organic products. So we thought of using such ingredients directly in the food. Now they are surprised about the variety we offer and the way it can be used in preparing a dish, says Senthil.To spread awareness, they also plan to organise cooking workshops. Through brainstorming sessions we have arrived at a menu based on what our grandmothers used to make in our native village Varusanadu near Theni. Instead of asking customers for feedback we are asking them to share traditional recipes, so that we can try it out in our kitchens and add it to the menu, he says.The menu will be seasonal. Nongu, kambu koozh, and elaneer will be added in the summer menu. We tried payasam using karuppu kavuni arisi and sukku karupatti halwa. Karuppu kavuni is 60 years old and only a few activists have preserved it. Millets have nutritional values but this rice is known for its medicinal properties, he says adding most of the rice varieties are sourced from Thanjavur and Kumbakonam. Surprisingly, Senthil had a tough time finding chefs who specialise in south Indian cuisine.Best out of wasteCook Gramam is two-storeyed. In a bid to go organic, and be nature-friendly, there are varieties of trees like chikkoo, mango, and guava planted around the 100-seater place. The chairs are made of bamboo and there are bamboo mats with layers of vetiver (fragrant grasses) as the fragrance from it is believed to calm you down. Alongside there are plants like pepper mint, and lemon grass picked up from Auroville. Weve designed the interiors using scraps, keeping it as economical as possible, he shares. Many village features are replicated into the ambiance.On a small thinnai (sit-out) outside, Senthil plans to set up traditional games like pallankuzhi, pambaram, and dhayam for entertainment. Beside that there is a push cart to serve snacks like hot bondas and bajjis in the evening. Right next to it is a small kitchen. Among the highlights of the dcor is the staircase. You can find cycle wheels, milk can, old machine parts, broken model windows, and metal scraps on it. Their take away items will be packed in boxes made of corn starch, sugarcane waste, and paper straws. There will be more outlets in Chennai soon."

This was one of the main concerns raised by civic activists at the public workshop on the proposed expansion of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) held at the Ripon Buildings on Monday.Civic activists alleged that the panel headed by Rajesh Lakhoni, member secretary of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), was not able to convincingly justify the proposal to expand the CMA from 1,189 sq km to 8,878 sq km, which will make it the largest metropolitan area in the country.Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts, along with Arakkonam taluk of Vellore district, are to become a part of the expanded area. Questions from the public on the rationale behind including agricultural districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur in the CMA received vague answers such as better usage of land. The officials said the expansion was not about urbanisation, but about better land use. However, plans on how to use the land better were not laid out during the discussion, Kanchan Asrani, a member of the Arappor Iyakkam, told Express.Jayaram Vekatesan, convener of Arappor Iyakkam, asked whether the CMDA was under pressure to push the expansion.

Is it smart to turn it into a metropolitan area? he said, hinting that expansion was a move to appease real estate honchos.What was it?R Prashanth Goutham, a resident of Kotturpuram, who was also present at the workshop questioned what the meeting set out to achieve. It was first called a workshop and then during the meeting it was referred to as a consultative session, based on which a decision would be taken, he said, calling for clarity in the purpose of meetings in the coming days."

Caste equations have come to the fore and a few in the Congress circle believe that his entry would consolidate Kuruba votes, other than the Ahinda votes, in favour of the party candidates in about 25 to 35 constituencies.Irrigation Minister M B Patil says that the chief ministers decision will give an edge to Congress candidates locked in a keen contest in various constituencies, and who may have otherwise lost by a narrow margin.His candidature has already shaken things up in many constituencies in Bijapura, Bagalkot and Belagavi districts, where Congress members had turned complacent after party president Rahul Gandhis visit.Local party people claim that there was a possibility of infighting otherwise -- with differences within the party rank and file, between supporters of sitting MLA B B Chimmankatti and those of Congress ticket aspirant Devaraj Patil.While in public many maintain that Siddaramaiahs Badami ticket will help the partys prospects, privately many express an anger for having to sacrifice the constituency to him.'CM should not quit once elected'Sources say that infighting will come to the fore during campaigning, in the absence of Siddaramaiah in Badami. The worst would be if Siddaramaiah resigns, giving way for by polls.Congress worker Harisha wants Siddaramaiah to promise that he will not resign if he wins from both Chamundeshwari in Mysuru and Badami. Otherwise it would be a huge let-down to party workers who have sweated to ensure his empathetic victory, he says.We are happy that Siddaramaiah is coming to Badami. We hope that he will bring development here and address many core issues in north Karnataka region, says voter Asham Peer.While, roadside vendor Tulsiavva says that he has her vote for giving rice at subsidised rates under `Anna Baghya'. I would have considered other candidates, if he had not been around, she says.Caste comes to centre stage: The JD(S) has found their candidate in Hanumanth Mavina Marad, from a dominant Panchamashali community. He has started consolidating his community members and is playing up Congress divisive politics in the Veerashaiva - Lingayat issue.The BJP that is yet to announce its candidates has floated names of industrialist Vijay Sankeshwara and MP Sriramulu among others, so that they can gather Nayaka and a lions share of Veerashaiva voters.The Congress leaders are not worried about Veershaiva votes getting divided, saying that he will win with Kuruba, SC and Muslim votes. Caste calculations are very much on BJPs mind too, with the party playing its card close to its chest.Meanwhile, sources in BJP and JD(S) say that they want to pin Siddaramaiah in Chamundeeshwari and Badami, without leaving him time to campaign across the state.Will he be accessible?: Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has to overcome the anti-incumbency wave, with the sitting MLA Chimmanakatti being blamed for underdevelopment, badly managed drought and snail pace of civic work. There is also his outsider tag, unlike in Chamundeswari.Voters also believe that it would be difficult to reach out to Siddaramaiah sitting in Bengaluru or Sriramulu in Bellary, says Vadvath H Kulkarni. He says that many working with rival parties may rethink and support Siddaramaiah, if he assures them that he would be accessible.Ramu Gowda, along with fellow villagers, are worried that without a local leader, their problems will remain unattended.We need to learn more about this, and let him know about lack of water for irrigation in drought-hit areas as majority of borewells have dried up in villages. However, we are hopeful that his entry may change the fortunes of people, says Arun Reddy."

""I just feel if my personality is in the way of what I think our club needs, for me that is more important than me.""- Atletico await -Wenger can still sign off leaving the club in the Champions League by winning the Europa League, where Arsenal host Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their semi-final on Thursday.He named a strong side against West Ham with only Petr Cech, Jack Wilshere and Mesut Ozil missing from the expected XI to face Atletico in midweek.However, amidst a surprisingly low-key atmosphere in the circumstances, the visitors' greater need for the points shone through with a bright start.Marko Arnautovic was denied from a narrow-angle by David Ospina before Cheikhou Kouyate's looping header came back off the top of the crossbar.However, Arsenal appeared a different side after the break to the one that laboured in the first half and Monreal put them ahead on 51 minutes by guiding Granit Xhaka's corner into the bottom corner to punish some awful West Ham marking.West Ham manager David Moyes reacted by sending on Manuel Lanzini and Javier Hernandez from the bench and was rewarded almost instantly as the former's cute through ball was smashed home by Arnautovic.Joe Hart did his chances of making England's World Cup squad no harm with stunning saves from Xhaka and Danny Welbeck.However, he was caught flat-footed when Declan Rice ducked out the way of Aaron Ramsey's cross eight minutes from time and the ball floated into the far corner.""Up until 82 minutes we were looking well worthy of a point,"" said Moyes.""The young player makes a really poor mistake on the second goal. I hope he learns from it because he's got big potential, but I think it really flattened the team.""And Arsenal piled on more mistery for the Hammers as Lacazette twice fired home from close range in the final five minutes.Defeat leaves West Ham still seven points above the relegation zone, but their chances of survival were boosted as Stoke failed to beat Burnley in a 1-1 draw to remain four points off safety.Badou Ndiaye had given the hosts the lead in the Potteries, but Ashley Barnes's leveller just after the hour mark means Paul Lambert's men need to win at least two of their remaining three fixtures to have any chance of beating the drop."
5aea89129855b73f522c0565,Why Fighting Hunger Is India's Greatest Challenge,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/fighting-hunger-is-india-s-greatest-challenge/story-1UBa5bIKbS094GpXnKQIAI.html,2018-04-21,"The stories from Indias hinterland on hunger are woeful in themselves. Earlier this year, a 13-year-old girl from Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh hanged herself after starving for more than two days  her father had passed away and her mother had found no work as a labourer. In the same week, a tribal youth in Kerala was beaten to death for stealing a kilo of rice from a grocery store. He had earlier resorted to begging and then to stealing; when caught, he was severely beaten and later succumbed to his injuries.More than 14.5% of our population is considered as undernourished, says the Global Hunger Index, 2017, with 21% children suffering from acute malnutrition, while 38.4% of children under the age of five suffer from stunting. This is reflected in the height of our children (children born in India are on average shorter than those in sub-Saharan Africa). More than 250 million Indians remain food insecure, ingesting less than 2,100 calories every day. As the Planning Commission put it in the Human Development Report, 2012: If India is not in a state of famine, it is quite clearly in a state of chronic hunger.Its not that policymakers dont recognise this. Along with the Right to Food Bill, the landmark PUCL vs Union of India case (2001) has seen more than 60 orders over the last decade  but this judicial activism has failed to translate into execution on the ground. This is owing to three key systemic factors. First, there is little institutional will to execute reforms that lead to better food delivery nationally, despite extensive legislation. Second, our food policy has focused on making cereals widely available even as the Food Corporation of Indias warehouses continue to leak away our agricultural surplus. Finally, the low social status of women has kept them ill-nourished. This, combined with open defecation has taken its toll on women and on children.This complex issue is not unsolvable  a variety of countries and states offer a template. South Africa, like India, has sought to explicitly guarantee a right to food, while Brazil has utilised its Fome Zero programme to provide three square meals to its people. This is backed by an institutional commitment, which has led to the consolidation of more than 31 food welfare programmes. Brazil has also allowed public prosecutors to take up the issue of hunger as a violation of human rights at the local level. Meanwhile, Uganda has sought to confer a legal responsibility for food security on the head of the household with penalties for malnutrition. It has combined this with urban centres which offer food for subsidised prices, and supplementary nutrition schemes have helped reduce hunger.States such as Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan have changed grain entitlements, while others such as Himachal Pradesh have sought to achieve universalisation of the PDS scheme. Chhattisgarh, in particular, has focused on better service monitoring while better commissions for fair price shop owners and price reductions have also helped increase PDS offtake while lowering incentives to cheat. India continues to store more than three million tonnes of grain in the open, exposed to rain and pests, with plastic sheets offering minimal protection. This is enough to feed a mid-sized European country.The challenge is one of getting more grains to the poor, while eliminating wastage and corruption along the way. Meanwhile, the leakages of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) can run up to 90% due to a range of factors, including poor quality wagons and inadequate security. Its stocking operations must be outsourced to the private sector, along with the adoption of a proactive liquidation policy. Breaking up FCI into its constituent parts should be evaluated, potentially decentralising procurement and encouraging local storage. With rising food inflation, its procurement policy should be increasingly skewed towards crops under the minimum support price policy, including pulses and oilseeds, even onions, and focused on food insecure states such as Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.There is a need to pursue a zero hunger programme with no stunted children below the age of two. This should be a multipronged strategy that focuses on improving agricultural productivity, empowers women through support for maternal and child care practices, and offers nutritional education and social protection programmes. Even as we offer such programmes for Vitamin A and iron, there are still significant gaps in implementation. Maharashtra has adopted a multi-disciplinary initiative, reducing child stunting by 15% between 2009 and 2014. The states nutrition mission has sought to develop better protocols for treating the acutely malnourished while ensuring better coordination between the nutrition and healthcare departments. India should adopt this mindset , battling against hunger over the next decade through long-term political commitment, along with policies encouraging food coupons, cash and in-kind transfers. Without such changes in execution, India will continue to remain hungry.Varun Gandhi is BJP national general secretary and a Lok Sabha MPThe views expressed are personal"

My dinner began with platefuls of mouth-watering starters. I relished Dimer Devil, Chingri Sesame Fry, Enchorer Chop, Veg Chop and Bhetki Fish Chop.What made the taste even more delightful was the combination of chutneys and sauces especially the pungent kasundi sauce which if not made according to the authentic recipe can turn disastrous ruining even the taste of the fries or chops. The star of the segment is Peas Kebab with the vegetable quite taking in to the flavour of the select spices. Another chutney that I enjoyed the most was Amer Chutney: the glassy slightly green preparation with cumin seeds giving its typical sweet and sour flavour.In the bhaja platter, Jhuri Aloo Bhaja and Karela Bhaja were crispy enough to get crunched under your teeth. The secret? Shares Swarnali, The trick is not to add salt in the beginning as it makes the preparation soggy. And this is not just one of the secrets that they have brought to the hotel. We have tried to include comfort food items also in the menu, adds Sarbani. Thats how in the main menu you have Sona Moonger Daal and steamed rice which I relished up with Kosha Mangsho and Potol-er-Dalma. Another dish which is a must-try is Shahi Rui Machh prepared with cashew-nut paste, posto (poppy seeds) and curd. Its balanced flavour went really well with the rice and daal combination.Shukto and Chicken Chaap increased the taste of fluffy golden-fried luchis. The mutton biryani was good but could have tasted better if more ghee was added to it. Another must-try is Mutton Rezala, the Mughlai dish in thin white gravy cooked with ground poppy seeds and select condiments oozing the fragrance of meetha attar and kewra.For capping the delightful spread I recommend Kheer Komola: juicy chunks of oranges cooked in thickened milk. The taste lingers in your taste buds long after you finish your meal.Relish the spread at both lunch and dinner on April 21 and April 22 at `1,199+ taxessaima@newindianexpress @Sfreen"

Varieties of millets were among the preferred cultivated crop for our farmers, till the green revolution brought advances in the cultivation of rice and wheat leading to better yield. Food habits of people also changed from millets to polished rice and refined wheat-based cereals. With the recent trends of health consciousness, there is a change to this, many consumers are back on the millet bandwagon and the governments of various states have been promoting this range of super food too.Gluten-free millets have many benefits over other staples. They are rich in proteins, vitamins, fibre and minerals making them ideal healthy food. Regular consumption of millets even has a beneficial influence on lifestyle diseases such as heart trouble, diabetes, and cholesterol. The food habits of the Telugu states have traditionally relied on many popular millet based dishes, ragi sangati and jonna roti being a few examples. And conscious consumers are increasingly looking for dishes made from millets like jowar, bajra, ragi, and korra.The comeback of millets is also due to social entrepreneurs who have actively promoted products based on millets. In the city, quite a few food and beverages organisations have taken a lead regarding this. Ahobilam Food Millet Caves is one such place that serves a range of millet-based dishes in its restaurant at Hi-Tec City. Started as a small store four years ago, the encouraging responses they received resulted in expansion into the eatery which serves dishes like ragi dosa and ragi idli for breakfast, as well as a very popular Millet Thali (`120) for lunch and dinner.The thali has dishes such as flavoured foxtail millet Rice, multi-millet rotis, ragi and jowar sangati as well as a dessert such as semiya or payasam made from ragi. The healthy items are quite delicious, for example, the multi-millet roti tastes much better than the usual wheat rotis. According to Vatsav Varma, one of the owners, the demand the dishes have encouraged them to continuously innovate and introduce new items based on all eight varieties of millets. As a step in this direction, they have recently started a bakery selling millet based burgers, biscuits and packed sweets such as millet laddu. They have also taken upon themselves on educating the consumers regarding benefits of the super food. Their restaurant has informational boards which speak about varieties of millet crops.Inner Being Wellness is another organisation which has come up with millet based products. Their products include ready to eat jowar based popcorns and bhujia, as well as ragi and bajra cookies. They also have idli and upma rawa based on jowar, which can be used to prepare these delicious snacks at home. People can easily plan to shift to these healthy alternatives.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

Reason: The state government is still to acknowledge the constitutional importance of the body that was constituted following directives of the Supreme Court, said commission members at a press conference in Lucknow on Friday.Speaking to HT, president UP food commission Nand Kishore Yadav said, Our decisions are not making any impact as the state government does not understanding the constitutional importance of the commission. Why will people come and appeal to the commission when its decisions are not implemented by the government?Another member DC Mishra said, The sate government is distributing wheat at Rs 2 / kg and rice at Rs 3 / kg, but there have been reports of food items reaching the black market. There have been at least seven big cases of food items being diverted in the state capital. Following complaints, the commission recommended an inquiry by the enforcement directorate within a time period of three to six months. The commission also recommended suspension of licences of around 90 rations shops in the state, but nothing has been done.Commission member Saroj Prasad, also wife of head of SC/ST commission Brij Lal, told HT,  The commission has recommended action against big ration mafias such as Sarvesh Pandey and Sonu, who are running over 80 fair price shops under different names. But the department has failed to act against them. There are godown in-charges who are controlling godowns for 20 years. These people need to be transferred. The commission has become a toothless body due to the state governments neglect.Commission members also voiced their frustration for not being given adequate staff to work with at their Lucknow Haat office in Vibhuti Khand.  We dont have any clerical staff , no class IV worker. So, we have to do all the clerical work ourselves, said member M Ismail Khan.The commission members demanded action from the government on the issues they were facing."

(File)In an attempt to curb pollution due to crop burning, Kriya Labs, a start up of IIT-Delhi, has developed a processing technology to convert agro-waste like rice straw into pulp  which can then be used to make several biodegradable products like cups, plates and other tableware.The project, along with other research and innovation projects, will be on display at the institutes Open Day, to be held on April 21.Unlike existing pulp-making process, which requires heavy machinery and economy of a large scale, our process can be economically integrated and sustainably run even in smaller scales. Additionally, the solvent system developed for the process is also completely biodegradable, non-volatile, made of natural products and completely safe to use, states a note on Kriya Labs website.Neetu Singh, a faculty member from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, whos working on the project, said this would also be profitable for farmers. The pulp that we make from the waste can be sold for Rs 45 per kg, even by the most conservative estimate. So it would actually be profitable for the farmers, instead of burning the straw. A one tonne processing unit will cost around Rs 35 lakh, she said.We thought of directly selling the products, but we later felt that it would not have a considerable impact. So were hoping to sell the technology to governments and companies, which can then be used to make it more widespread, said Singh.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

Considered the biggest open-air eatery in the world where devotees jostle for Mahaprasad every day, the place, however, appeared lifeless on the day.The stalls that sell Mahaprasad and dry prasad were found covered with polythene sheets, while some priests could be seen persuading devotees for dakhina citing that donations on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya can bring them good fortune.Baisi Pahacha, the 22 steps which connect the Lions Gate of the temple to the main premises, was however crowded for sometime as devotees struggled to get khichidi that was being served by a group of servitors.For the last three days, Mahaprasad has not been prepared after a rift between Suar Mahasuar Nijog and the temple administration over unsold Abadha after delay in rituals of the Trinity - Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra on April 16.The body of cooks, which has the sole right of preparing Mahaprasad in the 12th century shrine, demanded a `50 lakh compensation as the unsold Abadha had to be buried as per the tradition.This is perhaps for the first time that devotees were denied Abadha on Akshaya Tritiya which is believed to be one of the most auspicious days in the Hindu calendar. The day also marks beginning of agriculture season and construction of chariots for Rath Yatra.I visit Jagannath temple at least once a month but never experienced such a situation. Whenever I visit the temple, I take plenty of Mahaprasad packed for my family members back home. For the first time, I am returning empty-handed. No one is above the Lord and the law. Whoever is responsible must be dealt with iron hands, said Bhubanananda Sahu, a resident of Patia in Bhubaneswar.Devotees from as far as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, who had come to witness the rituals, were left disheartened too.This is my first visit to Puri and I feel unlucky to have missed out on Abadha. I will stay back for one more day, said Sambhunath Jha, a devotee from Rajasthan. Earlier in 2015 and 2011, a cease work agitation by the cooks had deprived Mahaprasad to devotees. Around 600 cooks prepare Mahaprasad for about 10,000 pilgrims everyday and on special occasions, the number touches one lakh. Nearly 20 quintals of rice and 10 quintals of dal besides other vegetables are used to cook the Mahaprasad daily."

Not all weddings and party gatherings might offer sugar-free food, but now cakes, smoothies, and Indian sweets are just a call or online order away. Services like Lotsa Lavender, Awesome Chefs DIY kits, and Smoothie Bar have customised products that are diabetic-friendly. And taking it a step further are shops like Dezire that have a whole range of sweets, jams, squashes, and more, catering only to diabetics.Lavanya Ramu, director, Dezire, says the idea popped up when she noticed diabetic feeling deprived at functions and dinner tables. Since the Indian appetite is used to sweets with ghee and sugar, its only natural to have these cravings. We have about 25 varieties of low-glycemic foods where weve replaced sugar with natural substitutes. We hold a patent for the process too, she shares.(Sources: latest figures from WHO, ICMR, NCBI)Diabetes is a lifestyle disease that is reversible with healthy food habits. Most services that cater to diabetics recognise this and call it a health-friendly switch instead of a diabetic-friendly one. Krishna Pratap, MD, Smoothie Bar, says one of the misconceptions that they try to break is that juices are risky for a diabetic. We have juices and 320 ml drinks which can replace a meal. We work with a dietician, so people can individually chart out a subscription plan according to their tastes and health, he says.To help follow the Low Carb High Fat (LCHF) diet plan strictly, DIY kits by Awesome Chef, cater to anyone who wants to eat healthy while having a variety. Their kits include paneer/chicken jambori with three-four vegetables, balsamic vinegar, herbs and olive oil; butter chicken/paneer/tofu with cauliflower rice, where rice is replaced with granulated and pan-fried cauliflower.Talking about the science that goes into their kits, Anjali Anand, co-founder, Awesome Chef, explains, The body requires additional source of energy, apart from a bowl of vegetables. A diabetic person, can get this by consuming good fats like coconut oil, olive oil, ghee, butter, nuts, seeds, cheese and fresh creams. Nandini Sivakumar, a home-baker who runs Lotsa Lavender, shares that sugar-free alternatives in cakes and pastries are a healthy choice anyone can make. Diabetics, or people with allergies, can customise their cakes. I use palm sugar, jaggery, dates, raisins, and fruits like bananas as sweeteners. Additionally, my cakes are wheat-based, she shares.Going with the saying that anything white is bad for a diabetic, these services find natural substitutes for unhealthy foods. Diabetics can consume a whole range of low-glycemic foods without guilt, and with minimal lifestyle changes.

And sales are surprisingly brisk for a city where theres no need for anything heavier than a light jacket.Every sale we make, theres conversation that Mumbai doesnt have a winter, says Lobsang Chodon, 46, whos been selling items in Parel for eight winters. But Mumbai has plenty of migrants from colder areas, who take items home  the range is wider here especially for children. And its possible to bargain with us. So here we are, on a 33-degree afternoon, selling sweaters.Tibetans have been living in India since 1959.

(Express Photo) Mahim Dargah is a major landmark on Cadell Road. (Express Photo)RUNNNG along the western flank of central Mumbai, the Swatantrya Veer Savarkar Marg is dotted with major Mumbai landmarks, from Mahim Dargah to Shivaji Park to Siddivinayak Temple and the former Mayoral bungalow that will soon be converted into a memorial to the late Bal Thackeray. Named after revolutionary freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the road was renamed decades ago but continues to be known best by its colonial name  Cadell Road, after PR Cadell, former municipal commissioner of the erstwhile Bombay.Cadell, who later went on to become chief secretary, is well known for having written a history of the Bombay Army.Savarkar, who espoused complete Indian independence by revolutionary means, is also credited with coining the term Hindutva. Unknown to many, he lived just off Cadell Road in the 1940s, in what was previously a bungalow named Savarkar Sadan. The property still exists, tucked into a lane off Shivaji Park, with a small memorial to the revolutionary leader on the ground floor.Ranjeet Savarkar, grand-nephew of Vinayak Savarkar, said Savarkar Sadan located on the NB Raut Marg that connects to the present day SVS Road was his home when he moved to Mumbai in 1938.  The construction of the then a two storey building  an additional floor was added later  began in 1937 and my grandfather moved there in 1938. He resided there till 1966, when he passed away, the grandson told The Indian Express.He added,  After his death, the Shiv Sena asked for the road to be named after him. The resolution was unanimously passed.Currently, only a section of Savarkar Sadan is owned by Savarkars daughter-in-law.  A section on the ground floor of the building preserves some of the certificates he had received, Ranjeet added.According to records, before the road was named after Cadell, it was identified by a bazaar held in Mahim. In his book Bombay Place-Names and Street-Names, Samuel T Sheppard writes that the road was earlier called the Mahim Bazaar Road. The Corporation was asked in 1916 to change the name to Cadell Road, in view of the many activities of Mr P R Cadell, C.I.E, ICS ( Municipal Commissioner 1910 -1916) and because the old name has become meaningless as the Bazaar is now of no consequence, according to Sheppard. He adds, It is not quite the case that the name had become meaningless for the Bazaar is still important. But the corporation in deciding on the change included in the proposed Cadell Road not only Mahim Bazaar Road but also Bhandarwada Road and Jambli Tank Road.City historian Deepak Rao said, Cadell was the Municipal Commissioner who went on to become the chief secretary of Bombay. He was also a full colonel in the British army. He has written an important book on the history of the Bombay Army. Rao added that while today the road has several landmarks, in the pre-Independence years it was poorly developed. Siddhivinayak temple was a small temple back then. Shivaji Park itself was carved out in 1925. It was after 1935  1940 that small buildings started coming up in Dadar. Prior to that, the entire area had open rice fields. People hardly went there and hence the road was named after the Bazaar operating at Mahim.Today the road that starts from opposite the St Michaels Church at Mahim and goes right up to Century Bazaar in Worli, where it joins the Dr Annie Besant Road. As one walks some distance from the old Cadell road, one comes across the Makhdoom Ali Mahimi Dargah better known as the Mahim Dargah that attracts devotees and tourists especially for their Thursday Qawwali.Suhail Khandwani, managing trustee of the Mahim Dargah whose family has resided on Savarkar Road for decades, said, Back in the day the Mahim fair that was held on the road was so famous that several top politicians and senior police officers would visit it. He added, In the past few years however, there is so much traffic here that it is not the same road it used to be. Several commercial offices have come here and as a result of his the vehicular traffic has worsened.Also along the road is the Samyukta Maharashtra Smriti Dalan, a memorial to the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement that led to the creation of the state of Maharashtra, with Bombay as capital. Some distance ahead is the west end of the famous Shivaji Park ground, known to have spawned international cricketers from Sachin Tendulkar to Vinod Kambli and which continues to be a major crucible for cricket. Opposite Shivaji Park is the former Mayors bungalow, a heritage site originally inhabited by a princess from Bikaner before the British used it to store official documents.Also located here is the Institute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition, a famous hospitality educational institute and the Antonio DSilva Technical school. Further down the road is the famous Siddhivinayak Temple that has everyone from politicians to film stars coming to seek the blessings of LordGanesha especially before big ticket movie releases.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(Reuters Photo) Anish Bhanwala shot a Games record score of 30 to win mens 25m rapid fire pistol event. (Reuters Photo)The retail store inside the Games Village is like any other. Its customers, though, are not. The Commonwealths top athletes drop by all day, their choices revealing a lot about their eating habits. Rice crackers, the sour cream and chive flavored ones, are the most popular snack among the diet-conscious athletes.Anish Bhanwala, however, has no such worries. Hes scanning the shelves stacked with chocolate bars, accompanied by Manu Bhaker, the 16-year-old shooter who won the gold medal a couple of days ago. The duo leaves with Au$24 worth of bars and candiesa reward for a good days work for Bhanwala.A few hours earlier, Bhanwala had won gold medal in pistol shootings most thrilling event, the rapid fire, like it was stealing candies from a kid; the only difference being that the one who stole it is a kid himself. Bhanwala, 15, became the countrys youngest gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games, bettering the record set by Bhaker. When she won the gold, I thought I had a chance to beat her record become the youngest winner, Bhanwala says, teasingly. This was the only chance because by 2022, I would be older and since shooting isnt there at the CWG in 2022, I would probably have to wait till 2026.Anish Bhanwala won a gold medal in Mens 25m Rapid Fire Pistol. (Reuters Photo) Anish Bhanwala won a gold medal in Mens 25m Rapid Fire Pistol. (Reuters Photo)Bhanwala and Bhaker are two teenagers lost in the eccentric world of a Games Village. Most things are off limits to them, with coach Jaspal Rana ensuring they spend most time either at the gym or at the training centre. Recreation is an hour or two at the games room, where they indulge in a game of table tennis. And when he has time, Bhanwala deals with his worries that dog a normal Class 10 student like solving a math problem.When he returns to Delhi next week, Bhanwala will not be spending time attending felicitations. I have to give my board exams, he says. Last month, Bhanwala arrived from his maiden World Cup in Mexico at the dead of night and at the crack of dawn next day, he sat for a class X board paper. He appeared for two exams English and science before leaving for the junior World Cup and the CWG.When he returns, the situation wont be any different. His remaining three papers math, social science and Hindiwill be held from April 16 to 18, and on the 19th, he leaves for a World Cup in South Korea. Hindi is easy and I can manage SS. Math is the toughest, he says.Bhanwala is here with his books but hasnt had the time to study. He got an exemption from the CBSE board for the exams. There is a procedure for that. I mailed them from the school first and then the sports ministry also recommended to the board, he says.Anish Bhanwala (C) is praised by bronze medallist Sam Gowin of England. (AP Photo) Anish Bhanwala (C) is praised by bronze medallist Sam Gowin of England. (AP Photo)But if he is any good at studies as he is at sport, Bhanwala wont have to worry. He began as a pentathlete where, as a 10-year-old, he competed in the modern pentathlon junior world championship. Among the five sports, Bhanwala was hooked the most to shooting, where he shot the laser pistol events.His remarkable scores lured him into pursuing the sport full time but it wasnt until last year when he burst onto the international scene as a prodigious 14-year-old with two golds, two silvers and a bronze medal at the junior world championships. At the same tournament, he created a world record en route to clinching the 25-metre standard pistol gold.In December, he competed at the CWG range for the first time during a test event. Back then, hed won a rapid fire silver. He bettered the colour of the medal on Friday, but as was the case with Bhaker, Rana is concerned that they might lose their way after the numerous felicitations and cash prizes that routinely follow a medal at events like the CWG.Anish Bhanwala with his gold medal. Anish Bhanwala with his gold medal.The biggest issues with an athlete arent the external factors. Its how they themselves deal with the fame that follows, Rana says. Anish will now get lakhs of rupees in prize money. Its easy to get distracted and lose the hunger to continue shooting well. The challenge is to keep them focused.Bhanwala stands next to Rana, with hands on his back and mischievous grin  like a pupil being lectured by the school principal. He isnt concerned about losing focus and the cash prizes. Right now, he seems content just by someone paying the bills for his chocolates.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

Millets are a naturally rich source of vitamins and micro-nutrients.Rajasthan is the top producer of coarse cereals in the country. Millets are mostly cultivated in low-fertile lands, mountainous terrain, tribal and rain-fed areas in states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.Supply of cheap millets to poor households and through school midday meals will improve nutrition outcomes among the poor and also boost incomes of small farmers, the minister said.According to agriculture ministry data, the area under millets has been declining. Despite growing demand for millets from urban consumer because of their natural high content of vitamins, proteins, oils and minerals, in 2016-17, the area under millet cultivation declined to 14.72 million hectares, down 60% compared to the previous year. India produces, on an average, over 40 million tonnes of coarse cereals.The ministry is rolling out a programme called nutri-cereals under the National Food Security Mission to increase output of millets, such as jowar (sorghum), bajra (pearl millet) and ragi (finger millet) as well as indigenous indigenous little millets known as kutki, kodo, sawa, kangni and cheena. The government has declared 2018 as the National Year of Millets.Last July , Prime Minister Modi had called for inclusion of millets under the public distribution system. Following this, a meeting of the consultative committee on agriculture headed by NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand was held in October 2017. Based on the recommendations of NITI Aayog, the agriculture ministry has decided to create a sub-mission on nutri-cereals.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, millets are drought-tolerant and resistant to climate change. Cultivation of millets requires less water than rice and wheat, which makes them suitable for small growers."

Now, the government has gone a step further by deciding to allot transportation work directly to arhtiyas on nomination basis in such clusters, said an officer privy to the development.Principal Secretary, food and supplies, KAP Sinha has written to Mandi Board for fixation of transportation charges per quintal per kilometre payable to arhtiyas during the Rabi season 2018-19.The Mandi Board fixes the rates of cleaning, weighing, stitching and loading of foodgrains for arhtiyas. This is the first-time ever commission agents are being involved in foodgrain transportation. The state has about 20,000 arhtiyas.The government move came barely hours after the Punjab Truck Operators Union, which held a meeting of its district chiefs and members of workingcommittee at Sahnewal, decided not to participate in the tendering process for wheat transportation. The boycott will continue. After the Patiala meeting, we checked with all truck operators. About 75% of them refused to work at rates being offered by the government for transportation of wheat and paddy procured in the state, said union president Happy Sandhu, putting the number of truck operators associated with his organisation at 93,000.Despite the boycott call, the state government has gone ahead with finalisation of bids. Of 402 clusters, technical bids for 205 have been finalised and financial bids will be opened on Wednesday, said the officer. In nine districts, bids for all clusters have been more or less finalised. These include Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Mansa, Pathankot, Muktsar Fazilka, Kapurthala and Ropar. In the remaining 197 clusters, only 121 bids have been received. And, it is in such clusters where there are no bids that the government intends to award the transportation work to arhtiyas.Truck operators and the state government have been at loggerheads from the time the latter decided to cap the foodgrain transportation rates.The operators were charging much higher rates than those at which reimbursement was being made by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to the state government. The FCI reimburses the government at a fixed schedule of rates (SOR) with a premium, but there was a huge disparity in rates across districts for the same distance.While the FCI paid the state about 350 crore for transportation last year, the fund-starved government had to take a hit of about Rs 175 crore, said the officer requesting anonymity.The food and supplies department decided to cap the premium at 120% over and above SOR this time. However, truck operators rejected the cap, saying they would not be able to meet their operational costs at these rates."

Former minister and Kapurthala MLA Rana Gurjit Singh and Markfed chairman AS Samra were also present at the meeting.While truckers have now agreed to participate in the tender process, there are very few clusters left for bidding. The department has finalised the bids for 341 (about 82%) of the total 413 clusters in the state. They can bid for only 73 leftover clusters  20 of these are in the truck unions stronghold of Sangrur. The tenders for most of these will be opened in next three days. They are also hoping to participate in tenders in case the department cancels the contracts for any cluster due to default.While truck operators were adamant, rice millers and others saw an opportunity and successfully bid for transportation contracts in many clusters. The state authorities had allowed rice millers and arhtiyas (commission agents) to participate in bids in their attempt to tame the truck operators.Anindita Mitra said their talks with trucker operatives were constructive. The provisions in transportation policy were explained. They understood the situation and agreed to work with the department for smooth transportation of wheat procured in the state, she said.The department officials had held talks with truck operators on March 31 also, but they had decided to continue their boycott at that time. The state government and truck operators were at loggerheads from the time the latter decided to cap the foodgrain transportation rates.Transporters had formed cartels and were charging excessively high rates for the past several years even as the state was being reimbursed only a part of it by the centre. The end result was the state government was paying a substantial amount of money from its exchequer. Now, we will be able to save about 175 crore, said a department official.As the FCI reimburses the government at a fixed schedule of rates (SOR) and allows some premium, it decided to cap the premium at 120% over and above SOR this time. The truck unions responded by boycotting the tender process, saying they would not be able to meet their operational costs at these rates. However, the department went ahead with tenders and finalised most of them, forcing truck unions to fall in line."

It will take a long time for us to rebuild our lives, but people came to help us within hours, said Vishnu, a native of West Champaran who ran a small tailoring shop in Kanawani near his tenement. Within two hours on Tuesday, Vishnu, had lost his home and the means to rebuild it.After the tragedy struck Kanawani, dozens of residents from the towering high-rises in Indirapuram, the Ghaziabad police, and the municipal corporation came forward to help.SK Jain, a retired officer from IEL, Kanpur, arrived from the Pinnacle Tower nearby with a group of 10 residents and set up a food stall by a burnt tree. We prepared food for nearly 1,000 people and will give them more help in coming time. We are collecting materials and money from residents in our high-rise, Jain said.Members of the federation of association of apartment owners also distributed food packets, water and clothes.From our federation fund, we are trying to get at least 100 durries (floor spreads) from Chandni Chowk. These can be used by families to sleep on as theyre sleeping on the floor, which is basically mud, Alok Kumar, president of the federation, said, adding that they are also collecting items of daily need and getting more aid, in cash and in kind, from residents.The rising heat is also making it difficult for the destitute families who are completely exposed to the elements, and thus more vulnerable to diseases.We used to pay 1,500 to 2,500 as rent for our tenements here. Now, the land owner is refusing to set up shelters again, said Saraswati, who is from Betia in Bihar.Mamta Devi, who rescued her daughters despite being pregnant, pitched four sticks around the space where her house once was and spread a half-burnt saree to create shelter from the sun.Most of the families are trying to cover them from heat this way. I lost my house and also my grocery shop. Luckily my family was saved. If the incident had happened during night, there would have been many casualties, said Subrata Saha, a resident and native of Farukkhabad.Dr Renu Verma, a medical practitioner and social activist from Noida, is among the few who are providing medical aid. Dr Verma, who arrived with a group of volunteers, said, We have come here to assess the needs of the people. We will be sending a team of doctors for medical checkups and to provide medicines. The families have pregnant women. The victims will also need psychological therapy.An ambulance from the nearby Shanti Gopal Hospital was also stationed at the spot as doctors distributed medicines.Some people who suffered minor burn injuries are being treated. Those who have other complications will be treated for free at the hospital. We are trying to arrange for 100 tarpaulin sheets which will give families relief from the scorching heat, said Arun Agarwal, owner of the hospital.Local residents of Kanawani village, too, have come forward to help the affected in their hour of need.Class 10 students Sumit and Rohit skipped school on Tuesday to distribute cooked food and water packets.We have organised a bhandara (community kitchen) and are distributing potatoes, pooris and rice to the affected families. Villagers have pooled in money and we will continue to give them food for a few more days, said Bijender Singh, a resident of Kanawani.Bijenders sister Anita Verma also arrived from Niti Khand with her family and children to help.I specially brought my teenage children to understand what is hardship and that children from well-off families should know their responsibility towards the poor and teach them the spirit of charity, she said.Pradeep Kumar, who lead a group of volunteers from Sewa Bhati, an NGO, cleaned the area. Garbage needs to be cleared. The administration should also come out and help in rehabilitation of the affected people, he said.While the Ghaziabad police pitched in with nearly 200 food packets on Tuesday, municipal commissioner CP Singh sent three teams to clean the area, and address the hygienic issues that may crop up.

The Mandi Parishad employees will now visit their (farmers) doorsteps to purchase the farm produce at minimum support price, agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal said.This is the first of its kind initiative in the state, for which it (mandi parishad) has already been allocated a revolving fund of 10 crore.Uniyal said the move would directly benefit the farmers as they would get adequate price for their farm produce.The Mandi Parishad will purchase five types of millets and grains from farmers, he said referring to Chaulai (amaranth), Maduwa (Ragi), Jhingora (barnyard millet), Kuttu (buckwheat) and Koni (foxtail millet).Uniyal said initially, the scheme had been launched in Almora and Chamoli.In the next phase, it will be extended to other districts before all the districts will be covered under the scheme, he said.Uniyal said the scheme was aimed to ensure that farmers get full benefits by selling their crops at minimum support price, which will soon be announced by the government. It will also motivate more and more farmers to produce millets and food grains.The minister said apart from benefiting farmers, the scheme would also benefit thousands of school going children.Some of these nutritious food grains are proposed to be a part of the midday meal scheme meant for schools, Uniyal said. As of now, they are provided rice and vegetables as part of a midday meal."

Kashmiri pashmina, Darjeeling tea, Kancheepuram silk and Tirupati laddoo have all been granted GIs.The GI tag will ensure that no one else can use the name Kadaknath while selling any other black chicken and will also translate into higher prices for producers, officials in the animal husbandry department said.Madhya Pradesh filed an application with the GI registry office in 2012 and the Chhattisgarh government filed its claim in 2017. The news that Chhattisgarh too had applied for the same GI tag had alarmed the Madhya Pradesh government, which redoubled its efforts to ensure its variety won .We had prepared well and had given all the necessary proofs, so I was confident of the result, the minister added.Kadaknath is in demand not only because of its taste but also due to its low cholesterol and high protein content. It sells at about Rs 500 per kg, which is around five times the price of normal broiler chicken.MP commissioner for cooperatives, Renu Pant, said 23-odd cooperatives formed by tribals, or more than 500 people, are engaged in breeding of these birds.We have plans to provide loans to all these cooperatives so that they can purchase hatching machines and increase production, Pant said.Jhabua collector Ashish Saxena said the administration was planning to increase the sale to 100 birds per day from the present 20, especially after the launch of Kadaknath app, which provides all the details of the variety to buyers.The Chhattisgarh government had applied for the GI tag following the success of a breeding project in Dantewada.Dantewada collector Saurabh Kumar said about 120 self help groups (SHGs) are rearing a black chicken variety in Dantewada and 1,600 women are earning a livelihood from selling these birds.We will study the decision (of the GI registry) and will try and find out ways in which we can protect the interest of poor tribal farmers of Bastar, who have been successfully breeding this chicken, Kumar said.As long as we are able to sell Kadaknath at good price for farmers, the GI is not an issue and the price will not fall by itself. We will see how this turns out, he added.The GI registry recently dismissed Madhya Pradeshs plea for inclusion of basmati rice grown in the central Indian state.(With inputs from CB Singh in Jhabua)"

(Express photo by Gurmeet Singh) Khanna grain market. (Express photo by Gurmeet Singh)As wheat procurement process is likely to start from the first week of April, Punjab government has made a few amendments in its newly-framed policy in wake of a boycott by the truck unions of the state, protesting less prices they are being offered this time as compared to last year.As per the amendment, rice sheller and commission agents (Ahrtiya) associations of respective districts can also participate in the tender process for transporting grains from mandis to godowns, in case the tenders are not allotted in three consecutive times.It needs to be mentioned that out of 134 clusters of mandis in Malwa and Doaba, tenders for not more than 14-15 have been allotted to truckers. The rest did not participate in the tender process. This year a capping of 120 per cent has been kept on basic rates, which was not there last year, due to which truckers feel that they will be under heavy losses.However, in order to let the procurement work start in mandis from coming April, Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of respective districts have approached the rice shellers and ahrtiyas to participate in the tender process.Ghanshyam Thori, DC, Sangrur, confirmed that as the truck unions have gone on strike and not participated in the tender process, they have asked people from outside to take part. We have received positive response from rice shellers as well as ahrtiyas. They have over 1,000 large trucks, which can keep the work going. At the same time, we are hopeful that truckers will also fall in line soon, said the Thori.The government has given another relaxation of giving a CAs certificate, showing working capital of any firm, for participating in the tender process. Earlier, the transporters needed to show a banks working capital certificate, which most of them had denied.The transporters have also been asked to give a manual list of truck numbers to the district administration office instead of uploading them on an e-vahan software. The above relaxations have been done to attract the truckers as they were not ready to give their last years working capital certificate and upload the exact number of truck numbers on the vahan software.Happy Sandhu, president of Punjabs truck union, said only a few have applied in the tender process in Malwa and Doaba. We have not got any call from state government for talks and we are being threatened to face police cases if we stop others. However, time will tell how we are going to respond to this threat, he said.Sandhu added that the DCs have planned to enroll even the trolley owners for lifting, which they will not let happen.For all the latest Ludhiana News, download Indian Express App"

The short grained rice is grown natively in Bhagalpur and Banka districts of Bihar.Due to its uniqueness, it is facing threat of extinction. It is said soil composition of the area contributes to its uniqueness.Zardalu mangoes are grown in Bhagalpur district. A Zardalu mango usually weighs between 220gm and 250mg.The mango variant, which is popular for its thin peel and aroma, has been on the state governments annual gift list for some 40 VVIPs including President of India and the Prime Minister.Magahi paan is an expensive variety of betel which is grown in Aurangabad, Gaya and Nalanda districts of central Bihar. Its non-fibrous, sweeter, tastier and the softest of the lot.Details of these produces were earlier included in the Geographical Indicator Journal (GIJ) dated November 28, 2017. The journal was made available in public domain as the GI had set a three-month time frame for people to challenge contents of the journal concerning the exclusive produces.It is believed that Maharaja Rahmat Ali Khan Bahadur of Kharagpur was the first person to get Katarni planted in Bhagalpur region. The variety had originated as superior chance seedling. In GIJ, it is mentioned that Katarni rice is one of the famous fine grain quality scented rice of Bihar.To establish its origin in Bhagalpur, the applicant, the Bhagalpur Jardalu Aam Utpadak Sangh of village Maheshi in Sultanganj block, had referred to a 200-year-old Jardalu tree in Tagepur village which, they claim, is the mother of all Jardalus in the region.The Bhagalpur Katarni Dhaan Utpadak Sangh applied for GI registration of the rice variant while the Magahi Paan Utpadak Kalyan Samiti of village Deuri in Nalanda district was the applicant for the Magahi Paan.As proof of their claim that its origin is in Bihar, the samiti referring to different books had mentioned that Magahi paan was popular even during ancient times.It claimed that prince Vijai Mal was fond of Magahi paan and it is mentioned in the 1884 book of GA Grierson, an Irish administrator and linguist in British India. Several other references had been cited in the journal to establish Magahi paan being an exclusive produce of Magadh region.BLURBThe exclusive identity will help boost export potential of the products.

But foodgrain purchase remained slow at 17-18 lakh tonne every month, at least 2 lakh tone less than the past years.The state procurement agencies are having a tough time as a stalemate has prevailed between truckers and the Punjab government over the cap imposed on wheat transportation rates. To deal with this situation, senior Punjab government officials are contemplating to impose Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) on truckers for smooth transportation of wheat.The state has a total closed storage capacity of 153 lakh tonnes, of which FCI has 103 lakh tonne capacity while five state procurement agencies have the rest of the storage.Right now, warehouses in Punjab have 26 lakh tonne wheat of the previous season and 90 lakh tonne rice. FCI is waiting for handing over of 14 lakh tonne rice by the state rice mills. It is going to be a tough season for us as wheat is usually not stored in open plinths. We have closed storage area available for only 35 lakh tonnes, said a senior FCI officer.We have come up with a storage policy and have called for expressions of interest (EoIs) to arrange cover and plinths space for wheat storage, said Anandita Mitra, director food and civil supplies, Punjab.She said the government will manage to store the wheat if the arrival remains somewhere between 118-120 lakh tonnes but they may face difficulty if procurement reaches 130 lakh tonne mark as predicted by the state agriculture department.We are hoping that pace of foodgrain lifting by the Centre picks up to make the situation easy, said Mitra."

In short distance category (within eight kilometres), labour and cartage contracts have been finalised for 165 of the 314 clusters.With truck unions boycotting the tendering process, the response from rice millers and other splinter groups has provided much-needed relief to state authorities. They had allowed rice millers to participate in the tendering process for transportation of wheat from grain markets to storage godowns.Special helpline, security for biddersThe government, which has refused to give in to the truck operators agitating against its decision to cap the rates, has deployed 1,000 police personnel to provide security to bidders and set up a special 181 toll free helpline, said the officer requesting anonymity. The state top brass had on Friday considered the possibility invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) to ensure smooth procurement and transportation of wheat in the state in case the truck operators do not fall in line or create trouble.Punjab Truck Operators Union president Happy Sandhu, who first held a meeting of working committee of all unions and then met the state officials in Patiala, said there was no headway as the government refused to increase the rate and the truck operators were not willing to carry foodgrains at the rate being offered.We suggested Rs 2,200 a day plus diesel from the department for carrying nine tonnes of wheat for a distance of nine kms as against Rs 1,650 being offered. But, they said the centre does not give that much, he said.Unions meet on April 3The union has asked all its district chiefs to meet the operaters in their respective areas to take their view and will hold another meeting at Sahnewal on April 3 to decide its future strategy. The state transporters have been charging high rates for carrying foodgrains in the past 8 to 10 years, bleeding the state exchequer. However, the fund-crunched government decided this time to align the rates with the reimbursement it gets from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for transporation of wheat and paddy procured in the state."

In fact, having every day meals for consumers has evolved to a point where food delivery has become a must-have feature for every restaurant, big or small.The delivery feature in restaurants improves customer satisfaction, increases reach, and also boosts profits for restaurant. Since we launched in Chennai, the number of restaurant partners on our platform has increased four-fold, says Bhavik Rathod, head, Uber Eats India.Deterred by urban challenges of long working hours, traffic and parking concerns, Chennaites, especially youngsters, are turning to delivery apps to enjoy a meal in the comforts of their homes and offices. Chennai loves to order in. We have seen spikes in dinner orders on weekends but lunch orders are predominantly higher here. While lunch combos and mini meals are a hit during weekdays, biryani and varieties of dosas are a hit over the weekends, he shares.In an already tough restaurant landscape, where new restaurants emerge and disappear every month, technology has a growing role to play, changing the way people eat, shares the official spokesperson of Swiggy. Chennai is a key market for Swiggy. We have consistently seen an increase in the number of daily orders, ever since we began operations in November 2015.Today, over 2,200 restaurants in the city are digitally accessible to customers through Swiggy, and Chennaites have been able to savour food from a host of restaurants, ranging from QSRs, to popular eateries to trendy new cafes in the city, including Pantry dor, Double Roti, Ciclo Cafe, Amethyst and Chamiers Cafe.Currently clocking three million orders a month across the country, Naren Devanathan, team lead, online ordering, Zomato, shares, We get over 50,000 unique users in Chennai on the Zomato app every day.

Would you be up to avoid dairy products from your diet especially if you could get the right amount of proteins without them? Though the concept of avoiding any kind of animal products was officially established more than 70 years ago in the West, it took some time to become a trend in India. And in Chennai, particularly, veganism has been gaining popularity in the last couple of years.The city even witnessed a completely eco-friendly vegan wedding recently! I attended the wedding a few days back. And they served the yummiest butterscotch ice cream. It was made out of cotton seed milk, recalls Anu Vidya M, who runs the Instagram account @Chennai_vegan_ foodguide.Vegetarian vs Vegan Although many people tend to confuse vegan and vegetarian, veganism is basically an extension of vegetarianism, wherein the diet includes no food or products from animals. People tend to eat more of beans, lentils, tofu, etc, Basically no meat or poultry. It is just like how vegetarians do, but also we say no to dairy/ honey/ eggs, point out Roshni Sanghvi, body transformation specialist. Minal Agrawal who administers the Facebook page Veganennai, says that veganism is popular only in the metros and that too because of social media. Veganism is yet to reach smaller cities and town.Whether youre non-vegetarian and vegetarian, youre being cruel to animals. Veganism is against all the cruelty towards animals, she highlights. Indianised cuisine Food, in general, can be made vegan. It can have anything except for any product derived from an animal. So dairy products, eggs and meat is a complete no-no, says Sarmishta Baliga, head pastry chef, Ashvita Bistro. The taste and flavours still remain the same as any other cuisine.Is there a specialised Indian menu in terms of vegan food? Traditionally, most Indian cooking, especially south Indian vegetarian cooking, is vegan. Barring the popular curd rice and use of a little ghee while tempering for most dishes and desserts, most south Indian food is vegan in itself, explains Sruthi Harihara Subramanian, owner, Ashvita. Benefits Vegan food has several health benefits, including no risk of heart problems and cholesterol.Roshni points out that unlike meat and egg, which leads to higher levels of cholesterol and heart diseases, a plant-based whole-food vegan diet has almost no cholesterol. Dairy has been linked to indigestion, acne, headaches, diabetes, cancer, and a whole range of lifestyle diseases and disorders.A plant-based diet is also lower in calories and much more nutritious, she adds. Vegan food also promotes a healthy environment. You are reducing your carbon footprint, hence reducing damage to the environment, says Anu.Feasibility Minal, who became a vegan in 2011, says that cutting costs is easier if youre a vegan. People think it is not feasible; in fact, it is the opposite. Its easy and affordable to make dairy and meat alternatives at home. Roshni concurs and adds that most food we eat is accidentally vegan and almost everything can easily be customised. For instance, vegetarian Asian food is almost 100% vegan since they use tofu instead of paneer and no other dairy products. Abroad, the options are much more compared to India, but the Indian market is changing, she adds. Though awareness and acceptability is growing, its slow, claims A Mohamed Zakaria of Veganer restaurant, who had to shut down a couple of places, due to the same reason. We had formally opened the restaurant in September 2014.Since the awareness of vegan food is less in Chennai when compared to other cities, we couldnt get much response as we had expected. Hence, we decided to close the outlets in Anna Nagar, Ascendas Food"

Usage of such a certification on a product would indicate that it possesses certain qualities exclusive to its land of origin.The chief minister said state farmers have been producing basmati since 1908. As much as 50% of the rice exported to Canada and America comes from Madhya Pradesh. A few exporters, particularly those from Pakistan, do not want basmati rice produced here to acquire a global identity certification, a state government spokesperson quoted Chouhan as saying in a television news programme on Sunday evening. We will fight for our basmati-producing farmers and emerge victorious in the end.Chinnaraja G Naidu, assistant registrar of the GI registry, had stated on March 15 that while the evidence filed by entities in Madhya Pradesh depicts the importance and special characteristics of rice grown in the state, it does not do the same for basmati in traditional cultivation areas. The opponent has, therefore, failed to satisfy the fundamental requirements of popular public perception of Basmati cultivation in Madhya Pradesh as mentioned by the honourable Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) in Chennai A mere plea without the backing of any corroborative evidence has no gravity in the eyes of the law, he added.While the respondent or applicant in this case was the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), the opponents comprised the Madhya Kshetra Basmati Growers Association Samiti, Raisen; Narmada Cereals Private Limited, Mandideep, Raisen; SSA International Limited, Mandideep, Raisen; Madhya Kshetra Basmati Exporters Association, Udaipura, Raisen; the additional director of agriculture, department of farmer welfare and agriculture development, government of Madhya Pradesh; and Daawat Foods Limited, New Delhi.A senior official of the state agriculture department said they were studying the order in detail. As there is an option to appeal against the order before IPAB within three months, we are seeking legal opinions on how best to do it, he said on the condition of anonymity.It has been nearly a decade since Madhya Pradesh began fighting its battle for inclusion into an Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) list of basmati-growing states. It had even won a legal battle before the GI registry in 2013, but IPAB rejected the claim three years later on an appeal filed by APEDA.Madhya Pradesh claims that it has been growing basmati rice since 1908."

This study confirms, for instance, that Dravidian speakers were present in the subcontinent before the Indo-Aryan speakers arrived (around 3,500 years ago). We know about this from Dravidian (word) loans into Sanskrit but this is a confirmation, said lead author Annemarie Verkerk of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany.One thing we dont know is which Dravidian language(s) were in contact with Sanskrit; if we have an idea of the timing, we can make inferences on which ancestral language this could have been, said Verkerk. The same goes for contact with Munda (An Austro-Asiatic language spoken in Eastern India) speakers and relationships with the isolate languages of the subcontinent.The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, suggests that it is likely the Dravidian languages were much more widespread to the west of India in the past than they are today.For instance, Brahui, perhaps the oldest of the Dravidan family, is spoken by 600,000 people in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, and 10,000 more speak Dangar in Nepal, according to the Thiruvananthapuram-based Dravidian Linguistics Association.Because some of the Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tulu) have very long literary traditions, we can link certain diversification events (such as the split between Tamil and Malayalam) to real chronological time. These so-called calibration points help to map lexical change in the entire family to real time, and that is how we get the age for the ancestor of all Dravidian languages, said Verkerk.Archaeological inferences date back the diversification of Dravidian into Northern, Central, and Southern branches to 4,500 years, coinciding with the beginnings of cultural developments found in archaeological records.We know rice was being cultivated in south India 10,000-11,000 years ago and an agrarian society calls for communication using at least basic sound icons to articulate thought processes, said Ganesh N Devy, linguist and founder-director of the Bhasha Research and Publication Centre, Vadodara. Devy led the Peoples Linguistic Survey of India in 2010, which documented 780 living Indian languages.In the absence of carbon dating and neuroscience to study structures of language perception to date language, advanced statistical models provide crucial bits of evidence that piece together the evolution of languages, he added."

Opposition parties and activists have been alleging irregularities in the public distribution system, especially in the Chief Ministers pet Anna Bhagya scheme.The Siddaramaiah government, which came to power in May 2013, launched the Anna Bhagya scheme the same year.The objective was to provide subsidised food grains to below poverty line (BPL) families. While initially it was about supplying 30kg rice per family at Re 1 a kg, the government later modified it to provide 7kg of rice per head for free. In Karnataka, 1.1 crore families (more than four crore people) are eligible to get free rice and grains every month under the scheme from more than 21,000 fair price shops spread across the state.A senior officer in the department said the last three years were hectic for the commissioner. We were linking Aadhaar with ration cards, and thus deleting bogus cards. When we started linking, there was pressure from various influential people. There was non-cooperation from the staff too. In this process, unable to handle pressure, some sought transfers and some got transferred, the officer said.If officers are transferred after short tenures, they cannot work efficiently. One needs at least two months to even know the systems in place and how the department functions, said an IAS officer.Retired IAS officer M N Vijaykumar said with the well-intended Anna Bhagya scheme, corruption in the department has actually increased.In fact, I had filed a complaint in 2014 about this, but nothing has been done so far, he said. Explaining the reasons for the frequent transfers, he said: Here, no officer -- whether IAS or KAS -- is allowed to stay for more than one year. Some corrupt IAS officers seek transfers within a short duration. This is because in case of a scam in their tenure, they do not want to be held accountable.When contacted, Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader said, It is not a good trend to transfer officers holding one of the highest posts in the department. However, we have not done it. Some people take transfers after reporting. Some of them do not work effectively. Through our Anna Bhagya scheme, we supply 7 kg of rice to 4 crore people. One can imagine the workload. In some cases, the commissioner and the higher-ups do not gel well; so either the secretary seeks a transfer of the commissioner or the commissioner himself seeks a transfer."

Confused? Well, these are hay and bamboo replicas of famous buildings that will be set on fire to create a bonfire, called Meji, as part of the three-day celebrations of the Assamese harvest festival Magh Bihu, popularly called Bhogali Bihu. Bhogali comes from the word bhog which means feast.Magh Bihu is a time for community feasting and thanksgiving to God for a rich harvest and on Saturday, people will light the Meji and seek the blessings of elders. They will throw rice cakes and betel nuts into the fire and offer prayers. The rituals will be followed by a community feast.Meanwhile, the increasing competition to erect eye-catching replicas has led to some criticism from traditionalists who say that erection and then burning of replicas of historical buildings, monuments and temples is not part of the tradition. They also point out that dance is an integral part of the spring festival Rongali Bihu, not Magh Bihu.What people are doing now is not the culture of the Assamese. We should be able to reject them, said Asom Sanmilita Mahasangha in a statement. It appealed to the people to protect the purity and tradition of Bihu.Meanwhile, Governor Jagdish Mukhi extended Bihu greetings to the people of Assam. Bihu symbolises the spirit of integrity, brotherhood and camaraderie amongst all the people irrespective of their caste, creed, religion or language. It is a festival of community feasting and symbolises love and mutual respect. The spontaneous celebrations of the Bhogali Bihu by people transcending all social barriers symbolize the spirit of unity amidst diversity, the governor said in his message."

It is four days of festivities and feasting. But is there something more to it? I have learnt important lessons from this lovely festival and thought would share them with you. First day, Bhogi: Management Lesson  Letting goOn this day people get up early. They discard old things and concentrate on change or transformation. At dawn, people light a bonfire with logs of wood, old mats and wooden furniture at home that are not useful. This is where all old habits, vices, and attachment to material things are sacrificed in the fire. Second day, Pongal: Management Lesson  Looking aheadPongal signals new beginnings. Its a new dawn of opportunities. Tradition has it that, it is the period the gods are awake and hence, there are positive vibrations and energetic activities everywhere.People normally wait for Pongal to kickstart new projects and begin new assignments. Having let go of old and outdated thoughts, habits and ideas, there is ample room and scope for innovation. Third day, Mattu Pongal: Management Lesson  Living in harmonyThis day signifies celebration of relationships. It announces the homecoming of ladies. It is customary for girls/brides to begin living in their husbands homes after their wedding vows are taken. In some communities, brothers give gifts to the sisters and sisters pray for the relationship to be everlasting. Animals, especially cows and bullocks, are also acknowledged as a part of the family. The crow is also invited to feed on mixed rice and fruit early in the morning. Last day, Kaanum Pongal: Management Lesson  Learning to celebrateKaanum Pongal literally means seeing new things. People from neighbouring villages visit the cities for sightseeing. They are dressed in new clothes  colourful and resplendent  and the entire day is devoted to being together During these three days, old habits and practices, ill feeling and low moments are given up and forgotten. New beginnings are aplenty. Fresh thoughts and ideas emerge and are put into practice. Both friends and relatives come together in all their splendour to celebrate life.From a management perspective, Pongal is not just a harvest festival of feasting and celebration. Its an occasion for self-assessment, mid-course correction and quality improvement towards attainment of lifes goals that calls for a grand celebration.(The writer is the principal of MOP Vaishnav College for Women)"

One of the most sought after snacks prepared during the festival is ariselu, a flattened roti-shaped sweet made of soaked rice flour and jaggery which is crusted with sesame seeds and fried in ghee or oil.Then there is sakinalu, a traditional snack of Telangana region, a concentric circular savoury made of rice flour and fried in oil. Sesame seeds and carom are also added to the dough to provide taste to the crunchy snack.Appalu and murukulu are some other snacks for the festival, which are also made from rice flour. Nuvvula laddu, a popular sweet prepared with sesame seeds, nuts and jaggery is popular in Telangana as well as neighbouring Maharashtra.A speciality of the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh is pootharekulu, a sweet which resembles folded paper. The sweet is made from a special rice batter, ghee and sugar or jaggery. Other regions have their favourites too. Bandar laddu, a sweet made from besan and ghee originates from Machlipatnam while the layered madatha kaja hails from Kakinada and Tapeswaram.One place in Hyderabad that can be visited for the entire range of Sankranti delicacies is Vellanki Foods, which is around for 30 years and has four branches in different parts of the city.According to Vijitha Vellanki, one of the owners, ariselu, nuvvula laddu and sakinalu make for bumper sale during the festival. Apart from these they also make some special dishes like poornalu and chakra pongali only for this special period. One of their signature sweets is kajjikayulu or garijalu, a fried sweet similar to gujiya of North India. It has a crunchy top but as you bite inside the sweet filling of rawa, cashewnut and jaggery is overwhelming. Vellanki Foods also has an online portal through which you can order their Sankranti delicacies from the comfort of your home.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

Now, the two cant agree on how to get going.These new markets, essentially village haats, are conceived as aggregation points for farmers with minimal rules. The aim is to provide an alternative to rigged farm-to-fork supply chains that drive down farmers profits.The agriculture ministry and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), administered by the finance ministry, have both offered to set up these markets.But they arent exactly on the same page. In fact, the approaches are quite opposite and we need to determine a way out, a government official said on condition of anonymity.Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the Narendra Modi government is seeking to address widespread farm distress caused by drought-induced crop failures and a decline in agricultural commodity prices in recent years.The proposed new markets are a part of the effort for which the latest budget created a Rs 2,000-crore agri-market infrastructure fund.A part of the fund could also be used to modernise the existing wholesale market network, the agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) controlled by middlemen, a legacy of the so-called licence raj.The new markets are proposed to be kept outside the APMC system in a bid to liberalise farm trade.The agriculture ministry has begun a national survey of these village markets strewn across states, which mostly operate on panchayat land. Nabards proposal is to give subsidised loans at 4.75% interest, for which it has sought an interest subvention grant of Rs 360 crore under the agri-market fund. It wants the states to guarantee these loans.The agriculture ministrys proposal, which does not mention any of the costs, merely states that mechanisms are being explored to develop these markets, a second government official said. The agriculture ministry doesnt agree with the Nabard proposal; the ministry says state governments are unlikely to guarantee these loan because of high possibility of default by panchayats. The ministry prefers a private-public partnership mode.Given that the project essentially involves building storage and trading infrastructure, the agriculture ministry wants to draw on some existing schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), the national rural road-building programme. It also wants to merge the scheme with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) that offers 100 days of work to at least one member of every rural household each year. The PMGSY already gives priority to building roads that connect rural markets, the official cited in the first instance said, adding that MGNREGS funds could be used for building public facilities, like markets.Lack of transparent markets is a key reason for falling farm incomes. As the marketable surplus of various commodities rises, reforming agricultural markets has become essential. For instance, The all-India average marketed surplus (total quantity brought to markets as a ratio of total quantity produced) for tur (pigeon peas, a pulses variety) was 88.21% in 2014-15, according to the Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2016. The figure for rice and wheat for that year stood at 84.35% and 73.78%.Whatever the policy, removing inefficiencies is agricultural marketing cannot happen without states taking the lead role in it. The Centre, I feel, will have limited success if it cant get states to agree on common norms, like it did for the Goods and Services Tax, said Suresh Nath, an economist who served the erstwhile Planning Commission.A committee formed to suggest measures to double farm incomes has proposed placing agricultural marketing under the concurrent list (in the seventh schedule of the Constitution). This will enable both the Centre and states to legislate on the subject, which currently falls squarely in the states domain."

Photo: Priyanka Parashar/MintNew Delhi: The Centres food subsidy bill is likely to go up by 10% to around Rs1.60 lakh crore in the 2018-19 budget due to rise in minimum support prices but no change in subsidised rates of foodgrains, sources said.The 2018-19 Union Budget will be presented on 1 February. Since November 2016, the government is implementing the National Food Security Act, under which foodgrains are supplied every month at a highly subsidised rates of Rs1-3 per kg to over 80 crore people in the country.For the 2017-18 fiscal, the government has earmarked Rs1,45,338 crore for food subsidy. This is likely to increase by at least 10% in the 2018-19 fiscal, sources said.The total budget allocation for the food ministry is also expected to increase to Rs2.20 lakh crore (inclusive of food subsidy) in the next fiscal from Rs1.96 lakh crore in this year, the sources added.The food bill is expected to rise in 2018-19 because of about 7-8% increase in the minimum support price (MSP) of rice and wheat, which are supplied to the poor at subsidised rates via ration shops.Also, the Centre has decided not to hike the issue price of wheat and rice, which at present is Rs2/kg and Rs3/kg, respectively, at least till June 2018, the sources said.The issue price is likely to be kept unchanged in 2018-19 and therefore the total food bill will increase. The government will bear the subsidy burden, the sources said.Sources also said that the focus of the food ministry in the next fiscal would be on making ration shops portable within a district initially and later within a state.This will help beneficiaries buy subsidised grain in any of the ration shop located in a district. Also, the ongoing programmes of computerising the public distribution system (PDS) will continue next year."

They alleged that at a time when farmers are resorting to distress sale of paddy due to closure of mandis following dispute over delivery of custom milled rice (CMR), the district administrations move has irked them.Instead of procuring paddy in the home district, rice millers have been allowed to purchase the produce from Malkangiri.As a result, the paddy procurement in Koraput will be delayed. While only seven lakh quintals have been procured so far, more than 10 lakh quintals are yet to be purchased from farmers.Sources said the Odisha State Civil Supply Corporation (OSCSC) had recently stopped paddy procurement for kharif marketing season abruptly over the dispute. This year, the district administration had targeted to procure 14 lakh quintals of paddy from the registered farmers through 46 mandis. Initially, 43 millers, who have delivered their CMR by September, were allowed to participate in the procurement process. They were asked to procure paddy in the ratio of 1:6 over their security deposits with the Civil Supply department.Later, 47 millers, who had failed to deliver their CMR target by September, approached the department and sought more time. Following this, the Corporation allowed the millers to deliver their rice by December and participate in the procurement process. However, the millers were asked to procure paddy in the ratio of 1:1 ratio over their security deposits with the department.Later, the department also restricted 24 millers from participation in the procurement as they failed to deliver 10 per cent of CMR against their paddy. After purchasing around 7 quintals of paddy, their targets were achieved and the corporation closed the mandis. Though the managing director of the corporation had recently visited Koraput to review the situation, the mandis are yet to be opened.Sources said after the millers of Malkangiri decided not to take part in procurement process in their own district, Koraput millers have been allowed to purchase paddy which triggered anger among the farmers.Farmers alleged that the civil supply department officials are conducting procurement according to their wishes and opposed the move of sending millers to Malkangiri district. Farmer leaders here on Sunday demanded reopening of mandis in Koraput by Monday to check distress sale."

With the roll out of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and with an eye on the upcoming state elections, the state did not introduce any new indirect taxes or levies, and the minister even shied away from hiking excise duty on alcohol, a staple measure to mop-up resources.With an allocation of Rs10,000 crore for the farm loan waiver; Rs10,000 crore for salary hikes; and Rs11,804 crore committed to local bodies as Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation  beyond its wage bill and administrative costs  the states 2018-19 budget had little scope for new initiatives.The budget, with a revenue expenditure of Rs3.01 lakh crore, tried to maintain a status quo by allocating resources to ongoing projects in its priority areas  agriculture and allied sector (Rs18,112 crore); irrigation (Rs8,685 crore); and road development and transport (Rs12,857 crore). The state evidently maintained a farmer-centric appro-ach given the agrarian crisis has been a chink in BJPs armour.The budget made provisions of Rs922 crore for subsidised wheat and rice for below poverty line (BPL) farmers in 14 districts; Rs1,500 crore for the flagship Jalyukta Shivar scheme to make villages drought free; Rs100 crore for organic farming; and Rs750 crore for agriculture pumps, among other announcements.Mungantiwar announced implementation of the 7th pay commission recommendations from this year. A move that will benefit around 18 lakh state employees, including 7 lakh pensioners.In a bid to woo the youth, the budget announced setting-up of a new skill development centre (under the new start-up policy) and district-level competitive exam centres. However, none of these measures have been backed by specific monetary allocations.Beyond this, the finance minister has used the limited elbow room he had to announce several small and big populist dole-outs to appease different communities and sections of the state.With elections expected to be held within a year, the sops include a new scheme to provide basic facilities in settlements of scheduled tribes and Neo Buddhist communities to a welfare corporation for 20 lakh auto rickshaw drivers and increasing pensions for the differently abled from Rs600 a month to Rs800-Rs1,000 a month.As a token gesture, the state also allocated Rs300 crore and Rs150 crore to the proposed Shivaji memorial in the Arabian Sea and the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar memorial at Indu Mills, respectively.Many announcements, however, were mere repetition of the policies announced earlier in the year.Despite constraints, we have increased the annual plan (development spending) by 23 per cent to Rs95,000 crore this year, said Mungantiwar. This budget has tried to chart out the states direction to a trillion-dollar economy by increasing growth in sectors like agriculture, textiles, start-ups, tourism and infrastructure. The bid is to increase our growth rate in service sector.The finance minister said that through the budget, he had tried to reach out to the disadvantageous sections of society, from tribals to the differently abled.The Opposition, meanwhile, slammed the government for making a lot of empty announcements without backing them with any allocation. This budget shows that the Fadnavis-led government in just four years has got the state to its worst-ever financial situation, said Ashok Chavan, Congress state unit chief.The revised revenue deficit for 2017-18 has been reworked from Rs4,511 crore to Rs14,843 crore. The deficit for this year is Rs15,374 crore. One can only wonder how much will the 2018-19 figure get revised to considering the entire burden of the salary hike has not been accounted for.A senior BJP minister, on the condition of anonymity, said, Within the available space, we have tried to make several constituents and constituencies happy. At the end of the day, elections are close-by. For instance, by announcing Rs2,000 crore for rural roads, most legislators in rural areas can reach out to the last-mile voter."

He has been popping painkillers for the past three nights. When asked about his injuries, Gavit gave a nonchalant shrug. This pain is much better than the threat to my livelihood. If we dont do this (participate in the farmers agitation), our next generation will suffer like us. Our income is barely Rs5,000 to Rs6,000 a month which is not enough to make both ends meet.Gavit is among 15,000-20,000 odd farmers and farm labourers from north Maharashtra who have braved scorching heat and injuries to seek attention of the government towards their demands. Among major demands of farmers is transfer of forest land they have been tilling for long, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report and widening the scope of the farm loan waiver and compensation for crop damages.The farmers started from Nashik on March 6, have travelled more than 100km and will cover another 60-70 km to reach Mumbai on Sunday.Farmers joined the protest after the Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS), the Maharashtra unit of the farmers outfit, called for the 190-km march from Nashik to Mumbai to block access to the state legislature building from Monday till their demands are met.On Friday evening, the farmers reached Valkas village near Shahapur, some 50km from Mumbai. The farmers have divided themselves into groups of 100 to 500 with vehicles carrying grains, rice and utensils. They are supposed to cook their food. A significant number of participants are members of the Left-wing ABKS. Most of them don the red Nehru caps and carry red flags with the hammer-and-sickle printed on them.Friday was the fourth day of the march. After reaching Valkas, they bathed in the Bhatsa river and gathered for dinner. It was followed by traditional songs and some even gyrated to folk music, which, to some extent, helped them overcome their fatigue.Jijabai Gaikwad, 75, from Dindori in Nashik, danced for a while despite being enervated. I dont care about my health. If I do not participate in this march, the next generation wont get what they deserve, she says.According to the Forest Act 2006, tribals are entitled to get at least 10 acres, regardless of the amount of land they have been cultivating. Most of the farmers said they were yet to get 10 acres.They alleged that government possession of forest land has turned them into farm labourers. The tiring day ended at 11pm -11.30pm as the farmers slept in the open  with a bedsheet brought from home. It was breezy near the river, but mosquitoes troubled many of them.The farmers woke up by 4am-5am and resumed their 23-km march towards Sonale near Bhiwandi. They skipped their breakfast to cover the distance on the fifth day. Jairam Pawar, one of the farmers, said, We stop twice for lunch and dinner. We dont drink tea because we consider it as a luxury.A young group was motivating farmers by shouting slogans such as It is just a kilometre away. But the heat dragged down their pace. After four-five hours, the march threaded to Sonale ground where they had their lunch, followed by the afternoon siesta. Energised, they resumed their journey for the next halt at Anand Nagar in Thane before their final destination,Vidhan Bhavan, on Monday.MNS, Shiv Sena rally behind farmersEven as the agitating farmers reached the outskirts of Mumbai on Saturday, the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) have backed the protest. The farmers, who started from Nashik on Tuesday, are camping at Mulund Octroi Naka after crossing Bhiwandi in Thane.They have covered almost 140km and will reach Somaiya Ground on Sunday before resuming the last leg to Vidhan Bhavan on Monday.MNS chief Raj Thackeray spoke to Ajit Nawale, state general secretary of ABKS, on Saturday. Thackeray said his party will support the farmers when they reach Mumbai. He may meet the protesters.On the other hand, Shiv Sena leader and public works (MSRDC) minister Eknath Shinde met the farmers at Shahpur on Friday and promised that his party will support them.Nawale said Shinde extended his partys support on behalf of its chief Uddhav Thackeray."

A number of factors like shrinking agricultural land owing to the fast paced urbanisation led to the fast fading of that exclusive variety of rice.Lack of marketing facilities and the government support such as subsidies were other factors that pushed Doon Basmati rice to the brink of extinction, Shah said.Surya Prakash Bahuguna, a rice grower, said Doon Basmati rice was also once grown in what has now developed into a massive urban area.Farming of Doon Basmati rice is now confined to a few areas that can be counted on finger tips, he explained referring to Haripur, Dhakrani, Dharmawala, Pratitpur, Ambawadi etc.Shah said not much is now known about the real variety of Doon Basmati rice which is known by its botanical term Oryza sativa Type 3.In fact, a host of other varieties of Basmati rice are sold in the name of Doon Basmati, he said, adding that it is as a very delicate variety of rice.It is endemic to the Doon valley owing to its typical agro-climatic conditions. Besides, this species of rice survives in running water only, Shah said.Then, it is an absolutely organically produced cereal which tends to lose its aroma and flavour if chemical fertilisers or pesticides are used in growing it.The study being carried out by the expert group would take into consideration all these aspects. This group will also have a representative of an organic certification agency as one of its members, Shah said.Plans were also underway to carry out Geographical Indications Registry of Doon Basmati rice, so it could be patented.We are also creating a seed bank of this exclusive variety of rice with the help of farmers who grow it, Shah said, adding robust marketing facilities would also be created.Plans were also afoot to create a gene pool of Doon Basmati rice.We will recommend that the state government also propagate this rare variety of rice in other areas of the state where agro-climatic conditions will suit it, Shah said.Bahuguna appreciated the efforts being made by the board to rejuvenate Doon Basmati rice.He, however, hoped that the move the board has initiated will be taken to its logical conclusion."
5aeabb3a9855b7179ad6e149,Birding in Basai: Are we losing the plot?,http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/sqtTH5MBqIoQfLgPqiogwK/Birding-in-Basai-Are-we-losing-the-plot.html,2018-01-12,"The Basai wetlands in Gurugram. Photo: Pankaj GuptaThe Basai wetland, an immensely popular area for migratory and common birds in Gurugram, near Delhi, is under threat. For, it has been chosen as the site for a waste-processing plant, which will not only eat into the already reduced wetland area of Basai but also disturb the fragile ecosystem.The wetland, adjacent to Basai village, is a swathe of marshy swampland dotted with submerged and floating vegetation of tall grass and reed beds. Surrounded by agricultural fields, the water levels fluctuate every season, making the wet meadows home to a variety of fish, frogs, turtles, and other insects and aquatic life forms. Most importantly, however, the wetland is a rich oasis for avian lifeattracting and hosting thousands of migratory guests from as far as Europe and Siberia. Migratory eagles, harriers, cranes, songbirds, ducks and geese, waders like sandpipers, godwits, stints, snipes and plovers mingle with local birds like herons, storks, egrets, flamingos, ibises and spoonbills.Birds of different sizes, colours and plumes in the Basai wetland have been drawing birdwatchers from the Capital and its surrounding areas for almost two decades. Some rare birds like the water rail, spotted crake, grey-headed lapwing, red-throated pipit, water pipit, bimaculated lark and smoky warbler make this place their home while escaping the harsh season of their native land.Throughout the year, especially on weekend mornings, you can spot people waiting patiently for a glimpse of rare species, or just gazing at the avian biodiversity.The Basai wetland was discovered as a birdwatching destination in 2001 when ornithologist and author Bill Harvey made a pit stop by the Basai railway track, en route to the Sultanpur National Park for a morning round of birdwatching. Harveys tale of this excellent damp and flooded grassland full of bar-headed geese, ibises, spoonbills, herons, egrets, lots of ducks and waders, eagles spread and bands of birders soon began landing at this spot. This nondescript village with rice and mustard fields transformed into a rich birding spot and a green getaway for fatigued city dwellers. A 2001 field report of the Delhi Bird Club mentions that the Basai wetland covered an area bigger than Sultanpur jheel, a landmark bird sanctuary a few kilometres further down the Gurugram-Sultanpur road.In 2004, the Basai wetland was marked as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International, a global conservation non-governmental organization, giving it the status of important habitat for conservation of bird population.Current statistics record 284 bird species in the wetland (which is equal to around 23% of bird species recorded in India and 60% of species seen in the National Capital Region), according to Ebird.org.State authorities, however, seem to be oblivious to the importance of the Basai wetland. In May, the municipal corporation of Gurugram started the construction of a waste-processing plant on these wetlands. This was met with outrage from bird lovers. The move was seen as a death knell for the birding ecosystem, especially given that the Dadri wetland in Greater Noida, near Delhi, had already been taken over for the development of townships.Even the Supreme Court questioned the Central government about whether if it was at all serious in conserving wetland ecosystems across the country.Wetlands are primarily a mix of government, private and community land, so their status when it comes to protection and preservation is rarely clear. In the case of Basai, the village has already seen the ugly side of developmentthe rural charm of paddy, wheat, millet and mustard fields replaced by intimidating housing plots, water bodies reduced by drainage, the Dwarka Expressway and a flyover over the railway crossing.Die-hard birders approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in June to salvage what little is left of the watershed. Calling it short-sightedness of the municipal corporation, the petition says, though we are not against the recycling plant, its sad that the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram has chosen a wetland for this project. The MCG claims that it is just a piece of barren land where few birds occasionally come and there would be no loss of flora or fauna by setting up the recycling plant there. The NGT heard the case on 10 January and lifted the stay on construction.It is common knowledge that urbanization is taking a toll on wetlands. But why are they so vulnerable? To some, a wetland is still a wet damp place, a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects, a veritable swamp for vector-borne diseases.Further, as demand for land takes precedence, all scientific knowledge, the goods and services provided by wetland ecosystems, is brushed aside. Its estimated that India has already lost a third of its wetlands, and otherslike Basaiare under severe stress.Experts say the new set of Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, notified in September, are a watered-down version of the 2010 rules. The 2017 rules were introduced after the Supreme Court reprimanded the Central government for not doing enough to protect or conserve ecologically important wetlands.A part of the blame also goes to scientists for failure to disseminate information on the specificity of wetland ecology. In the case of Basai, the birdwatchers could have drawn public and policy attention to the wetland when it was declared an important bird area in 2004. In 2012, when the master plan for development around Basai was drawn up by the government, these same birders could have intervened to protect the area from aggressive expansion.Today, the rain- and sewage-fed Basai wetland is still a magnet for numerous bird species. Construction work on the waste plant has been stopped since July, when the NGTs stay order was passed.A few hours of birding can still notch up to 70-100 species. On a winter morning, the cackle of migratory greylag goose is a reminder of the transience of the wetland, where construction will have commenced before the next migratory season.

Drihata Phukan, a resident of Delhi, says, We may not light a meji (bonfire) because we want to keep our Bihu celebration as eco-friendly as possible. We will light lamps instead. Also, rather than celebrating individually, we will opt for a group party, and our folk dance, Bihu dance, and play party games.Many folks like Neel Saikia are heading to Gurgaon to indulge in Bihu festivities. Saikia, a lawyer by profession, explaining why the festival is called Magh/Bhogali Bihu, says, It is called Magh because its observed in the Assamese month of Magh, and Bhogali comes from the word bhog, which means feasting.With different varieties of pithas (sweet and savoury snacks), ladoos and jolpaans (jalpaan) at the venue, the Assam Association, Gurgaon is set for Bihu. It has also arranged for a traditional meji followed by pitha-pona (rice based sweet) competition among other interesting things.These pithas, ladoos and jolpaans are shared with everyone who visits the celebration. It will continue with fun games, dance and music. The free-for-all event that has been popular among Gurgaonites since 2006 will be organised at Huda Community Centre, Sector 47, Gurgaon, today. Prabhakar Dutta, general secretary, Assam Association (Gurgaon), says, A lot of people who are not even from Assam love to participate in the festivities.Traditionally, on the eve of the Bihu, young men gather wood to construct meji and bhela-ghar (a makeshift cottage built with bamboo and dried rice stalks) in nearby fields or open areas. A community feast is then held on the Uruka eve, and dishes are prepared and feasted upon in front of the bhela-ghar. The morning after, the meji and the bhela-ghar are set on fire, and people offer prayers to the God of Fire. However, we will light meji on the Uruka eve to conclude the celebration the same day.Catch it live What: Magh BihuWhere: Huda Community center, sector 47, GurgaonWhen: January 13Timings: 6pmNearest metro station: Huda City Centre on Yellow lineFollow @htlifeandstyle for more"

It was suspected that the jailbreak  which saw Khalistan Liberation Force chief Harminder Singh alias Mintoo along with five others escape from the Punjab prison  was planned at their hideout.Last November, it came to light that three shooters, who fatally attacked gangster Devpal Rana at a Roorkee court, had been living in a rented apartment in Race Course area. Hired by another gangster Rishipal Rana, the flat was used by the shooters to plan the murder.In April, Doon was shocked when the Jharkhand police along with its Uttarakhand counterpart arrested dreaded criminal Vikram Sharma from Aman Vihar area. Wanted in many cases and carrying a reward of Rs 30,000, Sharma was hiding in Dehradun since 2012 to evade arrest.Even Shahrukh Pathan, a sharpshooter who worked for the notorious interstate Jeeva Gang, confessed to have stayed in Dehradun for about a month last year. Wanted in the murder of Haridwar-based businessman Amit Dixit in March 2017, the hardcore criminal carrying a reward of Rs 60,000 was arrested from Delhi by the Special Task Force of the Uttarakhand police in November.Former director general of police Aloke Bihari Lal said a criminal rushing away to evade arrest has two things in mind. They run away from the safest escape route and theyd like to go to a place (to hide) where theres possibility of an easy hideout.Being a gateway to the Garhwal hills and the base for hill towns like Mussoorie, Dhanaulti and Chakrata, Dehradun gets more than 20 lakh tourists annually. It is well connected with Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi by roads. The distance can be easily covered in a matter of few hours.Additional director general of police, law and order, Ashok Kumar said such criminals often take advantage of interstate boundaries as officials in other states may not know about wanted status. Likewise, criminals from here hide in other states. Moreover, it is easy for people to hide in tourist places like Dehradun which have a high floating population (almost 1 lakh).With full-fledged functioning of state-of-the-art, technology based criminal tracking network and system (CCTNS), things will become difficult for such criminals looking to enter Uttarakhand, he added.Superintendent of police (city) Pradeep Kumar Rai said the police would take action against the owner of the house (where Singh and accomplices were hiding) for not carrying out police verification of tenants. Later in the day, a challan was also slapped against the house owner under the Police Act.A hardened criminal, Harsimrandeep Singh alias Simma has a long history of crime and carried a reward of Rs 2 lakh in Punjab. He had allegedly murdered a rice mill owner in Punjabs Faridkot in July last year and confessed to having committed the crime on a Facebook post.Singh along with three other accomplices was arrested after a joint operation by the Dehradun and Punjab police from Rajendra Nagar area here late on Saturday, Dehradun senior superintendent of police Nivedita Kukreti Kumar said. A revolver and six live cartridges were confiscated from Singh, who has been allegedly involved in several cases of extortion, murder, loot at gunpoint and abduction in Punjab. He hails from Bewal Kalan village in Bajakhana area of Faridkot.His accomplices - Phoolvinder Singh from Faridkot and Ramesh Kumar and Rohit Badu from Hanumangarh (Rajasthan) - were also arrested with arms. All the accused were booked under the Arms Act. The four were produced before a court on Sunday which sent them to police custody for two days."

Except voter and MGNREGS job cards, the villagers have no basic facilities. After the district administration failed to provide the required facilities, they sought the help of Andhra Pradesh, which has set up an anganwadi centre, a school, constructed a village road and provided electricity and free monthly rice to all families.Ward member Meleka Sriram alleged that since Independence, no Government official has visited the village. While the State Government has failed to open an anganwadi centre and a primary school, job card has become useless with absence of work under MGNREGS. Villagers only enjoy their voting rights and they had last exercised their franchise in the 2014 general elections. Surprisingly, they were not allowed to cast their vote in 2017 panchayat election and their names were not found in the list.Former Langalbeda Sarpanch Purno Miniaka said he had approached the block administration several times for construction of road and provisioning of drinking water facility, but to avail. Due to Odisha Government neglect, villagers were forced to depend on the aid of Andhra Pradesh for their livelihood. The AP Government is nourishing the villagers with their ongoing welfare programmes and even opened an anganwadi centre, he said. When contacted, Koraput Sub-Collector Krutibash Rout said a team from the district headquarters will visit the village to verify the fact soon and after that, steps will be taken accordingly.Recently, Vizianagaram District Collector Vivek Yadav and former Salur MLA RP Bhanja Deo visited Tala Ganjeipadar village in Kotia panchayat where they distributed blankets and pension to 65 beneficiaries."

The reduction comes a day after the Economic Survey projected that the sector will contract 8.3% in 2017-18. The contraction was attributed to unseasonal rains, hailstorms and pest attack.The negative growth may spoil the states plan to doubling the farm income in the next five years.After announcing the loan waiver in June last year, the state government had made a budgetary allocation of Rs35,000 crore by way of supplementary demands during the monsoon and winter sessions last year.It has so far credited Rs13,782 crore into 35.68 lakh farmers bank accounts.The budget 2018-19 has also set aside more than Rs10,000 crore for loan waiver for the remaining farmers.The government, which has been talking about the sustainable development of agriculture, has introduced schemes with no financial implications.While 327 irrigation projects need more than Rs90,000 crore, the government has failed to increase allocation for them. Against last years provision of Rs8,283 crore, the 2018-19 budget has allocated Rs8,233 crore, including the provision of Rs3,115 crore for 26 projects under Prime Minister Krishi Shinchai Yojana.The budget set aside Rs1,500 crore for the Jalyukta Shivar Yojana, its ambitious water conservation scheme. The scheme targets to make 5,000 villages drought free every year. Another Rs160 crore has been provided for farm wells and ponds, and Rs432 crore for drip irrigation. Agriculture experts, however, slammed the government for flaws in implementation of schemes.There are big numbers thrown at farmers in the name of attractive schemes, but their benefits hardly reach them. They should clarify if provisions made for drip irrigation and wells are towards the dues that the government owes to farmers. The government has announced Rs 75000 crore, but is there any provision for the capital? asked farm activist Giradhar Patil.Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said that though there was a drop in the budgetary allocation, it does not include the second batch of farm loan waiver.He said that his government will ensure adequate funds for irrigation projects, besides the central aid and lending by state agencies.The Opposition criticised the state government for the inflated figures. It has been boasting of huge allocation, but it has not been able to give adequate power to agricultural pumps and minimum support price for produce, said Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, leader of opposition in the legislative assembly.The state has also provided Rs3 crore for promotion of sericulture and Rs100 crore for organic agriculture.The state has sanctioned Rs922 crore for supply of wheat and rice at Rs2 and Rs3 per kg to be distributed at 14 suicide prone districts through ration shops."

Later, the gang started spreading its tentacles.Simma has not visited his native Behbal Kalan village in the district since 2015 when he allegedly killed a close relative Beant Singh.In 2013, Ranjit Sewewala was killed by the Sewewala sarpanchs son. Later his brother Gurbaksh took over the group and avenged his brothers death by killing two members of the sarpanchs family.On June 13, 2017, the Faridkot police killed top three gangsters of the group  Karamjit Singh Dhillon, Jaspreet Singh and Nishan  in encounter.

Photo: MintBengaluru: Frequently pulled up for continuing to expand its water-intensive crops like paddy and sugarcane even after nearly four drought years, the Karnataka government is trying to strike a balance between the states acute water shortage and the aspirations of farmers by reviving old techniques of farming in paddy and sugarcane cultivation.The state government is trying to revive direct seeded rice (DSR) or direct sowing of ricea technique that requires about 30-40% less water, cost savings as well as a faster crop cyclein various parts of the state.This year will be the breakout year for DSR, said Karnataka agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda. His optimism stems from the fact that DSR cultivation of rice now accounts for almost 1.5 lakh hectares when compared to around 14 lakh hectares of total paddy cultivation in the state.According to agriculture department estimates, this year DSR cultivation could jump to three lakh hectares.Gowda said that after some resistance, progressive farmers in the state have started adopting this method, which involves direct seeding of rice into the soil as compared to raising a seed in a nursery and then replanting it on flooded fields.Farmers in the state had to wait till almost the end of July for water from reservoirs to be let into canals for lands coming under irrigation to start sowing paddy, as it involves flooding of fields from the beginning. In DSR technique, farmers can directly sow the paddy seeds into the soil after rains in June-July and wait at least 15-20 days before providing any irrigation. Then another gap of 20 days can be given before releasing more water. Only after about 50 days, you start flooding the fields, resulting in fewer plant moralities, faster crop cycle and lower water consumption, Gowda said.Initially it took us a lot of effort to convince farmers, but now they are adopting, Gowda said, adding that big farmers (who own around 50 acres) are moving towards this method and many others are following in their footsteps.So far, the government has seen farmers in the Tungabhadra command area adopt the DSR practice far more than in other parts of the state. It is now being promoted in regions around Malnad.To recover from nearly four years of drought, failing rains, historical river water disputes and only 25% irrigated area, Karnataka has also been experimenting with techniques like drip irrigation, millet cultivation and less water-intensive methods in the field of agriculture, but few farmers have shown interest in switching from paddy and sugarcane, mostly because these crops give higher yields and prices.However, farmer groups in various parts of the state continue to fight for better protection against natural and market forces from the government, rather than switching from paddy and sugarcane. Paddy has a minimum support price (MSP) and is part of the public distribution system. Even though Karnataka has been offering Rs2,300 for a quintal of ragi (finger millet)far higher than Rs1,600 for ricemany farmers have been reluctant in making the switch that has both economic and social connotations involved.The four years of drought in Karnataka saw farmer distress reach new highs with debts, loan defaults and increase in farmer suicides.Around 3,515 farmers in Karnataka have committed suicide between April 2013 and November 2017, according to data from the state agriculture department, Press Trust of India reported last month.With high investments and new campaigns for millets, organic farming and drip irrigation in sugarcane, the state government now believes that DSR could be the way forward for paddy cultivation in the state, given the response.So far it was a evolutionary growth, next year may be multiplier, Gowda said."

At Lalbagh Botanical Garden here on Sunday, hundreds of visitors got a sense of what the kite festival is like in regions of the state such as Bayalu Seema Prantha, Are Malenadu, Mumbai Karnataka, Hyderabad Karnataka, Malnad, Mysuru, Madhya Karnataka and Karavali.Hosted by the Kannada and Culture Department and the Agriculture Department for the first time in the city, the Suggi Huggi Sankranti Habba drew huge numbers to Lalbagh.While exhibits of foodgrains, sweet potato, sugarcane, avarekai (hyacinth bean) and peanuts were the mainstay in the stalls from all these regions, specific ethnic aspects like lambanis in their colourful attires with embroidered mirrors were a part of the Madhya Karnataka stall. There were also Kodava men dressed in kupya (a wrap around), a silver dagger tucked into their sash and women in their unique sarees tied in traditional Coorgi style.Women and Child Development Minister Umashree and Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda started the celebration with Rashi Pooje. From the East Gate of the garden, Sankranti Savari (bullock cart ride) was available for visitors. Drumbeats made for an exhilarating experience for children even as stalls with wooden Chennapatna toys grabbed their attention. Kite flying atop the Lalbagh Rock was a treat for families.R Krishnaprakash from Frazer Town was there with eight other family members. Because of a festival like this we can get our children and grandchildren out of the house and away from smartphones and TVs. They dont know what a harvest festival is like in villages. They havent experienced what we did as children. This should be organised in four to five corners of the city simultaneously, he said as his brother in law Krishnamurthy N S chose a Baahubali kite to fly.25,000 visit habbaAt least 25,000 people visited the habba and were given sweet and khara millet pongal by Akshayapatra and state government.Minister Byre Gowda and Sri Chanchalapathi dasa, vice chairman of Akshaya Patra Foundation, took part in preparing the dishes. The first serving was made to students from nearby government schools and orphanages.Another attraction here was Ishwar Naiks paintings made out of a jute thread.

It takes minimum of eight days to make a painting on a small greeting card sized paper, he said.Will try to host this habba every year: Minister Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda told The New Indian Express, Rituals like Kichu Haaysodu will be done in the evening. We are giving city folks an opportunity to reacquaint themselves with their traditional roots. We will try to host this every year considering its success. Asked about millets being promoted at the festival, he said, For a drought-hit state like Karnataka, millets are a climate smart crop and is drought resistant. For past 15 years, it saw a drop in production but the last year it has been good. 20 lakh hectares are used in the state to cultivate the crop. We want more people to include it in their diet as excessive dependence on rice flour is affecting their health."

While the latter gave his life for Indias freedom from the British, Prof Gurdev Singh Khush, as one of the pioneers of rice revolution, has played a stellar role in the worlds freedom from hunger.Having spent much of professional life on developing high-yielding varieties at International Rice Research Institute at Manila where his portrait adorns the main airport, Khush has won all top research awards, save the Nobel Prize.Currently, he is an adjunct professor at University of California, Davis, but his heart still beats for Punjab. On his annual outing to his home state, the 84-year-old spoke to Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak and Senior Assistant Editor Manraj Grewal Sharma on challenges facing Punjabs agriculture, and the way forward. Excerpts:How do you define the crisis in Punjabs agriculture?Misuse of our resources is the root of the crisis. We have depleting water aquifers; the soil is no longer productive. We have taken out all the organic matter from the soil, its down to 0.4% when it should be above 3%. Our nitrogen use efficiency has also gone down. Salinisation is affecting southern Punjab. Our farmers are using free electricity to pump more water than required. I spoke to Parkash Singh Badal when he was chief minister, about the need to stop free power (to farm tubewells), but he said he couldnt roll it back. Somebody has to bite the bullet and stop free electricity. Punjab farmers can afford to pay their electricity bills. In the long term, climate change will also affect Punjab adversely. The Himalayas are heating up at double the rate of the rest of India. When the glaciers start retreating, we will start losing our water resources.Why is farming no longer profitable?Our productivity is stagnating due to the improper use of water and fertilisers, while the cost of production is going up every year. Punjabs farmers are in a bind. The crop production here is comparable with other countries, but, nationally, our productivity is much lower. Even Bangladesh has better rice productivity than us.In a rather blunt message to the state, Niti Ayog has said it does not need Punjabs foodgrains for national food security, and that farmers should be encouraged to sell their crops in the open market. What are your views?This means the productivity of grains in eastern India and Madhya Pradesh is going up. The production of wheat in MP, for instance, is quite high. The demand for foodgrains is bound to fall after people reach a certain level of prosperity. People will then demand more vegetables, milk, and meat. We should start thinking of alternative crops right now, even though the switch may take several years. And we have to start reducing the area under wheat and paddy (rice).The state government incurs a bill of Rs 7,700 crore (a year) for free power. The state should not foot this bill.Can farmers be convinced to switch to other crops without an accompanying minimum support price?The solution is to grow alternative crops. If you can provide MSP for other crops, it will be good. Wheat can be replaced with mustard. We import oil worth billions. Mustard is one crop that can reduce our imports.You led international research that revolutionised the rice productivity the world over. But, ironically,rice is seen today as a villain of the piece in Punjab. Why?Yes, I have heard rice being blamed for all kinds of problems, including cancer, which is an exaggeration. But rice has caused the depletion of aquifers. We must reduce the area under rice from 3 million acres to 1.5 million acres in the next few years. North China faced the same problem, and the government finally put an end to rice production there. Soybean can be a good alternative to rice. Its an oil and protein crop, which is very productive and can yield an average of 4 tonnes an acre. I have been urging Punjab Agricultural University to breed a soybean variety that can be grown successfully in Punjab. Hybrid maize is also a good alternative as it is great feed for poultry and animals.There is an indication that the central government may completely do away with MSP. What do you think about that?If that happens, farmers will no longer be that determined to grow wheat and rice. Scrapping MSP may do some good.Why has much-talked about diversification failed to take off in Punjab?We have been hearing about diversification for several years but nothing has changed on the ground. Farmers continue to grow wheat and rice because of the MSP and high profitability. Punjabs agriculture owes its profitability to rice, and the state government gave free electricity; why would a farmer not grow rice!Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farm income by 2022. Is that possible?No, I dont think that will happen, because there are too many people dependent on agriculture and the farm sizes are too small to be profitable. The only way you can double farm income is by moving a lot of people from farms. China did that by moving farmers with 1-acre landholding to construction industry and other fields. Major investments in livestock industry can make a difference but unfortunately we cant export meat.What do you think of farm suicides?I understand these are due to farm indebtedness, and that itself is due to two reasons. One, every farmers wants to buy a tractor even if his landholding doesnt justify it. I wonder why banks give loans to such small farmers knowing that they dont need a tractor and wouldnt be able to repay the loan. Also, there is the problem of unproductive loans due to the practice of ostentatious marriages, et al.Capt Amarinder Singhs Congress government came to power on the promise of farm debt waiver. Is that a solution?They are doing this to get more votes. But where are they going to get the money for paying off this debt? I think it is not a solution but a political promise.The Centre wants Punjab to club all the subsidies and pay them directly to the bank account of individual farmer. Will that work?I dont know about other subsidies but, if this can stop free power, it will be a very important step. The state government incurs a bill of Rs 7,700 crore (a year) for free power. The state should not foot this bill. Its an unnecessary burden. No economist will agree to this. Where will be funds for any development if the government spends so much on free power? There should be meters on motors (tubewells).Coming to tech generation, public investment in agriculture research was 0.8% at the end of the 12th Plan, but it was slashed to 0.4% in 2016-2017. Whats your take?How can you double farm income without investing in research on new varieties? Then there is the national policy on not using GMO (genetically modified organism) crops even though these can improve farm productivity. But someone in the government cant make up his mind. Very senior professors in the US have written to both former PM Manmohan Singh and the present PM Modi, but to no avail. GM mustard is excellent, but the government of India has not approved it even though it imports GM canola oil from Canada.Our schools cant produce any scientists, but the government can bring about a change if it has the political will.What do you think of the role of Punjab Agricultural University in the present scenario?PAU was one of the top universities of India with very good research; but it has declined. That is very unfortunate. Two-three years ago, the V-C did not even have funds to pay the salary or pension of his employees.The share of agriculture in rural employment stands at 64%. Most farmers would like to quit given a choice. Why do Punjab youngsters want to go abroad instead of tilling the fields?Our farms are so small that our youngsters dont want to work on them. Also, there is no industry left in Punjab. Be it Jalandhar, Batala or Goraya, industry has died because the government paid no attention to it. There is a problem of quality of governance.What would be your advice to the Punjab government?I think the Punjab government has to pay proper attention to PAU and ensure better research for diversification. If you cant stop free electricity at once, do it step by step. It is very important for the future of Punjabs agriculture. The state government is doing a great disservice to Punjab farmers by giving them free power. I hope Capt Amarinder will do away with it. The government must also improve the state of schools in villages. It is pitiable. Our schools cant produce any scientists, but the government can bring about a change if it has the political will. There are two big examples of what one good leader can do. Former chief minister Partap Singh Kairon introduced murabbabandi (land consolidation), while Lachhman Singh Gill built a network of link roads. We need another Kairon or Gill to improve the state of our agriculture and schools.Why did you not join PAU as a vice-chancellor even though successive state governments approached you?I didnt think I would be able to work with the politicians here. I dont think I could work under the conditions here. Also, I enjoyed my research so much that there was no reason for me to change my course."

The proposal of the Department of Food, Supply and Consumer Affairs for providing doorstep delivery of wheat/flour, rice and sugar for eligible beneficiaries was passed at a Cabinet meeting today and will be now be sent to the Lt Governor for final nod.The meeting was attended by Delhi Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash and other officials.

I will also request the LG to consider it keeping in mind the poor residents of Delhi and pass it, Sisodia said.Theft of ration, poor quality of supplies and shops remaining closed were the major issues that residents were facing and the implementation of this new scheme would put an end to these harassments, he said. Delhi government is committed to ensure that eligible beneficiaries receive their due ration in a transparent manner with maximum ease, he said.Once approved by Lt Governor Anil Baijal, the service provider for home delivery of ration will be selected in a transparent manner through open bidding, a senior official said. The attention of the Cabinet was also drawn to the extant laws/rules and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs Government of India, asking state governments to ensure home delivery of ration to the beneficiaries experiencing difficulty in getting their entitled quantum of subsidised food grain due to old age, physical disability etc.According to a government official, there are around 72 lakh PDS beneficiaries in the city. Meanwhile, reacting to Union minister Hardeep Singh Puris remarks about the AAP government sitting on the Delhi Metro phase IV project, which is pending for the last three years, Sisodia said he has gone through the proposal.The proposal says that many of the routes are not viable and if implemented in its current form, the metro fares will have to be increased which will affect common people. We have to thus make it more practical so that daily commuters do not suffer, he said.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

(Archive) The government proposed the scheme after Aadhaar-based identification for ration caused several problems. (Archive)The Delhi government has approved the doorstep delivery of ration scheme under the public distribution system, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said.In a meeting of the Delhi Cabinet on Tuesday, a note on the issue was presented and consequently approved. It will now be sent to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal for approval, following which the scheme will be rolled out within a month, Sisodia said.The Delhi Cabinet has approved doorstep delivery of ration. Through this, beneficiaries of the scheme will get ration delivered to their homes, he said.Earlier this month, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia had alleged that a ration mafia was trying to stop the scheme. While the CM had alleged that certain officers were in a nexus with the ration mafia, Sisodia attacked the L-G, asking why he was protecting black marketeers.The scheme will focus on wheat, rice and sugar for eligible beneficiaries of targeted public distribution system under the National Food Security Act 2013, the government said in a statement, adding that it was aimed at reforming the targeted PDS in public interest.The statement added, The attention of the Cabinet was also drawn to the extant laws/rules and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, asking state governments to ensure home delivery of ration to beneficiaries experiencing difficulty in getting their entitled quantum of subsidised foodgrain due to old age, physical disability, etc.Outlining the reasons for the scheme, Sisodia said that Aadhaar-based identification of ration holders had led to teething problems and unforeseen trouble. These problems will be solved the problem of finding ration shops closed will stop. People will have the option of telling what time they want the ration delivered, he said.He added that the ration will be delivered in sealed packets, thus weeding out the problem of theft and adulteration. We will also have a system to address grievances in case of complaints, the deputy CM said.Stating that efforts were made to stop the pro-people scheme, Sisodia said, Now that it has been passed by the Cabinet, I would appeal to the L-G to pass the scheme since it is related to poor peoples food. This will stop ration theft and I would hope that this isnt stopped after comments from officers After it is passed, we will ask for tenders within a month. However, a section of officers at the Food and Civil Supplies department spoke of potential problems with the scheme, claiming that it did not appear to be well thought out.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

The primary school at Baligeda village under Budaguda gram panchayat in Daringibadi block of Kandhamal district is a glaring example.As many as 33 students are enrolled in Classes I to V of the school which lacks a building of its own. As per reports, a building for the school was constructed more than two decades ago. However, the building gradually got damaged due to lack of maintenance and repair and subsequently, collapsed around five years back.On the other hand, lack of a building has not deterred teachers from discharging their duties. The two teachers of the school use verandas of different houses in the village to take classes. Touched by their sincerity, villagers repaired a cowshed and handed it over to the school authorities for conducting classes. For more than a year, the school has been functioning in the cowshed.School headmaster Prahalad Kumar Sahu said, We have never neglected our duties and also not allowed students to suffer due to lack of classrooms. Though the authorities concerned have been apprised of the sorry state of affairs in the school, no action has been taken.Bhagabati Prasad Sabat, a local, said when there are no classrooms, getting a place to store rice and other commodities for Mid-Day Meals (MDM) is a distant dream. While the MDM is being cooked in the open, students are served their lunch outdoors. This apart, as water from the lone tube-well in the village emanates foul smell, the students are unwilling to use it. Instead, they collect water from an open pit which makes them vulnerable to various diseases.Villagers alleged that funds for construction of classrooms should have been released had the spot earmarked for the school building not set aside for setting up a community toilet. They further said despite repeated missives, no official or even the elected representatives have cared to visit the village."

It was found that the millers had stocked crops in excess of targeted procurement.Earlier, farmers had alleged before the district administration that the millers engaged at the mandis used to cut down up to 1 kg of paddy per quintal for fair average quality (FAQ) testing while buying the produce from them during the procurement. Acting on the allegations, Collector K Sudarshan Chakravarthy had formed a squad to conduct raids on the rice mills across the district. Recently, the team also conducted raids on 21 rice mills across the district.Farmers leaders alleged that the paddy growers in the district have incurred losses due to the nexus between unscrupulous officials of the civil supplies department and millers. Most of the millers have stored excess paddy procured illegally from the mandis. But the team could not unearth it as the millers were informed about the raid by some civil supply officials, they said.When contacted, District Civil Supply Officer Abhimanyu Mohanty said the team is yet to submit the report of seizure.The exact amount of excess paddy seized from the millers will be known after the report is submitted. These 11 millers are not in a position to maintain the stock register, while the LAMPS, which purchased paddy and handed it over to millers, have not submitted acceptance note. An additional procurement target of 2,58,000 quintals has been fixed after achieving the initial target of 5,52,000 quintals of paddy. So far, 5,97,000 quintals have already been procured, he added.Meanwhile, locals and some farmers organisations have urged the Collector to reconstitute the squad alleging that some officials of civil supply department are having nexus with the millers. They demanded surprise raids on the rice mills."

State Food Corporation (SFC) was tasked to procure around 1.55 lakh MT from North Chotanapur and Santhal Pargana, while FCI had to procure about 30,000 MT from Palamu division. The FCI hired NCML for procuring around 2.15 lakh MT paddy from South Chotanagpur and Kolhan divisions.In a move aimed at benefitting farmers, the state government granted bonus of Rs 150 per quintal to farmers on MSP. The Central government hiked the MSP of paddy to Rs 1,550 per quintal for 2017-18 from Rs 1,470 in 2016-17. With Rs 150 bonus, a farmer in Jharkhand is getting Rs 1,700 per quintal for paddy procurement this year.The department registered over 1.11 lakh farmers this year to provide them hassle free and cashless procurement service. Under the new system, farmers get SMSes mentioning the scheduled date and centre of procurement.Sources in the department said farmers received good money from private parties also this year. The private party offered Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,650 per quintal paddy to farmers. This was one of the major reasons for poor procurement, said an official, who wished not to be quoted.State food and public distribution minister Saryu Roy held a meeting with department officials and district supply officers (DSO) here on Thursday and asked them to expedite the procurement process.Complaints about poor procurement, delays in SMS sending and payment are coming from areas where SFC has been engaged to procure paddy. We had blacklisted NACOF agency for these reasons last year. The same mistake is being repeated by the SFC now, Roy said during the meeting.The minister also warned the NCML to improve paddy supply from farmers place to rice mill in a week. Otherwise, we will blacklist the agency, the minister said.Roy also directed the official to immediately release payments against paddy procurement to farmers."

The change resulted in a spike in gold imports. In the six months between June 1 and November 30, 2014, gold imports rose to 553 tonnes. Of these imports, almost 60% was accounted for by 13 PTHs and STHs.Traders hoarded the metal, benefiting from lower import prices. The May 21, 2014 notification of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) making the change overturned an August 14, 2013 notification by RBI that disallowed STHs, PTHs, and units in SEZs from importing gold to sell in the domestic market. The only entities allowed to do so were banks and a few other agencies (and these were further required to ensure that 20% of their imports were re-exported). The objective of the August notification was to restrict import of gold for use in the domestic market, and, thereby, contain Indias swelling current account deficit.The Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association cried foul at the change in policy which, it alleged in a July 26, 2014 letter to the RBI, helped only large private trading houses and conglomerates, many of which had no history of gold imports, and were not interested in promoting the jewellery business. (They) do not have a mechanism to ensure the end use of gold sold, the letter said  as 20% would have to be re-exported  and they are engaged in circular/fictitious export.The NDA subsequently (towards the end of 2014) scrapped the August, 2014 change.The 13 trading houses that increased their imports during the period for which the scheme was active are: Rajesh Exports, MD Overseas, Kundan Rice Mills, Kanak Exports, Edelweiss Commodities, Zaveri & Co, Riddhi Siddhi Bullions, Khandwala Enterprise, Jindal Dyechem, Gopal Jewels, Reliance Industries, Gitanjali Gems, and Su-Raj Diamonds."

However, unlike a few other athletes who might have had to face a similar situation, Thingalayas issue wasnt the severe cold thats crippled most parts of the United Kingdom. Its just that he got his visa on the very day of his travel, the uncertainty even ruling out chances of his coach travelling with him. However, had he not received his visa in time, India would have gone unrepresented at the Championships.The federation had to speak with the IAAF in the last minute. I mean, had it gone later by a day, I dont think I wouldve got the visa. I reached here on March 1. An athlete needs to reach before anyone since he needs to get acclimatised to the conditions, get used to the track and mentally prepare with whats going around you, the track commotion, etc. But I cant blame anyone, he said, shortly after going through his warm-up routines, here at the Arena Birmingham on Friday.READ | Shubhankar Sharma upstages big names to take lead in WGC-Mexico ChampionshipThe 27-year-old will take part in the 60m hurdles at the Championships and will want to eclipse his national record of 7.7s in order to bag a medal. However, given the kind of schedule he has been following ever since touching down, getting his composure back would be on the top of his priority list. I was hungry as I didnt have any meal pass since I came in so late and thus I couldnt get inside the dining hall. I didnt want to go out as well since it was snowing. So I was eagerly waiting to go out and have breakfast. I was hoping someone could manage a little bit for me, he added.By his own admission, this is the first time that Thingalaya has witnessed snowfall. This is the first time Im seeing snow. I might go to Dubai or somewhere its warm if I need to train, which is why I like California, he said, while quipping about the drastically different conditions back in Mumbai where his family stays. I saw the climate, I knew it was going to snow, but again it would have been better had I come in here a little earlier. As soon as this race gets over, I have to head to Patiala and take part in the nationals, since its compulsory for every athlete to compete.But hows the feeling coming down here for the first time? He hardly stays in Mumbai, trains in California and like every other Indian is a foodie. If the first two could still be dealt with, the third part is the most challenging part for Thingalaya. Admitting that he needs to shed at least 5kg for the outdoor season, the lone Indian athlete is yet to try out the various Indian restaurants in Birmingham, which are in fact, quite close to the hotel hes put up at.READ | When all five athletes of a 400m race got disqualified at World Indoor ChampionshipsI have to lose around like 5kg for the outdoor season. I genuinely want to eat Indian food, but I cant. I have a lot of organic stuff, he added. I love vada pav (a popular Indian snack). Ill eat one once my season ends I guess. But my favourite is daal (split grain) and rice and Mangalorean fish fry. Definitely Im going to have them once my season ends. Being a Mumbaikar, one vada pav per season is quite some resistance!Like his love for vada pav, Thingalayas journey, too, started back in Mumbai albeit as a football player until his coach urged him to increase his speed.I started as a football player. I used to be a midfielder for which you require a lot of speed and you have to work for it. So my coach back then advised me to join a summer camp at the Andheri Sports Complex, he said. Thats where I started to work on my speed. But I stuck to that (sprinting) mostly because of two reasons  I started to win all the inter-school competitions, which made you pretty famous back in school because the announcements are made and secondly, soccer is a team game and this was more individualistic in nature where Im responsible for every single aspect.READ | IAAF World Indoor Championships: Danil Lysenko, Mariya Latiskene bag gold on Day 1While that did bring him close to his current discipline, it was still quite a bit far from it. His inspiration to become a hurdler? An unknown Parsi veteran. I once saw someone hurdling at the Priyadarshini Park. He was a veteran Parsi guy and it looked so attractive, I wanted to imitate him and check if I could do it, Thingalaya added. I had zero technique when I went to the state-level. I would do everything starting from jumping to sprinting and so on... I used to wear football shorts and slippers to these meets. I didnt care about anything. I didnt win the first time I participated at the state-level. But then it was also the first time I was exposed to failureThere wasnt much expertise to back him up as well. With his former trainer being a cricket coach, he didnt know much about hurdle techniques. There were spells where he admits he learnt about them by reading up from books. An impressive showing at the 2010 Commonwealth Games did attract a few sponsors but by 2015 he was all on his own once again. With no coach for Saturdays event as well, Thingalaya will have to challenge for the medal as an individual unit once again.The motivation? The main goal is to have a better timing. I have the basic speed. The only thing is that I need to run like Im running for my life.NOTE | The reporter is in Birmingham as part of the Young Reporters programme organised by AIPS in collaboration with the IAAF"

He points to his field, which had once won him the badge of a successful farmer from the Bihar government. He had grown a record 492 quintals of rice in one acre, in 1977.But for this man, who resettled at Biranchi tola number 3 colony -- one among 46 other East Pakistani Hindu refugee colonies in west Champaram -- life is not the same. A flooded Manihari river left piles of sand on his farm and destroyed his fields and his pride. Havildar, who made his way here in 1956, is a broken man after losing four acres of land which are either filled with sand or have been eroded by the river. Nobody from the government has come here. I am virtually landless, he says.Havildar is not alone. Shyamal Prasad Saha (70) and nonagenarian Rabindra Nath Poddar too lost huge chunks of land to sand, making them virtually landless. Saha, one of the educated Bengali refugees grew rice, wheat and sugarcane in the four acres of land he got from the government as part of the rehabilitation policy. He has now shifted base to one of the refugee colonies situated in Bettiah town.Poddar, who earned name and fame for his treatment of snake bites, lives with his extended family. Nearly 55 families out of 113 families rehabilitated in Biranchi no 3 in 1956, have lost nearly 121 acres of agricultural and 69 decimals of housing land. They now live on the edge of poverty.Land for settlementMany Bengali speaking Hindus were forced to leave East Pakistan and take shelter in India.The Centre arranged for their rehabilitation in West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar, Assam and Tripura.In Bihar, these Bengali speaking refugees were first set up in a camp near Paschim Hazari area. They were then relocated to the 46 refugee colonies spread across West Champaran. Bihar has 115 refugee colonies. West Champaran has the maximum, followed by 38 in Purnia and 13 in East Champaran.Each of the displaced families were given two types of land -- five acres for farming and 18 decimal to build a house, or four acres and 18 decimal land. They were given voting rights only two years back in 2015.Not all refugees were lucky. Nearly 24 families  14 of whom are from Myanmar and living at Paschim Hazari camp set up in 1956  are still to get any land. It is not the issue of citizenship. They all have voting rights, said Dr (Capt) Dilip Kumar Sinha, former vice-president of Bihar Minority Commission and president of Bihar-Bengali Samiti. He did not address the issue of non-allocation of land.We never visited our relatives who stayed back. But nobody cares for our plight, said Girija Lal Sahu, a refugee, who came to Hazari camp in 1974. Sahu makes do plying a rickshaw. Other refugees left out in land settlement either work in fields as daily wagers or are into petty business.While some still do fight for land, at Majaharia, another refugee colony, situated near the Udaipur ox-bow lake, encroachment of their land by locals resulted in a bloody fight in 1997.Caste RecognitionIn a state where caste plays a major role, these Bengali speaking people are also vying for a caste identity.Raja Kumar Das, a student of class 10 at Swatantra Senani Kedarnath Motani High School, has been trying to get a caste certificate to apply for his board examinations for the last eight months.The Bihar School Examination Board has announced the schedule, but Das is still struggling to get the caste certificate that is mandatory.It has been proved that more than 65% of them belong to Scheduled Castes (SC) but they are shown in the list of backward castes and extremely backward caste list in Bihar. This is making it difficult for them to get caste certificates. This deprives them of different welfare projects of government, said Madan Banik, vice president (zone 4), central committee, Bihar Bengali Association.A study conducted by Asian Development Research Institutes Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance (CEPPF) reveals that 36.2% people fail to find their caste in the state list, whereas 66% have been placed in extremely backward class. The survey reveals that 97.1% people claimed themselves to be SC, of which 49% and 38% are in East and West Champaran districts respectively.The same people find place in SC list in neighbouring West Bengal. Does change of place change the caste also? wondered Banik.This has happened despite the state general administration department issuing instructions (letter no 20810, dated 16.6.2009) to district authorities to issue caste certificate.The associations Bettiah chapter president, Radhakant Debnath, had written a letter in October 2017 to the district magistrate to consider the state directive, but has not had a response.Socio-Economic ConditionsThe CEPPF study reveals that only 16.2% Bengali speaking refugees have passed matric or taken to higher education; 11.2% refugees can read in their mother tongue Bengali with difficulty, while just 23.6% can write in Bengali.The economic condition of these refugees has not changed either with only 3.3% of their population in government services.While 43.7% are wage labourers, 28.7% are self-employed, mostly in agriculture. More than half their population, 56.6% have shown their income below Rs 3000 per month. Over 30% of the population does not have ration cards and only 15.2% have concrete shelter.The demand for the formation of a Refugee Development Authority is long pending. In 2011, Bihar government announced the constitution of Tharu Development Authority for the development of Tharus living near the borders with Nepal and gave them the status of scheduled tribes. The Bengali Association has also demanded that they be included. The government has, however, been found lacking."

(Representational) Meanwhile, with increasing awareness about the dangers of chemical colours, stores selling organic colours in the city have seen a significant rise in demand. (Representational)With the festival of colours approaching, organic colours are flooding the market and a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Thane is boosting an eco-friendly Holi by helping children make their own natural and organic colours.Members of the Paryavaran Dakshta Mandal have been conducting workshops for schoolchildren for over a month now. We use ingredients available in almost all households. Whatever is unavailable can be procured, sometimes without spending money, explained an NGO member, Hemangi Sawant.Turmeric powder, flowers of marigold and flame of the forest, raw waste of beetroot and spinach and kattha used in paan are used as ingredients to obtain colour pigments. For dry colours, we mix the shade-dried and finely crushed ingredients with rice flour. For instantly-made wet colour, we just crush the dried ingredients and mix them with water, Sawant said. These methods are being taught to schoolchildren across Kalyan, Dombivali and Thane.According to another member of the NGO, Nishtha Raut, The steps are easy and even parents or elder siblings of small children can help. Within minutes, the colours are ready.The NGO, according to Sawant, has been holding similar workshops for the past 18 years. However, now when we approach schools, they are more receptive; the children understand the importance of organic colours more (these days), said another member of the NGO Rupali Shaiwale.She added, Children generally dont have access to these organic colours. But now, they are aware of the issue. Meanwhile, with increasing awareness about the dangers of chemical colours, stores selling organic colours in the city have seen a significant rise in demand. Suriti, the culture shop in Powai, has been selling organic colours for the last eight years and has seen the demand considerably increasing every year. We started by selling around 50 boxes of our five-colour package but last year, the number increased to 150 boxes. This year, we are left with only 10 per cent of the stock. Families now prefer to buy organic colours for their children as they know it to be safer, said a supervisor of the store.Hina Chokshi, who has been selling eco-colours for the last decade, says she had also noticed a similar trend. The colours are derived from natural products like turmeric, beetroot and indigo. Chokshi gets the colour processed from parts of Vidarbha and Ganeshpuri in a bid to ensure rural economy benefits from it. The products have to be dried in an open area and then ground and powdered. I get them done in the rural areas as they have more space and the farmers also get additional income, said Chokshi.According to Chokshi, people are also ordering organic colours for weddings and birthday parties. We have received orders for birthday and wedding parties as they were falling on Holi. Schools have also ordered them to ensure the kids play an eco-friendly Holi, she said.These colours are more expensive than chemical colours but are preferred for their safety. As compared to chemical colours, which are harmful for the skin, these (organic colours) are good for the skin. They are also easy to wash off and do not leave behind marks. Since they are made of natural products they are safe for kids. Also when the (organic) coloured water flows into the soil it will act as a manure and not pollute it, Chokshi explained.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and officers of the departments of agriculture and finance who met Kumar sought Niti Aayogs intervention for a package to the states peasantry.When we raised the issue of farming crisis, the Aayog members told us we could look beyond the wheat-paddy cycle of food security. The message is clear: state must not depend on Centre alone, and can take steps it deems necessary on its own, said an agriculture department officer who was in the meeting but not authorised to speak to the media, adding, Farmers are ready for the challenge.Rajiv Kumar later said, We discussed high-priority areas for Punjab in the agriculture sector. Farmers here need to cut down on input cost and grow high-value crops. We are working on an action plan for the state. I have asked for discussions from the state.Manpreet was more upfront at the press briefing: In the name of national food security, Punjab should not be victimised. Our farmers are in crisis; the soil and aquifers are exhausted.This shift of focus is an indirect way to telling Punjab that we dont need your grain. To to fill the gap, eastern states are coming up in a big way.  Sardara Singh Johl, farm economistPunjab has for five decades been contributing majorly to the national food bowl. While the figure once stood at 60% of the countrys rice (paddy) and nearly 80% of the wheat, in the 2016-17 season the state contributed 29% of the rice and 38% of the wheat.This, when Punjab is 2.4% of the countrys area, and has just 0.7% of the countrys farmers. The farmers are in a debt crisis, though. As per figures quoted by different agencies, including the state government, total debt on the states peasantry is Rs 90,000 crore, while overall debt on the nations farmers is estimated at Rs 11 lakh crore.Punjabs farmers are dependent on the minimum support price (MSP) offered by the Centre on wheat and paddy. But the farmers and the state government have been seeking MSP as per the Swaminathan formula: 50% profit over input cost, including family labour cost and lands potential revenue. For now, land potential is not taken into account while calculating input cost, even though the Centre says it will follow the 50% formula.Centre should procure directlyThe visiting team of Niti Aayog was also told that Punjabs government loses Rs 1,800 crore every year in procurement of wheat and paddy. We offered that they (Centre) should take charge of procurement, and it be done by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), said Manpreet.Six state-owned procurement agencies procure wheat and paddy on behalf of the Centre using cash credit limit sanctioned by the Union ministry of finance through Reserve Bank of India. These agencies pass on the foodgrains to the FCI for distribution to other states too.The state government in 2016 owned up Rs 31,000 crore as term loan for 20 years  this figure was actually the difference between CCL funds received and the grains procured. Every month, the state repays Rs 270 crore thus.Speaking on other issues discussed, Manpreet said Niti Aayog was asked to take up flood-control measures on the border with Pakistan. The members, according to the FM, were also urged to frame policies keeping needs of Punjab in view .The issues, as per a government release, included funds for Stage 2 of Shahpur Kandi Dam project and lining of the Sirhind canal and Rajasthan feeder. Also, the state sought increase in Centres contribution to 90%, from the current 60%, to the border area development fund.Hidden message?Asked about the issue, farm economist Sardara Singh Johl said, This shift of focus is an indirect way to telling Punjab that we dont need your grain. To to fill the gap, eastern states are coming up in a big way.He lamented, Despite alerts to successive governments in Punjab not to depend on MSP of wheat and paddy, and to grow other crops, the situation has been allowed to reach this level."

Anil Kumar (43), who runs an FPS in Sarai Kale Khan, said, The raise is helpful, to some extent it will help us cover our expenditure, rent, wages.However, Kunj Bihari Bansal (54), who runs an FPS in Gautam Nagar, said, Its not enough, rents are very high in the city and we have to pay wages to one labourer who weighs the ration.

He said UP was a rich state with poor people because of the lack of vision for development and hoped the state would achieve heights of development under the leadership of its chief minister, Yogi Adtyanath.Gadkari said his ministry was ready to help UP in all possible ways, provided land was made available for the road projects. You provide us land and we will not let you down, he said pointing to minister for industrial development, Satish Mahana on the dais.The minister said Lucknow-Kanpur travel time would be reduced to just 40 minutes on the completion of the expressway connecting the two cities. Work on the proposed expressway, he said, would begin with bhoomi poojan in April. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would inaugurate the Delhi-Meerut expressway next month.However, Gadkaris emphasis was more on the development of waterways which, he claimed, could be a game-changer for UP. The ongoing Rs 54,000-crore Varanasi-Haldia waterways project will transform UPs economy, he claimed.He said the under-construction multi-modal terminal at Varanasi would emerge as a major logistics gateway connecting north India to eastern and north-eastern states.By the 2019 Kumbh, people will be able to travel between Varanasi-and Allahabad by the Ganga waterway, he said, adding that a new law would be made within the next three months to facilitate the plying of sea planes in the country.Gadkari said this sector had immense potential in UP and called on the state government to work on the promotion of second generation ethanol (made from bagasse, rice straw etc) and use of the same as a cheaper fuel for vehicles. With 125 sugar factories, UP has a lot of potential of producing ethanol fuel, he said, adding This will create a lot of employment as well in rural areas.He said the ambitious Ken-Betwa river interlinking project will project UP in a big way by irrigating 4.50 lakh hectare land in Bundelkhand region. The minister said Rs 28,000 crore would be spent on the project in UP alone.Earlier, potential investors gave presentations on the possibilities of development in UP. Minister of industrial development Satish Mahana assured entrepreneurs of all government help, if they invested in the state. With long-term planning, we will make UP as one of the most preferred states, he said.Gadkari said 4,000-km new roads will be made in UP under the Bharatmala project, the Centres flagship scheme for highway construction. He said detailed projects reports (DPRs) for Rs 900 crore had also been cleared."

By March 15, the botanists aim to scan more than 25,000 specimens and will send the digital images to the BSI.The BSI mooted the proposal in 2013 and it took them more than five years to ink the deal. The pioneer flora institute has plans to send 12 more botanists to London so that the scanning can be completed within a year to streamline the database, Singh said.The Portuguese introduced potato and tomato to India, he said.Being a staple food item in India, there is a need to identify the species that belong to the family, he said.We know of kand-mool, which has reference in historical transcripts but it was replaced by potato and tomato.The specimens at the London museum will help us to identify alternates of the two crops so that we can harvest the plants as well.Botanists are also scanning plant species from neighbouring countries, including Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar and this will help in understanding the genesis of different plant species."

Since the machine arrived, Aggarwal said business has been down by 25% as old customers go to other FPS if their biometrics dont match in one go.The Indian Express visited FPS across Delhi over a span of five weeks and found that in several cases, the machines were faulty, network connectivity was low, and fingerprint recognition of the elderly was problematic.At shops The Indian Express visited in January and February, many left without their allocated kilos of wheat and rice.The linkage of Aadhaar with ration cards has led to a larger scale of exclusion. Many homeless and transgender people dont have Aadhaar cards and cant get ration. The last time ration cards were made in Delhi was in 2013. No ration card quotas have been opened since then. Despite the linkage, the corruption continues. Aadhaar cant be a tool to fight corruption; maybe it can be one for identification. What we need is a robust grievance redressal system, where a time-frame for correcting issues should be provided, said Anjali Bhardwaj, co-convener of the National Campaign for Peoples Right to Information.In January, Delhis Food Supplies Minister Imran Hussain had told The Indian Express that iris recognition will be implemented from January 15, and authentication using one-time password (OTP) will be done at FPS between January 15-20.Yamuna Das (52), who runs an FPS in Madanpur Khadar, has no idea when the iris and OTP facilities will be made available.It would help to have alternatives. This e-PoS machine doesnt catch any signal here; I have been complaining since day one. I bought an Airtel 4G hotspot for Rs 1,500. The battery is terrible and the charger doesnt work. Its as if the government didnt assess the challenges and just handed over an incomplete plan to us, Das said.He recounted an instance of an old man, who came to his shop a few days ago. He was the sole card holder in his family But the machine didnt recognise his biometrics. We tried all 10 fingers. I had to give him ration manually, I had no option.Moolchand Gupta (55), who sells wheat and rice at his convenience store in Safdarjung Enclaves Krishna Nagar, said he has to shut shop every time the e-PoS machine fails. Its a loss of not just ration sale, but everything else too. The machine is creating trouble again, I dread going to get it fixed at ITO, said Gupta, whos been in this business since 1981. For more than a month now, he has been using his neighbours WiFi to make the machine work.The Delhi government, meanwhile, is keen on doorstep delivery of ration. A senior official at the Food and Supplies department said, If this is worked out and passed, it will become much easier to monitor distribution. Ration cards have been linked to Aadhaar cards in the city. If ration does not reach a person, they can complain immediately. Text messages will be sent a day before the ration is to reach them for better information and monitoring, he said.However, Saurabh Gupta, secretary of the Sarkari Ration Dealer Sangh (Delhi), said: Customers can sample the quality of wheat and rice at an FPS; they cant do that at home. Also, the government spent a lot of money in setting up these machines, it is an utter loss if they resort to home delivery.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

Dhawan averages 71.33 in England and 52.83 in South Africa. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli has a 50-plus average in Australia, South Africa and England. Dhawan averages 71.33 in England and 52.83 in South Africa. (Source: AP)After leading South Africa out of a 22-year isolation from international cricket, an emotional Clive Rice summed up the feeling thus: I know how Neil Armstrong felt like when he landed on the moon.Nearly 27 years later, after leading India to their maiden ODI series win in South Africa, Virat Kohli wouldnt sound entirely hyperbolic or unbefetting if he were to reproduce Rices metaphor when he clutches the glittering trophy in Centurion on Friday, after the inconsequential sixth match of the series. For the wait for the historic triumph, as his predecessors would testify, has been agonisingly interminable, so much so that there were times when it seemed that such a moment of triumphalism as this would never arrive so soon or so emphatically. Say what you will of South Africas defected batting line-up, the injured luminaries, the un-tuned bowlers, or the sub-continentality of some of the surfaces, circumstantial evidences vindicate that Indias victory was not an accident of circumstance or a generous winking of good fortune.Rather theyve been staggeringly ruthless in knocking their opponents down on the mat and flawlessly clinical in twisting the knife between the ribs.Instructive in this regard is the gnawing margin of victoriesby six wickets, by nine wickets and nearly 30 overs in the bank, by 124 runs and by 73 runs. Fortune alone cant win you matches so consistently authoritative, especially at that neck of the woods where only Australia have pocketed a five-or-more-match bilateral series (twice) in the last 26 years, where Indias own record is not a flash (a win-loss record of 19-5 before this series).In any case, a 4-1 scoreline doesnt exaggerate the merit of the victorious, as much as it doesnt hide the deficiencies of the vanquished. Rather it attests to a genuine starburst of white-ball brio of this Indian side. While it may not, on paper, have covered all the bases to be called a world-beating side, it surely is one of the most dynamic Indian sides abroad, a team without any corseted inhibitions, a bunch that knows how to get its business done.Among the most eulogised are the two wrist spinners, Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, who among them have nabbed 30 wickets, a tally unmatched by any Indian spinning pair in a bilateral series outside Asia.But South Africa coach Ottis Gibson believes they will be tamed by the time the World Cup comes whistling to England, where he also believes that they wouldnt be able to purchase turn as much they did on the uncharacteristic ones in South Africa. Rather, he sees the quality of Indias top three as a more dangerous portent, and a prima facie difference between his and Ravi Shastris side. In almost every game, one of their top three has scored a hundred. Weve got one hundred and when you look at the series those are the differences, he had said.The tally of four hundreds by the top three is the most Indian batsmen have managed in South Africa in a single series. Its the same number they have collectively managed in 27 matches before this series.The trio of Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have already put to shade some of the countrys most destructive batsmen. Sachin Tendulkar scored a lone hundred here, aggregating a cringe-worthy 25.13. Virender Sehwags highest was 34, his seven innings breeding only 105 runs at 15.Yuvraj Singh too was wretched, his 11 outings begetting him only 150 runs. Among the lot, only Rahul Dravid (51.20) and Sourav Ganguly (43.44) found a measure of the surfaces and bowlers.Its paradoxical that their Test numbers here were middling, 29.71 and 36.14 respectively, similar to those of Dhawan and Rohit. It was literally against the same group of bowlers  Morne Morkel, Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi  that they once looked bedevilled, and now bull-dozing.In blue flannels, they have resembled jackrabbits bounding out of their boroughs, finding a vengeful range and rhythm. If the short balls wound up Dhawan in Tests, here he was cutting and pulling with carefree insouciance. Rohit, prone to fatal stabs outside the off-stump, is creaming and caressing the same deliveries to the fence.Men for all conditionsBut it shouldnt surprise us, because the openers have been profoundly consistent abroad, be it South Africa, England or Australia, three most difficult places to be openers irrespective of the format, they have emerged out of the burning crucible unscathed and their reputation enhanced.They are denied of their dues because often their ODI productivity is entwined with their storied Test maladies.Their numbers outside Asia verify as muchRohit averages 45.38, the corresponding numbers of Dhawan and Kohli are 45.19 and 55.29, respectively. Kohli averages 50-plus in all countries barring West Indies (45.46). Dhawan boasts 71 in England, 52.83 in South Africa and 42.93 in Australia.Rohit has already racked up more than 1,000 runs in Australia (1143 at 51.95, 805 of those coming against the hosts), brags an average of 53.30 in England and seems more controlled than ever before in South Africa. Understandably, all three have featured prominently in Indias enduring moments overseas in recent times, especially in global events like the Champions Trophy and World Cup, making them again a feared troika in the World Cup next year.And conversely, India have withered away when all three have flopped, the most memorable case in point being the Champions Trophy final last year. Suffice to say they are a condition-and-pressure-proof trinity. While Kohli always was considered one, from the time he eviscerated a primeful Lasith Malinga in Hobart, its high time Rohit and Dhawan be inculcated into the bracket.Its tempting to call them the new fab three if not the best top-three in the world currently, better even than the Warner-Finch-Smith axis in terms of consistency and condition taming. The series-win in South Africa, thus, is their collective Armstrongean moment.Above averageWhile Dhawan and Kohli have a terrific record overseas, Rohit is an aberration only in South AfricaIn AustraliaDhawan: 644 runs at 42.93; Centuries 2Rohit: 1143 runs at 51.95; Centuries 4Kohli: 1001 run at 50.05; Centuries 4In EnglandDhawan: 865 at 71.33; Centuries 3Rohit: 533 runs at 53.30; Centuries 1Kohli: 682 runs at 52.46; Centuries 1In South AfricaDhawan: 317 at 52.83; Centuries 1Rohit: 241 runs at 20.08; Centuries 1Kohli: 748 runs at 74.80; Centuries 26TH ODI: LIVE ON Sony Ten 1 & HD: 4:30 PM onwardsFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

REUTERSIn his Iron Man helmet and red racing suit, South Korean Yun Sung-bin has seen off rival riders in high-tech skinsuits, led his heats in the mens skeleton and emerged as the one of the host countrys favourite athletes at the Winter Olympics. South Korean crowds have flocked to watch the 23-year-old at the Pyeongchang Olympics in his bid to win his countrys first skeleton medal, preferably gold. They have not been disappointed.Yun set a track record during his second heat on Thursday, hours after his teams head said Yun knew the curves of the Olympic sliding centre better than anyone. The way people ride skeleton is similar to the way Iron Man flies, Yun said, speaking to Reuters after setting the record. Hes also my favourite character, and thats why I wear him on my helmet.Yun topped Thursdays heats amid ongoing grumbling from fellow athletes that the British riders high-tech skinsuits are an unfair advantage.British skeleton racers have said the teams equipment had been checked and signed off by tournament organisers. Still, the skinsuits were not enough to pip Iron Man, with Britons Dom Parsons fourth and Jerry Rice in 12th.My coach said they had changed their suits, but I dont know much about that, said Yun.SLIPPERS TO SUPERHEROYuns rise to South Koreas sliding superhero has been as fast as his times on the track. At high school, a teacher recommended him as a slider to the deputy head of the Seoul Bobsleigh Skeleton Association, Kang Kwang-bae.

5aead7159855b73f522c3e30,India's Farmers Need a New Deal beyond Cliched MSP Politics,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-farmers-need-a-new-deal-beyond-cliched-msp-politics/story-fpGg1pb90g1IKOkWBTUN3O.html,2018-02-15,"Finance minister Arun Jaitleys grand budget announcement of Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) providing assured 50% return to farmers may not actually mean a 50% return. The government admitted on February 9 that it had the so-called A2+FL (a measure of variable costs) and not C2 (which also includes fixed costs) costs in mind while calculating return mark-ups vis--vis MSPs. An earlier HT story had pointed this on February 7.Now that the buzz around budget seems to have settled, a deeper question can be asked. How much of a role can MSPs, and promises of increasing them, play in addressing the growing viability crisis of agriculture in todays age? Beginning with some stylised facts may help.Less than one-fourth of Indias total cereal production is procured at MSP. The share of procurement is slightly higher, a little less than one-third, for wheat and rice (Chart 1). Of late horticultural production has surpassed food grain production in India. There is no MSP coverage for fruits and vegetables.Even the limited procurement which happens is extremely skewed. More than half of total rice and wheat procurement is done from the traditional green revolution states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (Chart 2).A National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report for 2012-13 shows that less than half of all farmers were even aware about MSPs. The figures vary across crops. Only a fraction of those who are aware about MSPs actually sell their crops to procurement agencies. Such sale is able to dispose off only a fraction of their total production (See Chart 3).These statistics provide a context to the twin challenges of putting into place a holistic and remunerative MSP policy. If MSPs have to be really remunerative, they need a significant hike compared to present levels. An even bigger problem is the skewed crop-wise and state-wise coverage under the procurement net. If this has to be increased significantly, it would require a massive scaling up of governments procurement operations. This is not just a question of money. Storage of procured food grains is a big problem even at current procurement levels.The only effective way to dispose procured grains is through public distribution system (PDS). This avenue would come under squeeze as cash transfers replace distribution of food in the PDS.Both the present and past government has been pushing for abolition of in-kind food security programmes. Politicians, who wax eloquent about the benefits of doing away with in-kind PDS hardly talk about the effect it would have on procurement operations. Wider MSP coverage and cash transfers in food security programmes cannot go hand in hand in India.The problem does not end here. It is a fact that more and more Indians are getting out of abject poverty. They are also becoming more and more mobile in search of jobs. The middle classes do not need the PDS to buy food grains and other essentials anymore. Scarcity of such things is not something post-reform India would even relate to. Growth in agricultural production is the biggest reason for this.Both these developments reduce the possibilities of a healthy growth in number of people using the old arrangement of ration shops to access subsidised grains. This means even without cash transfers, the ability of MSP- type policies to support farm incomes will shrink in days to come.All this is not to say MSP-based PDS is not needed anymore. Starvation deaths have been reported because people could not get their ration due to Aadhaar-related problems. The absolute number of very poor people is still very high. MSP-based procurement is an important anchor of agricultural prices in India. It also protects countrys food security. Many farmers could switch from food crops to commercial crops if there were no procurement.What all this does suggest is the fact that agricultural policy making has got itself into a cul-de-sac. The tested method of incentivising agricultural production  MSP-based procurement  is reaching its limits. Uncertainty in farm incomes is only increasing with growing weight of perishables in total agricultural production. Challenges such as climate change related adverse effects on farm production would be here much sooner. Farmers are feeling the pinch of all this, but they have no agency. Farmer politicians do not hold much clout in Indias game of thrones.Those who do not earn their living from farming are not bothered for the moment. Indias urban middle class probably never had it so good when it comes to consumption of food products. A large variety of food items are being delivered to their doorsteps at discounted rates. The more farmers incomes are squeezed, the cheaper they get these things. Although much smaller in number than farmers, this class exercises a disproportionate sway in opinion building.The political class has by and large chickened out from handling this fundamental political economy divide. Its happy to placate one class at a time. Lower inflation for large part of the term, followed by a tactical MSP hike towards the end.The consequences can be disastrous in the not-too-distant future. A deep rooted crisis in farming can end the supply glut largely taken for granted. Signs of growing social unrest are already visible. Any new deal to farmers would require resolution of this contradiction rather than fraudulent promises of MSP hikes."
5aead72d9855b73f522c3e45,India's Agricultural Focus Must Shift to Environmentally Sustainable Crops,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-s-agricultural-focus-must-shift-to-environmentally-sustainable-crops/story-xmuoDJJjphINcEyrk7B11H.html,2018-02-15,"Indias agri-exports potential is as high as $100 billion against current exports of $ 30 billion, said finance minister Arun Jaitley in this years budget speech. He also said that the government will further liberalise agricultural exports to achieve this potential. Most people will welcome such statements.Exports can be a big opportunity to enhance farm incomes in India. Indias agricultural trade regime is often accused of having a pro-consumer bias. When prices increase, export restrictions and lower import duties are used to control inflation. Domestic consumers gain but the farmer loses out on gaining from these cyclical movements. There is no bailout for the farmer when prices crash in domestic markets.There are good reasons why a liberalised export push in agriculture might not be an unambiguous good. These are related with issues of long-term sustainability in agriculture and domestic food security concerns.What is the biggest component of Indias agricultural exports? Spices, tea, cotton etc.all come to mind. The correct answer, however, is rice. Between 2006-07 and 2016-17, rice alone accounted for around 17% of the total value of Indias agricultural exports. More than half of our rice exports are of the basmati variety. Many farmers and exporters must have gained from the sharp rise in Indias rice exports.These exports, however, entail a huge cost for the environment. Rice production uses a lot of water. In a 2016 Mint article, I used data from the Water Footprint Network  a global network on water related issues  to estimate that 10 trillion litres of water went into the production of Indias basmati exports in 2014-15. The story also pointed out that India was among the largest virtual exporters of water via agricultural exports.Depleting water tables due to excessive use of ground water is a major concern vis--vis the sustainability of farming in India. Exporting more and more basmati rice without thinking of its environmental repercussions is not going to help matters. It would only hasten the destruction of agricultural ecosystems.Agricultural production in India needs to change drastically if we want to prevent irreparable damage to our environment. A policy which only looks to maximise exports would not take us very far in achieving this. We need to come up with incentives which reward our farmers for shifting to producing environment-friendly crops, even if they do not get us more in export earnings.An environment-friendly readjusting of Indias agricultural production need not necessarily be contradictory with farm incomes. India imports a large amount of pulses currently. The latest available data for past three years (2014-15 to 2016-17) shows that the value of Indias pulse imports is more than half of total rice exports from India. Why cant we encourage farmers to switch to pulse cultivation from rice? Unlike rice, pulse cultivation can improve soil health, as pulses help in increasing nitrogen content, which is a crucial soil nutrient.Indias agricultural production basket is extremely diverse. Given this fact, the pursuit of self-sufficiency in agriculture is not necessarily a bad thing. Not only would this save us valuable foreign exchange, it can also protect our farmers from the price volatility in international markets. Such an approach can also help us safeguard our food security interests.The complete liberalisation of agricultural trade can make our domestic food production vulnerable to cheaper imports from highly subsidised production in developed countries. Indias policy makers are aware of this threat, which is why they are insisting for a permanent solution on the issue of public stockholding and special safeguard mechanisms in the World Trade Organisation.There can be no disagreement about the fact that agricultural incomes have to be increased in India. The challenge would remain even if a significant part of agricultural workers move out of farming. What many people do not realise is the fact that leaving everything to the markets can be counter-productive in agriculture. Current farming decisions and practices are crucial for future sustainability. Markets, especially in foreign trade, are not the best way to send the right signals to adhere to these concerns. A smart country would encourage its farmers to cultivate environmental-friendly crops and import the environmentally-damaging ones. The farmer cannot be expected to act with foresight in such matters. This increases the role of futuristic policy making even more.@roshanjnu"
