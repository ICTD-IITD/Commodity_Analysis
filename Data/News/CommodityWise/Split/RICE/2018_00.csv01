The trick is based on the fact that human body starts getting affected by a fire at 800 degrees Celsius while inflammable products, such as kerosene oil, burn at temperatures below 400 degrees Celsius. So, the person applies kerosene oil at specific points of their body and move the fire from one point to another. The trick is to hold the fire for less than a second at one place so that there is no repercussion on the body, Brahm Prakash, a former member of Haryana Vigyan Manch, who was invited for the show, said.Another famous trick which was debunked by Prakash was creating fire from coconut shells.Often, you see tantric babas put bhaboot (holy powder) in a coconut shell, after which a fire erupts and then he uses it to scare off ghosts in a person. The real trick here is that sodium metal is kept in the coconut and the result of the reaction between sodium and moisture is fire. Therefore, these babas use moisture on sodium to create fire, Prakash said.He also debunked the trick in which tantricks are seen conjuring bhaboot out of thin air. You must have seen that tantric babas chant some mantras and they conjure bhaboot out of thin air. Actually, they store small capsules in their hand, which are filled with talcum powder, rice starch, dry cow dung and other ingredients. It is just a trick of hand to hold the capsule neatly and burst it to create bhaboot, Prakash said.As many as 300 children and 50 teachers of various government primary schools of Jewar attended the science show.It is a good initiative by the science club to debunk these myths with the use of scientific explanations, Sunil Dutta, primary education officer, Jewar, Gautam Budh Nagar, said."

(Express photo: Ojaswa Thapliyal) At a ration shop in Madanpur Khadar. (Express photo: Ojaswa Thapliyal)More than a month after Aadhaar card-based electronic Point of Sale (e-PoS) devices were set up in 2,254 Fair Price Shops (FPS), a number of problems continue to plague the system. Apart from faulty machines and low network connectivity, the iris authentication machines  which were to be functional January 15 onwards  still havent been delivered at several FPS in the city.At Madanpur Khadar, an irate Yamuna Das (55), who runs an FPS, said, Iris machines havent been given to us yet, we dont know when to expect it either. The two SIM cards in the e-PoS machines dont work I bought a 4G hotspot for Rs 1,500 to make the machine work.In the queue stood Basanti Devi (70) with her son Rohit Kumar (36), who said, I had to take a leave from my job as a tailor to stand in this queue. We cant do this every month my salary gets cut and I am the only earning member of my family.At FPS, wheat is sold for Rs 2/kg, and rice for Rs 3/kg. The e-PoS device comes equipped with two SIM cards, and the fingerprints authenticate the card-holders. Last month, Delhi Food Supplies Minister Imran Hussain had told The Indian Express that iris recognition will be implemented on January 15, while authentication using one-time password (OTP) will be done at the FPS between January 15-20.At another FPS in Humayunpur, Moolchand Gupta (55) showed an extension cord that the engineers fixed for the iris machine a week ago but the machine is still not here. He said, It would help to have an alternative, the e-PoS machine takes 30 minutes per person. There is no network here.According to Gupta, before e-PoS, he would sell ration to 60-70 people daily, and now, its down to 15-20 people daily.A similar extension cord for iris authentication machine was fixed at Kunj Bihari Bansals FPS in Gautam Nagar. The Aadhaar-enabled PDS website shows numbers that indicate ration has been given to almost everyone and that the e-PoS has been successful, but its only because we are all using our own WiFi or phone hotspots. We were told that iris machines would be here by January 15, then February 6 but its not here yet. We hope it is better than this machine, said Bansal, who is also the vice-president of Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh.Asked about iris authentication machines and linkage of Aadhaar Cards with ration cards, a Delhi government spokesperson said, There are definite problems in linking Aadhaar Cards to ration cards. The government is working on providing alternatives one was home delivery of ration but objections were raised. A big decision is expected soon.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

A case has been registered against total eight people in the scam.The accused who were authorized to use E-FPS application provided by the government for issuing subsidised items to beneficiaries by matching their stored biometric details with barcoded ration card and UID (Aadhar), used illegal software and somehow accessed the data built by the government. This way they diverted the quantum in name of unsuspecting beneficiaries, who were not utilising their allotted quota, said the Crime Branch of Surat police in a press statement.The police said that a probe was on to find out how the government data was accessed and how the unauthorised software worked.The beneficiary had to provide his finger print, details of his ration card and UID (Aadhaar) numbers to match the data fed into the computerThe police investigation is also seeking to find out the exact quantum of wheat, sugar and rice which were supposed to go to beneficiaries of Annupurna Yojna was withdrawn and where it was diverted.The matter came to light when some of beneficiaries found that items in their name was issued though they had not utilized their allotted quotas. They made representation to the Surat district collectorate which asked the police to investigate the matter.In April 2016, the state government had launched the Annapurna Yojana under the National Food Security Act -2013. Fair price shops, which have been renamed as Pandit Deendayal grahak bhandar, were computerised so that subsidised food items reached the actual beneficiaries.While Gujarat has barcoded ration card and issue of subsidised item works by using UID and customers end, the fair price shop owners have been given a username and password to access the biometric data bank of beneficiaries to create an electronic record of beneficiaries availing subsidised grains from their shops.The customer provides finger print, details of his ration card and UID (Aadhaar) numbers to match the data fed into the computer. This generates a slip on the basis of which subsidised items are given every month.Police said that the two men have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including section 406, 409 (criminal breach of trust), 467, 468, 471 (forgery), as well as sections of the Information Technology Act and the Essential Commodities Act."

Ahead of the judgment, the two states are tense with anticipation and apprehension as it will impact the fortunes of millions of farmers on either side.Passions are running high. In poll-bound Karnataka, the Congress-led government can ill-afford to upset farmers now and in neighbouring Tamil Nadu, the Opposition is mounting a frontal attack on a wobbly AIADMK government.It is in this scenario that Tamil Nadu chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami last month sought an audience with his Karnataka counterpart Siddaramaiah to urge him to release 80 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of Cauvery water that was due to Tamil Nadu, as per the final award of the Cauvery River Water Disputes Tribunal.Citing poor storage in its reservoirs and its own irrigation requirements and the drinking water needs of an expanding Bangaluru, Karnataka has allegedly defied the Supreme Court order and refused to release water.The farmers in the Cauvery delta farming fields here were hoping for a good crop this year after six successive drought years, who desperately need water to save the standing Samba crops (rice grown between August and January), may once again be disappointed.Siddaramaiah appears to be playing for time and is unlikely to meet EPS before the Supreme Court verdict  citing his preoccupation with state budget slated for February 16.There will be no meeting before the verdict. We are expecting 470 tmcft of water for Karnataka in the final award as against the 270 tmcft given by the tribunal, says Brajesh Kallappa, the Congress spokesperson from Karnataka.Karnataka water resources minister MB Patil told mediapersons that Karnataka was not in a position to release any more Cauvery water. Tamil Nadu had already received 113 tmcft so far, which was more than what is stipulated under a distress formula, he added.Experts say it is not without reason that Tamil Nadu farmers see Karnataka as the villain.They say that Karnataka has built new dams and reservoirs, de-silted its water bodies and canals and with a political unity of purpose was better prepared for the battle.Tamil Nadu farmers are crying hoarse for 15 tmcft of water to save the standing samba crop, but the state government is in a bind given the precariously low storage level in the Mettur dam. Thats one reason why chief minister EPS has lobbed the ball in Karnatakas court, but the Opposition in Tamil Nadu is not impressed.The DMKs working president MK Stalin said the state government should have forced Karnataka through the Centre by taking an all-party delegation to Delhi.MDMK leader Vaiko charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi with treating Karnataka with kid gloves as he was eyeing votes to capture Karnataka that goes to polls in two months.What to speak of irrigation, people will not even have drinking water, Vaiko said, painting a dismal picture.While politicians on either side whip up emotions, some counsel negotiated settlement  farmer to farmer meetings to thrash out a solution in a true give and take spirit.Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, a farmer leader from southern Karnataka, blamed the politicians for the mess, saying, If farmers on both sides sit down, a solution can be found without any trouble.Chandrashekhar said that governments were responsible for the spate of suicides by farmers in both states. Industrialists are helped, but not farmers, he rued.Like Chandrashekhar, S Ranganathan, the 82-year-old general secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association and the original petitioner for setting up a Cauvery tribunal in the Supreme Court, calls for a dialogue as well.He says nearly 80% of the crops in Cauvery delta need water for three more wettings or they will die before being harvested.Ranganathan says the Cauvery delta is among the most efficient rice-producing fields in the world and it would be better to save Tamil Nadus status as the rice granary of south India, just as it must be ensured that Bengaluru thrived as the IT powerhouse of the country. Karnatakas dry weather and soil quality would be better suited to millets rather than water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane, he adds.Despite these arguments, battle lines are drawn ahead of the verdict. Karnatakas Mandya region, the epicentre of violent protests by farmers and pro-Kannada groups in 2016, is already tense. The state police has stepped up security in the region."

Petr Cech has not practised but I will not take any risk if he is not 100 percent fit.Wenger also hopes to have Nacho Monreal and Danny Welbeck available for the game.The game is the first time Wenger has taken Arsenal to play Spurs at Wembley, a ground where the Gunners traditionally thrive, winning the FA Cup final in 2014, 2015 and 2017.We feel we have a good level of performance at Wembley, but it will all come down to the day, said Wenger.What Wembley gives you is a good pitch to allow you to play the way you want to play.Arsenal go into the game in sixth place, four points behind Spurs and five off a Champions League qualifying spot.I know the importance of this game and it is a chance to close in on a Champions League spot. We are behind in the table and have to catch up, said Wenger, who will face Spurs for the 52nd time in his 22 years as Arsenal manager.There is always huge passion. I worked with Pat Rice for many years and he quickly got me on that territory.It is always a game more charged emotionally for everyone but this season for us it is a very important game in terms of the table.The players know how important it is and you have to find a balance between being rational and emotional.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

Then, did the dramatic farmer protests with tonsured heads and human skulls in Delhi, led by P Ayyakannu, exaggerate farm distress?A local farmer cautioned the untrained eye, The greenery can be fleeting.At the moment, farmers are hoping the rain god is kind and Karnataka fair. For the first time in six years, a section of farmers in the Cauvery delta comprising Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and parts of Tiruchirapalli are beginning to smell success after a favourable northeast monsoon.Now, they are desperate for water from Mettur dam, but the Tamil Nadu government is unable to oblige due to acute shortage. Chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami has sought time from his Karnataka counterpart, Siddaramaiah, to urge him to release Cauvery water to save the standing crop.Deekshita Balasubramaniam, a prosperous landlord who owns farmland spanning 400 acres at Kallanai in Tiruchirapalli, has suffered extensive losses in the years gone by and is hoping to harvest a profit this time.I could withstand (the losses) because I own two colleges and other businesses. But for many, successive crop failures on account of water shortage due to drought and Karnatakas refusal to part with Cauvery water have meant collapse, said Balasubramaniam, the Tiruchirapalli district president of Cauvery Delta Farmers Association.Delta farmers need a few more wettings of their standing crop before they harvest. If they dont get water, it will be another year of loss.NC Kannan, 42, who has a three-acre farm in Thirumalam village located barely 7 km from Bay of Bengal, has fingers crossed. Every year in the past six years, I lost Rs 1.5 lakh. All because of Karnataka, he said. Farmers across the region take the same line.P Sivagnanabharathi, 56, who has a two-acre farm at Irandamsetti village on the outskirts of Mannargudi, said, Karnataka will not accept the Supreme Court verdict, like it ignored recent orders to release water to Tamil Nadu. Sivagnanabharathi, who is also a state government employee, added, Even if the SC verdict favours Tamil Nadu, Karnataka will never implement it. With elections in Karnataka, we will become victims again.T Madan, 26, working on his farmland at Pirinjimulai village near Thalainayar town, said, Of course, Karnataka will dare the SC again and refuse to accept any order that asks it to give water. Madan, who is pursuing a PhD, added, Has anyone been able to force Karnataka to give water as per SC order? Unfortunately, politicians in TN are not united as they are in Karnataka when crucial issues come up. We have been left to the mercy of God and Karnataka.Jeeva Kumar, a farmer welfare activist and CPI(M) member, said, In the last six years, Tamil Nadu government has not convened a single all-party meeting on the issue, nor sent one delegation to the President, the Prime Minister and authorities concerned.S Ranganathan, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, said, Karnataka has spent more money in desilting its lakes, ponds, canals and rivers, built more dams, whereas in Tamil Nadu, it seems the government and politicians are only interested in sand mining. Ranganathan, whose petition led to the legal battle between the two states on Cauvery water sharing, added, Rivers have become a source of money for politicians  so they want rivers without water.Incidentally, Ranganathan is a part of Cauvery Family, a group of farmers from both states who have met for years to find an amicable solution to the water dispute without recourse to courts.He believes it is possible. Leave it to farmers of both states. They will settle it, said Ranganathan. So why havent they been able to resolve the differences? Politicians have spoiled it, he added."

At present, 23 crops are backed by MSP although only some of them, such as rice and wheat, are efficiently procured.I am confident that this historic decision will prove an important step towards doubling the income of our farmers, the finance minister said.Jaitley also proposed to raise food subsidy by 21% or ~29,041 crore to ~1.69 trillion for 2018-19. While the fertilizer subsidy was raised marginally in the next fiscal year from the revised estimate for the current year, the petroleum subsidy estimate has been kept unchanged at over ~24,000 crore.NR Bhanumurthy, professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said the decision to widen the ambit of MSP will have an inflationary effect on food prices and a partial effect on retail inflation. That, however, will not result in a deviation from the inflation target range of 2-6%, said Bhanumurthy.Jaitley downplayed the potential impact on inflation. We dont see any serious impact on inflation with these measures. Theres nothing in the budget that will make prices go up."

It is one of several steps initiated by the Centre to realise Prime Minister Narendra Modis vision to develop Uttarakhand as an organic state so that local farmers income could be doubled by 2022, Uniyal said.Modi had made an announcement to this effect while laying foundation stone for the Kedarnath reconstruction projects last year.Uniyal said funds have started flowing in to pave the way to give a fillip to organic farming even as the state government had initiated steps to legalise the alternative agricultural system.In that connection, we will soon introduce two dedicated laws, he said adding the Organic Agriculture Bill and the Nursery Management Bill would be enacted in the assemblys budget session that would commence by March end.The Organic Agriculture Bill, once enacted, would provide legal backing to the governments initiatives aimed at developing the hill region as a full-fledged organic state. It would be mandatory for private parties, who would be roped in to provide plants and seeds to farmers, to register themselves under the proposed law, said Uniyal adding, the rule would ban the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides in areas selected for organic farming.Besides, the proposed law would have strict provisions for penalising those who would be caught using chemical fertilizers or insecticides while growing organic crop of any kind. Besides, under that law, it would be mandatory for farmers to get their products certified by the designated agencies, he said. The provisions would also be applicable to the agencies that provide plants and seeds etc to farmers or those (agencies) that undertake value addition of organic farm produce.All such legal measures would help establish our agricultural produce as a distinct brand. That will help us achieve our objective to establish the mountain state as an exporter of organic produce internationally, Uniyal said. Export of organic produce will fetch huge foreign exchange hugely benefiting our farmers doubling their income by 2022 in keeping with the Prime Ministers vision.Similarly, the proposed Nursery Management Bill would also have strict provisions. Once this bill is enacted, those who dupe farmers by supplying substandard saplings or seeds will be severely penalized, he said adding, the government had already declared 10 blocks as fully organic.Other 10,000 organic clusters would be developed under the Prampara Krishi Vikas Yojna, a centrally-funded scheme. This project will be implemented in a five lakh acre area and will boost the income of five lakh farmers. Under this scheme, separate clusters of organic seeds, vegetables, fruits of different kinds, varieties of agricultural crops including Basmati rice besides those of herbs and medicinal plants would be developed. Besides, plans were afoot to develop 500 clusters of high density apples. Our aim is to be at par with neighbouring Himachal Pradesh in apple production, Uniyal said.Besides, the state government would soon introduce a project under which an Integrated Model of Agriculture Village would be developed. Under that project, each cluster would be equipped with facilities such as cold storage and sorting-grading units etc. These clusters will also be equipped with farm machinery banks so that farmers can use state-of-the-art farm equipment to enhance the agricultural productivity, Uniyal said."

Agriculture minister P Srinivasa Reddy worked in a cotton ginning mill and raised Rs 8.5 lakh and home minister Nayini Narasimha Reddy worked as a salesman for a few minutes at a saree shop in the city to earn Rs 29.52 lakh.Similarly, excise minister T Padma Rao earned a whopping Rs 38.50 lakh by selling fish in a local fish market in Secunderabad. Finance minister Etela Rajender earned Rs 11 lakh by carrying a rice bag in a rice mill and health minister Dr Lakshma Reddy collected Rs 5 lakh for checking a patients blood pressure in a corporate hospital in Hyderabad.Deputy chief minister Kadiyam Srihari taught in three schools and collected Rs 5 lakh while another deputy chief minister Mohammad Mahmud Ali worked at a car showroom in Hyderabad for 10 minutes and pocketed Rs 9.60 lakh.Several other ministers, MLAs and other party leaders also raised a huge amount as funds for the party plenary."

""They had no clue.""The little-known crater, barely a four-hour drive from the western city of Jeddah, is a remnant of volcanic activity -- local folklore, however, has it as having been formed when two mountains were so passionately in love that one uprooted itself to unite with the other, leaving a bowl-shaped depression in its place.In recent months, authorities have built roads and markers to the site and erected picnic shelters around the rim of the crater.""The key challenge is to make such tourism sites accessible,"" said Khalifa, adding that he only had one camping group at the site that weekend.- 'Big treasure' -Tourism is one of the centrepieces of Vision 2030, the blueprint to prepare the biggest Arab economy for the post-oil era, which was conceived by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.In August the kingdom announced a multi-million dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.It also plans to develop historic sites such as the centuries-old Mada'in Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra.The kingdom aims to nearly double the annual number of tourists it attracts to 30 million by 2030, with the sector projected to become one of its top revenue earners.Tourism chief Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz told AFP last month that preparations were afoot to launch electronic visas in the first quarter of 2018 to ""all nationals whose countries allow their citizens to visit"" the Gulf state.""The kingdom is a very big treasure,"" Prince Sultan said, describing its stunning landscapes. ""We're not just oil traders.""In an effort to change perceptions, Saudi Arabia has relaxed some of its most rigid rules -- lifting a cinema ban, allowing gender-mixed sporting events and announcing that women will be allowed to drive from next June.But its absolute ban on alcohol still makes it a hard sell for many global tourists, experts say.Rumours have swirled about plans to create exclusive resorts for foreign tourists, which, similar to many expat compounds in Riyadh, would have more relaxed norms.But Prince Sultan said the kingdom, home to Islam's holiest sites, would not permit alcohol as ""we do not want to give up our culture and our local values"".""Given the sensitivities of opening up to large numbers of non-Muslim tourists, I'd expect the authorities to focus more on encouraging local and regional visitors in the first instance, while the tourist infrastructure is developed,"" said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in the United States.""And then cautiously start to market the kingdom to the wider world.""- 'Travel breaks down barriers' -But global travel agencies such as Britain-based Steppes Travel are already planning to offer packaged tours.""There is a lot of potential for Saudi tourism -- we know this not least from the pent-up demand we have within our own database,"" Justin Wateridge, managing director of Steppes Travel, told AFP.""There is interest in those that know and understand Saudi Arabia and not much needs to change other than the issuing of tourist visas. Travel breaks down barriers and prejudice.""Tourism is still a ""new concept"" for Saudi Arabia, said Khaled Batarfi, a Jeddah-based writer.""Serving others in our tribal heritage is unacceptable, except your own guest,"" he wrote in the Saudi Gazette newspaper, calling for the need for professional training.Back at Al Wahbah, that seems to be changing.When the hiking group emerged from the crater, guide Khalifa swung open the boot of his SUV to remove tents, folding chairs, firewood and platters of meat to set up camp near the rim.""When Saudis go camping they take their full house with them,"" he said as the group settled in for the chilly night.""That needs to change."""
5aeaf0409855b73f522c4fe4,MP's Bhavantar Policy for Farmers Set to Become a National Template,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-s-bhavantar-policy-for-farmers-set-to-become-a-national-template/story-Ngbx1QRH2W3NiHXvZt9hvL.html,2018-01-24,"Madhya Pradesh is experimenting with a scheme to directly pay the states farmers for market losses in eight notified commodities, mainly oilseeds and pulses, a policy thats never been tried before in the country.Its an attempt to intervene in markets, which are mostly opaque, when rates for farm produce fall below federally set floor prices.The scheme could be a template for a larger national programme for two reasons. It can stem politically damaging rural anger when markets crash. At the same time, it can be far less expensive for the state than the other available option: procurement. The challenge is to ensure scheming traders dont benefit from it at the cost of farmers.The Mukhya Mantri Bhavantar (literally deficit price) Bhugtaan Yojana or chief ministers deficit-price payment scheme, rolled out in October 2017, marks a new shift in the way the government rescues farmers.Under current policy, the central government sets minimum support prices or MSPs  supposed to act as a floor price to avoid distress sales  for 23 crops but it largely benefits only wheat and rice growers because only these commodities are procured by the government on a large scale at the set price.Broken markets, layers of intermediaries and colluding traders often mean farmers face volatile swings in prices. Currently, they are getting negative returns in many crops, according to Ashok Gulati and Siraj Hussain, who are Infosys chair professor and senior fellow respectively at the New Delhi-based think-tank Icrier.Their calculations show that for summer-sown crops in 2017, net margins for farmers were -30.6% for urad (black gram), -13% for maize, -25.7% for arhar (pigeon pea), -13.7% in soyabean, -4.6% in groundnuts and -0.10% in cotton.The Bhavantar scheme Direct cash transfers to farmers for market lossesCould be replicated nationally to curb rural dissentGovernment fills gap between federally-fixed prices and market rates for select cropsMP government paid Rs 140 crore in the first cycle (Oct 16-31, 2017)In the second cycle (November 1-30), Rs 746 crore was paidScheme currently covers oilseeds and pulsesThe margins were calculated by subtracting the market price from the projected C2 costs as a percentage of C2 costs. C2 costs, as defined by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, denote expenses such seeds, fertilizers, machinery, labour, working capital as well as opportunity costs such as imputed rental value of land and family labour.Bhavantar operates at two levels. For fair and average quality produce, it seeks to pay farmers the difference between MSP and the modal price prevailing in three states. Modal prices are a kind of derived average prices.For produce thats below fair and average quality or slightly inferior, the government pays only the gap between modal prices, not MSP, and the actual prices received by farmers.In a country that spends more on farm subsidies than capital investments in agriculture, the price-deficiency payment scheme will add to government costs, but help farmers in times of distress.The policy was first advocated by Ramesh Chand, the head of agriculture at the state-run Niti Aayog think-tank, as a solution to collapsing prices.India imports oilseeds worth Rs 70,000 crore and pulses worth Rs 18,000 crore. We are running this scheme on a pilot basis to offer profitable prices for these crops, says Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary in the states agriculture department.Policymakers are smart, but profiteering traders can be smarter. Since the state was anyway paying for farmers losses due to lower prices, evidence shows traders in Madhya Pradesh colluded to suppress prices further.In the last week of October 2017, the first month of the schemes rollout, prices of urad beans in the Bhopal market fell to Rs 1,500-1,750 a quintal, 67% lower than the MSP of Rs 5,400 per quintal. The average prices in neighouring Rajasthan were Rs 3,500-Rs 3,800 a quintal, raising the suspicion of a price-lowering cartel in Madhya Pradesh.Moreover, there were reports of farm produce being re-sold to traders in fake transactions. State agriculture minister Gaurishankar Bishen played down such possibilities.Small incidents may have taken place of say 10 quintals. Even that could not have happened without farmers colluding with traders. But we are plugging loopholes as we learn.When the government buys wheat or rice, it spends significant amounts in economic costs, or the cost for transporting and storing the produce. Bhavantar works out cheaper. Rajora recently made a presentation before the Union agriculture ministry to show the extent of savings vis--vis MSP-driven procurement.For example, according to the presentation, the costs of procuring 128 lakh quintals (each quintal is 100 kg) of soyabean that arrived until January 1 in MP at an MSP of Rs 3,050 per quintal, would have cost Rs 3,198.49 crore.Under the Bhavantar scheme, paying the difference between MSP and average prices for the same quantity worked out to just Rs 424.61 crore, which is just 10.84% of the procurement cost.Of the 60 lakh-odd farmers, nearly 22.1 lakh farmers have enrolled for the Bhavantar scheme. Even among those who enrolled, farmers who actually chose to avail of it are fewer in number, pointing to logistical hurdles. In Indore district, only about 20-22% farmers registered for it, says Renu Parashar, the schemes nodal officer for the region.For instance, of the 17.71 lakh tonnes of total urad output in MP, 8.1 lakh tonne or just 45.75% was registered under Bhavantar. Of this, farmers actually chose to claim benefits for 8.1 lakh tonne, or 70%.Rajora, the official manning the scheme, says since the quantity of produce for which payouts were made is less than the total produce, there was no possibility of largescale fudging in transactions, as alleged.So far, Rs 140 crore had been paid for the first phase of the scheme (Oct16-Oct 31), while Rs 746 crore was paid in the second phase (1 Nov-30 Nov).Rajora has made three recommendations to the Centre to strengthen the scheme in case its adopted nationally. One, to discourage poor quality crops, he said, anything sold at less than 50% of the MSP should not qualify for the scheme. Two, strategies should be made to ensure that the difference betweenMSP and modal prices shouldnt be large. Third, the entire transaction between the trader and farmers should be digital.Its a good scheme but how long these things are sustainable, I dont know. In the long run, its important to address imperfections in the market by reforming them, says Pravesh Sharma, former agriculture secretary of the state.Even if it succeeds, the scheme may not benefit vegetable farmers since determining a national benchmark price for horticulture produce is tough. For six years in a row, Indias horticulture output has outstripped foodgrains. In 2016-17, horticulture production stood at 283 million tonnes, compared to 273 million tonnes of foodgrains. Thats a huge market to take care of."

Putting the Kerala Government in a tight spot, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has come out with an analysis saying that LWE violence is taking place only in Kerala and not in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Though the three states- Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu (KKT) form the tri-junction where Maoists have been establishing their strong presence, no LWE violence was reported in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu while 23 incidents were reported in Kerala between 2014 and 2017.The report on LWE violence in KKT was submitted by Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Hansraj Gangaram Ahir in a written reply to a question raised by Kodikunnil Suresh in Parliament.As per the MHA, while no violence was reported in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu since 2014, violence data for Kerala was 2014 - eight, 2015  ten, 2016  five, 2017 - 0 (upto 15-12-2017).The MHAs assessment of the LWE violence in Kerala cannot be taken lightly by the Kerala Government as the state has been witnessing heightened activities of the banned CPI (Maoists) in the past two years.We dont want to comment on LWE violence data of the Union Government. But we have been taking necessary steps which included strengthening the combing operations to flush out Maoists holed up in forest regions in Wayanad, Kozhikode and Kannur, said Kannur Range Inspector General Mahipal Yadav. Another senior police officer said: we have launched a detailed probe after armed suspected Maoists visited a house at Kodencherry in Kozhikode last week and took away all the rice from the house.Though the LDF Government led by the CPM took the offensive against LWEs to a new level by engaging in an encounter with Maoists in Nilambur forest range in November 2016, which resulted in the death of two Maoist leaders, the government was forced to soften its stand after the CPI, the second major constituent in the LDF Ministry and other social activists came out against the offensive operation. A social collective organised a public function in Wayanad to commemorate the two martyred Maoist leaders - Kuppu Devaraj and Ajitha- while the CPI in its Kozhikode district conference presented a resolution commemorating the two leaders."

Lets banish old ways and keep our minds open to previous possibilities taht may ahve seemed uniamginable.Safe for you, unsafe for your dogsFeed the freshest meat-based food that you can. Avoid fillers such as most grains and potatoes. Nutrition is the pre-requisite for your dog's health. Educate yourself about complete and balanced meal supplemented by fruits and vegetables. Also do not let your own lifestyle beliefs affect the dog. Curd rice is not a food for dogs, just like milk/ rice or dal /rice. Also keep in mind that what's safe for humans is not always safe for dogs.For example, dogs cant have onions, raisins, grapes, dry fruits or chocolate or anything with sugar or salt. Table scraps and human foods are a big No. Rawhide bones or treats bought from stores are harmful. Switch over to real bones and make healthy snacks and treats yourself. If time does not permit, there are many ventures providing homemade snacks and treats and even meals for dogs in Bengaluru and all other major cities.Dont get your dogs addicted to drugsMinimise drug use, like anti-biotic and steroid based medications. Explore alternative medicines like homeopathic treatment to safely and gently stimulate natural healing. Keep an open mind in order to find the best ways to care for your pet. Learn to recognise the early warning signs of disease. Never neglect symptoms. Prevent parasites such as ticks and fleas. Its best to prevent these parasites if you can, rather than trying to treat them after your dog gets affected.Regular or daily grooming or putting a tick collar on your dog will help prevent ticks and fleas. Some people use essential oils to help repel parasites. Lemon eucalyptus can help repel mosquitoes. Lavender can have a calming effect on dogs. Aloe Vera gel, for instance, can be used on dogs to help with minor cuts or burns. However, it shouldn't be ingested by dogs.Homeopathic Bach flower remedy does wonders for soothing and calming a dog. Tea tree oil can help in keeping fleas away so does a mix of coconut oil and camphor. For skin problems, fish oil may be beneficial, and vitamins C and E may help reduce inflammations. Massage can be another option in place of or as a supplement to conventional treatment. It can help with mobility issues if your dog has swelling or suffers from arthritis. It can also help reduce anxiety in overly anxious dogs. But conventional medicine be ignored. Not all issues can be treated by alternative medicines and everything should be undertaken under proper medical guidance.Mark you calendar for vet visitsRegular vet visits are necessary. Dont ignore any symptoms however minor. Especially for your older dogs, its necessary that you do annual check-up as a preventive action. Also, if your dog is in obvious distress, such as having non-stop vomiting or breathing problems, a vet needs to see it. Constant whimpering or whining is also an indication your dog may need to see a vet. Add supplements if your dog is unhealthy but only under vets supervision and when necessary.Detergents can irritate dogs skinTry to avoid environmental toxins. Use safer (and green) cleaning products. Actively try to move over to natural or herbal cleaning agents like bio enzymes for cleaning your house. Sometimes a minor thing like a cleaning detergent or air-spray can cause harm to your pet leading to allergies and skin rashes.Socialising is important for pets tooMinimise emotional and environmental stress. Never scream at or leave your pet alone for long periods. Interact and mentally stimulate your pet as often as possible. Enrich his environment by providing stimulating toys. Make him a part of your family because pets, especially dogs, crave for human attention and company. Take him to pet events or day board him so that he socialises with other dogs and humans.Dogs need to work out every dayJust like you, your dog also needs plenty of exercise to stay healthy with say daily walks. Swimming is great way of keeping your pet healthy and happy. Every pet needs enough physical and mental stimulation, lack of which will result in an unhappy pet with behavioural issues. When you walk your pets, devote that time to him. If we want a holistic care for your pets, we should start by making sure that they have a healthy lifestyle."

The Maoist members had visited the houses on Sunday night. However, it was kept a secret till Monday evening. It was through schoolchildren that the news was spread among the villagers.Puttur DySP Srinivas said that the visit of Maoists to the houses has been confirmed. Two teams of ANF have started combing operations.'Did not threaten'One of the residents of the house that the Maoists visited said, ""The members just informed that they were Maoists and asked us not to inform anyone. They did not threaten us.""A team with two men and a woman entered the house at 7.30 pm on Sunday. After introducing themselves as Purushotham, Rajesh and Latha, they asked for groceries. ""When I informed that there is no rice and asked them whether they needed dosa and tea, they replied in the negative."" They also wanted to know whether there is any rich person's house in the village, the resident said.When my brother visited the house, they accompanied him to his house. They were in my house for 10 minutes only. All were wearing green trousers and shirt and were armed, the resident said.Her brother said, ""Maoist Rajesh asked for 10 kg of rice. When I said there are no shops nearby, they demanded rice from the house. They have taken 3 kg boiled rice, 8 kg white rice, tomato and potato from my house.""Enquiries madeThe trio were also asking for Biju, whom they said had reportedly informed the police about their visit to Subrahmanya last time.As a result, one of their collegue Yellappa was killed in crossfire with the ANF (in 2012).Another resident said: ""I encountered three members of the Maoists first. My parents had gone to the temple on account of Sankranti. When I heard dogs barking, I came out of the house and saw three armed persons at my yard. When they introduced themselves as Maoists, I ran towards my uncle's house."""

It is only about 10 percent of the countrys total children who are receiving adequate diet.Furthermore, about 55 percent of non-pregnant women and 58 percent of pregnant women aged between aged 15-49 years are anemic.A large part of India continues to consume non-nutritious, non-balanced food either in the form of under-nutrition, over-nutrition or micronutrient deficiencies. It is important to understand that mal-nutrition derives not just from lack of food but from a diverse set of inter-linked processes linking health care, education, sanitation, hygiene, access to resources and women empowerment, the paper said.ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat said the government needs to pursue policies which focus on removing health and social inequities. Programmes and policies that aim to address the nutrition burden present a double  win situation.The adverse, irreversible and inter-generational impacts of malnutrition make optimal nutrition critical to the development of the country as a whole and all its citizens.The paper said in order to cater to the large unmet needs of micro-nutrients, it is imperative to focus on production diversity as well as food fortification at a macro level.For instance, millets are three to five times more nutritious than rice and wheat in terms of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. They are cost effective crops as well; yet considered as poor peoples crop while rice and wheat are preferred over them. Millets are rich in Vitamin B, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc and are gluten-free. They are suitable for people with gluten allergies or those with high blood sugar levels."

The BJP is not only a political party but it is also an ideology, a campaign and a resolve to build a new India. Therefore, those who have associated with the worlds largest party today have associated themselves with the campaign to build a new India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah said addressing youths at Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth sports ground here.The event is being seen as the start of the BJPs preparation for the Lok Sabha election due in 2019.He said the BJP was the only party which gave a chance to a chaiwala (tea vendor) to become prime minister and a booth level worker (Amit Shah himself) to head the worlds largest political party.This party (BJP) does not run on the basis of caste nor is it governed by a gharana (dynasty). This party is run by workers, he said as he took a swipe at the Congress.The Congress politics of vote bank and gharana (dynasty) has become obsolete.

As a people, it is ingrained in us to reuse and recycle as much as possible. Photo: MintSometime back, I had written about planned obsolescence and the challenges of the disposable economy. About how products today are designed to have a shelf lifea period of time during which they can be used and after which we are constrained to replace themeither because a newer, more feature-rich model has presented itself or because the latest apps and software run too slowly on these old machines.This economic construct requires a resource-intensive industrial infrastructure that focuses exclusively on the extraction and consumption of natural resources without paying heed to the need for replenishment or conservation.There is an alternative way to think about industrial value creation, a model that is regenerative by design and aimed at ensuring that products are maintained at their highest utility at all times. This is the principle behind the concept of the circular economy that describes a continuous cycle aimed at preserving capital and minimizing system risk by efficiently tracking and managing finite stocks.At its essence, the circular economy requires that value creation be decoupled from consumption of finite resources. It draws its inspiration from the biological world where the nutrients that are metabolized by life processes are generated from other living systems after their death and ensures that the earth remains a stable, self-contained ecosystem.The circular economy attempts to mimic this circle of life, trying to achieve the same results through technical cycles that recover and restore products and components through strategies like reuse, repair, refurbishment, re-manufacture and re-cycling. It depends on sustainable practices, but more than that, looks to encourage a change in the way in which people think about their business. It asks them to focus on keeping products alive for as long as possible rather than requiring them to be constantly replaced.Indian society has always had circular ideals. As a people, it is ingrained in us to reuse and recycle as much as possible. We are always looking for new ways in which to squeeze extended value out of discarded objects, transforming our old T-shirts into washcloths, dusters and mops, discarding them only when they are too frayed to use. On average we reuse up to 60% of our discarded plastics10 times as much as the US.However, for the most part, this recycling happens at the end of the value chain by the poorest sections of societymost of whom treat this as a scarcity management strategy rather than as an integral part of the economic construct. This results in value loss, not to mention health risks for those who extract value from waste (the rag pickers and garbage processors). Additionally, as the Indian middle class has begun to expand, we have begun to forget our cyclical habits, increasingly seduced by Western models of conspicuous consumption.We have the opportunity to incorporate principles of the circular economy into our social fabricand the time to do that is now. For instance, much can be improved in the Indian construction industry, which, even though it accounts for 8% of the gross domestic product, is still largely disorganized and resource-inefficient. While the Smart Cities Mission will help bring feedback-driven efficiencies to our cities, we could do with more constructive action in the areas of urban sanitation, water management and local community development.Similarly, in the agricultural sector, we should look to develop digital food supply chains that transmit accurate market information to food producers, connecting them more closely with customers. We could also look to borrow from nature, developing self-sustaining cultivation habits like rice-fish farming, which improves rice yields without the use of fertilizers and pesticides.The other area of the economy that shows considerable promise is urban mobility. By de-emphasizing ownership and creating efficient multi-modal urban transport solutions that, for instance, use ride-hailing technologies for last-mile connectivity, India could ensure that, unlike the West, vehicle ownership never rises above its current 5% levelsand people remain content with using public transport solutions to get to wherever they need to go. This will achieve better utilization as we treat vehicles as a servicenot a product to be owned. When we migrate to electric vehicles that use sustainable charging solutions, we can only expect to achieve greater efficiencies.In order to truly reap these benefits, businesses across industry verticals will need to integrate circular practices into their business practices. They will need to design products that are easy to repair, using materials that are longer lasting. In addition, they will need to create alternatives to planned obsolescence, developing strategies by which products can be re-purposed and generate revenue from services rather than sales. They should find ways to forge cross-industry collaborations with the aim of creating value chains across industry verticals.In 2015, the ministry of environment and forests established the Indian Resource Panel with the specific purpose of facilitating the use of recycled materials and promoting resource efficiency. I can see this initiative facilitating efficient flows of materials from the product design stage to collection after use, repair, reuse, refurbishment, and recycling. After all, all we need to do is to tap our cultural instincts and we will have no problem adapting circular practices directly into our national economic model.Rahul Matthan is a partner at Trilegal.

Even after a decade of commercial cooking I keep going back to my moms kitchen to discover those secret ingredients that enhance food in taste and shelf life, yet keep them honest and organic.While practices such as adding oil to preserve pickles is well known and practised world over, natural emulsifiers from traditional Indian kitchens is still lesser-known.Emulsifiers are substance added to food to keep the oils and fats well mixed with the water base, preventing their separation. Chemically speaking emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends: a hydrophilic end (water-loving) that forms chemical bonds with water and a hydrophobic end (water-hating) that forms chemical bonds with oils.Imagine a simple drink like buttermilk (chaas), when stored for too long, the yoghurt solids of the drink separate from the water base. This separation destroys the form and hence the taste of the food. What if a simple ingredient could help buttermilk retain its form and taste like it was when freshly made?Emulsifiers are rampantly used in packaged food industry and restaurants to increase shelf life.Most of these are artificial lab-made chemicals and they are generally tasteless and have undesired side effects, like allergic and intolerance reactions in consumers. Therefore, such additives in packaged foods must be strictly regulated. On the other hand, natural emulsifiers are safe to eat and contribute to the foods taste, retain form factor while making it last longer.The natural emulsifiers traditionally used for the Indian curry is cashew nut (Anacardium Occidentale), sesame (Sesamum Indicum), watermelon seeds (Citrullus Vulgaris) and poppy seeds (Papaver Somniferum). Gravy made with cashew nut can be frozen without any significant change in the quality.How can you use this at home? While making rice kheer, we add milk to boiled rice. Before adding milk to rice, add some cashew paste to the milk.The cashew paste will enhance the taste of the kheer and also increase the life of the kheer as it will bind the water of the boiled rice with the fat of the milk. Another similar example is adding khoa to gajar ka halwa. Khoa not only enhances the taste and makes the food look richer, but also increases the life of the halwa. For salad dressing, instead of using packaged sauce with high saturated fat, sugar and salt content, try a healthier option. Use cashew-garlic paste, which is a natural ingredient that will enhance the taste and also keep the salad fresh for long.(The writer is co-founder & Head of Culinary at Yumlok Bangalore)"

(File)The government slashed tax rates on some goods and services just days ahead of the country's budget, as it continues to rationalize its six-month-old regime to ease the pain for businesses hit by its chaotic roll out.A panel of union and state finance ministers on Thursday decided to revise GST rates on 29 goods and 53 services, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after a meeting of the GST council. The council recommended reducing rates on diamond and precious stones to 0.25 percent from 3 percent, while the rate on 20-liter bottle of packaged drinking water fell to 12 percent from 18 percent, according to a government statement.The rate cuts may lead to a revenue loss of Rs 1,000 crore ($156.6 million) to Rs 1,200 crore, an official said separately, asking not to be identified citing rules. The adjustments are the latest in a series of tweaks the government has made to the GST.The council recommended reducing rates on old used motor vehicles and buses using bio fuels to 18 percent from 28 percent, while sugar-boiled confectionery and fertilizer grade phosphoric acid dropped to 12 percent from 18 percent. Rates on scientific and technical instruments and liquefied petroleum gas for households fell to 5 percent from 18 percent.A 5 percent tax was imposed on rice bran, while the rate on cigarette filters was increased to 18 percent from 12 percent, it decided.The council will consider including new items into the goods and services tax fold -- including gasoline and real estate -- at the next meeting, Mr Jaitley said. And given the onerous GST return filing procedure, the council is working on simplifying the process. The council is expected to meet again before the end of the month.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has made several changes to the national sales tax launched in July, after disruptions to businesses and supply chains threatened to erode its effectiveness in converting the country into one of world's biggest markets. On Feb. 1, the government is set present the budget, outlining its economic road map for the financial year starting April 1.

Samsung, by comparison, offers more than 40 smartphone models in India.Xiaomi also plans to unveil at least one or two new smart products in 2018.

This is likely to increase by at least 10 per cent in the 2018-19 fiscal, sources said.The total budget allocation for the food ministry is also expected to increase to Rs 2.20 lakh crore (inclusive of food subsidy) in the next fiscal from Rs 1.96 lakh crore in this year, the sources added.The food bill is expected to rise in 2018-19 because of about 7-8 per cent increase in the minimum support price (MSP) of rice and wheat, which are supplied to the poor at subsidised rates via ration shops.Also, the Centre has decided not to hike the issue price of wheat and rice, which at present is Rs 2/kg and Rs 3/kg, respectively, at least till June 2018, the sources said.The issue price is likely to be kept unchanged in 2018- 19 and therefore the total food bill will increase. The government will bear the subsidy burden, the sources said.Sources also said that the focus of the food ministry in the next fiscal would be on making ration shops portable within a district initially and later within a state.This will help beneficiaries buy subsidised grain in any of the ration shop located in a district. Also, the ongoing programmes of computerising the public distribution system (PDS) will continue next year."

The issues will be taken up at the next meeting, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told media persons after the GST Council meeting here.'Vibhuti' (sacred ash), parts and accessories for manufacture of hearing aids and de-oiled rice bran have been exempted from GST while all types of old and used motor vehicles other than medium and large cars and SUVs will now attract 12 per cent instead of 28 per cent GST. Old medium and large cars and SUVs will attract 18 per cent instead of 28 per cent.The rate on sugar-boiled confectionery, drinking water packed in 20 litre bottles, fertiliser-grade phosphoric acid, bio-diesel and drip irrigation system have been reduced from 18 to 12 per cent.Tamarind kernel powder, mehendi paste in cones and domestic LPG supplied by private distributors will attract a reduced duty of five per cent instead of 18 per cent.The exemptions from GST will, among other things, now apply to supply of services for providing information under RTI Act, legal services provided to government, local authority, governmental authority and government entity, transportation of goods from India to outside by air and sea, services relating to admission or conduct of examinations provided to all educational institutions, entrance fees for entrance examination and for transportation of students up to higher secondary schools.GST has been reduced from 18 to 12 per cent on construction of Metro and monorail projects, while on tailoring services it has been brought down from 18 per cent to five per cent. Admission to theme parks, water parks, joy rides, merry-go-rounds, go-carting and ballet will now be taxed at 18 per cent instead of 28 per cent and on common effluent treatment plans services from 18 per cent to 12 per cent.Jaitley said the decisions on changing the tax rates were taken on the recommendations of the fitment committee and the changes will come into force from January 25.Talking about simplifying GST return filing, Jaitley said the Group of Ministers under the Council, officials of GST Network and Nandan Nilekani, Infosys Chairman, held a meeting on the issue. Infosys is the service provider of GSTN.GSTR 3B return filing will continue and all buyers and sellers will continue to load their invoices.Initially there will be 3B return and the supplier invoice would be adequate. The Council felt that once the GoM, IT Committee and Nandan Nilekani discuss the matter and formalise it, then it will be circulated among the ministers and approval will be taken during the next GST Council meeting.The next GST Council meeting will be held via video conferencing soon.The Council also reaffirmed that from January 15 e-way Bill system has started operating on a trial basis. ""From February 1 inter-state e-way bill will be necessary. Fifteen states have said that from February 1, intra-state, they will also start e-way bill.""The Finance Minister said the Council also reviewed GST collections. ""So far we have been relying on unilateral declaration of traders itself. It is necessary to bring in some anti-evasion measures.""He also said that the Composition Scheme was seriously discussed. ""Collection was a matter of concern. Seventeen lakh dealers who have registered themselves at 1 per cent have only deposited Rs 307 crore in the first quarter. The scheme has not been enthusiastically responded. Most of the people have registered themselves below Rs 20 lakh. There seemed to be cases of under-declaration.""He said that of the money collected under Integrated GST, a sum of Rs 35,000 would be provisionally divided between Centre and the states.Bihar Finance Minister and deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said the remaining Rs one lakh crore would be settled on a future date.On direct collections, Jaitley said the government was way ahead of the direct with taxes growing at 18.7 per cent.Asked about the Congress demand for inclusion of petroleum products in the GST, the Finance Minister said it did not come up on Thursday. It will be discussed in the next meeting, he added.Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal said that when the GST was brought in, there was a lot of hype that it will contribute to growth in GDP and tax collections but after eight months the GDP and revenue collections had actually come down."

Photo: Samar HalarnkarI am a storehouse of what my wife calls useless information. I get withering looks when I tell her which B- or C-lister is dating, whos getting married, what their workouts are and where they vacationed this winter. She has no interest in the fact that the svelte actor who rules the Kannada film industry is, like her, a Sindhi. Shes Galrani, youre Ramani, and you both do yoga, I tell herbut she has already left the room.Oh well.You see, in this breathless era of the smartphone and Twitter, I read five local newspapers, which is where I glean these nuggets. I read the pages that the few people still reading newspapers immediately discardthe city and lifestyle sections. Dominated by lurid gossip and paid-for puff publicity, these pages often have realalbeit badly writtenlocal news.Thats how I knewwhile reading the Deccan Herald city section at the doctorsthat the annual avarebele mela was on, a street-food festival based on a single bean, the avarekai, avarekalu or avarebele, Kannada words for the hyacinth or field bean.Bengaluru is known for its festivals celebrating agricultural products. These fairs offer relaxed markets where farmers, traders and city slickers mingle. We have an annual kadalekai parishe, or peanut fair, and last week, while running through the citys sprawling Cubbon Park, I dodged enthusiasts thronging a millets fair and millets marathonthe agriculture minister, whose trim frame betrays a proclivity to fitness, enthusiastically participated in the latter.My wife, who always persuades me to patronize the local Ramzan and Christmas festivitieswhich she can appreciate through only sight and soundhas always wanted to indulge her own culinary tastes, which are vegetarian and appreciative of local farmers and traditions. The problem is the bean and peanut festivals are across town, and given my reluctance to engage with Bengalurus formidable traffic, we had not been there.One bright winter morning, I bundled her into an autorickshaw and off we went to Sajjan Rao Circle in VV Puram, where old traditions, homes and trees linger. This is a vegetarian Kannadiga stronghold, and that is evident in the meat-free offerings on thindi beedi, or food street, a 100m stretch of carts, small eateries and condiment stores. One of these, Sri Vasavi Condiments, organizes the annual avarebele mela that focuses entirely on a green-and-white broad bean, made with skin or without. The bean is particularly appropriate for a city that is often called bean town in the English translation from one of its supposed root names, bende kaal ooru, or town/village of boiled beans (although this is likely bunkum).Everything at the fair was about the avare bean, and nothing was costlier than Rs60. The avarebele was mixed with dosa, idli and bonda batters; worked into curries, ragi and rice rotis; blended with pulaos, upmas, payasams and evengreenhoney jalebis. Oh, how could I forget the union of north and south, the avarebele rumali roti, and, of course, that pinnacle of fusion, avarebele manchurian. I daresay no other festival boasts of the wild experimentation of the green bean soire, although I refused to experiment with the last two. We jostled around the coupon issuers, grabbed our precious tokens and waved them frantically at the chefs until we got, on leaf plates, our avarebele dosa with hithkabeleor beans without skinsaru (curry), avarebele ragi roti and avarebele idlis. We packed avarebele chikki, spiced hithkabele snacks and raw beans and plunged into the midday traffic to make our way back home.The next day, I cooked the beans and tossed them with some sea salt, hoping to create my own avarebele entre. The first thing I did was to integrate them with our daily dosa, as you can see in the recipe below. I think the Sri Vasavi Condiments dosa was made from beans with the skinavarelebe dosa, while mine was hithkabele, without the skin.I was happy to have finally made the long-pending journey to the mela. The avarebele has been a gap in my acquaintance with state tradition; about 90% of the southern crop comes from Karnataka. I have eaten the basic curry now and then, but I was not acquainted with the beans diverse uses. The avarebele is nutritious, packed as it is with vitamins and iron, and it is a particularly important source of protein for vegetarians. In Bengaluru, even those who dont eat iteven in my homeapparently know of the great, green bean.After we returned home the day of the fair, I was telling my pork-eating seven-year-old of our trip and how we had eaten all manner of delicious food made with green-and-white beans; you know, I told her, the same beans we sometimes pick up from Cubbon Park when we go cycling. Oh, she said, you mean avarekai.Hithkabele DosaMakes 4IngredientsBatter to make four dosas1 cup of peeled hyacinth beans (hithkabele)2 tbsp onion, chopped1/2 green chilli, chopped finely1 tbsp coriander, chopped finely1 tbsp tomato, chopped finelySea salt to taste1/2 tsp gheeMethodPlace the beans in a pressure-cooker steamer with water below.

This was revealed in a presentation made by C M Sushanth, a scientist at the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management, at a seminar on The Awareness of Water Resources Management at the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (Kufos) here on Wednesday. According to him, this includes both direct and indirect consumption of water.A Malayali indirectly consumes 100 times more water than what he consumes directly because it is a consumerist society. Moreover, the eating habits of the community have an impact on the higher rate of water consumption. When one kilogram of rice is brought to Kerala from Andhra Pradesh or Telangana, it amounts to 10,000 litres of water. One kg of meat needs 1,000 times more water to produce than producing one kg of vegetable, said Sushanth.The seminar by the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology & Environment(KSCSTE) and Kerala Forest Research Centre was held in the lead-up to the 30th Kerala Science Congress scheduled for this month-end in Thalassery. C N Ravishankar, Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) director inaugurated the seminar while B M Sherin, KSCSTE member underscored the importance of the Kerala Science Congress.

(Reuters)When US President Donald Trump launches into one of his tweetstorms it sometimes seems like the diplomatic world is gasping in unison -- but not Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.Many foreign policy professionals have set up alerts so their phones buzz in their pockets whenever the commander-in-chief insults a foreign leader or issues a vague threat of war.But not Tillerson, Washington's chief diplomat and arguably the man who has the toughest job clearing the air after Trump sets off another diplomatic incident with a social media rant.Tillerson is not on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. When Trump sends a tweet on world affairs a State Department aide prints it and brings it to the secretary for later perusal.At least, that is how he explained things to his friend and predecessor Condoleezza Rice on Wednesday in a chat after a speech at Stanford University in California.Rice asked Tillerson a question he gets asked all the time: how can he handle US foreign policy with Trump constantly stirring the pot with his undiplomatic tweets?Tillerson's reply went into more detail than usual -- although he again insisted that he has no problem with Trump's remarks and sees them as an opportunity to communicate his vision.""He's world class in social media, and I'm not,"" 65-year-old former oilman Tillerson admitted. ""I have no social media account, I've never had any and I don't intend to have any.""""It is a great tool when it is used well. The president has used it at a great effect by by-passing the traditional means of communicating,"" he told the assembled policy experts.""And he absolutely thrives with his ability to instantly communicate not just to the American people but to our friends and allies or to our adversaries in the entire world.""This much has been said before, but surely Tillerson receives a warning before Trump abruptly cancels a planned trip to London or threatens to pull out of the NAFTA trade pact?The answer is not, apparently. Tillerson likes it that way.""I don't know when he's going to do that, because that is just the way the president operates,"" he said.""The challenge is just getting caught up because I don't even have a Twitter account to follow what he's tweeting. My staff usually has to print his tweets out and hand them to me.""""I've actually concluded that's not a bad system.""'How do we use that?'Tillerson explained that it might be anything up to an hour post tweet that he finds out what Trump has been saying, and that means he can gauge official reaction before responding.""I already have the early reactions to that and it allows me to begin to think about: 'How do we take that?',"" he said.""OK, this is information. We know what our objectives are and he didn't change any of them. This is just the way he wants to communicate on a subject, how do we take that and use it?""Tillerson remains sanguine about Trump's exotic online monologue, which some critics fear could alienate US allies, despite having fallen foul of it more than once himself.In October last year, Tillerson met senior Chinese leaders in Beijing and afterwards told reporters that he had back channel communications open with Kim Jong-Un's North Korea.When Tillerson arrived back in Washington he discovered -- presumably on being handed a print out -- that Trump had disavowed his efforts to resolve the nuclear stand-off.""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,"" Trump had tweeted. ""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what needs to be done!"""

The discussion lasted about 30 minutes. Topics ranged from 2017 German election results, India-US relations, Russia-India ties, and more.The next day, I got a confirmation call about my selection for the programme, and Ivan requested me to book a hotel in Moscow, so the name can be printed on the invitation letter. With his assistance, I zeroed upon Semenovsky mini-hotel, which had accommodation for as low as 800 RUB per night, for a shared dormitory comprising four people. It fit my budget perfectly, and was close to the news channels office. I promptly booked it, and gave the details to Ivan, who immediately sent me an official invitation.That was the beginning of my Russian dream.The participants get together on the final day of the training programme. From left to right (standing)  Ignacio, Alex, Valeria, Trevor, Maria, Axel, Damir; (seated)  Riley, Ivan, SofiaThat evening, I informed my City Editor, who kindly approved my three-week leave, despite being short on resources during that period.I fixed an appointment at the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Chennai for Friday morning. I submitted my documents and requested for a same-day Tourist visa. I was asked to come back in the afternoon. When I went back to the Consulate, Vice-Consul (Press and Public Relations) Yury Belov asked for the purpose of my visit to Moscow, and I told him. He then asked for an itinerary of the training programme, which I did not have at that moment. However, I gave him the official invitation sent by Ivan, and Yury said he would contact Ivan on the same. And he approved my visa. I said Spasibo (Russian for thank you) and sprinted out.Immediately, I went to a nearby Internet cafe and booked the return flight tickets. Later, I flew back to Hyderabad. That evening, I emailed my Assistant Resident Editor about the visa approval and my upcoming trip. Despite informing her at the last moment, she graciously gave the final go-ahead.The next couple of days were a blur. Went shopping for some must-takes such as winter jacket and footwear that can withstand snow, namkeens, biscuits, etc.My family supported me wholeheartedly, though it was less than a month for my sisters marriage, which was on November 10. That, by the way, was the final day of the training programme! However, I intended to leave by November 8 itself, in order to be in time for the occasion.After standing for over 90 minutes in the long and winding queue at Delhis immigration, I finally got my passport stamped and boarded the Aeroflot flight to Moscow, of six-hour duration. The dream was turning to reality!Aeroflot pampers you with fruit juices, soft drinks, meals, and even ice cream! And the editorial quality of their in-flight magazine was top-notch. I dozed off for some time, and soon enough, landed at Sheremetyevo International Airport. Their passport control was a breeze, and got finished in less than five minutes. I exchanged the USD I had with RUB at the airport, and got myself a MegaFon sim. Called my family and later, boarded a taxi waiting outside to the hotel.Whizzing past the snow-covered landscape, the taxi driver Ilya and I chatted about Moscow, economy, politics, India and more. He said he even watches movies of Amitabh Bachchan, Mithun Chakraborty and other actors! After arriving at the hotel, I checked in, and found the room had four beds, one for each. My roommate Vadim welcomed me warmly.The hotel had a common kitchen with utensils, microwave and gas stove, where boarders can cook. I ate namkeens and slept for an hour or so. After waking up, got ready and left for office. I boarded 469K mini-bus to Semyonovskaya Metro station, about 2 km away. After getting down, I asked a couple of bystanders about the address, and one old woman explained in great detail about the path to take, which, unfortunately, I could not understand as she spoke in Russian. Nevertheless, I thanked her and later called Ivan, who guided me precisely to the destination!Ivan received me at the reception, and later, after the other participants joined, we introduced ourselves. Including myself, there were 11 of us in the programme. On the first day, we had an introductory session by the organisations Managing Director Alexey Nikolov, who spoke about the history of the channel, what it stands for, how it places emphasis on covering both sides of a story, etc.While returning to the hotel, I got confused about the route to be taken. The cold was biting, and I was alone, feeling lost. Luckily, a few maintenance workers were around, and they showed me the way to Semyonovskaya Metro. After reaching the bus stand near the metro station, I waited for 469K mini-bus for few minutes, but did not find any coming. Neither were any taxis nearby. I found a young woman, Natalia, at the bus stand. Went over to her and requested her to book a taxi. She kindly consented, and booked a cab from her Yandex Taxi app, and even spoke to the driver in Russian and helped me find the cab! Priyatno poznakomitsya (Nice to meet you), she said, while waving goodbye. Who would offer such help to a stranger, I thought, as I thanked her profusely. I got to my room safely.I had a sound sleep, woke up the next day and went to a grocery story that was right opposite the hotel (lucky me), and I scoured for bread and butter. The cashier Assa spoke English, and helped me in choosing the right kind of butter, which tasted delicious!The session that day was on the various departments in the Newsroom, facilitated by Maria Zeleranskaya, Head of Moscow Newsroom. Later, I reached my room without getting lost!The next day, I left for office early for a session on Dalet, a News Production and Distribution platform, which was conducted by Ivan. Afterwards, had rice and boiled potatoes at the office cafeteria, which was tasty and filling. I instantly liked it, and that became my diet for the next two weeks! During the time we spent in the cafeteria, I had lively discussions on a range of topics along with the other participants.The rest of the classes were on News Producing and Reporting, News Presenting, Creative Projects, and more. In the second week, I volunteered to assist the Social Media team on their daily tasks. Natasha, a team member, taught me activities such as selecting interesting videos from Agencies, video editing in Dalet, writing headline and description for YouTube, and other tasks. Despite having a busy schedule, she took time to explain me in detail about their processes. Evelina, her teammate, also helped in answering my queries.After a few days, a new roommate Svetlana joined us. She said she works as an assistant Anesthesiologist at a clinic in Ulyanovsk, the birthplace of communist revolutionary Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin), about 800 km from Moscow. She spoke good English.That weekend, Svetlana asked me if I was interested in visiting an Art museum and Red Square. Sure, why not, I said. Bubbling with enthusiasm, I got ready in ten minutes (normally I take an hour) and off we went, on Moscow Metro!Viewing the imposing Red Square gave me goosebumps. The grandeur of nearby renowned landmarks such as Saint Basils Cathedral and GUM Department Store cannot be described in words. It has to be experienced firsthand. Lenins Mausoleum also occupies a prominent place, which contains his embalmed body.Later, we visited Moskva River and spent a few minutes observing the traffic pass by the River from a vantage point. Afterwards, we went to The Tretyakov Gallery, an Art museum that had numerous paintings of renowned Russian artists, and spent a good two hours going through the masterpieces.In the evening, we visited Red Square once again. Lo and behold, it was bedecked with lighting, and was exactly like in the video I had watched online a few months ago! Visualisation matters a lot, I thought to myself. Incidentally, it was National Unity Day, which commemorates the event when all classes of Russian society united to expel the occupation forces from Moscow in November 1612, thus preserving the statehood. Later, we spent a few minutes at Kazan Cathedral, a Russian Orthodox church, where Svetlana gave me a candle to light and pray. She did the same.After we returned to the room, Svetlana asked me, Are you happy? How can I be not happy? Yes, thanks a lot! I replied. The next morning, she left for her home town of Ulyanovsk.On the penultimate day, I attended the class for one last time and bade goodbye to Ivan and my co-participants. I also bid adieu to the Social Media team, and Natasha gifted me a big box of Russian chocolates! The next morning, I left for the airport and boarded the Aeroflot flight back to India.From people who wish Priyatno appetit (bon apptit) while having food to showing directions to destination, from strangers who help book a cab to saying Hindi-Rus bhai bhai, my brief stay in Russia had been an enjoyable experience filled with unforgettable memories.

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintNew Delhi: India is considering simpler regulations to attract more corporate investment in agriculture as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to keep his promise to double farmers income by 2022, an adviser to the government said.Asias third-largest economy, more than half the countrys population depend on farming for their livelihood, should relax rules for companies investing in contract farming, transport, marketing, warehouses and food processing, said Ramesh Chand, member of the government think tank National Institution for Transforming India, also called NITI Aayog. Indias farms should become outsourcing hubs for global supermarket chains, he said, noting he expects an announcement on the policy in the 1 February budget.We need to simplify regulation, give incentives and remove hurdles in their way, said Chand in an interview in New Delhi. For any improvement in farmers income, private corporate investments in farming should at least double from the current 2% of total annual investments in agriculture, he said.Agriculture, which contributes 17% to the $2.3-trillion economy, has remained relatively untouched by reforms with growth rates averaging below 3% over as many decades. Lack of technology, inefficient markets and small landholdings have worsened challenges.About a quarter Indian farmers live below the official poverty line, while 52% of farming households are indebted in spite of guaranteed prices for crop purchases by the federal government on at least three cropswheat, rice and cotton. Farmers have long been demanding 50% profits over the cost of production and waiver of their agricultural loans.Jagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Ministers Office, didnt respond to a call seeking comment.Indian states currently allow contract farming only for selective crops. The federal government has sought public comments for a model contract farming act unveiled in December.Higher investments by companies including PepsiCo., Hindustan Unilever Ltd., ITC Ltd., which buy from farmers in some states, could boost incomes faster at a time when India is predicted to expand at the slowest pace since Modi came to power in 2014. Gross domestic product is expected to grow at 6.5 percent in the year through March, mainly due to poor performance of agriculture and manufacturing.In consultation with states, Chand said his think tank is pushing for a new price support scheme.Under the proposed Market Assurance Scheme, states procuring crops other than rice, wheat and cotton from farmers will be compensated by the federal government for up to 40% of the losses on procurement cost, he said.

A number of factors like shrinking agricultural land owing to the fast paced urbanisation led to the fast fading of that exclusive variety of rice.Lack of marketing facilities and the government support such as subsidies were other factors that pushed Doon Basmati rice to the brink of extinction, Shah said.Surya Prakash Bahuguna, a rice grower, said Doon Basmati rice was also once grown in what has now developed into a massive urban area.Farming of Doon Basmati rice is now confined to a few areas that can be counted on finger tips, he explained referring to Haripur, Dhakrani, Dharmawala, Pratitpur, Ambawadi etc.Shah said not much is now known about the real variety of Doon Basmati rice which is known by its botanical term Oryza sativa Type 3.In fact, a host of other varieties of Basmati rice are sold in the name of Doon Basmati, he said, adding that it is as a very delicate variety of rice.It is endemic to the Doon valley owing to its typical agro-climatic conditions. Besides, this species of rice survives in running water only, Shah said.Then, it is an absolutely organically produced cereal which tends to lose its aroma and flavour if chemical fertilisers or pesticides are used in growing it.The study being carried out by the expert group would take into consideration all these aspects. This group will also have a representative of an organic certification agency as one of its members, Shah said.Plans were also underway to carry out Geographical Indications Registry of Doon Basmati rice, so it could be patented.We are also creating a seed bank of this exclusive variety of rice with the help of farmers who grow it, Shah said, adding robust marketing facilities would also be created.Plans were also afoot to create a gene pool of Doon Basmati rice.We will recommend that the state government also propagate this rare variety of rice in other areas of the state where agro-climatic conditions will suit it, Shah said.Bahuguna appreciated the efforts being made by the board to rejuvenate Doon Basmati rice.He, however, hoped that the move the board has initiated will be taken to its logical conclusion."

It was suspected that the jailbreak  which saw Khalistan Liberation Force chief Harminder Singh alias Mintoo along with five others escape from the Punjab prison  was planned at their hideout.Last November, it came to light that three shooters, who fatally attacked gangster Devpal Rana at a Roorkee court, had been living in a rented apartment in Race Course area. Hired by another gangster Rishipal Rana, the flat was used by the shooters to plan the murder.In April, Doon was shocked when the Jharkhand police along with its Uttarakhand counterpart arrested dreaded criminal Vikram Sharma from Aman Vihar area. Wanted in many cases and carrying a reward of Rs 30,000, Sharma was hiding in Dehradun since 2012 to evade arrest.Even Shahrukh Pathan, a sharpshooter who worked for the notorious interstate Jeeva Gang, confessed to have stayed in Dehradun for about a month last year. Wanted in the murder of Haridwar-based businessman Amit Dixit in March 2017, the hardcore criminal carrying a reward of Rs 60,000 was arrested from Delhi by the Special Task Force of the Uttarakhand police in November.Former director general of police Aloke Bihari Lal said a criminal rushing away to evade arrest has two things in mind. They run away from the safest escape route and theyd like to go to a place (to hide) where theres possibility of an easy hideout.Being a gateway to the Garhwal hills and the base for hill towns like Mussoorie, Dhanaulti and Chakrata, Dehradun gets more than 20 lakh tourists annually. It is well connected with Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi by roads. The distance can be easily covered in a matter of few hours.Additional director general of police, law and order, Ashok Kumar said such criminals often take advantage of interstate boundaries as officials in other states may not know about wanted status. Likewise, criminals from here hide in other states. Moreover, it is easy for people to hide in tourist places like Dehradun which have a high floating population (almost 1 lakh).With full-fledged functioning of state-of-the-art, technology based criminal tracking network and system (CCTNS), things will become difficult for such criminals looking to enter Uttarakhand, he added.Superintendent of police (city) Pradeep Kumar Rai said the police would take action against the owner of the house (where Singh and accomplices were hiding) for not carrying out police verification of tenants. Later in the day, a challan was also slapped against the house owner under the Police Act.A hardened criminal, Harsimrandeep Singh alias Simma has a long history of crime and carried a reward of Rs 2 lakh in Punjab. He had allegedly murdered a rice mill owner in Punjabs Faridkot in July last year and confessed to having committed the crime on a Facebook post.Singh along with three other accomplices was arrested after a joint operation by the Dehradun and Punjab police from Rajendra Nagar area here late on Saturday, Dehradun senior superintendent of police Nivedita Kukreti Kumar said. A revolver and six live cartridges were confiscated from Singh, who has been allegedly involved in several cases of extortion, murder, loot at gunpoint and abduction in Punjab. He hails from Bewal Kalan village in Bajakhana area of Faridkot.His accomplices - Phoolvinder Singh from Faridkot and Ramesh Kumar and Rohit Badu from Hanumangarh (Rajasthan) - were also arrested with arms. All the accused were booked under the Arms Act. The four were produced before a court on Sunday which sent them to police custody for two days."

Fake notes not only appear in smaller denominations like Rs 100, Rs 50 and Rs 10, but also in post-demonetisation currencies of Rs 2,000, and Rs 500. Most most part, they are undetected.We have had customers giving counterfeit currencies of both Rs 2,000 and Rs 500, said Jeevarathinam, proprietor of Thanigachalam Mudaliar Rice Shop on MG Road. I had to return the notes and ask them for real ones, he said, adding that people had given him counterfeits on at least three occasions in the last six months. Jeevarathinam now has a fake money detection machine.While some came from floating population, some came from regular customers. A customer was surprised when a store refused to accept a Rs 50 note, stating it was counterfeit. The customer, who received the note as change, felt swindled and even tried to remember who had given it."

For instance, a total of 10,808 people were lined up in the Chamarajanagar Assembly constituency to receive benefits under various schemes during his recent visit there.Since May 2013, the government largesse has reached 15.65 crore beneficiaries under various schemes, including those rolled out by the previous governments such as the Arivu education loan scheme, the Bhagyalakshmi girl child assistance scheme, the Yeshasvini health insurance among others.However, welfare schemes rolled out by the Siddaramaiah regime - 18 to be precise, catering to below poverty line (BPL) households, farmers, minorities, backward classes and Dalits - have 5.87 crore beneficiaries, Chief Minister's Office (CMO) numbers show.It is this reach the ruling Congress is banking on ahead of the upcoming Assembly polls. The party's central leadership is already pushing out the narrative of the 'Karnataka model'. ""This will be our pitch to the people,"" said Rajya Sabha MP M V Rajeev Gowda, who heads the AICC research department.AICC national spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi also defended the government's Ahinda focus. ""It is the responsibility of the government to uplift weaker sections of society much as it may be criticised.""The populist Anna Bhagya scheme takes the cake. In the government's book, the scheme reaches 1.14 crore BPL families, but the beneficiary number is shown as 3.79 crore. That is because an average family has four persons, a CMO official explained.The beneficiary number swells further because one person is highly likely to be covered under multiple schemes. For instance, a household receiving rice under Anna Bhagya will also get free gas cylinder under Anila Bhagya. ""Both schemes are different, so they can target the same beneficiaries,"" the official said.Interestingly, the state government's expenditure on subsidies has doubled since the Congress came to power, from about Rs 12,000 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 24,000 crore this fiscal."

But, the steam cake-maker, both bamboo and chiratta types, are in high demand. The two products have made a real comeback with the emergence of the puttu in various avatars, said Biju A Davis, of Vedhaandh Handicrafts, Kodakara.We used to subject the bamboo to chemical treatment to make various handicraft items. But the bamboo used to make steam cake-makers and wooden ladles would be subjected to ayurvedic treatment after the routine seasoning of bamboo wood, as it is being used to make food. In fact, several Keralites who buy the implement out of curiosity cannot manage the item like our elders did, Davis explained. Since it is an eco-friendly perishable material, the cake-maker has to be used in the traditional way, if it is to survive for long. Though it costs a little more than the steel vessel, the bamboo cake-maker is the best alternative for those who wish to switch to eco-friendly kitchen utensils.The emergence of puttu not only as breakfast, but as a dish fit for lunch, dinner or even for high-tea, created a niche for bamboo and coconut shell products in the handicraft industry, Davis said.In fact, among the various handicraft items displayed at a fair organised recently at Rasa Gurukul, near Poolani, Chalakudy, Kerala, the traditional steam cake-makers were the chief attraction. Das Sreedhar, a London-based hotelier who owns half a dozen hotels in the UK said he organised the fair to familiarise the younger generation with the age-old practices.Puttu has already made its way to luxury restaurants and eateries and so is the case with the bamboo steam cake-makers. Now the wafting aroma of the steam cake made from bamboo utensils is redefining its legacy. Around two dozen kinds of puttu mixed with minced meat, fruits, vegetables and grated coconut are not only providing a new experience to food buffs, but also a lease of life to the traditional handicraft."

The millers have been blacklisted and purchase of state pool rice from Nagarkurnool mills suspended.As there was a shortage of stock, government was purchasing 6 lakh tonnes of raw rice for PDS and 1.5 lakh tonnes of fine rice from millers to supply for midday meals and social welfare schemes. The process was conducted through tenders. The enforcement wing and technical teams conducted raids on godowns and they noticed irregularities in Nagarkurnool and Sircilla districts. In Sircilla, some of the rice millers were supplying inferior quality rice to government.During raids, officials found that rice stored in Jadcherla CWC godown was from two mills of Nagarkurnool. The rice was PDS rice, which was taken from ration shops, recycled and again sold to government.Officials found 1,080 bags (each 50 kg) of PDS rice and its value was estimated at `15 lakh. Sriramulu of Srinivasa Rice Mill, Mallesh of Venkateswara Rice Mill from Nagarkurnool were involved in this illegal sale, officials said.In each lorry (400 to 500 bags) some recycled rice bags were mixed up so that nobody can recognise it. In all, 1,080 bags containing PDS recycled rice were mixed up with fine quality rice. Anand ordered the two rice millers to appear before him at his office, but they did not turn up. After checking the electricity bills of the mills it was found that they were not milling the rice. An investigation was ordered to find the source of the rice.After implementation of ePos system, transporting of PDS rice to black market has become impossible. Keeping this in mind, millers started purchasing rice in advance from the ration shops and stocked the same. Officials recognised that after recycling the PDS rice that millers delivered to government."

Yingluck, whose government was ousted in a 2014 coup, was sentenced in absentia to five years in prison on September 27 for negligence in instituting a money-losing rice subsidy program. She fled Thailand before the verdict and has called the case against her politically motivated.She has not been seen in public since fleeing, but it had been generally assumed that Yingluck was in Dubai or London. Her brother, ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, maintains residences in both cities. Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai told reporters today that a visiting British government minister informed Thai officials that Yingluck has been in London since September.The confirmation of Yinglucks whereabouts came after several photographs of her appeared in Thai and social media in the past few weeks, including one apparently taken with another woman outside Harrods department store in London. Don said the Thai government has not made a decision on whether to ask Britain to extradite Yingluck. We have to do a 360-degree assessment of the situation first, he said.Yinglucks conviction is the latest chapter in a decade-long struggle between Thailands traditional ruling class led by royalists and the military and the powerful political machine founded by Thaksin, who was toppled in a 2006 coup. Thaksin has lived in Dubai since fleeing a corruption conviction that he says was politically motivated.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

How else could one describe the allegations against Health Minister K K Shylaja. What did she do? Submitted some bills and claimed reimbursement she is entitled to. Look at the mud thrown at her for that. For ages kanji or rice porridge has been the staple diet of Malayalees and this is often suggested while under Ayurveda treatment. Critics with no heart have found fault for claiming the bill for kanji and certain other health supplements like onion vada and Gobi Manchurian.They hardly stopped at that. For they didnt even spare the Ministers late mother, blaming her for claiming reimbursement from a non-existent hospital and for declaring that her husband is her dependant. She has stated only plain facts in the declaration - that her husband is solely dependent on her and that he is unemployed. What do these critics know about medical expenses and how hard it is to meet them with the pension of a retired LP School headmaster.Voices are being raised against the Ministers husband seeking treatment from a five-star hospital and a specialty clinic for diabetes. How else does one sort out lifestyle diseases. As lifestyle changes, such diseases are but natural fallouts and one has to seek solutions from the best possible facilities. The government has made provisions for the Minister to claim reimbursement for herself and family. She has done just that, and only what former Chief Ministers and ministers have done. Isnt the deafening silence of the main Opposition party explanatory! BJP leaders like Kummanam Rajasekharan and K Surendran can cry hoarse for they havent had the chance to enjoy the pie yet!But Comrade Shylaja hasnt bothered to explain something. Isnt her act of sending family members to costly private facility a classic statement of the confidence she has in facilities run by the department she rules over? Or are government hospitals only for the poor KSRTC pensioners?Well, she can still justify herself. Unlike many senior Comrades, she didnt go to Russia, Germany or USA; rather chose to endorse the quality of treatment in Keralas private hospitals.If likes were votesGet ready for the magic! The social media accounts and pages of Left ministers are going to be flooded with likes. The directive has gone down from the chief of staff M V Jayarajan. For a change, staffers of all ministers have been asked to follow the footsteps of Finance Minister Thomas Isaac who has managed maximum likes. Even the Chief Minister, with his army of advisers of all sorts, comes only second. In a meeting of personal staff of ministers, Jayarajan came armed with a stat-book of likes, according to which Isaacs official Facebook page has over 6 lakh likes whereas the CM comes a close second with 5.97 lakh. A monitoring mechanism is also reportedly being set up to review action in the pages of ministers. Dont know whether instructions have been issued to transform likes to votes in the next elections!What a transformation for a party which went on the rampage in the AGs Office and Government Secretariat against computers!"

It is the lowest recorded in the last five years. The guidelines issued by the government specified an expenditure of 70 per cent of the plan funds in local bodies by December 31,2017 but the actual development expenditure was 34 and 33 per cent only in the gram and block panchayat, respectively.

I was only a few months old then. My parents took me to the shrine to perform my choroonu (a babys first rice eating ceremony).I was later told that the group comprised my parents, maternal uncle and a Kani tribesman, Nair told Express. Nair was born in November 1939 and the visit was sometime before next November as per the custom. He said his mother was in her youths during the visit. At present, entry of women in the 10-50 age group is banned at the shrine.First three children born to Nairs parents had died as infants. During that time people used to visit the royal family chief for spiritual advise. The chief advised my father to perform my choroonu ritual at the shrine for my healthy life, Nair said.His parents christened him T K Ayyappankutty Nair, in benevolence to Lord Ayyappa, presiding deity of the Sabarimala temple. 78-year-old Nair said he does not know the details of the visit. Perhaps my mother entered the temple through the Malikappuram gate, avoiding the holy 18 steps reserved for those who observe the 41-day abstinence, he says.Women of all ages used to visit Sabarimala: KadakampallyTPuram: Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran on Thursday reiterated his stand that women of all ages used to visit Sabarimala Lord Ayyappa temple in the past. There is evidence that members of the royal family visited the shrine. Women members of well-to-do families used to visit the shrine then, he said. Politically motivated lies, says Rahul Easwar Activist and member of the Thazhamon Madom tantri family, Rahul Easwar on Thursday said the claims of Surendran and T K A Nair were false. Both the arguments are politically motivated lies, he told reporters here on Thursday.Rahul Easwar flayed the decision of the LDF-nominated new office-bearers of Travancore Devaswom Board to cancel the previous boards decision to rechristen the shrine as Sree Ayyappaswami temple. It is the agenda of non-believers to name the temple as Sree Dharma Sastha temple. Devotees want the temple to be known as Ayyappa temple. Lord Ayyappa is a celibate god while Lord Dharma Sastha has two wives as per the belief, he said."

Mane Mkrtchyan, her family at their Lajpat Nagar home.By Anchita GhoshChristmas and New Year festivities are over for most, but not in a few houses in the capital. A Lajpat Nagar address  home to the only pure Armenian family in the capital  is gearing up to celebrate Christmas on January 6, when Jesus Christ was baptised.The occupant of the house, Mane Mkrtchyan (27), who made India her home around 10 years ago, says Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity in the year 301.We have always celebrated Christmas on January 6. December 25 became popular under Roman influence in the 4th century, said Mane, who lives in Delhi with her mother, twin sister and a nephew. Her father Senekerim Mkrtchyan, a retired engineer, joins them for six months during winters. This year, her other sister, who lives in Moscow with her family, has also joined them with her two children for Christmas.Though Manes is the only pure Armenian family in the city, there are around 50 Indo-Armenian families in the NCR. Among them is Dr Gayane Movsisyan Sayeed, MD, Cardiologist and president of Armenian Cultural Centre in Delhi.Dr Gayane says Armenia is the only country to follow Apostolic Church, which celebrates Christmas on January 6.Celebrations start from December 31 with some keeping a seven-day fast, said Dr Gayane. The day starts with prayers and ends with a community get-together and feasting. Since there is no Armenian church in Delhi, we mostly pray at home, she says.Christmas is all about time with family and home-cooked food, said Mane, a PhD scholar in Hindi from JNU. She says some of the must-haves on the Christmas table include gaphama  rice and dry fruits, including raisins, steamed inside a pumpkin  lavash, a tandoori-like bread and fish.Dr Gayane says rice, raisins and fish have a meaning too. Rice represents the world and raisins symbolise the Christians. Fish is the symbol of Jesus Christ, says Dr Gayane.Every year, around this time, the citys small Armenian community comes together. This time, the gathering was at India Habitat Centre on January 1.Mane, however, hopes to spread the word on her countrys culture through the Armenian Cultural Centre, founded in 2015 on September 21  the Armenian Independence Day.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

Delhi Food and Civil Supplies Minister Imran Hussain.Starting January 15, the 2,254 fair price shops (FPS) in the capital will be equipped with iris authentication for beneficiaries. This is an addition to the newly started Aadhaar card-based electronic point of sale (e-PoS) devices. While iris recognition will be implemented on January 15, authentication using one-time password (OTP) will be done at the FPS between January 15-20. This is a part of the trial, Delhis Food Supplies Minister Imran Hussain said.Iris and OTP methods will be used only if the first three attempts of fingerprint authentication through the e-PoS device fail. In the first eight days of e-PoS devices being installed at ration shops, many beneficiaries returned home empty-handed as either the machines didnt work or they failed to recognise their fingerprints.We were under the impression that the iris and OTP methods will be introduced at our shops from January 1, along with e-PoS devices its needed urgently because the machines have been malfunctioning a lot. We still havent received an order about the installation of iris authentication on January 15, said Saurabh Gupta, secretary of the Sarkari Ration Dealer Sangh.On Friday, billing at Rajender Guptas FPS in Hauz Khas was being done 500 metres away, on the road. The e-PoS device, equipped with two SIM cards, had connectivity issues. I waited for three-four customers to gather, walked with them till the road to use the machine, and then returned to the shop to hand over the rice and wheat. Its too hectic, said Gupta.It was a similar sight at an FPS in Krishna Nagar, Safdarjung Enclave, wherein Moolchand Gupta (52) had to borrow WiFi from a neighbouring shop. The machines have been supplied by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and its engineers have been visiting the shops for a few days now. I went to ration shops in Sheikh Sarai, Chirag Delhi, Greater Kailash, Kalkaji and Safdarjung Enclave to fix these machines. There have been many complaints. A lot of these shops are in areas with low network connectivity, said a BEL engineer on Friday evening.In Madanpur Khadars JJ colony, the FPS was shut over the weekend, as the machine had to be fixed. For Dhafli Bagriya (45), this meant a loss of wages. I have been standing in the queue for three days now. I cant afford wheat and rice from other shops, she said.

However, the decline in acreage has had its impact on seed production.Besides, he said, storage is a problem as pokkali seeds have to be processed with a keener eye as they are stored for almost a year after they are harvested.Pokkali season begins at the end of April and ends by about the month of October and the seed storage period is comparatively longer.Vyttila farmA senior agricultural scientist in Kochi said that farmers had traditionally relied on themselves for supply of pokkali seeds. The only dedicated seed production facility run by the government is at Vyttila where about two hectares are used for the purpose.As the facility produces only around five tonnes of seeds, farmers cannot get sufficient quantity of seeds. Shortage of seeds is often blamed for the shrinkage in pokkali acreage over the years.For an acre, 20-25 kg of seed is required.Coop bank initiativeIn view of the scarcity of seeds in Ernakulam, the Palliakkal Service Cooperative Bank plans to set aside the entire harvest from the last season for use as seed for the new season starting in June.Bank president M.O. Vijayan said that around 20 tonne harvested last season would be stored for use as seed considering the importance of maintaining the nature-friendly, organic way of cultivating the pokkali paddy.Repair of storage spacesMr. Vijayan said the bank took over the traditional araa (storage spaces or barns within dwelling units) available with individual families.The bank has spent money on repairing these storage spaces in order to keep the paddy ready for the next season.Along with original pokkali rice, the bank had also cultivated traditional varieties Ezhom and Orkkazhama from north Kerala, he said.He said that around 90 hectares, spread over two paddy collectives in Ezhikkara panchayat, were brought under pokkali cultivation last season.The pokkali cultivation was undertaken by the Ezhikkara Pokkali Karshaka Sangham.There are a total of 117 farmers engaged in pokkali cultivation under the banks initiative in various groups."

According to Backward Classes Welfare Department, about 2.5 lakh women above the age of 18 years got benefited from the marriage assistance schemes Kalyana Laxmi and Shaadi Mubarak which cover SC, ST, OBC and minority communities.

Clearing backlog has been a task, said a senior secretary.By March-2018 the departments will cover the backlog, the official said. Kalyana Laxmi is one of most successful schemes in the department, he added.However, some departments including Women and Child Welfare Department have spent over half the funds allocated to them, reaching about 45 percent of the intended beneficiaries.The department has been working alongside district welfare officers to attain efficiency, said Viziendira Boyi, Director Women and Child Welfare.A new scheme was launched in June, under which Rs. 12,000 is awarded to pregnant women with an additional incentive of Rs. 1,000 if the child is female."

The dealers, numbering about 25,000 in the State, had called for an agitation against the governments attitude of not paying commission in tune with the Act but it fizzled out following the pressure tactics adopted by the State government.Pressure tacticsAhead of the festival season, starting from Dasara, the FPS dealers planned an agitation demanding increase in the commission on sale of PDS commodities with a decision not to lift the stocks.However, the State government took the matter seriously and adopted pressure tactics to make the dealers toe its line with a warning that dealerships of those who fail to lift the stocks and supply them to beneficiaries during the festival season would be cancelled and new ones would be appointed in their place.It is understood that the dealers, who made good earnings allegedly by diverting the stocks not drawn by beneficiaries before the introduction electronic point of sale (e-PoS) system, have yielded under pressure and lifted stocks fearing loss of dealership.Not a burdenIn comparison to the expected savings of over Rs. 825 crore per annum with the introduction of e-PoS, commission payable to them even under the NFSA norms is small as it wont be more than Rs. 105 crore a year with Centre and State sharing the burden equally, sources in the Civil Supplies Department stated.It is reliably learnt that the Centre has already paid its share of Rs. 45 crore towards the payment of commission to fair price shop dealers at the rate of 70 paise per kg and the amount is lying in the bank.States shareThe State government is required to provide Rs. 60 crore, including Rs. 15 crore meant towards the commission for supply of rice (6 kg per head) in addition to the NFSA norms of 5 kg per person and also for the rice supplied to households given ration cards by relaxing the Central norms.Meanwhile, the Civil Supplies Department is gearing up to introduce 360 degree software to weed out duplicate entries of beneficiaries from the public distribution system and thus reduce burden further on the State government."

Hundreds of corporations vend food, indiscriminate consumption of which creates digestive disorders, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and even cancer.Processed and packaged food can be especially challenging to our health as these also contain, in addition to chemicals like fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, excessive amounts of sugar, salt and oil. Our government would outsource food to these corporations fully if left to themselves, instead of establishing ecosystems for family farmers to grow food without chemicals and undertaking the hard work of pushing and incentivising peasants to diversify their production from wheat and rice to a range of rapidly disappearing traditional foods (like millets) and more lentils, fruits and vegetables.Food processing to be major growth area: consumer choices to fuel change, says FM , read another media headline. Arun Jaitley has said the farm to kitchen chain is going to change in India, with increased agricultural production  and changing consumer preference. The consumer he refers to isnt the marginal and small peasant, the landless dalit, the adivasi in the forest or the urban poor.These corporations, with little interest in the health of consumers, are going to change preferences to more sugared beverages, more potato chips, more chocolates, more fried snacks. If outsourcing the change of consumer preferences to corporations isnt a recipe for a public health disaster, what is?Private Sector Must Invest More in Contract Farming: PM , announced yet another header. Companies are evaluating India as a market to sell their products and as an outsourcing hub.This is farcical in a nation where a vast proportion of the population is malnourished and nutritionally challenged. Prime Minister Modis speech was targeted at corporations and their ease of doing business with the consuming classes, and holds little hope for the poor. Each of these marks his unique approach to development where agency lies with mass-producing, machine-driven companies and entrepreneurs, not peasants and consumers.The purpose of development is forgotten. All political parties are complicit in equating development with GDP growth and FDI.Not much of this will reach the farmer in the form of higher procurement prices; much will instead flow to corporations as profits. Few new jobs will be created in heavily automated food-processing factories. By their very nature, global corporations will import sophisticated machines and labour-eliminating attitudes from their home economies to run these factories.Inequitable distributionNo small farmer will benefit; instead, already wealthy, large farmers in well-irrigated parts of prosperous regions of India will make money from these factories: the kinnow farmers in Punjab and potato farmers in Haryana. What is smothered by the development discourse is the critical issue of health sovereignty; we are ceding our rights to eat healthy, fresh, chemical-free, unprocessed foods to corporations.The urban, educated consumer demands organic retailers undergo stringent checks and penalties for misrepresentation, and rightly so. These same people, however, are eerily silent about the absence of labeling on 99.9% of all food today that is grown with overdoses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, preserved with chemicals, sugars, salts and fats. These hold no warning that consuming them over a lifetime will destroy our health.The larger picture is quite bleak with little hope of redemption; therefore, all the more reason that individuals must act for themselves.We and our children must beware of food or drink that comes in a package, and we must be mindful of who benefits from our purchases.We must ask difficult questions of a system that produces the chemically poisoned food we consume, and of a government that outsources public health to corporations who package and process unhealthy food.Finally, we must commence our very personal journey of discovery by engaging with a neighbourhood organic farm.(The writer, once a corporate warrior, is now an organic farmer)"

But today, with the machine, weve sold to only 100-150 people, he said.Nagina, 55, who works as a domestic help in Jasola, said, Ive been cleaning utensils for decades my finger tips dont have the lines, so the machine isnt recognising me.According to Food Supplies Minister, Imran Husain, Weve made it clear that no one will be denied ration. If the biometric machine does not work, entries are to be made in register For people whose biometric credentials are not being recognised, there is a system where they can file an affidavit and get ration through other family members. Any complaint of ration not being distributed will be taken seriously. We have also issued a helpline number  1967  where the complaints can be reported.Linking distribution of ration with Aadhaar cards was first started in 90 shops as a pilot project in December. Raju Guptas shop in the JJ Colony in Madanpur Khadar is one of them. He said, Weve been facing this problem from the start. We got the machine replaced yesterday, but even the new one is not working. We cant give ration manuallyweve written orders that state weve to ask people to come back on January 10.A circular by Food Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, dated December 28, 2017, states that in case authentication is not materialised through the e-PoS, FPS owner would be permitted to manually distribute SFA up to maximum of 8% of the total cards attached to the shop in case of any exigency of offline sale beyond 8%, a special officer shall be deployed at the shop. Another circular, dated December 30, 2017, from Food and Supplies Office, Circle-04, Adarsh Nagar, states that in case authentication is not materialised/successful the FPS holder should ask the card holder to come after January 10, 2018 so that satisfactory verification may be done.Saurav Gupta, secretary, Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealer Sangh, said in the last two days, he has received many calls from dealers complaining about confusion over the two circulars. They have launched the devices without any preparation, servers are down, some machines dont recognise biometrics and from shops in Kalkaji and Aya Nagar, I have received complaints about how the SIMs are not activated.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

They were stay put in various parts of the states.With the manual harvesting making use of traditional threshing tools such as threshing racks, simple treadle threshers and animals for trampling or by hand using sharp knives or sickles, given a go-by, the farmers now prefer machine reaping and machine threshing.The paddy harvesters are widely used in various states.The harvester combines all operations from paddy harvesting to rice extraction  cutting handling, threshing and cleaning.The combine harvesters using the services of specialised drivers and other farm workers can harvest an acre in an hour.Salem and Villupuram districts accounted for a large number of workforce who have specialised in using the combine harvesters.According to informed sources, Salem district accounted for more than 5,000 paddy harvesters employing about 50,000 workers  drivers, assistants, mechanics and middlemen.Due to recurring drought conditions, paddy crop failed in the Union Territory of Puducherry, and states of Andhra Pradesh, Telengana and Karnataka.Due to this, the paddy harvesters were lying idle throughout the season, rendering the entire workforce jobless. With the southern states receiving widespread rainfall, there was an increase in the paddy area.The workers took the harvesting machines to Andhra Pradesh and Telengana in September and were camping there since then.A majority of the workers and harvesting units have already returned to the district.According to K. Suresh, a driver employed with a harvesting unit, the paddy production has increased in both the states after a lull for two years. Thanks to good yield, the workers also got reasonable remuneration this season, he added.After over-hauling, the combine harvesters of Salem district will be proceeding for harvesting in the Cauvery delta districts."

A narrative of north versus south, them versus us, Centre versus states with splices of rationality riveted with rhetoric has come to occupy centre stage.Context crafts the contours of dissent, discord and discourse. The immediate provocation is the change in the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, set up to design devolution of funds to states. Population is and has been a determinant of allocation. Hitherto, Finance Commissions used the 1971 data. The 15th FC will use 2011 data. States with lower population assert that they will be shortchanged.On Thursday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan used Facebook and Twitter, no less, to state: Presently, Kerala receives only a paltry 25 paisa for every rupee of tax it contributes to the Union, Tamil Nadus benefit is a mere 40 and Karnataka gets only 47 paisa. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh receives `1.79 for every rupee they contribute. The new move will further aggravate this disparity.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, tagging the CMs of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Puducherry, tweeted: This will further affect the interests of the south: we need to resist. DMK leader M K Stalin charged the Centre with unilateralism and wrote to 10 CMs, including those of the south, Punjab, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, already in a face-off with the Centre, called out, There is nothing called Centres or States money. It is the taxpayers money. Southern states contribute the maximum tax revenue to the Centre, but they are diverting the money to the development of the north.Assertions aside, the actuality is that states with smaller populations and lower rates of growth in population could be affected. It is also true that use of data from 1971, when India had 54 crore people, in 2018, when the population is 131 crore, is irrational. Besides, population is only one of the factorsothers, including progress in moving towards a replacement rate of population growth, will deliver compensatory dividends.Political narratives are rarely linear. The southern states have delivered better outcomes and the anger is about the incentive structures and the lack of disincentives. The articulation and the underlying angst is less about who is getting more and more about how states that do less get more.In 1960, the government of India identified the 100 most backward districts. Over 80 of them were from the Hindi heartlandBihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Four decades later, a study on the 100 worst districts by this author found that laggards continued to lag. After much was said and done, little had changed. In 2001, a study by N J Kurian found that not a single district from Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh figured among the top 100 districts of India.It is true that the Constitution obliges governments to deliver a minimum level of public goods and services. Ergo population matters. But so does governance. Poor governance is best illustrated by the level of vacancies in the fields of education, health care and security. The largest numbers of teacher vacancies are in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The largest number of vacant posts for police personnel is in Uttar Pradesh. In Bihar, the hospital bed to population ratio is one bed per 8,681 persons. Bihar has 40,043 registered allopathic doctors for over 10 crore persons, Uttar Pradesh has 65,343 for over 20 crore people.Governance requires interventions, and some of the most transformative interventions have been in the south. It is, therefore, shocking to find Control or lack of it in incurring expenditure on populist measures among the terms of reference of the 15th FC. Fact is what is populist today most often than not becomes policy sooner or later.When M G Ramachandran introduced midday meals in Tamil Nadu in 1982, it was considered populist. It became policy in 1995. The 1983 two-rupee rice scheme of N T Rama Rao led to the National Food Security Act. The 1960s EGS was born south of the Vindhyas in Maharashtra, and became MGNREGS. Amma canteens are now sprouting in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, as are fair price medicine shops.The schism is not necessarily geographicit is about performers and non-performe0rs. On October 29, 2013, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi met the 14th Finance Commission and urged a paradigm shift in the approach. He argued that the Centre share 50 per cent of the divisible pool and that fiscal discipline, revenue collection and contribution to national growth be factored in for allocation. The argument is just as valid in 2018.Article 1 of the Constitution states, India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. This is us. That said, there is no mistaking the discontent bordering on alienation born out of a real and perceived sense of discrimination coloured by social, cultural, religious, political and economic interests. Perception is a high-octane volatile cocktail of facts, fancies, finger-pointing and frailties. Embedded therein are questions that demand dialogue, debate and a dtente of thoughts. To argue that much of it is political is to state the obvious. There is no politics without economics. shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

(Express photo) Bombay High Court. (Express photo)FIVE members of the Kokna tribal community have moved the Bombay High Court to oppose their rehabilitation from the Prajapur Pada in Aarey colony to SRA buildings. In the petition, the members have claimed that they are original inhabitants of the land and, hence, cannot be evicted for the Mumbai Metro III corridor.The petitioners from the Kokna tribal community have been cultivating for generations at the Prajapur Adivasi Pada. The petition, filed through lawyer Bhavana Mhatre, states that the families of the petitioners have been earning their livelihood by cultivating rice crops and vegetables on the adivasi land for decades even prior to 1952.The petitioners are seeking to challenge the eviction of tribals from their land for the execution of the Mumbai Metro III, Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ, in tribal areas of Prajapur Pada, Aarey Colony. The petition states that the tribals are facing constant threat of forceful eviction from their indigenous lands to give way to commercial projects, slum rehabilitation projects, hotels and resorts and film academies in Aarey colony.The petition further states that the Constitution of India provides them special provision to safeguard the welfare of tribals and tribal communities in India by protecting education, cultural, social, economic, political and employment rights. The petitioners are not only cultivating on that land but they also graze the land, tribals use water bodies, collect and dispose timber and non-timber minor forest produce in the forest of Aarey for generations.According to the petition, despite orders from the Bombay High Court that no action of eviction shall be taken against the tribals, three petitioners have been illegally evicted. They say the tribals want to be rehabilitated according to the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP) policy which gives a special status to indigenous people by providing them alternate land. But the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) conducted a survey and identified them as slum dwellers. The tribals inhabiting Prajapur Pada are traditional forest dwellers who have lived in the padas for ages and cannot be treated as slum dwellers, the petition says.The lawyer appearing for MMRC told court last week that notice was issued to the petitioners in May 2017, thereafter, the tenements were demolished and alternate accommodation is also provided to them. The matter will be heard next after the court vacation.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Jivya Soma Mashe was awarded the Padma Shri in 2011.NOTED WARLI artist Jivya Soma Mashe, who is credited with universalising the artform and broadening its scope from limitations of tribal ceremonies and rituals, passed away at the age of 84 in Ganjad village of Palghar district, Maharashtra, in the early hours of Tuesday.Mashe, who was awarded a Padma Shri award in 2011, had to his credit several national and international exhibitions, including solo and collaborations with artists of various genres. The artist is survived by his wife, three sons, two daughters and grandchildren. His eldest son, Sadashiv, is also a Warli artist. He was not suffering from any ailment but had become very weak. His appetite, too, had reduced and from the last few months. He had not been able to paint. A week ago, he told me that he wanted to paint a lot but was very sad that he could not. I have lost my father, who was also my guru, said Sadashiv.Rahul Sarang, the sub-divisional officer of Dahanu, said,Jivya Soma Mashe breathed his last at his home in Ganjad about 4 am. His last rites were performed with full government honours at 2.30 pm.Mashe, who had lost his mother at an early age, started assisting his father in painting Sadishiv said his father first had the chance to showcase his art when Bhaskar Kulkarni, a maverick artist from Mumbai, took Mashe to Delhi in 1973 for an exhibition at Pragati Maidan. Before that, and even some time after his first exhibition, Mashe worked as a labourer at a farm before taking up full-time painting.Traditionally done with rice paste on an earthen background, Mashe painted his Warlis on a cloth using permanent colours. Warli paintings display intricate scenes of tribal ceremonies, dances, hunting scenes and natural surroundings. Human figures, animals, insects and natural elements are drawn with lines, dots, triangles, circles and squares.Mashes first solo exhibition was held at Gallery Chemould in Mumbai in 1975 and his first international exhibition was held in France in 1976, which was followed by another major one in 1989. He had a joint exhibition with British artist Richard Long in Germany in 2003, and in Milan in 2004. These were followed by exhibitions in the US in 2006.Delhi-based art historian and curator Yashodhara Dalmia, who has written a book titled The Painted World of the Warlis (1988), said, Mashe was not only a talented artist who built himself up from nothing, he also had the vision to bring in modern consciousness into the art. He has left behind a great artistic thought. We see Warli art almost everywhere these days  on our walls, saris and many other things. The man who introduced the world to this art, lived a simple life and has left behind a great legacy. His contribution to the language of art is immense.In an interview to The Indian Express in 2013, Mashe had narrated the folk legend behind a painting depicting hundreds of ants in circular paths. This is a bhon. It is an ant dwelling. When Pralay (catastrophe) arrives, everything will be submerged and all the plants will be washed away. Then we will have to go to the ants as they store the seeds of all the plants in their bhon. The ants will help us farm and resume our lives. Our lives cannot be painted without the lives of animals, trees and insects, he had stated.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

According to data from the Palghar divisional office of the Water Resources Department, while 14,696 hectares of farmland was to be irrigated by the Kawdas and Dhamni dams, water will now be available for only 7,015 hectares.ADIVASI CULTIVATOR Bijla Lilka has made her peace with the fact that an irrigation dam built with funds from the Maharashtra governments tribal sub-plan submerged her paddy fields in Sava village, Palghar taluka, and led to her familys slow impoverishment. They had 25 acres of fragrant basmati, Bijla says. Then the dam was built, we lost our land, my sons had to work as daily wagers for years before we started cultivating 2 acres of forest land.Last year, under the Forest Rights Act, Bijla received the patta for her forest land, a now-meagre paddy field she irrigates with a pump in a stream of the Surya river. And now theyre saying hundreds of adivasis like me could lose our irrigation because the government wants to give this water to Mumbai?The Lilkas, belonging to the Malhar Koli tribe, are among hundreds of tribal families from nearly 50 villages in the Palghar and Dahanu talukas of Palghar district who have joined a movement to oppose a 403 MLD (million litres a day) water supply project by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority to provide water to Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayander, two rapidly growing satellite towns of the financial capital, already home to over 20 lakh people.The project is set to draw water from the Dhamni dam and the Kawdas pick-up weir across the Surya river, which were to have irrigated 14,696 hectares of farm land, an area that will reduce by 46 per cent if the MMRDAs project takes off, according to activists of the Surya Pani Bachav Sangharsh Samiti that has resisted the project through a hunger strike and multiple delegations to local officials, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and also to Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao.The anger among the 90 per cent tribal residents of this belt is on account of the fact that the dam, built originally for tribal farmlands and from funds meant for tribals, never met its stated objectives but will now supply water to Mumbais satellite towns 80 km away from the dam. According to data from the Palghar divisional office of the Water Resources Department, while 14,696 hectares of farmland was to be irrigated by the Kawdas and Dhamni dams, water will now be available for only 7,015 hectares. Also, while the department claims irrigation potential has been created for 12,490 hectares, locals disagree  theres a 13-km missing link in the main left bank canal, the minor canal network is overgrown with weeds in the absence of any maintenance for over a decade and lift irrigation schemes for farmland located higher than the canals were never built.The big cities thirst never ends, but how can the state government divert water for municipalities until the promised 14,696 hectares is irrigated? asks Prakash Hadal of Veti village who participated in a hunger strike in March outside the Palghar Collectors office.If the canals dry up, it would be insult added to injury, say those who were displaced in 1990. The rehabilitation of those whose homes and lands were submerged was messy, and in that process families ended up migrating repeatedly, looking for work on other peoples land or in the cities, says Hadal, Lilkas nephew. In Veti-Varoti, a group gram panchayat comprising 12 hamlets that with a 95 per cent tribal population, at least half the families now send out able-bodied people into nearby cities for summer employment. The promise of the Surya dam was irrigation  we should all be able to take a second crop every year. Instead, more and more residents are becoming slum dwellers in Vasai, says Shivram Kakad, sarpanch of Veti.Vikas Dokphode, 39, spends 12 to 15 days at a stretch in a large slum colony opposite a festering lake in Vasai, 70 km north of Mumbai. Then his rice stock runs out, and he spends Rs 200 to return home to Veti. We sell our rice for a maximum of Rs 8 or Rs 10 per kg. Buying rice in a city at Rs 40 per kg is unthinkable.As labourers, Vikas and his wife earn Rs 300 and Rs 250 per day respectively. Nearly half is spent daily on water, food and shelter in Vasai. If our land had been irrigated, I might be able to sow a second crop instead of going to Vasai, he mulls. A landless tribal, Vikas tills 1.5 acres of forest land, barely a couple of km from the Kawdas weir. He depends entirely on the monsoon for irrigation.The big city and its fringes where Palghars tribals find work for subsistence-level wages are seen as a many headed hydra  the pollution, the grisly living conditions in its slums, its out-of-reach prices of essentials and, above all, its insatiable appetite for water. Whether its the dam on Pinjal in Wada or Damanganga in Nashik district, water for Mumbais suburbs is set to come from farther and farther away. Its unsustainable, says Brian Lobo of the Kashtakari Sanghatana which is leading the tribals protests. And while infrastructure built for tribal lands is appropriated for the financial capitals growth, all sustainable water use practices and policies lie ignored, he adds.Despite villagers protests, the MMRDA says there is no cause to reconsider the water supply scheme. The water allocation by the state government is decided after a Cabinet sub-committee decision, says Additional Metropolitan Commissioner Sanjay Khandare. We are awaiting clearances from the Forest department and work would continue subsequently. He says while the tribal protestors are being heard by Palghar Collector Prashant Narnaware, there are as many or more people who have demanded the water supply scheme.The MMRDA seeking permission to build on forest land has run into opposition too  the projects purification centre is proposed on a 26 hectare plot of forest land that was already allotted to the Gram Panchayat of Veti as Community Forest Rights under the FRA. Any construction here, including for public projects, will require our consent as per law, says Veti resident Hadal. And we will not allow it.In Hanumannagar, a resettlement village where those displaced by the Dhamni dam were given land and homesteads, scores of residents land is not yet in their names, nor even in the name of the village. Sarpanch Bandu Umbarsadas own 7/12 extracts locates his land in the neighbouring village of Nevala, while a one-acre plot tilled by his brother Devu is shown as located in Shigaon. We are not opposed to giving water to Mumbai or Vasai-Virar, but we feel dismayed that so many issues related to our rehabilitation remain unresolved even 30 years later, he says. Many fields in Hanumannagar do not have access to the canals, and depend on wells and borewells.Back in Palghar, residents of the Dandekarpada and Sagpada hamlets scoff at the suggestion that drinking water supply takes primacy over water for irrigation and industry. Suffering an acute water shortage and dried up wells, residents of Dandekarpada have already written to the talathi seeking tanker water as the summer heat peaks.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

This is the land of the gullible, the once and future kingdom of Ramar Pillai.The political and economic news never fails to intrigue, enrage or baffle these days. And then theres the human story  the story of a pre-sapiens race. This week, its the bizarre account of over 30 people across north India being duped by a couple of snake oil salesmen who have moved up the value chain. The father-son duo cut their teeth selling allegedly medicinal snakes in Dehradun, for Rs 17 lakh. And then they realised that theres nothing like a bit of science to deliver the smoke and mirrors. Not the real thing. The mere trappings of science suffice to tantalise.A couple of radiation suits and hazard stickers were sufficient to part a businessman from Rs 1.43 crore, which the duo took to fund the development of a rice puller to harvest electricity from thunderbolts. Sounds plausible enough, with storm warnings every day. And remember, Benjamin Franklin did the exact same thing, only he used a kite and a key that cost a few cents. Presumably, the price tag goes up dramatically if the harvesting is done by people in radiation suits. And market sentiment rises if the rice puller is to be sold to Nasa through DRDO.Indian rationalists, despair. This is the land of the gullible, the once and future kingdom of Ramar Pillai. Remember the charlatan who cooked up hydrocarbons from herbal messes by the simple expedient of secreting some fuel in the stirrer? He had a bull run with the press, and even some scientists were prepared to look seriously at a man who was claiming to violate all the laws of thermodynamics. Fortunately, the rice puller has been stopped in its tracks before it could become a craze.

Although credit must accrue to the Congress for holding out against the constant disruptions that the BJP and its vigilantes have enacted in the state, their own strategies of relying on a plethora of populist welfare programmes (from free rice to dentures for the masses), has spawned grand promulgations of competitive populism in all the parties.In Karnatakas already tightly triangulated (Congress, BJP, and JDS) electoral race, the contestations and counter-contestations between the political parties have become louder and more ambitious. Political manifestos promise a dream list of good governance, and social media representations of political candidates draw on epic and film hero styles, and there is humour, spoof, and vulgarity between political competitors. But it is the speculation, as to who will be first past the post and what political chemistry and algebra of convenience will be drawn on to form a government, that has become the dominant narrative of Karnatakas assembly elections. Yet, beyond the promises, contestations and speculation lie a vast array of issues and concerns that have been rendered non-issues by both political parties and the society at large.Although credit must accrue to the Congress for holding out against the constant disruptions that the BJP and its vigilantes have enacted in the state, their own strategies of relying on a plethora of populist welfare programmes (from free rice to dentures for the masses), has spawned grand promulgations of competitive populism in all the parties. In addition, the Congresss identity affirmations (classic language status for Kannada, a Karnataka flag, a minority religion status for Lingayats), declarations of a Karnataka model of development as a challenge to the BJPs Gujarat model, and the proclamation of a Humanist Hinduism (against the BJPs Hindutva) are not recipes for a regional or national form of democracy that can address myriad economic and social issues.That the configurations of power in all the political parties continue to be based on an arithmetic of caste-capital and charisma, and defines who gets tickets but defies any expectations of seeking effective and honest candidates, is an indication of the distortions of democracy. The fact that most candidates have vast amounts of wealth, which has increased manifold if they were previously in power, and that all the parties have several tainted candidates is an indication of the submission of political organisations to sources of quick and vast funds. That the Reddy brothers of mining infamy can even come into the political foray (if not as candidates) and that people in Bellary do not see illegal mining as rapacious and devastating, are sad commentaries on the mindset of the people. Similarly, a generation of sons of leaders are now waiting in the political stacks of all the parties, indicating how leadership continues to be vested in family and caste interests.While the Congress has sought to draw on Keralas decentralised democracy and had initiated state-wide consultations on formulating a peoples plan for development (and is now represented in the New Karnakata 2025 Vision Document), the institutions of decentralised democracy, especially the panchayats and the nagar palikas, have been neglected. The failure to curb corruption and enhance the performance of bureaucracies is an issue that has not been raised at all and the performance of the key departments of education and health continue to be on a downward curve. The Congress governments inability to challenge the might of private medical practitioners and its continued support to the privatisation of healthcare defies its very manifesto and declarations of being pro-people. Similarly, the proclamations on enhancing educational opportunities are belied by the failure to address the rapid decline of Karnatakas state universities in which the seats of the vice-chancellors are themselves considered to be auctioned through the political-money nexus.Concerns that should have been central and which could focus on addressing climate change, decreasing land productivity, loss of agricultural land, extant ecological degradation, water and soil conservation, etc have not been raised or debated. Issues of drought management, which should be a key issue, as the state has the second largest tract of semi-arid lands in the country, have been given short shrift and the promotion of extractive agriculture and mining through the deployment of heavy machinery and technologies continues.Development and equity have been articulated either in terms of identity politics and the establishment of caste-based development missions and departments, especially for a number of backward caste groups, and has led to the growth of new boundaries between caste groups and to creating new tensions among them. Regional imbalance is best captured in the excessive attention that Brand Bangalore receives in terms of becoming a global destination for IT, BT and the new startups, versus the vast, neglected north-eastern hinterlands that are marked by ecological devastation, low agricultural productivity and high out-migration. The insidious seeping of Hindutva into the cultural lexicon of the people has been enhanced by the competitive religiosity that all the political parties are indulging in. And, only time will tell how the full implications of granting of separate and minority religion status to Lingayats will be played out.Matching the political parties oversight of key economic, ecological and social issues is a range of demands by different organisations that seek to fulfil narrow agendas and interests. The sugarcane farmers association seeks loan waivers and high support prices, agriculturists in the Cauvery belt refuse to share water with Tamil Nadu, the dominant castes sulk at the celebration of Tipu Sultan, and the late actor Vishnuvardhans fan club threatens to boycott the Congress for failing to allocate land for a memorial to the actor.Although several civil society organisations and groups of leading writers have come together to review the manifestos of political parties and to raise concerns about democracy, equity, and the well-being of people, their lack of political clout has meant that their inputs and advice have fallen on deaf political ears. Perhaps, the only movement that has raised larger issues is youth for jobs, which has now endorsed different candidates across different parties so as to realise its goals of promoting employment generation. The results of Karnatakas elections may mark the fortunes and historical trajectories of the contending political parties but they may not change the terms, logic, and patterns by which democracy is being articulated.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

JCP (Crime Branch) Alok Kumar identified the arrested accused as Virender Mohan Brar (56) and his son Nitin Mohan Brar (30).Police said they had recovered what the accused claimed were copper plates, anti-radiation suits, anti-radiation chemical stickers as well as a laptop, printer, foreign cheque books, fake ID cards and an Audi car from their possession.A few years ago, the complainant, Narender Saini, met Virender, who told him his company would sell the rice puller to NASA after building it. He said he needed seed money for this purpose, JCP Kumar said.Police said Virender told Saini that he would be paid Rs 10 crore as soon as tests for the equipment were successful. Saini entered into an MoU with Virender and paid Rs 87.2 lakh for anti-radiation suits, which the accused said would be worn by scientists during testing. They said tests were scheduled in Hapur, but could not be held as the place was not conducive. They also took him to an office in East of Kailash to convince him that he was not being conned, he said.The accused also roped in fake actors posing as DRDO officials, after giving them a salary of Rs 20,000, just to convince Saini about the authenticity of the equipment, DCP Bhisham Singh said, adding that the father-son duo were also arrested, and released on bail, earlier.They were earlier arrested when they allegedly sold snakes in Dehradun for Rs 17 lakh by claiming that the reptiles were rare and had medicinal properties. They were also arrested from Kurukshetra in a separate case, but resumed duping people once they came out, an official said.Police said they stayed in the posh Meera Bagh area at a rent of Rs 60,000 per month. They travelled in luxury cars with two personal security officers who carried weapons, at a salary of Rs 35,000. They wore branded clothes and sported expensive watches. With their confidence and fluent English, most people would not suspect them, an officer said, adding that they ran seven offices in Delhi.Virender ran a motor workshop in the 1990s and Nitin assisted him. But they faced financial losses and started duping people on the pretext of selling rare and antique objects such as magic mirror, rice puller and two-headed snakes, Kumar said. The arrest was made by a team of inspector Sunil Jain and ACP Aditya Gautam.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

(File) The Cauvery flows through a different world and different worlds within its world. (File)The government has been wise in not pressing the panic button on the Cauvery. In fact, the concept of a Cauvery Board is a flawed one. Lawyers normally have a limited understanding of water issues. We have a lot of experience in India of tribunals delaying projects for decades. Some experts have suggested highly centralised systems of dispute resolution and decision making. I dont have any in principle stand on centralisation versus decentralisation in dispute resolution on water. However, our experience in the Narmada and many other disputes have suggested that tribunals delay matters in a big way.My friend Nilanjan Ghosh said in a discussion on the persistent Cauvery problem that I favoured a decentralised approach towards a resolution by vesting more powers lower down. He described the history of the dispute and correctly stated the principles of water-sharing, now established in the Dublin Protocol. This system worked in the Mekong valley where nations at war were able to share water and provide for minimal flows in the post-monsoon period in the Tonle Sap. Also, upstream arrangements were suitably modified, including the scaling down of dams. This meant major changes in master plans as designed by the great Indian irrigation engineer, Kanwar Sain. Sain, after the Mekong, worked on the Rajasthan Canal Project.This Mekong experience-based system worked for many years with the Cauvery. The disputes were sorted out either by the irrigation engineers or by the state-level officials. In rare cases, it went to the CMs and PM level, where it was solved. This did not mean that everything was hunky dory. In water disputes in a resource-strained system, the best we can expect is that everybody will be roughly equally unhappy.This year, the second level has taken the call, but the disputes remain. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka then wanted the highest political levels  the state level and central political leadership  to resolve the issue. However, the Central government is not taking the call.Interestingly, nobody is talking about the complexity of the problem. When we look at farmers and rivers and irrigation, it is the North Indian problematic which dominates our mindset. The Cauvery flows through a different world and different worlds within its world. In the north, in the garden areas of the Coorg from where it originates you have, for example, plantation agriculture. We must be the only country where plantations can be just a few acres. I am not demeaning them. In fact, eating Mysore Pak and drinking fresh coffee in the highlands of Coorg is one of my ideas of heaven. But the Karnataka government did well to give a loan waiver to such agriculturists a few years ago, even if it was up to Rs 50,000. If you have not built up the markets in the highlands and if the Bharat sarkars e-markets are not working because price data is not there, then the loan waiver was justified. Though as a professional economist, I know that it chokes the credit line. It is what one would call the second-best measure. Now, of course, all political parties are offering huge loan waivers and we have to wait for the election results to see what will happen.In the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu, there is another world. You grow rice there. When the rains fail, since you have ignored the advice of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University and not diversified from paddy, you go to the great temples of the delta and the church and pray for help. So we go to the only Church in the world where lakhs of farmers, often women, pray for water. Then sometimes we go to Delhi to agitate.Lets be careful in setting up a dispute resolution mechanism. Lets do it with love and care. When civilisations disagree, dont be abrupt.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

India have pointed at rankings; Thailand at performances. In recent years, both India and Thailand have staked claim to be Asias fastest-improving team. India have pointed at rankings; Thailand at performances.Like India, football revolution in Thailand took place in the North Eastern part of the country. Unlike India, the Thais did something about it, and are reaping rich rewards.Away from the bustling streets and exotic nightlife of Bangkok, Buriram was once among the poorer provinces of Thailand. The locals were gifted footballers but they spent more time on the rice fields than the football fields, until a local politician, Newin Chidchob, bankrolled a team eight years ago. Today, Buriram United is not only the most successful club in Thailand but also among the best in the continent, routinely challenging the Chinese and Japanese teams in the Asian Champions League.When India meets Thailand in their Group A opener of the Asian Cup next year, half-a-dozen players in the squad are expected to be from Buriram United alone. They represent everything that Thai football is  young and confident, constantly punching above weight and challenging Asias best.When the draw for next years Asian Cup was held last week in Dubai, India were seen to be handed a rather favourable deal. They, after all, are the second-best team in the group going purely by FIFA ranking. India are expected to struggle against UAE and Bahrain as they always have.Thailand, though, could be an eye-opening contest. In the recent years, both India and Thailand have staked claim to be Asias fastest-improving team.India have pointed at rankings; Thailand at performances. However, it is widely held that the match could prove just how much India have fallen behind the rest of Asia in terms of development  tactical and technical. India captain Sunil Chhetri fears as much. Thailand is the most improved side in Asia in the last six years, Chhetri says. We played against Thailand in six-seven years ago and it was a 2-2 draw (India had actually lost 2-1). (Today) They are competing with the best in Asia. Australia and Japan are finding difficult to beat Thailand.This 53-second video (http://bit.ly/1LuI4Gr) is enough to get a glimpse of what India will be up against in Dubai. Its a clip from Thailands 3-0 win over Vietnam in 2015  the move starts in the 70th minute from the right, slowly at first. By the time the ball changes flank and enters the box through the centre, it gets frenetic.Continental forceThe speed at which the ball exchanges feet is blinding. Vietnamese stand as though hypnotised by the movement as the Thai players with dainty feet dance around them, scoring a goal that mutes 40,000 people in Hanoi. That they were toying like that with Vietnam, the other fast-improving side from the region, made it even more impressive and reaffirmed what many already believed  this Thai team was shedding its tag of being regional bullies and were emerging as a continental force.This was happening at a time when the Indian players were unable to string even three accurate passes, losing to sides like Guam as the rankings plummeted to an all-time low.Although Thailand have always held an edge over India, the gap was never this yawning. The last time when the two sides met, in a friendly in June 2010 at Delhis Ambedkar Stadium, Thailand earned a narrow 2-1 win. Despite the result, there was a semblance of equality in terms of the level.Both were bullish about their future, banking on restructured professional leagues that were launched around the same time in 2008.But India would trip on its own feet, first due to nearly three years of inactivity from 2011 to 2014 and then because of external forces meddling with an already fragile domestic structure.During this period, Thailand really zoomed ahead. Unlike India, who under the influence of IMG, adopted a top-down approach, the Thai FA went about things in a more conventional manner.Steve Darby, a former Thailand national team coach who later managed clubs in India, says the launch of Thai Premier League was the turnaround.The game has always produced talented players but since 2008 when the Thai Premier League was introduced, the game has took off. Money has flown into the game Darby, who has coached Mohun Bagan in I-League and Mumbai City in ISL, says. The biggest difference is that football is the number one sport, virtually no opposition  no cricket  and hence the media and sponsorship flows into the game.The clubs, owned by businessmen and politicians, have splurged money on foreign players. Like India, there have been instances of signing yesteryear stars but largely, they were smart buys  players like Brazils Diogo Santo (Buriram United) and Erik Paartalu (Muangthong United, now with Bengaluru FC), who had the experience of playing in competitive leagues.Conventional methodsThey didnt just spend on the players, the clubs have invested heavily in stadiums and training facilities too (so good the facilities are that even the ISL teams go there for pre-season). Because of the heavy sums involved, clubs often run into financial problems, according to Thai football expert Paul Murphy, making the league unstable.However, things are much better than they were 15 years ago, he adds.Today, the Thai Premier League is considered to be the best in South-East Asia and is the only league from the region to get a direct entry in the AFC Champions League, where the clubs have started to leave their mark by routinely making it beyond the group stage. The national team ultimately benefitted from this, with a certain Zico at the helm. Not the Brazilian legend, who was coaching FC Goa in the ISL at the time, but Kiatisuk Senamuang, fondly called Zico back home. Senamuang is to Thailand what Bhaichung Bhutia is to India. He was appointed the national teams manager in 2014 and masterminded a turnaround.Few understood Thai football like Senamuang did.A legend in his country, scoring 71 goals in 134 international appearances, he could convince the clubs to release players for longer durations for the national team and ensured the federation kept the team busy. He was also lucky to have several of Thailands finest ever players available. The best four are now playing their football abroad. Playmaker Chanathip Songkrasin, striker Teerasil Dangda and full-back Theerathon Bunmathan are all with J League sides, while goalkeeper Kawin Thamatchanan is with OHL Leuven in Belgium, Murphy says. (No Indian player currently plays abroad and from the current squad, just two have  Chhetri and goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu).Zico set the ball rolling for Thailands best World Cup qualifying campaign since 2002. Senamuang was sacked last year after it was felt the team was starting to stagnate. The Thai FA received a dozen applicants, including Dutch legend Frank Rijkaard, for the post. They eventually appointed Serbian Milovan Rajevac, who led Ghana to the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup.Under Rajevac, theyve only gotten stronger, although it may not reflect in the rankings. India overtook them in the charts last year by remaining unbeaten in 13 matches, by mostly playing against lower-ranked teams, Thailand went toe-to-toe against some of Asias top teams to test themselves.A team that used to lose by five goals to Saudi Arabia had narrowed the deficit to just one goal while Asian champions Australia were held to a 2-2 draw.The ambitions of the two teams can be gauged from the fact that when, before the draw took place, India approached Thailand for a friendly next month to prepare for the Asian Cup, the South East Asians snubbed the offer and instead chose to test themselves against heavyweights China.The clash in January will be unavoidable. A match that might prove whose boom real and who lives in a bubble.Head-to-HeadIndia (rank 97) head to head with Asian Cup opponents.vs UAE (rank: 81)Played: 11, Won: 2, Lost: 8, Draw: 1.vs Thailand (rank: 122)Played: 21, Won: 4, Lost: 11, Draw: 6vs Bahrain (rank:116)Played: 5, Won: 0, Lost: 4, Draws: 0For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

Pointing to the little kitchen, Jayshree says, Even in the worst of time when we have no money, we can still rely on the handful of paddy. We can still survive on rice porridge (rice boiled in water and peppered with salt), she says. Every month, I money-order Rs 1,000 to my husband.

(Representational Image) The price of petrol, pegged at Rs 82.48 a litre in Mumbai on Tuesday, has seen an increase for the past two months. (Representational Image)IN THE wake of rising diesel cost, goods transport associations have complained that it has increased the operation cost of ferrying goods. Representatives of associations said they might have to increase the cost of items supplied if they start incurring losses in transactions.On Tuesday, diesel prices in Mumbai were pegged at Rs 70.20 a litre. In the past two months, the price has increased by Rs 10 per litre, compared to the base fare of Rs 60, which transport associations said is affecting their businesses. Prices of supplies, however, have not been revised in a big way in the past two months, they said.Diesel constitutes almost 50 per cent of our direct cost and any hike in diesel prices will increase our costing. Since we are already working on meagre margins, we will be put to heavy losses if we do not pass the hike on to our customers. This will definitely impact the aam aadmi as costs of all items, including milk, fruits, vegetables, rice and wheat will go up, resulting in higher inflation, Ashok Goyal, a committee member of the Bombay Goods Transport Association and MD of BLR Logistiks company, that owns over 400 trucks.In Mumbai, the price of diesel is more than what it costs in other cities. The fuel costs Rs 67.05 per litre in Bengaluru, in New Delhi, it costs Rs 65.75, in Bhopal, the price is Rs 69.38 a litre. In Kolkata, it costs Rs 68.63 per litre.The government should reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel, thereby earning a lower revenue but at least easing some burden on the consumers. There should be revision of diesel and petrol prices, quarterly. The government must also look to bring petroleum products under the Goods and Service Tax (GST) ambit, Malkit Singh, the chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress, said.The price of petrol, pegged at Rs 82.48 a litre in Mumbai on Tuesday, has seen an increase for the past two months.Petrol associations agrees that the fuel must be brought under the GSTs ambit. Bringing petrol under GST will regulate the costs, putting a cap on its maximum prices. As commuters are increasingly affected by fuel costs, delay in its regulation will generate negative responses towards the government, Venkat Rao, the president of Mumbai Petrol Dealers Association, said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together in Wuhan in central Chinas Hubei Province. (AP photo) The Wuhan summit signals that they do not want to clash against each other through misunderstanding and miscalculation. PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk together in Wuhan in central Chinas Hubei Province. (AP photo)No matter how you do the sums, you cannot come up with an easy answer as to whether the Wuhan summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping has been a success or not.That is because, the outcome of this kind of a summit can only be determined not through the communiques and words, but action taken on the ground. Many things are not visible right now and will unfold on the ground in the coming months and years.Though, by pulling the rug under the feet of the Dalai Lama, assuring China that India will not militarily intervene in Maldives and refusing to have the Australians at the Malabar naval exercises, India has front-loaded some of its commitments. Just what the Chinese have committed themselves to is not clear.At this point, we can, however, say that the principal achievement of the meeting is to put the strategic communications between the two countries on a new track. While meetings between officials of the two countries take place regularly, the Wuhan summit has inaugurated a new era of diplomacy where the top leaders of India and China meet more frequently and find time to take up issues in much greater detail. What the summit has also accomplished is to show the world that China and India may have troubled relations, but their leaders also have the maturity to recognise when things are going out of hand and exercise political will to do something about it.The significance of the meeting lies in the regional and global situation. Both India and China have a long history of a disputed border. But now as they are rising economically and militarily, they are also rubbing against each other in their South Asian neighbourhood and the vast region stretching from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean.The Wuhan summit signals that they do not want to clash against each other through misunderstanding and miscalculation. At the same time they would not like to have their bilateral relationship be mediated by third countries like the US and neither would they like to have their relations with other countries whether it is the US or Pakistan  negatively impact on their own interaction.They are also living in a period when the worlds greatest power, the US, has a leader who is unpredictable and erratic. The Sino-Indian meeting is of import to the developing world as well which increasingly looks to them for guidance and example.The difficulties and challenges that the two sides confront lie in several important areas :First, the disputed border. Unless the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is clarified, as Modi suggested in 2015, it is difficult not to have periodic incidents like in Depsang in 2014 and Chumar in 2015. Also, there is no point in asking the Special Representatives designated to discuss the border issue, to intensify their work. Actually their work has finished. What is needed is action by the respective leaderships of China and India.Second, both sides need to urgently revitalise their peace keeping mechanisms on the border. They have layer upon layer of confidence building measures, yet, they are not available to avoid crises.Third, India and China need to resolve their problems on the economic front because the potential for their relationship is high, but the performance as of now is well below par. An immediate area of attention is in that of the trade balance which is heavily skewed against India. But many Indian products like pharmaceuticals, Information Technology products and non-basmati rice are blocked from the Chinese market. China needs to open up its markets to Indian goods.Fourth, terrorism emanating from Pakistan remains a problem for India. As a friend of Pakistan and an important military partner, India feels that China should do more to restrain Pakistan.Fifth, both sides must have a diplomatic mechanism through which they can discuss regional issues like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka. Building on the idea of a joint project in Afghanistan, the two sides should explore joint third-country projects in some of these countries.Sixth, there is need for the top leaderships to sensitise lower level officials and military personnel as to what they are trying to achieve. Unless the lower level officials implement the ideas, the high level meeting will be of no value.At the end of the day, the success of the Wuhan summit is in the outcome of short and long term considerations. The former relate to the election cycle in India and Modis need to ensure that his election prospects are not marred by Chinese activity along the LAC.But equally, there is a medium-to-longer-term interest in the two Asian giants learning to live with each other. Both are growing and dissonance in their relations can have consequences for the region and the world, and, of course, themselves.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

That there are many misconceptions encountered by travellers bound to India, mostly spread by the western media.Sahar Mohmoud Sobeah, Gihan Ali Gomaa, Nadia Ahmed, Shadia Ahmed, Gasser Rizk, Naglaa Youssef, Ahmed Moustafa, Mona Saad, and Fayek Fouad were from the land considered as the cradle of civilization, and they were part of a Rotary Friendship Exchange programme. They visited Vishakhapatnam, Anakapalle and Vijayawada during their week-long sojourn.Drink water only from a sealed bottle. Dont board a flight without getting vaccination as India is full of contagious diseases. These were some warnings their friends gave them when they embarked on the exchange programme to India.But the truth is something else. The potable water here is not only safe but also sweet. I am here without any vaccination and Im alive, says a smiling Gasser, a dentist, who stayed as a guest with Rotarian S.M. Sultan, a senior lawyer.Their stay in various parts of Andhra Pradesh helped them encounter the real India and several doubts were clarified. There is one thing common between Egypt and India  the traffic. Vizag traffic is as chaotic as at Cairo, they say in unison.The team had an aerial view of the Steel City and visited Kailasagiri, fishing harbour, submarine and the aircraft museum and enjoyed their free time lazing around the picturesque Ramakrishna Beach. The affable Egyptians visited Anakapalle and witnessed the preparation of jaggery. They were overawed by the involvement of women in the making of the sweeter.They distributed English dictionaries to the students of Kajipalem School and visited the Rotary eye hospital. However, the green paddy fields across the Godavari districts were something that have impressed the visitors enormously. It green all the way. The train journey to Eluru was a memorable one as we saw the pristine paddy fields spread across hundreds of acres on both sides providing the staple food, rice to the people, says Ms Mona, an architect.The five-hour long train journey from Vizag to Eluru also dismissed one more myth they carried with them when they visited India. We were told many nasty things about the railway journey. But the journey was nice not only comfortable but also hygienic, especially the bathrooms, says Ahmed Moustafa, an engineer.The friendly Egyptians made a visit to Undavalli caves, Berm Park and also climbed Kondapalli Fort and witnessed the toy making. The stay in Andhra Pradesh is a memorable and were able to see both the ancient and modern vignettes of this fabulous country, says team leader Sahar Mahmoud Sobeah, an assistant dean of libraries at the American University at Cairo, before catching flight to Delhi."

As far as the names of staffers who failed to check the embezzlement, are concerned, it is sure that there were supervisory lapses that paved the way for the embezzlement. In the investigation, it would be checked whether they were involved in the wrongdoings.The director said they would know the exact loss of the paddy on Thursday when the physical inquiry will conclude.A team of food department, led by additional director rice Amarjit Singh, was in Amritsar to investigate the shortfall. Singh said there are a large number of godowns owned by Veeru Mal, which were checked and it was found that 400 truckloads of paddy was missing.The said rice mills have also obtained a cash credit limit of Rs 200 crore from Punjab National Bank (PNB). It came to the notice of the bank officials and the food department after they found that the mills dont have the required stocks.PNB general manager PS Chauhan confirmed that the owner, who is now absconding, has taken Rs 200 crore cash credit limit and said, We are moving against the miller legally and will take possession of the property which has foodgrains and machinery as collateral.The bank officials on Monday also asked the Amritsar police and local administration to take control of the rice mills as their owner couldnt be found at the known addresses.Our directions were clear that a miller cant pledge the foodgrain stocks, but in this case he went against regulations. So, we are moving for an action against him, said a food department official, on condition of anonymity."

A peek over the low hanging walls shows women spreading rice in large courtyards. Looking beyond the industrial area, one gets a whiff of reality.A large part of the ward is riddled with cramped streets with little or no space to park vehicles. Of a total 45 streets, Chinthamani Main Road is an important connect. It leads to the outer ring road and is maintained by the Highways department. The ward has a population of almost 15,000, about 90% of whom live in tiny houses with just enough space to accommodate toilets. Of the eight community toilets, the one on Irulappan Kovil Street remains locked.The drainage system often gets choked and spews slime onto roads. The stormwater drains are stagnant with garbage and insects find their way into homes. K. Muniyamma says the creepy crawlies are almost members of the family now. It is evident that sewage continues to flow in the path of the Kiruthumal. A walk along the stretch shows layers of brightly coloured plastic inching closer to the river.

The hamlet is located on the southern side of the village, separated by the district highway that runs from Badami town to Guledgudda town. As a result, Thogunasi Thanda, where people form the nomadic Lamani tribe live, does not have a fair price shop and the residents do not have title deeds to the land they live on.We Lamanis have been living off the forests for generations but now we cant enter it because of those authorities, said Gangadhar Rathod, referring to the forest department. But now that our Thanda has been recognised as a village, we will not need to depend on anybody, we will get titles to our lands, he said.Badami is the second seat from where chief minister Siddaramiah is contesting, apart from Chamundeshwari in the southern part of the state.Thogunasi village has a population of 600 and locals say this decision could change the face of their village.Not only has the government notified the Thanda as a new village but the area where it is located, Guledgudda, has been notified as a new taluk. Along with the Anna Bhagya, this is the scheme that will benefit the oppressed castes the most, said Lokesh Kattimani, another resident of the Thanda, highlighting the state government scheme to provide seven kilograms of free rice a month per person for Below Poverty Line (BPL) households.For people of the village and the soon-to-be taluk, the fact that Siddaramaiah is contesting from the seat is an added bonus. We have to support those who work for us, Kattimani said.However, Siddaramaiah has a battle on his hands as he is pitted against B Sriramulu of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).And yet, the CM has other factors in his favour, especially the goodwill from the decision to recognise Lingayats as a minority religion. The move for a separate religion was backed by influential mutts in the region. The BJPs campaign is based on attacking this move as a means to divide society. Veeraiah, a local party worker and Lingayat, said there were many other issues that the area was facing. Was this the only worthwhile issue he found?Then there is Siddaramaiahs caste. According to a district administration official, of the 216,000 voters in the constituency, at least 45,000 belong to the backward Kuruba caste, to which the chief minister belongs. In fact, the sitting legislator, BB Chimmanakatti, is a Kuruba himself and is campaigning for Siddaramaiah.Another issue is that of sharing of the Mahadayi river water among Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Goa has objected to a water diversion project of Karnataka. Siddique Yakub Patil, who grows onions on his five-acre land, echoed the anger of farmers in the region when he said he would call on all the farmers in the region to vote NOTA. HT had reported earlier this year about farmers who had vowed to canvass for NOTA as they were fed up with the failure of the principal parties in addressing the Mahadayi issue. The noose is the only fate that waits farmers no matter who is elected in this state. All these politicians have made their money, where will they have the time or the inclination to solve our problem? Patil said."

Adityanath also directed the officials to hold camps to provide ration cards and gas connections within a week to all those who didnt have it. He also ordered officials to read out names of 136 beneficiaries figuring on the list of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.As soon as the chaupal commenced, the villagers unable to get their voice heard, broke the barrier and reached almost near the stage and started apprising Adityanath about their woes, largely pertaining to official apathy.The CM realizing the anguish of villagers called Pratapgarh district magistrate Shambhu Kumar along with chief development officer and district panchayat raj officer (DPRO) on stage and made them answer the complaints one by one. He questioned the DPRO as to why toilets were missing from houses and ordered for transferring money in account of beneficiers by tomorrow.He questioned DM as to why ration cards of villagers were not yet made and why panchayat level officials did not know the count of families residing in the village.Expressing annoyance Yogi Adityanath ordered holding of week-long special camps in every corner of the village and ensure enrolling of every genuine beneficiary residing in the village in different welfare schemes.He also warned that he would not leave the place on Tuesday morning after launching of School Chalo Abhiyaan without reviewing work of drinking water scheme in the village.Its a unique campaign to take the government to the doorstep of the villagers and address their concerns. It will help us create a New India that the PM has been talking of, an India that is strong and self reliant, UP BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey said.Adityanaths security had a tough time balancing between the chief ministers wish to allow access to villagers and ensuring that there was no security threat. Such village chaupals would continue. We would want to cover all the villages, interact with all of you, Adityanath was heard telling the villagers.Despite instructions from the chief ministers office to keep it simple, Dayaram Saroj, the Dalit lekhpal, made elaborate arrangements. Anticipating several people, Manju Devi, the lekhpals wife, started preparing for dinner from 4 pm even when Adityanaths chaupal hadnt even begun. The dinner comprised four types of vegetables, chapattis and rice with kheer for dessert. Adityanath praised the preparations before proceeding to upper secondary school campus for the night halt.Instructions have already been issued not to make any special arrangements like ACs for the chief minister, an aide of the chief minister said.Though the Gorakhnath temple of Gorakhpur of which Adityanath is the head priest annually organises samarasta bhoj or community feasts, this was only the second occasion since Adityanath dined with dalits after becoming the chief minister on March 19, the first being in June.That time the dinner at Dalit home had followed after caste violence in Saharanpur. This time it has come amid the likelihood of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party teaming up against the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Several Dalit MPs of the BJP too had raised questions on their partys handling of issues Dalits hold dear, including reservation for the Dalits.The chief minister is a monk. When he dines with Dalits, it helps convey the message about our intentions to build a casteless society, a local RSS leader said."

He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2012. However, he came out of jail on parole in 2013 and jumped the parole in that case.Raju was again arrested in 2014 in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act case.In 2016, he escaped from police custody while on way to court hearing from the Hoshiarpur jail to Mansa court with the help of his accomplices.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Alka Meena said, Accused Raju was wanted in nine cases involving snatching, loot, dacoity and kidnapping. The police team laid a trap to nab him based on a tip off with the CIA that Raju was conspiring to commit dacoity in Sirhind, said police.He tried to fled the spot and also fired at the police party but the CIA staff over powered him, said the SSP. During preliminary interrogation, he revealed his identity and confessed about his involvement in Sandeep Dhillons murder, said Meena.Raju had also kidnapped a rice miller from Bhikhi town and released him after getting a ransom of Rs 5 lakh in 2016. He and his accomplice had also looted Rs 6.5 lakh from a wine contractor in Bhudhlada, she said.She said after committing the crimes, he used to travel to Ajmer Sharif to hide and take shelter."

The unsold produce soon turned into heaps of rotten slush.Singh says he sold 40 quintals for Rs 2,306 to a local trader, meaning he got Rs 57.65 a quintal. It was the worst year as long as I can remember, he says.The potato crisis of 2017 had to do with a knee-jerk farm trade policy that tends to clamp down on exports at the slightest hint of rising consumer prices. In June 2014, to rein in potato prices, the government imposed a minimum export price on potatoes, put the commodity under the Essential Commodities Act and also allowed duty-free imports. This choked off exports and caused domestic prices to crash amid a potato glut of 48 million tonnes.To avoid such disasters, India is now looking to setup a national agriculture trade policy, similar to the countrys three-year foreign trade policies. The farm exports policy will be geared towards promoting exports rather than them being used as a tool to control domestic prices, a person familiar with the development said.Last month, the commerce ministry unveiled a draft national agriculture export policy in step with the governments target of doubling farmers incomes. It has sought to boost agricultural exports from $30 billion currently to nearly $60 billion by 2022.Consultations among stakeholders, including the agriculture ministry and the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), began this month. Key proposals include ensuring processed agricultural products and all organic produce will be free of export restrictions in future. The agriculture and food ministries will also identify food items which will be permanently free from export controls.The government may form a trade perspective over a 5-10 year period and undertake a mid-term review of agriculture trade policy... the official said.The agriculture ministry, along with APEDA, has identified 50 farm export clusters, the official said. The Centre will soon hold consultations with states to standardise taxes in local markets for export-oriented produce, he said. For instance, local market taxes vary widely for basmati rice, a key export commodity. It is 4% in Punjab and Haryana and 1.6% in Rajasthan. For pulses, the fees are 1% in Maharashtra and 2.5% in UP.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. Farm economist Ashok Gulati says knee-jerk export restrictions on food items to prevent domestic inflation have deprived farmers of higher prices in the global market. A paper by Gulati, Infosys chair professor and Shweta Saini, who works with policy think tank ICRIER, analysed 10-year data to show that Indias agri trade policy had a pro-consumer bias. The governments Doubling Farmers Income also says Indias exports policy does not promote agricultural trade but is mainly used to control prices in the domestic market. According to the new draft policy, a three-year ban on non-basmati rice exports during 2008-11 amid a rice glut led to a notional loss of $5.6 billion."

What is important in these latest discoveries is that we have found continuity in the progress of rural culture from a pre-historic era, said D. B Garnayak, superintending archaeologist of ASIs excavation branch in Bhubaneswar.Excavation carried out on 12 acres of land in the Jalalpur village has unearthed remnants of axe, adze, celts and thumbnail scrappers chiselled from stones, harpoons, point and stylus made of bones and potteries with marks of paintings.12 trenchesThe ASI teams have also come across a couple of circular wattle and daub structures, which were predominantly used by people to take shelter during the pre-Christian era, in 12 trenches being dug simultaneously.We will send carbon samples to the Inter-University Accelerator Centre (IUAC), New Delhi, and the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow, to ascertain their exact age. Once we get the exact age, it will be easier for us to analyse the rural settlement and its activities, Dr. Garnayak said.The ASI researcher, however, said the people here could not have lived in isolation and they could have had cultural and trade ties with other settlements in the Prachi Valley that had come up around the Prachi river, which gradually disappeared.Subsistence economyRich materials found from excavation sites indicate that the people had a subsistence economy and they largely relied on agriculture, fishing and hunting.ASI researchers assumed that the bones found on the site belonged to deer species and bovidae. Discovery of tortoise shell, dolphin and shark teeth and fish bones indicated that the settlement could have been closer to the sea coast. Some rice grains have also been detected.Further excavation is expected to throw light on whether there was cultural link with other settlements, what happened to settlements established around the Prachi river, and how it declined, they said."

Chandrasekhar Rao has proposed a hundred food processing units at the rate of at least one in each Assembly constituency of the 30 districts in the State.He asked officials to explore the means for Central funding to the food processing units. To encourage farm mechanisation, he ordered supply of plantation machines at 50 per cent subsidy in all mandals, a release said after Mr. Rao presided over a meeting to discuss welfare of farmers.The meeting, attended by Ministers, MPs and officials, also took up government programmes, free round-the-clock power supply to agriculture, supply of seed and fertilisers, irrigation projects, input subsidy to farmers and formation of coordination committees of farmers. Mr. Rao pressed the need for more ginning mills and formation of rice mills cluster due to the possibility of higher paddy cultivation in kharif on account of availability of plenty of rain water. The Ministers should initiate measures to form coordination committees of farmers at village, mandal and district levels. A State-level committee which would enjoy the position of a corporation would be headed by a higher official. Conferences of members of village, mandal and district committees should be organised in four corners of the State and a public meeting at the Parade grounds here after the State level committee was constituted, Mr. Rao said.Discussing the functions of the committees, he emphasised the need for mandal and village panels to interact on crop cultivation and ensuring minimum support price for farmers. The committees would regulate the arrival of agricultural produce at the market yards. Stocks for the market yards to handle on any given day should be shifted. The committees should purchase the material if the market yards could not absorb.The role of Marketing Federation (MARKFED) should be redefined in the backdrop of constitution of coordination committees.Mr. Rao announced the constitution of a Cabinet sub-committee with Mr Pocharam Srinivas Reddy (Agriculture), Mr. Eatala Rajender (Finance), Mr. T. Harish Rao (Marketing) and Mr. K.T. Rama Rao (Industries) as members to take steps to prevent food adulteration, encourage food processing industry and ensure MSP for farmers."

Yeddyurappa , who has just completed his 85-day pre-election tour of all the 224 Assembly constituencies, has said that if his party is voted to power, it will reopen all the cases related to alleged scams in the Congress dispensation that have got relief from the State investigation agencies. In an interview , Mr. Yeddyurappa, who is also the partys chief ministerial candidate, accused the Congress government of indulging in large-scale mismanagement in various sectors and welfare schemes, including the flagship scheme of Anna Bhagya.Excerpts from the interview.What was your experience and feedback of Parivarthana Yatra?It was the biggest political yatra in the State as 11,000 km were covered in 85 days. The yatra increased our confidence of winning a minimum of 125 seats, even if the elections are held today. The feedback we got is that people are fed-up with the Congress and that they want a change.How do you rate the performance of the Siddaramaiah government?There is complete mismanagement of government schemes and administration. On the one hand, the government talks of Anna Bhagya scheme as its flagship programme. But on the other, there are efforts to divert the rice meant for the scheme to black market. Officials have lost confidence in this dispensation and have been approaching me with complaints. We will inquire into all these issues if voted to power.What are your advantages as well as key challenges?The failures of the Siddaramaiah government on all key fronts, especially failure to provide drinking water and complete irrigation projects, and a series of scams are our advantages. The key challenge is selection of candidates, given the intense competition for ticket. We have already done a survey on winnability of candidates and we are going to have two more.The BJP organisation appears to be weak in Old Mysuru region. Is it possible to reach your target of winning 150 seats given this?Several strong candidates have been joining the party from the Old Mysuru region such as Mandya, Ramanagaram, Chamarajanagar, and Kolar. This will help us to make inroads.Some of your party leaders, including Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde and Pratap Simha, have issued controversial statements. Will this not affect your poll prospects?Anantkumar Hegde has already apologised in the Lok Sabha. We have already told him and Mr. Pratap Simha to be careful with their statements.BJP central leadership appears to have tied your hands and curtailed your freedom by taking over the entire organisational responsibility?It is not correct to say that. In fact, the central leadership has given me full freedom to execute responsibilities as party State unit president. It is looking into candidate selection as there is heavy competition.Some Congress leaders are saying that it is going to be Siddaramaiah vs Narendra Modi in the forthcoming elections rather than Siddaramaiah vs you?The Chief Minister does not have the capacity and merit to compare himself with the Prime Minister.How important is the Prime Ministers Bengaluru rally for the party?We are looking at the Prime Ministers rally to strengthen our ongoing poll campaign and bolster our spirits. We want prominent workers from all the booths to participate. We are expecting a minimum of 3.5 lakh people to attend the event.The failures of the Siddaramaiah government on all key fronts ... and a series of scams are our advantages."

In October, night temperatures fall drastically and it would lead to fall in yield, said Nek Singh, a paddy grower of Khokh village near Patiala.Who would compensate for the reduction in yield, he asked.On the other hand, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman Kahan Singh Pannu, who recommended to the government the postponement of paddy transplantation, said farmers fear was unfounded.Instead, we will save 24 lakh million litres of water, which farmers would have otherwise pumped out through 14 lakh tubewells in five days, he said.As per the figures of the Commission For Agriculture Costs And Prices, central body for fixation of minimum support prices, a kg of rice guzzles 3,367 litres of water. From 1,000 kg of paddy 666 kg of rice is shelled.Punjab government has asked growers to postpone transplantation by five days from June 15 to 20.Pannu said, The underground water crisis was deepening, as every year the water level is falling by 70 cm and farmers are well aware of it. He added, Any new decision of the government takes time to be implemented.However, Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of Bharatiya Kisan Union, said the paddy variety PUSA 44 grown by majority of farmers in state takes 130 days to ripen. If transplanted on June 20, the harvest will be delayed till late October when the climate for the crop is not appropriate. The farmers worry that the yield would fall drastically.Punjab Agricultural University vice-chancellor (V-C) BS Dhillon said the university has developed two short-duration, less water-consuming varieties. One of them is PR 126 which has four-week shorter growing span than PUSA 44. The other is PR 121 that has two-week shorter span than the commonly grown variety.Dhillon asked farmers to shift to new varieties as peak yield period of PUSA 44 variety was over. PUSA is a crop of 130 days.I think V-C saab need to be told that commission agents and state procurement agencies dont accept PR varieties, said Rajewal.Transplantation to be pushed to July 1The ultimate goal of the agricultural experts and the farm bodies is to push paddy transplantation to July 1, with the idea to conserve water. We are working on that, and will ultimately implement it, said Dhillon.Earlier in 2008, paddy transplantation was fixed on June 10 and at that time also Pannu as secretary, farmers commission, was behind the move. In 2014, as secretary (agriculture), he pushed for delaying sowing from June 10 to 15."

While Deve Gowda cousins seem to be fighting for tickets among themselves, chief Minister Siddaramaiah has repeatedly alleged that there is a secret pact between the BJP and the JD-S, here are some things that are happening in the poll-bound state:Discord brews among Gowda cousins?If there is a first family of Karnataka politics, it has be that of Vokkaliga strongman and former PM HD Deve Gowda of Janata Dal (Secular). Accused of being Appa  Makkala Paksha (party of father and children), Gowdas sons HD Kumaraswamy as well as HD Revanna are in politics. Both their wives are also involved in politics. To counter criticism of being a one-family centric party, Gowda had declared that only his two sons would contest from the family this time around.However, Revannas wife Bhavani wanted her son Prajwal to contest polls but he had to stick to his grandfathers diktat. Prajwal, who has clashed with his uncle Kumaraswamy, has been confined to campaigning in his fathers pocket borough.Deve Gowda has tried to make peace and promised the Hassan Lok Sabha seat. But there is competition at home. Nikhil, the son of Kumaraswamy, has been canvassing across the old Mysuru region. As the cousins try to carve out their spheres of influence it remains to be seen who will eventually inherit Gowdas and the JD(S) legacy.Antics of candidatesElection times means candidates and their supporters will do anything to attract attention, which they hope will translate into votes.Janata Dal (Secular)s Malavalli candidate K Annadani got himself bathed in milk by his supporters. Irrigation minister in the outgoing Siddaramaiah cabinet MB Patil, contesting from Babaleshwar, was presented a gold ring by a supporter. And one of the supporters of Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) Kanakagiri candidate Basavaraj Daddesugur presented him with 101 bags of rice.The common theme in most of these gestures is that the candidate is usually praised extravagantly by the supporter before the big surprise gesture of a gift is made.Most analysts say that milk baths, gold, and bags of rice are all part of stunts engineered by the candidates themselves. Some others go to extreme lengths to get attention.A Karnataka Janata Party candidate from Haveri even attempted suicide by taking sleeping pills after his symbol was changed from a coconut to a coconut tree.However, he was careful to do this in front of his supporters so they were able to immediately admit him to a hospital and publicise the grave injustice done to him.Charges and counter-charges galore as election draws nearChief Minister Siddaramaiah has repeatedly alleged that there is a covert pact between the BJP and JD(S) to defeat the Congress. As proof the CM said that former CM HD Kumaraswamy and BJP chief Amit Shah had met on a flight. He also promised to release a copy of their air tickets at a suitable time. Subsequently the alleged air tickets began to circulate on social media. To counter this, the JD(S) released what it said was proof that CM and MLA Zameer Ahmed who had defected from their party to join Congress, had travelled to Pakistan. The CM retorted that if he had travelled outside India, his passport would indicate it. The JD(S) replied that it had only released its proof to show how easy it was to manipulate tickets."

The Lesser Whistling Duck and (right) the Spot-billed Duck.Wayanad is perhaps known as a hotspot of forest birds. But the recently concluded Asian Waterfowl Census reveals that waterbirds are also at home here, thanks to two reservoirs set up in recent times.Ducks, cormorants and darters are coming back to its landscape after several decades, though in small numbers.The survey was organised by the Hume Centre for Ecology and Wildlife Biology here in association with the Social Forestry Division, Wayanad, and the NSS unit of the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Pookode.Forty species of waterbirds have been recorded in Wayanad including a few new additions. A little Pratincole has been sighted in the Banasura reservoir and Lesser Adjutant Stork was sighted at Golur in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS).More than 100 Lesser Whistling Duck has been spotted in the Karapuzha reservoir.The species was at risk of extinction after rice fields, a major wetland ecosystem of the district, had undergone drastic conversion to fields of banana and other crops. However, the shallow waterbodies in the Karapuzha reservoirs have now became a safe haven for the birds, C.K. Vishnudas, conservation biologist, Hume Centre, told The Hindu .Interesting species that were spotted during the survey were Spot-billed Duck, Cotton teal, Grey-headed Swamphen, Eurasian Moorhen, Eurasian Coot, Bronzed Winged Jacana and Pheasant-tailed Jacana.The number of birds had also increased compared to last year, Mr. Vishnudas, who coordinated the survey said, adding the large shallow waterbody of the Karapuzha reservoir also holds many water plants, creating a unique wetland ecosystem for many wildfowl to feed, reproduce and survive.The Golur and Ammavayal areas inside the sanctuary became a good waterbird zone after the relocation of settler farmers from the area, R.L. Ratheesh, an ornithologist, who led the survey said.We spotted Grey heron, Wooly-necked stork, Lesser adjutant, Little grebe, and Striated Heron in the waterbodies of the region, he said.Students from the College of Forestry, Thrissur, College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Pookode, and birdwatchers from across the State participated.N.T.

Varq, the landmark restaurant at The Taj Mahal Hotel, which is the go to place for gourmets who want to try the latest in Indian cuisine, is now bracing for a change. Its culinary journey which started from Haveli led to the transformation of how Indian food is prepared, presented and perceived. One of the first to hone the concept of pre-plated Indian food, Varq has contributed in reinvention of modern Indian gourmet dining.Celebrating ten years of its existence, it wants to attract new age patrons, who want a nice blend of taste and health in their food.At the media table, the eight-course lunch had an array of innovative offerings. And as always, taste of the food one has grown up eating came back to haunt. For Arun Sundararaj, Executive Chef, who grew up eating authentic Malayali cuisine in Kerala, it is an inspiration to do better each time he steps into the kitchen. Some of his dishes, including the wholesome North Indian tandoori dishes or even delectable Japanese ones have been tweaked to lend a Southern flavour with its aromatic spices.Therefore, it came as no surprise that the first dish of the meal was created keeping the international traveller in mind. In appearance, Rava upma sushi looked similar to the Japanese raw fish served at the adjoining Wasabi by Morimoto.Sushi with a twistBut the taste was dissimilar as the chef had given an interesting twist to it. It had varied flavours of curry leaves, spices and batter used in upma. It was wholesome as the rice was substituted by wheat. Semolina wheat, another healthier options, was also used.Describing Rava upma sushi as a distinct dish, Sundararaj said: As we all know upma is a staple food in Southern part of India and is usually consumed for breakfast, here I wanted to think of something more innovative. Hence it took the presentation and form of a sushi. For taste, it has flavours of pickle called gongura or sorrel leaf of Andhra Pradesh.The food was prepared keeping in mind the health conscious guest by using different varieties of grains like millets, barley, black rice, buck wheat and raagi flour. Healthier cooking techniques like dehydrating spices, vegetables and fruits were used.Every dish re-emphasised that appearances are deceptive. Drumstick soup was surely an appetiser; it looked like regular coffee except that it was prepared by cooking drumstick leaves and yellow lentils together with pepper corn and herbs like coriander root and curry leaves.Another innovation came in the form of Murg methi malai souffle. It was creamy chicken at its yummiest best. It was an amalgamation of avian meat and fenugreek, in which the taste of chicken was exceptional even though one had an apprehension of flavour of methi overpowering that of meat. Here, chicken was sobered down in the sense that it did not have robustness of the Mughlai variant but it was juicier, tender and was made with less chillies. It was indeed difficult to guess which region it originated from.Next came Achari haldi fish tikka; it certainly was for those with refined palette. Unlike its popular image, it was light on spices and the best part was the touch and go of organic turmeric pickle which made it all the more delectable.For me dish of the day was the duck confit, which had the right ingredients. As duck has taste of its own; there was no generous use of spices. And the portions were tender and just right for the main course. It was inspired by the cooking methodology of Syrian Christians of Kerala. It had the flavour of distinct flavour of cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, cloves and curry leaves.Explaining the process, Chef Sundararaj said: Firstly, the spices are boiled and then powdered, marinated with duck using coconut oil, ghee, cooking oil, ginger, green chilli. Kept overnight, they are cooked with shallots, curry leaves and powdered spices. It is very important to cook the duck on slow fire for three hours so as to soften the meat.The meal underlined that healthier options can go hand in hand with rich textures of Indian delicacies.It is very important to cook the duck on slow fire for three hours so as to soften the meatArun Sundararaj"

The bullet train project will bring speed and employment. It is human-friendly and eco-friendly, he said. Those who farm the lands that will be acquired to build the corridor are not so sure.The government has promised progress and development to the regions that will be connected by the bullet train, but there are concerns about what it means for small farmers who will give up their land for the project.Diva is 50km from Mumbai and 25km from Thane. With its proximity to Thane creek, the suburb is largely agricultural and best known for its paddy fields and fishing. For the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train to go according to plan, land must be acquired from 108 villages, including Agasan, Mathardi, Desai, Betawde and Dativali in Diva. Mathardi will be the most affected, with land acquisition plans demanding more than 10 hectares of this village. Agasan, Desai, Betawde and Dativali will lose two hectares each.On April 7, a group of 200 farmers from Diva met the district collector to talk about land compensation. The farmers said they are ready to sell their land, but they want more money than the government is offering.Bhagwan Dagdu Mali, 54, and his three brothers own around 12 acres of land in Diva. They grow paddy during monsoon, vegetables in other seasons and have built a small pond for breeding fish. In monsoon, we grow paddy on our farm while in other season we grow vegetables like okra, eggplant and chillies. We also have a small pond where breed fish, he said, adding that the family cultivates approximately 3,000 kg of rice every year. Mali, who dropped out of school after Class 9, said, If the land is taken away by the government, we will lose Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000 a month.Mali was one of the 200 farmers who on April 7, met the district collector over land compensation. The authorities estimate they will need approximately 13.5m wide space for laying tracks and 4m wide for a service road. Sudam Pardesi sub-divisional officer of the district, said, We have not yet started the joint measurement survey for the bullet train project. Thus, the land which will be acquired is not finalised. The survey numbers are those which fall on the route of the bullet train. We will begin the joint measurement survey in next 15 to 20 days.While the district has promised twice the ready reckoner rate, the farmers want four times that amount. Ready reckoner rates in Diva price one square foot at Rs 5000. The government has offered Rs 12,500 per square foot, but the farmers have demanded Rs 20,000 per square foot, which is on par with land rates in Mumbai. The farmers also want a guarantee that one member of every family that loses land to the project will be given a job.Chintamani Munde, 48, owns seven to eight guntha (about one fourth of an acre). He said, We have demanded that the compensation be on a par with ready reckoner rates in Mumbai or other urban areas as the rates in Diva are very low. He pointed out that by selling their land, farmers like him are losing their livelihood. Once the bullet train passes through the village, the demographics of the place will change, said Munde, who is illiterate. The remaining land will also gradually become useless for farming, he said.Farmers like Munde and Mali have seen how urbanization impacts them and their land. Today, new housing societies tower over the villages old neighbourhood with sloping roofs and narrow bylanes. These multi-storeyed buildings were constructed in the mid-2000s. After they were built, locals say saline creek water flooded the farm land and affected productivity. Anant Mhatre, 50, said, We have around 4.5 acres of land behind Lodha Palava Project. Till 2005, we used to produce more than 1,000 kgs of rice. Since the flooding, they produce only 500 kgs of rice, he said.On April 12, a delegate of Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) visited the area to survey the land. The Mhatre family panicked because a marker was left on their farm land. We know that since it is a government project we will have to give our land, but we should be compensated properly, said 70-year-old Laxmi Mhatre, who is Anants mother.With the bullet train expected to open to the public on August 15, 2022, land acquisition has to be completed by December 2018 as per the projects timetable. The authorities claim the process has already begun. We cannot give a specific time line for the aquisition process as it will take place with the consent of the farmers. We have started conducting meeeting with the project affected at present. Only with the consent and satisfaction of these people we will be going ahead. This can take few months, said Pardesi.The farmers in Diva are not opposed to handing over their land, but theyre acutely aware that they will lose their way of life by doing so. Barkubai Munde, 65, of Agasan village, worried about the future that awaits them. Our farmland will be taken away by the bullet train project. It will leave us out of job and no home. No one has bothered to ask us. We are ordered to give away everything we have, she said."
5b1399039855b762ecebd903,Breakfast at Tirreta’s,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/breakfast-at-tirretas/article22647960.ece,2018-02-04,"To dine on authentic Chinese fare on a Sunday morning, the go-to place is Tirreta Bazaar in Kolkata. The mini-Chinatown, off the Central Avenue, reflects the heritage of Chinese immigrants in the city, which was home to nearly 20,000 of them in the early 19th century. The number has dwindled to 2,000 now, and some among them whip up the breakfast.The aroma of soup noodles, warm dumplings and fish ball soup from the stalls fill the air inside the lanes as the bazaar springs to life around 6.30 a.m. Men and women sit on stools and cook food as a stream of visitors come there to relish this unique street food. One of the popular dishes is the steamed bao , a soft Chinese bun with a variety of fillings. Another is the fish ball soup. De-boned fish is ground into a paste and mixed with corn starch and salt. The mixture is made into balls that are deep-fried and served with piping hot stock. The menu includes lope yang , which are rounds of savouries stuffed with radish; momos or dumplings with beef, pork, chicken, seafood or vegetable filling; and sweet snacks such as chintoy , which is a sticky rice dumpling topped with white sesame seeds.Suchitra Chakraborty, 67, retired Professor of Bengali literature, recalls the Sundays 50 years ago when she would visit the breakfast market with her classmates of Presidency College. Even now we go there on Sunday mornings to get a taste of our favourite breakfast dishes. The place exudes an old world charm and reminds us of our college days. My favourite is the fish ball soup and the prawn pappad, she says.The food is lapped up quickly, and the bazaar winds up by 9 a.m. It offers a peep into the life of Chinese immigrants. From students and young professionals to middle-aged men and women and Chinese settlers, the market attracts an eclectic mix. Its exact origin is unclear. Most stall owners say it has been around since the time of their great-grandfathers  it means about a century."

Chile has approved coconut fibre and walnut. South Korea and Malaysia too have agreed to buy Indian mangoes. Equador is the latest country to clear Indian rice.Read | IMD forecast of normal monsoon may temper economic, political risksAccording to a new farm export framework thats in the works, the government is looking to moderate its strategy of placing frequent restrictions on agri-exports to tame domestic consumer prices.The plan is to curb commodity exports only in extreme situations and to boost farm income from trade. The government has promised to double farm incomes by 2022.Agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh recently tweeted about increasing the value of agricultural exports to $100 billion by 2022-23. The Dalwai Committee Report on doubling farmers incomes also talks about freeing up farm exports.Indias agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This however fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. The countrys net exports (i.e. exports minus imports or the agricultural trade surplus) fell to $7.8 billion in 2016-17.Read | Why a normal monsoon is crucial for Indian economy, 2019 general electionIn 2016-17, marine products, meat and rice together made up 52% of Indias agri-export basket. India also exports spices, cotton, fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar, coffee, groundnut, oilmeals and cashews, which together with marine items, rice and meat comprised over 80% of the agri-export basket in 2016-17. According to farm economist Ashok Gulati, in farm exports, the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies which he says must be addressed.New export hubs for horticultural produce  fresh fruits and vegetables  are being opened in smaller cities as part of the strategy to provide direct global access to local farmers. Trial shipments were recently sent from Varanasi and Guwahati. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, in association with our ministry, has identified 70 districts as potential export hubs, agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said.Shipments to Dubai from Varanasi contained chilli from Uttar Pradesh. Pineapples were sent from Guwahati and oranges from Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. Both Varanasi and Guwahati now have complete infrastructure for exports, including phytosanitary certification.In a boost for mango exports, the US has agreed to transfer requirements of pre-shipment inspection to Indian plant quarantine authorities starting in 2019. The US has also agreed to bear the cost of inspection of mango shipments by US personnel, which will bring down the cost of exports, an agriculture ministry official said."
5b139fd29855b762ecebdc7d,'Adopt a Heritage' Is Not a Sell-Out,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/why-the-adopt-a-heritage-scheme-is-not-a-sell-out-the-facktivist-by-shekhar-gupta/story-QxDjij2s5Ko5pAIngjOx7L.html,2018-05-02,"In the past, we described a passing fad as flavour of the fortnight. In frenetic new digital India, it is the flavour of 48 hours. As is the ongoing outrage over the Modi government handing over the nations pride, the Red Fort, to a rapacious Marwari business house. A little bit of research confirms seven principles of todays polarised debate:1) Nobody wants to be confused by facts: so nobody checks facts. Read up everything written taking apart the idea of handing over national heritage to companies. They all tell you the government is hiding the details. That this whole thing is pick-and-choose, arbitrary and that be prepared for your monuments to be branded: Dalmia Red Fort, Tata Taj Mahal and, who knows, Wipro Chittorgarh.Nationalist outrage is a most contagious virus and I also caught it initially. Then my reporters scepticism kicked in and I made some checks. The lazy thing would have been to call tourism minister KJ Alphons. But I work late nights so I Googled instead. It took me to the tourism ministry website which, in turn, directed me to www.adoptaheritage.in. It has details of the scheme of involving companies as Monument Mitras in the running of chosen Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) monuments.About a hundred monuments are listed for adoption. These are listed in three categories, from premium (green) to the less coveted (blue and orange). A corporate bidding for a green monument (Red Fort, Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri, Chittorgarh) has to also take one out of the other two. The website gives more details than one would usually expect from the government. It says 323 applications have been received, four approved, and provides a step-by-step guide on how to apply. All the supposedly hidden, dark and diabolical secrets are here. I can spare Alphons a phone call.2) No political party has the monopoly on a convenient memory, if not unthinking stupidity: The Congress has been attacking this policy as a sell-out. If angry Congressmen had only bothered to make a phone call, not to NDAs tourism ministers, but to one from their own times, Ambika Soni, they wouldnt be looking so silly.In 2007, I recorded a Walk the Talk for NDTV at the Taj Mahal and she told me about the struggles she was having with the low-level bureaucracy in her own ASI who were sabotaging the wonderful work the Tatas were doing restoring the monument. You want more details, check out Kaveree Bamzai in India Today, on how a few ASI people went to the Supreme Court, asking if it approved the changes the Tatas were making. Because, they said, the court was responsible for the entire Taj complex. C. Babu Rajiv, a wonderfully committed ASI chief tried to save the situation but failed. The Tatas pulled out after sinking Rs 2 crore and wasting much time of the worlds finest restoration experts, including Sir Bernard Fieldon and Milo Beach. So, Manish Tiwari, please do exchange notes with Ambika Soni on this.3) Politics was more decent until a decade ago: Partly its because the older politicians were more civilised but mostly because Twitter wasnt invented then. The scheme of involving corporates in running the big national monuments was launched in 2001 by the Vajpayee government. Ananth Kumar and Ratan Tata had posed for pictures together at the Taj Mahal to celebrate the handing over. The Congress simply continued the good idea from the predecessor it had defeated. Any such thing possible now?4) The Indian Left-libertarian loves the government: They want government out of their own lives entirely; mention Aadhaar and they jump. But everywhere else, they love to have the Bharat Sarkar and the same bureaucracy they keep cursing. Why should culture, history and archaeology be the monopoly of the state? Why cant private capital, enterprise and efficiency get involved? Surely, they have no problems cadging sponsorships from the same evil corporates for their lit-fests, generous wine and cheese laden evenings, gifts, travel grants, track-2, social sciences conferences (all paid for by sponsors). The intellectual-liberal community lives on handouts from Ford, McArthur, Rockefeller, Bill and Melinda Gates and our own Tatas and other such corporations for funding scholarships, conferences, new universities and even independent new media. All thats kosher because it is coming to us, the deserving. Talk Red Fort and it is, watan ki aabru khatre mein hai, hoshiar ho jao (national prestige is at stake, so battle stations). Ask the angry ones the last time they went to Red Fort since probably their school bussed them there, sucking at lollipops.5) Too many in the complaining elites havent been to their monuments lately: or they would have known the mess the ASI has made of them. Open defecation may have been stopped elsewhere but most monuments, including Hampi and Mamallapuram, are open-air toilets. Their walls have love-notes scribbled, sometimes with a knife. Walk on the bridge on the beautiful Betwa river bouncing through boulders, facing the stunning old temples of Orchha early in the morning and soak in the sightsbut avoid the smells please. The ASI drove piles through the Sun Temple in Konark, the Army built barracks in the Red Fort, and my colleague Rama Lakshmi, a trained museologist, tells me about the tiny museum in Nalanda with one bored chowkidar, dusty glass cases, cobwebs, peeling walls. There is a 12th century artifact on display there, she says, which is a tiny bowl with rice grains. The text label to it simply says, burnt rice. It is the description for a powerful artifact from the 12th century. If Indias elite were going to their own monuments more often, they would also be complaining about the lack of facilities, no souvenir-economics: good quality mugs, caps, key-chains, replicas, nothing like a my mom went to Ajanta and all she got me was this lousy T-shirt. Nothing. Our monuments are run like CPWD properties.6) They do see monuments overseas but miss some facts: Italy has the largest number of Unesco Heritage Sites in the world. Cash-strapped, its government has been handing these out to corporations, mostly the fashion brands, for restoration and upkeep in return for branding opportunities. Tods has the Colosseum, Diesel the Rialto Bridge in Venice. When you go to the Trevi Fountain next, look for the logo of Fendi and also Pradas at Venices big palace. I know, it isnt smart to mention Italian wisdom in India at this point. But it should be for the BJP-walas to complain, not their (mostly Left) liberal critics.7) And finally, for the last twist of the knife. Many critics point out the dangers of giving great monuments to the Dalmias given that one of that complicated and large familys uncles was charged in the Babri demolition. Since they also seem to love swadeshi Archaeological Survey of India and government-run museums, they should meet the current director-general of the National Museum in the capital, Dr Buddha Rashmi Mani. This retired additional director-general of ASI got the job in 2016 until the age of 70, or further orders.Dr Manis claim to fame: He led the excavations at Ayodhya that proved the existence of the Ram Temple underneath.This article has been updated to correct the position occupied by Dr Buddha Rashmi Mani. The error is regretted."
