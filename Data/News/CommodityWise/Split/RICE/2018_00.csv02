Punjab University AC Joshi Library is a treasure house of rare documents which are being preserved through digitisation.About 1,492 manuscripts, 50% donated to PU and others purchased on various occasions, are being currently digitised (photographed and numbered to be electronically processed) currently with support from the National Archives of India.Around 1,200 manuscripts have been digitised till date. Others are not in a good condition and cannot be processed, says Mritunjay Kumar, assistant archivist of the library.The collectionsApart from the Bhagavad Gita written with a rice grain, the library boasts of another copy of the Gita, eleventh skanda (chapter), written in Gurmukhi, among other religious texts.Many of these manuscripts, says Kumar, are from a time when religious texts were being translated from one script to another by scholars keen to learn about different religions. One can find out more about the history of such scripts as the manuscripts were written in Gurmukhi which used words in continuity, without space as used in Urdu.For preservation, manuscripts and the rare books go through four steps: fumigation, de-acidification to remove spots; lamination of pages as per archival terms and finally is digitisation. (Anil Dayal/HT)Mahabharata in PersianThe library also has a copy of Mahabharata translated in Persian by Shri Vias Devgi Maharaj, in Nastaliq (Arabic script developed sometime during the 15th century). Dating back to the 17th century, it has vibrant illustrations by Iranian painters on Hindu culture, even Krishna. It was bought from one Prithipal Singh of Amritsar in 1956.Sharing a fascinating fact, Kumar says during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, whose passion for the arts led to various scriptures being translated into Persian and illustrated, snakeskin was added to the paper as it was thought to be a great preservative.National Archives of India funds processes to digitise manuscripts, depending on the need. Every year we get Rs 10 Lakh for this purpose. It can also sanction Rs 1crore for a separate archival building, which we had applied for in 2015, as the PU library is the richest in north India in terms of manuscripts, Kumar adds.Regular visitors to the archival sections of the library include students from the humanities departments, some researching the manuscripts. Other visitors include researchers from the UK, USA, Canada and even the Arab countries who come to look at the manuscripts.The library also has Jauhar-al-Tarkeeh a book on prosody (pattern and rhythm of poetry) and syntax of Persian, and ancient writings on Vedanta among nearly 400 manuscripts donated by former vice chancellor Dewan Anand Kumar. It also has around 20,000 rare books which include Mutiny records, education reports from the colonial era and a complete digitised collection of Ruchi Ram Sahni, freedom fighter and educationist.A catalogue with details of all its books in three languages is also maintained by the library.Treating and preserving manuscriptsFor preservation and treatment, the manuscripts and the rare books go through four steps. The first step is fumigation or heat treatment in which books are exposed to temperatures of 58 degree Celsius for 24 hours to destroy book lice and worms. The process is carried out at the Government Museum and Art Gallery, Sector 10. The second step is to de-acidify the books to remove spots. The third step is laminating the pages as per archival terms which increases the life of the book up to 100 years. The fourth and last step is digitisation."

SINGARAVELOUT_SingaravelouPuducherry Municipality has started inserting microchips in pet dogs. The initiative is aimed at curbing the practice of owners from abandoning their pets and creating a database of domestic animals.The municipality has acquired 300 chips for the pilot project and started implanting microchips in the canines a few days ago.Unique IDThe microchip, the size of a rice grain, will be implanted under the skin of the animal between its neck and shoulder blades by using a syringe. The chip contains a unique identification number that can be tracked by an electronic reader, said K. Coumarane, Veterinary Medical Officer of the Puducherry Municipality.Although there are 2,000 pet dogs in the city, only 1,000 have been registered. The civic body aims to cover all the dogs under the programme and to vaccinate them.Under the first phase, microchips would be implanted in 300 dogs.The owners have to pay Rs. 150 for licence and Rs. 200 for the microchips. The municipality has inserted microchips in 50 canines so far.The abandoning of pet dogs by owners is the most cited reason by the municipal authorities for the spurt in the number of strays. The authorities say it is difficult to trace the owner of a dog that has been abandoned on the street.The municipality has planned to identity such owners and fix responsibility, including impose fines on them, Mr. Coumarane said.Data bankThe alphanumerical microchips would help the authorities maintain information about the dog, including its age, details of anti-rabies vaccination, owners name, address and telephone number.The unique identity numbers embedded in the chips would stay with the animal for the rest of its life. The chip cannot be duplicated.At present, the municipality issues metal badges while granting licence to owners of pet dogs."

Around 150 farmers from Ghodbunder Road, who will lose their land for this plant, have now opposed the project, claiming that it will displace them from their rightful farm lands. The corporation will be acquiring 28 hectares (70 acres) of farmland for this desalination plant which had earlier faced resistance from the opposition party.The farmers had visited the town planning department of the TMC for a hearing on Wednesday. They claimed that the Waghbil to Gaimukh stretch is the only stretch in Thane where red rice is cultivated and displacing the farmers will wipe out the paddy fields.Thane city receives 480mld water every day from TMCs own water supply scheme, along with contribution from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and Shahad-Temghar Water Supply Authority (STEM). Taking into consideration the increasing population of the city, this water will be insufficient in the future. In 2016, Thane civic commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal had proposed desalinating the creek water and using it for potable purposes. The plant will be able to provide 200mld of water on a daily basis.Sagar Patil, one of the farmers whose land is affected said, We got notices in the month of April, stating that our land will be acquired for the project and to put forth any suggestion and objections we have within a month. There are around 150 farmers whose total 70 acres of land will be acquired by the corporation. The said land was barren land, which the state government gave to us for cultivation. Each of the farmers own at least one acre of land in this stretch. The state gave us the land in the 1960s, which we are cultivating till now.Patil said that the last of the remaining paddy fields in Thane city are in Waghbil, Kavesar, Ovala, Mogharpada and Gaimukh areas.While the fields do not produce much crop, we produce enough to fulfil our year-long requirement. If the corporation acquires the land, the all these paddy fields from the state will vanish. Moreover we will also lose our land. The corporation has not given any clarity as to the compensation. We should be compensated appropriately if they are adamant on taking away our farms, said Pritesh Patil, another farmer.The TMC had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a private agency last year and are in need of a place near the creek to set up the plant. We chose a 28-hectre reserved plot at Kavesar. The area is reserved as a recreational plot; however, we had tabled a proposal to change the reservation from recreational to desalination plant, in July last year. The general body approved the proposal. Out of the 28 hectares, 22 hectares were supposed to be used to set up the plant, while the remaining area will be used for the development of the waterfront, building an access road and laying of pipeline, a TMC official said.He added that though the plot is now used for cultivation by the farmers, it is still owned by the state. The state is the prime owner of the plot and has the right to change the reservation. We can also send a proposal to the state to de-reserve the plot. However, we will not let any of the farmers suffer, we will come up with a policy that will give them Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) which will benefit them, he added.(OLD Graphics)About the plantTo ease the water woes of the city, the corporation proposed in June, 2016 that it will desalinatethe creek water and use it for drinking purpose. The projects will be set up on a public private participation basis where the corporation will not have to shell out money. The city has a vast coastline, the creek water is unexplored. This kind ofdesalinationhappens in countries like Japan, Australia, China, North Africa and European countries. In India the plants are set up in Gujarat and Chennai. The corporation plans to use the same technology in Thane.The treatment plan will treat 200 mld of creek water every day. Thane Municipal Corporation will be the first in the state to implement this. TMC has signed the MoU with Fontus Desalia Water Pvt Ltd ten days ago. Work will begin after monsoon and the project will be completed in the next two years.The need for thedesalinationplantThe city receives 480 mld of water from four sources. However, this summer due to last years scanty rainfall, the water available was merely 314 mld, imposing a water cut of over 40% in the city. The corporation tried many ways of conserving water including rain water harvesting and water recycling, however, the issue was not resolved. The residents had to face a shutdown of 48 to 60 hours. Thedesalinationprocess will make an additional source of water available for usage.How it worksThe plant will be based on reverse osmosis technology, commonly referred to as RO, which is a water purification process that uses a semipermeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from the water.The corporation will spend Rs15 lakh to hire consultants for the project.TMC will also provide the land and bear the power cost of the project, the remaining expenses will be incurred by the agency allotted the work.The company will be responsible to ensure that the potable water fulfils all the required water quality criteria. This water will be connected to the distribution system of the corporation.The company can sell the water to the corporation at the rates finalised by the corporation, the company can also sell few bottled water to remove the maintenance expense of the plant.Waterper day: 480mldWatersources:TMCs ownwatersupplyscheme (watersource: Bhatsa Dam): 200mldBrihanmumbai Municipal Corporation(watersource: Bhatsa and Tansa Dam): 60mldMaharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) (watersource: Barvi Dam): 110mldShahad- TemgharWaterSupplyAuthority (STEM) (watersource: Barvi Dam): 110mld--"

Narayanasamy were seen in an animated conversation where both converged to garland the statue of Mahatma Gandhi on the Beach Road.This sense of conviviality or at least the public display of it, was in stark contrast to what happened on last October 2 at the same venue when both Ms. Bedi and Mr. Narayanasamy even failed acknowledge each other.On Tuesday, the Chief Minister greeted her on her arrival at the Gandhi statue and both were seen conversing. In a surprise and rather sudden decision, the entire Cabinet, along with legislators, had attended the Republic Day reception a few days after the Chief Minister had even threatened to complain to the President if Ms. Bedi continued with her style of functioning.The move to reduce strains in the relationship was being mooted from within the ruling establishment for sometime, especially after popular schemes such as the monthly distribution of free rice started getting disrupted due to the tug of war between the Lt Governor and government, a government source said.Any disruption in the welfare scheme will hurt us politically as it happened to the N.R. Congress government. Going for a rapprochement does not mean that we are going to give away the rights of an elected government, said a party leader.The decision to attend the reception was taken after the Chief Minister held a series of meetings with Ministers and MLAs, said a party legislator.At the death anniversary, Ms. Bedi, Mr. Narayanasamy, Speaker V. Vaithilingam, Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam, Deputy Speaker V.P. Sivakolundhu and Parliamentary Secretary to Chief Minister K. Lakshminarayanan garlanded the statue of Mahatma Gandhi.

As a result of 3,957 hectares of mangroves being deforested between 2000 and 2015, India ranked eighth worldwide for the amount of carbon stock loss.However, since India has been effective in its efforts to curtail mangrove deforestation, it is also among the top 20 for the amount of soil carbon storage in mangrove forests globally.Carbon stock refers to the amount of carbon stored in the forest ecosystem. It helps mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases, which lead to global warming and climate change. Soil carbon  the amount of carbon stored in soil  is the basis of fertility.A study by USA-based think tank Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC), used satellite (30-meter resolution) remote sensing data to estimate soil carbon emissions.Our analysis revealed that soil carbon stored in mangrove forests across the world holds more than 6.4 billion tonnes of carbon globally, which is about 4.5 times the amount of carbon emitted by the US economy in one year, said Jon Sanderman, lead author of the study and associate scientist at WHRC.According to the India State of Forest Report 2017 compiled by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), mangrove cover in India was calculated at 4,92,100 hectares, which 0.15% of the countrys geographical area. FSI estimated soil carbon stock for mangrove forests in India to be 3,979 million tonnes. Overall, carbon stock from all forests in India is 7,082 million tonnes.Loss of soil carbon depends on how the land is used. Sanderman said, Deforestation due to wood harvesting or conversion to rice will results in much lower losses of the soil carbon than conversion to shrimp aquaculture or draining, filling for urban development.In India, the study found that soil carbon storage in mangrove forests varied dramatically depending upon location.The Sundarbans in West Bengal have very low soil carbon stocks primarily due to the fact that there is high sediment input from the Ganges River system. A similar system is observed along the west coast of India. Whereas, mangroves down the coast in Tamil Nadu, such as the Pichavaram mangroves, contain almost four times as much carbon in a given hectare of forest due to low sediment deposition, said Sanderman."

Of the 125 lakh tonnes of wheat procured in the state during the current season so far, 65 lakh tonnes are being stored in the open.In technical terms, it is called covered at plinths (CAP) storage, which is a great cause of concern for the state government. The wheat stored in open is exposed to the vagaries of weather, and has shorter life. But what makes it worse are the piling up stocks of grains.There are 25 lakh tonnes of wheat of the previous season and officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the central body that runs nationwide public distribution system, say the state will have a backlog of wheat of one full season (at least 125 lakh tonnes), hinting at tougher days ahead for the states food and civil supplies department.Besides, some more wheat of the current season is expected to arrive in the mandis. The state godowns also have 100 lakh tonnes of rice.Must read | Tomato prices crash in Punjab, Haryana due to bulk suppliesState procurement agencies have witnessed the second highest arrival of wheat this year after 2012-13 when 130 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured. Officials of state food agencies said such a pile-up in the CAP storage was not witnessed for the past five years.Another worrying factor is the fall in the monthly movement of foodgrains (wheat and rice) from the state, from an average of 18 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2016-17) to 15 lakh tonnes in the (2017-18) current year.Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are no longer consumer states and they have become self-sufficient in foodgrains. Also, Madhya Pradesh is now contributing to the national pool, said an FCI official, on the condition of anonymity.Besides, Haryana is expected to contribute additional 10 lakh tonned of foodgrains into national kitty this year (a total of 85 lakh tonnes as against 75 lakh tonnes in the previous year), which will cut down the demand for Punjab wheat, he added.Punjab has a covered storage space (godowns) capacity of 152 lakh tonnes for both rice and wheat, and 4.75 lakh tonne capacity in steel silos for wheat storage. This entire space is already full, according to officials.We are prevailing upon the FCI to make movement of foodgrains faster. If the quality of grains gets affected due to CAP storage, Punjab will be at a loss, said state principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha.The FCI official suggested that the state could easily store 30 lakh tonnes of freshly procured wheat in CAP storage to save covered storage space, as it would cut infrastructure cost to one-third.30 lakh tonnes of wheat kept from April to September in CAP storage would move out easily, he said."

The room is warm and muggy, and her face glistens with flushed longing. Sweat drips in little rivulets down the spine, as her lips surround the plump tip in a moist viscous exploration of mouth and tongue. She had been waiting nearly for a year for his arrival, and now that hes here, their union is about to explode and erupt into the most seismic frenzy of golden, luscious, sweetness. Her lips engulf the taut, juicy fruit. Shes finally bitten into her first mango of the season.Waiting for the mango season to arrive has been a ritual of anticipation way before Katrina Kaif seduced us with her unique and voluptuous handling of the fruit. In Mumbai, by February, people usually start discussing how much the first mango is expected to cost.No one is talking dozens at that time, just one fruit. By February end, the big fruit shops unwrap their boxes, unfold the tissue paper and prominently display small quantities of the fruit. You will never see the shop full of mangoes. There will be only a box or two and the phalwallah charging a premium.Its end February or March and about 600 dozen Alphonso mangoes arrive from Ratnagiri and Deogad. Street value of Rs 175 a piece or Rs 1,900 a dozen. Ive been to Devgad. Their economy is mangoes and the fruit straight off the tree is pure nectar.There is a mad rush to the shops and like most things that are in demand in India, the King of Fruit too is rationed out.Its now that psychology kicks in. Our brains are genetically wired to seek social status, and this desire triggers activity in the reward network of the brain. I must have it first, before everyone else, whatever be the price. So that I can put up pictures on social media and serve freshly cut fruit at the next party I host.I have a little more patience. For me, mango season starts when the Gujju thali joints in Kalbadevi add amras-poori to their menus and when Natural announces that their Fresh Mango Ice-Cream is ready.Im no longer a big fan of Natural, I find their ice-creams a bit powdery and watery now. But their Fresh Mango is a goopy fantasy. Hand-churned, creamy, and glorious. Every spoonful scoops up chunks of real mango, not just pulp.Theres a mad rush for those first batches of mangoes. Everyone wants to have pictures to post on Instagram.Bachelorrs at Chowpatty and Haji Ali Juice Centre suddenly get more crowded, with street side waiters whooshing aluminum trays from car to car, balancing mugs of Fresh Mango Milk Shake and oversized bowls of Fresh Mangoes with Cream.Then its amras-poori time. Its actually an odd combination. Chilled sweet fruit pulp eaten with hot, deep-fried savoury pooris? But someone back in the day decided it was an auspicious kinship, and it works.My advice, go to either Thackers at Chowpatty or Shree Thaker Bhojanalay and order the thali. Skip the bhakras, phulkas, puran polis, rice, khichdi and all other forms of carbohydrates. Just let them fill your platter with the farsaan, vegetables, daals and pooris. At least half a dozen pooris to start with. One big katori of amras and then dip the poori in amras and hit your high notes.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.Restaurants and patisseries too will start their mango extravaganzas.

This price would be very remunerative to the farmers and they can directly handover the paddy without the involvement of middlemen.Ms. Rohini said that to enable the farmers to market their farm produce at their doorstep, the TNCSC has also introduced a mobile DPC, which would serve the farmers of the entire district.The farmers can contact the mobile numbers 98429 09595, 94437 74431 for using this facility.A team of officials, on receiving information over phone, would visit the places of the farmers and collect the paddy.S.

Im talking about the intricate web of lanes running from the square opposite the Venetian Gothic-styled David Sassoon library behind Rampart Row all the way to Flora Fountain on one end and Horniman Circle at the other.For what its worth, Kala Ghoda was always a hub for culture and art. Flanked by a museum, many art galleries, a foreign cultural mission, a historical synagogue and erstwhile home to two of Mumbais iconic restaurants. Samovar, tucked inside the Jehangir art gallery, and Wayside Inn, wrapped around the corner next to Rhythm House.Wayside Inn was epochal because it was at Table No 4 that Babasaheb Ambedkar, over hours of passionate persuasions and pots of tea, drafted the Indian Constitution. Its here that struggling progressive artists Husain, Ara and Gaitonde scrounged for toast and eggs, and poets like Arun Kolatkar wrote verses about life, jam and bread. Here that Mohammed Ali Jinnah romanced his Parsi girlfriend over dhansak, and Behram Contractor created his memorable humour column alongside sunny-side-up eggs and bacon. And where a whole generation of post-Independence socialists and intellectuals was bred, over custard and bread pudding.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. All the fun is now inside the lanes. (HT File Photo)I used to love sitting there, watching the rain fall and the brown trees go green, over a mug of beer and plate of mixed grill and onions.Rampart Row used to be a street full of happening restaurants. Wayside Inn has given way to Punjab Grill. Khyber looks a bit lost. Copper Chimney has shifted three buildings to the left, and right above it is Boston Butt. But all the fun is now inside the lanes.It all started with Kala Ghoda Caf. From a small sky-lit space that could seat, at the most, six people and offered free wi-fi, its turned into one of the most influential eateries in that precinct. Its cavernous hall and Bombay black wood furniture are reminiscent of a large dining room in an old Mumbai mansion.At The Pantry, ingredients come from artisanal makers all over India. The Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere alone is worth the visit. (HT File Photo)The menu is eclectic. Fourteen types of coffee, from macchiato to affogato. Ten kinds of egg, from the Parsi tamota par eedu (eggs on tomato) to omelettes with bacon and feta. There are also three kinds of waffles, two kinds of porridge and muesli. Its an ideal breakfast place. But lunch isnt bad either. You can pick between sandwiches, soups and sali boti, or try the Karnataka black rice risotto with mushrooms.Just off Ropewalk Lane is The Pantry. White, bright and cheerful, they source their ingredients from artisanal makers all over India. Their cheese for example comes from Pondicherry and the Quiche Lorraine they do with oodles of cream Gruyere and ham alone is worth the visit.La Folie is a stylish patisserie. The tiny place looks like a chocolate box itself, with small desserts lined up like little works of art, but its the hot chocolate that takes me there.At Ayub's, the meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery. To me, its the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. (HT File Photo)Then theres Nutcracker, a vegetarian place thats cracked the code. Penne, pesto, panini, potato wedges, with peach and ginger iced tea. But the Emmenthal scrambled eggs with truffle oil, and the Mumbai Local sandwich hit the spot for me.A little further away is Plenty. Its not exactly Kala Ghoda, but a short walk towards Horniman Circle. Brick-walled and poignantly coloured, the menu is a mixed bag of all our favourite dishes that remarkably bear an overall demeanour of goodness and health. Even the usually oily, spicy and vinegary Goa sausage, when served alongside a portion of fresh avocado, pickled beetroot and goats cheese on a crisp slice of healthy toast, tastes wonderfully refined here.They have cold bowls and they have hot bowls and the hot bowl I like is the Kerala pepper chicken stew with steamed rice. But my favourite is the pulled pork sandwich  sweet and spicy pork between freshly baked bread. The finale has to be the berry pavlova, meringues in sour berry compote with vanilla cream, lime and pistachio.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.As the office rush recedes and the lanes empty out, as young couples walk hand in hand in the lanes of Kala Ghoda looking for love, and as revelers hunt for a wine, a beer and a song, I am often spotted looking for a hot spicy egg roll, stuffed with boti kebab. Walk past the aqua-coloured Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue and at the end of VB Gandhi Marg (VB Gandhi is the man who decided that Mumbai cabs should be black and yellow) burns a late night fire. And that fire is from Ayubs.Ayubs the Michelin star version of Bade Miyan. The meat is better, the onions fresher, the chutney less watery and the rolls less soggy. Hot seekh kebab or boti kebab rolls in soft roomali roti, with crunchy onions and chutney. Thats Kala Ghoda for me as well.But the weather right now is too muggy and oppressive to eat hot spicy rolls. Ill wait for the rain to come and wash the streets and trees of Kala Ghoda, because at the moment SoBos Soho stands for So Bloody Hot."

Abba means father. These words came from Kenny Ng, a dentist from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He was here for the 48 hours of Feel the Jail experience at the old jail located in the headquarters of Sangareddy district, Telangana. He learnt the two words from jail officer Sailu, who closely monitored him and his friend.The experience was unique. I dont think it is available anywhere in the world except Sangareddy. Though there are some museum jails, you cannot stay there, said Mr. Kenny, who spent two days in the jail along with friend Kelvin Ong, a restaurant owner.They came to the jail on Saturday and were released on Monday at noon. Each paid Rs. 500 a day to experience the jail life.On the first day, they had lunch that was supplied to other prisoners who had come from the Kandi district jail to work. They had chapati and rice with curry for lunch and dinner. On Sunday, they had a breakfast of lemon rice and, on Monday, fried rice.It was total confinement and we were out of touch with the world. We generally sleep on a bed with a cushion.In jail, it was different. We had to sleep on the plain surface spreading the blanket given by the officers. There was no pillow. It was disturbed sleep ... frequently getting up and trying to sleep. We had a fan, said Mr. Kenny. He said he would share his good experience with his friends back home. They were interested in learning about the jail experience, he said.Both Mr. Kenny and Mr. Kelvin were given a warm send-off by the jail officials after they completed the formalities.Feel the Jail concept was introduced in September 2016. So far, the jail had as many as 47 visitors, including the two foreigners, seven women, a retired army personnel and an assistant commercial tax officer."

This would mean that around APL beneficiaries will get food grains at subsidised rates. State food and civil supplies minister Girish Bapat announced the decision on Monday.By linking the Aadhaar cards with ration cards, the state government succeeded in getting rid of around 10-12% bogus ration holders. As a result, the food and civil supplies department is saving more than 3 lakh metric tonnes of food grains every year. Considering this, the government has now decided to include the APL beneficiaries who were discontinued by the state government, said the food and civil supplies minister.However, despite the decision, a whopping 78 lakh people would still remain out of the NFSA benefits. The state government had taken a similar decision in January 2014, but could not implement it.Out of the 8.77 crore ration card holders in the state, around 7 crore ration card holders avail benefits for those under Below Poverty Line (BPL) category and Antodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) scheme. They get wheat at 2 per kg and rice at 3 per kg under the NFSA.The rest of the 1.77 crore APL card holders were also getting same benefits during the erstwhile Congress-NCP government at the state expenses but was discontinued after BJP took over in 2014.The decision was challenged in the Bombay High Court in the form of Public Interest Litigation (PIL).In December 2014, the court had asked the state government to reconsider its decision. Following court directives, the state government in January 2016 had decided to include APL beneficiaries saying the decision will be implemented once seeding of Aadhar with ration cards is completed. The exercise was undertaken to eliminate bogus ration card holders."

I am an ordinary tea seller and in my wildest dreams I never thought that Modiji would praise me. Yesterday, he had invited me and the children of my school before his public meeting at Baliyatra ground in Cuttack. During our 18-minute meeting, he enquired about my school like a family member. He seemed to be tense before the meeting, but he looked relaxed after meeting all of us, said Rao.During my visit to Cuttack yesterday, I was delighted to meet D. Prakash Rao and some of the students whose life he is transforming. #MannKiBaat pic.twitter.com/31VCbOGmBX  Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 27, 2018A school dropout himself, Rao started the school Asha O Ashwasana in 2000 when he saw kids in his neighbourhood taking to petty crimes or becoming alcoholics. In the 1960s when his father, a World War II veteran, started a tea shop in Cuttack he encouraged Rao to help him. Raos father thought schools were waste of time and never encouraged his son to attend school.Rankled by the memories of his incomplete education, he started the school in 2000, but found the parents unwilling as that would have meant loss of one working member. After much persuasion, they agreed and the school today has classes till Class 3, after which the students take admission in other schools. Rao also feeds milk and biscuits to the kids as midday meal from his own income apart from giving them school uniform and chappal.Raos wife is a nurse in the SCB Medical College and Hospital who sustains the family with her income while a major part of his own income from the tea stall is spent on the school.Apart from his school, Rao is also a well known blood donor. Till date, he has donated blood 214 times and platelets seven times. Rao took to blood donation when he suffered from paralysis in 1976. When he recovered after spending six months in hospital, he learnt that someone had donated blood to save his life. He started donating blood in 1978.During Saturdays meeting with Rao, Modi asked the kids to sing and then promised one of them that he would come back to have rice and dalma with him. Rao said if the PM gets time, he would make a hot cup of tea for him. The tea binds us together, he said."

But, I dont know why a lot of you keep asking me not to mention your name while discussing the topic. Dont be so humble now, learn from me. Isnt it cool to see your name published in a national daily, eh, Varun? So what if it is in the context of you wanting to pee outside your neighbour Anil Sharmas front door in Lajpat Nagar each morning, because hes such a pain over parking? Youve done it only thrice, as you clarify, but see the brighter side, youve now become famous. Youre most welcome. I already know about my optimistic, good nature.Anyway, this week, I got a mail from 19-year-old Vivek Oberoi from Indore who is depressed. Hawww, it just struck me that people may be writing fake names in their letters to me. Or maybe not.Anyway, around six months back, Vivek moved to Delhi for higher studies. And he hates every minute of the six months he has spent in this self-centered city so far. His words, not mine. People in big cities are unfriendly towards those from smaller towns. I really feel out of place. I had so many friends back home in Indore, theres so much warmth when I call them every day. I hate it here, feel like crying, he says.READ | A Calmer You, by Sonal Kalra: If you are over 30, write a willDekho Vivek, I can totally understand your problem, but have you thought about what you may have done, unintentionally, for people to become unfriendly? Like tell them your name. You know Im just joking, dont you? I genuinely love all Vivek Oberois in this world.Coming back to your problem, what Ive gathered from a lot of things you have written about yourself in your mail which I will not share here, because, you know, Im fiercely protective of peoples privacy I think you are a fairly nice, well-mannered and sincere guy. Generally, people of all cities love those qualities. And although I completely agree with you about a sickening bias some people have against those whove migrated from relatively smaller cities, I would like to believe that most Delhiites are not like that.And this problem of not being able to adjust is not specific to Delhi. A lot of people, who are having to live away from their native place because of studies or work or any other reason, often feel anxious and stressed while missing home. Its very natural to. But what makes the situation worse is their tendency to let this I-miss-home feeling keep them from embracing the new place in the true spirit. Although having never lived anywhere outside of the city of my birth, Im not really qualified to preach on this subject, but because of my spectacular wisdom and of course, extremely good nature, Im telling you about three mistakes, in my view, that you should never make when trying to adjust into a new city.Mistake 1  Trying too hard to belongFor all the When in Rome, do as the Romans do gyaan weve grown up on, its a mistake to shed your individuality in a bid to be like the people of the city youve moved to. Be the real you, if you want to stay away from depression. I remember, back in college, there was a girl who belonged to Madurai. Every day in the college canteen, I would notice her being visibly uncomfortable and sad. One day I told her how I find certain rice dishes tastier when eaten straight from the hand rather than the spoon. She suddenly warmed up and said that shes used to eating with hand, and was worried that shell be judged for it. Lo batao. To hell with others, yaar, be what you are. That meal of sambhar-rice with our hands was the best meal I had in college because it came with such a rare smile from that girl. Lets please not forego the joy of living in this bid to adjust. Dont fake an accent, dont fake style, dont fake cool-ness, dont fake a smile. It shows.READ | A Calmer You, by Sonal Kalra: Dont turn vacation into vocation!Mistake 2  Harping about your ownRemember, a city and its people cannot warm up to you till you dont stop harping endlessly about how much you miss your native place, and how much better it is. Every place has its own highs and lows. There may be too much crime in Delhi as compared to your town, but there may also be rare opportunities here to explore and discover culture like no other place. Try to leverage on the uniqueness of whichever place you are in.Also, its much easier to make new friends when you are not always talking to  or about your old friends back home. As we grow in life, we have to make new friendships. Dont keep holding too tightly to the older ones so much that your hands are never free to shake them with new friends.Mistake 3  Forgetting to thank your luckHear it from someone like me who was born, brought up, studied and worked in the same 30km radius all her life. Would most likely retire, die and be cremated within the same area. Sometimes it boggles up my mind. Just sit back and imagine the world as a globe before you. We get to live only one life. A lot of us spend the whole of it in the fraction of a dot that you cant even spot on the globe with a microscope. Just be thankful if your dot is slightly bigger. It may be hellishly tough to adjust but every new place where you live, gives you two gifts  experience and memories. Cherish them.Sonal Kalra just got a job offer from Honolulu. She would have accepted it, but she loves her 30km radius too much. Also just saying Honolulu makes her giggle. Happy nature, you see.

Clutching hiking poles, the hikers picked their way through the slippery, boulder-strewn path to the salt pan. I told my friends about Al Wahbah, said Jeddah-based corporate banker Mohamed Bahroon. They had no clue.The little-known crater, barely a four-hour drive from the western city of Jeddah, is a remnant of volcanic activity  local folklore, however, has it as having been formed when two mountains were so passionately in love that one uprooted itself to unite with the other, leaving a bowl-shaped depression in its place.Roads and markersIn recent months, authorities have built roads and markers to the site and erected picnic shelters around the rim of the crater. The key challenge is to make such tourism sites accessible, said Mr. Khalifa, adding that he only had one camping group at the site that weekend. Tourism is one of the centrepieces of Vision 2030, the blueprint to prepare the biggest Arab economy for the post-oil era, which was conceived by powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.In August the kingdom announced a multi-million dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts. It also plans to develop historic sites such as the centuries-old Madain Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra. The kingdom aims to nearly double the annual number of tourists it attracts to 30 million by 2030, with the sector projected to become one of its top revenue earners.Tourism chief Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz said that preparations were afoot to launch electronic visas in the first quarter of 2018 to all nationals whose countries allow their citizens to visit the Gulf state. The kingdom is a very big treasure, Prince Sultan said, describing its stunning landscapes. Were not just oil traders.In an effort to change perceptions, Saudi Arabia has relaxed some of its most rigid rules  lifting a cinema ban, allowing gender-mixed sporting events and announcing that women will be allowed to drive from next June.But its absolute ban on alcohol still makes it a hard sell for many global tourists, experts say.Rumours have swirled about plans to create exclusive resorts for foreign tourists, which, similar to many expat compounds in Riyadh, would have more relaxed norms.No alcoholBut Prince Sultan said the kingdom , home to Islams holiest sites, would not permit alcohol as we do not want to give up our culture and our local values.Given the sensitivities of opening up to large numbers of non-Muslim tourists, Id expect the authorities to focus more on encouraging local and regional visitors in the first instance, while the tourist infrastructure is developed, said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in the United States. And then cautiously start to market the kingdom to the wider world.But global travel agencies such as Britain-based Steppes Travel are already planning to offer packaged tours. There is a lot of potential for Saudi tourism  we know this not least from the pent-up demand we have within our own database, said Justin Wateridge, managing director of Steppes Travel.There is interest in those that know and understand Saudi Arabia and not much needs to change other than the issuing of tourist visas. Travel breaks down barriers and prejudice.There is a lot of potential . We know this not least from the pent-up demand we have within our own database.Justin WateridgeMD, Steppes Travel"

Nengroo Muhammad Shahids family was the first in Sir Hama village in south Kashmir to convert paddy fields into high-yielding apple orchards. (Below) Khiram-Sirhama, which was declared as the Valleys first Apple Model Village seven weeks ago.NISSAR AHMADAs the mellow winter sun prepares to set, the lengthening shadows turn hazy from the smoke in Nazeer Ahmad Dars paddy fields, some 59 km away from Srinagar.The 52-year-old resident of Anantnags Sir Hama village in south Kashmir will soon burn the last of his paddy shoot stocks, spread over the 20 kanals (1.1 hectares) of his farm. Having spent six decades cultivating paddy, the Dars, a family of six, have taken the tough decision to switch crops and await the change in their fortunes.My neighbours son uprooted expensive and well-nursed traditional apple trees and replaced them with high-density, high-yielding, foreign variety apple trees. I can see how things have improved for them in the last four years. I want to replicate their success story, Dar says.The decision wasnt an easy one to make. For one, the Dars will not grow anything for the next two years, in order to let their paddy field become bone dry, and to reduce the methane content left behind by six decades of paddy cultivation. They are staring at a loss of Rs. 1 lakh per hectare. But the family is ready to trade the temporary loss for larger gains in the near future.Taking risks is part of life. I am not very rich. My only source of income is this land. I have saved some money. Now I have put my faith in Allah and in high-yielding apple trees that I will plant two years from now, Dar says.Tripling profitsThe neighbour who has inspired many farmers like Dar to convert their loss-making paddy fields into profitable apple orchards is 24-year-old Nengroo Muhammad Shahid, a postgraduate in History. His family was the first in this village of 6,000 people to convert paddy fields into high-yielding apple orchards.People were shocked to see me uprooting 35- to 40-year-old traditional apple trees. I replaced them with M-9, a dwarf apple rootstock. The M-106, a semi-dwarf planted by my grandfather on just six kanals (0.3 hectares) had doubled our profits. M-9 will triple it, says Shahid, who owns a car and a three-storey house.With his new, high-yielding variety, Shahid plucks 1,000 boxes of apples per hectare (20 kg a box), up from the 300-400 boxes that he used to get from the traditional varieties. The yield on my farm has gone up from 10-12 to 20 metric tonnes, he says, adding that unlike many others, he will never apply for a government job in Kashmir. The money the apple business is going to generate in the future will change this place forever.Shahid hopes that 33% of his village will switch from paddy to M-9, a variety of apple imported from Europe by the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) government two years ago. The States Chief Horticulture Officer, Manzoor Ahmad Bhat, says that the first rootstock of high-yielding trees (M-106) was introduced in 2004, and an ultra-density, high-yielding variety was imported in 2016. According to official figures, so far 72 hectares of orchard land have been planted with dwarf varieties of the M-9 rootstock.Shahid is hopeful of a bumper crop this year, and is planning a complete organic orchard with a dairy, sheep farm, and fish ponds. In an orchard like this, a vermicomposter will function in an organic manner, with multiple facilities, he says.Denting paddy yieldSir Hama used to be cut off from the rest of the State due to poor road connectivity. But today it reflects the changes taking place across the Valley. With an eye on the potential for orchard tourism, the State government is connecting the village to the Srinagar-Jammu highway through two different routes.The landscape of agricultural fields is swiftly changing, from swirling paddy fields to stout treelines. Of Sir Hamas 786.7 hectares of land, 458.2 hectares are already under orchards, which account for 15120.6 million apple trees. The land conversion from paddy to apple has already dented the paddy yield, with growth in rice production tapering off in recent years. The production graph shows only a marginal increase of 0.61 metric tonnes, from 5 lakh in 2008 to 5.61 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) in 2012.But given the changing dietary habits in Kashmir, the fall in rice yield is unlikely to affect the local market. Earlier, people in Kashmir would consume good quantities of rice three times a day, both in urban and rural pockets. But the introduction of flour, smaller rice portions, and the shift away from rice due to medical reasons has given a cushion to the rice market in Kashmir. In rural areas, farmers still grow enough rice to meet their annual demand, Bhat says.In Khiram-Sirhama, which was declared the Valleys first Apple Model Village seven weeks ago, the farmers have gone through some rough times. The area went through its worst drought in the 1990s and last year, it also saw repeated hailstorms which damaged the traditional apple trees, says Lubna Aijaz Beg, Horticulture Officer of the Khiram-Sir Hama belt. But now, at least 100 kanals (5.05 hectares) of paddy field in Sir Hama turn into orchards annually. The place is perfect for apple farming.With the introduction of M-9, hailstorms will no more be able to damage the trees. Given their size and the support system these dwarf trees require, the farmers can easily use hail nets to shield their orchards, Beg says.J&Ks Minister for Revenue, Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, Abdul Rehman Veeri, who set up the model village, said the project was aimed at rejuvenation of old orchards with new varieties.The government will provide farm machines such as tractors, sprayers, juice preservation plants, and also train the farmers in grading and packing. This is going to change the economic profile of Kashmir, Veeri says.The Ministers confidence stems from the unique features of M-9 rootstock varieties such as Super Chief, Red Chief, Red Velox, Gala Redlum, and Golden Reindeer, among others. Unlike the traditional ones such as Delicious and Ambri, whose harvest season are restricted to October and November, M-9 rootstock trees will stretch the harvest season by four months. They will start bearing fruit as early as June and stay till November. It allows farmers to steadily sell the produce in the market at higher rates, which was not possible with bulk harvests where you only had two months to sell all the produce, Beg says.Beg, who joined the horticulture department six years ago, has seen the socioeconomic changes brought about by the introduction of M-106 and M-9 rootstocks. She talks about how farmers now have water pools in many newly constructed mansions in far-off villages such as Khiram. Pools are yet to become a fad in the urban centres of Kashmir. But with the fillip to the farm economy provided by the apple push, the Valley is set to see a new dawn, Beg says.More trees per hectareWhat is sustaining this new-found buoyancy? Traditional apple trees spread over one hectare of land fetch just 10 to 12 metric tonnes of apple annually. But the high-density ones will fetch 25 metric tonnes, Beg says. This is possible partly because unlike traditional apple trees, dwarf varieties are planted in a double row, with a gap of just two or three feet between the rows. Traditional apple trees require a gap of 10 to 12 feet between rows for healthy growth.With more number of trees per hectare, experts expect yields of 80-120 metric tonnes from a hectare in the near future. Moreover, unlike traditional apple trees, where the colour and sweetness of the fruit vary depending on exposure to sunlight and chemical treatment, the M-9 and M-106 varieties will be uniform in colour and in taste, with the same quality maintained in at least 97% of the apples.The dwarf varieties take two years to bear fruit. They are also less labour-intensive compared to the traditional trees, whose higher foliage cover meant more expenditure on pruning, not to mention more manpower to sprinkle pesticides. The dwarf trees are also easier to maintain given their spread and height, Beg says. The State horticulture department is looking at planting 4,000 high-density apple trees per hectare, against the traditional spread of less than 2,200 trees per hectare.Jobs from appleOne major benefit from the paddy field conversion and the introduction of high-yielding trees is the creation of new job opportunities. According to State government officials, in 2016-17, Kashmirs horticulture sector generated 7.71 crore man-days, chiefly in apple fields. Buoyed by this, 2018-19 and 2019-20 are being officially celebrated as apple years by the government.J&K Horticulture Minister Syed Basharat Bukhari foresees the sector becoming a major employment generator. One hectare of an apple orchard generates almost 400 man-days. Fresh fruit production is 20.75 LMTs and dry fruit production is 2.80 LMTs in the Valley, accounting for about 8% of the States Gross Domestic Product (GDP). About seven lakh farming families, or 33 lakh individuals, are directly or indirectly dependent on it, Bukhari says.With 75,000 hectares brought under high-density apple plantations since 2004, the Valley is headed for some major changes. For the first time in 36 years, a new census is under way to determine the health and fruit-bearing capacity of apple trees.We plan to import 9 lakh high-density plants in the next year to cover around 320 hectares of orchard. We will create our own nurseries by importing 3.47 lakh clone rootstocks of imported varieties, Bukhari says.Orchard owner Bashir Ahmad Yatoo, a resident of Hitigam village, describes the apple success story thus: What paddy fields of the entire village would make in profit is equal to the profit earned from just two orchards owned by villagers. Who will waste time on paddy now? We grow enough of it for our needs at home.The challengesThe apple success story would have taken off in a big way long ago had it not been for the grim political subplots. The introduction of high-density rootstock was delayed by over a decade after an Indo-Italian project to improve yields by sharing scientific know-how was shelved in 1989. The situation grew worse in the 1990s as militancy broke out and the Indo-Italian project failed to take off. It was the first big stumbling block for an otherwise perfect success story, says Bhat.Apple cultivation first came to Kashmir in the 1930s, when it covered just 12,000 hectares in north Kashmirs Sopore. Over eight decades, it emerged as a major contributor to Kashmirs GDP. Today, horticulture, dominated by apple production, is a Rs. 9,000 crore sector for the State, up from Rs. 6,000 crore in 2015.At the same time, experts also warn that the fast-spreading European varieties may end the apples local flavour and colour for all times to come. The famed Kashmiri varieties of Ambri and Delicious are vanishing from the market. The varsities need to step in to preserve these local varieties, Bhat says.According to official figures, of the 2.14 lakh hectares of horticulture land in Kashmir, 1.45 hectares is under apple cultivation. About 1.85 lakh hectares were added in just one year, taking the yield from 11 LMT in 2006 to 17.9 LMT in 2017. Now J&K is the largest apple-producing State in India, accounting for 71% of the national production, officials say. The time has come to compete with Chinese and European apples in the global market, adds Beg.Though production is on an unprecedented upward trend, the Chinese could upset the applecart. China is seeking a zero import duty policy. Its proposal falls under the ambit of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade pact. The RCEP free trade pact, if done, will eliminate the existing 70% import duty on apples, says Arjiman Hussian Talib, who runs the Valleys first agriculture magazine, Ziraat Times.The large-scale switch from paddy to apple not only involves a shift from water-intensive crop to dry land orchard farming, but is also likely to impact the water-management system in the state. South Kashmirs major districts  Anantnag (with 33,768 hectares under horticulture), Shopian (26,231 hectares), Kulgam (25,606 hectares) and Pulwama (25,133 hectares)  where the switch is most popular, are located along the Jhelum river and the major streams contributing to it.Climatologist and consultant on water issues Shakil Romshoo, who heads the Earth Sciences department, Kashmir University, adds a word of caution: The shift from the high water-intensity paddy crop to low water-intensity orchards is bound to impact the water management within Kashmir and, in the long run, impact the Indus Water Treaty of 1964 between India and Pakistan. It is also likely to lead to more flooding in Srinagar and more water discharge into Pakistan.The water retained in the paddy fields, Romshoo says, recharges the groundwater too. The shrinking paddy fields will result in less and less recharge, and thus lower groundwater levels in Kashmir in the future. Kashmir, which witnessed a major flood, the first in 100 years, in 2014, is staring at a grim scenario. Many of the paddy lands located in the Jhelum floodplains acted as a temporary reservoir during the flooding, and slowly released the floodwaters to the river system.But the hydrological (flooding) functionality of the paddy lands in the floodplains has been adversely affected due to the conversion of the land system in the Valley. It has made the area and the people living in the floodplains more vulnerable to floods, says Romshoo.Experts suggest water regulation. As per the the 1964 Indus Water Treaty, Kashmir is entitled to 1.25 Million Acre Feet (MAF) of water storage under the treaty. The water requirement for irrigation (accounting for the lions share of water consumption) in the Kashmir Valley has drastically come down since the 1980s due to the conversion of paddy lands to other uses. Therefore, the switch to horticulture is in a way benefiting Pakistan as the people of J&K are not able to utilise the full entitlement of water provided for under the treaty, Romshoo says. India has to expeditiously set up the required infrastructure for storing the entitled water under the treaty, which currently goes into Pakistan.He adds: Though they are provided for under the treaty, setting up storage facilities would certainly raise concerns across the border as Pakistan has objected to every water infrastructure development proposal on the Indus that has been put up by India in J&K.Floods do pose a threat to the current trend of mass conversion to apple cultivation. Bhat, however, believes that the dwarf rootstock will survive them. Dwarf varieties, unlike traditional ones, have short roots, helping them to avoid the high water table, which is detrimental for apple trees. In 2014, apple crops did survive the flood in many areas.As the January sun shines unusually late in the afternoon in Sir Hama, it poses another problem. All the apple varieties require a chilling period in winter to allow the trees to fight insects and pests. In case there is no snow this year, the trees are bound to face problems, as insecticides will then have to be used. The trees capacity to battle pests goes down without the chilling period provided by the snowfall. Even the dwarf varieties are not immune to the effects of climate change.What paddy fields of the entire village would make in profit is equal to the profit earned from just two orchards owned by villagers. Who will waste time on paddy now?Bashir Ahmad YatooOrchard owner and a resident of Hitigam villageChina is seeking a zero import duty policy.

I did bump into Chef Alex Moser at some food do, but we never got to speak with him. Then, when a persistent young publicist invited me to try out the chefs fare, I agreed.The chef is at a restaurant called Hong Kong at Hotel Andaz Delhi  a concept by Hyatt, as it says  in Aerocity. I met the chef, discussed food, had a great Chinese meal and came home happily sated.Glitzy placeHong Kong is truly a glitzy place. The restaurant is huge, with a ground floor that seems specially designed for the young, and a first-floor area which is more suited to families and those who like to eat their food in peace. There is a king-sized bar, around which the young sat, drinks in hand, and not the least bit troubled by the loud music that was being played. I sat on the ground level, but wished it was better lit. I like to see what I eat.But what I ate was excellent. The food is essentially Cantonese which is not very hot, like, say Sichuan food. The dishes are light and flavoured with fresh herbs. And chef Moser tells me that his focus is always on fresh ingredients. He makes the most of what is seasonal, substituting some Chinese vegetables with Indian cousins freshly plucked from organic farms.We started with a warm roasted duck salad, with pomelo, pine nuts and shallots, which was very nice, indeed. Then there was some crunchy pickled radish with chilli and soya, and a dumpling with chicken  that was all right.Melt in the mouthWhat I loved was the crispy pork belly with a kasundi mustard sauce. The thick cubes of pork were crisp on the top, and incredibly soft below. I actually didnt have to chew it at all  it just vanished once I popped a piece into my mouth. And, of course, it went deliciously well with the mustard-kasundi sauce, the latter giving a somewhat bitter-and-sour flavour to it.Another dish that I really enjoyed was the Hong Kong style duck, served with a homemade barbecue sauce and mini baos. I took a bao, filled it with some of the roasted duck pieces, added the sauce and some greens, folded it, and took a nice juicy bite. It was delicious  the greens were crunchy, the duck was tender, and the sauce, piquant.The main meal consisted of a delightful wok-fried rice dish, and some free-range chicken, cooked with black bean, bell pepper and scallions. The rice was a mix of textures and flavours, for it had been cooked with three kinds of rice  red rice, bamboo rice and jasmine rice. The rice had been flavoured with preserved olive leaves, which gave it a tart flavour. Together, they did a neat number.The dessert consisted of an almond tapioca pudding (okay), passion fruit jelly (good) and bitter chocolate tart (very good).The chef likes to give a tweak to traditional Cantonese cuisine keeping regional produce in mind. And he adds a spice like onion seeds to his stir fried vegetables, to give it a little twist that is familiar  yet inspiring. And a lot of the taste in the dishes is linked to the fact that he doesnt use powders in his kitchen.It was a great meal, and I was happy to be able to catch up with the chef. I hope Ill get to see more of him this year."

(CAMPCO) on the premises of its chocolate factory. He said the draft has aimed at boosting shipments of agricultural products by identifying niche products and new markets. It has focused on value addition and reduction of wastage through pre- and post-harvest interventions.According to the Minister, the proposed policy will help in promoting farm clusters like the ones for industry.Mr. Prabhu said that import of commodities has affected farmers, including rubber growers, and the government intends to bring out a policy to help the latter. We will see how to improve the condition of rubber growers through a policy, he said. He also said the government had begun working out a policy on spices.Lauding Campco for protecting the interests of farmers, the Minister said such cooperative institutions were needed in the country. He said the setting up of Campco-like bodies would help in doubling the income of farmers. Cooperative institutions should act as a medium to bring the benefits of global market and economy to farmers, he said.More cooperatives in the agro-processing sector are needed, he added.Jyotindra Bhai Mehta, president of Sahakara Bharati, said there was a need to set up a chamber of commerce for agriculture in the country. There is also a need to bring out a policy to provide price stability on farm produce, he said. T. Shakuntala Shetty, MLA for Puttur, launched a premium assorted gift box of Campco chocolate with four variants of pure chocolate  Dietier-Dark, which is a sugar free chocolate; Milk Marvel Milk Chocolate, a cocoa butter-based pure milk chocolate; Milk n Milk White Chocolate, also a cocoa butter-based chocolate with rice crispies; and Funtan Dark Chocolate, which has high cocoa butter.The gift pack has two bars each of Funtan Dark Chocolate and Milk Marvel Milk Chocolate and one bar each of Dietier-Dark and Milk n Milk White Chocolate. The pack is priced at Rs. 500. An individual bar costs Rs. 100.The foundation stone for building a new warehouse of the cooperative in Kavu was also laid on the occasion. A bust of Varanashi Subraya Bhat, the founder of Campco, was unveiled."

After offering worship at the 18th century Kannathal Temple, famously known as Kannudaya Nayagi Amman Temple, they celebrated the festival by cooking Pongal, a rice delicacy, in front of the temple and offered the same to the Goddess.As they met once in a year, they used the occasion to interact with their relatives and even finalise marriage proposals, though the festival was initially organised to invoke blessings of the Goddess for the prosperity of the village.Every year, Nagarathars from the 20 vagayaras assemble in the village and visit their ancestral houses. The honour of providing the first slot for cooking Pongal in the specially marked arena near the Temple was given to a Nagarathar family by a draw of lots.As per tradition, the family which got the first slot, after a special puja at the temple, cooked Pongal in a mud pot followed by others. Nagarathars, dressed in the best, cooked pongal in three rows near the temple as tourists from foreign countries watched in awe.The temple authorities formed a committee to organise the festival. After drawing of lots for allotting slots for the families, the committee members distributed tokens in advance to avoid confusion. This year, 914 families took part in the festival, three more than last year. The festival began at 5.30 p.m. and went on till late in the evening amid performances by folk artistes. People other than Nagarathars who were residing in the village and nearby villages also took part in the festival."

The accused were nabbed with help of human and technical surveillance, the officer added.They allegedly told the police that they followed Kamil from Alipur on January 5 with the intention to rob the truck but killed him due to the fear of getting caught. The accused later revealed the location of Kamils remains in fields near Alipur.DNA testHis remains were eaten by stray animals but his clothes were found intact. We will do a DNA test to confirm his identity, the officer said.The need for a DNA test arose after the victims family said the remains did not belong to him and demanded a high-level probe.

People donate foodgrain and vegetables for the Paryaya festival. This is called Horekanike.Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Palimar Mutt will be ascending the Paryaya Peetha also known as Sarvajna Peetha at the 800-year-old Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple here on January 18 for the second time. It has been a tradition with the farmers of Mattu and surrounding hamlets to donate the vegetable for the Paryaya festival for the last nearly 500 years.Legend has it that Sri Vadiraja (1480-1600) of Sode Mutt, one of the Ashta Mutts of Udupi, gave the seeds of this special brinjal to farmers of Mattu village, about 20 km from Udupi, to cultivate.The farmers have been cultivating the Mattu Gulla since then.The taste of Mattu Gulla is different from other gullas  such as uru gulla  grown in the district. The farmers brought the Mattu Gulla in 19 vehicles including vans and tempos from their villages to Jodu Katte here.This was then carried in a procession from Jodu Katte to the Ugrana at the Rajangana Parking Space.Matti Laxminarayana Rao, General Secretary, Paryaya Reception Committee, told The Hindu that nearly four tonnes of Mattu Gulla had been received. The vegetable will be used for cooking meals for the Paryaya festival, he said.Laxman Mattu, farmer, said that it had been a tradition for the farmers of Mattu to donate Mattu Gulla for the Paryaya festival. Even otherwise, the farmers donate their first crop of Mattu Gulla to the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple as it was Sri Vadiraja, who had given seeds of Mattu Gulla to the farmers 500 years ago. This tradition has been there for the last 500 years, he said.Besides this, nearly 5,000 kg of rice had been donated by the Sri Vishnumurthy Temple from Mattu for the Paryaya festival along with the Mattu Gulla."

The Pejawar seer broke this record two years ago on January 18, 2016.Paryaya denotes the transfer of power of the exclusive rights of worshipping Lord Krishna and management of the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple from one seer to another seer of the Astha Mutts once in two years in turns.The city was teeming with devotees who had come not just from different parts of the State but also the country. The Car Street saw a maximum number of devotees going around visiting not just the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple, which was the cynosure of all the eyes but also the Ashta Mutts or eight mutts of Udupi.The queue to offer prayers to Lord Krishna at the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple was so long that it stretched nearly to the Rajangana parking space. Since Udupi is known as Anna Brahma Kshetra, there was a massive rush for the afternoon meals as well at the dinning halls of the Sri Krishna Mutt.Even the store-hall, where rice and coconuts and vegetables such as pumpkins, Mangalore cucumber, Mattu Gulla, Elephant Yams, and others were stored, were a centre of attraction. This was because the vegetables were kept in a systematic way and in an eye catching manner. Meanwhile, the cooks had a busy time cooking food for nearly 50,000 devotees.Various cultural programmes and orchestras were held at Chittaranjan Circle, Kinnimulki and other intersections of the city. At night, both the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple and the Palimar Mutt, which were beautifully illuminated, were the centre of attraction. Almost all buildings on the main streets of the city were illuminated.The main roads, where the Paryaya procession passed through, were decorated with arches, buntings and banners hailing Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Palimar Mutt."

5b13d7419855b762ecebfe72,Following the grain trail,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/following-the-grain-trail/article22452911.ece,2018-01-17,"Indias public distribution system (PDS) is in danger of being derailed in several States across the country. Recent disruptions of the PDS have taken different forms, from compulsory biometric authentication to so-called direct benefit transfer (DBT). The consequences are alarming, but tend to go unreported.Biometric mix-upsJharkhand is a prime example of this problem. By mid-2016, the PDS in Jharkhand had greatly improved, partly due to a series of reforms inspired by Chhattisgarhs experience and intensified under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Instead of completing these reforms, for instance by removing private dealers, the Jharkhand government made Aadhaar-based biometric authentication compulsory for PDS users. The consequences, documented in a recent study published in theEconomic and Political Weekly, were sobering. Large numbers of people, especially among vulnerable groups such as widows and the elderly, found themselves excluded from the PDS. Those who were still able to buy their food rations faced considerable inconvenience due to connectivity and biometric failures. Worse, there was a revival of corruption, as PDS rice meant for those who failed the biometric test was siphoned off with abandon.The damage was made worse in mid-2017, when the Jharkhand government mass-cancelled ration cards not linked with Aadhaar. On September 22, the government claimed that Aadhaar had enabled it to cancel 11 lakh fake ration cards, but this figure stands no scrutiny, and indeed, it was retracted later. Many of the cancelled ration cards actually belonged to families that had been unable to link their card with Aadhaar for no fault of their own. The family of Santoshi Kumari, an 11-year old Dalit girl who died of hunger on September 28, was among them.The mass-cancellation of Aadhaar-less ration cards, without verification and without even informing the victims, was both inhuman and illegal. The State government received some flak for it from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)  it is another matter that UIDAI is participating in the crusade to make Aadhaar-based biometric authentication compulsory in various contexts. But far from learning from this mistake, or doing anything to repair it, the Jharkhand government launched a further attack on peoples food entitlements: the monthly PDS rations of 5 kg per person were restricted to those whose individual names had been linked with Aadhaar in the ration-cards database. The following sort of situation is now very common in rural Jharkhand: a family has five members, but only three are listed along with their Aadhaar number in the database, so the family ends up getting 15 kg of rice per month instead of 25 kg. This restriction, incidentally, is a flagrant violation of the instructions issued by the Food Ministry in Delhi on October 24, in response to the uproar that followed Santoshi Kumaris death.The cash routeAll this, however, is just a trailer. Preparations are on for a much bigger assault on the PDS in Jharkhand: the transition to so-called direct benefit transfer. Under the DBT system, people have to collect their food subsidy in cash from the bank before using it to buy rice from the ration shop at Rs. 32 per kg. Until now, they were able to buy rice from the ration shop at Rs. 1 per kg. Direct benefit transfer is an odd term for the new system, whereby the food subsidy is provided in a very roundabout way.The DBT system was initiated in Nagri Block of Ranchi district last October, on an experimental basis. The State government is planning to extend it in other parts if the experiment works. But it seems to have decided in advance that the experiment is a success, without paying serious attention to the ground realities.In Nagri, it does not take long to discover that the new system is a disaster, and that most people are angry with it. The main problem with DBT is that people waste enormous time shuttling between the banks,pragya kendras(common service centres) and ration shops to get hold of their money and then use it to buy rice at the ration shop. For many of them, this is a three-step process. First, they go to the bank to find out whether the subsidy has been credited and update their passbook. Second, they go to thepragya kendrato withdraw the cash, as the bank often insists on their doing so from these centres. Third, they take the cash to the ration shop to buy rice at Rs. 32 per kg. At every step, there are long queues, and for many people the bank orpragya kendrais also far away. For people with mobility problems, like the elderly or disabled, this entire process is a nightmare. One elderly woman we met had to be taken to the bank each time by two relatives  one to drive the motorbike and one to hold her from the back seat.The ordeal was particularly trying in the last few weeks, when people had to adapt to the new system. Many families have several bank accounts, but apparently, they were not told where to look for their subsidy. Even the bank manager we met in Nagri, or for that matter the Block Development Officer, did not know which account is selected for DBT when a household has several bank accounts. As a result, many people had to run from bank to bank to find out where their subsidy had been deposited. This is all the more difficult as the food subsidy is not always easy to distinguish from other bank credits.If people had cash reserves, the system might work better: PDS purchases would not be contingent on bank transactions. What is striking is that so many people in rural Jharkhand, even in a relatively developed block like Nagri, have so little cash. And even those who have some cash, it seems, prefer to use the DBT subsidy to buy rice from the ration shop, partly because they are not clear about the rules of the game.Incidentally, the State government announced last year that Nagri was all set to become Jharkhands first cashless block. Today, it is forcing people to handle more cash than they want to.Beyond JharkhandEven as the people of Nagri fume and protest against the DBT experiment, the State government is trying its best to project it as a success and justify its extension to the whole State. If this happens, millions of people will face renewed food insecurity.Jharkhand is among the worst cases of destabilisation of the PDS, but similar moves are happening in other States. Most of them are under tremendous pressure from the Central government to impose Aadhaar-based biometric authentication or move towards DBT. In Bihar, I am told, DBT failed in the pilot block (Kasba in Purnia district), but the failure went largely unreported. In Rajasthan, the biometric authentication has caused enormous damage, evident even in the governments own transactions data. Even Chhattisgarh, known for its model PDS, is under pressure to follow the diktats of the Central government and adopt Aadhaar-based technology. In all these States, we know senior officers in the Food Department who understand the inappropriateness of this technology and privately oppose it. Yet, they have no choice but to follow the Central governments instructions. This is symptomatic of a larger malady in Indias social sector: growing centralisation and technocracy.The most disturbing aspect of this trend is a lack of concern for the hardships that people face. Aadhaar-less ration cards are cancelled without notice. Pensions are discontinued without the victims being told what the problem is. Job cards are cancelled just to meet the 100% seeding targets. Elderly persons with rough fingerprints are deprived of food rations without compensation. Cash payments are automatically redirected to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts that people sometimes know nothing about. In effect, they are treated as guinea pigs for undependable technologies, without any effective arrangements for grievance redressal or even information sharing. Let people perish if need be, Aadhaar must prevail.Jean Dreze is visiting professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University"

With two of three citizens living in villages, their incomes and consumption patterns are critical to increase demand for industry. As per the advance estimates of growth in gross value added for 2017-18, farm output will expand 2.1% compared with 4.9% the previous year. Budget 2018-19 can be expected to have a strong focus on rural India.India is already the largest producer of milk and the second-largest of grains, fruits and vegetables and fish. However, productivity of crops is often below the global average and much of the farm produce is wasted in the absence of a robust cold chain and warehousing facilities. The government has introduced a seven-point strategy for doubling farmer incomes by 2023 and the upcoming budget is likely to action these. For industry, policy priorities relate to building rural infrastructure, addressing pricing of major agricultural crops, amending farm policies and inducing greater corporate participation and linkages with industry.Direct saleWhile minimum support prices are provided for 23 crops, the main procurement takes place for wheat, rice and cotton. Farmers, who suffer from myriad risks, must get remunerative prices which can be done through strengthening and expanding e-NAM (electronic markets) in all States. A single levy of APMC fees across the country can encourage investments. Farmers should be permitted to sell their produce directly to food processing firms, aggregators and retailers. A mechanism to involve the private sector in procurement, storage and distribution of food grains at MSP rates may be considered for the Public Distribution System,which can result in huge savings for the Centre. Under infrastructure, irrigation is a key gap, covering less than half of net sown area. The Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Program received a major thrust in the last Budget. This should be continued to ensure that AIBP projects are completed at the earliest. Further, drip irrigation and micro irrigation too need focus. A chain of post-harvest infrastructure of cold storage and warehouses can effectively link agri-produce with markets and with food processing facilities. Currently, less than 10% of produce is processed. The government has initiated mega food parks and provided incentives for creating post-harvest facilities. It may consider setting up cold chains in all districts and leasing them out to food processing and logistics firms. One way to encourage greater connect with industry is to boost contract farming and long-term land leasing, as has been done by certain States, without giving tenancy or ownership rights. This would aggregate small land holdings and add to productivity resulting in higher income for the farmers.Another way is to create more farmer producer organisations that will augment collective bargaining and help link with processing clusters for direct offtake of produce. The Budget could incentivise this with easier credit availability or subsidised inputs for FPOs.A chain of post-harvest infrastructure of cold storage and warehouses can link agri-produce with markets and with food processing facilities"

Along with the rice, value added products from pokkali rice were sold briskly on Monday.People waited patiently for fresh supplies of live fishes to arrive at the venue of the exhibition. Live tilapia and sea bass (kaalanchi) were brought from the farms from cages in the Kochi backwaters near Kadamakkudy by farmers such as T.V. Sreekumar, who said that the demand was overwhelming. The exhibition also featured the first sales of pokkali rice and rice products under the Jaiva Pokkali brand, which has been brought out by a farmer producer company supported by the Ernakulam District Krishi Vigyan Kendra and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development."

Mr. Kumar, who took charge four months ago, also talks about the current loopholes in job creation. Edited excerpts:What is your reaction to comments that doubling of farmers incomes by 2022 is all talk?One should not underestimate the importance of talking. At least we are talking now. And the farmers welfare is the focus of attention. When did that last happen? Now, we have set up a task force which is committed to setting up 10 pilot projects in different agro-climatic regions to prove that this can be done.We should look at finding innovative ways to get over the problem of land fragmentation and bring farmers together... give them the option of producing high value crops. We need to make them a participant in higher value addition by completing the value chain which will extend beyond the farm, to the market and then maybe to the agro-processing units. We also need to shift them from traditional crops to crops which are of higher value and in sync with the emerging demand patterns of our country. The demand for wheat, rice and maize is going down as incomes rise.What is happening on the new data on employment?There was a task force chaired by my predecessor, and its recommendations had been accepted by the PM and now they are being implemented by the Ministry of Labour and MoSPI. By September, we are hopeful that we will get very good household data on employment. And you will get this now every year. The second part is that we may also look at employer-based data generation, like what the U.S. does.Will this cover the informal sector?Probably not... Not at this stage. This itself will be a very big start, once we get started we will see. There is a huge blurring of distinction between organised and unorganised.For example, where would you put an Ola or an Uber driver? He is not registered anywhere, but gets his income through a bank credit. They also get loans on the basis of income track. Theres an outdated discussion that is going on which does not look at new economy jobs. With the large volumes of contract fixed term labour, is it even relevant to talk about organised and unorganised? That is a question that I am asking. What may be useful is talking about areas where working conditions may not be as you would expect.Amid all the discussion over lack of employment, what are the current loopholes in employment generation?One is of course growth. The other, in my view, is this continued emphasis on giving people capital subsidy, rather than labour subsidy. Being a highly-priced and highly-valuable democracy, giving the right to the workers that they have, we may have converted into a high labour economy from a surplus labour economy.Given that our labour costs have increased, which is not in line in with our labour availability, I think its high time we thought of giving labour subsidies in some form or the other.All our major competitors and in developed economies, the amount of worker consumption basket that they provide as public goods is much much higher than us. For example, in Germany, Vietnam and China, every workers healthcare is taken care of. Our healthcare, 82% is out of pocket expenses. So, the worker must be given more income as he/she does not have access to public health or housing.In Germany, I think 85% of the workers are housed in public housing. My thought is that as long as you are not able to increase the share of public goods and services in the workers consumption basket, you need to compensate them for the higher cost of living. And that I think is the basic problem today in employment. And the government must rethink this.The other, of course, is the much focussed attention on your labour intensive, employment intensive industries, including services. That is rather simple, can be done. It just requires good governance. This government is about that.But wont labour subsidy put additional pressure?Of course it will. But that will require you to improve the government's efficiency of expenditure.It is not as if the government does not spend money on all this, it does.Through DBT and increase in efficiency, this can be done. It does not necessarily need to translate into higher revenue deficit.And hopefully in any case, if you have this in your focus, then as revenue increases with GST, transfer it there rather than on some other things rather than giving capital subsidies which you give every time so far.One should not underestimate the importance of talking. At least we are talking now."

BalachandarL_BalachandarFarmers celebrated Pongal, the harvest festival, with a somehow dampened spirit on Sunday, as the northeast monsoon failed for the second successive year, resulting in withering of paddy crop on 1.26 lakh hectares in the district.More than one lakh farmers had raised paddy crop in the rain-fed areas and the loss was almost total. The farmers, however, continued with the tradition of celebrating the festival.They wore new clothes, decorated their front yards with colourful kolams and gave a fresh coat of paints to their houses. On the occasion of Mattu Pongal on Monday, they gave bath to their cattle, painted their horns and adorned them with garlands of sugarcane and rice delicacies.The farmers would usually prepare pongal with freshly harvested rice grains, but this year they bought rice from shops and celebrated the festival.The cheer was missing and the celebration was a mere ritual, said advocate M. Somasundaram, who led the Pongal festivities, held at Nambayee Valasai by Rotary Club of Uchipulli on Sunday. The club conducted sports events and competitions, and distributed prizes to winners, he said.The pomp was missing in Thiruvadanai block, considered the rice bowl of the district, as paddy cultivated on about 45,000 hectares had withered. In some villages, farmers cooked Pongal in front of local temples and let loose their cattle.Silver jubilee Pongal festival was organised at Aruoli Vinayakar Temple in Vazhuthur. Sports events and competitions were organised for children and the youth on the occasion. Annadhanam was served to the people."

But, the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) in the State was not equipped currently to carry out weight-for-height measurements of under-5 children.We have taken up the matter of addressing SAM with the State government. Since measuring height for small children is tricky, this could be done using a mid-upper-arm-circumference tape.If the measurement is below 11.5 cm, it confirms that the child is severely malnourished. Anganwadi workers alone identify underweight children, so nobody else knows the number. That is why measuring height is crucial as SAM children have a higher probability of dying, over 10 times, compared to normal children, Mr. Zachariah said.Anaemic womenR. Kannan, director of the ICDS in the State, said prevalence of severe malnutrition among children was the result of a vicious cycle starting from unhealthy mothers.In Tamil Nadu, half of the women in child-bearing age are found to be anaemic, NFHS-4 data shows. Our target is to reduce malnutrition in women by 2% every year, Mr. Kannan said.Lack of sanitation could also play a role in influencing anaemia in women, he added.Mr. Zachariah said that States which had identified high levels of malnutrition had set up at least one nutrition rehabilitation centre per district to address the issue, for example, Madhya Pradesh. However, as Tamil Nadu was yet to identify the State-level occurrence of SAM through separate measures, it had only two nutrition rehabilitation centres overall in the State.Only if Tamil Nadu undertakes a State-level survey and intervention, high levels of SAM can be reduced in the State, experts say. Despite a well-functioning ICDS system and universal PDS, the malnutrition numbers are a cause of worry.Multi-sectoral approachAt a meeting organised by the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation on Tuesday, experts emphasised the need to follow an integrated approach to addressing the problem of malnutrition in the State. Since different departments, from health to nutrition to sanitation departments influenced outcomes, experts said that only a multi-sectoral approach could address the issue.Professor M.S. Swaminathan also emphasised the need for nutrition security. The first 1,000 days of a childs nutrition is very important. Similarly, for adults it is not only rice or wheat but a diversified diet that would address nutrition concerns. The Food Security Act talks about 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month. But that is not going to be enough. We need to move from food security to nutrition security, he said."

RamakrishnaA 20-minute drive south of Charminar is all it takes to wonder whether one has teleported oneself to a west Asian country. For, once in Barkas and Yerrakunta suburbs, one is greeted by exotic signage in Arabic on restaurants like Mataam al Arabi, Al Saud Bait al Mandi and Al Khaleej serving the Arabian delicacy Mandi . And the business is booming.The connection is clear. The two neighbourhoods are home to those who arrived here from Hadhramaut in Yemen over two centuries ago. Several of these restaurateurs continue to bear Arabian tribal affiliations. While one eatery is owned by those from the Bin Ziyad tribe, another belongs to the Nahdis. There are dozens of tribes as are the restaurants run by them.Abdul Raheem Yamani, proprietor of Real Arabian Dhaba, pegs the number of Mandi restaurants along the six-km stretch that connects Barkas to Shaheen Nagar along the Srisailam highway at approximately 35. This is the reason why the highway has a new moniker  Mandi Road, he says.The restaurateurs say that the spurt in the number of Mandi restaurants began in 2011 when the Arab community realised that it was a profitable business. Restaurants started mushrooming not just along the margins of the main thoroughfares, but in the by-lanes of Barkas.With diners converging from across the city, observers say that while traditional Hyderabadi biryani continues to be famous, Mandi is giving it a run for money.One of the first Mandi restaurants in the area is Mataam al Arabi. Its proprietor Abdullah Bashaadi says the dish is a combination of large chunks of mutton and rice garnished with dry fruits.The 38 year old recounts that he began the business in 2010 soon after returning from the Haj. We were served Mandi during the pilgrimage. All ate from the same large thaala sitting on the floor . That is when I struck upon the idea to start a Mandi restaurant, Mr. Bashaadi says.The traditional Arabian method of diningsitting on the floor and eating from the same large dishhas been retained in all the Mandi restaurants.Like most who trace their ancestry to the Arabian Peninsula, Mr. Bashaadis great grandfather Ahmad bin Awad Bashaadi arrived in the city from Hadhramut, Yemen. In fact, noted scholar Omar Khalidi writes in Muslims in the Deccan: A Historical Survey that Hadramis were a part of Afwaj-e-Beqaidah (Irregular Army) of Asaf Jahs. Their numbers swelled so much so that the Diwan, Salar Jung, constituted a separate court, the Qazaat-e-Uroob , for them. Further, two Hadramis served as Commissioners of Police of Hyderabad State.Taha Quadri, a professional caterer specialising in Arabian cuisine, explains the Mandi variants. The rule of thumb is three parts of mutton to one part of rice. The rice is cooked in the same water that is used to boil the meat. Mutton can be replaced with fish, chicken and even quail, he says.But while diners converge at the Old City from all across Hyderabad, the dish is a hit with the IT crowd of Hitec City. The uptown area of Jubilee Hills has one.There was a great demand for the dish in this part of the city which is why we started the restaurant around nine months ago. A majority of our customers are those working in Hitec City, says Syed Waaris Ali, proprietor of Mandi @ 36."

When in Rome, please do as the Romans do. To these two travel advisories, let me add my own two bits. When in Nepal, dont forget to have some Thakali food.I first had Thakali food several years ago at a beautiful little spot near Pokhra in Nepal. Some days ago, in Kathmandu, I had another great Thakali thaali. I am still drooling at the memory of the big platter that was placed before me, each docket a colourful little splash. There was the beautiful green of some sauted leaves, the dark brown of a light dal, gold of fried potatoes, the white of the rice at the centre, and sundry other drool-worthy colours.We  a large and unruly group of friends, in the age group of 4-65  landed up at Jimbu Thakali by Capital Grill in Pokhari Marg in the heart of Kathmandu one sunny afternoon. The pleasant young couple who run the place told us about the components of the thaali, and took our orders  some wanted vegetarian, some with chicken, and quite a few with lamb.I had the lamb thaali, and it was simply out of this world. The meat curry  lightly cooked, but delicious  came in a separate bowl, while the thaali had the rice at the centre, surrounded by dal, lai saag, bitter gourd, potatoes, radish chutney,papad and sweet curd.Thakali food is the food of the Thakali people, many of whom were traditionally in trade. So the cuisine is varied, though its essence lies in dal-bhaat-tarkari.Indigenous foodYou do get to eat a lot of buckwheat rotis in Thakali homes, as well as buffalo meat.The lamb curry was simply delicious. It wasnt thick with spices, but redolent with light and just the right flavours. I poured a generous dollop of ghee into my rice and had that with the greens  which together made a great meal in itself. The potatoes were tangy and the karelas were crunchy. The radish chutney complemented the light dal, and I ended the meal with a crisp papad, and then with the bowl of sweet dahi (good, but, alas, not like the delightful dahi that we had eaten in Bhaktapur on an earlier trip).The owner said he had picked up the nuances of Thakali food from his mother, known far and wide for the way she wielded a ladle. Some of the flavours in the dishes came from the local herb, jimbu, a variation of which you will also find in Uttarakhand food.I think what makes the food so special is the light touch with which its cooked. The saag, for instance, was just sauted, which brought out the sharp flavours of the green, as well protected its striking colour. And what helped  for some among us are growing people (growing from the middle, that is) and enjoy quantity as much as quality  was that the thaali came with unlimited servings (barring for the meat, of course).These days, Nepali food is also available in Delhi. You can get Thakali food in a place called Ama Thakali in Majnu ka Tilla, and in Yeti in south Delhi.The highlight of my Nepal visit was the food. And among all the kinds of cuisine that we ate, the Thakali thaali was memorable. I think I now need to pay a visit to Ama Thakali. More of that later."

That is the motivation for students of a government degree college here, to take over barren fields at Konaje village and turn them into paddy fields.Now, their Rs. 80,000 investment in the fields that lay ignored for up to 20 years has yielded one months supply of rice for the mid-day meal for poor students at college. Those meals will be served from February 14.The five different plots totalling four acres had been abandoned by farmers and two were fallow for 20 years while the other three plots were not being used for six years.The 250 students, most of whom are volunteers for the National Service Scheme (NSS) of P. Dayananda Pai and P. Satish Pai Government First Grade College, decided to launch paddy cultivation there.They started on August 15, 2017 and at the end of January first week, got eight quintals of rice.Naveen N.

Mr. Konaje and his colleague Jephry Rodrigues, Assistant Professor and NSS programme coordinator, provided Rs. 50,000, of which Rs. 10,000 was refunded by the NSS fund. The balance of Rs. 30,000 was borne by Hasiru Sene a wing of the Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha. The fodder that was available after the harvest was given to a cow shelter.Members of Madhyama Kendra, Ullal have also supported the activities, he said.Growth plansIts not going to be a one harvest revolution for the students. Mr. Konaje said that in the 2018 monsoon, the students would expand and grow paddy on about 10 acres. That would meet the rice requirement for the meals for poor students much longer. College principal Rajashekar Hebbar said the students planned to add horticulture too in the next spell.The students are being encouraged to grow vegetables in their homes as well, and 50 of them would get five brinjal saplings each."

In the Parliamentary elections in 2014, the Old Mysuru region, which had five seats, saw all of them going to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs, he said. The same results would be repeated in the forthcoming Assembly elections. The BJP will return to power in the State. The people still recalled the welfare schemes of the former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa such as Bhagyalakshmi Bonds, bicycles and Sandhya Suraksha, he said.Instead of taking stern action to maintain law and order, the Siddarmaiah government had withdrawn 175 cases against Popular Front of India (PFI) and Karnataka Forum for Dignity. This had led to the release of their activists, who were disturbing peace and order in the society.The Ram Temple would be constructed at the Ramjanmabhumi at Ayodhya and the Centre was likely to take steps to implement the Uniform Civil Code, Mr. Simha added."

However, this season sowing is still going on in some areas.Delayed sowing means increased threat of salinity. It will also affect the next crop cycle and some farmers decided to abandon cultivation. In areas where wild rice attack was reported, farmers decided against farming as a weed management practice, said an official.However, J. Premkumar, principal agriculture officer, told The Hindu that there was not going to be much difference when combined acreage of second and puncha seasons are combined.It is a fact that some farmers have abandoned cultivation in the current season. But, when we look at an annual basis there is not going to be much difference. Farmers had grown paddy in an additional 3,100 hectares during the second season. We are also expecting sowing in another 2,500 hectares in the next couple of weeks. An exact picture could only be available towards the end of this month, Mr. Premkumar said.Online registrationThe decline in acreage is also evident from the slow progress farmers register online for the puncha season.According to Supplyco officials, around 23,000 farmers have so far registered their names for the next harvesting season.Date extendedDuring 2016-17 season, 33,862 farmers had registered online for the puncha season. Supplyco has extended the date for online registration till January 25, officials said.Pest attacksMeanwhile, attack by pests such as rice thrips and stem borer on paddy crops had been reported from places such as Thakazhi, Champakulam, and Veeyapuram in Kuttanad during the early stages of crop season.However, officials said the pest attack has now been brought under control in most of the affected areas."

There is little consumption of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, egg, or milk, the study said. Other commodities like lentil, spices, and salt are available at the SupplyCo store, which is far away. And, people use the facility less frequently.It was also found that 86.3% of the population were anaemic. Among women, 95.9% had anaemia.. A major expense is for health care services, for which they shell out nearly Rs. 500 for a trip to the nearest Primary Health Centre (PHC). While, the government offers reimbursement to tribal population for treatment expenses, it is not properly executed. Bureaucratic hurdles apart, there are instances of people pocketing the money for alcohol abuse, said Dr. Rakesh P.S. of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, who was associated with the study. Water scarcity is severe. Most resources start drying up by February. While there is little awareness about communicable and non-communicable diseases, the womenfolk are aware of the need for breast feeding of infants for the first six months.Incidentally, the cultural practices during mensuration and post-natal periods make many women take to oral contraceptives frequently. It was found that while youngsters had evolved a new culture of taking oral pills to avoid being into what is known as Valayma Kudi, they did not want to go easy on traditions. It shows that an intervention could be possible by educated people in the hamlets, said Dr. Numpelil."

He said the comments were an insult to women in the State. The schemes implemented by the Tamil Nadu Government were conceived by the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The welfare scheme such as gold for mangalasutra had benefited the poor. But the irresponsible comments and criticism made by Ms. Bedi against the scheme only show that she acted as a stumbling block to welfare measures.Mr. Anbalagan said that Ms. Bedi had no locus standi to criticise the schemes operated in a bigger State. She is the Lt. Governor in a palm-sized Union Territory but crosses the limits to come out with remarks and criticism, he alleged.The Lt. Governor did not have any idea about the purpose of free rice scheme operated in Puducherry. He called upon Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy and Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy to ensure that the cash in lieu of rice scheme announced for Scheduled Caste families and the below poverty line families ensured justice for all. The amount of Rs. 750 for BPL families was insufficient and it should be raised to Rs. 1,000 per family, he added."

He added that the meals have been planned after careful assessment of nutritional requirement of children.The country has taken strides in achieving food security. The mid-day meal programme started in Karnataka has ensured food security for children. To further this agenda, it is imperative that we focus on nutrition security, particularly amongst children. Introducing millets in mid-day meals is a great beginning towards ascertaining this.

They visited Vishakhapatnam, Anakapalle and Vijayawada during their week-long sojourn.Drink water only from a sealed bottle. Dont board a flight without getting vaccination as India is full of contagious diseases.

I am here without any vaccination and Im alive, says a smiling Gasser, a dentist, who stayed as a guest with Rotarian S.M.

They were overawed by the involvement of women in the making of the sweeter.They distributed English dictionaries to the students of Kajipalem School and visited the Rotary eye hospital. However, the green paddy fields across the Godavari districts were something that have impressed the visitors enormously.It green all the way. The train journey to Eluru was a memorable one as we saw the pristine paddy fields spread across hundreds of acres on both sides providing the staple food, rice to the people, says Ms Mona, an architect.The five-hour long train journey from Vizag to Eluru also dismissed one more myth they carried with them when they visited India. We were told many nasty things about the railway journey.

But an equally fair contender for the title is curry. The Japanese Navy even has a Curry Friday tradition where all navy canteens offer curry and rice as a Friday staple.Curry in Japan bears only a superficial resemblance to its Indian ancestor. It is more glutinous and is usually mixed with wheat flour. Its also sweeter, and often includes ingredients like apple and honey.History of the dishIn Japan, the dish dates to the 1870s when naval officers of the British Royal Navy who had picked up the curry habit in India passed it on to Japanese colleagues. The earliest recipes for raisu kar (rice curry) in Japanese cookbooks were lifted from Mrs Beetons Book of Household Management , in which the ingredients included curry powder, flour and sour apples. Since the dish came from Britain as far as the Japanese were concerned, curry rice was classified as western food.There is, however, one restaurant in Tokyo that has historically prided itself in serving authentic India curry  no wheat, no apples, and no holds barred on the chilli: Nakamuraya. How this came to be involves a rip-roaring yarn featuring a revolutionary fugitive from India, a love affair, and one of Japans leading bakeries.The Indian, Rash Behari Bose, is even better known in Japan than his namesake and fellow nationalist, Subhas Chandra Bose. Born in 1886, Bose worked at the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, but he was aflame with anti-colonial ideas acquired during the agitation against the Partition of Bengal in 1905. In 1912, he became involved in an assassination attempt of the Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge. As the colonial authorities closed in on him, he fled to Japan in 1915. He made his way first to Kobe under the name of P.S. Thakore, pretending to be a relative of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore whom Bose had read was planning a trip to Japan.From Kobe he immediately set out for Tokyo. Eventually, he made the acquaintance of Japanese pan-Asianists who were sympathetic to the cause of Indian independence, notably, a right-wing politician, Mitsuru Toyama.Toyama introduced Bose to the Soma family, owners of a well-known bakery called Nakamuraya. Facing extradition to British India, Bose hid at the Soma bakery for months during which time the familys eldest daughter Toshiko acted as his interpreter. Eventually, on Toyamas request, the two got married in 1918, a move that allowed Bose to move around Tokyo without attracting as much suspicion, and paved the way for his acquiring Japanese citizenship in 1923. The couple had two children before Toshiko died from pneumonia in 1925.A lasting contributionIn subsequent years, Bose continued to lobby for support for the Indian national movement in Japan via writings and lectures. But his most lasting contribution in introducing India to Japan was in launching authentic Indian curry at a new Nakamuraya caf in 1927. According to Bose of Nakamuraya , by Professor Takeshi Nakajima, Bose wanted to prove that the curry the Japanese were used to was a colonial invention. Getting his recipe on the Nakamuraya menu was therefore part of his anti-colonial struggle, by trying to win back Indias food culture from British hands. The curry was a hit, even though it was priced eight times higher than the average raisu kar.Following a bout of ill health, Bose died in 1945 aged 58, but in Japan his legend lives on through the curry that Nakamuraya continues to serve. It remains their most popular item. Since 2001, the company also sells ready-to-eat packaged curries using the original Bose recipe to convenience stores. These accounted for almost half the sales value of the 2.6 billion yen that the Nakamuraya Processed Foods division made in 2016.On a recent Monday, the Nakamuraya caf in Tokyos Shinjuku neighbourhood was buzzing with lunchtime customers. Almost every table had a serving of Genuine Indian-style Curry. I sat down for a serving. The verdict? The curry passed the flavour test  full-bodied spice and pleasing consistency. However, it was served in a sauce boat, betraying the British-origins of curry in Japan. But the steady gaze of a dhoti-clad Bose along with a kimono-clad Toshiko from a photograph hung at the restaurant entrance suggested that quibbles are best ignored.Pallavi Aiyar has reported from China, Europe, Indonesia and Japan.

Plugging of various natural flood escape routes following wanton conversion of wetlands and other natural water bodies for construction activities in the name of development has contributed to this, says N.K. Sukumaran Nair, environmentalist who was honoured with the State governments maiden Paristhithi Mithram Award a few days ago.Talking to The Hindu , Mr. Nair said the wetlands in the flood plains as well as urban areas should be conserved and managed wisely as they act as a natural sponge, absorbing and storing excess rainfall.Similarly, construction of stormwater drains is as important as laying of roads and other infrastructure while expanding a city or town. Low-lying areas should be used as drainage basins and not for construction, he said.He said the government should give top priority to the formulation of a pragmatic action plan to rejuvenate the wetlands and the tributaries of the Pampa, which is considered to be the lifeline of the Central Travancore region and the rice bowl of Kuttanad.VaraalchalThe poor condition of Varaalchal, a vast wetland in the flood plain area of Pampa river in Koipram grama panchayat, nearAranmula, bears testimony to the criminal negligence of the authorities towards wetland conservation, Mr. Nair said.The district panchayat had rejuvenated the heavily weeded Varaalchal at a cost of Rs. 50 lakh a year ago.The 2.5-km-long, 150-metre wide wetland was known for its rich biodiversity, especially the inland fish species of Channa ( varaal).But the Varaalchaal has once again degraded into a vast pool of Cabomba, an invasive species, as the authorities concerned failed to ensure its proper maintenance even after its rejuvenation a year ago.District panchayat president Annapoornadevi had taken earnest efforts for the rejuvenation of Varaalchal. The rejuvenated Varaalchal had recharged the wells too in the vicinity a year ago.Mr. Nair said the lowering of the Pampa riverbed owing to indiscriminate river sand quarrying over the past few decades had leftthe Varaalchal more or less delinked from the Pampa, except during floods."

An eco-friendly public toilet in Bengaluru.G.R.N. SomashekarStudying the impact of sanitation on stunting is tricky, and the much-awaited results of two ambitious new trials published this year show why.The trials, which implemented water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions in Bangladeshi and Kenyan villages for two years, were an effort to prevent stunting (low height for age) seen in children under two years in developing countries. Specifically, the WASH interventions included replacing poor-quality toilets with improved ones, chlorinating drinking water, and promoting handwashing  all in an attempt to protect toddlers from the faecal pathogens that are believed to interfere with their growth. But when the trials ended, disappointingly, the researchers found these children were not taller than those who did not receive these interventions. The findings are a setback to the hypothesis that improving sanitation can thwart childhood stunting. But how big a setback they are is disputed.The problem of open defecationOne point of view is that even though Bangladesh and Kenya see childhood stunting, they are dramatically different from countries such as India on a critical count. India is the only country today in which over 50% of the rural population still defecates in the open. Bangladesh, while close to India in population density, brought down open defecation rates from 42% in 2003 to just 1% in 2016.This critical difference was apparent in the two trials as well. Only around 3-9% of the participants in the trial in Bangladesh, and less than 5% in the trial in Kenya, defecated in the open at the start of the experiment. Most people already had toilets, albeit poor-quality ones, which the trial improved. It is likely that the children sampled were exposed to lower levels of faecal pathogens in the first place, which is why the trials didnt impact stunting, says Dean Spears, an economist at the Research Institute of Compassionate Economics (RICE). He argues that the only thing the trials show is that upgrading from a basic toilet to an improved toilet, along with other WASH interventions, didnt make children taller. But it is not as informative for someone focussed on Indias policy challenges, because the policy challenge in India is open defection, he says.Others say the new trials raise doubts about the link between sanitation and stunting in India too. Wolf-Peter Schmidt, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, points out that even in countries like Bangladesh, poor-quality toilets can cause heavy faecal contamination. Stephen Luby, an epidemiologist at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and lead investigator in the Bangladesh study, says that the villages in his study saw high rates of both contamination and stunting. Yet the WASH improvements made no difference, which means that other factors could be driving stunting. This heightens concerns that similar mechanisms underlie the association between open defecation and stunting in India, he says.Stunting is a complex problem. Children in richer South Asian countries are shorter on average than those in poorer Sub-Saharan African countries, and no intervention so far has closed this gap. Even though prenatal health, breastfeeding and diet, among dozens of factors, have been implicated in stunting, trials to encourage breastfeeding or supplement the mothers and childs diets have come up short. Simultaneously, researchers have homed in on an alternative hypothesis: that poor sanitation plays a greater role in stunting, because faecal bacteria and parasites deprive the child of nutrition.Evidence for this hypothesis has piled up over the decades. Studies in Gambian children in the 1990s showed that intestinal inflammation, possibly caused by exposure to faecal germs, is correlated with stunting. Among animals, baby mice infected with Escherichia coli , a faecal bacterium, grew slower, and showed signs of such intestinal inflammation when dissected. In 2013, Mr. Spears analysed data from 65 countries and found that much of the height variation among those regions could be explained by differences in open defecation rates. The study also showed that open defecation had a stronger impact on height when population density was higher, as is the case of India and Bangladesh.The problem is that most of the data which show that children in households with poor toilets are more likely to be stunted comes from descriptive studies. Descriptive studies have a downside: they can show association but not causation. The concern with these studies is that they may be explained by some other difference between households with nice toilets and those without, says Mr. Luby. This is why randomised control trials (RCTs), like the ones in Bangladesh and Kenya, matter.But this is where researchers run into another stumbling block. It is extremely hard to conduct RCTs on sanitation. Since 2010, some six groups, including three in India, have experimented with sanitation approaches to tackle stunting. Nearly all failed because they were unable to convince enough people to use toilets in the first place. One RCT in Mali, in 2015, did increase toilet use by 30% and saw a small increase in child growth. But RCTs need to be replicated before their findings can be extrapolated to other countries, says Amy Pickering, one of the studys authors who is from Tufts University. Another predicament is that for WASH interventions to be truly effective, more than one generation of families may need to adopt them. Most trials do not last longer than two years, given how expensive and logistically challenging they are.Changing habitsIndias Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) is an example of how difficult it is to change peoples sanitation habits. Even though the SBA aims to eliminate open defecation by 2019, data from the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey show the campaign hasnt changed much since it began. Almost halfway through the SBA, open defecation remained quite common in rural India and its distribution across districts looked pretty similar to 2011, Mr. Spears says. In Where India Goes , Mr. Spears and RICE demographer Diane Coffey argue that programmes like the SBA that focus on constructing toilets cant do much in the face of deep-rooted cultural beliefs about open defecation because they presume that people do not build toilets for financial reasons. If behavioural change campaigns are not initiated to tackle the problem, Indians will continue to defecate in the open even if they get toilets for free.Against this background, the Bangladesh study is significant because it did succeed in changing participant behaviour. It provides critical information for countries that have already eliminated open defecation. They may now want to weigh the merits of sanitation against other interventions like nutrition. What the trials mean for India is a tougher question. For an RCT to test the link between open defecation and stunting, it must figure out first how to get Indians to stop open defecation. Several researchers have tried this, but have come up dry.priyanka.pulla@thehindu.co.in"

Farmers said that they could not cultivate paddy in their entire holdings fearing of water shortage. Hence, many farmers did not cultivate paddy and had chosen alternative crops that can withstand drought condition to a level.Farmers expect the yield to be normal and wanted the minimum support price to be increased so that they could avoid loss. They added that water shortage led to many farmers not raising the crop in tail-end areas. Though labourers are available, their demand for more wages continues to worry farmers.Wages have increased, but not the yields and the price. However, we have to manage, said Karupannan, a farmer in Parisal Thurai.

Rajendran, Associate Director of Research, Kerala Agricultural University (KAU), said Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers Right Act was one of the milestones in the context.Dr. Rajendran said innovations by farmers had to get proper scientific validation and support from the scientific community or else their findings would be underestimated.Balakrishnan Kammana, a farmer scientist in the district, explained the process throught which he developed two pepper varieties, Suvarna and Aswathy. Mr. Balakrishnan requested the support of the scientific community for the assessment of chemical components and other ingredients of the pepper varieties.Somalatha Moli, a researcher at the Cochin University of Science and Technology, explained efforts made by the varsity to popularise intellectual property rights.Innovations by traditional healers in the district were also discussed at the seminar.The seminar was organised as part of the Wayanad Seed Fest 2018, a three-day community seed festival being organised by the M.S.

The play being performed at a theatre in Kolkata.A play written by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, highlighting her governments development initiatives and taking a dig at opposition parties, is now a key part of the Trinamool Congresss campaign in villages in the run-up to the panchayat polls. Around a hundred folk theatre and street theatre groups are performing hundreds of shows in rural Bengal at public meetings and street corners as the polling day draws close.The entire initiative is being overseen by Bratya Basu, theatre personality and the state IT Minister, according to people involved in the project. Avi Chakraborty, who directed the play, titled Jayatu (victorious), said, Bratya Basu gave us the script a week ago. We did rehearsals and then a show, which was videographed. Around a hundred street theatre and folk theatre groups have been chosen (to perform it in different parts of the state). Wehave sent them the CD, which is a kind of guideline for enacting it.Chakraborty said theatre reaches out to people in a more stirring manner than political speeches. A live street theatre or a drama on stage is more appealing to the people, he maintained.Chakraborty, part of Ashoknagar Nattyamukh, a theatre group, said, The play has been kept at 15 minutes and is part of campaign for the panchayat polls. Basu could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Having eight rural characters, Jayatus central theme revolves around development initiatives undertaken by the Banerjee government since 2011. It has songs and poems, narrated by the characters, highlighting initiatives such as Kanyashree (Bengal governments programme for the girl child), Jubashree (programme for the youth), Rupashree (initiative for marriage of young women).Among other government initiatives, it also takes up distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg, free bicycles to schoolchildren, establishment of new colleges and universities in the state.The dialogue speaks about initiatives for minority development such as scholarships for students, stipends for imams, among others.The play takes a dig at the Opposition, mainly Lal Party  or the CPI(M)  and calls the BJP (the party is also called Bharat Jalao Party and Manush Jalao Party in the play) a divisive force. Theatre groups are adapting tunes for the song in the play according to local folk song flavours and traditions.One of the characters highlights the purported danger emerging from a party that wants to divide people on religious lines, indicating the BJP. This is the same party which withdrew all currency, and created trouble for all of us one of the characters says, indicating the demonetisation drive of November 2016. The play speaks about armed rallies during Ram Navami and divisive forces trying to find their feet in Bengal.One character in the play, named Chetri, purportedly representing the Darjeeling Hills, highlights how Banerjee solved the months-long problem in the Hills by travelling there on several occasions to bring peace. Sidhartha Kishore Roy Bhandari, head of the theatre group Kisholoy Natya Sanastha, which has been roped in to cover West Midnapore district, said, We have performed at 25 places in the last three days. We have adopted the tune of Jhumur dance (traditional dance of Purulia) for the main song. We are holding shows at street corners and large public meetings were ministers and party leaders address the people, and also (organising) independent shows.Recalling a show they did in Debra, in Kharagpur subdivision of the district, at 11 on Tuesday night, Bhandari said, The response from the people is tremendous. Representatives in the theatre groups said they hold shows from 8 am to 11 am and then 5 pm to 11 pm in an effort to avoid the afternoon heat. Each group is paid Rs 1,500 per show, and according to people participating in the campaign there is much demand for such plays in the states rural areas.So many requests from villagers and local party leaders are pouring in to perform in their areas. We are trying our best to get some time out and visit most place, Bhandari said. The best about theatre is that we the response from the crowd is immediateit is good.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

MahinshaS MAHINSHAAthaazha pashnikkarundo? (Is anyone out there hungry, needing dinner?), the unexpected call from a man standing on the footpath at Manaveeyam road took passers-by by surprise, on Sunday afternoon.Looking at the source of that call gave them an even bigger shock. Here was someone, standing with his hands tied together in the front, on a small mount of raw rice, with blood dripping down his face, hands and legs, and forming a small pool on top of the rice.It was the Manaveeyam Street Collectives protest against the murder of Madhu, an Adivasi youth, by a mob in Attappady.On Thursday, the hungry, hapless man was surrounded by the mob, which accused him of stealing rice and other groceries worth Rs. 200. He was assaulted, shamed in public, and handed over to the police.He succumbed to his internal injuries and died vomiting blood, in the police jeep, on the way to the hospital.The only way to reactFor theatre actor Bilas Nair, there was no other way he could have reacted to the gruesome murder, than through this public performance.That call Athaazha pashnikkarundo? is reminiscent of a time when those with enough for their own survival, ensured that those around them also did not go hungry to bed. What we saw last week is a stark contrast to that. Here was a frail man, who was accused of stealing food because he was hungry. None of those who gathered there, to beat him up, had a prick of conscience at the thought of a man going hungry. Not only that, they proceeded to assault and murder him, says Krishnan Balakrishnan of the Manaveeyam Collective.The incident has shook the public conscience and led to an outpouring of grief and anger over the past two days across the State."

5b14132d9855b7624637cca0,Sustaining the Amma Unavagams,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sustaining-the-amma-unavagams/article22719053.ece,2018-02-11,"Nourishment guaranteed:Despite a decline in footfalls, the Amma Canteens continue to be a vital source of sustenance for lakhs of people across the State.V GanesanSekar. D was observing this newspapers team of reporters as he sat cross-legged on the tiled floor. Then, he abandoned his dinner  chappathis stacked on a steel plate  walked up to us, and joined his palms together. Please dont close this canteen. I dont have any other way to feed myself, he said. Mr. Sekar had mistaken the reporters for a government review team.The Amma Unavagam on Seniamman Koil Street in north Chennai's Tondiarpet is critical to Mr. Sekar, who is homeless. I have all my meals here: Five idlis, sambhar and pongal for Rs. 10; two kinds of rice for another Rs. 10; and eight chappathis and dal for Rs. 12, he said.Tondiarpet falls within the Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar constituency, which sent former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to the Assembly in 2015 and 2016. There is affection for her here. She ensured my well-being before she died, said Mr. Sekar. Nearby, at the canteen in Corporation ward 42 on Ellayamuthali Street, a freshly-plucked marigold sat atop the section of the menu card on which the late Chief Ministers photo was printed.P. Muthusamy, a watchman at a house in Tiruchis Thillai Nagar, has been visiting the Amma Unavagam at Thennur almost daily since it opened in June 2013. Amma Unavagams continue to serve people like us even after the death of Jayalalithaa. Had she been alive, she would have taken steps to start more Unavagams and introduced a few more popular dishes, he said.It has been five years since the Amma Unavagam project was initiated. The canteen that former Chennai Mayor Saidai Duraisamy started on Pookara Street in Saidapet in 2006 provided the model. It was Jayalalithaas grand plan, comparable in vision to the noon meals scheme of her predecessor in the AIADMK, M. G. Ramachandran. Over the years, the number of canteens increased, making them a crucial mechanism of offering subsidised food to the masses. The secret of the success of Amma Canteen was the vision and leadership of Jayalalithaa. When bureaucrats were reluctant, she accepted the proposal put forth by the Chennai Corporation. Such a welfare measure is not even found in Cuba or China. So, we have to sustain it, said Mr. Duraisamy.Along with the expansion, negatives have surfaced too. Some of the canteens suffer from poor patronage today. The cost of running the heavily subsidised system was pushed to civic bodies, further straining their finances and raising questions over their sustainability. As officials have sought to plug leakages and rationalise the operations, complaints have emerged of mismanagement.Many experts say that while local bodies can manage the canteens, the government will have to provide budgetary support so they thrive. The concept of using self-help groups (SHGs) to operate the canteens is a good idea but has to be expanded and the groups should be effectively handled, they say.Bleeding civic bodiesThose who are part of the Amma Unavagam ecosystem know that a crisis is looming.On January 8, the Chennai Corporation collected Rs. 8.62 lakh in sales from its 407 canteens. The average sales per day was more than Rs. 15 lakh a few years ago, said Mr. Duraisamy. Officials say the Corporation has sold 48.15 crore idlis, 17.33 crore plates of variety rice and 21.61 crore chappathis in the past five years.Rumours seem to have fuelled the decline in patronage. Sales have dropped to just Rs. 1,100 per day. Employees and residents are scared that the canteen may be shifted to some other locality, said a member of the SHG that runs a canteen in Kodambakkam.Madurai Corporations Revenue Department officials say that of their 12 canteens, only six touched the collection target of Rs. 3,600 a day in 2017. Others fell short by at least Rs. 1,000 each day. While all the canteens in the city put together made around Rs. 1.3 crore in 2015, sales plunged to Rs. 1.25 crore in 2016. It dipped by several lakhs in 2017. We incur a loss of at least Rs. 35 lakh each month. Apart from the regular purchase of rice, pulses, vegetables, and curd, we pay Rs. 7,000 for maintenance per day, he says.The 10 canteens run by the Tirunelveli Corporation sell 3.6 lakh idlis, 87,000 plates of curd rice and 90,000 plates of sambhar rice every month. The Corporation spends Rs. 24.06 lakh for preparing and serving the food monthly while the revenue hovers at just over Rs. 10 lakh. We are already in the red and are incurring a loss of Rs. 14 lakh every month and over Rs. 1.68 crore a year by running the Amma Canteens, said an official.The 12 canteens operated by the Coimbatore Corporation serve over 2,500 and over 1,500 customers a day for breakfast and lunch respectively. Corporation sources said the civic body lost Rs. 15.77 lakh over Amma Unavagams in 2016-17. In 2012-13, the loss was Rs. 11.65 lakh.The Tiruchi Corporation spends about Rs. 1.1 lakh daily from its general fund to run its 11 canteens but gets a revenue of just Rs. 30,000 a day. The cost of vegetables, oil, coconut, milk and fuel has almost doubled since the introduction of the scheme, said a senior official.New patronsAt the canteen of Chennais ward 53, located in the industrial area of Old Washermanpet, in-charge P. Susheela readily admits that sales have been slow. So slow that daily shifts have been reduced from three to two. The Thanganatchithiram SHG has been operating the canteen since April 2013. They began with 13 members; there are 11 now.During 2013-15, we sold meals worth Rs. 4,500-5,000 each day. The amount hovers at around Rs. 1,000-2,000 now, she said. Staff had to come in as early as 3 a.m. in the initial years to begin working on the idli batter. 5 a.m. suffices these days.There is no panic, though. Members pointed out that three other canteens have opened in the vicinity since, taking away patrons. The last  53(a)  was started near the new bus stand to accommodate the heavy demand. They dont have a kitchen, so we cook and deliver, said D. Nithya. They retain patrons from the densely-populated neighbourhood and have even gained new ones  Hindi-speaking workers of a nearby biscuit factory.It is not that there are no problems. Ms. Susheela withdraws when the topic comes up, leaving Ms. Nithya to take over. The latter signals at the smoke in the kitchen and points to the still exhaust fan. We keep complaining, but no one comes to repair that. The water pump too, is not working any more, she said. The SHG members say they were berated by Corporation officials after a Tamil newspaper recently reported on such infrastructural problems. Then, last week, two of the staff were asked to leave.The women are paid Rs. 300 for a days work. They report for either the 5 a.m. - 1 p.m. or the 1 p.m. - 9 p.m. shift. I intend to complain about this to Corporation officials at the zonal office tomorrow, said Ms. Nithya.Operating through SHGsSHG members in Chennai claim the zonal health officials make hasty decisions that weaken their leaders who play a key role in organising women.We formed the groups and motivated them for the welfare scheme. Our leadership is weakening now. So, we are unable to motivate the team of workers in the canteen, says an organiser of SHGs in Chennai.A team of women drawing a very small salary of Rs. 9,000 per month can be motivated only by keeping the team intact. Bureaucrats do not understand this aspect. They just transfer employees to another canteen. New employees prove a misfit, increasing attrition, said another SHG member of an Amma Canteen in Chennai.Many employees in Chennai claimed that the Corporation Health Department officials were not providing essential items for the normal functioning of the canteens. However, officials, who admitted to a reduction of sales by 35-45% in many canteens, said a few decisions were made only to reduce pilferage by employees.A senior official of the Madurai Corporations Health Department said that some low-performing centres suffer from poor access.There have been suggestions that the Corporation shift some canteens to more prominent locations, such as the Mattuthavani bus stand or the railway station.Yet, many officials stress the importance of the Amma Unavagam project. Madurai Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar said the project continues to be a flagship initiative of the State government.All centres are continuing to generate demand. The poor continue to be hugely benefited by this, he said.Remedial measuresP. Kuganantham, former Chennai City Health Officer who was involved in the conceptualising of the scheme, suggested a few measures for course correction. The quality [of food] has come down. From what I hear from those still in service, some centres in the periphery are not functioning at all, he said.Our people are not prepared to believe in the capability of women from self-help groups. You have to make these SHGs independent. Further, the Unavagams cannot be a programme of the local bodies at all. They cannot afford to allocate their revenues to a scheme like this. If the Amma Unavagams were to raise prices, they will be able to run on their own without help from Corporations, he added.To involve the local community, Mr. Kuganantham suggested roping in unemployed but qualified women from the vicinity of the centres to help operate them on an honorary basis.In the non-food-serving time, these centres can sell groceries and vegetables. This will also increase the carry-home salary of the women working there.(With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez and Deepu Sebastian Edmond in Chennai, Sanjana Ganesh in Madurai, P.

He came out of it only when he needed food. He never stole anything. Instead he pleaded with people for rice and provisions. A loner, he was hesitant to talk to people. People started terming him a thief when he ignored their questions, said Malli, struggling to contain her emotions.On many occasions, he had been beaten up by those involved with the timber mafia when he was spotted inside the forest under suspicious circumstances, she said. Earliertoo, local people had filed cases against him for theft. But there was no proof. If they had not killed him, Madhu may have lived in the forest without disturbing anyone. Those who killed him should be punished severely, said Malli, a daily wage earner."

They charge between Rs. 80 and Rs. 100 per 77 kg paddy bag from which they pay labour and electricity charges and also repay loans. These mills are like cottage industries and are run by small land holders, explained A.C. Mohan, Federation secretary. He said hulling was just just like job work undertaken by flour mills in cities where people bring in rice or pulses for grinding and pay the charges.

Food likings, as I have often said, are subjective. But several years ago, when the organisers of a street food festival in Delhi almost sat on my head, I gave in and went and judged the festival.It was an eye-opener. I ate a lot of good stuff, but the one that I recall vividly  and it won the first prize as well  was the Bihari meat dish there. It was delicious, and ever since I have been looking out for this dish.Garlic bulbSay Bihari food, and the image that pops up in your mind is that of litti-chokha. I like that as well, but what truly makes my mouth water is the States lamb curry. Its not a rich dish, like a korma, but is a delightful combination of disparate flavours. What gives it its characteristic taste is a garlic bulb that is cooked with the meat. The garlic is whole yet nice and soft when the curry gets ready. You squeeze it and mix the pulp with the rice and gravy, and get a sweet and sharp twist that gives the dish its special taste.It was because of this fascination for Bihari mutton that I had been searching high and low for a place where I could get some. There are a few Bihar food eateries and restaurants in town, but then I heard about a place in Indirapuram which I wanted to try out.The place is called Masala Queen and has branches mostly in the east  including Ghaziabad and Noida. I went to the Indirapuram one, which is in a place called Gulshan Homz Market in Vaibhav Khand. They do home delivery up to Vasundhara and Vaishali (Phone number: 9910909277).I wanted to have their Champaran meat  also called Ahuna meat. This is cooked with black pepper and desiccated coconut. And, of course, a whole garlic bulb.I found the place with some difficulty. I called them up and two helpful men came on a two-wheeler and took me riding pillion to where my car was parked. And from there, we reached Masala Queen, which turned out to be quite a spacious restaurant.I could see earthenware pots on log fires. The food is served in a handi, which I have always believed adds to the taste of whatever it contains. I guess its the feel of the earth. I mean tea in a kullar tastes so much better than that in Wedgwood, right?I asked for some Champaran mutton and chicken and meanwhile looked at the menu card. It includes various kinds of Mughlai parathas  with vegetables, egg, chicken, paneer and mutton (Rs. 60-230). It has kathi rolls (Rs. 49-210), chicken and meat curries served with rotis, litti, rice or parathas (Rs. 130-150), litti-choka (Rs. 60) and even Banarasi chai (Rs. 20).The chicken curry (1 kg) is for Rs. 790 and the mutton curry (1 kg) for Rs. 990. And, of course, you can buy a plate of the chicken or mutton dish with your choice of cereals. Chicken with rice or four tawa rotis is for Rs. 130, meat with lachcha paratha is for Rs. 170.I took the handis home and we had a great dinner. The meat curry was excellent, with juicy pieces of lamb in thick gravy flavoured with pepper. And, of course, the garlic!The chicken was rather good, too, though it was richer than the meat dish. The gravy was again nicely flavoured, and the pieces had been cooked just right.I am happy that my search for Champaran meat has yielded fruit  or dinner, I should say. And I am happy to have my food served in a mitti ki handiya. Now I think I shall plant something in the empty pot. Possibly a garlic bulb."

5b14171f9855b7624637ce57,Life in a deadly democracy,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/life-in-a-deadly-democracy/article22861434.ece,2018-02-27,"Yet another murder involving Indias political parties has taken place in north Kerala but this time it is different. It does not follow the pattern that we have got used to. The parties involved are not the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). A Youth Congress leader, S.P. Shuhaib, was killed recently, and the police have identified the killers who surrendered as CPI(M) workers. It is reported in the States leading newspapers that one of them confessed that the district leadership of their party was not merely in the know of it but had actually instigated the action. While we cannot be sure of the veracity of this statement, it is believable. A minister in the State cabinet is on record that in the 1980s, the leadership of his district in south Kerala had discussed the elimination of political rivals.Political vendettaIn a history of violence in Kannur district, the CPI(M) has lost many of its workers to killings by the RSS. This removes credibility from the claims of the Bharatiya Janata Party that the RSS is a victim of violence in Kerala; it is actually a perpetrator and not only deserves no sympathy but also its actions should be called out. The nation knows of its commitment to violence, evident in the assassination of Gandhi. However, I am here concerned about the situation in Kerala today. Here and now the promise of power for the RSS, through its proxy the BJP, is no more than a glint in the eye of Amit Shah.The CPI(M) however is a major player on the political stage of the State and its actions must be viewed sharply. By now this partys workers stand accused of killing widely across the political spectrum. Apart from this most recent killing of a young Congressman, its members are accused of the killing, in 2012, of T.P. Chandrasekharan, a former comrade who left the fold to form the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP), and of Muhammad Aslam of the Indian Union Muslim League, in 2016. The fig leaf of secularism, or more so of fighting communal forces, does not hold up as it would be difficult to argue that party workers of the Congress or the RMP are communal in any way. These murders are to be seen for what they are, a form of political vendetta and nothing more inspired. Unlike the Maoists who do not believe in parliamentary democracy, the CPI(M), while decrying Indian democracy as bourgeois, is happy to partake of the loaves and fishes of office. A reminder that the violence unleashed by those with access to state power has little to do with some lofty ideal came recently when a gang of men assaulted a pregnant woman over a property dispute in Kozhikode district. The woman was so bodily harmed that she lost her child. Press reports are that seven Left activists have been arrested, including a local-level CPI(M) leader.Going a little deeper into the so-called political violence in Kerala, we are able to see a frightful pattern. Frightful not in terms of the violence, which is brutal even at the surface, but in terms of the class element clinging to it. In almost all cases the actual killing is undertaken by young men of the working classes while the party leadership rests with a class that does not soil its hands with labour of any kind. At the national level, so-called intellectuals lead the CPI(M) while its rank and file are of the subaltern class. It is members of this underclass that cannot hope to ever lead the party who find themselves in the frontline of the assault against opponents named class enemies. The leadership in Kerala is seen not just as property-owning but perceptibly rich. They are distinctly bourgeois also in the sense of advancing the career of their offspring. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the young men who commit murder in the name of a political ideology that they very likely do not comprehend will ever own as much.It is this social distance that makes the situation approximate feudalism as it is understood. Under feudalism the lord owned the land which was farmed out to peasants who not only paid taxes for the privilege of cultivating it but also had to bear arms for their lord in the event of war. The striking similarity with the situation in Kerala today where a property-owning leadership directs unemployed youth to eliminate political opponents is evident. It is rumoured that in return for their murderous services these youth have their families provided for by the party.Shroud of silenceGandhi was able to see that for the poor, god appears in the form of bread. In the formal democracy that is India, where the equipping of the poor with capabilities that set them free has not been a priority of the state, it appears that politics appears in the form of food. Despite Keralas much-vaunted social indicators, economic inequality here is the highest in India, and the subaltern can perhaps yet be encouraged to kill in return for material gain. Of course, the case of assailants mesmerised into seeing an aesthetic in violence cannot be ruled out. What is uniform, however, is that the killers are foot soldiers of a party which is firmly in the hands of a clerisy that teaches but does not itself do.Unsurprisingly, the Malayalee nomenklatura has remained silent on the recent killings. The communist intelligentsia have always glorified necessary violence while delegating murder to the working class. Condemnation of the use of violence in a democracy does not rest on moral considerations. Actually, no criterion external to democracy itself is required. Violence is to be rejected on the ground that it is contrary to the essence of democracy, which is deliberation through public reasoning. When aimed at eliminating political opponents it eliminates the space for deliberation and disables democracy. In a contest between political parties, most parties represent the people. Therefore, to kill a representative of another party is to set upon a section of the people themselves. Democracy is legitimised by the existence of the demos or the people. Parties that turn against the demos delegitimise themselves.But surely, supporters of the CPI(M) cannot be singled out for their silence. There is little outrage in Kerala in the face of the visible butchery. In a democracy the demos can hardly escape blame for the violence, for they are expected to discipline the political parties. Keralas identity-conscious populace fails to converge on the greater common good but effectively makes common cause on a form of welfarism. Welfarism is a re-casting of democracy as the citizens entitlement to unlimited public services without the responsibility to deliberate upon the common good and how to attain it. We should hardly be surprised that in such a society, this February 22 a mentally-challenged Adivasi was dragged out of the forest and beaten to death by a mob. And it seems Keralas political class can never be separated from violence. A man present on the occasion, and reportedly clicking selfies with the youth while he was being humiliated, has been linked to the Indian Union Muslim League. It speaks volumes for our democracy that a hungry citizen is killed for stealing rice while politicians facing charges of corruption never leave the stage.Pulapre Balakrishnan is Professor of Ashoka University and Senior Fellow of IIM Kozhikode"

Their qualification was proposed to be increased to Intermediate as better understanding of the technology was required, sources said.It is unlikely that the manner of appointing the dealers would change from the present system of Revenue Divisional Officer notifying the vacancies and conducting a written test of SSC standard, which would carry 50% marks with the remaining 50% for oral interview. The test, if the qualification is increased, will be of Intermediate standard.There are 1,037 fair price shop dealer vacancies against a total of 17,035 shops in Telangana. While vacancies for 982 shops were caused by removal, resignation due to low commission and death of dealers, the remaining 55 were new shops. This apart, dealers were frequently suspended for cases booked against them under the Essential Commodities Act and reinstated after they were absolved of the charges. On an average, there were 1,200 vacancies, a senior official said, adding that the cases were mainly for detection of variation in the commodities supplied to the shops and diversion of stocks. While contemplating increase in educational qualification of dealers, the Civil Supplies department has recently written to the government, seeking lifting of ban on their recruitment, which has been in vogue since October, 2015, to facilitate rationalisation of existing shops. The department has also referred to the demand of dealers to implement the National Food Security Act, which assured them payment of Rs. 70 per a quintal of rice as commission. The State and Centre would equally share the burden of Rs. 70. The matter was under consideration of the Chief Minister. The government had carried out distribution of ration from shops where vacancies existed by entrusting the responsibility to nearby dealers. The maximum number of 87 vacancies were in Kamareddy district while Mancherial with only 4 was at the bottom.Mr. Battula Ramesh Babu, president of the Telangana State Ration Dealers Welfare Association, said raising educational qualification of dealers was not warranted because the new technology was much like operating cell phones which even illiterate people handled. He justified resignation of dealers because they had got a pittance of Rs. 2,000 at Rs. 20 a quintal while the establishment charges were Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 10,000 a month."

At right, children take part in the Kuthiyottam ritual at the Attukal Devi Temple in Thiruvananthapuram.Special Arrangement & S. GopakumarThe annual festivals at the Attukal Devi Temple in the State capital and the Chettikulangara Devi Temple in Alappuzha district have shot into unusual prominence for the ritualistic body piercing ceremonies known as Kuthiyottam and Chooral Muriyal.At Attukal in the State capital, the practice of keeping around 1,000 teenage boys on the temple premises for five days, leading up to the grand finale when thousands of women arrive in the city to offer pongala (made with rice and jaggery) to the female deity, has come in for criticism from the States Director General of Prisons R. Sreelekha.She raised the question of how elders could allow hooks to be pierced into the sides of the boys, even ritualistically, in gross violation of their rights to protection and security.Calling the practice cruelty to the kids, she wrote in her blog: Parents conspire with temple authorities to put their children through rigorous mental and physical abuse for five days... And on the final day, each of them will be decked up with yellow clothes, garlands, jewellery and make-up on face, including lipstick, and made to stand in a queue for their last unexpected torture. An iron hook, tiny though it is, will be pierced into their skin on their flanks. They scream. Blood comes out. A thread will be symbolically knotted through the hooks to symbolise their bond with divinity. Then the hooks are pulled out and ash roughly applied on the wounds! All this for (the) temple deity!Government silentMs. Sreelekha is Keralas first woman IPS officer. Her writing earned the wrath of right wing sympathisers. She has received no support the CPI(M)-led government. On Friday, the ritual took place as in the previous years.A fortnight ago, on February 22, religious fervour found its expression in the ritual called Chooral Muriyal at the Chettikulangara Devi temple in Alappuzha. It was thronged by thousands of devotees on the Bharani day in the Malayalam calendar. Those who offer Kuthiyottam performances to the deity adopt young boys aged between 8 and 14 from other families. These boys are then taken care of by their adopted households for the next 10 days. They are taught the ritual dance of Kuthiyottam with the help of asan s (masters). The boys are then offered to the goddess.In the ritual of Chooral Muriyal, either sides of the boys midriffs are pierced and gold strings passed through their piercings. One end of the thread is tied around the neck. Later, children with painted faces, an arecanut fixed on the tip of a knife held high over their head, are garlanded and taken in a procession to the temple, their pain drowned by beating of drums and music. At the temple, young boys dance facing the sanctum. In the end, the gold threads are pulled out and offered to the deity along with drops of blood on it, in a symbolic sacrifice.The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KeSCPCR) in 2016 banned the practice, noting that it should be abolished from society, like the practice of sati. Dismissing a petition filed by an organisation, which sought the ban to be overturned, the Kerala High Court last month observed that children should not be subjected to any form of physical or mental suffering in the name of such ceremonies.However, despite a ban, at least 12 households performed the ritual this year.23 persons bookedAfter this years festival, the police registered a case against 23 persons for defying the court ban and performing the ritual under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and Section 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code. The parents and sponsors of 23 children have been booked, district police chief S. Surendran told The Hindu .The ritual is performed as a wish-fulfilling offering to the deity. The masters who train the children in Kuthiyottam performances maintain that the boys are offered to the goddess to bring her joy, and the ritual cannot be be seen as a sacrifice.B. Harikrishnan, former president and governing council member of the Sreedevi Vilasam Hindu Matha Convention, Chettikulangara, an organisation of devotees, said it was an old custom and should be allowed to continue, adding, We are moving the Supreme Court against the High Courts verdict."

Vijaya Ram had been collecting the seed varieties from different parts of the country to cultivate them in the natural farming method at his two fields at Tarakaturu and Peda Muttevi villages in Krishna district since 2012.I have distributed the seed of the 200 paddy varieties to the nearly 6,000 farmers, who have pledged to join me to develop the seed bank, Mr. Vijaya Ram told The Hindu .

The Jeevamrutam is a liquid prepared by mixing cow dung and jaggery with water and cow urine.Fibre valueCultivation of the few Indian seed varieties  Navara, Narayana Kamini, Bahuroopi, Ratnachodi and Khulakar  has yielded an incredible result in terms of quality of grain and survival rate of the seed in the agriculture seasons, rabi and kharif.The Navara variety rice has recently been tested by the Hyderabad-based nutrition experts who found above 40% of fibre value in it. We want to develop the seed bank that will have scientific data of all the varieties, added Mr. Vijaya Ram. He and his team provide any of the 200 seed varieties to those who cherish to preserve some quantity of the seed for future.The seed bank does not boast about the quantity of yield. But the quality of the seed and nutritious values in it are better compared to those in the paddy varieties that are cultivated with fertilizers and pesticides, Mr. Vijaya Ram said."

Faced with a health emergency after decades of failed clean-up efforts, Indonesia is now serious about going ahead with a seemingly impossible goal  to make the Citarums water drinkable by 2025 as nearly 30 million people rely on it for irrigation, washing and even drinking water. At nearly 300 kilometres long, the river is a key source for hydroelectric power for Indonesias most populated island, Java, and tourism hotspot Bali. The World Bank called it the most polluted river in the world a decade ago and research has shown it to have high levels of toxic chemicals which include 1,000 times more lead than the U.S. standard for safe drinking water, as an estimated 280 tonnes of industrial waste are dumped in it every day. In January, Indonesia decided to get tough with factory owners who ignore disposal rules, with CCTV cameras being installed along the banks to scan for offenders dumping waste under the cover of darkness.

Modernity needs a mourning wall to bemoan the death of a language or the missingness of a seed. In fact, the collective death of cultures as genocide, extermination and extinction have few rituals of memory, few moments of commemoration.Death of a cultureThe death of a language in particular has a particular poignancy. When a language dies, a way of life dies, a way of thinking disappears, a connection between word and world is lost. Often, today, we mourn the death of the last speaker, treating him as a vestige of an entire past. Newspapers often report the death of a last tribal speaker, scarcely mentioning the death of a culture that preceded it. There is a hypocrisy and ambivalence which captures modernitys attitude to the obsolescent and near extinct.There is a failure of story-telling where the death of a language becomes a litany of numbers. Yet there is fatalism behind numbers. Futurists warn that over 3,000 languages might disappear over the next ten years. The danger to minority languages and oral languages is high. Almost any census on languages is a ritual of mourning.Development and the institutions of development like school mutually guarantee the disappearance of minority languages and dialects. A school generally teaches in a majority language. The pithiest critique of such schools was made by the Kannada writer U.R. Ananthamurthy, who said India is a country where the illiterate worker speaks five-seven languages and the convent schoolchild speaks one.One group that is steadfastly fighting to keep languages alive is the Peoples Linguistic Survey of India (PSLI). The chairman of the PSLI, Ganesh N. Devy, a literary critic who spent years saving tribal languages, remarked that clerical definitions can be genocidal and facilitate extinction. Mr. Devy said that when the Government of India decided to define a language as a form of life marked by a script, it triggered the erasure of oral languages. India in many ways is an oral society that understands the culture of orality. Today one needs to create a new social contract between orality, textuality and digitality to keep pluralism alive.Mr. Devy added that the silence of the tribe began in the moment of this legislation. The PLSI also noted that extinction of a language and the death of an ecology often go together. In India coastal languages are dying as the coast and the livelihoods of the coast are being destroyed ecologically and culturally. The intrusions of the corporate world are forcing fishing communities inward and in the process they give up their languages. Sometimes as an anthropologist I often think of the hypocrisy called corporate social responsibility (CSR) and wish 5% of CSR were devoted to saving languages and crafts. Sadly, corporations lack such an imagination. No corporation thinks of language loss as a loss of human capital. What we need now are chartered accountants of culture.Losing a worldLosing a language is losing a cosmology, a set of myths, rituals of competence. Yet no cost-benefit ever calculates the cultural cost of language extinction. It is seen as obsolescence, a literal consequence of modernity and development. The sadness in India is that it is one of the great repositories of language in the world. We need a notion of heritage which can save agricultural and linguistic diversity together. A nation which has 140,000 varieties of rice and over 780 languages is a trustee of diversity. We need to invent a citizenship and a commons of cultures as part of our democratic imagination. A democracy that fails to be inventive about culture eventually becomes a nominal, rudimentary and standardised world. A people need to feel a language is relevant, possesses dignity, provides competence, identity and meaning for it to survive. The guarantee for such a world is rarely available. A language disappears as a new generation enters modernity, abandoning memory and older forms of competence.One needs a special prayer for a language going extinct. It is restricted to a few elder speakers and as one confronts the last speaker, science objectivises her into a museum exhibit. The death of the last speaker and the breast-beating that follows are among the farcical exercises of a modern culture that museumises these forms of life and lets them go extinct.When the art critic, Ananda Kentish Muthu Coomaraswamy, claimed that the museum smelled of death and formaldehyde, he could have been thinking about the way society looks at an extinct language. It collects information tapes of a dying language, freezes its grammar but lets a community die. The indifference of modernity and its idolatry of progress is best caught in the ritual of language loss. I remember Albert Camus once said, statistics do not bleed  but as one discovers that a language becomes extinct once every 14 days, even numbers seem to be in mourning.One senses this as one looks at the UNESCO atlas of world languages in danger. One reads that 230 languages have become extinct since 1950. Yet what one discovers is that one is creating abstract information without the innovations of a community. What one needs is a celebration of multilingualism. The myth of the speaker holding forth in one language is a poor myth of a Macaulayite world. One needs a kaleidoscope of spaces where different languages are juxtaposed and one switches between them as one shifts context. Translation too becomes an important act of citizenship. Even here the bias towards monolingualism is clear. Ananthamurthy once suggested that the Third World needs a new model of UNESCO for translations. Translation today is a one-way process. Local and regional languages are translated into English but one rarely thinks of translating from Tamil to Spanish. One needs to move to a more polyglot world to sustain a vision of diversity.In fact, language loss is a part of a bigger problematic of diversity.Shiv Visvanathan is a member of Compost Heap, a group of activists and academics exploring alternative imaginations and futures"

The takeover of land and shelters given to tribespeople by private parties was the real problem.The State government had already taken steps to address these issues. The court, meanwhile, appointed lawyer P. Deepak as amicus curiae to assist the court in the case.The court on Tuesday initiated the suo motu proceedings on the basis of a letter written by Justice K. Surendra Mohan, a High Court Judge, seeking the intervention of the court. The letter said that Madhu was beaten to death by a mob at Agali, Attappady, allegedly for stealing a small quantity of rice. The judge pointed out that there were lots of schemes for the welfare of tribal people, besides various poverty alleviation programmes.If the victim was forced to steal rice because he had nothing to eat, it revealed that the schemes were not reaching the needy. This calls for a revamp of the implementation procedures to ensure that they reached the intended beneficiaries, the letter stated.The letter further said the fact that the tribal youth was attacked and lynched by a mob showed that they had scant respect for the law. The judge felt that one could not dispute the fact that there had been a serious lapse on the part of the law enforcement machinery.The letter, while seeking positive directions, to prevent the recurrence of such incidents said that an effective investigation and wholehearted prosecution of the offenders were the need of the hour.If the victim was forced to steal rice, it shows that the schemes are not reaching the needyDivision BenchKerala High Court"

But over the years, the sparrows seemed to have disappeared and today they are a rare sight.Today, children are explained about sparrows through pictures and even at times taken to a zoo, according to J.V. Ratnam of Green Climate.There are a number of reasons for the disappearance of the friendly bird, which were once part of our daily life. And the reason attributed by experts include felling of trees, lack of cavity nesting, growth of concrete jungle, absence of native plants and hedgerows, rampant growth of cell towers and use of chemical fertilisers in agriculture besides lack of food.Come Sankranti, members of Paryavarana Margadarsi Vaisakhi is busy educating the people on how the little birds can be brought back and stay amidst us.According to Manjulatha, professor of zoology from Andhra University, there are three to four main reasons for the disappearance of sparrows from Visakahpatnam city. The primary reason being the sudden growth of concrete jungle that has reduced the scope of cavity nesting and how can they live if they cannot build a nest to stay. The second is lack of food. The sparrows mainly feed on grains and earlier both at home and at the grocery stores the grains would be packed in gunny bags that allowed a bit of spilling. Now with the use of sealed plastic bags, the birds are devoid of food, says the professor.Adding on to the professor, Mr. J.V. Ratnam says: Another main reason is the use of pesticides in agriculture. The sparrows are farmer-friendly birds, as they feed on the insects. But ever since pesticides are being used, they are dying after feeding on the insects laced with pesticides. Even the young ones are dying.S. Vijaya Kumar, founder president of PMV, says that to bring back the birds, one can keep water and rice husk for the birds in mud bowls and place them on the balcony. Hanging collection of rice hulls/rice husks will be favourable for sparrows and other birds also, he adds."

Lakshmi NarayananE_LakshmiNarayananWith the harvest festival of Pongal just a couple of days away, the work on the preparation of jaggery (gur) is in full swing in different parts of the district.Jaggery is used in the preparation of sweet rice for offering to Sun God during the Pongal festival. The sweet rice prepared using jaggery used to have a mouth-watering taste.Jaggery is a sweetener and is considered as a healthy replacement for sugar.Jaggery manufacturing work is nearing completion in Nedungulam, Kunjampalayam, Moolapathai, and Pudupalayam in Edappadi block and in Vellalampatti and surrounding villages in Omalur block. A large number of skilled jaggery makers from different parts of Salem and the neighbouring districts are camping in these villages for the past couple of months. They are expected to return to their native places in a day or two to celebrate the festival.The jaggery unit owners procure the cane from the fields of the farmers itself, due to which they could get it at a reasonable price. They themselves engage the workers to cut the cane and later transport the stock to their units. Jaggery-making process follows three steps  extraction, clarification and concentration. The sugarcane is processed through machines in order to extract all the sweet juice or sap.The juice is stored in large containers so that any residue or sediment is settled at the bottom of the containers. The juice is then strained to produce a clear liquid. The juice is later placed in huge flat bottomed pans and boiled for hours, when the juice is stirred constantly. Stirring leads to only a yellow thick paste remaining in the pan. This paste is transferred in huge moulds where it is left to cool, until it becomes hard and becomes jaggery. The colour vary from light to dark brown.The personnel running the jaggery production units say that they are very cautious and are not mixing any chemicals during the production stage for adding colour. We are manufacturing and marketing the jaggery in its natural colour, the unit owners say.The jaggery of Salem district has good demand in various parts of the western districts. At present, a 30-kg sippam is being marketed for Rs. 1,200. Many traders from other districts visit the production centres and procure the jaggery directly."

It had been denied to them allegedly because their Aadhaar numbers were not linked to their BPL cards.

But, the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) in the State was not equipped currently to carry out weight-for-height measurements of under-5 children.We have taken up the matter of addressing SAM with the State government. Since measuring height for small children is tricky, this could be done using a mid-upper-arm-circumference tape.If the measurement is below 11.5 cm, it confirms that the child is severely malnourished. Anganwadi workers alone identify underweight children, so nobody else knows the number. That is why measuring height is crucial as SAM children have a higher probability of dying, over 10 times, compared to normal children, Mr. Zachariah said.Anaemic womenR. Kannan, director of the ICDS in the State, said prevalence of severe malnutrition among children was the result of a vicious cycle starting from unhealthy mothers.In Tamil Nadu, half of the women in child-bearing age are found to be anaemic, NFHS-4 data shows. Our target is to reduce malnutrition in women by 2% every year, Mr. Kannan said.Lack of sanitation could also play a role in influencing anaemia in women, he added.Mr. Zachariah said that States which had identified high levels of malnutrition had set up at least one nutrition rehabilitation centre per district to address the issue, for example, Madhya Pradesh. However, as Tamil Nadu was yet to identify the State-level occurrence of SAM through separate measures, it had only two nutrition rehabilitation centres overall in the State.Only if Tamil Nadu undertakes a State-level survey and intervention, high levels of SAM can be reduced in the State, experts say. Despite a well-functioning ICDS system and universal PDS, the malnutrition numbers are a cause of worry.Multi-sectoral approachAt a meeting organised by the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation on Tuesday, experts emphasised the need to follow an integrated approach to addressing the problem of malnutrition in the State. Since different departments, from health to nutrition to sanitation departments influenced outcomes, experts said that only a multi-sectoral approach could address the issue.Professor M.S. Swaminathan also emphasised the need for nutrition security. The first 1,000 days of a childs nutrition is very important. Similarly, for adults it is not only rice or wheat but a diversified diet that would address nutrition concerns. The Food Security Act talks about 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month. But that is not going to be enough. We need to move from food security to nutrition security, he said."

The trio could be apprehended with the alerts from the Locked Houses Monitoring System to the police control room.Superintendent of Police S.V. Rajasekhar Babu said that the petty traders at the bus station commercial complex had registered with the LHMS app and got linked with the control room. After closing their shops close to midnight, the shopkeepers had switched on the LHMS equipment at their shops and left.After a while, two of the gang sneaked into a shop and started collecting the goods while the third one kept guard outside. The unusual movements inside made the LHMS equipment send an alert to the control room. In a couple of minutes, the night duty cops swooped on the shop and nabbed the trio, who were sent for remand on Monday.Appreciating the shopkeepers for installing the LHMS equipment on their premises, the SP said this should serve as an example to all other shop-owners whose properties were vulnerable to theft.In spite of our vigorous campaign to register with the LHMS app to get free service when they are away from house, there is poor response from public. Even the bankers are not showing interest in installing the equipment and getting connected to the police control room. If the bank authorities have any reservations in linking with the police control room, they could get the alerts on their mobiles directly, for further action during non-working hours, Mr. Rajasekhar Babu said.DonatedThe V.Kota mandal police led by Kuppam circle inspector Raghavan and special branch head constable D.G. Ramurthy on Monday afternoon handed over blankets, clothes, books, stationary, rice bags and snacks all worth over Rs. 3 lakh to the Charity Wall wing administered by the district police at the District Headquarters Hospital here. The donations were pooled with the cooperation of school students and public groups. SP Rajasekhar Babu distributed them to the in-patients and their wards."

As many as 28 models of vertical garden set up in various parts of the 12-acre flower show ground is the cynosure of all eyes.Construction of vertical gardens are compulsory in many a province in China, as it is proved to eliminate atmospheric pollution and it could create carbon neutral situation, says P. Rajendran, Associate director of Research, RARS, Ambalavayal.Not only ornamental plants but leafy vegetables also could be cultivated in the vertical structure, Dr. Rajendran said. The structures, each between five metre to eight metre in height, are constructed with fiber and steel. The construction cost for the structure would be around Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 5,000 a sq metre depending on the design, he said.Other attractions of the show include a rose garden with 1,650 varieties of roses, dahlia garden on 3.5 acres with more than 5,500 varieties, gladiolus plants on 2 acres of land, nearly 10,000 varieties of cactus, succulent plants and imported flower plants, besides orchids and ornamental plants brought from various parts of the country.A rare collection of 100 rice varieties, ginger and turmeric rhizomes, as well as a variety of tuber crops are proving to be a huge draw. Apart from this, value-added products processed at RARS and Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK ), Ambalavayal, from different fruits including litchi, jackfruit, plantain and strawberry are attracting visitors.Over two lakh people visited the show in a week, Dr. Rajendran said. We are also organising a six-day international symposium on orchids strawberry minor fruits and flowers from January 12 to January 16 to sensitise the farmers on the vast commercial potential of horticulture and floriculture in the district, he added.

5b14290f9855b744d63889be,Agriculture needs a reforms package,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/agriculture-needs-a-reforms-package/article22408233.ece,2018-01-10,"With rural economic anxieties acquiring a political voice, the expectation is that the Budget will focus on agriculture. For some time, the country has been in denial over the extent of the mess in the sector.Farm incomes are unattractive for a variety of reasons; the absurdity of policies features among them. The overriding objective of price stability, over time, has tilted farm policy in favour of the consumer, the numerically larger vote bank. Trade and price controls are highly restrictive, and mostly anti-farmer. Protection afforded to the inefficient fertilizer industry ensures that input costs are high. The farmer is forced to sell in the domestic market where prices tend to be lower than global agricultural prices. Research papers have quantified the degree of anti-agriculture bias in the system. Farmers economic viability is rarely the primary consideration, although political rhetoric would suggest otherwise. Increasingly though, incompetence and politics have ensured that policies are failing to serve even consumers.Agri-markets are not free. Governments seek to influence prices, to smoothen them out. In the absence of state intervention, prices soar in bad weather years and plunge in good weather years, hurting consumers and farmers. The levers in governments hands are import and export controls, buffer stocks management and minimum support prices (MSPs).About MSPsPrime Minister Narendra Modi is under pressure to deliver on the 2014 poll promise of higher MSPs. The centrality of MSPs in vote-bank politics is well-known, but the economics of it is not sufficiently appreciated. The MSP, the price at which the government offers to procure from farmers, is an economic policy tool which requires technical acumen.A sensible policy would be to buy from farmers when market prices are depressed and sell stocks in the open market when prices are elevated. In the first scenario, if the MSP is pegged higher than the market price, the procurement will raise the market price, boosting farm incomes. In the latter, by offloading its stocks at a price lower than the market price, government can cushion consumers against excessive inflation. The buyers of the subsidised sales (an efficient Public Distribution System) are directly benefitted, but as the sales also lead to lower prices in the open market, all consumers gain.Procurement works effectively only if trade controls and stocks management are aligned with it. How these tools tend to be deployed in a counterproductive manner was evident in the example of pulses in 2016-17. Despite a bumper harvest, after a steep MSP hike and good rains, export controls and stocking limits for private traders were retained and a record volume of imports allowed to be shipped in. The resulting glut sent the market price down, below the MSPs, rendering it pointless. The looming losses set off farmer protests seeking even higher MSPs.The United Progressive Alliance governments MSP policy was blamed for the food prices inflation, from 2009 to 2013. The culprit, though, was poor management of food stocks. The government had been raising MSPs to reduce the gap between low domestic and high global agricultural prices. The launch of the National Food Security Mission and a global food prices crisis necessitated hikes more aggressive than were originally planned. The high MSP ensured that the increase in food grain production in the four-year period, 42 million metric tonnes, was more than double of what had been targeted. But the high MSP also edged out private traders, forcing a scale-up in procurement. Wheat and rice stocks surged but were not used to dampen market prices.Former Chief Economic Adviser Kaushik Basu has written about the mindset behind the reluctance to release stocks to cool rising prices. The argument was that selling at a price lower than the purchase price (MSP plus carrying costs) would inflict losses on the exchequer and add to the fiscal deficit. Since procurement spending is a sunk cost, not selling implied even higher fiscal losses. International wheat prices were 30% lower than in India, yet consumers were forced to pay more.A biasAgricultural economist Ashok Gulatis calculations show that even after four years of systematically aggressive hikes, Indian MSPs of rice and wheat are less than support prices in China and other Asian countries, betraying Indias bias in favour of consumers.This bias explains the deepening economic divide between the farm-dependent and the rest of the population, reflected in insecurities of even traditionally land-owning people.The narrative is that the bulk of agriculture is not sufficiently productive to be able to gainfully engage young rural Indians and so policy attention must be on building industry. Chinas experience challenges such notions. The Chinese economic reforms were kicked off in 1978 with an overhaul of agriculture. As farm prices were decontrolled, real per capita incomes began rising and, in just six years Chinese poverty levels halved, from 33% in 1978 to 15% in 1984. In contrast, Indias 1991 reforms bypassed agriculture altogether and instead focussed completely on industrial liberalisation. Indian poverty halved in 18 years from 45% in 1993 to 22% in 2011.The Budget presents an opportunity to revisit strategic choices. Nothing short of an overhaul of agriculture, resembling the industrial liberalisation of 1991, will work.Puja Mehra is a Delhi-based journalist"

Those, settled there, are cut off from our culture. We have several Ammavaru temples in Myanmar but they are not properly maintained. We dont have pundits, As a Telugu State we need to help the locals get back to our roots , said Mr. Naidu, who presently resides in India. He said Telugus, before British rule, went to Burma (now Myanmar) as traders and helped build the nation but later the Britishers took them (Telugus) as labourers to execute rail projects and plantation work. The sudden demand for Burma teak, rubber and (Rangoon) rice were also the reasons for the migration.He said the majority of migrant Telugus were from North Andhra region. The persistent drought those days forced them to leave for to Burma.He said during the British rule, Telugus had a vibrant role in the establishment of Burma and several cultural and social outfits were thriving. Even a Telugu newspaper - Andhra Mitra - was printed in the late 30s. Burma looked like second Telugu Desam. Telugus worked hard and prospered in rubber, teak wood, shipping, and plantation business., They also went to become owners of big enterprises in Burma, he said.He said Telugus at Myanmar was known as Moon, Mooni, Mouni. But by and large the Telugus are identified as Telang and Thailang . As per 1931 census, the highest linguistic population from India to Burma was Telugus.He said he wrote a book on Burma Telugu for the benefit of the locals got it printed there for distribution among the local Telugus.Andhra Pradesh Planning Commission Vice Chairman C.

The latest survey showed that paddy crops on 1.06 lakh hectares have withered and farmers let the cattle for grazing, officials told The Hindu .The crops were 75 to 80 days and entered the crucial milking to flowering stage when the rains failed. Farmers hoped there would be couple of spells during the middle of December and they could save crops at least in about 40,000 hectares but their hopes were dashed, the officials said.Farmers in Thiruvadanai taluk, considered the rice bowl of the district bore the brunt of the dry spell as crops raised in the entire 47,000 hectares  constituting one third of total cultivation area in the district withered.Sowing in the taluk began in September end and they were the first to loss the crops, they said.This year also the loss is near total, the officials said adding only farmers in Mudukulathur and parts of Kamuthi and Paramakudi could save crops raised in about 20,000 hectares. The only solace was that almost all the farmers have insured their crops under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), they said.While a majority of the farmers lost paddy crops, farmers in Kamuthi and Kadaladi blocks who raised millets and sun flower on about 3000 hectares tasted success as the drought resistant crops have reached the harvest stage, officials said. Besides, a section of farmers have raised chillies on 17,000 hectares and cotton on 2000 hectares and hopeful of saving the crops, they said.Officials suggested that it was time, the farmers switched over to the cultivation of millets and pulses instead of relying on paddy and burning their fingers. The district administration was taking steps to make available 100 multi-crop thrashers in each block to encourage farmers to switch over to millet cultivation, they added.

The World Bank declared it the most-polluted river in the world a decade ago, an description widely picked up by media and environmentalists.Dangerous to healthWaste levels can vary depending on how pollution is measured and the time of the year.But the Citarum is dangerous by almost any standard.Previous research has shown it has alarming levels of toxic chemicals -- including 1,000 times more lead than the US standard for safe drinking water.It regularly appears on most-polluted lists alongside Indias Ganges river, the Mississippi river in the United States and Chinas Yellow river.In January, Jakarta yanked responsibility away from local government, and vowed to get tough on business owners who ignore waste-disposal rules.Factories that fall short could have operating permits revoked.And CCTV cameras are to be installed along the rivers banks to keep an eye out for offenders dumping waste in the early morning hours to evade detection.Meanwhile, dredging equipment will be used to clean up the filthy river, said Djoko Hartoyo, a spokesman for the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.We are not playing around this time, he added.Were going in with a holistic approach so we are optimistic we can make Citarum clean again, just like it was 50 or 60 years ago.Industrial zoneIn the 1980s, a new industrial zone sprang up around the small town of Majalaya, about 170 kilometres east of Jakarta, and things quickly changed for the pristine river.Some 2,000 area textile factories have provided much-needed jobs, but it came with a heavy cost: about 280 tons of industrial waste are dumped into the river each day, according to government and environmental group data.Making matters worse, many locals think nothing of tossing their household waste into its toxic waters.Awful smellWhen it rains and my house gets flooded, the smell is awful, Achmad Fachrureza said from inside an inflatable dingy, as he navigated the rivers styrofoam containers, fabric, empty cans, plastic bottles and garbage bags.The 57-year-old villager said he was sacked from his job as a textile factory security guard after asking questions about the firms waste disposal system.Factory pipes dump waste directly into waters bubbling with chemical dyes used in textiles, creating an overwhelming stench. Most factories here have a waste disposal system, but they dont work properly because its just a formality, said Deni Riswandani from local environmental group Elingan.That poses a serious health risk, especially for the five million people living in the rivers basin.Many locals suffer from skin diseases like scabies and dermatitis, as well as respiratory infections from inhaling factory pollution.The number of people going to the health clinic is very high, Riswandani said.We keep reporting these issues to the government, but we never get a solution."

Senior paddy marketing officer A.V. Suresh Kumar said the procurement was hassle-free.As on Saturday, we have procured 428 loads of paddy. We have already reached an agreement with 43 mills for procurement. As of now, 18 mills have procured paddy from various places. Others will follow suit as the season progresses, Mr. Kumar said.Procurement from fields in Rani, Chithira, Veeyapuram and Venmani have been completed. The process is going on at Neelamperoor, Pulinkunnu, Ramankary and Edathua. Procurement is done as per the registration made by farmers online.Officials said that the area under paddy cultivation had fallen slightly compared to a year ago, when the crop was grown in 27,000 hectares. Delayed harvesting of the second crop season (additional crop season) owing to downpour in September-November months adversely affected the sowing of paddy during the puncha season. Besides, attack of wild rice (vari nellu) in polders last season forced some farmers to abandon cultivation. Farmers in some areas said that content of chaff in the crop was high.Price offeredThe procurement price offered this season is Rs. 23.30. This includes the Minimum Statutory Price of Rs. 15.50 and the State Incentive Bonus of Rs. 7.80. The farmers will get the procurement price from banks on production of the paddy receipt sheet (PRS) issued by the millers who procured the paddy. We had procured paddy worth Rs. 122 crore in the second crop season. Of the total amount, Rs. 108 crore has been disbursed to farmers. Rest of the amount will be distributed soon, Mr. Kumar added."

He said six agencies, including a government agency Kendriya Bhandar (KB), had submitted their quotations to the stores for the supply of textile materials. The stores sent the samples of KB to the National textile corporation limited laboratory at Coimbatore for testing.He said the test results revealed that barring the dhoti one, the other two material samples did not meet the technical specifications. KB submitted a complaint to the lieutenant governors office claiming that it had submitted test reports (of the sample) by central agencies in Hyderabad and its products were well within the technical specifications.Narayanasamy said the government decided to send KBs samples for testing again. We have sought the NTCL laboratory to test the KB samples again. The tendering process is under way. We have not finalised it. Technical bidding is in the process. We have not commenced financial bidding. At this junction, where does the question of corruption arise? Can she (lieutenant governor) prove any corrupt practices? She has been attempting to bring a bad name to the government and to tarnish the governments image, said Narayanasamy.Earlier, undeterred by the repeated charges that Raj Nivas has been blocking implementation of various projects of the government, Bedi said her office will continue to blow the whistle and halt corruption in the Union territory.Lieutenant governors office will continue to blow the whistle. To halt corruption anywhere once it gets to know. Or has credible evidence of it. It shall also continue to place facts in public domain as it believes people have a right to know. There is no shortcut to transparency and accountability, she said in a WhatsApp message (sic).In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Bedi brought to his notice that the chief minister and some of his cabinet colleagues have been persistently propagating the allegation that she continues to be a bottleneck in the implementation of welfare schemes. Their pronouncements are far from the truth, she said, furnishing complete information on the approvals accorded by her on the schemes submitted by the government.The government had sought her approval to supply rice free of cost to all ration card holders. However, Bedi sought the government to exclude the above poverty line families from the free scheme and approved the proposal. She said all files related to rice schemes were cleared  after recording observations  for implementation prudently and efficiently without wasting public money."

The move would eventually help the State achieve self-sufficiency in food production, he said.Mr. Vijayan was addressing a public function on Sunday after inaugurating the harvest on the 22-acre Thulichery paddy fields here, which had remained barren for over two decades after people moved away from farming citing low productivity and increasing cultivation cost.The initiative hopes to reap 20 quintals of rice from the peoples initiative, ably supported by the Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) and the Agriculture Department, involving the NREGP members under the close coordination of the CPI(M)-ruled Ajanur grama panchayat and the Kottachery Pattarakannirashi Devasthanam committee.The part of the rice produce would be used to serve around 3 lakh faithful who converge to witness the four day-long Vayanattukulavan theyyam festival here from May 3.Revenue Minister and local MLA E.

The sale of subsidised rice, wheat, flour and kerosene to beneficiaries were just on paper. A bulk of the PDS commodities ended in the open market.Officials said an estimated 80 lakh people draw sustenance from PDS. Studies conducted by the VACB in the past had indicated that only 40% of the PDS commodities reached intended beneficiaries.The VACB found that ration dealers rarely used standardised weighing scales.The short selling of PDS commodities, including sugar, was rampant. Dealers did not maintain daily sales register and investigators found discrepancies in stock.Director, VACB, Loknath Behera, ordered the raids."
