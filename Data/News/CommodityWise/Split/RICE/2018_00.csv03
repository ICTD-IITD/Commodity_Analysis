Statistics available with the State Planning Board show that Kerala lost over 5,00,000 hectares of paddy fields between 1980 and 2007. However, the initiatives taken by the government two years ago through its novel Harita Keralam programme to launch cultivation in all fallow land has started yielding results.Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunilkumar recently declared that the government would launch cultivation in 32,604 ha of paddy land that has remained fallow for a long time.Cultivation costUpper Kuttanad Nelkarshaka Samiti (UKNS) president Sam Eapen told The Hindu that small and medium farmers were overburdened with the cost of production as well as harvesting expenses. Rental charges for the combine harvester brought from Tamil Nadu is Rs. 1,700 an hour.Mr. Eapen said the government had fixed the handling charge for the harvested paddy at Rs. 12 for 100 kg way back in 2001-02. This meagre charge remains the same even today, in spite of the manifold increase in labour cost over the past 17 years.Though the wage structure in Kuttanad has been closely monitored and reviewed by the Kuttanad Industrial Regulatory Committee, absence of any such mechanism in the Upper Kuttanad has led to exorbitant claims of daily wages by farm workers, Mr. Eapen alleged.Many small-scale farmers who used to launch cultivation with money borrowed from local money lenders are very sceptical of the States support and promises. Mr. Eapen says the farmers in Upper Kuttanad have not received financial assistance of Rs. 4,500 for every hectare under theRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) for the past two years for reasons best known to the authorities concerned.Environmental issueThomas P. Thomas, environmentalist and Botany Professor at St. Thomas College, Kozhencherry, is of the view that the bulk density and water holding capacity of soil are more in paddy fields and less in bare lands. The major functions of wetlands and paddy fields are maintenance of fertility, productivity, recharge of groundwater, and purification. Wanton conversion of wetlands and paddy fields has been taking place in many parts of Central Travancore and Upper Kuttanad in the name of development. This should be brought to a halt and the government should take over all illegally converted land for agriculture purposes, Dr. Thomas said."

A godown in-charge was removed from service.Civil Supplies Commissioner C.V. Anand took a serious note of the development and initiated stringent action against millers involved in the incident. He ordered registering of criminal cases against two rice millers from Nagarkurnool district involved in the illegal sale of PDS rice and blacklisted the mills. Purchase of state pool rice from Nagarkurnool mills was suspended and the Commissioner asked the State Rice Millers Association to keep tab on its members."

The appointment of counsellors would help the students with learning disabilities. We will see if it is possible to appoint a counsellor for 10 schools.Another student said that when the government speaks of equality, the facilities provided to students of weaker sections should be extended to all. To this, Mr. Gowda said that persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes had been oppressed for 2,000 years, and it was only after independence that facilities were being extended to uplift them.To this day, people belonging to these communities remain segregated in rural areas, he said. Only some people from these communities have become officers, doctors and engineers. Hence, all governments work for their uplift. The Constitution too mandates that grants be reserved for their welfare, the Minister said."

Watching his fingers move deftly over the strings, listeners were enthralled with melody of the chaturangui slide guitar, an instrument he invented. Attributing the magic to his gurus and parents, he modestly remarks, It is all their blessings.We meet for a quick bite before Debashishs concert amidst the green environs of Triveni Terrace Caf. With a quick glance at the menu, he asks for aloo tikki and tea. Nothing like chai to make conversation, riyaz and performance enjoyable, he remarks.A geography graduate from the Calcutta University, Debashish chose an unusual instrument  slide guitar  to master and play Hindustani classical music. The genesis lies in the Hawaiian guitar my father presented me in 1966 when I was three. Plucking it, I was enamoured by its shape and sound, falling in love instantly, he says, sipping tea. The guitar is still with him. You cant ditch your first love, can you, he jests.Coming from a family steeped in musical tradition, Debashish must have been tempted to play other instruments. Yes, I have been attracted to several instruments. I like the melodious sound of sitar and sarod, veenas lower base sound, santoors staccato harmonic natural sound and sarangis pathos-filled soundscape. This enchantment made him learn sitar and sarod from Haradhan Roy Chowdhury and Gokul Nag, a well known sitar player. From them, I picked the technique of plucking with two fingers and manipulation of fingers to produce varied sounds.The vocal training under his mother, Manjushree Bhattacharya of Gwalior gharana and Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya trained in Patiala, helped Debashish hone his skills. He credits his parents for more. They laid the foundation of my life and music. My mother would sing even while cooking and my father would always be with the tanpura during his spare time. All this created a musical ambience at home. Being strict teachers, they wouldnt tolerate half-hearted attempts. On missing a note during practice, my mother hit me with the cooking spud. My father would encourage whenever there was a setback but ensured that awards never got to my head. He would make me rehearse a taan several hours till I got it perfect.Impressing the guruAll this was not in vain as it prepared him for a gruelling 10-year stay with Brij Bhushan Kabra, a slide-guitar pioneer. To be Kabrajis shishya was super tough. During those 10 years I gave no public performance. He did not allow me to write or record during the training sessions, ensuring that everything taught was committed to memory. Further, with him being busy, I could practice with him only from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Never satisfied, he would constantly goad me to do better.With praise and accolade coming rarely, Debashish tried harder and harder. All this made me adept at playing, mentally and emotionally strong. Since, his commendation was rare, I distinctly remember such occasions which were few and far. Once after practising throughout the night, he asked me to play raga Lalit early in the morning. Listening to it intently, he started crying. Waking up my Guru Ma, he asked her to fetch his purse. He fished out Rs. 100 and gave me saying Tune mera dil khush kar diya . That gift is absolutely invaluable.The gurus confidence in him was such that once in a packed auditorium, he asked Debashish to play. Unprepared, I was stumped. But when guru commands, you have to bleed for him. So I played raga Bhimplasi followed by Shree. He didnt say anything to me but told his friends how happy he was.Debashish feels varied arts came naturally to him because he never strained but enjoyed what he did. Believing in variety being essence of life, he was game to try everything which pleased him. Academics apart, he played cricket, badminton and football in school and college, learnt different instruments, watched movies and painted too. Never wanting to be slotted in a mould, I follow my hearts calling. So I painted for three days continuously till I finished the artwork; read voraciously missing my meals; watched four movies in a row; and practised guitar from dusk to dawn.Pointing at the tikki, he adds, The same holds true for my choice of food too. Never stuck on a particular cuisine, I like to taste local food and relish varied dishes  from pongal, idli and medu vada to dal bhatti churma, chingri malai curry and bhapa ilish. Unlike many, he is not averse to street food. How can anyone resist gol gappe, egg chicken roll, fish and chicken tikkas and jhal muri. I never miss eating on the roadside, bread toast with eggs and chai, he reveals with a twinkle in his eyes.So is he excessively fond of varied Indian cuisine? I wouldnt say that. As a musician, I like to listen to Hindustani and Carnatic music as well as Western music. Debashish has collaborated with John McLaughlin, Martin Simpson, Jerry Douglas and Jeff Sipe and several others. Likewise, I am fond of foreign cuisine too. I am partial to French sole with white sauce, Italian pasta with shrimps, cilantro and pesto, Spanish tapas, Mexican burrito and horchata and Chinese sea bass.Quick learningThe hot tikis are laid out on the table. The aroma is alluring. Tasting a slice with a touch of freshly made pudina chutney, Debashish nods his appreciation. The aroma is great and so is the blending of spices. It is neither hot nor bland but perfect in taste. Realising his liking for food, one wondered if he learnt cooking too. My first brush with cooking was in New York when being hungry and unable to find something I like, I called up my mother. Those days ISD charges were Rs. 90 per minute and in three minutes I noted the recipe for fish and egg curry. Rushing down to the 24x7 grocery shop I bought cod fish, coriander leaves, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, eggs, onion, potato, aubergine, and mustard oil. I made rice and egg curry and my friend on return was intrigued by the aroma. We enjoyed each and every bit of that meal. So did this passion continue? Yes, I kept learning from my mother and later my wife. For me, my taste buds are my teacher in cooking just like my aural senses are in creating music. I keep experimenting with food and can make delicious sea bass, a mix of dal and vegetables and sauteed fish and vegetables.Debashishs desire to innovate is not limited to food alone. He is credited with invention of three instruments. Called the Trinity of Guitars these are 24-string Chaturangui, 14-string Gandharvi and four-string Anandi. I was haunted by sounds of sarod, sitar, santoor, veena and vocal rendition of greats like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Vishnu Digambar Paluskar among others. Trying to replicate them on my 16-string slide guitar was not satisfactory. So, I created these three instruments with special wood and string, sound board and by adjusting the height of the bridge and nut.With a life-long commitment to popularise slide-guitar, Debashish has gone beyond inventing. He has established the Universal School of Music in Kolkata, set up a recording company and guitar workshop for research in slide guitars. I have done this with a vision to ensure continuity of slide-guitar.The School teaches a 16-part syllabus designed by him for five years. When I started learning, there was no reference point for me in the sense there were no slide-guitar recordings or performances to guide me. This syllabus helps in overcoming this obstacle, while the recording company and workshop provides avenues for those who want to do pioneering work in the field. His efforts are not limited to training youngsters in Hindustani music alone. I want my students to evolve and develop their own styles in Hindustani, Carnatic, Jazz, Blues and other genres. Being blessed with fine training and upbringing, I want to pass on the legacy.For me, my taste buds are my teacher in cooking just like my aural senses are in creating music"
5b144eab9855b7624637ee5d,Aadhaar  smart cards yet to dent PDS drawal,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aadhaar-smart-cards-yet-to-dent-pds-drawal/article23248670.ece,2018-03-15,"The attempt to regulate the quantum of rice drawn by beneficiaries of the Public Distribution System (PDS) has not met with much success. Neither Aadhaar seeding of ration cards nor the introduction of smart cards, which were supposed to remedy this situation, helped.In February 2017, the quantity of rice offtake was little less than 3.23 lakh tonnes. A year later, it came down by 6,000 tonnes to around 3.17 lakh tonnes.Between April 2017 and February 2018, the quantity of rice drawn was about 35 lakh tonnes, barely 1.75 lakh tonnes short of the annual allotment assured to Tamil Nadu under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Every month, the State requires around 3.2 lakh tonnes.Steep rise checkedIn 2016 and 2017, the Aadhaar seeding and the distribution of smart cards were carried out vigorously.Out of 6.6 crore Aadhaar allottees in the State, 6.3 crore have been covered.Out of the 1,94,58,897 conventional cards in vogue in the State, smart cards were given to all but 34,975 persons.A senior official of the department is, however, quick to point out that with the net increase of four lakh cards in the last one year and enhanced entitlements being provided to the beneficiaries over and above what has been prescribed by the NFSA, the drawal of rice would have been much higher than the present level but for the measures taken by the department.Also, if one were to consider the figures of drawal by the PDS beneficiaries in December 2017 and February 2018, the reduction is quite perceptible at around 13,000 tonnes.It is only since February that we started insisting on the production of smart cards at the time of getting the provisions from fair price shops. We hope to see a further fall in the rice drawal in the coming months, the official says.Fingerprint dataAnother measure being planned by the department is to collect fingerprint data from the beneficiaries.It will take about four months to install machines at the fair price shops. The department hopes that after the implementation of this step, the fall in the rice drawal will be steeper.The government is keen on bringing down the quantum of drawal given the Rs. 1,000 crore annual expenditure it incurs in meeting the gap between the requirement and the allotment.On an average, 25,000 tonnes are purchased every month over and above the NFSA allotment."

Chandrasekharan and Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar and a stop memo issued by the village officer concerned.Political dimensionThe issue has a political dimension with local MLA V.T. Balram accusing the CPI(M) leadership of using Chef Minister Pinarayi Vijayans office to prevent the Palakkad district administration from acting against the violator.The Agriculture Minister had on March 12 directed the Palakkad District Collector to inspect the site and initiate action against the person who had illegally reclaimed the land. The written direction also had carried an instruction to facilitate registering of a police FIR against the plant owner. But nothing has happened so far, alleges the MLA. According to him, the plant owner with large business interests was very close to certain CPI(M) leaders in the region.Located hardly 100 metres from the Koottanad-Mezhathoor road, the three acres form part of a vast expanse of rice fields.The local community alleged that the plant was permitted by the authorities without even the mandatory clearance of the Pollution Control Board. It may all likely cause large-scale air pollution and people might suffer respiratory problems, says Vineeth Rajan, a local activist.According to Balram, Palakkad Collector P. Suresh Babu had not visited the spot so far ignoring the findings of the village officer and the directives of the Revenue and Agriculture Ministers. Kodanad village officer K.C. Krishnakumar has given a detailed report to Sub Collector in Ottappalam confirming violation of the 2008 act by the plant.However, the District Collector chose to turn down requests of representatives of local action committee against the plant who visited him in Pattambi last week seeking a spot verification. He even advised the representatives to take a favourable stand to the plant as asphalt remains a key component of road construction, alleged Mr Balram.Though the plant owner had approached Kerala High Court twice seeking to vacate the stop memo issued by the village officer, the court had refused to entertain it. The plant owner claimed it was not paddy field but dry land. On completion, the asphalt plant would manufacture asphalt, macadam and other forms of coated roadstone, collectively known as blacktop."

Rohit Gupta, MD of Sarveshwar Foods, believes that while a company from J&K will enter the listed space after two decades, the development has already set the ball rolling for others from the State to initiate the process of listing.There are good entrepreneurs in the State, but they have little awareness about the stock market, said Mr. Gupta. But since we completed our IPO successfully, they are now asking us what is the process for listing and its benefits, he added.Uday Patil, director investment banking, Keynote Corporate Services, which is one of the merchant bankers for the issue, said: An IPO of a company from Jammu & Kashmir opens up opportunities for many other established companies from the State to explore opportunities to raise equity and get into the listed space, he said.The company, which once supplied basmati rice to the royal family of J&K, was started in 1890 and since then has diversified into nearly 40 products.The listing of a company from Jammu & Kashmir is an important milestone for NSE Emerge platform... the focus is to create value for companies, which is also the reason that over 50% of our listed SMEs are from manufacturing sector, with services sector too having sizeable representation, said Varanasi, Chief Business Development Officer, NSE."
5b1456569855b75db2e6b3e8,Ryots begin to favour pulses over paddy in State’s rice bowl,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ryots-begin-to-favour-pulses-over-paddy-in-states-rice-bowl/article23297970.ece,2018-03-20,"Lured by the prospect of additional income with little effort, more farmers in Thanjavur district have taken to cultivation of pulses. Consequently, the area under the crop, mostly black gram, has shot up by a phenomenal 10,000 hectare (ha) this year.In Thanjavur district, the normal area under pulses is roughly 25,000 hectare. While in the kharif season (July to October) an estimated 9,200 hectare is brought under pulses, another 15,800 ha is covered with pulses during the rabi months (October to March).This kharif season, the area under pulses was estimated to be 13,323 ha and shot up to 21,871 ha during rabi, bringing a total of 35,194 ha under pulses. This is bound to go up by another 300 ha, as sugarcane growers will plant it as an inter-crop in their fields in the next couple of weeks.The sharp increase of around 10,194 ha under pulses is attributed to two principal factors. The first is the special campaign run by the Department of Agriculture that encouraged farmers to go in for profitable black gram varieties during the kharif season, wherever paddy cultivation could not be taken up due to irrigation restrictions for want of adequate water supply. The second important factor was that the officials encouraged bund cropping on paddy fields and inter-cropping of pulses on sugarcane fields wherever possible, say sources in the Department.The bolster came from Thanjavur, Budalur, Tiruvaiyaru, Orathanad, Pattukkottai, Peravurani and Sethubavachatram blocks that reported increased area overage. Varieties such as ADT 5, Vamban 5 and Vamban 6 are popular among the farmers.Continued water scarcity that prevented us from raising kuruvai for six years on the trot and the failure of the samba during 2015-16 led us to think of viable alternatives without forcing us to lose sight of the traditional paddy cultivation methods. Here, cultivation of pulses as border crop and inter crop came in handy and now farmers have realised the benefits of raising pulses varieties and that explains their growing popularity, said A. Rasappa Udayar of Thirumalai Samudram, a farmer who raised black gram as the major crop.Last samba season, we feared that the long duration paddy crop might get hit and so opted for medium duration crops. That facilitated raising of green gram and black gram either as rice fallow pulses or as border crop. Luckily, the additional revenue from pulses made good to some extent the shortfall in returns from paddy whose prices fell sharply, said another farmer T. Vedamurthy Rajapiriyar of Soorakkottai near Thanjavur.There has been a steady increase in the area under pulses in Thanjavur district in the past four years. During 2014-15, pulses were raised on 23,441 ha, while in 2015-16 the coverage went up to 24,959 ha. In 2016-17, the area further enlarged to 25,848 ha. This year, the officials hope to touch 36,000 hectare."

The government announced in the Council on Thursday that it plans to erect temporary check dams in areas like Uran and Panvel, and a request to this effect will be sent to the Centre.Cabinet Minister Diwakar Raote said thousands of acres of farm land are being destroyed by tidal waves. The minister also said that low quality check dams were constructed by contractors at the district and taluka level, which led to sea water seeping in and affecting the farm productivity.In Uran and Panvel, rice farming was destroyed in taluks of Kelvane, Punade and Vasheni because the protection dams could not stop the water. Most of this land became barren while many farmers went bankrupt, Mr. Raote said.We have conducted a probe and found officials and contractors guilty. While action was taken against them, compensation has been awarded to the farmers, he said.The question was raised by legislators Balram Patil, Pravin Darekar, Girish Vyas, Sanjay Dutt, Sharad Ranpise, all of whom demanded to know what the government is doing to protect farm land along the coastline."

Moreover, 90% of the business was managed by women, he added.Commercial potentialThe climate of the hill district was quite similar to Sikkim, but the commercial potential of orchid farming was yet to be tapped here, he said.A show depicting live plants, photographs, and paintings for creating awareness about the importance of genetic (morphological) diversity of orchids would be a major attraction.Different orchid species and hybrids will be exhibited in around 200 stalls, besides those that are botanically, medicinally, and economically significant."

The Budget, with heavy financial and revenue deficit and huge debts, has actually heralded a warning signal, said Mr. Stalin, who, along with his party MLAs, turned up at the Assembly wearing a black shirt.The DMK and Congress staged a walkout of the House as soon as Mr. Panneerselvam began presenting the Budget.Later, they returned to the Assembly.Alleging that there were no constructive announcements to ameliorate the living conditions of the fishermen, farmers and weavers, Mr. Stalin said the construction of a memorial for Jayalalithaa alone seemed to be the highlight of the Budget."

Just 123 vendors secured space. One of them was Iranian Abdel Ali Said, who has bought and sold truffles since the 1960s.They come from Iran, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and beyond, he said of his truffle selection.Prices range from seven to 20 Kuwaiti dinars (Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 4,300) per kg depending on the quality."

Srivastava, chief policy adviser at EY India said.Now, the level of export and import growth has moved down, reflecting the change in the global economy towards more protectionist measures. The other factor could be that sometimes when global crude prices fall, then the demand for Indian exports also falls.Export growth slowed to 4.48% in February compared with 9.07% growth in January. A government release said that in February, major commodity groups of export showing positive growth over a year earlier were petroleum products (27.44%), organic & inorganic chemicals (30.41%), drugs & pharmaceuticals (13.92%), rice (21.29%), and electronic goods (29.71%).On imports, it added that major commodity groups of import showing high growth are petroleum, crude & products (32.05%), electronic goods (18.95%), machinery, electrical & non-electrical (23.04%), pearls, precious & semi-precious stones (15.86%), and coal, coke & briquettes, etc. (17.73%).(With inputs from TCA Sharad Raghavan)"

They have become part of the village ecosystem, so much so that they present themselves outside homes, to peck on rice and millets that the residents offer.Peacocks are often seen in the fields and are wary of human presence in their proximity. However, here in Elasappalli, the two peacocks have become a part of the village, coexisting with its humans and animals alike.As if on cue, these peacocks once a while regale the locals by springing open their patterned blue-green plumage rendering a visual delight that people elsewhere yearn for a glimpse.We dont know where they came from.

After a mouthful of gruel, she picks up a piece of pakodi, which she kept in the cans lid by her side, for munching. She doesnt remember her age, but she appears to be around 70 years.She identifies herself as Yaamala Kaluvamma. The woman has been guarding the uprooted trees that she raised on her 1.3 acre of D-patta land. The State government in 1976 allotted the wasteland to her husband, Yaamala Chinna Lakshmaiah. They cleared bushes, removed boulders, and made it arable. They raised 50 mango trees, 30 teak trees, and 20 cashew plantations on the land. After the death of her husband over a decade ago, the pattadar passbook that her husband kept with him was lost. It was not traced so far. But, Kaluvamma has been reaping the benefit since then. She is eking out a living unperturbed.The decision of Revenue officials to acquire the land to make way for a by-pass road o Vizianagaram from Chelluru to Gotlam in Bondapalli mandal came as a blow to her. Interestingly, according to Revenue records, the piece of land was poramboke. The officials reportedly made no changes in the records after allotting the same to Chinna Lakshmaiah in 1976.A shocked Garuvamma launched a relay fast on her piece of land itself and continued it till her protest attracted officials. Finally, Revenue officials conceded her demand. They paid Rs. 35,000 as compensation for the trees and assured to provide her land elsewhere. She called off her protest on the eve of Christmas. But, she guards the dried trees and waits for someone to buy the uprooted trees. Already, some miscreants had taken away a portion of the dried trees, she complained."

S. Siva Sathya from Puducherry also won an award.Dr. Iyer, who lost her hands in a freak bomb explosion in Bikaner and sustained multiple fractures on her legs and had nerve paralysis, is now part of the United Nations Inter Agency Network on Youth and Gender Equality. Through sheer grit and determination, she became an international motivational speaker and a disability rights activist. She is also a model.For Ms. Balaji, chairperson and managing trustee of the NGO, AIM For Seva, preserving old varieties of rice is a passion. She not only grew these lost gems but also made sure that people could taste them and encouraged farmers to grow them once again. She started with just four varieties of rice and within four years, has preserved nearly 30 varieties. She also started a store, Spirit of the Earth, in Chennai that stocks these varieties of rice.Kase founders Ms. Krishnamoorthy and Ms. Sundaresan have been honoured for their work among women with disabilities. The enterprise produces 20 varieties of unique artisanal cheese that is made by the women with disabilities. The cheese is made from the milk of grass-fed cows with no preservatives or chemicals of any kind.What was a barren six-acre piece of eroded land, is now a vibrant forest with waterbodies, a fruit tree area and a garden. This has been possible due to the hard work of conservationist Deepika Kundaji, who created the soil for this barren land by recycling vegetation. Aptly named Pebble Garden, it is now integral to the area as it has helped revive wildlife and uplift the local ecosystem.App for womenMs. Siva Sathyas mobile app, MITRA (Mobile Initiated Tracking & Rescue Application), is being used by the Puducherry police since 2016.The app helps women send alerts to the police and friends in case of an emergency."

The workers urged the Collector to credit their wages through post offices as bankers were not giving money deposited in their accounts citing a cash crunch.The DWMA assistant project director Nageswara Rao told the Collector that steps were being taken to deposit the wages by asking workers to open post office accounts. He said physically-challenged workers were being paid Rs. 333 per day, double the wage of Rs. 165 for normal workers.Funds were sanctioned to arrange sheds and provide drinking water to NREGS workers, the Collector said. He enquired with workers about subsidised rice supply.Water scarcityHe later inspected NREGS works in Veldurthi. When workers complained of water supply once in eight days, the Collector told the Rural Water Supply superintending engineer over mobile phone to make alternative arrangements to supply water. He wanted water transported by tankers in villages facing scarcity.He told DWMA officials to supply butter milk sachets to NREGS workers from April. The district had 16 lakh NREGS workers but the turnout of workers was less, the Collector said and wanted more work provided to them. He inspected a waste recycling unit. DWMA assistant project officers, Kodumur and Veldurthi tahsildars and MPDOs were present."

Sasikalas niece J. Krishnapriya, who grew up in Veda Nilayam in Poes Garden and lived there until her marriage in 2000.Sources privy to Ms. Krishnapriyas deposition made on January 2 before the Justice Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry, where she was summoned, said she claimed that Sasikala had thought of taking Jayalalithaa abroad for better treatment sometime in October 2016 when she was in Apollo Hospitals. But the proposal was turned down by Jayalalithaa.On September 23, 2016, at the hospital, her mother Ilavarasi reportedly told her that Jayalalithaa had gained consciousness in the morning and wanted to know where she was.On being told that she was in a hospital, the then Chief Minister smiled and remarked to a doctor that they would not have been able to bring her to the hospital had she been conscious at the time of shifting.Visitor to ICUStating that no one, except Sasikala, was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit, Ms. Krishnapriya said she, her mother and her aunt stayed together on the third floor of the hospital and Sasikala alone used to go to the ICU whenever she was called for.While in hospital, Jayalalithaa ate idlis, pongal and tomato rice in small quantities and even had ice cream.She likes fruits Once she ate grapes and began coughing, Ms. Krishnapriya had told the Commission. [Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan had last year apologised publicly claiming he and others had lied that Jayalalithaa ate idli in hospital.]According to her, on December 4, 2016, a day before she died, doctors said that Jayalalithaas brain was functional but the heart could not be resuscitated despite putting her on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). When I reached the hospital, a surgery was underway by cutting open her chest right in the ward. Thereafter, the procedure was continued after shifting her to an operation theatre, she added.Medical miracleShe claimed that her aunt Sasikala expected a medical miracle to happen anytime. Therefore, she asked the doctors to continue to keep Jayalalithaa on life support and provide treatment as usual.The deponent had told the Commission that she was not aware whether Jayalalithaas brain was functional when the life support was withdrawn on December 5, 2016.ECMO was discontinued beyond the evening hours of December 5, 2016. One of her saris was brought from home and it was draped around the body before we took it home. The body was then laid in the drawing room of the house and rituals were performed with the assistance of a priest Around seven women assisted in the process, her statement read.No one except Sasikala was allowed to meet Jayalalithaa when she was in the Intensive Care Unit"

5b1475a69855b7624638008f,Farming in Tamil Nadu ready for a turnaround,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farming-in-tamil-nadu-ready-for-a-turnaround/article23345688.ece,2018-03-25,"Nearly six years ago, R. Muthukumar, who studied at the National Institute of Fashion Technology, Chennai, returned to his village, Karungalikuppam, about 20 km from Tiruvannamalai town, after working in a couple of metro cities, including Bengaluru.Now a farmer owning around 4.8 acres of dry land, Mr. Muthukumar, who is in his mid-30s, has seen changes happening in the way agriculture is practised in his village and surrounding areas. For instance, the level at which groundwater can be spotted is going deeper and deeper, an outcome largely due to the policy of free power supply for farmers, he says. In the beginning, I could get water at about 10 m. Now, we have to go down at least 23 m, he says.But that is not the only change Mr. Muthukumar has observed. At one point of time, I did not have anyone here to discuss the system of rice intensification (SRI), a method of cultivation involving less use of water, seeds and input. My people did not relish the idea as they were used to flood irrigation. But they no longer remain so, he says, adding that he has found many progressive farmers in nearby villages experimenting with innovative methods.Karungalikuppam is not a solitary example. Enjampalli, a tiny village near Modakurichi in Erode district, is no less different. Other than paddy, maize and cotton are being grown increasingly. Drip irrigation is gaining greater currency these days.Subtle shifts have started happening in the farm sector in Tamil Nadu and the farmers, by and large, are alive to the trends and emerging constraints, and are ready to adapt. While innovative policy interventions can be thought of to support them and fix smaller problems without causing too much disruption, the elephant in the room that needs immediate attention is the dismal groundwater situation.Open to ideasI can see more educated youngsters coming into this sector and taking up farming with the help of modern technology, says R. Subramanian, a 54-year-old farmer with an experience of over 30 years, dispelling the notion that present-day agriculture is full of senior citizens.As late as about 10 years ago, farmers of Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts, despite being in dry areas, were not receptive to drip irrigation even when the State government had decided to implement a scheme, recounts E. Vadivel, former Dean of the Horticulture Department in the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). Now, the same method is used even for water-intensive crops such as sugarcane.For years, N. Doraisamy, a soldier-turned-farmer, kept as wasteland an area of about three acres in Ananthapuram Mathura, Padavedu block, Tiruvannamalai district. Thanks to a government subsidy scheme for micro-irrigation, coupled with assistance from the Srinivasan Services Trust (SST), the land is fully covered with drip irrigation now.I am raising mango, sapota plum and gooseberry. I hope to get Rs. 1.5 lakh, says Mr. Doraisamy, adding that but for the new facility, he would have raised such crops only during September-January and earned a few thousands of rupees. The work in Padavedu is one of a number of projects being carried out by the SST, a 22-year-old body engaged in a host of initiatives concerning rural communities and urban slums in five States.Dry lands in 25 districts have now become the target of the State Agriculture Department for a Rs. 803 crore programme of sustainable agriculture. Though it is too early to assess the impact of the scheme which was launched a year ago, the department claims that the area of cultivation for millets went up by 22% and for pulses, 18%.Significantly, this initiative enables farmers buy farm implements such as tractors and rotovators, which, in turn, can be given on rent to other farmers at cheaper rates. A government subsidy covers 80% of the cost of the machines. In Karungalikuppam of Tiruvannamalai district, a group of young farmers, instead of taking loans to meet the remaining cost of the implements, pooled their savings to acquire them.Crop diversificationCrop diversification is also catching on. During kuruvai [short-term cultivation season], even in the Cauvery delta, do you think we are all raising paddy? It is cotton, quips P. R. Pandian, a Mannargudi-based leader of agriculturists. The coverage of cotton in the delta during 2016-17 was 17 lakh acres. This year, the plan is to extend it to 21 lakh acres, notes K. Ramasamy, TNAU Vice-Chancellor.Rainfed areas, also known as dry lands, too do not appear to be lagging. In the southern districts, the belt between Srivilliputhur and Tirunelveli, where paddy was ordinarily raised during the Samba cultivation season (September-January), of late has seen maize being grown. A report by the Department of Land Resources in the Union Rural Development Ministry a few years ago commended the State, stating that the adoption of new oilseed crops, especially soyabean and sunflower in Tamil Nadu, is [a] testimony to the potential for rapid changes in rainfed areas.Meanwhile, the State is in the midst of another experiment  collective farming  which is in its early days. The concept, not altogether new to Tamil Nadu, is the new mantra of the State government. Its idea is to organise marginal and small farmers, who constitute 92% of the whole community of agriculturists, into groups and, eventually, bigger organisations or even companies. This year, Rs. 100 crore was set apart for the scheme.On productivity too, the States performance is better than the national average and that of other States. According to the findings of a 2017 study of the PRS Legislative Research on agriculture, Tamil Nadu (3,191 kg per hectare) comes next only to Punjab (3,838 kg/ha) at the all-India level in terms of yield for rice for 2014-15, even though its record is not that impressive with regard to yield for food grains [which includes pulses and millets too] as a whole.Chronic problemsWhile these are the positives, chronic problems plague agriculture, including labour shortage, dependence on private lenders, absence of fair and remunerative prices for produce, and hurdles in marketing. However, the foremost is the lack of efficiency in water use. In times of crisis, farmers behave in an exemplary manner. But, once the situation improves, it is all back to business as usual. Such an attitude cannot continue for long, feels Dr. Vadivel.The way groundwater resources are being depleted in the State has disturbed M.P. Vasimalai, an alumnus of theIndian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. In his native village of Ezhumalai near Usilampatti in Madurai district, we are not able to raise one crop today whereas we once did three crops a year. It is because of indiscriminate use of groundwater, thanks to energised pumpsets. There are about 20.6 lakh such pumpsets all over the State.His anecdotal account is supported by a number of studies by both official and independent bodies, all pointing to the situation that is, in his words, leading to a catastrophe. Mr. Vasimalai, the founder-executive director of the DHAN Foundation, says desertification is happening across the State, and, despite the creation of farm ponds, percolation ponds and other water harvesting structures under schemes including the latest one on dry land farming, more steps are needed.Flood irrigation should be banned in areas where water is being pumped. Only drip irrigation should be allowed. Then, you can reduce water consumption by least 25%, Dr. Ramasamy says, expressing concern over the increasing occurrence of salinity intrusion in groundwater.Groundwater lawThere is no sight of the government coming out with a law again to regulate groundwater extraction, even though over four years have lapsed since the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa chose to repeal the 2003 Act, the creation of her previous regime. The assurance given to the public at the time of withdrawal was that soon there would be a comprehensive and workable law. One of the principal objections to the old law was the lack of clarity on the definition of marginal and small farmers.The farmer from Enjampalli in Erode is not averse to fixing tariff for farm connections, a subject regarded in political circles as a hot potato. A reasonable rate for the power supply can be levied, suggests Mr. Subramanian, adding that this will also pave the way for efficient use of groundwater.Deepa Kumar, who is running a network of young farmers to promote organic farming near Denhanikotta of Krishnagiri district, has a radical idea. Even for agriculture, you can take electricity connection under commercial tariff and still make your farming profitable, as there is enormous scope for using water judiciously through natural or organic farming, says the farmer in her late 30s, adding that members of her network have given up their jobs in the IT sector to pursue farming.Contrary to the position of the officials in Chennai, the governments latest scheme on dry land agriculture does cover farmers who have taken electricity connections for pump sets, as noticed by this reporter in Villupuram, Tiruvannamalai and Krishnagiri districts.Tweaking policyThe government is promoting collective farming to counter the effects of fragmentation of land holdings. Mr. Pandian says that while he is not against it per se, the farmers, after getting organised into FPGs or FPOs, should not be left at the mercy of the corporate sector for price negotiations on commercial transactions.They cannot match the power and resources of large corporate groups. So, the government should perform its role as an effective regulator, he says.Another aspect that the government should keep in mind is that procedures for setting up value addition facilities, such as processing mills for pulses, should be made simple. In Radhapuram near Thandirampattu of Tiruvannamalai district, it took two years for farmers to get approvals from various departments to set up one such mill and, after three months of commissioning the facility, they are still struggling for a three-phase power supply.There are also larger issues that affect the farmers. A substantial section of farmers is not ready to take to alternative crops, notwithstanding various measures to attract their attention. Left to any farmer, paddy is still the first choice. During 2016-17, cotton was raised in a big way but prices crashed, and the farmer had no system of minimum support price for support.There is a general complaint in Villupuram and Krishnagiri about unilateral actions of secretaries of Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies (PACCS) in disbursing of crop loans.This is one of the reasons for farmers approaching private lenders. A senior official at the office of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies acknowledges the prevalence of the problem and says that as of now, there is no provision to get erring secretaries of PACCS transferred. The government is working on this issue.Road aheadWith all the problems and issues plaguing the sector, the young Muthkumars and Deepa Kumars are yet confident of making a difference through cohesive networks, deployment of latest technologies and the acquisition of knowledge. After all, it is their firm belief that without modernisation of agriculture, food security cannot be guaranteed in a sustained way.We are not able to raise one crop today whereas we once did three crops a yearM.P.

Since he was repeatedly involved in smuggling rice, he was detained under the Act.Three arrestedThe Thudiyalur Police have arrested Selvam (23) of Udayampalayam, Bharani Maharajeswaran (26) of Vellalore and Balachandar (22) of Kavundampalayam on charges of attempting to extort Rs. 10 lakh from a realtor. According to the police, three persons forced their way into 60-year-old Harpreet Singhs car on March 9, pointed a gun at him and demanded Rs. 10 lakh.Mr. Singh pulled down his car window and shouted for help. A constable on traffic duty rushed to help. On seeing the policeman moving towards them, the three fled the scene leaving the gun behind. On inspection, it turned out to be a toy gun.Based on a complaint, the police registered a case. During the course of inquiry, Mr. Singh had told them that a few days ago, one of the three persons who entered the car, went to his house claiming to be a policeman sent by Thudiyalur Police to provide security cover as he was into real estate business. Suspecting his identity and statement, Mr. Singh told the police that he had sent away the man.Based on the information Mr. Singh gave and images captured by CCTV cameras near the crime spot, the police said that they began investigation and arrested the three persons - Selvam, Bharani and Balachandar.Selvam, a diploma holder, worked in a private bank, Bharani worked as a driver and Balachandar in a private college.Businessman assaultedThree persons on Thursday assaulted businessman Krishnan (54) of Maniakarampalayam in Goldwyns, said the Peelamedu Police.

They also carry a jhola (sling bag) containing rice mixed with turmeric (thalambralu). Later, the devotees watch the celestial wedding of Rama and Sita and ring the bell of their tridents after reciting slokas after the priests. After the celestial wedding, they sprinkle thalambralu and declare the marriage ritual with Lord Shiva completed and apply kumkum on other devotees.Jangama priest Rajender said the marriage of devotees to Lord Shiva is an age-old practice followed only at Vemulawada temple. We do not perform any marriage ritual, but only rudraksha or lingam dharana (thread) around the neck of the devotees by reciting some vedic hymns. It is only the devotees who declare themselves as married to God, he stated. After the ritual in fulfilment of their vow the devotees return home to their families."

Devotees going up the hill on foot were seen feeding wild animals at deer park though it is banned as per law. The forest department has put up boards warning of punitive action if the norms are violated but never implemented the same.According to the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972 Section 38J, disturbing animals by any means, including teasing, hurting and attempting to feed, is liable to a fine of up to Rs 25,000 and a jail term of up to 7 years. The forest wing of Tirumala Tirupati Devastanam (TTD) has put up the boards saying the same on the pedestrian pathway up the hill.Forest officials have washed their hands of the problem by only putting up the boards. Enforcement of the act was abysmally low as not even a single case was registered in this regard, according to wild life enthusiasts. Ratnakar from Tirupati, who has been doing research in wildlife, observed that forest officials were not bothered to deploy a person to stop devotees from feeding the animals.The deer park used to have nearly 400 spotted deer about five years ago, but the number has come down to around 100 now. Many of the animals have died because of deceases they contracted from consumption of external food fed by the devotees, said Ratnakar. Apart from deer, the forest also has many types of birds, grey langurs and monkeys.Unaware of the consequences and just for the sake of fun, devotees used to throw food items like tamarind rice, chips, kurkure and other confectioneries at the animals. Some of them do it just for fun and for taking selfies.Dr Goutam, a veterinary doctor, said that feeding the ruminants with processed food like chips, kurkure, confectioneries and rice was not at all advisable. He said the digestive system of the animals was not accustomed to these kinds of food and they could end up losing their lives if they developed acid indigestion condition. Though it is not life threatening, feeding fruits to animals was not advisable as the animals, over a period, develop a tendency to wait for someone to feed them fruits instead of searching for food themselves, he said."

The Congress government, which waived Rs. 8,000 crore of farm loans, had spent three times more than the previous BJP government in Karnataka on providing irrigation. The Siddaramaiah government has filled over 2 lakh lakes and provided interest-free loans up to Rs. 3 lakh to thousands of farmers, he said.While the previous BJP government misused public money through corrupt practices, the Congress government had provided rice to the poor under Anna Bhagya, milk under Ksheera Bhagya, free cycles to five lakh students, and books to 61 lakh students.

A Saora painting is seen in the background. The art was born in the remote ranges of southern Odisha.Biswaranjan RoutSaora paintings, lately sought by art lovers for living rooms around the world, have their origin in the mud walls of aboriginal Lanjia Saora tribal homes in Odisha. Selling fast at tribal art fairs and handicraft outlets, painting lots are also exported regularly to Germany, France and the U.S. The paintings, which are pleasing to the eye and widely admired for their artistic excellence, now offer a sustainable source of livelihood.It is a remarkable transformation for the sacred art of a little-known community. Also called the hill Saoras, the community inhabits the remote ranges flanking the great Bansadhara river in southern Odisha.Talented artists from the community have clearly benefited from training and design interventions. People waste no time in buying our paintings as soon as they are completed. Foreigners are showing special interest in our paintings, says Sanjay Gamang, a 22-year-old Saora artist.Idital and iditalmar sA Saora painting is called Idital and the person who creates it is known as the iditalmar . Interesting anecdotes are associated with their art practice. Iditals are sketched to appease Saora ancestors and deities that may have caused diseases faced by the iditalmar s or the villagers at large. In Saora society, a shaman is believed to be an intermediary between the worlds of the living and the dead. The iditalmar draws to instructions from the shaman .An Iditalmar follows stringent sacred rituals by eating one meal a day for 10-15 days till the painting is completed. Before the painting is made, the wall is cleaned and smeared with locally available red soil, then rice paste is prepared as white colour for painting with bamboo sticks [instead of brushes], says Purusottam Patnaik, researcher with the State-run Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI), Bhubaneswar.Each painting has a rectangular frame, and features icons of deities, or those drawn from nature. Its said that there are 64 artistic motifs that are drawn by the iditalmar s in a painting. Some frequently featured motifs include Labasum (the earth god), Jodisum (the village deity), Manduasum (the sun god) and Jananglosum (the wind deity). Distinct paintings are drawn with different occasions between birth and death in mind.SCSRTI director A. B. Ota believes tribal cultures can be preserved if they are seen as livelihood options. He encouraged some changes that made Saora paintings easy to market.Skills honedWe sent Saora youth to professional institutes like the B. K. School of Arts, where they honed their skill further, and the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) where they received inputs for modernising. Little changes were introduced, such as painting in different sizes and using acrylic colours for longevity, said Dr. Ota. Saora paintings have also been embossed on tea cups and document folders.While some changes were made to the paintings, we kept their essence intact and never interfered with their sacred beliefs, he added.The agrarian Saoras have lived a quiet life in the lap of nature for centuries. The tribe finds mention in the Hindu epic Ramayana with Savari, Lord Rams devotee.Hardly any iditalmar remains unemployed. The artists are also hired by civic authorities to paint and beautify city walls. It takes a day to complete a 20x8 inch painting priced upwards of Rs. 700; the materials required to make it cost Rs. 100.

Some time last year, the rain failed completely in his region, and he was forced to look for work elsewhere.A man in the area offered him, and others suffering from similar agrarian distress, a job in Bengaluru. The lure came in the form of a loan of Rs. 20,000. I came here in November thinking I would work till the end of the summer... But, some time in February, I didnt even think I would survive till then, he says.Krushna is among 43 labourers and children rescued from a brick kiln in Bagalur on Thursday, where they were trafficked to work as bonded labourers. The group would work nearly 16 hours a day.The children would flip over bricks during the baking process. If every couple achieved 6,000 bricks by the end of the week, they would be given Rs. 300 each  or, one-sixth of the mandated daily-wage rate in the State. Children were made to flip the bricks in the baking oven. I thought if I work, I can send some money to my wife and two children (who are in his native village). I havent been able to save a single rupee, says Krushna.If distress in Odisha has seen labourers being forced into feudal servitude each year, the brick kilns on the outskirts of the city  catering to the burgeoning demand from the real estate sector  continue to see exploitation of cheap labour. According to the group, which left for Odisha on Saturday morning, their relatives and neighbours are spread across at least 12 kilns in the region  all of them working in similar conditions.International Justice Mission, which assisted the district administration and the local police in the rescue, said more than half of the bonded labourers rescued are from Odisha, and in particular Bolangir district. Of the 1,141 persons rescued, 623 were from Odisha; while in 2017, 155 of 273 workers were from Odisha.Among those rescued was 20-year-old Mithali, who is six months pregnant. While her husband and brother-in-law pleaded with the owner to let her go back to their hometown, she said he would give her a tablet and force her to continue. It was very hard work. Even if I felt sick and would be vomiting, I would be forced to make bricks, she said.But, for the rescued persons, there is fear of going back home. The traffickers and their networks continue to remain strong in their home district. Some narrate stories of their relatives, who had fled brick kilns, being threatened and assaulted. They were either forced to go back to bonded labour or pay up the loan amount.Where do we go now? What protection will we get from the traffickers that brought us here? said a diminutive woman in the group.No compensationWhile the 2017 Central Government Scheme, which enhances the on-the-spot compensation to Rs. 20,000 for those rescued, none of the rescued in this case or previous cases in Bengaluru have received the money.We have written to the Centre for clarity on how to give the money, under which head (of accounts) should it be taken, and whether it should be given in cash or cheque, said M.K. Jagadeesh, Assistant Commissioner of Bengaluru Urban. But, the compensation amount can be claimed from their home districts and we will provide certificates that say that these labourers have not been paid compensation, he added.(Names of the people rescued have been changed to protect their identities)"

Moreover, the expenditure incurred on new procurements is made only after stringent scrutiny at various levels.However, the Corporation administration feels that the huge expense it has to bear in running Amma Unavagam has become an unbearable and unwanted burden since the venture is a huge loss maker ever since it came into existence.As of now, the Corporation is operating Amma Unavagam at 10 places under its jurisdiction after creating the infrastructure facilities required for uninterruptedly running the canteens in designated buildings at the cost of Rs. 2.50 crore. Though these canteens feed the poorest of the poor with idly in the morning and sambar rice and curd rice in the afternoon at the heavily subsidised cost, it inflicts a loss of Rs. 2.43 crore a year to the Corporation.The Corporations Amma Unavagam sell 12,000 idlies every day and in the afternoon, 3,000 sambar rice and 2,800 curd rice are being sold on an average. While getting annual revenue of Rs. 1.32 crore, the Corporation has to spend Rs. 3.75 crore for running the Amma Unavagam. In other words, this venture causes a loss of Rs. 2.43 crore to the Corporation, said a senior Corporation official, who wants the Tamil Nadu Government to allot a sum in the States Budget for running the Amma Unavagam across Tamil Nadu so that it would not be a burden to the urban local bodies.We want to make it clear that we dont want to shy away from the social responsibility of feeding the downtrodden people. If were assisted financially by the State Government in continuing this venture, well do it with more commitment and a lot of satisfaction, said the officer."

On the other hand, the Congress was the voice of people, he said.Referring to the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France he alleged that the Modi government had caused over Rs. 40,000 crore loss to the exchequer as the purchase has been finalised at a higher price by the NDA government than the previous deal negotiated by the UPA government.The UPA had negotiated it to Rs. 526 crore per plane. But the Modi government paid Rs. 1,670 crore instead, he said.The Congress president said that the government was to purchase the fighter jets from the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited in Bengaluru. But the Hindustan Ki Chowkidar changed the contract and ensured that his friends got it. Where did Rs. 40,000 crore go? he asked.Mr. Gandhi said that the Union Defence Minister lied to people by saying that the cost of purchase cannot be revealed as the deal with France was a secret pact. But the French president has denied it. Finally, it was revealed through the company which supplied it.He said that the State was the land of Basavanna, Narayana Guru, Koti Chennaya and Rani Abbakka who showed the way to the world and not only to the country.Mr. Gandhi said that the erstwhile Congress government in the Centre ensured that the banking services reached every village in the country.Questioning the BJP for stating that the Union government was supplying rice for Anna Bhagya scheme of the Congress government, the Chief Siddaramaiah questioned why the BJP ruled states in the country did not have such a scheme.He said the BJP did a U-turn in its stand over supporting Aadhaar.When it was in the Opposition it opposed it.

According to the Union Ministry of Shipping, a detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared on the project, and work is likely to be awarded in 2018-19.Sagarmala is an ambitious programme for port-centric development, and it was approved by the Union Cabinet in early 2015. The programme envisages exploiting the 7,500-km Indian coastline and 14,500 km of navigable inland waterway stretches.Cochin Port Trust has a 5-MMTPA LNG terminal on Puthuvype island.

5b1483cc9855b75db2e6c86c,A piece of Jharkhand in Kerala,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-piece-of-jharkhand-in-kerala/article23396199.ece,2018-03-31,"The migrant workers at the plantations in Munnar enjoy a quality of life not available to their counterparts in most other parts of India. Workers from Jharkhand and Odisha play a hockey match at the Gundumalai tea estate. (Below) Rahil Lomga, a Hindi teacher at a lower primary school in the same tea estate.Thulasi KakkatOn a pleasant Sunday afternoon in the upper reaches of Munnar, on a playfield hidden in the rolling slopes of the Gundumalai tea estate, a game of hockey is in progress. Just beyond the sidelines, standing beside an old cricket pitch roller, six-year-old Lalita Barayudh, still in her school uniform, takes an imaginary slap shot with a crooked twig. She follows the unfolding game with keen interest.The series of weekend hockey matches between plantation workers from Jharkhand and Odisha are played on an improvised pitch marked out with quicklime, often with a goat as a wager. The main organiser is Lalitas father, Lipi Barayudh, a tribal Munda youth from Jharkhands Khunti district. Lipi is the man responsible for bringing nearly 400 labourers from his native State to work in the tea gardens of the Kanan Devan Hills Plantations (KDHP) in Munnar. He is a playmaker in hockey as well, playing on the centre-midfield position.The idyllic scene of a hockey match unfolding in the cool environs of the hills repeats itself every weekend. It also points to the changing profile of workers in Keralas plantation sector, where the receding Tamil labour population is being rapidly replaced by workers from the tribal districts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, besides Muslims from Assam.Train to prosperityKDHP alone has engaged thousands of them, mostly as whole family units, to work as plantation and tea factory workers. For the record, the Gundumalai estate has on its rolls 1,368 workers, including a few migrant workers from eastern India. But the 713-strong temporary workforce is entirely from the migrant community.Its their Persian Gulf, laughs Jeevan Raj, manager of the Gundumalai estate. Deprivation back home, coupled with a dire shortage of blue-collar workers in Kerala, is driving the trend. Unlike the typical labour migration involving young, male footloose labour, Keralas plantation sector  primarily tea, coffee and cardamom estates spread over Idukki, Thrissur and Palakkad districts  has witnessed the relocation of entire families, mostly from the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Muslim communities looking for socio-economic security and mobility. Workers from Jharkhand typically hop on to the Dhanbad-Alappuzha Express and alight at Tiruppur for the onward journey to Munnar in Idukki.The migrant workers at these plantations enjoy a quality of life not available to their counterparts in most other parts of India. Lipi, with a middle school education, was working at a coffee plantation at Yercaud in Tamil Nadu when two of his co-workers left for the greener pastures of Munnar. He followed suit in 2014. His mother is now a permanent worker at KDHP, entitled to 14 days of paid leave and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), besides health care benefits, gratuity, and incentives.Lipis wife, a temporary worker, enjoys the same benefits minus paid leave and LTA. With a robust network in his home town, Lipi started bringing more families to the plantation and acts as a vital link between these workers and the company. You may get higher wages in big cities, but they will still fall far short of your housing, health care, and livelihood requirements. And if an accident at the workplace leaves you incapacitated, you are left to fend for yourself, says Lipi, who takes pride in being able to send Lalita, in Class 2, to a CBSE school. Her schooling costs him about Rs. 40,000 annually.Apart from decent employment, Kerala also holds other charms for Lipi. The hills of Munnar are cool and breezy, with friendly people, he says. In the town, nobody stops you from going to a temple, mosque or church. Our caste doesnt stand in our way.From tea-picker to Hindi teacherThe Lomga couple has more or less the same story to tell. Also from the Munda tribe, Amos Lomga, a matriculate from West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, used to drive a pickup van in Palamau. After seven years, he had nothing to show in the form of savings. Amos and his wife Rahil, a Hindi graduate from Khunti, followed in a relatives footsteps to Kerala. They both found a job and a home in the plantation.Amos and Rahil were both tea pickers when in October, the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) engaged the latter to teach Hindi at a lower primary school in the estate. There are about 45 children, and over half are Hindi-speaking. Earlier, just three children of migrant workers from the lower division used to come to school. Now there are seven, and even Tamil children have started communicating in Hindi, says Rahil, as her husband demonstrates his fluency in Tamil. Within the community, they speak Mundari or Sadri (also called Nagpuri). But the multicultural environment has given confidence to their only son, Olive Bikas. The mamas and mamis made us comfortable right from the beginning, says Rahil. They own farmland back home, where rice and pulses are cultivated by Amoss brothers. He says the job has made him fit and a game of hockey transports the community to Jharkhand, where hockey is very popular. We dont want to buy a bike now as the priority is to save up for the boys studies, says Amos.Sunita Devi and her husband, from the OBC Kumhar community, came to work in Munnar last June at the suggestion of her brother-in-law. She has learnt tea leaf picking and the art of manuring the tea plants. Her only grouse is that leafy vegetables are at a premium in these parts.Migrants from the east constitute 80% of the workforce in the Kadukumudi division of the estate. In other divisions, their percentage is at level with that of the locals. Estates are divided area-wise into divisions for administrative purposes. There are Thenmalai, Benmore, Lower, Upper, Kadukumudi and many other divisions constituting the Gundumalai estate.Indira Gandhi, supervisor of the lower division for two years, says shes quite happy with the 50 hardworking migrants who report to her. I communicate with them in Tamil, which they pick up fast. They come to me for anything they need, be it a requirement in the lines [their living quarters in the plantation, typically comprising three to five dwelling units] or for permission to go to the dispensary.Estate doctor Naveen Kumar recalls that initially it was difficult to get the migrants to the dispensary. Even pregnancies would be kept secret till the last term, but things are different now. We have placed emphasis on hygiene, and on ante- and post-natal care to arrest malnutrition. We beat the language barrier by running a visual campaign on the importance of birth control. We have also intervened to curb instances of alcohol abuse and domestic violence, he says.Medical screening at a tertiary care hospital in Devikulam is a mandatory part of the recruitment process for migrant workers, and the State health department has been making frequent visits to the estate to prevent communicable diseases, says Raj. The KDHP covers the expenses for the first two pregnancies up to Rs. 60,000 each, and this has helped underscore the need for birth control.Seamless integrationPremchand and Bamini were tilling the fields in Khunti until three years ago, when they decided to work in Munnar. They have just had a baby and a new bike, bought on cash payment. He believes in one bike per delivery policy, jokes Manimekhalai, a resource person of the SSA in the region. As is the case with many Tamils in the region, Manimekhalais parents still work in the plantations, something the next generation is keen to avoid.Both the sons of Subramaniam, the estate watcher, have sought careers outside of the sector. They do not want to do hard labour as we have done, he says. A native of Tenkasi, Subramaniam hopes to build a house on the three cents of land he owns there, once he and his wife retire from their plantation jobs. Until then, we can stay in the lines. He is happy to be in the company of these workers from Jharkhand and Odisha. Without them, we wouldnt get a break as there would be no one to share the workload. This is also echoed by the caretaker at the crche in the lower division, Arul Jyothi, whose two sons work outside the plantation as lecturer and engineer.Such seamless integration with the local community is perhaps why the migrant workers have been so welcome. The first batch of migrants from these parts, starting with Pithai Munda, who arrived over five years ago and has a child studying in the nearby CBSE school, landed almost empty-handed. The locals provided them warm clothes, took them to the clinic, and helped them settle down until the company took over, issuing them the items needed for daily life. Earlier, they would ask an older kid in the community to look after the infants. But with the governments help, we were able to push almost all the children to school and infants to the crches, where they can have a balanced diet. In fact, the salary of SSA teachers like Rahil is too little compared to what is earned by a worker in the plantation, but the position is empowering. It has helped the community become more aware of the need to educate their children. When the school is on a holiday, Rahil works in the field, says Raj.The real challenge for the government is to address the growing aspirations of the migrant labour community from the Hindi belt. They would need Hindi medium schools and colleges for their wards, Raj adds.Workers like Premchand had slogged in the construction sector in Mumbai before arriving in Munnar. Now Premchand gets to save at least Rs. 10,000 a month in preparation for his childs schooling five years down the line. Over the years, social networking and matrimonial alliances have carried word about these job opportunities from Jharkhand to neighbouring Odisha as well. Subhash Gudia and Maxwell Topno from Sundargarh work in the estate factory and live with four others in a bachelors pad in the line. We encourage families or single men in groups of four or five, says Raj.Muslim families do not get employed in the plantations in Assam, according to Abdul Salam and Mansur Ali, from Udalguri district. In Munnar for a few years, they have also brought in their in-laws and extended family to work in the tea gardens. Its a five-day journey for us and we take the Guwahati-Trivandrum Express. Our women do not get employment even in West Bengal, says Ali. His brother used to work in the plantation before returning to Assam, where he now owns two autorickshaws. The Assamese workers prolonged absence from the plantations has been a thorny issue, says Raj. While some return home for a month or two for no particular reason, some are forced to stay back due to verification requirements of the National Register of Citizens.A win-win phenomenonA recent survey by the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) documented the presence of a large number of migrant workers from the tribal districts of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Assam and Bihar in Nedumkandam, Peerumedu, Devikulam and Udumbanchola in Idukki, Mannarkkad and Nelliyampathy in Palakkad, and Malakkappara in Thrissur. Although migrants from distant States are not skilled enough to work in plantations, shortage of labour has been forcing plantation managements to hire them. Plantations tend to hire families as they are less likely to move quickly compared to single men. Because of this, theres a significant number of migrant children in the plantation areas, the study, published in a volume titled Gods Own Workforce , noted.The Economic Survey of the Kerala State Planning Board, published in January, points out that the decadal growth rate of Keralas population, going by the 2011 Census, was 4.9%, the lowest among States, with Pathanamthitta and Idukki districts registering negative population growth rates. Given the situation, the influx of migrant labour from the east presents a win-win for all these States as well as Kerala, says Benoy Peter, executive director of CMID.The tribal districts of these States are marred by inequitable human development and disparities in the sharing of livelihood opportunities. This has forced these people to look towards Kerala, a frontrunner in social development. The Tamil youth who used to fill the labour vacuum have become upwardly mobile. This has paved the way for mobilisation of a captive workforce that could carry out hard labour as demanded by the sector. For the undereducated, less informed youth in the source States, it is a survival strategy. Relatively high wage rates, sustainable job opportunities, a peaceful social environment and less discriminatory treatment, besides access to free health care, education, housing, and socio-economic mobility, are all factors that pull them to Keralas plantations. It is just a matter of time before they become its mainstay, says Peter. In the meantime, their remittances are sure to have a positive impact on the social development of their native States as well. Strong social networks, direct rail connectivity, ease of sending money home, and better communication facilities are all factors catalysing the long-distance migration, he says.But there are challenges too. First and foremost, not every plantation is keen on the social development of the community, and labour exploitation is by no means unknown. Kerala, with its ageing population and changing demography, should gear up for a large-scale social intervention of the kind that it had marshalled in the 1970s and 1980s, because the future of its human development will depend on the pace with which the migrant population catches up with the States present level. It is therefore imperative to have migrant-inclusive development plans, says Peter.R. Pramod, chief inspector of plantations, Kerala, argues that all the workers in the sector, irrespective of their place of origin, are paid wages as fixed by the Plantation Labour Committee. But there is no guarantee that wages and allowances are uniform across the sector, as only those plantations with an area of at least five hectares and employing a minimum of 15 workers are registered with the Chief Inspector of Plantations.Data available with us shows that there are 58,000 workers in 634 estates in Kerala, not counting those working in the more than one lakh minor plantations, Pramod says. There is no separate data on the quantum of migrant labour force in the minor plantation sector. These workers are covered under the relatively new Small Plantation Workers Welfare Fund Board, which is only subscribed by 16,000 workers.Implementation of the States Awas insurance scheme for migrant workers, which guarantees medical care of up to Rs. 15,000 and insurance worth Rs. 2 lakh in case of death by accident, has made slow progress. Only about 2.5 lakh workers out of an estimated population of 30 to 40 lakh have been brought under its ambit so far.As the CMID study concludes, Kerala needs to realise that it needs the migrant labourers more than they need it. Ultimately, the mainstreaming of migrant workers holds the key to successful integration.Their remittances are sure to have a positive impact on the social development of their native States as well.Benoy PeterExecutive director, Centre for Migration and Inclusive DevelopmentYou may get higher wages in big cities, but they will still fall far short of your housing, health care, and livelihood requirements.Lipi BarayudhA temporary worker from Jharkhand"

V. Anand on Saturday announced that while the Ration From Anywhere facility was introduced within each district on an experimental basis, it would be rolled out across all districts of the State from Sunday. Mr. Anand said the decision had been taken, keeping in mind the migration of cardholders from one place to another.To procure essential commodities, they would have to travel to where their ration shops are. This would mean a lot of money on travel. The portability will allow them to get essential commodities from a ration shop close to their residence, Mr. Anand said. Further, members of a family would now have the facility to individually procure essential commodities from different FPS in different parts of the State.Touching upon the monitoring mechanism, Mr. Anand said, As soon as a beneficiary, for example, buys rice, he or she will get a text message. This will show the beneficiary how much has been taken. He clarified that while it had come to notice that several beneficiaries had not been taking ration, their cards would not be revoked. Mr. Anand encouraged cardholders to download the T-Ration app on their smart phones.

Venkaiah Naidu suggested that agriculture students stay with farmers be made mandatory.In an interaction with the researchers of Indian Institute of Rice Research here on Saturday, he asked students as well as scientists to spend considerable time with farmers to come up with practical solutions to their problems.He said the most critical need was to establish a dialogue with farmers and provide them with knowledge and material resources to increase their income. There was a need to educate farmers not just on various possibilities of diversifying the crop, but give them facilities for taking up allied activities like dairy, fisheries and poultry. Awareness on various cropping patterns based on soil profile and water availability in different agro-climatic zones was an important aspect in improving agriculture productivity.It would be beneficial if there is a two-way dialogue between agriculture scientists and farmers so that it helps the former in studying their innovative practices apart from understanding their problems, he said.A release said Mr. Naidu posed several questions to scientists and elicited their responses on how their research translated to empowering farmers.He stressed on the need for increasing both productivity and production as the country could not depend on imported food security for long."

Besides, it is not viable owing to peculiar climatic and soil conditions, particularly during the kharif season.This was stated by witness for AP P.V. Satyanarayana, an agriculture scientist who is also Director of AP Rice Research Institute, before the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal hearing the issue of sharing of Krishna waters by AP and Telangana at New Delhi on Tuesday. He was probed by senior counsels for Telangana C.S. Vaidyanathan and V. Ravinder Rao as part of his cross examination on cropping patterns and soil and climatic conditions in the Krishna Basin areas.On being asked about the recommendation of the National Disaster Management Authority for cultivation of short duration and short height paddy crop in AP as part of its guidelines in respect of management of cyclones, Mr. Satyanarayana said he would have to verify it. He was asked the question after eliciting information about incidence of cyclones during October-November.Asked whether it is the long duration paddy crop that is affected by cyclones in November and the short duration crop is not impacted by the phenomenon, the APs witness denied the suggestion and stated that the farmers have evolved cultivating long duration paddy in Krishna Delta due to the adverse effect of cyclones and heavy rains up to November third week.He admitted that temperature would have effect on the grain filling in paddy but denied the argument of the senior counsel Mr. Vaidyanathan that the drop in temperature by about 1.5 degree to 2 degree Celsius during October-November in Krishna Delta would impact the paddy production there.He sought to verify the relevant document when the counsel for Telangana stated that drop in temperature by one degree would result in reduction in yield to an extent of 654 kg per hectare. Telanganas counsel that reduction of 30 days in the length of crop growing period (LGP) would result in saving almost 6 tmc ft water per every one lakh acres paddy cultivation., the APs witness admitted that water requirement for short duration paddy with 120 days to 125 days LGP would be comparatively less against long duration paddy with 145 days to 150 days LGP."

5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"

The lynching of Madhu, a mentally challenged Adivasi, at Mukkali pained me a lot. I came to know from newspapers that many people now distribute rice and pulses in Attappady. Adivasis are not beggars and such charity will not empower the indigenous people. So I am planning food security interventions, Mr. Mohankumar told The Hindu .A network of farmersThe artist, who promoted organic farming practices among tribespeople of Devar Gadda in Wayanad, Korome in Wayanad, and Kolli Hills in Namakkal, is now planning a similar venture in Attappady. In fact, he plans to create a network of tribal farmers from these regions. The finest seeds of pulses, millets, cereals and vegetables would be sourced from tribes of other regions and supplied among Attappady tribes. Farming experts from other tribal regions will reach Attappady to teach farming practices. The farming activities would be closely monitored and the surplus grains and vegetables would be sold in the open market.Kudumbasrees roleWhen I shared the concept with Palakkad MP M.B. Rajesh and officials of Kudumbasree Mission, they offered me all support. So I am venturing into it with confidence, he said.His idea is to supply seeds to tribal farmers and buy back the produce to retail through Kudumbasree. His previous efforts had brought about a system whereby ample food and remuneration was ensured for the impoverished families. Mr. Mohankumar is also planning to encourage tribal women in Attappady to make indigenous pickles and snacks, which will be of high demand outside.I will draw pictures during my forthcoming visits to Attappady which will be auctioned through exhibitions in cities. I will not take even a single rupee from the proceeds in the next five years. Artists have a moral obligation to engage in tribal cause, he said.In 1988, Mr. Mohankumar was listed by UNESCO as one of the 40 greatest artists of the world. He was also honoured by Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, and his works don the walls of several public spaces and corporate offices across the country.Adivasis are not beggars and charity will not empower them.

The bypass changed the area and lives of people here. Farming along a stretch of 8.8 km of the Paliyekkara-Mannuthy bypass was stopped soon after the inauguration of the bypass.Farming was done at Kuttanellur-Thodukulam fields till 2011 and Elangikulam fields till 2014, according to a study conducted by the Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP).Many paddy fields have been reclaimed on both sides of the highway, said C. Prasad, T. Sreenath, and K.K. Aneesh Kumar of a KSSP investigation team.The fields have become a dump of hazardous waste. The waste dumped on both sides of the Thalore fields and emissions from umpteen workshops, service stations, retreat centres, and the Paliyekkara toll booth flow to Manalippuzha, the team said.The Eravakkadu drinking water project, the only source of drinking water for the area, is situated downstream of Manalippuzha.Real estate developers had already bought vast areas of land on both sides of the bypass even before it was inaugurated. Now, 90% of the paddy fields has been taken over by motor vehicle companies and agencies of building materials. There are 26 automobile showrooms on the Mannuthy-Paliyekkara bypass alone, Mr. Sreenath said.The paddy fields at Nenmanikkara, Thrikkur, Puthur, and Nadathara panchayats and in the Thrissur Corporation are situated on the 8.8-km stretch. Ironically, in 2010, it was declared that Nenmanikkara panchayat had achieved all basic growth targets. The panchayat was self-sufficient in rice production and had drinking water for all houses. But the situation has changed now. According to the panchayat development plan, 97.6% of the paddy fields have been lost. As the watershed was destroyed, the panchayat is facing acute water shortage. Same is the plight of other panchayats.Mobility hubTo top it all, Thrissur Corporation is planning to construct a mobility hub at Elanjikulam where efforts were initiated to restart farming on 12.5 acres last year.The fate of the fields along the Mannuthy-Paliyekkara bypass has a grater relevance at the time of the agitation of Vayalkilikal at Keezhattur. While the bypass is expected to solve traffic congestion, it also exposes the pristine paddy fields on the sides to real estate mafia and mindless waste dumping."

But four farmers from the drought-prone Govindapuram successfully utilised this method in their paddy fields, said B J Pandian, director, Water Technology Centre, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.With 5-6mm average rainfall annually, Govindapuram was one of the drought-affected areas in the district. Since it was located at the tail end of Amaravathi river irrigation scheme, it hardly receives surface irrigation facility, Pandian said.Hence, the four utilised the available water to the maximum effect with the help of drip irrigation. They cultivate three crops a year. They take up onion cultivation in April-May, paddy in November-February and maize in between the two crops, he added.They had been effectively utilising the drip irrigation for rice for the past two year. And with this, they could conserve 30% of water. The drip irrigation consumes only 750mm-800mm water (for 110 days) against the average surface water consumption of 1,250mm. Even the yield could be enhanced from five tonnes per hectare to six tonnes.While many farmers are struggling to cultivate two crops effectively in water-rich regions, the farmers in Govindapuram have succeeded in cultivating three crops with drip irrigation, Pandian said lauding them."

The five-year-old terminal is now exporting rice, sugar, marine produce and paper products by using the weekly scheduled call of M/s Far Shipping.A joint venture of the Kakinada Seaports Limited and the Bothra Shipping Services Private Limited, the KCTPL was launched in 2015 and commenced operations from the next year. Till recently we have handled rice and sugar to the African and the Gulf countries. However, there has been a steady increase in the commodities and the destinations as well, observes M. Subramanian, terminal manager of the KCTPL.In the year 2016-17, the terminal exported rice to the tune of 2,700 TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit that is used to measure a ships cargo carrying capacity) whereas the same has gone to 4,900 TEUs in the current fiscal. Same is the case with the sugar that has gone from 2,800 TEUs to 3,800 TEUs during the corresponding period.Hassle-free executionThe exporters are realising the proximity and competitiveness of the KCTPL hitherto being exported from Visakhapatnam. They are expressing satisfaction over the hassle-free execution of their shipments, he says.The terminal accepts a minimum quantity of 20 tonnes, as the average capacity of container is 26 tonnes. Since there has been a steady increase in the frequency of vessels, the shipping time is getting reduced steadily. With regard to the export of marine produce, the volume of reefer containers during the current fiscal is likely to reach 250 TEUs, whereas the same was registered as 64 TEUs in the last financial year.The destinations for the reefers increased from the United States to the Europe and Gulf countries.Denmark-based Maersk Line has announced the launch of import services to Kakinada, which is a long-pending demand from the local trade fraternity. This will accelerate the activities of the terminal and the frequency of cargo movement will be intensified further, Mr. Subramanian explains."

Apart from their domestic utility as domestic utensils, the grinding stones and crushing stones are still considered auspicious components that augur well for the growth and development of households.With the advent of electrically-operated mixers and wet grinders, house-makers are totally relieved of physical strain. However, it is a considered view that the quality and texture of rice flour got through these conventional stones is superior to one electrically operated equipment. The demand for the grinding stones and crushing stones is very meagre. However, the hereditary artisans continue in this business, as they were not aware of other trades.Devaraj (60), of Attur town, is involved in the making of grinding and crushing stones for the past four decades. The demand for these stones has fallen steeply in the one decade.While the crushing stone is priced at Rs. 600, the price of the grinding stone is Rs. 1,000.

Under normal circumstances, half the area would have been harvested by now, but only 1.75% of the harvest has been completed so far in the current season.In a last-ditch effort to save the standing crop raised on 10.7lakh acres in the Cauvery delta, the rice bowl of the state, the government on Thursday released 10,000cusecs (cubic feet per second) from the Mettur reservoir, despite dwindling storage. While the sluice gates of the Mettur dam should have be opened in June last year, due to poor inflow water was released only on October 2, 2017.The supply may not last long, given Karnatakas decision not to release water from its reservoirs Krishnarajasagar , Kabini, Hemavathy and Harangi . Their combined storage is at 42% of their capacity at present. The standing crop badly requires one or two wettings. The release from Mettur may continue for the next few days in the range of 10,000cusecs to 7,500cusecs, but cannot be guaranteed further. The available water will have to be used for drinking water supply too until the next monsoon, said a government official.Currently, Mettur has a storage of only 19.9tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) as against a total capacity of 93.47tmcft. About five tmcft is dead storage, which means only about 15 tmcft is usable.After a year of drought, the state is pinning its hopes on available water to save at least two-thirds of the crop by the first week of February. Delta farmers are, however, losing hopes of a good yield. Standing crop on at least five lakh acres is at risk for want of water. Unless we get our due from Karnataka , the crop will wither, said TMC farmers wing president Puliyur Nagarajan.The long-term samba crop raised on 18,747 acres alone was harvested until Monday last and a sizeable area is getting ready for harvest in the next few days. In about 40,000 acres in Nagapattinam district, where the crop was raised very late, water is required for the next one month. The first crop got damaged extensively due to heavy spell of rains. What is available now is replanted paddy The state has fixed a target of realising food production of 100 lakh MT this year, twice the quantity produced last year. Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association general secretary S Ranganathan said the PWD exhausted 20ft of water in ten days recently. They could have been prudent in saving water and supplying to specific areas where water was needed. If so, water supply could have been maintained till the first week of February, he said.At least 20% of the crop requires water immediately. We are at the mercy of Karnataka and appeal to the state to do the needful, he said."

Ravinder Rao during the hearing in New Delhi on Wednesday as part of the continued cross-examination of P.V. Satyanarayana, APs witness, who is also the Director of AP Rice Research Institute. He was probed on the aspects of climatic zones, soil types and cropping patterns in the Krishna Basin areas for the third consecutive day.On the aspects of rainfall in the Krishna Basin areas in Telangana, its counsel said the map of isohyets - lines on a map connecting points having the same amount of rainfall in a given period - of combined AP filed as annexures before the tribunal, the range of rainfall for southern Telangana zone was 700 mm to 800 mm except for small portion in Mahabubnagar with 600 mm. Contrary to that, Mr. Satyanarayana has shown the rainfall range as 500 mm to 670 mm in his affidavit, Mr. Ravinder Rao submitted to the tribunal.Mr. Satyanarayana denied the argument and said he had quoted the range as per the document prepared by Telangana government for the National Food Security Mission and as mentioned at the national conference for kharif campaign. He agreed to furnish the documentary source of the rainfall figures in his affidavit.Telanganas counsel said although 98.5% of area of erstwhile Rangareddy district is in the Krishna Basin, APs witness had not taken it into consideration while taking districts of AP falling outside the basin for the purpose of length of crop growing period. He further noted that 47.5% area of erstwhile Warangal and 43.5% of erstwhile Khammam fall in the Krishna Basin.

The Green revolution which resulted in food security reduced production and consumption of millets. Earlier millets were produced in plenty. Between rice, wheat and millets, there should be a balance of production, said Dr. Vilas A. Tonapi, director general, Indian Institute of Millets Research-Hyderabad.Out of 47,000 grains available for consumption in India, people eat only two, rice and wheat, he pointed out. Further, processed rice provides only starch and nutrient deficiency in staple diet causes malnutrition. Mr. Tonapi asked governments in the Centre and State to give incentives for the production of millets so that farmers are encouraged to cultivate these.Millets prevent cardiovascular diseases, colon cancer hypertension and acidity. The food that we currently eat cause such medical complications, Mr. Tonapi added.In north India, malnutrition is higher compared to the south. In such places millets including jowar, bazra and ragi should be consumed as they are storehouses of nutrients, experts opined. Akhil Kumar Gawar, director of Telangana Food Processing Society pointed out that the State is still dependent on millets. Of 3,000 food processing industries in Telangana just 2,200 are rice mills he said."

Reacting to the statement of independent MLC V Balasubramanyam that farmers were forced to sell paddy at prices way below the MSP, the Minister said such statements make farmers sell at rates mentioned by political leaders. Intervening in a short discussion on Agriculture support activities, growth, drought proofing and Rythu bazaars in the Council, the Minister said farmers were already in a precarious state of mind. He said it would be better if political leaders made statements that were encouraging. He said the farmers should be told that the government was ready to purchase any amount of grain at the MSP. The Minister said the situation this year was slightly different from the previous years. A few countries that were importing rice had suddenly stopped or reduced the demand. Similarly, there was no demand from Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Odisha as there was a surplus there. Mr. Balasubramanayam however said he was stating the facts on distress sale.Sugarcane cultivationIn the question hour, the MLCs were told that the area under sugarcane cultivation had decreased in the East Godavari district. Diversion from sugarcane to more remunerative crops like paddy, palm oil, maize and tapioca was given as the reason. The scarcity of labour in general and for harvesting in particular was another. The Minister said the government was ensuring that Rs. 3,400 was being paid per tonne while the Central government had fixed the fair and remunerative price at Rs. 2,550 per tonne."

However, the department had provided him medical care and treatment for depression from 2012 to 2014. But he had discontinued free treatment given at the Kottathara tribal hospital.

Chicken, beef, mutton, lamb, pork  you name it and we gorge on it. We love meat, says 78-year-old Pamela Rebeiro, as she escorts us down the narrow, cool corridor of her Collin Street house. Pamela, who is an Anglo-Indian, is a fantastic cook, quite known within the community. Even our aloo chops are meat croquettes coated with potato. Aloo just got a bit of lip-service! she laughs.Pamela is among the last few of a vanishing tribe of middle-aged or older women who know the secrets of Anglo-Indian cuisine  one of the most prominent pillars of Kolkatas diverse culinary heritage. In and around Ripon Street, Elliott Road and other Anglo-Indian bastions in central Kolkata, women like Pamela bent over bubbling pots and pans and red-hot ovens as they dished out delicacies like juicy jalfrezi, tangy pepper water, rich ball curry, yellow rice, pantras and more. Lunch after Sunday service was an elaborate affair as the lanes would fill up with the rich aromas as families congregated around the table over food, conversation and maybe some music later in the afternoon. Much of that magic is gone, with flickers of that life and lifestyle surviving in corners like Bow Barracks.There was a time when I used to cook for many, many people. We used to host parties almost every day. My husband, Rubin Rebeiro, was a musician, who used to play at Princes in Grand Hotel. He used to have hundreds of visitors. Ours was a buzzing house. Today, I live alone as my son works in Hyderabad and I dont feel like cooking for myself. However, hes got married and my daughter-in-law will be staying with me; so things may change, says Pamela.People who grew up in and around central Kolkata have a deep connection with the community and its food. There was a mansion in front of my Beniapukur house in which lived four or five Anglo-Indian families. One of them was Mr Jardine, recalls actor-musician-director Anjan Dutt , whos had a strong association with the community since childhood. He had a very beautiful daughter, Alison, and I liked her a lot. I was very young then. They used to make some amazing kofta curry and yellow rice. The smell used to drift to our house and I used to gorge on the food. I dont know if it was because of my tender age, or my strong admiration for Alison, but the mind-blowing flavour of that food is etched in my mind. I have never tasted any other plate of ball curry-yellow rice tastier than that. Now, they are all gone, the director adds.There are not many families left, to start with, says Reethu Sarawgi, a septuagenarian retired teacher of La Martiniere for Girls, Kolkata. The Anglo-Indian community felt isolated after Independence. Almost all my friends left by the early 60s for the UK, Canada and Australia , she adds. Reethu feels her food habits have been influenced by her friends or her hostel life in school. If you went to a school that is under the Church of North India, you would develop a love for Anglo food. I remember the delicious sausage curry and country captain  dry beef curry  made by a dear friend of mine, Yvonne Pinto, who passed away recently. I will never forget that taste, rues Reethu, who is a Malayali by birth but grew up with Anglo-Indian friends, and still savours Anglo food almost every day.But it is not just the exodus, there are other factors to it too, says Anjan. The wine-and-dine culture of Park Street died a sad death due to the heavy entertainment tax. Once my friend, musician Nondon Bagchi, and I held an informal survey and counted around 600 entertainers on Park Street  musicians, cabaret dancers, singers and so on. The whole lot of those people left, and with them, their culture also left, the director adds.However, Anglo-Indian cuisine has never really been part of restaurant business in Kolkata. There are places that serve one or two items like jalfrezi and roast, but eateries dedicated to the cuisine have been a rarity. Traditionally, the authentic food is cooked in almost every Anglo household even today. A family lunch will mean a week-long preparation involving shopping for meat, marinating it with right ingredients, buying dill and other herbs and then finally preparing it, which could go on for a couple of days.While we definitely love other cuisines, we eat Anglo-Indian food almost every day at our house. I had yellow rice and ball curry today, and yesterday mashi (the cook, a lady from Nadia) made pantras. My daughters are equally happy if they have pasta for dinner but our generation is a bit more traditional and we love our food, says Barry OBrien, quizmaster and president-in-chief of The All-India Anglo-Indian Association . We Anglo-Indians take our food very seriously. Families swear by their cook, who used to be called boy, khansama or bowchi (derived from bawarchi). In my childhood, we used to have a fantastic cook, Appana Rao, who was from the Andhra-Odisha border. I remember, we never used to take packed lunch to our school, St Xaviers, as it would get cold. Appana used to cook and the fresh hot lunch in tiffin carriers would be brought to school, recalls Barry.Also, Anglo-Indians have a special inclination for leftover food. Cooking a little extra is our kitchen culture, mainly for two reasons  to cater to sudden, wanted or unwanted, guests, and to relish the dish a day later, says Barry. By far my favourite breakfast over the years has been quarter-boiled eggs, (not half-boiled, not hard-boiled!) mashed with aloo chops from dinner the night before, he adds.A family lunch can mean a week-long preparation and daylong cooking. Our families are closely knit. We still try and meet on every occasion for a large meal. Typical Anglo families still carry on this tradition, says Christine Beaucasin, who works at the Oral School for Deaf Children. Our parties are still incomplete without jalfrezi, vindaloo, pantras, roasts and so on, she adds.But are there shops dedicated to Anglo-Indian groceries? Not really. We use a lot of onions, ginger, garlic, tomato. You can buy them from anywhere, really. For meat and the sausages, we go to New Market or Entally bazar, says Christina Samuel. We usually have an elaborate three course meal  soup, side dishes and desserts. Each day of the Christmas holiday season has been extremely busy for us. We were either invited to someones place for lunch or dinner or some friends or family visited us, says Christina. While the tradition of cooking runs in family, tedious items like ball curry and butt curry are going out of fashion, she says.Is the younger generation a tad reluctant to carry forward the cuisine of the community? While a section of the older generation thinks so, many of the youngsters dont agree. Our food is a family affair. It passes from one generation to the next. I love to cook. I make fantastic steaks. Anglo men are usually good cooks as they love to eat, quips Joshua Samuel, Christinas 32-year-old son.Brandon Claudius, son of hockey player Olympian Leslie Claudius agrees. I dont get time every day due to my erratic work hours but I am also a foodie. Korma, bhuni vindaloo  I love to eat and I love to cook for my family, he says. His wife, Jilian, too, cooks Anglo food almost every day at home. There are many Anglo-Indian snacks including kul kul and rose cookies that we used to make at home before Christmas. Now, we buy them from the market as those are very elaborate, she adds.However, for those who are reluctant to cook, you have home delivery. Ive never enjoyed cooking and Ive never cooked. Ive always sourced my food from reliable home deliveries. And more often than not, I get Anglo food, says Reethu.Veronica Pacheco, a retired service woman, delivers lunch and dinner to around 15 families every day. They are all retired people. I have a dabbawala who delivers the lunch boxes to them. The menu is simple  rice, dal, sabzi and one non-veg item of fish, beef or pork, she tells us. Apart from the retired households, Veronica also delivers to the clubs that serve Anglo-Indian food on special occasions. Usually at Bingo parties, I prepare food for around 150 people. I served everywhere  Dalhousie Institute, Calcutta Rangers Club, Armenian Club and all. I prepare thorough Anglo-Indian food  aloo chops, shami beef tikias, pantras, cutlets, pork roast, tongue roast. My father, Vivian George Thompson was a very good cook and he taught me. When I lost my husband in 2012, I started feeling a bit lonely and so I chose to engage myself like this, says Veronica, who stays alone as her son works in Melbourne.If you havent tasted Anglo-Indian sausages, you are missing out on a slice of life Kolkata has to offer. These hard-core pork sausages are far from the skinny machine-made Frankfurters you get at shopping mall freezers. Anglo-Indian sausages are stuffed with onion, ginger, aromatic herbs and sets of secret spice mixes apart from mince. We make our own masala. From the garam masalas to haldi and coriander  we grind them to make it perfect, says Bablu Khatik who runs Chamans Pork Shop at Park Circus market with his brother Rahul and uncle Sunil. Cooking the sausages also involves a unique process. You dont need to grill or fry them; as they need boiling for at least 40 minutes. Here is a small tip for you. Take water just adequate to boil the sausages. Bring it to boil along with the meat (with pierced skin) and cook it till the water is absorbed. The meat will be cooked by the fat it releases. From balanced heat to right spices and sweetness of onions and cinnamon, the tastes explode in your mouth with a bang. The only problem is these sausages are not widely sold. Besides Park Circus market, you can find them at Entally market, Taltala market and New Market.Yellow rice-ball (or kofta curry): Rich meatball curry with flavoured rice cooked in coconut milk with a pinch of turmericPork vindaloo: Goan and Anglo-Indians fight over this spicy dish. We hijacked vindaloo from Goan cuisine and now we make it better, quipsBarry OBrienJalfrezi with white rice and pepper water: This meat preparation is on the dry side. Pepper water has no pepper in it but the gravy is made of tamarind paste and other masalas. You have to have white rice to enjoy the platterPantras: Deep-fried, meat-stuffed pancakesAloo chops: Croquettes made of minced-meat, coated with potatoHaddiguddi ballychow: Ballychow is a prawn paste that is used as an ingredient. Pork bones and a little bit of meat is cooked with ballychow and a lot of tomatoes"
5b14afc69855b72ada07e454,"In the Surla-Tar masjid, Muslims and Hindus gather in peace",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-the-surla-tar-masjid-muslims-and-hindus-gather-in-peace/articleshow/62494476.cms,2018-01-14,"Nestled between the rich red laterite soils of Surla, the aquatic expanse of River Mandovi, and a lush green forest, the masjid of Surla-Tar is one of the oldest surviving mosques in Goa, dating to the Adil Shah era.Referred to by its geographical name, the masjid of Surla-Tar is said to have been constructed by Ibrahim Adil Shah in the 16th century.While the architecture bears resemblance to the Safa masjid in Ponda , it lacks a similar visual allure.Locals say that in the days of yore there was no road leading down to the mosque. Only a dense cashew and mango forest surrounded its premises. Believers would either hike all the way to gain access to the prayer chamber or cross the river on a raft, a mode of transport that was upgraded to canoes and later, ferries. Eventually, a tarred road was constructed down the hill, making transit easy for visitors.The masjid, however, lost most of its original structure to the ravages of time until it was rebuilt in 1956 and restored to its former glory. The state department of archives and archaeology took over the monument nearly two decades ago and pays occasional visits to the place, residents say.An ancient water tank sits at the foot of this mosque. The serene waters of this reservoir present a stark contrast to the busy marine traffic floating on the Mandovi river.The water tank is not used today. There is a separate tap near the tank, which is used by the faithful for ablutions. There was an underground drainage, which used to run from the tank and empty into the river. At present, the drain is blocked, writes Tinusha Pereira, a Goa College of Architecture alumnus in her study (2009) of the masjid.A single untarred road runs between the mosque and the river bank, which leads to Ganjem-Ambeshi. While two-wheelers can pass over this narrow strip with ease, horses served as the means for passage on this route in the yesteryears.A boat from the Panaji side of the river would arrive carrying wheat, sugar, rice and flour for Surla residents and in return take fruits, kokum and maddi (taro root) from here to Panaji, Harun Xa Muzavor ( Shah Mujawar ), the mosques caretaker, says.In what could be considered a heritage lovers dream residence, Muzavor, an octogenarian, lives in a house which overlooks the historical masjid and the tranquil waters of its tank. He has been its sole caretaker for decades, the responsibility being passed down his family from one generation to another.A dargah (shrine) adjoining the river is cocooned behind the masjid. The remains that lie at this dargah are of a Pir Saheb (saint) and his companion who had come to Goa to build harmony between the conflicting Hindus and Muslims in the pre-Portuguese era. Their names are not known to this date, Muzavor says.Sources reveal that the five-day long Shigmo festival in this area usually concludes with a procession to the mosque. Hindu villagers pay gratitude to the saint for bridging the gap between the two communities. This ceremony is called the bhovartalo.The place is open to both Hindu and Muslims, and we have been visiting it for years. This is a perfect example of communal harmony in Goa, Viraj Govekar, a resident of Surla says.With his descendants moving to other parts of the state, Muzavor is now looking for a successor to take care of the structure. Even though the monument is under the watchful eyes of the department of archives and archaeology today, Muzavor feels that a structure like the masjid of Surla-Tar needs continuous human presence.It is because of this he chooses to stay alone in his ancestral home. I spend my day cleaning the masjid and dargah, sharing information about its heritage with visitors, and looking after the overall management, he says while walking into the chambers to give the zuhur azaan (call for prayer).Despite his efforts, this stunning piece of Islamic architecture is losing its splendour due to negligence in upkeep.Heritage activist Prajal Sakhardande says, The state archaeology department must review the maintenance of this masjid and take care of its upkeep. They must ensure its cleanliness and keep the place litter-free. Periodic inspection of the place must be done."

Vijayalalithambigai, designated officer of FSSAI, said that lamp ghee sold in shops are checked to verify whether the labelling mentions that the product should only be used for lighting lamps and not of edible quality.Labels of lamp ghees checked during the inspections by the officials had labels mentioning that they are made for the use of lighting lamps. Ghee made for such non-edible purpose must bear the label, warning the buyers, said Ms. Vijayalalithambigai.It was alleged that lamp ghee was used for preparing prasadam at Mariamman temple near Mahadevapuram in Mettupalayam on Tuesday.While Loganayagi (60) and Savithri (60) of Nadar Colony near Mahadevapuram died of suspected food poisoning, more than 60 people underwent treatement with complaints of stomach pain and diarrhoea at Government Hospital, Mettupalayam.Officials with the Health Department said that the two women did not come for treatment at the Government hospital.When food safety officials checked with the persons who prepared the prasadam (made of aval - rice flakes), they informed them that lamp ghee was not used for the preparation.However, it was found that lamp ghee was used for lighting lamps at the temple.They showed us a ghee bottle with a label which said that it should be used only for lighting lamps. We could not confirm if it was used in the prasadam as its samples were not avaialable, said a food safety officer.It has also been alleged that the prasadam was prepared previous day night for the ease of serving on Tuesday, which could lead to contamination and growth of micro organisms.M. Chandhirasekaran, Joint Director of Health Services, said that condition of those who undergoing treatment at the Government hospital was stable.He said that the reason for the death of the women could be ascertained based on the autopsy report."

Anands initiatives have increased efficiency while saving on cost. And as his stint draws to a close, Mr. Anand, in a free-wheeling interview with Syed Mohammed, talks about good governance, the age of consumer activism and what the government should do to be more consumer-friendly. Excerpts:How has IT helped to plug leaks in the department?Information Technology has helped reduce the scope of corruption to a great extent. For a long time, officers had been colluding with rice millers and Fair Price Shops owners. For example, there was delay in farmers getting paid for paddy and it even went up to 30 days to 60 days. The Minimum Support Price of around Rs. 1,400 was not given fully. And when the cheques came, they had to add weight (bribe officials) to get them. In consultation with the Centre for Good Governance, IT initiatives are firmly in place and payments are upfront. Even in remotest areas, payments are getting credited in the farmers bank accounts. Rs. 11 lakh crore was paid so far, 80% of which was within three days.How have you tackled the transporter-dealer-miller nexus?There are 1,400 trucks transporting rice. We installed 1,750 CCTVs in 171 godowns, GPS systems in trucks and geo-fenced routes. Previously, about 20% of rice was not taken by the cardholders. So the equivalent was not unloaded from trucks and sold off later at ports and in other States. The command control centre here and in districts keeps a watch on every vantage point 24x7.The gunny bags re-use seems to be an issue. What is your take on it?Instead of the 38% depreciation charges with each use and their eventual auction, the Centre is saying that there will be charges of Rs. 6.30 per use. Last rabi season, analysis revealed that the problems persisted for years and it continued this season too. Procured paddy was not being taken away. Then we found out that gunny bags from Kolkata had not arrived. There was immense cost and effort. Now, by engaging road transport, we have reduced the effort as the truck brings bags to the PPC (paddy procurement centres) directly. Per bale (500 bags) cost has been reduced from Rs. 1,600 to Rs. 1,050.What are the efforts towards a kerosene-free State?Approximately 65% of the ration card holders have got LPG connections in the State. For the next financial year, the Centres Ujwala scheme will have an allocation of 10 lakh connections for us. We have taken this seriously.Consumer fora functioning is slow and some posts are still vacant. What should be done to bridge this gap?It is best to have a separate Consumer Affairs Department. We made the suggestion in one of the meetings with the Centre and it is recorded in the minutes of the meeting. There has been a sea change in consumer affairs and activism over the years."

It is generally followed by the traditional dish of dahi chura , that is a delicious mix of yoghurt, puffed rice, sugar, jaggery and Tilkut. The morning breakfast is an important ritual for people across Ranchi and has been of great significance since times immemorial.""Dahi chura is a significant part of the Makar Sankranti celebrations.

Express Photo By Pavan Khengre,India on Friday made its first pitch to export about 1.5 million tonnes of Indian sugar to China in a bid to reduce surplus stocks, weeks after an informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan.About 50 officials of the 25 Chinese sugar companies attended a close door interaction with top officials of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) to discuss the possibility to import about one million or 1.5 million tonnes of Indian sugar, which could fetch about USD 350 million.India has 7 million tonnes of surplus sugar this year and with forecast of good rains the surplus stocks were expected to pileup further next year, Gaurav Goel, President of ISMA, told the media after his delegations talks with Chinese officials.While most of the sugar produced in India is consumed at home, India so far has restricted sugar exports to East Africa and Sri Lanka.With the surplus stocks, India is now looking to export to China. China imports about 4.5 million tonnes of surplus stocks mostly from Brazil, Thailand and Cuba, Abinash Verma MD, CEO of Indian Sugar Exim Corporation said.This is the first-time India is making a strong bid to export to China though India has exported about two lakh tonnes in 2007, he said.Besides East Africa and Sri Lanka, India is making a strong pitch for export of sugar to China and Bangladesh to cut losses due to surplus sugar stocks, he said.Fridays meeting took place following the informal summit during which Prime Minister Modi had urged Xi to import Indian sugar, rice and pharmaceuticals, official sources here said.Modi was expected to have follow up discussions during his visit to Chinese city Qingdao to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to be held on June 9 and 10, Verma said.Fridays meeting was organised by the Indian Embassy here.Speaking at the meeting, Counsellor Economic of Indian Embassy, Prashant Lokhande elaborated on the growing economic engagement between India and China and assured Chinese firms that India would emerge as a major sugar trading partner for China with consistent policies and quality product.ISMA officials said India hopes to export its sugars to China under the 50 per cent tariff category, though details are yet to be worked out. China charges 80 per cent tariffs on sugar imports.The response from the Chinese officials for Indias offer of exports is extremely positive, Goel said.There were also inquiries whether the Indian firms could supply and match the quality, he said, adding that an invitation has been extended for the Chinese officials to visit Indian mills which have the most modern facilities.Those who attended the meeting included officials from China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, (CCPIT), China Sugar Association (CSA) and COFCO.The ISMA officials also called on Indian Ambassador, Gautam Bambawale, who informed them that exports of sugar was discussed during Modi-Xi meeting. He offered the embassys full support to push Indian sugar exports to China.Earlier, India has made strong bid to export Soybean and rice to China to address the trade imbalance between the two countries which now amounted to USD 51 billion in over USD 80 billion trade last year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo Service) The Indian Express Deputy Editor Seema Chishti and Assistant Editor Sowmiya Ashok in conversation with herpetologist Romulus Whitaker during the Express Adda in Delhi last wee. (Express Photo Service)This edition of Express Adda in Delhi hosted wildlife conservationist and herpetologist Romulus Whitaker. In a discussion moderated by The Indian Express Deputy Editor Seema Chishti and Assistant Editor Sowmiya Ashok, Whitaker spoke on the myths around snakes, setting up a venom cooperative with the Irulas and the importance of zoos.On being a herpetologistThe snakes, the crocodiles  Ive been in love with them all my life. I owe it very much to my dear departed mother who, when I was four and brought a snake home, didnt say, Get it out of here!. Instead, she said, How beautiful, shall we keep it?. What a way to start. And that was it. For the rest of my life, I just became a snake nut. When we moved to India, in 1951, however, she began to think differently since we were moving to the land of cobras. She was worried about how her little kid would react to the snakes or how the snakes would react to him. Anyway, it all worked out and Im still alive. I have noticed that most kids are very interested in little things that creep and crawl, and most parents are not interested in having them interested. Every step of my career was ordained by fate. For example, when I was in school, I brought a pit viper to the biology class and carried it safely in a nice big, glass jar and the biology teacher said, Wow, what a beautiful snake! Lets put it on display and keep it in the lab for a while. So, theres been a lot of encouragement all along.READ | Snakes not after us, they are frightened of us: Romulus Whitaker at Express AddaOn his Mumbai days and making filmsThat was a very interesting time too. Hobnobbing with the likes of Vyjayanthimala and Dev Anand. (Whitakers stepfather set up the first colour processing lab in Bombay). I was nine or ten years old. It was all lost on me, quite honestly. When I talk about it now, people are like, really, youve met them? We were sitting there watching the rushes of their latest films and it sort of moved something very deep inside me, that reaching out to people through film is really the way to go. We set up the Snake Park in Madras and a million people came there the first year, but every film we have made has been seen by tens of millions of people.Whitaker signed copies of his book, Snakes of India, after the event Whitaker signed copies of his book, Snakes of India, after the eventOn the Madras of the SeventiesMadras was a cool, quiet place in the 70s. A good place to start out for what I wanted to do. First of all, to set up a snake park over there was kind of a wild idea. What was incredible was that the chief conservator at the time visited our little snake park, which is way outside the city in Tambaram. He said, It is way out, nobody is going to come here and what if we give you a piece of land in the Guindy Deer Park? So, the Madras Snake Park was born. It was amazing, considering that I still had my American citizenship.On snakes, the underdogs of the animal worldPeople are pretty derogatory about snakes. It has always been the underdog in the animal world that attracted me. I became very fascinated with bats and toads and things that people usually dont cuddle. I was always a bit against domestic animals  cats and dogs. Lately, my wife has been able to convince me that dogs are very lovable and we do love the dogs we have at home. But I still am for the wild animal.It was a packed hall at The Claridges, New Delhi, for the Express Adda It was a packed hall at The Claridges, New Delhi, for the Express AddaOn conservation and tolerance among rural IndiansIn India, weve got a level of tolerance among rural Indians that is beyond belief. Nowhere in the world is a country where all its major predators are still existing. We should take that as our big lesson and make sure people continue to feel that way.On educating people about snakesMost importantly, if we didnt have snakes, we would be overrun by rats. They are the snakes favourite food. On the other hand, its difficult to get people to learn how to avoid snakes and getting bitten. Especially in a country where we have 50,000 people dying of snake bites every year and many more getting permanently injured by snakes; its avoidable. But getting these messages out there, especially to rural India, is not easy. We are a country steeped in misbeliefs, so it gets a little awkward to say that what your grandfather told you is a lie. One has to do it in a much more diplomatic way and get it across to people that snakes are not after us. Snakes are, in fact, very frightened of us. We have invited them home because we have invited rats home. The amount of garbage we hand around and the crops we grow are perfect for rodents as well. People often say, Dont go into the forest, its very dangerous. There are a lot of snakes there. Just the opposite is true. Its dont go into the rice fields, thats where the snakes are. Another problem is that a lot of people are bitten while they are sleeping on the ground in their huts in villages by a particular species of snakes called the crate. A simple thing like a mosquito net could prevent that. So, there are simple solutions to these very, very severe problems but getting the word out is our biggest challenge right now.Whitaker was presented with a portrait of him made by CR Sasikumar, Chief Illustrator, The Indian Express Whitaker was presented with a portrait of him made by CR Sasikumar, Chief Illustrator, The Indian ExpressOn losing a python and other adventuresI was staying in an apartment on Marine Drive in Bombay, and one day I looked in the box and it was gone. So, I had to go to every flat in the building, knock on the door and say, My pet is missing. I was wondering if youd seen it. And everyone would be thinking of a pussycat or a puppy and would ask, What is your pet? And Id say, Its a python. Not a very big one. Its a smallish python, about eight-feet-long. You can imagine the reaction of people. Eventually we did find the python, named Samson, in our store room. A similar sort of thing happened on a train journey when I was coming back from Kodaikanal to Bombay with my sister. I was on one of the upper berths and so was my sister. She reached across and woke me up and pointed to my sand boa who had gotten out of the bag. Luckily, no one else was awake. I quickly jumped down and put it back in the bag.(Right) SL Kapur, President, Yes Foundation, with son Sandeep Kapur, Managing Director, Sugam Electronics (Right) SL Kapur, President, Yes Foundation, with son Sandeep Kapur, Managing Director, Sugam ElectronicsOn the state of zoos in IndiaTo get into a discussion about zoos would be a little awkward right now. We operate one of the largest zoos in the country, which is the Madras Crocodile Bank with 2,500 animals there and we try and look after them the best we can. I know that some zoos are much better than others and some really dont make the mark. One of the sad things that has happened recently is that we can no longer allow a child to touch a snake. I can understand why this ruling came about because people would mishandle snakes or even a baby crocodile. But if a child gets to touch a snake along with a good explanation and gets to see that it is dry, clean and wonderful to the touch, it opens up a whole new world of excitement to the child. And zoos do perform that wonderful function for millions of city people in particular, who never really get an opportunity to see an animal up close.Author Pranay Lal with wife, Vandana Singh, writer and policy advisor, daughter Aria and son Avie Author Pranay Lal with wife, Vandana Singh, writer and policy advisor, daughter Aria and son AvieOn whether the focus on tigers left out other speciesWere all in competition with each other for the support of people for different species. As far as the gharial is concerned, it kind of epitomises clean rivers. The so-called unholy river of Chambal is one of the cleanest large rivers we have in the country. It is a fantastic irony that our holy rivers, the Ganga and the Yamuna, are among the filthiest in the world. The gharial cant live very well there anymore. There are a few coming back, thanks to the help from the World Wildlife Fund and a lot of very dedicated people in the Wildlife Institute of India. Chambal is really the last safe repository for the gharial. Another irony is that we have been so successful that crocodiles are literally bouncing back. Where crocodile numbers are increasing, attacks are increasing as well, and now we have to educate people about how to live with crocodiles; not how to conserve them.(From left) Pediatrician Yogesh Parashar, son Rahul, a student, and Gajinder Bains, Vice-President, Napino Control Systems Express Photo Service (From left) Pediatrician Yogesh Parashar, son Rahul, a student, and Gajinder Bains, Vice-President, Napino Control Systems Express Photo ServiceOn working with the snake-catching Irula tribeI met the Irulas in the late 60s. I maintain to this day that they are the best snake hunters in the world. Theyll see a small track on the ground and theyll tell you what species it is, when it went this way, where it is now. They were, in those days, hunting for skins and catching millions of snakes for skins. We exported up to 10 million snake skins a year till the Wildlife Protection Act came into being. When that came into effect, they didnt have a job. The Irulas are not farmers, they are hunter-gatherers. So, there was really not much for them to do. We hatched an idea together, of starting a venom cooperative. We registered a venom society in 1978. They now catch snakes  8,000-10,000 a year  and bring them to the Irula co-operative, extract venom two or three times and then release the snakes into the wild. This venom is used to make life-saving anti-venom, which is the only antidote available for a snake bite. I am not sure they (Irulas) understand that they are literally saving millions of lives.On the environmental crisisI will look at it in the context of what it was 20 years ago. In terms of awareness and social media, things are looking better than before. At the same time, we have a population that keeps growing. And we have development strategies in India that are pretty disastrous, so there is certainly no complacency. We need to keep at it, but things are certainly looking better than they did.VOICE BANKKrishna Pophale Krishna PophaleKrishna Pophale, ConsultantCan we do away with restrictive rules and allow people to touch animals, on the model of South Africa?A certain standard has to be set and followed. The reason that this rule came about was because of the mishandling of animals. So how we frame the rules, and make sure that they are enforced so that people do not mishandle animals, is probably the big argument. But it would be wonderful if we could  I very strongly believe that just that touch of a snake opens peoples minds and changes it forever.Aria Lal Aria LalAria Lal, Student, the Sriram Millennium SchoolYesterday, a lizard entered our class, there was a lot of chaos and some boys tried to smash it. I do not know what we need to do to make people aware that they also have right to live.Yes, especially as they are not dangerous, so whats the harm?I know a lot of people are afraid of house geckos. Not scared of them necessarily, but they abhor them. And this is the same creature that is eating all the mosquitoes and cockroaches that you dont want around your house. Like I said about snake bites and education, we really need to make people aware, and get them to understand and appreciate things like lizards.Debjani Sengupta Debjani SenguptaDebjani Sengupta: Associate Professor, Delhi UniversityMost of the time when we talk about conservation, its a top-down kind of thing, without the active participation of people. What is your take on this?To me, the wild animals are just so interesting that they are an endless source of enjoyment and pleasure Human beings are also very interesting.Ishaan Kumar Ishaan KumarIshaan Kumar: Animator/Graphic DesignerApart from human behaviour, global warming is playing a huge role in changing habitats, species and their behaviour. Have you had to adapt to the changes in environment?We havent had to do it at the moment. There are people thinking about it very deeply. I do not know if you are aware, but among reptiles, turtles and crocodiles, sex is determined by the incubation temperature of the egg. That is an amazing fact  most people think it is genetic as it is with mammals and birds. But in the case of reptiles, it is simply temperature. This means as global warming takes over our planet, drastic changes are going to happen. Certain species of crocodiles might go extinct unless humans intervene.Sourajit Ghosal Sourajit GhosalSourajit Ghosal: Advertising professionalHow are snakes doing in India? What are their numbers like? Are they getting the conservation they require?Ever since the snake-skin industry was stopped, it was a great fillip for snakes. Since then, a lot of development is anti-snakes and anti-wildlife in general. But snakes are doing well. There is an awareness about reptiles and snakes. For me, its a very positive trend. There are some species in parts of the Western Ghats, where because of the dam projects coming up and pieces of forests being destroyed, we might have extinction happening. But, by and large, snakes are doing pretty well in India.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Ashok Sinha) Asha Devi, 40, is happy that her husband has stopped beating her. (Ashok Sinha)OVER THE last two months, a survey conducted by jail officials across Bihar showed that the share of its weakest sections, especially SC and ST, among those arrested under prohibition far outstripped their share in the states population. Yet, there is a reason why the government continues to flaunt prohibition as a landmark achievement.It can be seen on the faces of women in hundreds of villages across the state, like Manjhiyama in Arwal district, where the alcohol ban has meant more money in households, new houses and a better life.READ | Widows and elderly jailed, children picked up for ferrying liquorI dont get beaten up by my husband now. Whatever he earns, he gives it to me. Whatever people may say, Nitish Kumar has done a very good thing by banning liquor, says Asha Devi, 40, in Manjhiyama, around 100 km southwest of Patna.When The Indian Express met Asha, she was preparing to serve lunch  rice and besan curry  to her husband Sanjeev Sah, and their two young daughters and a son. Such family moments, she says, were rare when Sanjeev, a tractor driver, used to spend most of his spare time and money on alcohol.I earn Rs 7,000 per month and earlier, on most days, I would head to the liquor shop at the first opportunity. Now, I head directly back home, says Sah with a sheepish smile.In Manjhiyama, with a population of around 5,500, the most visible signs of progress post-prohibition are the rows of 20 new pucca houses, including five each in the EBC and SC settlements. With the money that villagers have saved, we have seen a boost in household income. For example, around 700 litres of milk used to be sold from this village every day before prohibition. Now, the sale is around 1,000 litres with at least 25 per cent more people having started maintaining cows, said Umesh Sharma, who owns six Jersey varieties and counts himself among those who have benefitted from prohibition.This was the same village that saw almost 40 per cent of its men, aged between 20 and 50, line up at the liquor shop in the evenings. The shop would remain open from morning till midnight, says a local official.

We had 26 focused group discussions with 1,001 women, 20 focused group discussions with 242 women and 10 discussions with 647 adolescent girls, spread across all geographical areas. We concluded that a major impact of prohibition was a substantial reduction in domestic violence cases, from 54 per cent to five per cent. The case of verbal abuse against children by fathers and relatives also came down from 35 per cent to five per cent, says Anand Madhab, principal consultant, GRC.The report states: Consumption of food and non-food items has gone up by over 30 per cent. Money that is getting saved from liquor is being spent on buying green vegetables, milk, fish, meat, hiring private tuitions, better clothes and even snacks for children.In Manjhiyama, prohibition has had an unexpected fallout, too.Says Nityanand Kumar, who used to earn Rs 5,000 by renting a portion of his house for the liquor shop: I have now bought two cows to make up for the loss.Tomorrow: Politics of prohibitionFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

From irregularities in rice trade to charging rates above the MRP, we could effectively carry out inspections to ensure the rights of the public during this period, said R. Ram Mohan, Deputy Controller (central zone) of the Legal Metrology Department.The jurisdiction of the central zone includes Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Idukki. Eleven cases were registered for violation of rules by rice traders for smudging the MRP of their products while 16 cases were registered against car dealers for irregularities related to after-sale service of premium cars. Inspections revealed that they were collecting excess rates for the spare parts. New MRP tags were found on old stocks of spare parts, said Mr. Ram Mohan.The team registered 25 cases against vendors of vegetables, fruits and meat for short delivery of commodities and various weight-related manipulations. Mr. Ram Mohan said that the inspections were part of State-wide checks on vendors following complaints that chicken, fruits and vegetables were sold at inflated rates in the name of Goods and Services Tax. Leading hospitals came under the scanner of the department after inspections found that the managements were using uncalibrated weighing machines in diagnostic services. As per norms, the weighing machines have to be calibrated once a year.The department ordered the closure of 15 erratic fuel nozzles following raids launched based on reports that dealers were cheating customers by installing electronic chips in dispensing machines and pre-calibrating for 5 per cent to 10 per cent deduction in the fuel dispensed."

(Express Photo by Deepak Daware) Farmers sell their harvest at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi at Amravati, Maharashtra. (Express Photo by Deepak Daware)When in mid-December, Anand Pawar decided to register the standing tur (pigeon-pea) on 10 out of his 50-acre holding with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federations purchase centre at Latur, he was quite hopeful of realising the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,450 per quintal for the soon-to-be-harvested crop. At the time of registration, this farmer from Harangul Khurd village of Latur taluka was even promised he would soon receive an SMS, specifying the date and time for him to proceed to make the sale at the centre.The SMS never came and, more than five months later, Pawar is still stuck with the 65 quintals of tur he harvested in mid-January. And he deeply regrets not having sold his crop then at the prevailing market rate of Rs 4,200-4,250 per quintal. Tur is currently trading in the Latur market yard at Rs 3,550-3,600 per quintal. Why promise something you did not intend to deliver? What option do I have other than sell at todays going price? I need the money for my next crop, with the monsoon rains just 2-3 weeks away, says Pawar, whose sole consolation is from the soyabean on his balance 40 acres. While it also sold initially below the MSP of Rs 3,050 per quintal  at Rs 2,550-2,600 in November and Rs 2,800-2,900 in December  prices rose significantly thereafter. Pawar could fetch Rs 3,800-3,900 per quintal for his last lot of soyabean sold in early-April.Pawar is a relatively better-off farmer, who was able to make some money by not selling his entire soyabean crop during the peak marketing season of November-December. But 2017-18 has been an unmitigated disaster even for him, when it comes to pulses. For growers of tur, urad (black gram), moong (green gram), chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil), this is a year they would simply not want to remember.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?The curse of low realisations for farmers  ironically, in a crop where India has been perpetually import-dependent  comes despite government agencies undertaking record procurement during the last two years. In the 2015-16 crop year (July-June), a mere 1.19 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses were procured under the Price Stabilisation Fund set up by the Narendra Modi government: 50,422.53 tonnes during kharif and 69,049.08 tonnes in the rabi marketing season. In 2016-17, procurement by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium rose over 13 times to 15.62 lt. That included 14.74 lt of kharif pulses (11.66 lt tur, 2.20 lt moong and 0.89 lt urad) and 0.87 lt of rabi pulses (0.60 lt chana and 0.27 lt masur).In the current year, procurement, which is ongoing, is set to further double. NAFED, the only government agency now procuring under the so-called Price Support Scheme (PSS), has till now bought 14.59 lt of chana, 8.58 lt of tur, 2.95 lt of moong, 2.03 lt of urad and 1.36 lt of masoor. That adds up to around 29.50 lt. The final figure could well cross 30 lt  unprecedented as far as pulses go.But unlike for wheat and paddy  for which there are established systems that have stood the test of time  the actual process of procurement has been far from smooth in the case of pulses. Under PSS, the MSP-based procurement is done by state marketing federations that are sub-agents of NAFED. In states such as Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, farmers wanting to sell are required to register themselves first at the procurement centres of their areas. As part of this process, they have to mention the area planted under a particular crop, while providing proof of land ownership (copy of 7/12 revenue extract) and also their Aadhaar identification and bank account numbers. Once registration happens, the farmers are supposed to get an SMS intimation of the date for bringing their produce, the idea being to avoid overcrowding at the procurement centres. Payments, too, are to be credited directly into their bank accounts within 48 hours of the sale taking place.However, things havent quite worked that way on the ground.ALSO READ | Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous statesIn MP, farmers have had to wait in long queues at the mandis for selling their chana and masur at the governments MSPs. There have even been reports of a couple of farmers dying after standing for hours in the searing summer heat. The situation has been rendered worse by the shortage of weighing machines and porters, especially in the smaller mandis. Notwithstanding all this, government agencies, as on May 22, had managed to procure 9.10 lt of chana from MP (worth Rs 4,003.96 crore at the MSP of Rs 4,400 per quintal) and another 2.67 lt (Rs 1,174.99 crore) from Rajasthan. The agencies also bought 1.34 lt of masur from MP, whose MSP value was Rs 571.23 crore. Both MP and Rajasthan are, incidentally, headed for state assembly polls in November-December this year.In Maharashtra, many farmers registered their crop at government purchase centres, but could not sell a single quintal at the MSP. Pawar sought to sell, apart from his 65 quintals of tur, also 25 quintals of chana grown on five acres this rabi season. I went to the centre on Monday to make a final enquiry on whether at least my chana would be procured. But the officials could not give any definite date. How does this government really expect our incomes to double?, he asks sarcastically.Government agencies procured 4.01 lt of tur from Maharashtra is the 2016-17 kharif marketing season. This time, they purchased another 3.25 lt, worth Rs 1,770.84 crore at the MSP, but farmers havent received even half of this amount so far (when they were supposed to get paid within 48 hours). The reason for it is that the procured produce has not been moved from the centres to the designated godowns. NAFED will not realise the payments without that. But the produce cannot be moved, as there is no space in the godowns, which are full with the unsold tur and chana of last year, admits a Maharashtra government official.With the new planting season about to start, NAFED is desperately issuing tenders for offloading its inventories. Total unsold stocks of pulses in government godowns, from two years of record procurement, are estimated at more than 40 lt. These stocks  on top of continuing imports  will exert further pressure on prices when the next crop arrives from September. The only thing that can prevent such an eventuality is drought. That, again, isnt going to help farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Express Pulses growth could mean India may have to import less by 2030. ExpressTill recently, there were two agri-commodities in which India was seen as being perpetually and increasingly import-dependent: edible oils and pulses. Between 2010-11 and 2016-17, the import value of the former soared from $4.72 billion to $10.89 billion, while from $2.25 billion to $4.24 billion in the case of the latter. During the fiscal ended March 2018, imports of edible oil rose further to $11.64 billion.But now, there are signs of change at least with regard to pulses. The reason isnt because of the value of imports falling to $2.91 billion in 2017-18, but domestic production finally coming into its own.The last two years, as the accompanying table shows, have registered a substantial jump in the countrys pulses output to 23-24 million tonnes (mt). True, that looks huge compared to the 16-17 mt levels of the preceding two years, which, however, saw drought conditions in major pulses-growing areas. But even relative to the normal average of 18 mt in recent times, we are talking of a roughly one-third production increase, which isnt small at all.ALSO READ | Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous statesIf 23-24 mt is, indeed, the new normal for domestic pulses output, it has significant implications.In a just-published paper (Changing Consumption Patterns and Roles of Pulses in Nutrition, and Future Demand Projections) for the International Food Policy Research Institute at Washington, three economists  Praduman Kumar, P K Joshi and Shinoj Parappurathu  have estimated the likely demand for pulses in India till 2030. They have projected the total domestic pulses demand under three different income growth scenarios: at current GDP growth rates, the demand is expected to go up from 18.02 mt in 2010 to 21.87 mt in 2020 and 26.58 mt by 2030. If GDP growth is low (25% below existing rates), the demand would rise to only 21.40 mt in 2020 and 25.22 mt in 2030. The corresponding numbers in a high growth scenario (25% above current rates) are 22.36 mt and 28.07 mt, respectively.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThere are two important things to note here. The first is that the 23-24 mt pulses production achieved by India in the last two years already exceeds the 22.36 mt demand projected in the Washington-based institutes study. Secondly, even if output were not to rise further over the next decade, the country will not have to import more than four mt annually in 2030.If production increases the way it has in the last two years, India, far from being an importer, may even end up being a net exporter of pulses. This is a scenario no one imagined  till quite recently.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b14bce69855b75cf6a85199,Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous states,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/breeding-challenges-hybrid-rice-clicks-better-in-poor-than-agriculturally-prosperous-states-5197795/,2018-05-31,"In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mh In India, hybrid variants are cultivated in 3 million hectares, out of the total 44 mhThe poorer a state, the less are the chances of its farmers adopting high-yielding seed technology, right? Well, not when it comes to hybrid rice at least.Out of the countrys total estimated area of 65.8 lakh acres (26.6 lakh hectares) under hybrid paddy  the un-milled grain containing roughly two-thirds rice and one-third husk and bran  nearly 83% is accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. These are states, whose farmers arent as well-off as their counterparts in Northwestern and Southern India, and crop yields well below even that of West Bengal (Indias No. 1 rice producer).What accounts for this seeming paradox  of relatively poorer farmers taking to planting of hybrids, as opposed to conventional open-pollinated varieties (OPV)?Hybrids are produced by crossing genetically diverse plants even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either of the parents (both OPVs) individually can give. Unlike OPVs, though, the grains from hybrids arent suited for saving and re-use as seed by farmers. The resultant plants will not have the same hybrid vigour as the F1 offspring. Farmers will, hence, plant hybrid seeds  which, have to be purchased each time  only if the grain yields from them are substantially higher over OPVs.In the not-so-prosperous belts of eastern and central India, paddy yields from OPVs average 15 quintals per acre, whereas, with hybrids, farmers can harvest 25 quintals, notes Ajeet Chahal, Head of Seeds Marketing (South Asia) at Bayer AG.The German multinational has a 35% share in the Indian market for hybrid paddy seeds, which, at 38,000 tonnes and an average maximum retail price of Rs 250-300/kg, is annually worth around Rs 1,000 crore. Besides Bayer, the other significant players in this market include DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Tata-Metahelix, Kaveri Seeds and VNR Seeds.ALSO READ | A new problem of plenty: Government godowns are, for the first time, bursting at the seams with pulses on record procurementThe seed requirement in hybrid paddy is low  about 6 kg per acre, as against 20-30 kg for OPVs  but yields are higher because the plants produce more tillers (stems). The better tillering ability means farmers need to transplant only one hybrid seedling per rice hill, while it is 2-3 in OPVs. At Rs 355/kg  the MRP for Arize 6444 Gold, Bayers best-selling hybrid that covers some 20 lakh acres in India  the cost of 6 kg seed comes to Rs 2,130 per acre. But given the extra 10 quintals yield  whose value, at the governments minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal, works out to Rs 15,500  it may be worthwhile for farmers in Jharkhand or Odisha to spend that money before every planting season.An Indian Express from Nabarangpur in Odisha showed how this district (which happens to be Indias poorest, with a predominantly adivasi ) alone has a hybrid paddy seeds market of 600-650 tonnes, covering over one lakh of its total 2.5 lakh acres area (goo.gl/sEhQcs).Chahal, however, admits that there is not all that much of a yield advantage from hybrids in the traditional Green Revolution regions, where farmers follow high-management agronomic practices with assured irrigation facilities. In Punjab and Haryana, you get 30 quintals-plus yield per acre from even OPVs. Hybrid paddy may give 10% more, but farmers will switch only if yields are 40 quintals, not 33 quintals, he points out.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?India has hardly three million hectares (mh) out of its total rice area of 44 mh under hybrids, while the corresponding numbers for China are 18 mh and 30 mh respectively. Chinas average paddy yields, at 6.75 tonnes per hectare (27.3 quintals/acre), are way above Indias 3.6 tonnes (14.6 quintals) and its farmers also typically harvest 10 tonnes per hectare (40 quintals/acre) from hybrids.The Chinese mostly produce medium-bold coarse grain (with length-to-breadth or LB ratio below 3), which is liked by consumers there and also more amenable to higher yields. In India, the preferences vary from short-slender rice (fine grain below 5 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the South and medium-slender (slightly coarse grain below 6 mm length and LB ratio above 3) in the East, to long-slender (6-7 mm length and LB ratio above 3) and extra-long slender (fine basmati-type grain more than 7 mm long and LB ratio above 3) in the North. There are also varieties such as Parmal, which are in between medium-slender and long-slender. Such diverse requirements across geographies makes hybrid breeding a real challenge, explains Chahal.A.K. Singh, the head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) Division of Genetics, identifies grain quality as a major cause for the low rate of hybrid paddy adoption. The hybrids bred initially had poor milling quality, with low head rice recovery and high percentage of broken grains. The newer generation of hybrids are far superior, yet the perception among millers, of the grain quality not meeting the standards for government procurement, remains, he says.IARI, in 2001, had released Pusa RH-10, the worlds first-ever basmati-quality aromatic hybrid rice. With a paddy yield of 7 tonnes per hectare and maturing in 110-115 days from seed to grain, it outperformed then blockbuster Pusa Basmati-1 variety that produced 6 tonnes over 135-140 days. However, this hybrid lost out to two basmati OPVs that IARI subsequently released: Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509. Although they yielded between 5 and 6 tonnes per hectare, the milled rice from these varieties had an average grain length of 20 mm on cooking, as compared to 15 mm for Pusa RH-10, adds Singh.The future of hybrid rice in India lies in breeding not just for yields, but also for quality, regional preferences, and pest and disease resistance. Last year, we launched Arize AZ 8433 DT, a hybrid with strong tolerance to both brown planthopper insect pest and bacterial leaf blight disease attacks. In this kharif season, we are introducing AZ 6633, a hybrid in the short-slender fine grain segment for South India. Besides, we have bred a short-duration Parmal-quality hybrid AZ 6508, yielding 30-32 quintals per acre over 115 days. Farmers in Haryana can harvest this by mid-September and then sow potato in October, claims Chahal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Satyanarayana, an agriculture scientist, has admitted to discrepancies in his affidavits on gross irrigation requirement, crop duration and other aspects of paddy cultivation in the Krishna Basin areas of AP.Following his intensive probing on the aspect of crop duration in the Krishna Basin areas by senior counsel for Telangana C.S. Vaidyanathan, Mr. Satyanarayana, who is the Director of AP Rice Research Institute, submitted to the tribunal in New Delhi on Wednesday that he would verify and furnish different documents.Fresh worksheetsHe also told the tribunal that he would submit fresh worksheets on crop water requirement on Thursday.A senior irrigation engineer of Telangana who was present at the hearing told The Hindu over phone that the APs witness had to admit to the false information provided by him in three affidavits and worksheets submitted on September 7, 2017, January 22, 2018 and February 19, 2018 as his argument and documentary evidence were in contradiction.After repeated questions on the study undertaken by him to ascertain the actual field conditions prevailing in the areas, as mentioned in his affidavit, the APs witness admitted before the tribunal that he did not visit the command areas of Nagarjunasagar Right and Left Canals personally after July 2017, when he was asked to depose before the tribunal as a witness for the AP government.He stated that he had prepared his study report based on his past experience as an agriculture scientist and the relevant records of latest (2017-18) vyavasaya panchangam (agriculture almanac) prepared and released by AP and not based on the actual field study carried out after July 2017.Rainfall dependentAfter stating that he had personally seen standing paddy crop in Eluru, Vijayawada, Gudiwada, Pamarru, Guntur, Ponnur and Kankipadu after July 2017 and that it was cultivated during June last week and July first week, Mr. Satyanarayana said the cultivation was done with rainfall and water was not received either from Prakasam Barrage or Pattiseema project. He, however, did not substantiate his claim on the rainfall during the period.Verify factsFurther, the APs witness said he would verify when asked whether water was released from Nagarjunasagar during June-October period in 2017.Mr. Satyanarayana did not explain the discrepancy, when asked whether the irrigation engineers of combined AP, who stated in the modernisation report that the crop growing period in Krishna Delta System was 112 days to 122 days, wilfully prepared a false report since he (the APs witness) had stated that the crop duration was long from 145 days to 150 days."

Sources said ground water department had collected data to show that there was a very fast depletion of water in bore wells after the 24-hour power supply started in January.Big farmersThe exploitation of bore wells by big farmers who cultivated higher acreage of crop had dried up nearby wells of smaller ones.There are about 22 lakh bore wells in Telangana which are the sources of major area of paddy cultivation in rabi. The crop is cultivated over 17.5 lakh acres in the season across the State.Sources also said the crop suffered from brown plant hopper and blast pests but the government lacked a programme to tackle them.Pest attackIt promoted fine varieties of rice susceptible to pests and diseases. Even tolerant varieties like MTU 1010 were exposed to pest attack.Fine varieties were encouraged by government on public demand for reasons of taste though they did not contribute to nutrition. The emphasis was on usage of chemicals which damaged environment. The recent hailstorm posed further danger to paddy yield."

Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.A day before Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Odisha, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday accused the BJP of shedding crocodile tears on the Mahanadi water dispute while addressing a massive public meeting on Mahanadi Suraksha, organised by the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Jagatsinghpur district.Thanking the people for supporting the BJDs Jansachetana Yatra (public awareness campaign) on shortage of water in the Mahanadi, Patnaik said that the political movement on the water dispute has now turned into a peoples movement.The silence of the BJP government at the Centre is sad. BJP leaders from Odisha support Chhattisgarh, yet shed crocodile tears (for Odisha), he said.Odisha is opposing construction on upstream Mahanadi by the BJP government in Chhattisgarh, claiming that the projects are disrupting flow of water in the river. The BJPs stand is that the BJD should approach the Mahanadi Water Disputes Tribunal if it has any grievances and should not politicise the issue.Patnaik said the BJD is not just fighting for water but for life of the Mahanadi. He said, Crores of Odiya people depend on the river for their livelihood. We will respond to this attack on their lives.The BJP, expected to be the BJDs main opponent in next years state elections, hit back at Patnaik. Calling the chief minister double-faced, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said, He is the chief minister and also the party (BJD) supremo. As CM, he had declared in the Assembly in December that Odisha was receiving its fair share of water, and in fact (was) unable to conserve 53 per cent of Mahanadi water that drains into the sea.But, Patra said, now, as party supremo, he says the problem needs a solution and Modi is not thinking about it. Is this not double-faced?The BJD had launched the Jansachetana Yatra on May 16, with Jharsuguda and Bargarh districts, two points where the Mahanadi enters Odisha from Chhattisgarh, as key focus areas. The yatra has already covered 15 riparian districts, including Sambalpur, Subarnapur, Boudh, Angul, Dhenkanal, Nayagarh, Cuttack, Khordha, Jajpur, Kendrapara and Puri.According to a senior BJD leader, This yatra has passed through 47 Assembly constituencies.

(Express Photo) At one such tuition class in Kongappadam village. (Express Photo)In the 1990s, when C D Sajith Kumar, a student of NSS Engineering College in Palakkad, Kerala, lived in a rented house near a Dalit colony in Kongappadam village, he realised not one person from there went to college. In 2013, now a mechanical engineer in Qatar, Kumar returned to Palakkad for an alumni meet, and was struck by how little had changed  most children still dropped out after Class X.Despite the college being a mere half kilometre away, most youngsters didnt finish school. They toiled in nearby farms or did odd jobs in Palakkad town, says Kumar (46).Thats when he decided to step in. In 2013-14, Kumar launched a free educational empowerment programme, called Ente Kongappadam (my Kongappadam), giving tuitions to children from the colony who were in Classes VIII, IX and X. He roped in students from NSS Engineering College to volunteer as teachers and started morning and evening classes at an anganwadi in the colony.The project has so far helped 38 students pursue education beyond Class X. For a colony that had no graduates, there are now three who are in undergraduation courses and two who are set to join this year. Besides, there are students pursing diploma courses. Since the project began, says Kumar, only one student from the colony has failed Class 10.Kongappadam, which is part of the Akathethara village panchayat, has 174 Dalits from the Cheruma Scheduled Caste community. Men and women work as daily labourers, and no one holds a government job.I spoke to the parents and convinced them that it was important for their children to study because besides being eligible for jobs, it was the only way they could fight social isolation, says Kumar, adding that education the road to joining the mainstream. All these government schemes of giving Dalits free supply of rice and other provisions should stop. Instead, their social disconnect for want of education should be addressed effectively.Besides motivating students from NSS College to teach the children, Kumar introduced online education through laptops and a television and ensured broadband connectivity. Classes for science, mathematics and English were held at the anganwadi in the morning and evening. Apart from the tuition classes, students were trained in soft skills such as communication. Kumar says he only had to spend Rs 8,000 a month to keep the programme running.Prof P R Suresh of NSS Engineering College, who helped Kumar with the programme, says, To get children in the colony to start dreaming big, we took them on a tour of the college.Until last year, engineering students worked as tuition teachers, but now, we get students from within the colony and teachers living in the area to give classes, he adds.Despite continuing with his job in Qatar, Kumar keeps a close watch on the programme and makes periodic visits.Says K Guruvayoorappan, a resident of the colony, The tuition scheme has helped us realise that only education can improve our lives.Namitha R, 19, one of those who attended the tuition classes, says, Now all the teenagers are keen on continuing their studies. I was the first person from the colony to write the engineering entrance exam. I even got into the rank list, but finally did not opt for engineering. Namitha is now a student of fashion designing in Palakkad.Sini K, 17, who has enrolled for his degree course this year, says the tuitions helped students improve their results. Earlier, we had no culture of studying at home. We would come home from school and help our parents in the fields or sit around doing nothing. Now, we all spend a few hours studying at home.In January this year, Kumar introduced his project at Loka Kerala Sabha, a two-day convention of non-resident Keralites organised by the state government. Subsequently, the programme is set to be replicated in five other Dalit settlements in Kerala, starting from Sasthamkotta village in Kollam in June.The State Planning Board too has taken note. We need more such development models which can be implemented in SC/ST areas. Often, governments invest huge money in projects but these dont do much to improve the living standards of Dalits, says Board member K N Harilal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We plan to brand nearly 40 tonnes of organic rice as Thottara Rice and market it through the existing network of the Agriculture Department. In the next phase, larger quantities of the produce will be taken up for branding, said Sujith Karun, Ernakulam district co-ordinator of the Haritha Keralam Mission. The organisers are hoping to harvest around 1,500 metric tonnes of paddy from Thottara Puncha, which extends to around 1,200 acres at Amballur and Edakkattuvayal in Ernakulam district and Vellur panchayat in Kottayam district. Farmers affiliated to nine Padashekhara Samitis are engaged in paddy cultivation. It is expected that around 300 tonnes of rice can be produced from 1,500 metric tonnes of paddy cultivated in the 550-acre area.The Agriculture Department has the capacity to market nearly 40 tonnes of Thottara brand rice in the first phase. And, farmers can sell the remaining rice to private mills. Mr. Sujith said that the Kudumbasree Mission had agreed to set up a mill at Amballoor. It will also provide Rs. 40 lakh for the realisation of the project.Interestingly, District Collector K. Mohammed Y. Safirulla had taken the lead in bringing the maximum available cultivable land under Thottara Puncha for paddy cultivation. Farming in the barren land began in 2015. Major preparatory works like the cleaning up of 11 km of main canals by the Minor Irrigation Department to de-water the paddy fields, land preparatory work in padashekharams, field survey for installation of 12 submersible pumps, consultations with stakeholders, and field visits to padashekharams were completed as part of the initiative. The district administration had increased the acreage of Thottara Puncha over the last couple of years starting with 150 acres in 2015-16 followed by 350 acres in 2016-17."

Subham Dutta Dibakar Mondal at the hut where he has been hiding since the nomination process began on April 3, along with nine other BJP supporters; (below) the TMC celebrations after the results on May 17. Subham DuttaDIBAKAR Mondal jumps over a 3-ft boundary wall at the back and disappears, within seconds of a car stopping outside a 10X12 ft mud hut in Mainan village in Magrahat 1, South 24 Parganas district, on 9 am, May 17. He returns 15 minutes and several phone calls later. A slender man of 30, dressed in a blue shirt and black trousers, nursing a gun wound in his leg, Dibakar smiles nervously, saying he had mistaken the occupants of the car for people who had been threatening him. I thought they had come, he says, entering the mud hut with cracked patches and a kuchcha roof, and turning on a television set.The old TV, kept on a stool, was arranged by Dibakar recently to track developments since the violence-ridden panchayat poll process began in West Bengal. Dibakar is a candidate of the BJP, which is contesting all the three panchayat samitis in Lakshmikantpur, located 60 km from Kolkata. He was shot in the right leg when he refused to withdraw his nomination, and has been hiding out here since then along with nine others, all BJP supporters. With fields of grains and pulses spread all across and the lush-green growth around them, Mainan appears a picture of serenity. But tension is running high, and like Dibakar, other BJP candidates of this village have taken shelter in mud houses like the one he is occupying. In all, Magrahat 1 block had 11 BJP contestants in the panchayat polls.South 24 Parganas district has 4,884 gram panchayat seats, of which elections were held on 3,058 seats, the remaining having been won uncontested by the TMC. Between April 3, when the nomination process began, and May 14, there were several instances of violence, leaving more than 10 injured. Dibakar was shot on April 5, when he was leading a group of BJP workers to file nominations. Says BJP district president Abhijeet Das, Dibakar was being threatened to withdraw his nomination. When he refused to do so, a group of TMC goons attacked him and he was shot from point blank range.Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384. Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384.Denying this, TMC local leader Subhasish Chakraborty says, Losers always have some excuse or the other. The BJP as a party has no base in South 24 Parganas. As far as Dibakars bullet injury is concerned, it was a fallout of a group fight. They are unnecessarily blaming the TMC. People of Bengal are happy with us and hence they voted (for us). Counting is on today at the Usthi Block Development Office, about 7 km from the hut he is in. But Dibakar says he doesnt dare venture out to check.Bijoy Bayen, 36, who is staying along with Dibakar, says he has picked up cooking since the job of feeding the party mates fell upon him. I had no idea about cooking, but now that we are living like refugees, I have learnt, says Bayen, who adds that he too has been threatened as he is a close aide of Dibakars. Dibakar, meanwhile, keeps switching between news channels, and making phone calls.Around 8 am, TV channels start reporting that some panchayat poll results have come. Quickly, Dibakar turns the set off, and starts reading a Bengali newspaper from among the several lying around.Dibakar explains that he is not too keen to know the results. No one was allowed to vote here after 9 am (on polling day). It was all rigged, counting is just a formality.Shankar Mondal, 29, who has been listening to the conversation, says its too scary to contest on a ticket other than the TMCs in West Bengal. I have been hiding for several days for my survival. I keep moving from one house to another, he says, just before stepping out to relieve himself after tying a handkerchief around his face.Before he has his breakfast around 10 am  usually roti-sabzi  Dibakar offers prayers at the idols of lords Laxmi and Narayan he has placed in a corner. He picks up a party pamphlet lying on the floor, puts some prasad of nakul dana (sweet makhana) on it, and says some mantras. However, this daily puja routine, lasting him around 5 minutes, is disrupted when Dibakar gets a call on his mobile.He answers the phone but keeps silent until he is sure its his family on the other side. They told him once again to stay safe, he says later. Hanging up the phone, Dibakar serves himself breakfast in an aluminum plate. Eating the food, he talks about how great a cook his wife is. Not a day goes by without me eating fish and rice at home, but here we will have chingri maach (prawn) and rice after so many days for lunch today, he says.However, its not safe yet to return home, Dibakar adds. My days start with a call to my family to find out if they are fine and end with sleepless nights.Breakfast done, he again decides to sit in front of the TV to get an update on the panchayat polls. The results of the Lakshmikantpur panchayat samitis come in around 2 pm. All the three seats go to the TMC. Dibakar shows no reaction, saying, None of the opposition parties could station their polling agents in booths on election date. No one was allowed in the vicinity. People didnt come to vote because there was continuous bombing in the area. The TMC took all the seats through rigging.Around noon, Dibakars friend Kali comes with his two-year-old son. As the friends play with him, for a while, tension seems to leave the hut. Meanwhile, the TV is on, updating the count. Of the 3,058 gram panchayat seats on which polls were held, the TMC eventually gets 2,034, the BJP 384. Of the 913 zilla parishad seats, elections were held on 579; 354 go to the TMC and only 15 to the BJP.As the day draws to a close, a stoic Dibakar says, I was threatened, received a bullet injury, but none of the top party leaders visited me. Now that everything is done counting too has been completed we are still running from one place to another to save our lives. Local goons of the ruling party are watching us. We are scared because they can easily outnumber us and attack. However, Dibakar asserts, he wont cow down. I have been in active politics since 2016 and will not leave until the Lok Sabha elections of 2019.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The loss estimates from last Sundays weather havoc were on 35,700 acres.It was painful for farmers watching their paddy kept at various Paddy Purchase Centres (PPCs), getting soaked and washed away. The officials, along with nature, failed us, protesting farmers outside Thipparthy centre cried, demanding that officials purchase affected produce.Aggrieved farmers in Shaligouraram, Chityala, Halia and Chinnasuraram alleged that procurement was nil since it opened on Friday, and tarpaulin covers were not arranged. Officials in the Marketing, and Civil Supplies Department said more protective covers were being bought on Monday. The district with 220 Paddy Purchase Centres (PPCs) for the rabi season, 140 Indira Kranti Patham and 70 Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies, to procure an estimated 5 lakh tonne paddy, has opened only 25 centres till now.Following visits to several PPCs, Joint Collector C. Narayana Reddy assured farmers the wet paddy would be bought by rice mill owners. But to get a minimum support price, Rs. 1,590 for A grade and Rs. 1,550 for normal type, farmers should clean and dry the paddy while ensuring moisture guidelines. Farmers in the affected areas continued to worry, as the weather for the rest of the day was warm, but not hot. Their worst fear is that the heaps of wet paddy would start sprouting."

(Photo by Praveen Khanna/Representational) This will also reduce the requirement of fertiliser by at least eight times. (Photo by Praveen Khanna/Representational)Scientists at the MACS-Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) in Pune have developed a nanofertiliser that can enhance the concentration of zinc in wheat. When the fertiliser is sprayed on the leaves of the crop at the grain filling stage, scientists found that zinc was enriched by 36 per cent using minimum concentration of fertiliser. This will also reduce the requirement of fertiliser by at least eight times.Zinc deficiency is one of the lesser-known health issues, globally. In India, zinc deficiency is also not adequately addressed. Some of the main sources of zinc are green leafy vegetables, mushrooms and chicken. But these are not routinely consumed food sources and therefore, there is inadequate supply of this key micronutrient in the diet of the Indian population.Deficiency of this micronutrient is rampant in pregnant women and children. It is linked to poor development of immune system, higher chances of developing retardation and harmful effects on reproductive health. Studies have also shown a close relation between zinc deficiency and diabetes.Most interventions in improving the nutritive value of the food grain have largely concentrated on improving protein and carbohydrate content through nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilisers, but enhancing micronutrients like zinc is often neglected.At times, when chemical fertilisers are posing a greater threat to soil quality and are growing as a serious health hazard to people, the team from MACS-ARI, led by director KM Paknikar, carried out extensive four-year long field-tests on wheat variety MACS 3125, the institutes indigenously developed variant.This joint project was commissioned by the Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) in 2011. ARI researchers and their counterparts at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) aimed at addressing the zinc insufficiency in the countrys food crops. We wanted to tackle the zinc deficiency so that the gap is filled through regularly consumed staple foods, like wheat. Zinc is among those nutrients that are not just vital for human health but can also address other serious medical conditions, said Paknikar.While fertilisers often overspill the crop and enter the soil ecosystem, adversely affecting its quality and risking chances of wastage, this nanofertiliser, when sprayed, will remain sticking to the leaves of the crop. South Asia leads in zinc deficiency worldwide, with 90 per cent of the population deficient in this nutrient. North America is at 74 per cent, South-East Asia at 72 per cent and Sub-Saharan Africa is at 70 per cent zinc deficiency. Regions where people have adequate zinc in their diet include Europe, US and Canada.In addition to increasing the nutritive value of the wheat grain, researchers also found that concentrations of iron and protein were improving upon using this bio-fortified fertiliser. At the genetic level, the movement of zinc from the applied nanofertiliser is similar to the conventional zinc fertiliser. Since zinc is bound to these genes, the mobilisation of zinc and amino acids along with iron and other proteins within the grain was subsequently observed. This, in turn, adds to the nutritive value of the grain and ultimately, the food that we consume, explained Jyutika Rajwade and Manoj Oak, both ARI researchers.Interestingly, when researchers harvested the wheat grown from their test fields at Baramati, 100 km from Pune, they discovered that neither the taste nor the quality of wheat sprayed with this nanofertiliser was affected. They confirmed that chapati or bread made from flour ground from this wheat matched the taste of all presently consumed wheat variants.We could get wheat grains with better nutritive value without compromising on the crop yield, protein content, spikelets per spike and or any affect on the thousand kernel weight of the wheat crop. Also, in one of our previous studies involving this project, we managed to track the path in which the sprayed fertiliser took, resulting in giving Zn-rich grains, added Paknikar.The team is planning to undertake similar exercises with rice and other staple foods, like jowar and bajra.With this new approach, it will be possible to work on to improve micro-nutrients in other grains and also in other crops, said a senior ARI researcher.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File Photo) The Lt Governor had no authority to block implementation of schemes in rural areas by imposing amusing conditions, Puducherry Chief Minister alleged. (File Photo)Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy today lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Centre for letting down farmers in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry by deliberately delaying the formation of Cauvery Management Board (CMB).The delay by the prime minister and the Centre in constituting the board exposes the NDA governments intention to let down farmers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry dependent on the Cauvery system for irrigation, he told reporters here.He said the Centre was also adopting all means to ensure the CMB was not formed in spite of a clear order from the Supreme Court to set up the board.The Chief Minister charged that the prime minister had time to fly abroad and take up electioneering in poll-bound Karnataka but has no time to concentrate on forming the Board as a solution to address the hardships of farmers in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.Referring to the continued blocking of implementation of vital schemes including free rice scheme by Lt Governor Kiran Bedi, he said the free rice scheme is a programme of the State government and its expenditure is being met by the territorial administration. She later withdrew the order on the free rice scheme after her decision came in for criticism from various quarters.The Lt Governor had no authority to block implementation of schemes in rural areas by imposing amusing conditions, he alleged. He said the territorial government had earmarked Rs 140 crore for implementing the free rice scheme to benefit the poorer sections, members of scheduled castes and backward classes for a period of six months from April this year.Bedi, however, intervened and blocked the implementation of the scheme by imposing a condition that unless the villages were open defecation-free and garbage-free it would be kept on hold, he alleged. He announced that financial assistance of Rs 1,500 would be provided to each student from Puducherry allotted NEET centers outside the Union Territory besides traveling allowance.

Mr. Yeddyurappa, after giving a patient hearing, replied that if his party is voted to power, he would earmark around Rs. one lakh crore for irrigation, ensure 12 hours uninterrupted power supply for irrigation pumpsets and accord priority for construction of a balancing reservoir near Navali.Mr. Yeddyurappa, while holding the Congress government responsible for ignoring the welfare of farmers resulting in 3,750 farm suicides, said that if his party came to power, steps would be taken to withdraw the cases registered against farmers during agitations."

These were some of the recommendations made in the State of Environment Report for Telangana.The draft prepared by the Environmental Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI) and submitted to the government a few months ago also recommends maintaining vegetation, encouraging rooftop gardens and green buildings to check the rising ambient temperature owing to increasing population, growth in concrete structures, air conditioning and vehicular traffic.With summer setting in and as days get hotter and nights warmer, it is pertinent to have another look at the other suggestions made in the report. It calls for raising awareness among households to encourage the use of energy-efficient appliances, promote energy conservation through energy star programme, and introduce alternative and renewable sources of energy.Further, the report suggests the conduct of energy audits to monitor the use of CFL bulbs and lights, besides actively promoting the use of in-situ photovoltaic and solar thermal systems for energy as well as water-heating in public, commercial and private buildings.Solar-powered street lighting and its use in buildings is another aspect to be promoted along with soil and water conservation, says the report. Development of bio-soils for encouraging natural water percolation and for ground water recharge which would also help in reducing urban flooding is another aspect pointed out.It calls for adoption of concentrated solar thermal in industrial heating, cooking and cooling applications, and adoption of waste-to-energy system on a wider scale to reduce fuel requirements in the process of heating. Similar energy-efficiency measures are also necessary in industrial clusters like rice mills, pharma and bulk drugs industry, the report stated.Changing climateIndia ranked as sixth most climate vulnerable country in world in terms of facing extreme weather events - Germanwatch Climate Risk Index 2018.

(Express photo by Harmeet Sodhi) Pawan Kumar Gupta, the national president of the Shiv Sena (Hindustan), moves around with a dozen-odd police personnel. (Express photo by Harmeet Sodhi)A bullet-proof Ambassador given to him by the state government is the latest symbol of power and police protection that Pawan Kumar Gupta, the national president of the Shiv Sena (Hindustan), moves around with a pilot gypsy and a dozen-odd police personnel. Gupta heads one of the Shiv Sena groups in Punjab which now number more than two dozen with new additions taking place every year.The radical Hindu groups of the state are back in news after the clashes with Dalit groups in Phagwara in April in which one youth died and caused tension throughout Punjab. Four persons from Hindu organisations and one from a Dalit organisation have been arrested by the police till now.Visitors to Guptas house at the outskirts of the city are stopped by his gun-toting security guards with a polite question, Koi asla taan nahi hai ji (Are you carrying any firearms).I am the senior most among Shiv Sena leaders in the state having been associated with Balasaheb Thackerays Shiv Sena in Mumbai from 1989 to 2003. Before that I was influenced by Pawan Sharma of Hindu Suraksha Samiti and Jagdish Tangri of Hindu Shiv Sena who had taken on Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale when militancy in Punjab was at its peak, says Gupta.Sitting with two trishuls stacked behind him and sporting a broad tilak, the 48-year-old admits that he was in his teens when he joined the movement. When he is not fighting for the rights of the Hindus in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir, Gupta looks after his business interests as a sleeping partner of a rice sheller.Age factor is a common thread which binds many of these radical group leaders together. Another Patiala-based head of a similar group, Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Suraksha Samiti, Panchanand Giri is also in his late 40s. Apart from the declared aim of protecting Hindu interests, his organisation also runs a langar and gaushala next to the well known Kali Temple in Patiala. We also run the Hindu Takht which is like the Akal Takht of the Sikhs, says Rajesh Kehar, senior vice president of the Samiti, impassively. Panchanand Giri enjoys Y Plus security status and entry to his HQ also entails passing through a security check.The radical leaders admit that what began as a voice of the religious minority in the state against Sikh militant groups in the 1980s has today morphed into an affair where breakaway groups are being formed to seek more importance, and more police security to flaunt. As per our estimate there are 27 Shiv Senas in Punjab, says Kehar with a smile. No one wants to become a worker but everybody wants to become a pradhan, he adds. They all do it for getting security, he says as a matter of fact.Sanjeev Ghanauli, president of Shiv Sena (Punjab) agrees that an obsession for getting security and using it to further alleged illegal activities with impunity as a main cause of mushrooming of Shiv Senas. Today, if you want to demand security, then all you have to do is abuse Bhindranwale on the Facebook and WhatsApp and then go about throwing your weight around. This gives a bad name to us. We feel ashamed, he says. Sharma, who runs a chemist shop in Ghanauli village, near Ropar, is 47 years old and says he joined the movement in 1989 in Shiv Sena (Bal Thackeray). His father was killed by Babbar Khalsa militants in 1992 and since then he has had security personnel allotted to him. At present he has two government vehicles and 15 cops attached with him.Shiv Sena (Lalkar) is the latest group which is raising in the state, informs Ghanauli. The others are Shiv Sena (Hind), six groups of Shiv Sena (Amritsar), four to five groups of Siv Sena (Ludhiana), another five to six groups of Shiv Sena (Bal Thackeray), Shiv Sena (Samajwadi), Shiv Sena Phagwara, Hindu Shiv Sena, Shiv Sena Akhand Bharat, Shiv Sena Maha Sangram and so on. Some groups are alleged to be the brainchild of intelligence agencies. They play in the hands of the government and are created to instill differences amongst Hindu groups, says Pawan Gupta.Apart from threats from Khalistani groups, these radical leaders say they also face threats from Lashkar-e-Toiba and Kashmir militants. All have led marches to Kashmir, mostly disallowed from proceeding further after Kathua, and some claim to have unfurled the national flag at Lal Chowk in Srinagar. Unlike the othes who are just using the name Shiv Sena I have a Kashmir unit in Srinagar headed by a Kashmiri, Abdul Khalid. I have also led a delegation to Kishtwar when riots took place there, says Pawan Gupta. The Hindu Suraksha Samiti chief, Panchanand Giri, at one time faced trial over charges of burning the Holy Quran in Punjab and also for threatening to kill the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Delhi.On Phagwara, Hindu Suraksha Samiti claims that their state president, Deepak Bhardwaj, arrested for the clashes, is innocent. He had no role nor was his weapon used in the firing. He will come clean in the inquiry, says Kehar. Pawan Gupta says his was the only organisation which condemned the Phagwara violence. No other Shiv Sena came out with a statement. They do not have the IQ to speak on such issues, he adds smugly.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Archive photo) Puducherry L-G Kiran Bedi had set May 31 deadline. (Express Archive photo)Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi kicked up a controversy with her announcement on Saturday that the administrations Free Rice Distribution Scheme to villagers would be made conditional to the certification that the village is open defecation free and free of strewn garbage and plastics.Bedi, who had also set a deadline of May 31 for villages to clean up and qualify for the rice scheme, later issued a clarification, saying she was withholding her order.Responding to Bedis statement, CM V Narayanasamy said her order showed she has no clue about its implications. It is against the National Food Security Act, 2013, which ensures free rice as a statutory right for 75 per cent of the rural population. She cannot issue any formal order and implement it without consulting us In the past too, she has returned several files on the free rice scheme by raising flimsy queries. Agricultural labourers, women, school children, the physically challenged and those in unorganised sectors are the major beneficiaries of this rice scheme. She will definitely face the consequences, Narayanasamy, who has had several run-ins with Bedi, said.Under the rice scheme, the Puducherry administration gives 20 kg of rice for those below the poverty line and 10 kg for those above the poverty line.Bedi, who made the announcement on Twitter, also sent a WhatsApp message to ministers, MLAs and journalists, which read, I hereby direct that distribution of free rice to the villagers shall be conditional to the certification of the village being open defecation free and free of strewn garbage and plastics by submitting a joint certificate given by the MLA and the Commune Commisioner to the Civil Supplies Commissioner. She added that until such a certification is issued, the free rice supplies will be kept on hold and in safe storage. It shall be distributed to the beneficiaries on the village being certified clean.Bedi later sent a letter to the Chief Minister and copied it to the Chief Secretary and other senior officials, with details of her directions to the Director of Civil Supplies. A notice to the villages be given for a period of four weeks till 31st May 2018 to make the villages clean, she wrote.As part of the clarification Bedi issued later, she said, The intention of my direction in linking rural Open Defecation and cleanliness with free rice distribution is NOT To DENY any poor persons of their entitlement, since I have already sanctioned and directed to provide quality food grains to needy families To avoid misreading of this intention and in view of the forthcoming commitment made by the UT Government that villages in Puducherry will achieve ODF by June end, I am happy to give them some more time. Therefore I am WITHHOLDING my earlier communications.Earlier, speaking to The Indian Express, Bedi had said the successful completion of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was the key objective and aim behind her decision to make the rice distribution scheme conditional.When asked what influenced her decision, she said, Today was my 155th round of field trip to see the same littered neighbourhoods. I realised that there is no other way but to implement this. When I visited some villages today, doctors reported of many diarrhoea cases. Why? Because their neighbourhoods are not clean I am sure my order will make community leaders proactive and they will make their villages clean within the one-month deadline that I have set, she said.When asked if the order amounted to denying food to the poor, she said, What is the problem in keeping your neighbourhood clean? I am doing it for the people and their health. Certain responsibilities have to be learnt. I did not say that I will deny them food. I used the word conditional. I am sure all villages will be cleaned within the time limit. If not, let them clean it and come for their share of rice. It will be in safe storage. You clean your village, and take your rice, she said.When asked where she got the idea from, Bedi said there was a research report that proves that a family can save up to Rs 15,000 annually if they keep their neighbourhoods clean. Parameswaran Iyer, secretary of the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation shared that report with me today morning. That was a confirmation of my order, she said.The Lt Governors order created an uproar, with many calling it hasty and illegal.Former Madras High Court judge K Chandru said, PDS is a very emotive issue and a matter of existence for the majority who live in villages. If you want a Swachh Bharat, there are be a hundred ways to achieve it. This order shows nothing but over-enthusiasm and a lack of knowledge in law. Its totally illegal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Not true, if Chef Manish Mehrotra is anywhere around. Give him some crispy golgappa puffs, some flavoured water, and he will turn them into haute cuisine.Yet, whats great about the chef is that he doesnt play around with the original taste or flavours. He gives you a dish as it is  but presents it in such a way that it opens your eyes. And your mouth, of course!I had a very nice evening at Indian Accent, now at The Lodhi, trying out some of the chefs special creations. The occasion was a promotion of New South Wales, so quite a few of the ingredients came from Australia. And the food was served with the wine from the region, which is giving a tough competition to established wines from other parts of the world.To get back to the phuchkas, as the golgappa is known in Bengal, the chef serves it atop tiny glasses filled with different kinds of flavoured water  tempered with mint, tamarind, pineapple, pomegranate and yoghurt. There is a masala couscous chickpea mix in the phuchka. You fill it with the flavoured water and pop it into the mouth. Tastes like phuchka that you may have eaten in Kolkata  but looks like an artists installation.The dinner, attended by New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian, sought to highlight the use of Australian-grown ingredients in Indian cuisine. Some of the ingredients included Australian lamb and seafood. And there were dishes such as slow cooked lamb with fenugreek, rice-crusted Australian John Dory and baked Australian barramundi.Chef Mehrotras expertise also lies in presenting food  so each dish was delightful to look at, too. The wonderfully sweet-tart-and-salty nimbu pani sorbet, for instance, came in a small pressure-cooker. The Australian lamb cornet was a succulent dish of pulled lamb in a crispy cornet. The spices were just right, and I liked the way the crunchy cornet (baked with refined flour and butter) complemented the juicy pieces of lamb.I enjoyed the baked barramundi, too. The fish came with small boondis flavoured with mint and Amritsari masala butter. The Australian John Dory was excellent, crispy from the outside and moist within.The two regions did a nice tango with the rice  crusted fish dish which was served with a bean foogath and coconut curry. Likewise, the slow cooked lamb with fenugreek came with a small potato chilla, which added both texture and taste  and a surprise twist  to the lamb dish.The dessert  Aamras summer berries and bitter chocolate  was superb. Beautiful to look at, moulded in bright yellow, with bits of red, green, brown and white, it was a delicious dessert with just the right sweet and tart mix and medley of flavours.It was a pleasant evening, with a bit of the old and the new. The old favourites were there, as were some new surprises. The chef says the new dishes would be a part of the menu if there is a regular supply of the ingredients from Australia.As I often say, keep the borders open."

On Tuesday, less than two weeks after the third death, the local police put an end to the suspense over the deaths by arresting Soumya.Over the last four months, neighbours of a family in Padannakkara in Kannur district of Kerala saw them die one by one. They all showed the same symptoms: vomiting, stomach-ache and breathing trouble. The first death was that of nine-year-old Aiswarya who was admitted to a hospital for 12 days, but passed away on January 31 this year. The second to go was her grandmother Kamala (65) who died on March 7 at the Thalassery Mission Hospital. A month later, on April 14, the family witnessed the third death in four months, that of 76-year-old VV Kunhikannan, Kamalas husband.By then, locals and neighbours, baffled by the mysterious deaths happening in close proximity, had decided to call the cops. All that remained of the small family living in a modest one-storey house was 28-year-old Soumya, mother to Aiswarya and daughter of Kamala and Kunhikannan.On Tuesday, less than two weeks after the third death, the local police put an end to the suspense over the deaths by arresting Soumya. A top police officer involved in the investigation told IndianExpress.com that the 28-year-old woman had confessed, after 11 hours of questioning, to killing her daughter and aged parents by mixing a toxic chemical in their food. She killed them as she believed they were coming in the way of her freedom and her choice of lifestyle. She had affairs with some men. Her daughter and her parents knew about it. I think she wanted them out of the way, he said.Photos of Soumyas two children  Aiswarya and Keerthana  at the family home in Padanakkara (Express) Photos of Soumyas two children  Aiswarya and Keerthana  at the family home in Padanakkara (Express)Police sources say her confession stands substantiated by the chemical analysis reports of the bodies of Aishwarya, Kamala and Kunhikannan. Traces of the chemical Aluminium phosphide, used commonly as a rodenticide and an insecticide, were found in the viscera sample and examination of the internal organs. Aishwaryas body was exhumed by the police especially to conduct the chemical test, four months after her death. The officer said Soumya had mixed the chemical in a plate of rice given to her daughter, in fish curry given to her mother and a bowl of rasam (a tangy soup) to her father.On Wednesday, Soumya was brought by the police to her home in Padannakkara, which falls in the native village of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Amid a massive crowd of neighbours and locals, the police had to struggle to get Soumya inside her home for evidence collection. As Soumya was brought in, her face covered by a shawl, locals booed and howled.We thought they were natural deaths. We could never even think of her doing something like this. Its shocking, said a woman neighbour. I have spoken to her mother a few times. She was a nice woman and used to work in a cashew factory. Her daughter (Aiswarya) was such a good child too. I used to see her going to school every day, she added.Soumyas maternal uncle Ravi is in a state of shock at the turn of events. We were so pained to hear of Aiswaryas death. Never for a second did we think it could be suspicious. But when Kamala died, we began to take note, he said. We have always heard of such incidents happening in other states. But when it happens in our state and that too, in our own family, its disturbing, he said. He added that Soumya had always spoken nicely to him even though he was cautious about her alleged liaisons with several men.Soumyas younger daughter had died in 2012 due to natural causes before she turned one. Her husband, Kishore, moved away from her after the death of the child.Police sources said while their primary assessment indicates that Soumya acted alone in the murders, they are still looking for accomplices. Investigation in the coming days would focus on finding who advised or helped her, they added.On Wednesday, she was sent in police custody by a judicial magistrate. A case has been charged against her under Section 302 of the IPC.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Express Archive) Madhya Pradesh farmers contend Pusa Basmati-1 is superior when grown in their region as opposed to being cultivated in states such as Punjab, Haryana. (Express Archive)Even as the Geographical Indications (GI) Registry has rejected the claim of Madhya Pradesh to be included as a traditional basmati-growing area, rice millers in the state are challenging the order. Central to their argument is that the quality of rice, from an improved variety, Pusa Basmati-1, is superior when cultivated in MP, as opposed to Haryana, Punjab or West Uttar Pradesh (UP).MP accounts for 50 per cent of Indias area under Pusa Basmati-1 and 70 per cent of the export of this rice variety to the western world (US and Europe). That itself is proof of the quality of basmati being grown by farmers in MP. Since GI certification is meant primarily to protect the quality of a product, it is unfair to deny recognition to MP as a basmati-growing state, says Ashwani Arora, managing director & CEO of LT Foods Ltd.The MP government had demanded that 13 of its districts  Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri, Guna, Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur and Jabalpur  be given the GI tag for basmati paddy, along with the areas of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and Western UP in the Indo-Gangetic plain below the foothills of the Himalayas. The GI Registry under the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, however, rejected MPs contention in its order dated March 15.According to Arora, whose Rs 3,500-crore sales company sells basmati rice under the Daawat brand, the soil and environmental conditions in MP are best suited for growing the high-yielding Pusa Basmati-1 variety. The traditional tall basmati cultivars are suited for saline and alkaline soils of pH 7-9 found in states such as Haryana. But Pusa Basmati-1 is ideal for the neutral to acidic soils of MP with 6-8 pH.Also, the shallow to deep black soil in MP is better for moisture retention. And with the main growing areas (Raisen, Vidisha and Hoshangabad) getting twice the rainfall of Haryana and Punjab, the crop gets enough water without a flood-like situation. That, in turn, also makes it less prone to pest and disease attack, says a company official.The common pests in basmati include the brown and white plant hopper (sap-sucking insects that attack between mid-September and mid-October), while diseases are mainly the leaf and neck blast fungus that infest the nodes of the plants main stem (from where the grain-bearing earheads or panicles emerge).The stagnant water and high humidity during late-August is particularly conducive to the blast in Haryana. Farmers, therefore, are forced to spray fungicides like Tricyclazole and also insecticides such as Buprofezin and Picoxystrobin against plant hoppers. All this leads to pesticide residue issues, whereas you dont get these conditions in MPs well-drained soils, the official states.The other advantage that MP has is the less sharp drop in temperatures during the October-November period at the time of flowering and grain-filling. While traditional basmati paddy or even other high-yielding varieties such as Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509 can tolerate these, Pusa Basmati-1 cannot. The latter when grown in MP, hence, yields better quality paddy with more grain length and less chalkiness due to more complete filling. That is precisely why Pusa Basmati-1 rice from MP has good consumer acceptance in the western world, adds the official.But whether this argument will cut ice with regard to GI certification remains to be seen. The GI Registry, in its order, held that MP did not satisfy the fundamental requirement of popular perception as a traditional basmati-growing area for being granted the coveted tag. Basmatis GI character was derived from its supposed uniqueness as a rice grown in a specific region. MP did not fall in this specific geography, namely the Indo-Gangetic plain situated below the foothills of the Himalayas.However, the fact that about 2 lakh hectares area is today under basmati cultivation in MP (of which 1.5-1.6 lakh hectares comprises Pusa Basmati-1), and the one million tonnes of paddy from this is worth Rs 2,600 crore, makes the GI issue fraught with complexity. What will these farmers do if they are denied the right to grow basmati? Can you force them to cultivate soyabean, which yields only one tonne per hectare (against 5 tonnes from Pusa Basmati-1) and fetches a marginally higher price (Rs 30,000/tonne versus Rs 26,000/tonne)? a rice miller in Mandideep near Bhopal asks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

She had also directed the civil supplies department to conduct a survey on whether people wanted rice or money.Complaints on qualityMs. Bedi had also noted that she had received complaints about the unsatisfactory quality of rice being distributed. The department should settle the bills of the suppliers only after the head of the department and secretary to the government concerned duly certify the quality of supplied rice. There should be continuous monitoring of quality through random sampling of rice under distribution, she said.The distribution would cost the government exchequer Rs. 15 crore per month. There are as many as 1,62,200 BPL, 1,51,380 APL and 27,000 AAY cardholders in the Union Territory.The distribution of rice was suspended for the last three months after Ms. Bedi raised a red flag on freebies due to the tight financial situation. She wanted to streamline the distribution by eliminating the affordable class from the beneficiary list.However, the government wanted to continue with the existing practice as it otherwise would be risking political damage with Lok Sabha elections around the corner.The government also did not favour money for the free rice being transferred to the beneficiaries. The account holders in most poor families are male members and there are chances that the money will not reach the female members. Direct Beneficiary Transfer for free rice will not serve the intended purpose. So we insisted on distribution of free rice, said a source in the government.Meanwhile, the civil supplies department had notified its decision to issue green card to eliminate higher income groups from the list of beneficiaries for free rice scheme. Those who voluntarily opt out of the free rice scheme would be given a green card. So far, the department has received only 50 applications, said a government source."

The mills will meet the demand and pay a commission of Rs. 31 a quintal to Telangana government out of the sale proceeds received from Tamil Nadu.For the favour of finding market to the rice of millers, the Telangana government insisted with them that they also pass on certain benefit to farmers who disposed of food grains at mill points for onward sale to government and the the Food Corporation of India.The Minister expressed satisfaction when the millers led by their president Gampa Nagender and general secretary V. Mohan Reddy called on him at the Secretariat on Sunday to discuss their pending issues in the presence of in-charge Civil Supplies Commissioner Sunil Sharma. Mr. Rajender advised them not to resort to malpractices in their transactions with the government.He warned them that criminal cases would be booked to recover outstanding dues of custom milling rice ordered from them.Speaking to media persons, Mr. Rajender expressed the hope that the present shortage of currency in banks would be overcome by the time distribution of cheques to farmers as part of investment support programme of government for agriculture is taken up. He said the Reserve Bank of India was asked to make arrangements for the programme four months ago."

However, the process they have developed, will help farmers earn profits from this waste product, which when burnt in the farms of Punjab and Haryana brings down the air quality of the region.Prof. Singh explained that a solvent system developed by Kriya Labs for the process is completely biodegradable, non-volatile, made of natural products and completely safe to use. The start-up hopes to find manufacturers who will use this technology to provide a safe alternative to crop burning.Kriya Labs director Pracheer Dutta, who completed his BTech from IIT-Delhi, said their solution to the problem of stubble burning will not only ensure a pollution-free Delhi but create rural employment by creating wealth from waste and contribute to sustainable development by starting a bio-economy.The project will be on display at the 14th Open House being organised by IIT-Delhi on Saturday, along with several other innovations that the students of the institute have come up with over the past year.Other productsSome of these products include an intelligent artificial leg, refreshable Braille display to enable digital access, waterless bathing solutions and a naso-filter that cuts out air pollution.The institute said over 1,000 school students from Classes X and XII will visit the campus, apart from college students and people from the industry. Besides new technology, labs at the institute will be thrown open to the public and lectures on various topics will be given by top faculty members.It is our objective to create a nurturing eco-system for students to inspire them to work on innovative solutions for our socio-economic challenges, said IIT-Delhi director V.

5b14fe429855b744d638f156,Chasing the monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/chasing-the-monsoon/article23579039.ece,2018-04-18,"The forecast of a normal monsoon has brought relief all around. For farmers, the India Meteorological Departments estimate that rainfall during the summer, between June and September, will be 97% of the 50-year average of 89 cm, is bound to raise fresh expectations. This is the third year in a row that they can look forward to a high output for a variety of crops, although fiscal realities have come in the way of realising higher farm incomes. The Centre has been supportive of higher returns through the Minimum Support Price mechanism and additional bonuses have been announced by States such as Madhya Pradesh for procurement, but these have helped mainly rice and wheat. From a water management perspective, though, this trend has led to a skew towards these crops, which are heavily dependent on groundwater. Now that another year of good cropping is expected, and unremunerative prices will depress public sentiment, it is vital for the Centre to arrive at a policy that gives constructive advice to farmers on the ideal cropping mix and help them get the cost-plus-50% margin that it has promised them. The IMDs decision to provide a more fine-grained forecast on the monsoons progress, particularly in the central and northern regions, will meet a long-felt need and can potentially guide farmers better.The long-term challenge is to make the most of the rainfall that India gets, ranging from a few hundred millimetres or less in the northwest to more than a few thousand millimetres elsewhere. The Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water drawn up by the Centre should be pursued scientifically, to help States with the most water-stressed blocks get adequate funds to build artificial recharge structures. Moreover, for those farmers who choose to continue with wheat and rice, transfer of expertise and provision of equipment that enables efficient utilisation of water is vital. An estimate of water used to grow rice and wheat, measured in cubic metres per tonne, shows that India uses more than what, say, China does. In the case of cotton, the figures present an even more staggering contrast: 8,264 cubic metres for India, against 1,419 for China. Combined with distortions in procurement subsidies, water stress due to such use is inevitable. On the monsoon as a whole, studies indicate a change in the pattern since 1950. There is an increase in daily average rainfall since 2002, barring some of the worst El Nio years, likely due to higher land temperatures and cooler oceans. What is well known is that a good monsoon raises agricultures contribution to GDP growth, while a drought year depresses it. Clearly, governments need to invest consistently to harvest the monsoon, both on the surface and underground, with community participation."
