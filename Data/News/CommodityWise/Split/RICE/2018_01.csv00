KUMARS_S_KUMARA new phase in the power struggle between Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi and the ruling Congress has opened up after Ms. Bedi made a vain attempt to link distribution of free rice scheme with getting a certificate by villages for cleanliness.On Monday, under the aegis of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, an ally of the Congress, several political parties came together on a common platform to launch an agitation demanding the recall of Ms. Bedi by the Union Government.DMK organising secretary and Rajya Sabha member R.S. Bharathi, addressing the protesters, said he would raise the issue of her recall in Parliament. M.K. Stalin (DMK working president) has deputed us to express solidarity with the Puducherry government on its fight against the anti-democratic ways of Ms. Bedi. We will continue with the agitation till she is recalled, he said.Flouted all normsIn a scathing attack on the Lt. Governor, DMK Rajya Sabha member T.K.S. Elangovan said Ms. Bedi had flouted all constitutional norms after she assumed office as Lt. Governor.The best example was her decision to administer oath to three BJP leaders as nominated legislators. By nominating three BJP leaders, she had given space in the Assembly for a party routed in the Assembly elections, he said.Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Minister K. Lakshminarayanan said the agitation against Ms. Bedi would gather more momentum in the coming days. Terming her style of functioning as autocratic, Mr. Lakshminarayanan said her decision to stop free rice to villages not having a cleanliness certificate showed her scant regard for humanity.It is not the job of public to clean the streets. They pay tax and instead of asking the civic body to clean garbage on the streets, you have put the onus on the public. We will intensify the agitation to make sure you do not come out of Raj Nivas, he said.DMK leader in the Legislative Assembly R. Siva said her style of functioning was public when she convened a meeting of officials even before taking oath of office.No respect for lawYou have no respect for law. You are only interested in power, he said in an obvious reference to the L-G.Former Minister and DMK leader S.P. Sivakumar, veteran leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) T.

Similarly, income tax payees, service tax payers and owners of heavy vehicles would not get free rice.In a release, Ms. Bedi said the Department of Civil Supplies had been asked to conduct a survey to identify the poor and needy families among the yellow ration cardholders in the first phase and among the red ration cardholders in the second phase who satisfy the criterion for priority households under the Puducherry rules.Choice for beneficiariesDuring the survey, beneficiaries would be asked to indicate whether they prefer free rice or cash. If the beneficiaries opt for cash, then the amount would be transferred into the bank account of the eldest woman member of the priority household as provided in the National Food Security Act, 2013.This survey would be completed in three months. After conclusion of survey, the free rice entitlements would be extended only to the poor and needy families as per Puducherry Rules, and as per individual opinion, that is either in cash or in kind.

Instead, it is contemplating promoting horticulture and irrigated dry (ID) crops such as maize and jowar. The government plans have twin advantages  the farmers get remunerative prices for their produce if they switch over to the horticulture/ID crops, and the gross value added (GVA) would improve significantly. Also, over-dependence on borewells and tanks, which is the case with paddy, is expected to come down.To start with, the ID crops and horticulture would be promoted in about 1.5 lakh hectare, which is under paddy cultivation, said a senior official from the Agriculture department, who did not want to be quoted.The government noticed that the farmers prefer to cultivate paddy even under limited water resources resulting in low net returns. As a result, the paddy prices are not encouraging. Sometimes, it is becoming difficult to ensure remunerative prices though varieties such as BPT 5204 (popularly known as samba masuri) are being exported.The minimum support price (MSP) is Rs. 1,590 per quintal. As the MSP announced by the Central government was not encouraging, the State government paid 200 more per quintal to see that the farmers would not feel the pinch of falling prices, sources say.In addition, the groundwater usage is very high. Farmers are dependent on borewells and tanks to cultivate paddy in more than 1.5 lakh hectare in the State. Also, water is not available to farmers under the Nagarjunasgar right canal for the last three years for about two lakh hectares.The approximate area used for paddy cultivation is 17.5 lakh hectare and 7.5 lakh hectare during khariff and rabi respectively. However, the cultivation during kharif is around 15.5 lakh hectare and the rest is left vacant for want of water and other reasons. The government proposes to bring down paddy cultivation from about 22 lakh hectare (both kharif and rabi) to 18 lakh hectare in a phased manner.The government, in view of these facts, is contemplating introducing agro climatic crop zone method as part of its strategies  water management, crop management and internet of things (IoT) in agriculture, to increase the farmers income. Under this method, crops suitable for the geographic region are suggested in a scientific manner. The government would encourage cultivation of fruits and vegetables, pulses and millets like jowar instead of paddy. The plans are likely to be implemented from kharif season this year.These plans, however, would not be implemented in rice bowl districts such as East and West Godavari (Godavari delta), Krishna (Krishna delta) and Nellore (Penna) and a few parts of north coastal Andhra, where farmers dependence on tanks and borewells is less. As much as 45.6 lakh hectare is used for agriculture in the State. In addition to that over 13.8 lakh hectare is under horticulture and 1.4 lakh hectare is under aquaculture. Out of 80 lakh hectare cultivable area, only 60.7 lakh hectare is being cultivated. The government feels that 11.8 lakh hectare can be brought under cultivation by following right agro climatic practices and efficient water management practices."

They are worried whether the tussle between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Telugu Desam Party would have an adverse impact on the project to be taken up jointly by the Central and the State governments.An unfulfilled dream of former Lok Sabha Speaker the late G.M.C. Balayogi, the 57-km-long railway project will be a game changer for the people of East and West Godavari districts in general and that of the Konaseema region in particular. As the train services provide economic mode of transportation to send agriculture, dairy and horticulture produce to different destinations, the rice and coconut rich region will benefit the most and that is the reason why people various sections formed as the Konaseema Joint Action Committee (KJAC) and launched a series of agitations to get clearance from the government for the railway line.Foundation stoneThe then Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee laid the foundation stone for the project estimated to cost Rs. 200 crore and Union Minister of State for Railway R. Velu laid the foundation stones for construction of railway stations en route in 2004. Now, the project cost escalated to Rs. 2,125 crore and about Rs. 1,200 crore had been allocated on paper.Of the three bridges to be built on Gauthami, Vainateya and Vasishta, the tributaries of the Godavari, the Railway Board released Rs. 346.87 crore in November 2017 for the one to be built across Gauthami connecting Kotipalli and Mukteswaram. The contracting firm visited the site in January this year and commenced the preparatory works. But, the actual construction work has not yet begun and there is no one to respond to our pleas, explains Bandaru Ramamohana Rao, convener of the KJAC.He alleges that MLAs from the ruling TDP are paying a deaf ear to the issue of late and not event giving appointments to the members of the KJAC.Fears allayedWhen contacted, Amalapuram MP Pandula Ravindra Babu says there is no need to have any doubts about the railway line, as both the Central and the State governments are keen on its completion.

A wave of viral white spot syndrome and all the shrimp, despite adequate care, is gone and the distressed farmer is virtually left with nothing.From rags to riches and back to penury, the small and marginal farmers who have been taking to shrimp farming in a big way in areas known previously for being part of a rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh are caught in a vicious cycle.Worried over the aggressive way shrimp farming is being promoted and the way paddy farmers were switching, Dandu Jagannadha Raju, a former agriculture scientist, has come up with a novel integrated concept of raising paddy crop in the middle of the shrimp growing tank and horticulture crops on the bund of the tank. My experiment is successful, as it will ensure triple income from shrimp, paddy and horticulture crops. A small shrimp farmer has some alternative to fall back upon  paddy, horti or even floriculture.True to what Dr. Raju, formerly of ANGR Agricultural University, claimed, there was steady stream of shrimp farmers, paddy farmers, agriculture and aqua culture scientists to the three-acre tank at Ananda Farm in Kovvada Annavaram village, near Bhimavaram in West Godavari, district during the last few days. What surprised most of them was the way paddy was grown in the middle of shrimp farm full of saline water.Integrated farmPeople were apprehensive about the experiment, but once they saw the fully grown local varieties of paddy (MTU 1121, MTU 1156 and MTU 7029-swarna) now being harvested, their doubts have disappeared. Similarly we have raised various varieties of vegetables and flowers on the tank bund, he said.Now that this integrated farm concept has shown good results, we will popularise and try to scale it up, said U.K. Viswanatha Raju, chairman of the Ananda Group, an aquaculture firm.It was in one of the groups shrimp tanks that this experiment was hosted. Of the three-acre tank, paddy was grown on 1.1 acres and the expectation is of pretty good yield while the remaining space of trenches were used for the prawns. An interesting feature was that paddy was grown organically without any chemicals. It looks like a symbiotic relationship. Paddy crop is using up the ammonia and nitrates and releasing oxygen that was important for the shrimp, Dr. Jagannadha Raju said.P. Muniratnam, a senior official of Agriculture department, said a deeper three-season study was required to measure the success. The department was doing a similar experiment with paddy and fresh water fish."

He said Mr. Modi was resorting to personal attacks as he had nothing to say in response to the questions he had raised on his governance.I had asked a couple of questions. Since Mr. Modi gives lengthy speeches on corruption, I had first asked him why his party chose B.S. Yeddyurappa, the man who went to jail on corruption charges, as its chief ministerial candidate for Karnataka. Secondly, I had asked him why he allowed Nirav Modi to escape with Rs. 30,000 crore public money, the amount equal to what the previous UPA government annually spent for providing work to rural labourers under MNREGA. I had asked him how his friend Amit Shahs son Jay Shah multiplied Rs. 50,000 to make it Rs. 80 crore in a year. He is choosing to ridicule me with personal attacks because he has no answers to my questions, he said.Let him [Mr. Modi] attack as much as he wants. It doesnt make any difference to me. As a responsible citizen of India, I dont counter my Prime Minister in the same way that he does. I dont personally attack him. But, I continue to ask him questions. This is the difference between me and him, Mr. Gandhi said.He said Mr. Modi did not have anything to criticise the Siddaramaiah government with either. The Siddaramaiah government has given free education to children. It has distributed free rice to the poor to mitigate their hunger. It has improved the infrastructure in such a way that even BJP president Amit Shah accepted it once. Since Mr. Modi has no issues to attack the Siddaramaiah government, he resorts to personal attacks, he said.Talk about your pre-poll promises. Talk about your assurance of bringing back black money from abroad and depositing Rs. 15 lakh in the accounts of every citizen. Tell people of Karnataka what kind of governance you would give if you come to power ... Talking only about me without uttering a word about these issues doesnt help you much, he told Mr. Modi.Terming the Union government anti-farmer, Mr. Gandhi said Mr. Modi did not utter a word when waiver of farm loans taken from nationalised banks was demanded.Mr. Modi did not waive farmers loans. But he did write off around Rs. 2.5 lakh crore corporate loans borrowed by 15 richest businessmen. When I asked Mr. Siddaramaiah whether he could waive farmers loans taken by cooperative institutions, he waived them within 10 days. There is no place for the poor in the BJPs heart, he said.Narendra Modi is choosing to ridicule me and indulge in personal attacks because he has no answers to my questions.Rahul Gandhi,AICC president"

A couple of weeks ago, I went too Shang Palace at Shangri-Las Eros Hotel and had a crepe filled with juicy pieces of roasted Peking Duck.The China speciality greeted me again earlier this week when I was invited by our dear relatives to China Kitchen at Hyatt Regency. The Chinese chef came with a browned and roasted duck  called Beijing style roasted duck. He deftly skinned and then chopped it into slices. A rolled out rice pancake was filled with the slices and then topped with thin slivers of cucumber and spring onion. Some hoisin sauce was added to this, the pancake was rolled up and served to us.It was, as expected, delicious. The duck had been cooked just right, was nicely moist and succulent. The duck skin, eaten dipped in some powdered sugar, was, however, not as crispy as I thought it should be.I remember the times when chefs used to complain that ducks in India were just not fatty enough. But there are duck farms now which give you plump birds. I was told the ducks that are used in China Kitchen get a special feed in the farm. They get to eat the same food that their brethren back home in China get, the restaurant manager said.What I liked about the prawn shao mai  dimsums filled with prawns and flavoured with Miso mayonnaise  was the added texture and flavour of a few beads of orange caviar that topped the dumplings. The caviar kept popping in the mouth, giving a nice aftertaste to the dish.I enjoyed the Sichuan Gong bao prawns. The prawns, large and juicy, had been cooked with dried chillies, onion, peanut and sesame vinegar sauce. The sauce was piquant and added its flavour to the soft-yet-crunchy prawns.As you know, I love my pork and was eagerly waiting for some to reach our table. We had asked for Hunan spicy sliced pork cooked with Chinese celery garlic, ginger and leek. I enjoyed it, for the pork was tender, and the flavourings were strong.I ate the pork with spicy chicken fried rice, and thought it was a nice end to a meal that wasnt just about food, but made memorable because of a raconteur among us who regaled us with some delightful stories about his ancestral village in Bangladesh.To go back to the duck, one of my culinary ambitions is to one day cook it at home. But it is a laborious process. The duck has to be washed and air-blown so that the skin loosens up (thats how it becomes crisp when put in the oven). There are different marinades for this, but Shang Palace uses brine water, vinegar, sugar, green onions and garlic. Some like to use honey. The poor duck is kept hanging for 12 hours or so to make sure that it dries up, and then glazed with maltose, which gives it a light brown hue, and adds to the flavour. Then, of course, it is roasted in an oven. And you have to make sure that you dont overcook it.One day, perhaps."

Governor Kiran Bedi withdrew her directive on free rice scheme, it was too late  various political leaders had given vent to their ire.K. Lakshminarayanan, Congress MLA and Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Minister, described Ms. Bedis decision as undemocratic and unconstitutional. Food is a fundamental right and the Food Security Act does not place any riders on beneficiaries... How can someone occupying Constitutional office go against the Constitution itself? he sought to know.Mr. Lakshminarayanan saw this as yet another attempt to scuttle the governments free rice scheme which was an election promise of the Congress.AIADMK legislature party leader A. Anbalagan said that Ms. Bedi was functioning in an autocratic manner. It was the duty of the municipal bodies and the private contractors entrusted with the work of cleaning garbage to ensure cleanliness. Free rice was meant for poor people particularly those hailing from the rural areas. Linking the free rice scheme to the garbage clearing work is uncalled for, he said.The Puducherry unit of Communist Party of India (Marxist) strongly condemned the authoritarian and undemocratic directive of Ms. Bedi. CPI (M ) secretary R. Rajangam said the Lt. Governor had denigrated the people and the directive was akin saying only clean people should be allowed to enter temples.Ms. Bedi had failed to take note that the free rice scheme was being implemented from tax payers money and not from her own funds. The CPI (M) would stage a demonstration in front of the Raj Nivas on April 30, he said.Former Member of Parliament M. Ramadass termed Ms. Bedis directive uncalled for and said that nowhere in the country such a condition was implemented.The linking of free rice scheme with cleanliness is quite contrary to law and the provisions of the scheme. The free rice scheme has to be implemented as per the rules laid down in the free rice scheme, he said. Keeping the villages clean may be a social desire. But one cannot connect free rice scheme meant for the poor with the cleanliness of the village, Mr. Ramadass said.Ms. Bedi had denigrated the people with her directive. It was the duty of the local bodies to maintain cleanliness, he added.Meanwhile, Ms. Bedis decision evoked outrage on social media and Twitter where reactions ranged from decrying the logic of conflating hunger and hygiene to criticism for confusing PDS for charity rather than a Constitutional obligation."

This was following the Union governments decision to impose an import duty of 9.36% on raw cashew nuts. The crisis hasnt abated. (Above) Women crack nuts using wooden mallets in a cashew factory in Kollam. (Below) Workers sort out cashews into various grades.Suresh KumarSujatha never went to school. Her mother took her to the nearest cashew factory when she was 10 years old. Instead of learning the alphabet, she learnt how to crack the nut with swift, precise taps using a wooden mallet. Why go to school in a place teeming with processing units, she was told.At 52, she sits hunched over a heap of sooty nuts. There is sadness in her eyes. She looks at her hands  dark, dirty, bearing the permanent burn marks of the caustic cashew sap. She has never worn safety gloves. We are back to work after four months, but we know this is just for a few days. They will close the factory again, she says, her voice cracking.Sujatha is one among the 2.5 lakh skilled labourers, all of them women, struggling for survival in Kollam in south Kerala. They lost their livelihood when the cashew sector plunged into an unprecedented crisis two years ago. Cashew processing has traditionally been a major industry in the State, generating annual export earnings to the tune of Rs. 5,000 crore and providing stable employment. Tourism brochures of Kollam still carry pictures of cashew workers, the regions stock icon of prosperity.But with nearly 700 factories in Kollam district downing their shutters, the sector is on a downward spiral, with exports down to half of what they were three years ago. Scarcity of steady work over the last couple of years has forced many of the women to take up odd jobs, including at construction sites and as cleaners in offices.No safety netAKM Cashews in Parippally, 23 km from Kollam city, has just reopened, its chimney belching out smoke after a long break. Inside the shelling unit you find women sitting in rows, nearly half of them above the age of 50. In the middle sits Lakshmi, 83, with stooped shoulders and high-index glasses. She agrees that age has finally caught up with her. Her frail hands cant shell the quantity they once used to.Lakshmi came to Kollam, the erstwhile cashew processing capital of the world, as a bride in the 1950s. She quickly became a part of the multicrore industry. I have been doing this for over 50 years, so when Im out of work its really hard to scrape through. Yes, I have children and grandchildren but I live alone as I dont want to depend on them. This is the only job I know, she says, holding up her scarred hands as testimony. Shanta, 58, agrees. This factory used to function round the year, sometimes even on Sundays. So we never thought of another occupation. Some young girls have now moved to rubber tapping, but at our age it is not easy, she says.The women engaged in factories are paid according to the quantity of nuts they shell, peel and sort. They are typically paid Rs. 36.18 per kg for shelling and Rs. 46.3 per kg for peeling. With most women shelling and peeling more than 2 kg per day, they take home Rs. 250. The brisk speed at which the shelling needs to be done demands some expertise, and so does the sorting of similar-looking nuts into different grades. There are over 30 grades, informs their manager Sunil Kumar.The women say it is not easy switching to another job. I dont know what a computer is and I have never attended a school. I am not good with numbers, and people dont want maids with ugly burn marks on their hands, says Shanta.Cashew workers are used to living without a safety net. The factories began closing down two years ago. But it took them a while to realise the gravity of the situation. When we first heard about the close-down, we werent that concerned. We thought it might be some internal issue which they will solve soon. But it started spreading like a contagious infection. In a couple of months, we found ourselves out of work and deeply in debt, says Lilly, 39, from Mundakkal in Kollam city. The small comforts they were accustomed to had to be given up one by one during this period. I have two teenage sons, and there are days when I ask them to walk instead of taking a bus to school. I fear the day they may come and tell me, Amma, we are not going to school any more. You work all your life for your children and suddenly you cant afford even their education, she says.There are stories of bedridden husbands, children dropping out of schools, and daughters whose marriages are on hold. Poverty may be a relative term in Kerala but Sreedevi, 42, from Chattannoor, 15 km from Kollam, says that they are too close to the precipice. The fall could happen any day. We get one rupee rice from ration shops [BPL cardholders get 25 kg of rice a month at Rs. 1 per kg] but we will soon have no kitchen to cook it in. She says the rent for her two-room home is three months overdue.Sreedevis friend Anitha, 37, was widowed eight years ago. Anitha cant stop worrying about her school-going daughters. I dont know what to do when the schools reopen in June, she says. She came to Kollam 15 years ago, as jobs were plentiful compared to her village in Changanacherry, in south-central Kerala. Everything was good in the beginning. My husband, a construction worker, wanted to enrol the girls in a good school. Even after his death, I managed for a while, shuttling between many units. But now there are no doors left to knock on, she says.Rajeev runs errands and helps with roasting at the same unit in Parippally where his wife Sindhu works. The couple, in their early thirties, live in a poky structure of mud and tarpaulin with their two sons. It rained last night, explains Rajeev, nodding at the puddles on the floor. He wanted to add a tin roof but couldnt raise the funds. If any one of them falls sick, things will go from bad to worse, he says, pointing to his children playing outside.With the factories lying closed and Employees State Insurance dues unpaid, the workers are unable to access even medical facilities. Sathi, 41, stands in front of her unfinished home at Navayikkulam. I had been working with VLC Cashews for the last 25 years. One day they closed the factory. For the last two years I have been jobless, struggling to make ends meet. We dont have a BPL card and there are days we are unable put food on table. We dont know what we will do in case of a medical emergency, she says.While the women workers live in perpetual distress, their employers plight is no better. They take you on another trip to the ghost factories, many of them in total disrepair. Shamima Cashew at Ayathil in Kollam city, silhouetted against a drab grey sky, is a picture of desolation. The peaked tin roof is rusting away, and dust clings to almost every surface. Some years back the place was teeming with women, hundreds of them working in shifts, says the security guard. There are many other such buildings in the area, some closed for good, some hoping to resume operations.Of losses and suicide attemptsThe crisis started in 2016 when the Union government imposed an import duty of 9.36% on raw cashew nuts. Before we could recover from the blow, the price of raw cashew nuts began to soar in the international market. Yet, there was no corresponding increase in the price of processed cashew nuts. The crisis was further compounded by the Kerala government hiking the wages of all cashew workers by 35%. This was an utterly unscientific decision, says Nizamudeen I., president of the Federation of Cashew Processors and Exporters.Another factor that is said to have contributed to the sudden slump was Vietnams takeover of the global market. Vietnams processing units are all mechanised, helping the country churn out the product in vast numbers. While the processing cost for 80 kg of raw nuts is the equivalent of Rs. 800 in Vietnam, its around Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 3,000 in Kollam. The Centre slashed the duty to 2.5% in February this year, but the industry was too crippled by then. The lower duty could reduce the burden a bit but it isnt enough to save the industry, says R. Vikraman, who runs a unit in Kollam.As the processors incurred huge losses, the enormous pressure proved too much for some. About nine months ago, when Radhakrishna Pillai, a cashew processor, stepped out after his morning tea, his wife thought it was for his routine stroll. She later found him hanging in the outhouse. Within a few days, the banks started their loan recovery proceedings.There were also reports of a few suicide attempts, including that of a processor from Chadanathope in western Kollam. The owner of Alfana Cashews was admitted to the hospital with slit wrists when all his five factories shut down one after the other and he was served with a revenue recovery notice.Another processor, Eenam Nazar, accompanied by his workers, did a sit-in protest in front of the Kundara branch of Syndicate Bank. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan tried to intervene on their behalf, asking the banks to stop evicting the defaulters until May. With the deadline fast approaching, pressure is mounting on the processors, and their families are also on tenterhooks. They panic if we do not answer a phone call or do not get back home on time, says Nizamudeen. Suicide is a recurring theme in every conversation with workers and processors.Taken over by banksThis property belongs to the Federal Bank Ltd. as per a court order. Trespassers will be prosecuted reads a board in front of Ganga Cashews in Nilamel, 40 km from Kollam city. Rajesh, the processing units owner, says you will see the same board in front of his house and packing unit as well. Bank officials attached all his assets under the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (Sarfaesi) Act, 2002, when he defaulted on his loan. The court had posted my case for January 30. But the bank officials turned up at my home on January 16. I was asked to pack and leave that very evening, and we did, says Rajesh, who now lives with his wife and 13-year-old daughter in a small rented house. He has been in the cashew processing sector for the past 23 years. He says he could have saved his business if only the bank authorities had considered his plea for an additional loan.While big exporters cleverly wrapped up their businesses and relocated, micro, small and medium enterprises were badly hit. Some big shots have started units in countries like Vietnam after closing down their units in Kollam. But all of us cant do that, says Nizamudeen.While the 40 factories run by the Kerala State Cashew Development Corporation and the Kerala State Cashew Workers Apex Industrial Cooperative Society are expected to reopen soon, offering work to over 15,000 workers till Onam, the private factory owners remain in dire straits. We hear that when the government started pressurising them to reopen the factories, one reputed company said they will hand over the keys and they can take over the factories, Nizamudeen says. There have been frequent protest marches, hunger strikes, seminars and discussions but an effective strategy remains elusive, leaving the medium and small-scale processors with little hope. They refer to themselves as wounded birds who may hit the ground any time.According to the figures put out by the Directorate of Cashewnut and Cocoa Development, cashew kernels exported from India in 2015-16 and 2016-2017 were 96,346 metric tonnes (MT) and 82,302 MT, respectively. Foreign exchange earnings from the sector in 2016-2017 was an estimated Rs. 5,212.78 crore. While the processing units need 16 lakh tonnes of raw cashew nuts annually to keep themselves afloat, local production comes to only 80,000 kg.Ways of savingProcuring raw cashew nuts directly from cashew-exporting countries without involving middlemen is the main challenge. Controlling the import of cashew products from Vietnam should be another step in reviving the sector, say industry experts. While government authorities insist that the Cashew Board, set up by the Kerala government in October 2017, will play an instrumental role in ensuring the procurement of raw cashew nuts, there remain doubts about the immediate impact of such measures. There are also plans to tie up with all the domestic farms. We will get raw cashew nuts from district farms, farms at Aralam and the Cheemeni open prison, and the ones under the Plantation Corporation of Kerala and the Kerala Forest Development Corporation, to keep the industry going, says S. Jayamohan, KSCDC chairman.Another scheme is to promote extensive cashew farming in a bid to make the State self-sufficient in cashew production. Last year, lakhs of cashew saplings of a high-yielding variety were distributed. The authorities plan to repeat the drive this year. The idea is to extend cashew farming to an additional 30,000 acres and end raw cashew nut scarcity within five years. The industry has welcomed the long-term revival schemes. But what it needs right now is an emergency life-saving measure.Introducing total mechanisation in a labour-intensive industry like cashew processing will also be unfair, given that 90% of the workers come from marginalised communities. Most of the underprivileged sections, including the SC/ST populations, are a part of the industry. So we cannot approve of anything that leads to their unemployment. There was a huge boom in the respective sectors after the Rubber Board and the Coconut Development Board came into existence. Forming a similar statutory body under the Government of India for the overall revival of the cashew industry is one possible solution, says N.K Premachandran, the sitting Member of Parliament from Kollam.There have been other suggestions for saving the processors. A softer approach in enforcing the Sarfaesi Act tops the list. The Act, framed to tackle ballooning non-performing assets, allows banks to auction the assets of the defaulter without any court order. It may take the banks years to liquidate the assets and recover their loans. Instead of taking that illogical step, they could come up with refinancing schemes. If banks waive the interest and penalties, provide the processors with new working capital, 90% of the units will come back to life. Special financial packages can be sanctioned to revive the sector after declaring it as a sick industry. The existing import duty of 2.5% should also be withdrawn, along with the GST on imported raw cashew nuts, says M.K. Salim, a former exporter.J. Mercykutty Amma, the State Minister in charge of Fisheries, Harbour Engineering, and Cashew Industry, is no outsider to the cashew sector. During her days as a trade unionist in Kollam, she was actively involved in protests demanding statutory rights for underpaid workers. But even her interventions have been in vain. I have brought this crisis to the attention of the Central government many times. But they simply refuse to acknowledge its seriousness and the disastrous consequences. So far they have offered no help, she says.Sujathas factory had closed without any notice, at a time when the women were most unprepared. But it is not a stray occurrence. Says Arundhati, 34, who worked in the same factory: Last November, when I left the factory in the evening, I had kept a basketful of raw nuts for the next day. When they said the factory was closed, I thought it was only for a few days and clung to the hope that I would be sitting in front of my basket very soon. Days, weeks, and months have passed since she last heard from her employers. Arundhati, along with many others, is slowly coming to terms with the bitter reality of being deprived of her only means of livelihood.I have been doing this for over 50 years, so when Im out of work its really hard to scrape through. Yes, I have children and grandchildren but I live alone as I dont want to depend on them.LakshmiCashew worker, KollamThe Centre slashed the duty to 2.5% in February this year, but the industry was too crippled by then.

Subsequently, the first and second phases were completed in 1965 and 1975 respectively. Further, the barrage was made operational in 1976 after connecting the bunds in the western and eastern sides by a reclaimed portion in the middle of the backwaters.The third phase of construction, which commenced in September 2014, will replace the earth bank in the middle by 28 steel shutters.Irrigation Department executive engineer Haran Babu said the installation of shutters would be completed soon. We have already fitted 14 shutters and work on the rest ie going on, Mr. Babu said.Once completed, the Thanneermukkom bund, with a total span of 1,410 metres, will have a total of 90 shutters including 31 shutters each in the western and eastern sides.The third phase is being constructed in 433 metres length and 12 metres width at a cost of Rs. 181 crore.Along with it, a new hydraulic boat lock in 14 metres width is also being installed. This, according to officials, is expected to make boat journeys through the lake hassle-freeMeanwhile, the officials said the the new bridge would be opened to traffic in the coming days. The construction of the approach roads connecting the new bund with the other two bunds in the western and eastern sides of the lake has been completed. The traffic will be diverted over the new bund before the demolition of the earth bank, said an official.The Thannermukkom bund road connects Vechoor in Kottayam district and Thanneermukkom in Alappuzha district.Although the embankment in the middle of the backwaters would be removed, the Irrigation Department has decided to keep two small portions in the waters at both ends of the new regulator.The decision has invited wrath of the fishermen community and environmentalists.Those opposing the earth banks point out that it would impede the natural flow of water on a permanent basis and result in further accumulation of silt. However, Irrigation Department officials said the earth banks were maintained as per the original plan and to cater to various needs."

We have set apart over Rs. 6 lakh for the project, including this years budgetary allocation and spillover funds, in addition to funds to be made available under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).Maradu municipality has no scope for any other form of farming, and of late, farmers were also concerned that their livelihood was in danger of becoming extinct, Maradu municipal chairperson Sunila Sibi told The Hindu .Apart from landowners, members of volunteer organisations, including Kudumbasree, and, more importantly, youngsters have evinced interest in the project.Ms. Sibi said it would be a welcome diversion for youngsters.The Agriculture Department has already booked seeds with the Thrissur-based Kerala State Seed Development Authority for launching the initiative. Since pokkali farming is done during the rainy season, officials are confident of sowing seeds in May-June and reaping the harvest by August-September if the monsoon runs its normal course.A Padashekara Samiti has also been formed based on a model of the bylaw provided to stakeholders by the Agriculture Department. The Samiti is likely to be registered by the end of this month once the number of landowners joining the initiative is finalised.Farmers are hesitant since no farming has been undertaken on the fields for years. That is why we have decided to launch the initiative on a small scale on a parcel of land that could be prepared for farming in a very cost-effective manner. It will be expanded to more areas depending on how successful the initiative is, said agriculture officer Chithra K. Pillai.Landowners can either launch farming on their own or give land to the Padashekara Samiti.Ms. Pillai said assistance for the project could be made available under various schemes as the governments policy is to encourage cultivation in fallow land.For instance, funding to the tune of Rs. 10,000 per hectare is available for non-traditional farming under the Speciality Right Scheme."

Parties including the Congress, the AIADMK and the CPI(M) in Puducherry condemned the move with the CPI(M) declaring that it would hold a protest in front of the Raj Nivas on April 30.Clarification issuedMs. Bedi issued a clarification: ...in view of misreading of the intent of my improving the living conditions of the poor in rural areas. She stated that the intention of her direction in linking rural Open Defecation and cleanliness with free rice distribution was not to deny any poor persons of their entitlement, Since I have already sanctioned and directed to provide quality food grains to needy families.

Kumaraswamy said on Friday that the party would not be cowed by attacks on its workers and would, in fact, only be strengthened by them.While speaking to presspersons during a roadshow in Chamaraja constituency, Mr. Kumaraswamy referred to the Gowribidanur incident in which a JD(S) activist was killed in a group clash. It was engineered by nearly 150 Congress goons. This incident underlines the Goonda Raj prevailing in Karnataka, he said, adding that the incident has strengthened the partys resolve to fight back through democratic means.Urging officials to crack down on such violent incidents, the former Chief Minister said failure to do so would hasten the States descend into chaos. Such acts will only boomerang on the Congress, he said, appealing to his party workers not to take law and order into their hands or resort to retaliation. Mr. Kumaraswamy said he would call on the family members of the victim to help them through all possible means.Referring to the Congress manifesto released by AICC president Rahul Gandhi in Mangaluru, Mr. Kumaraswamy said there was nothing new in it but a few programmes were being floated to loot taxpayers.He described Mr. Gandhis frequent jibes that the JD(S) was the B-team of the BJP as a repetitive exercise that is the result of the Congress having a lack of serious issues to address.Reacting to the Income Tax raids on a few contractors and seizure of cash, he said had proved his contention that contractors associated with Congress leaders were the main conduit.Earlier, Mr. Kumaraswamy conducted a roadshow in Chamaraja and sought votes on the basis of the development works taken up during his tenure as Chief Minister for 20 months. He also announced new programmes, such as loan waiver for farmers and enhancing pension for senior citizens.Later, addressing a gathering in front of the Chamundeshwari temple at K.G. Koppal in the city, Mr. Kumaraswamy criticised the Congress claim of distributing rice at subsidised rates to the public. He said its excise policy was destroying families and ensuring a steady flow of revenue through sale of liquor. It is your money that is going to the governments exchequer which is funding the Anna Bhagya scheme. I had banned the sale of arrack, he said while campaigning for party candidate and former University of Mysore Vice-Chancellor K.S. Rangappa."

This is worrying. How many more children must suffer from stunted growth before the Minister in charge of their welfare decides on whether to serve them hot-cooked nutritious meals or packaged/processed fortified mixes? And why does there have to be a choice between the two? Why cant India incorporate both? Is it really that difficult to keep a close watch on the quality of food served to children between the ages of three and six as well as take-home ration for pregnant and lactating women?Apparently, it is. If you put together the years of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government and the Bharatiya Janata Party government, no solution is in sight after more than a decade of discussions. The Minister of Women and Child Development, Maneka Gandhi, and her predecessor, Renuka Chowdhury, have always exercised the easy option: dense, fortified food for malnourished children, courtesy the manufacturers. But early this month, Ms. Gandhi locked horns with her own officials on arriving at a solution. While her officers are batting for take-home rations that are locally available and processed, Ms. Gandhi favours a quickly served, nutrients-fortified alternative. It is an old debate; one that involves big biscuit-makers and assorted corn puff manufacturers on the one hand and social activists on the other, with children caught in between.Data on malnutrition should serve as a wake-up call for the government: 38% of children are stunted and 35.7% are underweight in India. About 21% of children under the age of five are wasted (low weight for height), according to the National Family Health Survey-4 data.Eight years ago, when malnutrition deaths occurred in some districts in Maharashtra, a simple solution involving a protein-rich diet called Lapsi  a green millet mixture combined with water and milk  was given to malnourished babies. In Jharkhand, dry rations such as oil, dal, wheat or rice were given to mothers  until the contractor lobby forced the government to shift in favour of processed food.The point is to address malnourishment through locally produced, diverse food options that the country offers. Under the UPA government, the Minister in charge wondered aloud in 2007 about who would keep a watch on the quality of meals served. She asked what would happen if something fell into the food being cooked. Can we keep a close watch? Why not serve packaged food? This is a valid point of concern, but is it impossible to work out a solution? Or is there no solution because children cannot be quantified as vote banks?The writer is with The Hindu in New Delhi"

5b1528249855b75cf6a87c37,My interview with PJ,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/my-interview-with-pj/article23715086.ece,2018-04-29,"I generally say no to all interview requests, as Im not comfortable talking about myself. Instead of blowing my own trumpet, Id rather have my achievements speak for themselves, especially my tremendous track record as a journalist, author, public intellectual, private individual, caring husband, loving father, selfless human being, peerless feminist, and ruthless patriot.A unique honourLast week, however, I was in London when I received a special request for an interview. As you may have read in the papers, I have just won the 2018 UNESCO Global Prize for Fantastic Journalism by a Journalist from South Asia who is bald, Tamil-speaking, above 180 cm in height, likes curd rice and Limca, and whose official identification mark is a cow-shaped mole behind his left ear. The U.K.s NRI community contacted me saying they wanted to commemorate this unique honour bestowed on an Indian journalist.They said they would hire a well-known Bollywood lyricist, popularly known as PJ, to interview me in front of a live audience of 500,000 Indians who love their country so much that they would combust if they actually lived in India.I was about to say no when they told me that PJ had a fierce reputation for asking tough questions. So I agreed, but with one condition: it would be an unprecedented unscripted interview.An excerptAs it turned out, I quite enjoyed talking to PJ. For the benefit of readers who missed the event because they could not produce their last 30 years bank statements for the U.K. visa application, I reproduce below a brief excerpt of my interview.PJ : Shri Sampath-ji, Ill begin with a simple question. We all know how tough it is to be a journalist in India these days. Yet in the past four years, you have achieved more than all the paid journalists, fake news anchors, and C-grade celebrity columnists combined. How does it feel to be gods gift to Indian journalism?Me : PJ-ji, every time I scale the pinnacle of professional greatness, which I have no choice but to do every single day of my life, I do it not for my personal glory, not for Sampath, the journalist but for Sampath, the servant of the Indian reader. So, to answer your question, Sampath feels truly humbled to be gods gift to the people of India.PJ : Do you sometimes worry that you may actually be greater than you already are?Me : As Dronacharya told Arjuna in 6,300 BCE, and Roger Federer told me in 2007, when you are infinitely superior to all your contemporaries, it becomes difficult to surpass yourself because you are reduced to competing with yourself. But what keeps me going is the thought that I must not stop being an inspiration to the rest of humanity.PJ : So what happens when you are competing with yourself to become a greater you? Does the lesser you merge with the greater you? Or do you identify with both the competing yous in turn? Is Sampath vs Sampath like Kramer vs. Kramer , or is it like Alien vs Predator ?Me : My friend, the whole world knows that I am not from a privileged background. As a teenager, I used to sell filter coffee outside Stella Maris College. If someone had told me back then that I would one day be talking to PJ in Londons Talkatora stadium, I would have said, Yeah, right! And Vedic India had WiFi and plastic surgery!

Today, by evening, most boats will have set out.Peter, too old to go to sea and mostly dependant on pension, says some fishermen are venturing out to sea as families are going hungry. A few boats set out on Wednesday. Today, there are some more. If fishermen dont go to fish, there is nothing to eat.

They added that India would officially respond at the WTOs Committee on Agriculture meeting in June.In its 12-page document submitted to the WTO, the U.S. laid out its calculations of the value of Indias MPS programme for the four years between 2010-11 and 2013-14 using publicly available data.Indias apparent MPS for wheat appears to have been over 60% of the value of production in each of the last four years for which India has notified data, said the document. Its apparent MPS for rice appears to have been over 70% of the value of production in each of the years.For example, India notified the WTO that its MPS for rice in 2013-14 was just over Rs. 12,001 crore.That amounts to 5.45% of the total value of production, and well within the WTOs permitted cut-off of 10%.However, according to the U.S. calculations, the value of Indias MPS for rice that year was more than Rs. 1.7 lakh crore, which would be 76.9% of the total value of production.One of the issues raised by the U.S. is that Indias notification only reflect the national minimum support prices and do not include all state bonuses or other incentives that further increase the MSP provided to farmers."

Mansoor, a former engineer with the Irrigation Department and the secretary of the Chittur Pourasamithy, a mass memorandum seeking steps on the part of State government for environmental clearance for the project has already been submitted to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Efforts are on to convince the Union Ministry about the inevitability of the project. The non-release of water from the Parambikulam-Aliyar Project by Tamil Nadu has landed people here in dire straits. The paddy farmers are the worst affected. If the government could remove the hurdles in the implementation of the Kuriarkutty-Karapara project, it will be a great relief to the rice bowl of Kerala, says Mr Mansoor.According to P. Krishnankutty, a farmers leader, the project, on completion, could release 4.88 tmc of water to the arid regions of Chittur.It has been caught in red tape owing to the lack of political will on the part of successive State governments, he says.Other than ensuring better drinking water supply, the project can irrigate most parts of Kozhinjampara, Muthalamada, Chemmanampathy and Elavanchery grama panchayats While the project area receives an average annual rainfall of about 3,600 mm, the Kozhinjampara region receives less than 500 mm a year.As per the latest proposal, the project implementation will submerge an area of 839.56 hectares, of which 746.972 ha is covered by plantations and 76.904 ha by reserve forests, including 14.30 ha of the Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary.Officials of the Kerala State Electricity Board say the project is not going to create problems for the Chalakudy basin because more than 14 tmc of water spills over from the Poringalkuthu reservoir during the monsoon months to the Chalakudy river.The Chittur Pourasamithy wants the State government to submit a modified project report and put political pressure on the Centre to get sanction for it."

Further, procurement was delayed at IKP and PACS (primary agricultural cooperative societies) procurement centres due to shortage of labour and lack of storage space.Following unseasonal rains that drenched the stocked paddy at the market yards many farmers resorted to distress sale to rice mills instead of waiting for three to four days for the procurement of their produce at the IKP and PACS centres. If we wait at the IKP centres, we are not sure when the rains would come and damage our crop. Hence, we approached the millers directly instead of losing the crop in the rains, said Mudiganti Venkat Reddy, a farmer of Challur village of Veenavanka mandal.He sold 250 quintals of paddy to the miller in the process suffering a loss of Rs. 20,000, which includes transportation, labour charges and deduction of 2.5 kilograms weight per quintal by miller on the grounds of foreign bodies and moisture content, among others.Similarly, several farmers approached the millers for selling their produce for a lesser amount than the minimum support price fixed by the government.

Yadlapur in Raichur, is among the many villagers whose children work in Bengaluru.V. Sreenivasa MurthyIts a hot May afternoon at Yele Bichale, a village on the Karnataka-Telangana border. As the temperature rises to 40 degrees Celsius, most villagers are back home from work in the fields. For 12-year-old Jyothi, however, the days chores are far from over. She has to look after her two sisters, Narasamma (20), who is mentally challenged, and Nandini.Their parents left the village two years ago to seek work as construction labourers in Bengaluru, leaving the two siblings in Jyothis care. We have a loan, says Jyothi, who understands the desperation that has driven her parents and other able-bodied men and women from nearly a hundred families in her village to Bengaluru. Many have left behind their children or old parents.Distress beltRaichur in north Karnataka, along with neighbouring Yadgir and Gulbarga, sees very high migration to cities, especially Bengaluru or Hyderabad. Job guarantee schemes such as the MGNREGA or food security schemes such as Anna Bhagya have not been able to stem this tide completely as families struggle to pay back loans they have taken at high rates of interest.Barely a few kilometres from Yele Bichale, a similar story plays out at B. Yadlapura village. Buddalappa (62) looks after his 27-year-old physically challenged son, while his wife and second son are in Bengaluru. The son and daughter-in-law of Hanumanthappa, 70, are construction workers in the State capital. They have all experienced the desperation that forces loved ones to leave their homes. With elections approaching, many of these families are expecting their family members to return to vote. Lack of jobs and migration, however, are not big election issues here, says Venkatesh, a grassroots worker with the Grameena Kooli Karmikara Sangha. Even when politicians approach them for votes, villagers dont question them about these schemes, especially the implementation of the MGNREGA, he says.He concedes that Anna Bhagya (the free rice scheme for poor families) has ensured two meals for families and reduced the burden to an extent, but one non-institutional loan can mean a vicious debt trap.Anna Bhagya may ensure food and the MGNREGA may ensure some pay. But if there is a marriage or health issues or any major expenditure, they become vulnerable. If one gets sucked into the debt trap, they are sure to land up in one of the construction sites in Bengaluru, says a village leader.In his late 30s, Shalom has returned to Chennaveera Nagar near Bichale for a wedding. He intends to stay back till May 12 to cast his vote. He had taken a loan of Rs. 30,000 from a moneylender at an annual interest rate of 36%.We do not have land here. Daily wage is minimal, and we cannot repay loans that we take if we stay back and work in MGNREGA-related work, he says.A majority of migrant workers are expected to return a day before the elections to vote. Political parties have already started sending signals out to village leaders to get them back for voting. Candidates give them the return bus fare. It is an occasion to visit the village free of cost. Though not all may come for assembly or parliamentary elections, most make it to gram panchayat elections, says M. Nagraju, who is among those tasked with getting people back home to vote."

Already, 55 air-conditioned buses in Nagpur are running on bioethanol, he said.Mr. Gadkari was speaking at the launch of Telugu news daily Vijaya Kranthi here on Saturday.He said in states like Punjab and Haryana, the rice straw is burnt after the harvest. Instead, it could be used to produce ethanol. If the Centres decision gets a cabinet nod, Telangana would be one of the States to benefit, with at least 100 bioethanol factories set to be established.Bioethanol usage would save the country Rs. 8 lakh crore worth crude oil imports, the Minister said.The government is also promoting bamboo growing through agro-forestry to cut down import of wood, paper pulp and newsprint, which cost the country a total of Rs. 1 lakh crore, he said.River linkingMr. Gadkari felt that political differences should not turn into enmity and wanted all political parties to strive towards the countrys socio-economic transformation.He also mentioned the Central governments project to link Indravati river with Godavari sub-basin, which would be linked to Nagarjuna Sagar and Penna at Somasila up to Cauvery. The move would prevent 800 TMC ft water from going into the sea, he said, urging States not to bicker over 15 TMC ft or 20 TMC ft of water.He advised media to be independent and impartial, urging it to inform the common man about scientific innovation and research.Also speaking on the occasion, Telangana Jana Samithi president M. Kodandaram said a newspaper that has the ability to question the governments policies is much needed in the present conditions.CensorshipWe are seeing a situation where advertisements are used to impose censorship on newspapers. Messages are sent to newspaper offices about what to publish and what not to, he alleged.Achieving separate Telangana State was only one step towards development and there needs to be an intellectual churning to fix the development agenda.If Vijaya Kranthi is successful, it could be the forum for opinions across the spectrum, Mr. Kodandaram hoped.BJP State president K.

Satyanarayana is wrong since the values of potential evapo-transpiration taken for the purpose are higher than the values estimated by India Meteorological Department (IMD).During the cross-examination of Mr. Satyanarayana before the tribunal in New Delhi on Tuesday, senior counsel appearing for Telangana C.S. Vaidyanathan further argued that the crop water requirement estimated by the AP witness was inflated with the help of increased period of crop development. Although the witness denied the counsels suggestion, he did not explain the authenticity of input data on potential evapo-transpiration (PET) values.Data not verifiedOn intense probing on the PET, the process of water transfer to the atmosphere from soil through evaporation and from plants through transpiration, the AP witness admitted that he had not given details on input data sourced from the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) in his affidavit. Asked whether he had tried to verify the data at least on the website mentioned in his affidavit Mr. Satyanarayana said he had not accessed it so far.When suggested that no such data was available on the website concerned, Mr. Satyanarayana, the Director of AP Rice Research Institute, said: I do not know, cant say anything. On the source of information on the number of weather stations considered by CRIDA for estimating PET values, the witness said he had only spoken to the authors of Agro-Climatic Atlas of AP. He, however, sought time to answer on being asked that Telangana had computed lower PET values using the very data of CRIDA referred by him.Another senior counsel for Telangana V. Ravinder Rao examined the AP witness on soil mapping and soil classification for suitability of paddy cultivation. Asked whether the witness would agree to the fact that a majority of lands in Garidpally, Chilkur and Huzurnagar mandal of erstwhile Nalgonda district, presently falling in Suryapet district, are highly or moderately suitable for paddy cultivation, Mr. Satyanarayana said he could answer only after going through the original publication of the National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Utilisation Planning (NBSS&LUP)."

The practice of farmers raising black gram either as rice fallow pulses, or predominantly as a major crop by itself, in the interregnum of two paddy seasons has been in vogue in the delta for long.With additional importance being given by farmers to the cultivation of black gram and the availability of water always remaining an unknown factor for its cultivation, TNAU and the Department of Agriculture started to think on means to improve the productivity of the crop irrespective of water availability. In the process, they hit upon the novel broad bed furrows system.In general, farmers resort to just broadcasting of the black gram seeds and allow it to grow using available water. But in the new method, the farmers are required to create broad beds and furrows allowing flooding of water for irrigation, space for de-weeding and crop management activities besides allowing appreciable aggregation of plans and pods with little wastage.Observation on growth and yield attributes revealed that black gram raised in the novel broad bed furrows system with organic input addition in neighbourhood pits of furrows recorded more number of branches, pods and plants. Lengthy roots with more secondary roots with roots nodulation was observed strengthening our firm belief that the productivity would jump under this technique, said S. Porpavai, Head, SWMRI.There has been a marked increase in the number of farmers taking up irrigated black gram cultivation, especially after its price shot through the rooftop a couple of years ago. Besides, the Central Government has also been announcing a bonus along with the minimum support price for pulses in a bid to boost the pulses production.No doubt, the novel broad bed furrows system would increase the revenue returns for farmers taking up irrigated black gram cultivation, said Joint Director of Agriculture A. Mathiazhagan, speaking on the importance of the system."

Suresh Kumar told The Hindu that the production had declined by roughly 10% compared with the 2016-17 season.We have so far completed the procurement of 95% of paddy cultivated in the district during the puncha season. On an average, the puncha season yields 1.10 lakh tonnes of harvest. However, this year the production has declined.The average yield from one hectare has fallen to 1.5 to 2.8 tonnes from the normal 2 to 3 tonnes. At the completion of the procurement, we expect the production to go down by at least 10,000 tonnes, Mr. Kumar said.As per the data, paddy was sown in 23,500 hectares this year compared to 27,000 hectares in the year ago. Delayed harvesting of the second crop season (additional crop season) due to downpour in September-November months and attack of wild rice (vari nellu) in polders during last season forced many farmers to abandon paddy cultivation, especially in Kuttanad.Besides, early intrusion of seawater, drought situation, and infestation also affected paddy cultivation in the region, officials said.Procurement issuesOther than the decline in production, procurement faced issues in a few places after farmers and mill owners locked horns over moisture content and poor quality of the produce. This has led to a delay in procurement in some places. The procurement has been done as per the registration made by around 30,000 farmers online. The government has made contract arrangements with mills for processing the paddy."

(Clockwise from top) Phool Kumari Das, whose husband Anil Das died of arsenic-related cancer, holds their family photos in Madhusudankati village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal; Students of class one in Madhusudankati's primary school; Monotosh Biswas, a 65-year-old farmer, has been suffering from arsenicosis for over two decades.K.R. DEEPAKOn a Thursday morning at the government primary school in Madhusudankati, a village in West Bengals North 24 Parganas district, a gaggle of five-year-olds chatter animatedly in a classroom. A teacher walks in. They stand up and chant Good morning, teacher in a high-pitched sing-song. There is momentary quiet, and the rustle of textbooks being opened, but the giggling and chattering return soon. Its a school scene that is as ordinary as it gets, but behind its normalcy lies a disturbing fact: the bodies of these children contain alarming levels of arsenic  a poisonous metalloid that sickens and kills with chronic exposure. Unlike the adults in Madhusudankati though, the children dont show any symptoms yet.Madhusudankati is a lush green agricultural village about 14 km from the border with Bangladesh and deep inside Indias arsenic territory. About 15 years ago, scientists discovered that the shallow groundwater here had high levels of the mineral: up to 1,000 micrograms (mcg) per litre in places. The World Health Organisations (WHO) prescribed safe level is 10 mcg per litre. When such water is consumed for years, either directly or through the food chain, the mineral damages organs like the skin, kidneys and lungs.The most visible symptom in early years is a classic blotchy pattern on the skin, a condition called raindrop pigmentation. If people showing such pigmentation dont switch to safer water, they develop hyperkeratosis  dark crusts on their palms and soles, which can get infected and make it painful to work. Eventually, the skin can turn cancerous. Simultaneously, arsenic can destroy the kidneys and liver tissue, cause conjunctivitis and affect the lungs, just as heavy smoking does. There are few organs that arsenic spares.Mass poisoningToday, an estimated 10 million people in nine districts in West Bengal drink arsenic-laden groundwater. It is the worst worldwide case of mass poisoning alongside Bangladesh, which has 40 million people at risk. When West Bengals problem first attracted international attention in 1995, a researcher from the University of Colorado compared its scale with the Chernobyl disaster. Today, we know it is worse. But despite the grave warnings from international bodies like the WHO, the West Bengal government has moved excruciatingly slowly to tackle the crisis. A critical shortcoming in its efforts was the delay in realising that mitigation is a sociological challenge, not just a technological one. This is why, even though multiple technologies to filter arsenic from groundwater are there, awareness of arsenics ill-effects remains low. So, people continue drinking toxic water, even when alternatives exist.Madhusudankati is an example of this. In 2013, a farmers cooperative society, the Madhusudankati Samabay Krishi Unnayan Samity (MSKUS), installed a water treatment plant in the village with help from the Sulabh International Social Service Organisation. Today, the plant supplies treated water from a local pond to 500 families and the primary school. However, studies show that despite the availability of MSKUS water, several people continue drinking contaminated groundwater.In August 2017, a team led by Tarit Roychowdhury, an Associate Professor at the School of Environmental Studies (SOES) in Kolkatas Jadavpur University, collected urine, nail and hair samples from the children in Madhusudankatis primary school. By then, the school had stopped using water from its contaminated tube well for drinking and cooking midday meals, switching to MSKUS water instead. Several village families had done the same.Yet, Roychowdhurys team found between 20 and 200 mcg per litre of arsenic in the childrens urine, a sign that they were still consuming the poison. This means the children are still drinking polluted water at their homes or somewhere else, says Roychowdhury.Outwardly, the children seem symptom-free. Arsenic is a silent killer; it takes years for keratosis to show in adults and even longer in children. But there is extensive evidence that children are not immune to internal damage  their lungs, kidneys and other organs are slowly being ravaged. Studies also show that arsenic-exposed children have lower IQ compared to control groups. If they continue drinking this water, they will definitely develop keratosis, says Roychowdhury.Years of neglectIn 1983, a doctor called Kshitij Chandra Saha from the West Bengal Health Services began examining a cluster of patients with skin lesions in the formerly undivided 24 Parganas district. Saha diagnosed them with arsenicosis, the first record of the illness in the Indian subcontinent. In the following years, Saha and epidemiologist Dipankar Chakraborti, the founder of SOES, surveyed more villages. It dawned upon them that they were uncovering a massive epidemic. By 1988, six arsenic-affected districts had been identified along the eastern border of West Bengal. The source of the toxin seemed to be the thousands of shallow tube wells that dotted the region. But there was confusion about why the arsenic was there  some suggested that the metal strainers in the tube wells were leaching the mineral, some thought pesticides were the culprit, and some others thought arsenic-treated electric poles were at fault.The researchers sounded the alarm. They warned the government that people would grow sicker unless they switched immediately to safe water. But the governments first reaction was denial, Chakraborti noted in a paper published in the journal Talanta in 2002. It was a theme that continued for years. The government did appoint committees in 1983, 88, 92 and 93 to examine the problem, but the findings didnt trigger substantial action. Presciently, a member of the 93 committee even resigned, saying schoolchildren were continuing to drink contaminated water because the government wasnt digging alternative tube wells. Over a decade later, researchers are still reporting the consumption of contaminated water by schoolchildren in districts like Malda.After denial in the initial years came some questionable decisions by the government. Even though the State had tested 1,32,267 tube wells for contamination by 2007, the polluted wells werent marked. Instead, the government dug alternative tube wells in some spots and installed filters in some others. Several experts, and the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), advocated that unsafe tube wells immediately be painted red, so that people would avoid them. But there was strong resistance to the idea from the government, says Kumar Jyoti Nath, the chairman of West Bengals Arsenic Task Force, an advisory body. We told them again and again that the scientific truth must be shared with the public. But they said it would create panic, Nath says.UNICEF consultants, SOES, and Nath were also of the opinion that public outreach ought to be the foundation of the governments mitigation strategy. This would mean not just painting wells, but also holding door-to-door campaigns, conducting street plays and distributing flyers about the danger of using contaminated tube wells. Unless this happened, patients would not go to government-run arsenic clinics or switch to safe tube wells. But this did not happen on a large enough scale.Such outreach campaigns would have needed dedicated communication experts, which the government did not have. The West Bengal Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), which is at the helm of the States mitigation efforts today, is manned by engineers. There was no one to advise them on the communication strategy; on how to ensure peoples participation, says Nath. So, the department has always been hardware-oriented. The software has been neglected.Impact on hardwareThis neglect impacted the hardware too. Over the years, countless arsenic-filtration technologies were developed by institutions like the SOES and the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute. Some, like SOESs filter, were for household use. This device had two components. This first was a tablet made of an iron salt, an oxidising agent and activated charcoal which reacted with arsenic in water to turn it into a filtrable floc. The second component, a fly-ash filter, would filter out the floc, which would then have to be disposed of safely. But even though the SOES filter and others like it worked flawlessly in the lab, they failed frequently in the field. Several people couldnt figure out how to use them. During an evaluation, Roychowdhurys team found that villagers would use multiple tablets in the filter instead of one, or expose the tablets to sunlight, or let the filter run dry. Such problems plagued community filters too, which were designed for several households. Toxic arsenic sludge was sometimes disposed of unsafely, sent back into the environment, instead of being treated as per protocol. Meanwhile, materials used in the filter, such as bleaching powder, werent stored properly, causing them to lose efficacy. At some point, you realise that the investments in hardware are not yielding returns, because you have not invested in awareness, says Nath.In 2016, a study in North 24 Parganas district, jointly conducted by UNICEF and PHED, found that merely marking tube wells as safe or unsafe and conducting awareness campaigns brought about large behavioural changes. Even if we dont provide alternative safe water sources, just marking tube wells can go a long way in mitigation, says Shyamnarayan Dave, who was a UNICEF consultant to the West Bengal government till 2015. But the State government realised this truth rather late. Almost after a decade of advocacy for awareness campaigns, it officially began painting tube wells two years ago.A geological curseEven as the government struggles to implement technological solutions to arsenic contamination, there is good news on another front. Scientists today broadly agree on the source of arsenic in the Ganga delta, a consensus that didnt exist earlier. John McArthur, a geochemist at the University College of London, explains the science in simple terms. The process is thought to have begun between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago, when small Himalayan rock particles, coated with iron oxide, entered the Ganga river delta. Along the way, these particles absorbed the tiny amounts of arsenic in the river water, like a sponge soaking liquid. These particles were then deposited in layers of sediment, over thousands of years, in what is now West Bengal and Bangladesh.Here, the rocks stayed in a more or less stable state until another actor entered the scene: decaying organic matter, or peat, says McArthur. The Ganga delta was also home to swampy wetlands some 5,000 years ago. The organic matter from these wetlands is now decaying slowly, alongside the arsenic. When the bacteria responsible for this decay come in contact with the iron oxide in the arsenic-bearing rocks, they use the oxygen from the iron oxide for their own metabolism, setting both arsenic and iron free. This is why the groundwater in West Bengal and Bangladesh are rich in both minerals.The free arsenic, buried under the soil, did not pose a human threat until three decades ago. Till then, most Bengali and Bangladeshi homes depended on lakes and rivers for their domestic needs. But some time in the 70s, families switched en masse to tube wells, because the surface water was growing increasingly contaminated, spreading diseases like cholera. In this region, you can get groundwater at depth of a few meters. So, everyone began digging tube wells in their own backyards, says Roychowdhury. This unleashed the underground arsenic.There is uncertainty today on how the geological mechanism of arsenic release impacts policy. Researchers agree that shallow tube wells, less than 150 meters deep, are the worst affected, because they contain arsenic-rich sediments from the Holocene era, when the arsenic arrived in the delta. Conversely, deep aquifers, more than 150 meters underground, are unaffected because they tap into the older Pleistocene sediments. According to McArthur, such deep tube wells can potentially be used for a long time without fear of contamination, as they have been in Bangladesh. The smart money is on the deep aquifer remaining viable for many decades, if not forever, he says.But Roychowdhury argues that even deep aquifers can become tainted with the overuse of groundwater. Such overuse is disturbing the clay separating the deep and shallow aquifers, allowing the arsenic to enter previously pristine waters, he says. His research seems to bear this out. In a study in North 24 Parganas, deep tube wells which were uncontaminated initially saw arsenic levels rise in about five years. If this phenomenon is typical across West Bengal, the governments initial strategy of digging deeper tube wells to replace shallow ones may not even be a good stopgap. Until we stop using groundwater, and focus on watershed management, this problem will remain, he says.Piped dreamThe endgame for the West Bengal government is to replace all groundwater for domestic use with water from the river Hooghly, using pipelines. But there are technical and financial challenges in laying such long pipelines. A senior official from the PHED, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the total cost of providing river water to all villages was an estimated Rs. 100,000 crore, money the government currently doesnt have.This is why the States short-term strategy is to provide Hooghly water to about half the arsenic-affected villages. The other half are to be served by community arsenic-treatment plants. The first part of this strategy has been easy to execute, because West Bengal has years of experience in sanitising surface water. Even though this water is heavily contaminated with bacteria, technologies to remove these bacteria have been tried and tested. For bacteriological quality improvement, we have experience for over 150 years, says Nath. The first water treatment plant in Kolkatta was 175 years old. The problem lies with arsenic-removal technologies, which are still emerging.About 170 such community arsenic treatment plants are to be installed across the State before the end of 2018. This deadline could be tough to meet, given that only 60 plants have been commissioned so far. Moreover, many of the commissioned plants are still operating at low efficiency because of maintenance issues.A socially isolating illnessUntil West Bengal is able to get safe water for all the 10 million at risk, its villages will remain dotted with tragedy. In Madhusudankati, a few km from the primary school lives a farmer, Monotosh Biswas. About 25 years ago, he began showing symptoms of toxicity. Today, his torso, palms and feet are dotted with lesions. A few years back, he developed Bowens Carcinoma, a skin cancer, on his hip. He went to Kolkata to get the lesion removed, spending Rs. 12,000 on medicines. While Bowens Carcinoma is treatable, others in the village have died of more lethal cancers.Between shallow breaths, a sign of arsenic-induced bronchitis, Biswas says his illness has also affected his farm work. The impact of arsenicosis on ones livelihood and the social stigma attached to it extracts a high cost from sufferers, says Kunal Kanti Majumdar, a doctor at Kolkatas KPC Medical College, who has worked in arsenic-affected areas for about two decades now. Wherever I went, I found depression, social isolation and suicidal thoughts. It is not just a health problem, but also a social problem, he says.As researchers fret about tackling the crisis, the schoolchildren in Madhusudankati are untroubled. It will be lunchtime soon. Roychowdhurys team collects food samples from the kitchen, which will be tested. Even though the school water is now safe, the rice and vegetables being used could have been grown in soil containing arsenic. Understanding the impact of this on the children is the teams next goal. So far, we have only tested water and biological samples. Now, we have to test the food, says Roychowdhury. Maybe it will have arsenic. Maybe it wont. Let us see."

While some regions water supplies were found to be relatively stable, others experienced increases or decreases. What we are witnessing is major hydrologic change, said Jay Famiglietti of NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).We see a distinctive pattern of the wet land areas of the world getting wetter  those are the high latitudes and the tropics  and the dry areas in between getting drier. Embedded within the dry areas we see multiple hotspots resulting from groundwater depletion, said Mr. Famiglietti.He noted that while water loss in some regions, like the melting ice sheets and alpine glaciers, is clearly driven by warming climate, it will require more time and data to determine the driving forces behind other patterns of freshwater change."

But there is another reason why Ernakulams pokkali fields and cultivation need to be conserved. They support as many as 174 of the 516 bird species in the State.The online citizen science platform, eBird, where birdwatchers upload their daily birdwatching data, has listed 174 bird species (from 430 checklists) since 2011 in pokkali fields near the Kadamakkudy rice field alone.We see a lot of bird species in pokkali fields, be it in the Kadamakkudy area or Kandakadavu and Kalathara regions near Thoppumpady - Palluruthy, says Vishnupriyan Kartha, secretary of Cochin Natural History Society which organises bird watching sessions in the area on a regular basis.Species sighted in pokkali fields include the commonly-seen egret species, rare ospreys, migratory birds like sandpipers and plovers, and the difficult-to-spot black-capped kingfisher, he says.Studying birdsBetween 2006 and 2009, researchers at Thiruvallas Mar Thoma College (MTC) surveyed five-hectare pokkali fields for bird diversity at Kadamakudy, Kuzhuppilly, Kumbalangy, Edavanakad, and Cheranelloor in Ernakulam district. Of the 119 bird species they counted, 84 are resident species such as the Indian cormorant and stork-billed kingfisher.The 35 other bird species are migratory, and they arrive in the tropics during winter to avoid the extreme cold of their natural breeding grounds.Thirty of the migratory bird species the team recorded are transcontinental migrants flying in from as far as Siberia and Eurasia, including the long-legged black-tailed godwit and the garganey (a small wild duck).According to John George M., former professor at MTC, who led the research, the pokkali wetlands also supports near-threatened bird species like the oriental darter, black-headed ibis, and spot-billed pelican.Need for conservationPokkali is cultivated along the coast in the districts of Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Thrissur. In these paddy fields, rice cultivation occurs only for a few months of the year, after which the fallow fields function as shrimp or fish farms. Pokkali is considered to be one of the only naturally-produced organic rice varieties of Kerala, for it does not require fertilisers or pesticides.Though pokkali farming was extremely common in the district, only about 10% of approximately 10,000 hectares of pokkali land is under cultivation, say officials of the Rice Research Station at Vyttila.Around 50% of this area is now under fish and prawn monoculture, with rice cultivation being discarded.Pokkali fields need to be urgently conserved, and farmers should be encouraged to cultivate the crop, says Deepa K.M., who conducted the study as part of her doctoral thesis. For ease and profits, many farmers are now turning away from the traditional method of cultivation by not cultivating rice and farming only shrimp. Our work shows that both are required to sustain high bird diversity, she adds."

Rangasamy on Thursday censured Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy for blaming Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for all the failures and called upon Puducherry government to address peoples issues.Dubbing the Narayanasamy-led regime a non-performing government, Mr. Rangasamy accused it of failing to implement poll promises. Addressing the media on Thursday at his party office, he said that Mr. Narayanasamy had made it a practice to blame the Lieutenant Governor for everything.On the one hand, the Chief Minister accuses the L-G of being a hurdle in the implementation of the schemes and on the other hand we see the ministers continuing to meet to get their files cleared. I do not understand this drama. This is affecting the people and the progress of the State, he said.Poor managementHe accused the government of failing to implement new schemes and announce financial assistance to students. Even those students who have taken loans are struggling to continue their studies. The government has failed to disburse the salaries of the employees working in public sector units, due to which they are unable to pay their childrens school fees, he claimed.The former Chief Minister alleged that the government has failed to provide loans to the backward classes. The constituency development funds have not been disbursed, the government has not been providing free rice regularly to all the poor. They have not implemented any projects for the farmers, backward communities, weavers or fishermen. They have failed to implement the public welfare schemes as well. How long will they blame the LG for this? They have even cancelled seven liquor licences for PASIC. We dont know who benefited from it. The cooperative sugar mills have shut down, affecting the sugarcane farmers. They are giving excuses and blaming the LG for their own failures, he said.Law and order worstMr. Rangasamy said the government did not function for the progress of the State. Mr. Narayanansamy has been constantly claiming that the law and order is under control. But what is happening today? Two murders occur in one day, vehicles are set on fire. Theft and burglary continue. Even the government officials are scared to leave their homes locked due to the fear losing valuables. A few days ago, there was violence in Kalapet and it is alleged that a Congress member was responsible for that. We see that law and order is not under control and crime is increasing every day, he said.Pointing out that the Chief Minister has asked the Lieutenant Governor to resign for receiving a letter from the Central government, he questioned: What should a government which has neither shown any progress nor realised their poll promises do? Should such a government stay? he asked.Mr. Rangasamy said that the activities of the present government for the last two years have not been for the progress of the state. There are no new industries in Puducherry. Has the government created any new employment opportunities? How many educated youth has Puducherry employed in the last two years? Only if there are new industries there can be jobs. The development of this State remains a question, he said while adding that his party would soon meet the Home Minister with a complaint against the government. We will approach the Central government at the earliest and apprise them of the situation here, he said."

When we go to meet Sahebru either in Mysuru or Bengaluru, he recognises us and asks us the reason for coming to him, said Kari Gowda, another resident of the village, who is also a far relative of Mr. Siddaramaiah.On the day of filing their nominations, Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Yathindra had both visited the village and offered pooja at the temple before seeking the blessings of the people and leaving for the Returning Officers office.While the portion of the village around Mr. Siddaramaiahs house is mostly inhabited by the roughly 250 Kuruba families, another area of the village is occupied by an estimated 250 families of Vokkaligas, most of whom own lands irrigated by the Hullahalli-Ramapura canal. Yet another portion of the village has about 300 families of Dalits, many of whom work as agricultural labourers for the Vokkaligas or go to Mysuru for work.The Vokkaligas, who grow paddy on their irrigated fields, depend on Dalits for planting the rice seedlings. They are the ones who are doing it for generations. We dont know how to plant the seedlings, confessed an elderly Vokkaliga.During a chat with the Vokkaligas of the village, it emerges that though many elderly residents supported Mr. Siddaramaiah, a section of the youth of the community are disenchanted. The reason  Mr. Siddaramaiahs alleged preference for Kurubas and Dalits for jobs in the University of Mysore and the newly-established Jayadeva Hospital.A section of the Vokkaliga youth will vote for JD(S) candidate Abhishek even though he is a political greenhorn, said the elderly Vokkaligas. These youth would have voted for former Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappas son B.Y. Vijayendra had the BJP fielded him as he was considered to be a stronger candidate. Now, they will support the JD(S).Some Vokkaliga farmers also shared their discontent over the failure of the authorities to release water in thew canal for their paddy crop. Though some of the crop has been damaged, we are hoping that we manage to save much of the paddy, thanks to the recent rains in the area, one of them added.However, a local Congress leader Manjunath, who also belongs to the Vokkaliga community, sought to downplay the disenchantment over jobs. There will always be such complaints. How is it possible to provide everybody a government job, he asks, before adding that the youth were told to apply for jobs at a couple of private companies that had recently opened near Siddaramanahundi. But, they had not shown any interest."

The meeting was called to discuss the possibility of exempting tourists from hartals and the impact of implementing the Food Security Act in the State.The meeting expressed concern over the flash hartals affecting the tourism industry. Such hartals were giving a wrong message to tourists about the State. Hartals could not be avoided totally, but a caution should be exercised on this score.

They garlanded his statue here on Tuesday.Speaking on the occasion, former parliamentarian and Agriculture Minister Vadde Sobhanadreeswara Rao said that people of the State, especially those living in the delta area, were indebted to the Britisher, who felt the importance of building anicuts across the rivers to save a huge quantity of water. His visionary act has resulted in delta area of Andhra Pradesh turning into a rice bowl. He said Mr. Cotton argued with the British government which was not keen on building the anicut across river Krishna. With no sophisticated gadgets available, it was a hard task for him to supervise the works. But with dedication and sincerity, he completed the projects in a short span of time.Mr. Rao said that Mr Cottons act revolutionized agriculture in the State and added that the great engineer also developed canals and even began navigation thus bringing a new a twist to transportation. He said the East Godavari people had so much affection for Mr. Cotton that they even performed pindapradhanam to the departed soul.Intense commitmentCherukuri Veeraiah, irrigation adviser to the State government, said that the commitment of Mr. Cotton was so intense that he stayed close to the project site instead of staying in Rajahmundry.Mr. Veeraiah said Mr Cotton was God to the people of coastal Andhra for he constructed four anicuts in just five years. He said young engineers should take their cue from the great visionary whose actions would be remembered for as long as there was humanity.Krishna Delta Parirakshana Samiti president Konalakonda Sivaji, Congress leaders N.

We didnt want to take any chances after the boy died, says Nizamuddin, a madrasa official attached to the Bilal Masjid.Photographs clicked by a heritage enthusiast, a few days before it was filled up, show a deep well cut into the rock with steps leading all the way down.At an upper level was a row of arches where visitors could walk around. A pulley arrangement for drawing water from the well at a higher level completes the picture. It was fenced with chicken mesh and there was a lock and key arrangement. How the boy reached the well undetected and died remains a mystery, says Omer, who runs a shop near the masjid.I came here from Delhi after my marriage. We used to grow rice and other crops in the 10-acre area. There were two stepwells which were used for irrigating the fields.

Kala of Washermanpet is not just a dog lover. She is a pet parent. Her house is like a kennel  well, actually a home  to more than 20 dogs, many of them strays from the streets. Ms. Kala takes care of not just the dogs in her house but those in the streets as well  cooking rice and chicken for them every day.On Wednesday, Ms. Kala went to Madras Veterinary College in Vepery to attend the first ever Pet Parents Meet at the hospital there. The meet was organised by Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Tanuvas) and inaugurated by its Vice-Chancellor Dr. C. Balachandran.Ms. Kala is a regular at the college hospital where she befriended V. Sumathi from Ayanavaram. Ms. Sumathi was at the meet to know more about two deadly, but preventable diseases  Paroviral Enteritis and Canine Distemper  that are common afflictions in dogs.In a land where the pronoun, it, is used to refer to children, the pet parents use he and she to refer to their pets. When their pets cry during treatment, they comfort them saying, mommy is here, dont worry, or daddy will take care, says Dr. K. Vijaya Bharathi, Assistant Professor of Madras Veterinary College, explaining why the event was called Pet Parents Meet.Regular featureThe meet was attended by nearly 50 people from all over the city. For Murali, a resident of Mahabalipuram, the meet meant an opportunity to know about appropriate methods to treat the two diseases for which Ms. Sumathi had come for. Vaccination is the sure way to prevent these diseases. Enteritis is curable with medicines whereas the prognosis is not so good for Distemper, says Dr. L. Gunaseelan, Dean of the Faculty of Basic Sciences.Doctors at the hospital say that Wednesdays meet turned out to be all about the two diseases that have been great worries to pet parents in the city. They add that such meetings would become a feature of the hospitals outreach to the pet lovers community.When Ms. Kala wanted to know the reason behind one of her dogs falling prey to Parvoviral Enteritis even after vaccination, Dr. Gunaseelan said it could be because of the failure to maintain the cold chain. Always visit a doctor to get your dog vaccinated. In your case, you may have carried the vaccine from the pharmacy to the hospital. Please note that the vaccine will not be effective, if incubation of the virus has already taken place, he said.Veterinarians explained that a few breeds like Rottweiler and Doberman might not respond to vaccination. It is also not advisable to vaccinate a pup before the schedule.Dr B. Nagarajan, Professor and Head of the Veterinary Preventive Medicine department, said the first vaccination should be given when the puppy is six weeks old and should be followed by two boosters. Some dogs may remain healthy even after missing the first schedule. But do not forget to vaccinate it on the 16th week, advised Dr. Nagarajan.Spread of diseasesDr. Gunaseelan said since the virus strains can survive in the environment for nearly a year, the afflicted dogs should be treated as in-patients to prevent the spread of the diseases, which happens through dog excreta and saliva.When their pets cry during treatment, they say, mommy is here, dont worryK.

Chandrababu Naidu and East Godavari district Collector Karthikeya Mishra said on Wednesday 37 of the 44 tribal passengers were from East Godavari and the rest from West Godavari. They said as per the data collected from the VROs, 19 bodies had been recovered including three children, 22 reached the shore safely and three were missing. However, eyewitnesses said the number of passengers died would be 28 taking the number of passengers in the boat to around 50.The stage carrier boat capsized on Tuesday evening between Vadapalli of West Godavari and Manturu on East Godavari.Fifty people died in another major capsize in 1991-92 50 at the same spot and the boat was purchased by Kaja Mohidin, the present owner who also had a few more boats. He runs a grocery shop in Devipatnam and loaded about 50 cement bags and others in the boat.It turned a Herculean task for the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) to locate the boat almost after 17 hours and took another three hours to pull it out and bring to the shore.Around 70 NDRF team members including divers and 100 SDRF teams worked throughout the day in retrieving the boat and the bodies.About 100 men pulled the boat to the shore with the help of a crane and iron ropes brought from the Polavaram project site, said Udit Kumar Dixit, an NDRF team commandant.Hundreds of tribal from Manturu rushed to Vadapalli on the other side by five to 10 boats which were arranged to transport the relatives of the kith and kin. It was a long wait for the tribals from the morning for their near and dear. They even refused to take breakfast and water as all of them were stricken with grief.When the NDRF and the SDRF teams were trying their best to retrieve the bodies, the tribals grew impatient contending that had the local swimmers been allowed to do the job, they would not have taken so long. The boat was retrieved from 40 meters depth.Vinod, a member of a rescue team, said the boat was carrying 20 rice bags, two motorcycles, a refrigerator and gas cylinders besides the cement bags. The load would have been around 40 tonnes, he added.Two NDRF teams, one each from Visakhapatnam and Mangalagiri, had been pressed into service since Wednesday morning along with two choppers from the Visakhapatnam Naval Base to support the SDRF teams which had already been on the job since Tuesday night.Pulling out the boat is not difficult if the latest equipment is with us and if the boat has not overturned, said KV Panya, another commandant of the NDRF."

Some leave with a curse, while some take it serious and retaliate, only to repent later on knowing that it is part of an age-old tradition. The devotees are considered the incarnation of, or under the influence of, the folk goddess Gangamma, whose festival is currently on in the old town.The goddess is considered the younger sister of Lord Venkateswara and hence the festival is treated with utmost sanctity. Natives of Tirupati follow the practice of smearing colours on the body and bad-mouthing.According to folklore, Gangamma is on a mission during the festival period to find out the Palegadu (local chieftain), who goes into hiding after outraging her modesty. She goes to town in different costumes every day, hurling abuses to enrage and lure him out. It is in this background the locals prefer using filthy language without any qualms, as it is considered a form of paying obeisance to the goddess. While the devout find the foul language a blessing, the senior citizens voluntarily ask the Veshagallu to use the choicest of abuses on them. Most of the words used are considered unparliamentary today, but are used with utmost devotion to appease the goddess.Science behind the fairModest upbringing and modern education make people conscious of following etiquette and maintaining decorum in public places. Emotional upheaval is the last resort of such people who consciously avoid confrontations. This leads to piling up of pent-up feelings and may cause psychological disorders in the long run. Such festivals are the time to blow the lid off their emotions, N.B. Sudhakar Reddy, state general secretary of AP Counselling Psychologists Association (APCPA) told The Hindu .As the festival falls in peak summer, the application of limestone, charcoal and vermilion paste all over the body helps avoid sunburn and blisters. Ambili (buttermilk laced with ragi rice and onion) acts as a coolant."

MoorthyG_MoorthyUncertainty looms large in many villages along Thathampatti-Manthikulam stretch, a double-crop region under Periyar canal irrigation in Madurai district, following the recent notification by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to acquire land for aRs. 700-crore Ring Road project connecting Dindigul highway (NH 44) with Tiruchi highway (NH 45B).Shocked by the notification, coupled with lack of clarity on land acquisition, those who will lose their lands have started organising themselves against the project. Apart from the key concerns of loss of fertile land, water resources and livelihood, these villagers have questioned the necessity of a greenfield project through agricultural land when the State government is also planning a Ring Road project, mainly through existing roads, to serve the same purpose.The 29.96-km-long NHAI project, which is a component of the Rs. 3,000- crore project to connect all State and National Highways branching out of Madurai, intends to decongest city roads by allowing outstation vehicles to bypass the city. The road that starts at Thathampatti, passes through Kalvelipatti, Kallanai, Valasai, Kondaiyanpatti, Karuvanur, Manthikulam and joins NH 45B at Thamaraipatti.The opponents point to the Government Order (GO) issued by Highways department in January 2018, sanctioning Rs. 30 lakh for preparing a Detailed Project Report for the Ring Road to connect the same two highways, mainly by four-laning the existing road from Nagari till Arumbanur, for about 30 km. The State government project starts at Nagari, hardly nine km south of Thathampatti. At the NH 45B-end, both the projects join more or less near the same point, said M. Muthandi of Karuvanur.According to the GO, the proposed route was chosen because of minimum land acquisition of around 40 acres at a cost of roughly Rs. 9.2 crore. The villagers contrast this with the NHAI project that requires acquisition of 526 acres.Even in this scorching summer, the lands in these parts have lush greenery. In Thathagoundanpatti, K. Karuppiah and his brothers raise horticultural crops on 15 acres throughout the year, thanks to three wells. I earn Rs. 2,000 a day from sampangi (tuberose) flower alone during season, Mr. Karuppiah says. Three acres of my land, including all the wells, will be gone. To dig a well like this will cost at least Rs. 20 lakh now and there is no certainty that I will get water. If my water sources are gone, what will I do with the remaining land?, he asks.Many others complain that they are losing all their lands. T. Suresh of Kalvelipatti has around three acres near Periyar Main Canal. I raise paddy twice a year. I am clueless about the future, he says.V. Sembayees husband and his brothers have a banana plantation on around three acres with a well in Karuvanur. My husband and his brothers are not educated. All they know is farming. We dont want compensation. We just want to retain our land, she says.Karuvanur villagers petitioned Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao on Monday last about the project passing through the Big Tank, connected to Periyar irrigation system. Though the NHAI stated that the road would not bifurcate the tank and instead a pillar-supported bridge would be constructed, the villagers are not convinced. Small streams and canals going on different sides of the canal will certainly be disturbed, said M. Kannan whose three acres and a well have been marked for acquisition.If the road is laid, the entire topography of the region will change in a few years. This double-crop region will cease to be the rice bowl of the district, he said.NHAI is misleadingC. Pugazhendhi of Manthikulam, whose familys nine cents and house are being marked for acquisition, accused the NHAI of misleading people. Along with other villagers, he alleged that the entire project and land acquisition were being done in a hush-hush manner. The gazette notification on acquisition came on April 19. However, advertisements came nine days later in an English daily and a Tamil daily. The advertisement in English says the 21-day window period to raise objections is from the date of gazette publication. So, we had already lost nine days, he said.Moreover, many would not have noticed a corrigendum published five days later, about a village name mentioned wrongly, he adds.V. Karuppasamy of Kalvelipatti said, The advertisements only gave the survey numbers and not sub-divisions. The NHAI office and office of District Revenue Officer are not forthcoming in giving details. The DRO received our objection only after insistence, but refused to give an acknowledgement, he said.V. Saravanan, Project Director, NHAI, Madurai, said the public had 21-days time from the publication of advertisement. Though the DRO is in charge of acquisition, people can also approach us for clarification, he said. Acknowledging that sub-divisions of survey numbers were not mentioned for many properties, he said the present notification was made under Section 3C of The National Highways Act. Only Section 3D notification will have complete details, he said.

When he is caught, he doesnt try to feign ignorance, refuse to admit to his offence or pretend he is not the person the police are looking for. I am Silver Srinivasan, the person you are looking for, is what he tells them.Srinivasa Raghavan says his hometown is Tirupati. He leads a peripatetic existence. He is not too ambitious and the money value of his loot is rarely high. His daily menu is four idlies in the morning, curd rice for lunch, and four idlies in the night. When he runs out of money, he strikes, typically at the houses of senior citizens. Velachery, Madipakkam and Pallikaranai are his favourite haunts.Srinivasan got caught when K. Senthilmurugan, Inspector at Mylapore police station, was investigating a theft at a house in Mylapore recently. CCTV footage showed an old man moving out from the house. When Srinivasan bumped into the police, he repeated his refrain to them but they were dismissive of his claim. At the police station, he recounted his life of crime which started when he was 14 and boasts of some 200 capers. His exploits made him a marked man in the 90s when the then Director General of Police Walter Devaram added Silver to his name due to his preference for silver items.Picking on the gullibleInspector Senthilmurugan said Srinivasan would wait outside a temple and pick on those he considered gullible. He would offer to do a ritual and ask them to keep jewellery on a bowl and close their eyes. When they opened their eyes, Srinivasan would be long gone, along with the loot.Sometimes, he would introduce himself as a distant relative of an elderly couple and gain their confidence. Claiming that his daughter was getting married, he would tell them he wanted to buy her an almirah and ask to look at the almirah in their house so he could get an idea. He would then decamp with whatever jewellery he could lay his hands on in the almirah."

Satyanarayana, in the Krishna Basin districts of AP and Telangana is wholly unscientific and illogical since there is no parity in the source of irrigation among the areas of study.Senior counsel appearing for Telangana C.S. Vaidyanathan, during Mr. Satyanarayanas cross-examination before the tribunal in New Delhi on Wednesday, was able to make the witness admit before the tribunal that in his study on average productivity of paddy in Telangana also included the average yield of crop in Ranga Reddy district, which forms part of the Krishna Basin, but does not have canal irrigation facility.Although Mr. Satyanarayana, a senior agriculture scientist and Director of AP Rice Research Station, denied the argument put forward by the Telanganas counsel, the latter explained to the tribunal that the comparison of productivity was completely erroneous. The witness said his comparison study encompasses the advantages of growing paddy between AP and Telangana districts as per the climatic suitability of paddy.Interestingly, the witness admitted during the course of cross-examination that even if variables such as soil type, soil slope, rainfall and agro-climatic suitability are constant, the yields would vary depending on the source of irrigation such as canal, dug well and tube well. Further, APs witness also admitted that yields would depend on the number of wettings and depth of irrigation, as also the economic management practices adopted.Ranga Reddy districtWhen Telanganas counsel pointed out that while the entire command area in Krishna Delta and Right and Left Canals of Nagarjunsagar were given water between 2006-07 and 2015-16 - his study period for the purpose of productivity comparison - while there was hardly any command area under canals based on Krishna river in Ranga Reddy district, Mr. Satyanarayana avoided an answer, stating that he would have to verify.He admitted that he did not segregate yield of paddy in each district based on the source of irrigation and he had taken a simple average of four districts each from Telangana and AP.Similarly, he also admitted that each of the four districts taken for yield comparison study have different extent of canal irrigation. He also avoided answering a question whether it did not occur to him that the comparison would only be scientific and logical if the yield figures and land irrigated from the same source is compared.Meanwhile, the tribunal posted the cases next hearing between July 9 and July 11, when Mr. Satyanarayanas cross-examination would resume.The study did not segregate yield of paddy in each district based on the source of irrigation and took a simple average of four districts from each State.C.

Swedes have gone on to be very active in microchipping, with scant debate about issues surrounding its use, in a country keen on new technology and where the sharing of personal information is held up as a sign of a transparent society.Ulrika Celsing, 28, is one of 3,000 Swedes to have injected a microchip into her hand to try out a new way of life. To enter her workplace, the media agency Mindshare, she simply waves her hand on a small box and types in a code before the doors open. It was fun to try something new and to see what one could use it for to make life easier in the future, she said.Sweden has a track record on the sharing of personal information, which may have helped ease the microchips acceptance among the Nordic countrys 10 million-strong population. Citizens have long accepted the sharing of their personal details, registered by the social security system, with other administrative bodies, while people can find out each others salaries through a quick phone call to the tax authority.However, for Ben Libberton, a microbiologist working for MAX IV Laboratory, in the southern city of Lund which provides X-rays for research, the danger is real. The chip implants could cause infections or reactions of the immune system, he warned.But the biggest risk, he added, was around the data contained in the chip.At the moment, the data collected and shared by implants is small, but its likely that this will increase, the researcher said.Despite unanswered questions about how the technology will progress, the appeal of being part of a futuristic experience is a strong draw for some users.At an implant party organised by Osterlund in Stockholm, Anders Brannfors, 59, was among the curious 30-something hipsters. Delighted to have become a 2.0 version of himself, he has yet to find a use for his chip weeks after the implant."

Narayanan Unni, founder of the Navara Foundation and the Navara Eco Farm at Chittur in Palakkad, claim that the variety cultivated by him on his 12-acre farm is an exclusive variety belonging to Chittur.To support his claim, Mr. Unni cites the plant genome saviour community award presented to him two years ago by the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority (PPVFRA).Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar on Sunday said the ownership rights of the Navara rice variety was with the farming community of Kerala and the government had informed the PPVFRA against conferring the IP rights on Mr. Unni. The rice is being cultivated by farmers across Kerala. A seed bank to conserve such seeds will be established by the government soon, he said.Mr. Unni refuted reports that he was attempting to wrest IP rights of the rice variety. What I grow in my field is a unique variety and I do not have any plan to usurp the rights of the government or any other farmer for cultivating and promoting Navara in general. In 2004, I formed a Navara rice farming society with 20 farmers and got entry for it in the Geographical Indication (GI) registry under the Geographical Indication of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999, he said.However, KAU sources said Navara was cultivated in eight districts and the university would fight attempts to end community rights over the preservation, protection, and promotion of the seed. This medicinal rice variety was almost extinct when I took up its cultivation. Non-availability of pure seeds, low yield, and high production costs deterred farmers from taking up cultivation of the rice variety, Mr Unni, who has been running his farm for the past 20 years, said.Unlike other rice varieties that are white in colour, Navara is deep red and has been cultivated for more than 2,000 years."

We are showing that global warming, climate change and particularly greenhouse gases  carbon dioxide  can have an impact on the nutrient content of plants we eat, said co-author Adam Drewnowski, a professor at the University of Washington.This can have devastating effects on the rice-consuming countries where about 70% of the calories and most of the nutrients come from rice. Protein and vitamin deficiencies can lead to growth-stunting, birth defects, diarrhoea, infections and early death.Risk factorsCountries at most risk include those that consume the most rice and have the lowest gross domestic product (GDP), such as Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, Mr. Drewnowksi said.The findings were based on field studies in Japan and China, simulating the amount of CO2 expected in the atmosphere by the second half of this century  568 to 590 parts per million. Current levels are just over 400 ppm.For the experiments, 18 different strains of rice were planted in open fields, surrounded in certain areas by 56-foot wide octagons of plastic piping that released extra CO2.According to study co-author Kazuhiko Kobayashi, a professor at the University of Tokyo, the experiment is designed to be more accurate than growing in a greenhouse.This technique allows us to test the effects of higher carbon dioxide concentrations on plants growing in the same conditions that farmers really will grow them some decades later in this century, said co-author Kazuhiko Kobayashi.Researchers found that iron, zinc, protein, and vitamins B1, B2, B5, and B9  which help the body convert food to energy  were all reduced in the rice grown under higher CO2 conditions. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) levels decreased by 17.1%; average Vitamin B2 by 16.6%; average Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) by 12.7%; and average Vitamin B9 (folate) by 30.3%, said the report.The reasons for the changes have to do with how higher CO2 affects the plant's structure and growth, increasing carbohydrate content and reducing protein and minerals, said the study."

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will release the new varieties at a function at the KAU on Saturday.Rice varietiesThe rice varieties are Pournami, Manu Ratna, Lavanya, Jyothsana, Supriya and Akshaya. Pournami is a semi-tall, medium-duration (115-120 days) non-lodging medium bold red-kernelled variety developed by S. Leena Kumary and her team at the Rice Research Station (RRS), Moncompu.Manu Ratna, developed at the Agriculture Research Station (ARS), Mannuthy, by A. Latha, is tolerant to stem borer, leaf folder and whorl maggot, and suitable for normal wetlands of Kerala, including kole land.Lavanya and Jyotsna are varieties suitable for the coastal saline agro ecosystem, developed at the RRS, Vyttila, by a team led by K.S. Shylaraj. Supriya is a tall and late-maturing (140 days) variety developed at RARS (Regional Agriculture Research Station), Pattambi, by K. Kartthikeyan and team. It is moderately resistant to stem borer, leaf folder, whorl maggot and blast. Akshaya, also from RARS, Pattambi, developed by a team led by Ilangovan, is a long-duration variety resistant to stem borer, leaf folder, whorl maggot and blast disease. Both Pattambi varieties are suited for irrigated or rainfed wetlands.The culinary melon Vishal, developed by I. Sreelatha Kumary and colleagues at College of Agriculture (CoA), Vellayani, is suitable for warm humid tropics of Kerala. The seedless cucumber hybrid KPCH-1 is suitable for poly house cultivation. The early maturing variety was developed by T. Pradeep Kumar at College of Horticulture, Vellanikkara.Manjari, the yard long bean developed by Manoj Sebastian and team at RARS, Kumarakom, is ideal for intercropping. Mithra, the other yard long variety was developed at the ARS, Thiruvalla by Beena Thomas and colleagues.TapiocaThe tapioca variety Uthama developed by Sajeena A. and team at the ARS, Thiruvalla, has cylindrical tubers with light brown skin and white flesh. Nithya, the garcinia variety from RARS, Kumarakom, is suitable for loamy and laterite soils.The cardamom varieties PV 3 and PV 5 were developed at the CRS, Pampadumpara, by teams led by Dhanya M.K. and Maya T. respectively. PV3 is a Malabar type and tolerant to drought and moderately tolerant to capsule borer. PV5, a vazhukka type, is tolerant to thrips and suitable for cardamom growing tracts of Kerala.Panniyur 9, developed by Ajith M. and team, is the latest in the famous Panniyur variety chain from PRS, Panniyur, and is tolerant to quick wilt and drought. The ginger varieties Chandra and Chithra were developed by scientists at CoH, Vellanikkara. Both are suitable for moist humus rich soils.Nutmeg varieties Pullan, Kochukudy, Mundathanam, Poothara and Punnathanam are clonal selections from farmers fields in Palakkad, Thrissur, Idukki, Kottayam and Ernakulam districts identified by N.

But farmers say they get only Rs. 1,550 a quintal in the open market. The spot price of the Matta variety was Rs. 1,550 to Rs. 1,600 a quintal at the Meenangadi market on Friday against the Rs. 1,950 a quintal a few weeks ago. It reached up to Rs. 2,200 a quintal four months ago.Though Supplyco had started paddy procurement in the district recently, only cleaned paddy with less than 17% moisture content was being procured, farmers say.I spent Rs. 30,000 to cultivate paddy on an acre and I got 17 quintals after the harvest, Viswanathan, a farmer at Panamaram said. Now he is forced to sell the produce at a throwaway price to pay workers wages. It is sad that we are forced to sell our produce at such a low price, says Kesavan Keezhanikkal, another farmer.Usually the sale of hay helps farmers recoup the expenditure. Last season, Kesavan had sold hay for Rs. 6,000.

Mohammed Y. Safirulla.20 tonnes firstThe plan is to market some 20 tonnes of rice initially, followed by another batch of 20 tonnes. Keecheri Service Cooperative Bank has completed collection of paddy, threshing, packing, and branding, said a release issued here.Mr. Safirulla sought the support of Amballoor and Edakkattuvayal panchayats to cultivate some 350 acres of the 990 acres of the Puncha in Ernakulam district (the remaining 1,082 acres are in Kottayam) in 2016-17, and the results were stunning.Preparation of fields itself was a challenge, but paddy field collectives worked in tandem to make it happen. This time around, we were able to bring under cultivation the maximum cultivable area  around 700 acres over nine paddy land collectives barring areas acquired for various projects, canals, farm roads, and irrigation channels, said C.K. Prakash, general coordinator of the project.Several departments, including irrigation, Land Development Corporation, and the State Electricity Board, supported the initiative. The canals were cleaned, and pumping facility was added to the sluices at Olippuram and Pulimukham (as a chunk of the Puncha being in low-lying areas will get heavily inundated during the monsoon).It posed some challenges, as not every area could be cultivated in October, which delayed harvesting too. We have now set up 12 high-power submersible pumps along the Puncha for de-watering, which will help us harvest the entire field by March next. This is going to drastically reduce the harvesting cost as well. And, the idea is to incorporate Kudumbasree in threshing paddy at our own mill and brand it, said Mr. Prakash.Mill to be set upA Thottara Puncha Development Council will soon be formed, and a mill will be set up at a cost of Rs. 40 lakh. Terming it his pet project, Mr. Safirulla said all agencies and stakeholders had chipped in with verve to script the success story."

Banana, jack fruit, and pineapple occupy a lions share of the produce. Other than these, farmers also cultivate pepper, tamarind and paddy on a large area.Pepper and tamarind are sold at the local markets situated in various parts of Namakkal and Salem districts. Traders from the western belt make a beeline to the tribal villages regularly for procuring tamarind and other fruits directly from the farms.The paddy farmers are involved in raising double crop every farm season. They adopt conventional agricultural practices. They convert the paddy into rice by adopting the age-old manual practice (Kaikutthal arisi). None of the tribal farmers market paddy or rice produce, as it is chiefly meant for their domestic consumption.The land holding of each tribal farmer is very limited and hence the production is so meagre that it is just sufficient to meet his personal consumption needs. The maximum area of individual holding does not exceed 3.5 acres.With hills experiencing timely widespread rainfall during the last farm season, the realisation of water has enriched paddy growth and tribal farmers are happy over the reasonably good yield and also its quality.The major sources of irrigation are the farm wells and the local streams flowing on the hills.A cross section of the farmers of Ariyurnaadu tribal village say they do not apply chemical fertilizers, thereby maintaining the fertility of the soil in good condition down the generations. Farm machinery such as ploughing and harvesting equipment are yet to reach these villages.We are content with what we achieve by adopting the traditional methods, the farmers say with a sense of satisfaction."

If Panniyur 9 promotes pepper cultivation and brings prosperity for the farmers, the effort of those who developed it would be rewarded and society will be benefited. If not, it will be meaningless, the Chief Minister said.The Chief Minister said the objectives of the new agri-biodiversity conservation project, which envisages protection and conservation of all indigenous rice varieties, were noble.Tech developmentMinister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar, in his presidential address, said that strengthening the cooperation between the KAU and Department of Agriculture is a priority agenda pursued in earnest. The KAU is a source of technology development, which should be complimented by the department by taking it forward to the target group. The government is committed to regaining agricultural glory of the State and no stone would be left unturned, he said.Minister for Industries A.C. Moideen said the Industries Department is looking forward to all possibilities of developing agriculture-related business enterprises. Value addition and processing will be encouraged.KAU Vice Chancellor R. Chandrababu promised technology backup for all programmes initiated by the government.Chief Minister handed over the new varieties to Cheruvayal Raman, a traditional farmer from Wayanad. The farmers who won national awards for protection of varieties and scientists who developed new varieties were honoured at the function."

RICE would also help to develop rural informatics models on specific domains and sectors of natural resources, physical resources and human resources, as per the time requirement and again modify it according to rising demands of the region and nation, he said.It has also been designed to conduct training programmes and workshops for the planners, administrators and scientists on rural informatics and offer courses on GIS for the aspiring students, he added.Prof Subbiah said the Rural Informatics models will have special and advanced options to call and download all the information from the computer on all the themes either for a village or a block or a taluk or for the whole district or on a particular theme in pictorial, statistical and tabular formats. Similarly disasters vulnerability and environmental status from the village to district levels can be retrieved. In the same way, all the physical resources such as rural housing, electricity, health, education and agriculture could be retrieved spontaneously from the computer, he said.In the same way, data on the population and demography and the issues of different age segment of the rural populace, issues related to women, status of women empowerment, self-help group, employability and distribution of differently abled people could be retrieved from the village to district levels, he said. To start with, the Alagappa University under RICE would launch a model project on Sivaganga (Rural Informatics of Sivaganga  Project RUSI), he said.In this mission, all the possible departments from Sciences, Arts, Management and Education would be involved and students would be utilized for data collection, he added."

MoorthyR_ASHOKIt is about four in the evening and R. Karpagam, a rice mill worker, is winding up after a tireless day drying paddy. The 60-year-old woman has worked at three rice mills in Keeraithurai and has seen the area transform from an inconsequential village to south Tamil Nadus bustling hub of packaged rice production.Keeraithurai and Chinthamani were once remote areas that were disconnected from the city. The first rice mills of Madurai were located on Kamarajar Salai. For want of space, everyone moved to Keeraithurai. My mother used to dry paddy at a mill. Her day began at 8 a.m. and she clocked a 12-hour shift. I learnt the work from her and started working when I was 14. The mills provide women a chance to earn some money though the work is hard, she says.For many like her, the traditional rice mill is their home away from home. Keeraithurai and Chinthamani areas used to have about 120 rice mills till five years ago. About 40 women worked in yards, husking, destoning, boiling and drying paddy. Some others worked on hulling machines. The output of each mill was only 8 to 10 tonnes. Now, a modern rice mill produces 30 tonnes effortlessly.Rice mill jobs are no more of interest to women these days. They are more interested in either studies or working in shops. Even the number of rice mills has reduced to about 100 now. Only about 60 are functioning and half of them are raking profits, Ms. Karpagam says.These mills supply rice to the whole of south Tamil Nadu. About 5% of the production heads to the north and west of the State. Some mills have started supplying rice to Kerala.Tireless workhorsesK. Rajendran, secretary of Rice Mill Owners Association and owner of Malligai Mill, says the industry is growing but in an isolated manner. He says the fall in number of mills can be traced to five years ago, with the advent of automation. The need for manpower has dropped considerably because the sophisticated machines perform the work so fast. The output has tripled now, he says.According to him, setting up a rice mill requires a minimum capital of Rs. 6 crore and about three acres of land. The machines perform all the functions such as pre-cleaning, soaking, cooking, drying, grinding, grading and packing.Workers are needed only for loading and unloading the machines and taking charge of odd jobs. But not all mills could make the transition, owing to cost and other factors. With their traditional machines, they sell unbranded rice to local retail stores. The modern mills are far more profitable than the traditional ones, says Mr. Rajendran.Rice production has dropped significantly in the south of the State because of depleting water sources. With storage level in Periyar dam yet to be restored to its full capacity, farmers sow only 100-days paddy varieties, instead of 150-days varieties. And they do not produce paddy of good quality and sell the produce to the highest bidder. We lag behind other States in the quality front, he says.T.N. buys rice from A.P.The State government refuses to buy rice from mills in Tamil Nadu for its flagship rice scheme and instead buys it from Andhra Pradesh as it is cheaper there, he says.K. Anandavel, joint secretary of the association, says levy of 5% GST on branded rice has affected the industry. The resultant high prices have proved detrimental to branded rice producers because people are very conscious of price. The government made the move keeping branded basmati rice producers in mind.The middle class, which buys branded rice, is switching over to unbranded varieties because they are cheaper, he says.All these factors have stopped new entrants from entering the rice mill business. The present generation looks for a stable business, he adds.Family businesses can continue to co-exist; competition will be healthy and mills can continue to provide employment to more people. Policy-level changes will make all the difference, says Mr. Anandavel.The State government can help the industry with subsidies and support.Currently, the mills have a power cap of 112 KW a day. If it is raised to 200 KW, it will boost production. If the Tamil Nadu government buys rice from within the State, home-grown industries will thrive.Additional subsidies for automation will help small-scale mills, these association functionaries say.Machines perform the work so fast that the output has tripled nowK.

Narasimhan from whom he received the prize. It is made of paper. You can use it as a normal disposable pen, and when the ink is exhausted, you can just throw it away. It contains a seed, which will give birth to a tree in future, he explained.Making seed pens is more like a hobby for Mr. Shaji, whose major occupation is conserving tuber species.Started 20 years ago as a response to the drought conditions in Wayanad district where he lives, his passion has taken him places across the country, in search of newer tuber species. I have a collection of 200 edible tuber species, including the rarest ones, besides herbs and medicinal plants on my four-acre land, he says proudly.He has shared the germplasm of the tubers with institutions such as Central Tuber Crop Research Institute and Kerala University.Recipient of many awards, including National Plant Genome Saviour Award, Mr. Shajis conservation efforts are not limited to tubers; they extend to rice. He grows 17 traditional varieties of rice on the meagre plot, besides dabbling in fish farming, bee keeping and horticulture.There were nine winners and 13 special mentions in total at the biodiversity award ceremony, among whom two were from Telangana.Sangham Women Farmers Group from Medak won the award for Sustainable use of Biological Resources for its efforts in traditional and organic methods of seed processing.The Biodiversity Management Committee of Modi (Jheri) village of Kerameri mandal in Asifabad district won under special mention category, for conserving 26 native varieties of pulses and cereals. Among them, two varieties Erra Machala Kandulu (a variety of pigeon pea) and Vayunowka Jonna (a variety of sorghum) have been registered with the Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority of India, while the recognition of another variety, Balintha Pesalu, is under way.Singchung Bugun Village Community Reserve Management Committee from West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh won the award for protecting the community reserve, while Lemsachenlok Organization ( Y.NukuluPhom), Longleng, Nagaland, received it in the Institutions category.Awards were also given under Special Mention category to corporates such as Godrej & Boyce, Mumbai, and Coromandel International, Kakinada.

However, the ten farmers do not belong here, say the villagers.The lorries did not transport the load nor did the paddy in question ever exist in reality, an inspection report by the Area Coordinator says.It was learnt that the officials at the IKP centre produced truck sheets without procuring paddy.The sheets were acknowledged by the designated rice mill owners, who were offered 2% commission by the officials.The payments into the farmers accounts were approved by the District Manager, Civil Supplies Corporation. Numbers on the sheets with mill owners and those fed into tablets also show discrepancies, including repetitions, mismatches in bill numbers and farmers names.Book-keeper suspendedResponding to the issue, District Rural Development Officer R. Anjaiah said the one-month-old issue had already been resolved. He stated that a village book-keeper and marketing community resource persons were suspended for not following procedures.Neither was there a diversion of government money, nor a fraud committed. Paddy procurement took place, the truck sheets were written, and money was deposited in farmers accounts after paddy loads reached the mill, he said.CollusionOther officials in the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) and District Civil Supplies Office, however, believe that the whole episode is being covered up. They believe that it would not have been possible without the collusion of senior officials and mill owners.The book-keeper is made a scapegoat, an official, requesting anonymity, said."

Every home in Birgaon actually has power, thanks to a solar microgrid set up in the village centre and wired into every home.By government definition, a village is electrified if 10% of its homes have a power connection. This means that while all its villages are officially electrified, 42% of Jharkhand households  the highest in the country  do not have power, yet. Now, the State government is mulling a new policy, encouraging solar microgrids, even in villages that are already connected to the traditional grid.Powering changeBirgaon is proof of change. This tiny tribal hamlet  home to about 100 people in 20 households  lies in the hilly Gumla District of Jharkhand. It is one of the 249 remote villages which got solar microgrids last year, thanks to a Rs. 110-crore project by the Jharkhand Renewable Energy Agency (JREDA), as part of the Centres Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana. Private solar provider Azure Power won the bid to build and maintain microgrids in 11 villages in Gumla and Hazaribagh districts.The 20 photovoltaic panels glint in the scorching sun, out of place amid the old mud houses of Birgaon. Power lines snake out of a shed which stores the batteries and inverter.We are on the elephant route to the Basa river and they rampage through the village, mostly before harvest, says Srisai Kawar, the villager who donated the land on which the microgrid stands. A few street lights dot the common areas of the village, while each home has three LED bulbs and two power sockets. We havent had any elephant attacks since the light came, he adds.For most of the 25 children at the local primary school the arrival of electricity means they can occasionally watch films on the villages only television. For Dahari Kawal, a Class 6 student, it allows her to study at night, leaving the day for other chores. She hopes to continue her education at a high school in a bigger village five km away. I want to become a teacher, she says.With free power, villagers save Rs. 200 to Rs. 300 per month otherwise spent on kerosene. They are willing to pay the nominal tariff of Rs. 30 per month.The only wayWhen Azure Powers deputy manager Bikash Kumar first reached Birgaon after a 200-km journey from Ranchi, he was appalled by the last stretch. I wasnt sure how we would get the components of the grid over that bumpy track, he says. To exacerbate, to reach Hisir, another project village, Azure was forced to build a five-km road through dense jungles and across three rivers. These kinds of villages will be almost impossible to reach with regular transmission lines. Microgrids are the only way, he says.JREDA director Niranjan Kumar has bigger plans. We are coming out with a new solar microgrid policy in a month. People want quality, 24/7 power. If a microgrid can provide that, they are willing to pay, Mr. Kumar adds. He cites a pilot project where 10 villages are paying up to Rs. 10 per unit for solar microgrids that power small enterprises: rice hullers, oil extractors, wheat mills and poultry farms.When the government says that all villages are electrified, its not really true, says Gabriel Pujur, pradhan of Galu, another electrified village.He points to Pakartoli, a village on the governments electrified list, where only 21 out of the 114 households actually have power according to government data."

Of several small-scale industries, appalam business is very vibrant, says G. Thirumurugan, owner of Madurai Pandian Appalam, who is also president of Tamil Nadu Appalam, Vathal, Vadagam Association.There was a stage when the humble rice/black gram discs were accompaniments to a large meal served especially during weddings and special occasions. Now, the crunchy item is unmissable at homes as it is easy to procure and process with minimal effort.This summer, Mr. Thirumurugan says that production has increased significantly. Pockets of Madurai, particularly Chinthamani, Anuppanadi, Keeraithurai, Villapuram and Jaihindpuram, produce over 70% of Tamil Nadus needs. Almost every household has an appalam making machine, a grinder and stacks of rice flour and black gram (urad dal or ulundhu ).The appalams are sold all over the country and also exported. Mr. Thirumurugan says that his company regularly ships products to South East Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Mauritius, Singapore and Malaysia. Each importer places a minimum order of 10 tonnes with us. The high returns helps us plough back the money into the business in the form of machinery, he says.S. Karthi, a worker at Sri Vignesh Appalam Company in Chinna Anuppanadi says that production has gone up to 1.7 to three tonnes a day. Many workers flock to the industry on contract basis during summer because it pays anywhere between Rs. 250 and Rs. 500 for 10 hours of work a day.Women, who constitute 90% of the industrys workforce, take the effort to grind the dough using black gram flour, oil and a bit of sodium bicarbonate for the fluffiness when the appalam hits the oil. They divide the dough into sheets, put them through a machine that cuts the sheets into circles based on size and then dab them with rice flour so that they do not stick. The circles are stacked tightly for about three hours and later left to dry. The harsh summers of Madurai are a boon for the industry. The appalams dry within half an hour and are re-stacked, packaged and stored in large boxes.The highest sale happens during monsoon when a large number of weddings take place. People have even begun getting their faces, names and initials printed on it personalisation, he says.We ship products to Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Mauritius, Singapore and MalaysiaG.

While BJP wants Prime Minister Narendra Modis photo at ration shops as the free rice given to the poor is highly subsidized by the Centre, the ruling Congress argues the scheme was implemented before Modi became PM.The programme, which seeks to make Karnataka a hunger-free state by supplying free rice to the poor, has triggered a verbal showdown between the two parties on the political turf. While chief minister Siddaramaiah has made Anna Bhagya the most important weapon in his election arsenal, BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa is attempting to neutralize him by terming it a fortune bestowed by Modi.Yeddyurappas argument is that the Centre procures rice at Rs 32.64 per kg and supplies it to the state government at Rs 3 per kg; the subsidy being borne by the Centre is a whopping Rs 29.64 per kg. The Siddaramaiah government only pays Rs 3 per kg and boasts of supplying free rice while it is the Centre which is actually bearing the massive cost, Yeddyurappa pointed out in the last few political rallies he addressed. In Hubballi recently, Yeddyurappa directed party workers to ensure that Modis photographs are put up in front of local ration shops. Tell everyone that Anna Bhagya is actually Modis programme, he told them.The Congress, however, has not remained mute. The very fact that BJP is trying to hijack the Anna Bhagya programme points to the partys desperation and speaks about the popularity of the food security programme introduced by chief minister Siddaramaiah, food minister U T Khader told TOI. Interestingly, BJP leaders had described Anna Bhagya as Kanna Bhagya (robbers fortune) when it was announced immediately after Siddaramaiah assumed office in 2013.BJPs claim smacks of hypocrisy, said Khader, adding: Why has the programme not been implemented in any of the BJP-ruled states, including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra? He maintained Anna Bhagya was announced by Siddaramaiah before Modi became PM and before the National Food Security Act-2013 (also known as Right to Food Act) came into effect.Another Congress leader said BJP has started harping on Anna Bhagya since it is popular among the rural population, especially people from North Karnataka who were being forced to migrate to urban centres during drought. Moreover, BJP is not doing any favour by claiming to give subsidy. In fact, the Right to Food Act mandates that a poor person be given 5kgs of free rice per month and other food grains at subsidized rates. But we have gone a step ahead and are providing 7kgs of rice per person and the cost of the additional two kgs is borne by the state government, Khader said.To back its claim, BJP has started a social media campaign saying the Modi government has given funds to the tune of Rs 24,107 crore for rice being supplied under Anna Bhagya, while the Siddaramaiah governments contribution is a paltry Rs 2,994 crore.Anna Bhagya: Food security for poorAnna Bhagya, which aims to eradicate hunger, provides food security to 1.08 crore families (covering nearly four crore people) across the state. Each beneficiary is entitled to 7kgs of rice and 1kg of wheat free of cost. Cooking oil is given at a highly subsidized price of Rs 25 per litre and iodised salt at Rs 2 per packet. The programme also provides 1kg of dal per BPL family."

However, the funds with each of the departments for 2017-18 have not been utilised to the optimum, owing to slow application and resolution process, welfare officials in different departments complained. About 25% of applications last year in some schemes under the BC Welfare Department and SC Development Department were transferred to this financial year. Clearing backlog has been a task, said a senior secretary.By March-2018 the departments will cover the backlog, the official said. Kalyana Laxmi is among successful schemes in the department, he added. However, some departments including Women and Child Welfare Department have spent over half the funds allocated to them, reaching about 45 percent of the intended beneficiaries.

The move could resolve the areas nutrition-related concerns apart from ensuring a steady supply to buyers from outside.Hardly four months after the Agriculture Department initiated a mega millet cultivation drive on 1,287.5 acres with the involvement of the SC/ST Welfare Department, a bumper harvest is now on the cards for 900 tribal families from 45 settlements. The harvest will begin in 45 days.The project, titled Millet Village, was initiated in September in the presence of Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar and is now showing signs of success. According to Agriculture Department officials, the project could revive some of the rare millet varieties which had disappeared from Attappadys tribal menu because of poor patronage. The first phase was implemented at a cost of Rs. 55 lakh and it would soon be extended to more areas.The pesticide-free millets would be sold in the open market under the name Attappady.The tribal hamlets in Attappady had refrained from cultivating millets in the past few years. This could be a reason for the poverty and malnutrition that haunted the hamlets.Large-scale land alienation and climate change had contributed to the shifting patterns in tribal farming practices. As a result, tribals were forced to depend on free rice made available through the public distribution system. The total absence of millets from the tribal menu had caused nutrition deficiency among tribespeople.Crops and acreageUnder the Millet Village project, finger millet was cultivated in 500 acres and fox tale millet in 100 acres. Little millet was cultivated in 50 acres while banyard millet was grown in 75 acres. Kodo millet was cultivated in 25 acres. A few varieties of pulses, cereals, and vegetables were also cultivated under the scheme. According to project special officer B. Suresh Kumar, traditional tribal pulses named red gram and lablab bean were revived under the project.The Agriculture Department is now attempting to get Geographical Indication registry entry for both.Expert adviceHyderabad-based Indian Institute of Millet Research is providing scientific support to the project. Experts from agriculture universities in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka are also advising tribespeople in this regard.According to local people, millets completely disappeared from Attappady two decades ago after agriculture became non-profitable and work on lands owned by non-tribals began to fetch more money.Bajra and maizeIn the second phase, there would be more focus on cultivation of bajra and maize. Gradually, the programme will cover all the 192 tribal settlements in the region. Apart from ensuring food security, the project is aiming at protecting seeds of traditional varieties of millets.900 tribal families from 45 settlements will benefit from project"

The parade includes several colourful flower-covered floats, and one of these will be the Sikh American float, being featured for the fourth consecutive year.The theme of the Sikh American float, langar, will evoke the Sikh teachings of Sewa (selfless service). Elaborating on this, one of the many community members involved in the project and responsible for the floats entry for the fourth year, Bhajneet Singh said: Growing up in California, it was always a dream to see a Sikh float in the Tournament of Roses Parade. The theme of Langar really speaks of the values of Sikhism and the work that we are doing to help our communities every day here in California and across the world.Indeed, the Southern California Sikh communitys actions stress on the importance of langar as they feed thousands of people across Los Angeles every month. Singh explains, From the Khalsa Food Pantry every Friday evening to the monthly barbeques and visits to Skid Row , we are constantly trying to bring langar to those most in need. We are excited as millions of Americans will learn more about this important aspect of Sikhism during the Rose Parade. The dishes include, chole, paneer, rice and gulab jamun as sweet dish.""Taking inspiration from the worlds largest free kitchen, the float wall feature brick walls, a marbled dome roof and scalloped arches to replicate those found at the Golden Temple, Amritsar.In addition to the langar theme, the float will house 90,959 flowers. There will also be 500 pounds of vegetables on the float to represent the meals found in a Langar Hall. Singh adds, Our Punjabi traditions are always an important part of the float design and will be showcased in the food, colors and riders that join the float. The float will visually transport spectators back to Punjab , the Sikh Coalition said.The Sikh design concept and initial implementation started months ago, but it is the work of hundreds of volunteers in the week leading up to January 1 that bring the float to life.Harbinder Kaur, one of the volunteer says, We are happy to take part in the parade and be a part of this celebratory occasion. It doesnt matter what colour you are, what religion you are, everybody here is with big smile and its all about love which is exciting to see.Singh explains the importance of having a Sikh American float in the Rose Parade, Sikhs have been an integral part of the American fabric for generations, but we still have a lot of work to do to educate the American public about who we are. We know this is a great way to raise awareness and reach millions of Americans. It brings the local Sikh community together and opens doors to interacting with other Rose Parade organisations that build lifelong partnerships."

At the same time, all those who are entitled to benefit from the scheme are not drawing ration that leads to the slashing of the Central share.He said that those who didnt draw ration should inform the government so that it can be diverted to people who need it.Central shareThis also helps in retaining the Central share, he said.

Tangus meaning Chinese manja or synthetic thread coated with finely-powdered glass has wreaked havoc on the cottage industry of manja -making. When I started making the manja at this very location with the same formula, I used to make about Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 every day, but now I find it difficult to make Rs. 400. I am doing it out of habit, out of passion, says Mr. Abidi as he helps his workers tie the tread to pillars to prepare for coating it with a paste of powdered glass, cooked rice and colour. The workers tie their fingers with a cloth and thread to prevent their hands getting cut while they work the thread. Earlier, there used to be 14 manja- makers employing between 10 and 12 persons for a period of four months from October and now there are only four manja- makers in Dabeerpura area, informs Mr. Abidi.The National Green Tribunals dictated ban on Chinese manja has hardly had any impact as it is easily available at most outlets.The NGT had ordered a countrywide ban on Chinese manja on July 11, 2017 asking the State governments to implement the same. The 113-page order cited the impact of the thread coated with synthetic glass on the environment as it killed birds and animals.Last year, we did an extensive campaign against Chinese manja . This year, we are planning to book cases against sellers who are stocking and selling the Chinese manja . The time for talking is over, said an anti-poaching squad official of the Forest Department."

But fewer school holidays, disquiet over Goods and Services Tax, ill-implemented ban on Chinese thread has sent the kites and manja business into a tailspin.One of the main markets in the city between Kali Kaman and Gulzar Houz has shops only on one side of the road.Usually, both sides of the road used to have shops by this time, but the business is dull and there are hardly any buyers. I am expecting the business to change from tomorrow as it is a Sunday and more children will come and buy the kites. Earlier, the vacation period used to be long, but now its only for two or four days. Maybe thats the reason for the lack of interest in flying kites, says Moiz Khan, who has set up a makeshift shop near Kali Kaman.Inside the colourfully-decorated Bajaj Patang Ghar of Bhuvan Bajaj, kites made of thin plastic sheets are covered with political messages while kitschy movie themes dominate. But its the kites made of thin colourful paper that get a pride of place. I have even made small curios with kites, charkas which people can keep at home. People are showing interest and are buying these, but there are a few takers for kites, says Mr. Bajaj.We have a small mulgi (workspace) at Yakutpura where these kites are made. Not the big factories like they have in Gujarat, Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh. It is a year-round enterprise. But the last two years have been bad. While demonetisation killed the business last year, we dont even know why it has been affected this year. Not many children are seen buying the kites. Children from as far as Tarnaka, Secunderabad and Bowenpally would come and buy from us. But this year, there are no shoppers, says Muhammad Azhar, who has opened a kite shop, but drives an auto-rickshaw in his spare time."

A palm full of these nuts a day could help reduce blood pressure and improve the level of good cholesterol, a new study has found.The findings, published recently in peer-reviewed Journal of Nutrition, is based on a study of 300 people in Chennai with type-2 diabetes. Half of them were asked to consume 30 grams of unsalted, raw, broken cashew nuts a day. At the end of three months, various parameters were studied: their blood pressure  usually high among those with diabetes  had dropped by 5mm. Their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, dubbed the good cholesterol, had increased by 2 milligram. There was no deleterious effect on the body weight or sugar levels.While studies across the world have shown the benefits of other nuts like almonds and walnuts, little has been done on cashews  considered a rich nut that adds flavor (and fat) to Indian curries and sweets.Nuts are rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA)  the good fats. Current Indian diets are high on carbohydrates  derived largely from polished rice and refined wheat  which account for 64% of total energy intake, and low on MUFAs, which provide just 7-8% of the total energy. The recommended intake is 15-20%.Dr V Mohan of Madras diabetes research foundation and lead author of the study said unlike other nuts, cashew has higher amount of saturated fats  the bad fats found in oily food, ghee and meat.Around 20% of the fat in cashew nut is of the saturated variety. We wanted to check if this type of saturated fat has an impact on cholesterol. It didnt, said Dr Mohan. He, however, cautioned that these nuts are beneficial only if taken in their raw form and not when added with salt and other spices, fried or roasted.Both the study groups were advised to follow, in addition to their medication, a standard diabetic diet of 1,400 calories, with 6065% of energy coming from carbohydrates, 1525% from fat, and the rest from protein. One half, who were asked to take 30 grams of cashew nuts a day either as a mid-morning or evening snack, had to reduce their carbohydrates intake to make the comparison even. Biochemical tests were done in both groups to ensure they followed the diet and the nuts were consumed.Participants in the intervention group (those who were given cashew nuts) had a 1.9-fold greater reduction in blood pressure compared to participants in the other group. Those in the former group also had a 16-fold greater increase in HDL cholesterol compared to the others.Past studies have also shown that including nuts in breakfast could improve satiety and reduce second meal consumption in adults. Researchers also found that every 100 grams of cashew nuts have 20 grams of proteins.This is crucial as Indians are traditionally low on proteins because of high vegetarian intake, said Dr Mohan.The study is significant as past research has found that nearly 80% of Asian Indian adults have dyslipidemia, largely driven by low HDL cholesterol concentrations. Among those with type-2 diabetes, 86% of males and 98% of females have been shown to have dyslipidemia.The study was funded by the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India and supported by the ministry of commerce. Dr Mohan, however, denied the council had any influence over their research. We had asked them to be prepared for both scenarios  where the end effect is beneficial or detrimental. Other authors of the study were from Harvard T Chan School of Public Health and Instituto de Salud Carlos III in Spain.India is one of the largest growers, consumers and exporters of cashew nuts. Excluding groundnuts, cashew nuts are more affordable compared to other nuts like walnuts. The nuts are grown mainly in the south and western states of Karnataka, Kerala, Goa and Maharashtra.The findings of the study arent surprising, considering recent studies have shown the benefits of fat, said Dr B Sesikeran, former director of the National Institute of Nutrition.People in the Mediterranean belt, for example, have the lowest incidence of coronary heart disease as their diet is rich in nuts, he said, adding that studies have shown that all nuts that grow on trees, like almonds, walnuts and pistachios did not increase body weight. But this has to be taken in measured quantity, he said."

He said Rangasamy had no moral right to criticise the functioning of the Congress government in Puducherry and challenged him to an open debate in this regard.Narayanasamy opined that the administrative mismanagement of the previous AINRC regime had spelt doom for the Union territory. He (Rangasamy) suffers from amnesia. He was the chief minister for 12 long years. He appointed several employees through the back door in all public sector units, thus causing huge losses to the PSUs. We have formed a committee to probe the issue, Narayanasamy said.He alleged that Rangasamy diverted funds from one head to the other to implement unwarranted programmes and projects leading to financial irregularities. The previous government did not disburse old age and widow pensions for more than eight or nine months and also failed to distribute free rice through the fair price shops during its regime, he said, adding that the Congress government had streamlined the financial position and resumed pension disbursement and free rice distribution."

After a marathon hearing on September 20, 2017, a three-judge bench of the SC reserved its verdict on the appeals filed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala against the 2007 award of the CWDT.Here is the dispute explained in 10 points:The Cauvery river originates in Karnataka's Kodagu district, flows into Tamil Nadu, reaches the Bay of Bengal at Poompuhar. Parts of three Indian states - Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka - and the Union Territory of Pondicherry lie in the Cauvery basin.The legal dispute over the waters of the Cauvery has a long history, and has its origins in agreements signed in 1892 and 1924 between the erstwhile princely state of Mysore and the Madras Presidency. The Centre constituted the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) in 1990 to resolve the dispute following a Supreme Court order. The tribunal gave Tamil Nadu 205 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) in an interim order in 1991.In 2007, the tribunal declared its final award, in which it said Tamil Nadu should receive 419 tmcft of water, more than double of the interim order. Karnataka wasn't pleased. The award required Karnataka to release 192 tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu in ten monthly instalments every year. The Centre made the notification of the award public only in 2013, after the Supreme Court ordered it do so.Before the 2007 order, Tamil Nadu had asked for 562 tmcft - roughly three-fourths of the water available in the Cauvery basin - and Karnataka had asked for 465 tmcft - around two-thirds of the available water.The Tamil Nadu government sought the SC's intervention, saying that there was a deficit of 50.0052 tmcft of water released from Karnataka's reservoirs, with respect to the minimum limit prescribed by the CDWT. Tamil Nadu claimed the tribunal's award was erroneous as the allocation of water was based on cultivation of just one crop. It contended that two crops are cultivated in the state. The state said its farmers needed more water to begin cultivating samba - a kind of rice grown in the state. The Karnataka government responded by saying it wouldn't be able to release any more Cauvery water, as low rainfall during the monsoon had left its reservoirs half-empty.On September 5, the SC ordered Karnataka to release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu every day for 10 days. A day later, Karnataka's Mandya, Mysuru and Hassan districts witnessed intense and often violent protests. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said his government would have to release the water, but with ""a heavy heart"". He added the state would file a petition in the SC seeking modification of the order.On September 20, the SC reserved its verdict on the appeals filed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala against the 2007 award of the CWDT, after a marathon hearingOn January 9 this year, the SC indicated it would deliver within a month its verdict on the decades-old Cauvery water dispute , saying enough confusion has been created on it for over two decades. The top court also said that no forum could touch the matter relating to the Cauvery basin, until it gave its verdict.The court's remark came during the hearing of a plea filed in 2016 after the violence in Mandya, by a citizens' group, Bangalore Political Action Committee, led by philanthropist Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, seeking its intervention for supply of drinking water to residents of Bengaluru and surrounding districts. They told the court that citizens of Bengaluru need adequate drinking water and their right to life needed to be protected by the top court. The plea said, ""the reservoir levels in the major reservoirs of the Cauvery basin in Karnataka, which have a huge shortfall of inflows, and thereby the drastic decrease in the storage capacities of the respective reservoirs."" If further releases are made to Tamil Nadu, there would not be enough water available in these reservoirs for supply to the citizens of Bengaluru and other towns, the plea added.Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami's appeal to immediately release 7 tmcft of Cauvery water was turned down by Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah.""After reserving the minimum needs of drinking water supply and perennial crops, Karnataka can release at least 15 tmcft of water that is crucial for the standing crops in the Cauvery delta,"" said Palaniswami in a letter to Karnataka, explaining why the state needed water.Karnataka said, ""no"".""How can we release water when storage levels in our reservoirs in the Cauvery river basin are low? There is no question of releasing water now,"" chief minister Siddaramaiah told reporters in New Delhi. He also referred to the impending SC verdict on the Cauvery water sharing row and stated that the state government will prefer to wait for the verdict.Mandya district police recently launched a ""mass contact programme"" with farmers and Kannada groups, urging them not to take the law in their hands over the Cauvery dispute . Police held talks with farmers and sought the help of their leaders to ensure law and order is maintained.""There is an acute drinking water problem in the city of Bengaluru and certain other districts of South Karnataka. The annual requirement of Bengaluru city alone is more than 19 TMC of water to be supplied to the citizens by the authorities of the State of Karnataka. The annual drinking water requirements of the Cauvery basin districts including the Bengaluru is roughly about 26 TMC (approximately),"" it said.(With inputs from Agencies)"

When prices of other crops fall below MSP, the government operationalizes the Price Support Scheme (PSS) under which funds are given to states for procurement at a support price. There is also a price stabilization fund which is used to create buffer stock of pulses."

However, disbursal of this amount has been delayed due to poor awareness among officials and protracted court proceeding.Under the scheme, the Centre will bear the burden of finiancial rehabilitation assistance fully. However, data accessed by TOI shows that of the 1,500 labourers rescued since the new scheme was introduced, no labourer has been given the full compensation. At least 170 cases are pending in various district courts.K Krishnan, executive director of Adivasi Solidarity Council, said even the initial relief amount is disbursed only in some cases. Under the scheme, they get an initial amount of Rs 20,000, and the balance is given after a district magistrate is convinced they were bonded labourers, he said.

They have to keep everything ready before 8.30 am-9 am, when the dabbawalas come to collect the tiffins for delivery.Damyanti and Pradeep were devastated with the death of their only son Nimesh Tanna, who was hit by a train in 2011. They embarked on pilgrimages across the country to overcome the loss. But one-and-a-half-years of grieving did not dull the anguish of the loss. Thats when she made up her mind to help those who were alone and in distress. We realised that we had to look within for consolation and comfort, rather than search for it elsewhere, she says.Damyanti and her friends got together and began to cook meals and deliver tiffins to senior citizens daily. Her husband supported her endeavour. They set up a charitable trust in 2013, which feeds over 110 senior citizens daily. She, now, finds a sense of fulfillment in serving the senior citizens. The senior citizens are such a grateful bunch. They keep blessing my son Nimesh, as I feed them in his name. Most of them are not aware that he is no more. I just want to see these old couples happy, so I dont reveal much, she says.Theres another reason that spurs her on in her mission. Nimesh was socially inclined and would help people in need. This organisation is a way to pay tribute to him and help the needy. Hed always say that he would become a bada aadmi and now, he has become one, she beams.Damyanti and her group of eager volunteers and workers, go to villages like Dahanu near Mumbai to give away monthly rations, food, grains, clothes, books and stationery. The amount of selfless work she does there is another story in itself.Mark DSouza is like an angel to fellow senior citizens, whom he has been proving free meals since 2012. I do this 365 days. There is no break or holidays. In fact, I have noticed that even the rain gods support me when I step out to deliver tiffins. Nothing stops me, says the Borivali-based Samaritan.Wife Yvonne has been supporting him in his mission from the day he shared his idea with her. Yvonne is the president of the IC Colonys Women Association, which has around 400 plus ladies. We took their help when we got to know that there a few senior citizens in the colony, who were in need of meals. We started off with five-six tiffins, says Mark, whos had a difficult journey, when he lost his mother at an early age and had to stay with his relatives.Currently, the couple provides free tiffins to 56 citizens with the help of a cook, who starts the preparation from 5:30 in the morning. By 12:30 pm, piping hot home cooked meals are ready for delivery  Mark personally delivers the dabbas to nearby areas of Borivali and Dahisar, while the dabbawalas take on the delivery in places like Kandivli and Mahim.Mark ensures that the food is less oily, less salty and less spicy too. We change the menu everyday. We also cook separately for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Health conditions are kept in mind, so diabetics are given chappatis instead of rice. Yvonne and I go shopping for veggies and grocery to ensure that we get only good quality provisions, he says.The huge tiffin, delivered during lunch, ensures that the elderly dont go hungry even during dinner. Each tiffin consists of four layers, which includes rice, chappatis, vegetables and a gravy dish. So if they have rice in the afternoon, they can keep chappatis for dinner. We ensure that the quantity is such that they can also keep it for breakfast, the next day. Special dishes like biryani, desserts and fruits are served on birthdays and festivals, he informs.Mark, who is a diabetic himself, works for almost 14 hours daily and has lunch on the way when he goes to deliver tiffins. Every day is memorable with the senior citizens. And I expect nothing from them. One lady just turned 100 on August 22, last year. When she was 97, three years back, I told her we will break Sachin Tendulkars record of 100 runs. She told me, If you are my runner, then we will both make it to 100! Now, thats the best feeling ever, he recalls. Marks free dabba service has no funding from outside. I dont need any big funding. I am in the the property business as well as have an agency that provides caretakers to take care of patients. Besides, my son, daughter and son-in-law pool in money too. There are people who give small amounts. But, overall, it is God who helps me."

Each of their top leaders stayed in slums across urban pockets of Karnataka for a night.However, what caught media attention were the ""comforts"" the hosts had provided the BJP legislators.In Bengaluru, after a headline grabbing launch of his night stay in the home of an autorickshaw driver, BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa found himself in a loo controversy. The host had supposedly installed a western toilet in the home where he stayed for less than 12 hours. It is another matter that there was no water connection to the flush, rendering it redundant.No sooner did Yeddyurappa step out of Muniraju's home in Lakshmanpuri slum, did cameras catch the freshly installed western toilet in the tenement. Muniraju is an autorickshaw driver, and his wife is a maid in the nearby locality.Asked if the western toilet was a recent development in his home, Muniraju admitted it was. ""But the toilet was for my aged mother, who cannot use the Indian style toilet. It was installed a couple of days ago, but there was no water connection to the flush and we are using tap water,"" he said.He said Yeddyurappa was served rice and sambar with papad and pickle for dinner on Saturday night and two idlis and chutney, and a cup of coffee for breakfast on Sunday.""We were specifically told by the BJP that Yeddyurappa was a diabetic and cannot have much food. The papad and pickle was brought for him specially,"" said Muniraju.Yeddyurappa charged the Siddaramaiah government of neglecting several dalit communities living the slums of the state, and vowed to provide them basic amenities if voted to power.Meanwhile, in Hubballi, BJP opposition leader Jagadish Shettar spent the night in a rather ""comfortable"" slum within the city. Asked why he stayed in a slum that appeared to be ""developed"" rather than several other hutments and temporary housing slums, the former chief minister said: ""There is no developed or underdeveloped slum. A slum is a slum. We helped the people build houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, so you can find many concrete houses. However, many house owners are yet to get title deeds. The state government is delaying distribution of title deeds.""In Mysuru, BJP general secretary Shobha Karandlaje stayed at Medar Block in a communally sensitive vicinity of Kyathamaranahalli. During her address, she is said to have been heckled when she termed it a ""slum"".Nonetheless, Karandlaje spent the night at the residence of Indresh, a mason. She used the opportunity to ask the people to support BJP in the forthcoming polls and claimed that the area is rocked by communal tension as SDPI and PFI is active in the area.In Vijayapura, Mudhol MLA Govind Karjol stayed at the home of a popular shoemaker, Shankar Jamakhandi , a Dalit. Karjol was served jowar rotti and brinjal curry. Karjol and his entire entourage were served food by the family members.Raichur Rural BJP MLA Tipparaju Havaldar spent the night at a labourers' colony of Raichur Thermal Power Station in Shakti Nagar on Saturday night. Tipparaju spent the night at RTPS worker Mallikarjun's house in the colony and ate jowar roti and brinjal curry."
5b1644ba9855b744d6394f2c,States queue up at rice-rich Bengalâ€™s door for supply,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/states-queue-up-at-rice-rich-bengals-door-for-supply/articleshow/62892706.cms,2018-02-13,"Kolkata: Bengal has a queue at its doorstep. The countrys biggest producer of rice has been requested by several states  hit by a production shortage  to provide them with this staple, making this the first time ever that Bengal will provide rice at the states request.At least one of these states is BJP-ruled Jharkhand, while two other states are Left-ruled Kerala and AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu. Sources said one more BJP-ruled north Indian state is also in the queue.Bengal produces over 2.5 crore tonnes of paddy, which translates to 1.6 crore tonnes of rice. This is the countrys highest, said state finance secretary H K Dwivedi. He confirmed that that the three states had formally requested Bengal with an offer to buy its surplus rice. On an average, 23 lakh to 30 lakh tonnes of rice are procured by the government per fiscal. This fiscal, so far, 52 lakh tonnes of rice have been procured, which in itself is a great achievement, he added.TOI had reported on January 28 that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had written to Bengal about supplying rice to some states.Pradeep Mazumdar, the agriculture adviser to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, told TOI that this was the first time that the states had asked Bengal to supply rice. Dwivedi and Mazumdar were attending the State Credit Seminar 2018-19, organised by Nabard. This is a good beginning, said Mazumder. In the last two years, too, we were keen on supplying rice to other states so that we could keep prices at a level. But the Centre and FCI were not very keen on it, he added.According to Mazumdar, other states are now buying rice from Bengal and this vindicates Banerjees agricultural policy. He pointed out that the Centre and rice-deficit states mainly procure rice from Punjab, Haryana and Telangana. There was some unorganized rice export to Bangladesh and other countries after rice came under Open General Licence (OGL) in 2012. Now, there are no export restrictions, he added.Mazumdar said Bengal has requested RBI and Nabard to fix the agri credit target at Rs 70,000 crore for the next fiscal. We want Rs 1,00,000 credit per farmer. Considering 70 lakh registered farmers, it should be Rs 70,000 crore, he added. The credit projection for agriculture in 2018-19 is Rs 63,196 crore, whereas it was Rs 53,000 crore in 2017-18. However, so far, only Rs 34,000 crore could be achieved.Dwivedi also pointed out that though the macro-economic scenario in agriculture in the country as a whole was dismal, Bengal stood out. He said the states warehousing capacity had gone up from 62,000 tonnes to 6.2 lakh tonnes. More than 3.5 lakh tonnes of warehousing capacity will be added this year, he added."

Addressing the closing ceremony, Bihar governor Satya Pal Malik emphasized on the importance of khadi and why the state needs to preserve this fabric.Khadi is not just a home spun cloth but a revolutionary idea. Khadi, for Mahatma Gandhi, was symbolic of Indian self-respect and self-reliance. It enabled him to carry his message of Swadeshi and Swaraj to the people. Bihar has a large contribution in preserving and promoting khadi, said Malik.The governor also appreciated the state governments decision to formulate Bihar Khadi Policy. It will help in promoting, branding and marketing of khadi products, Malik said.The concluding ceremony of Khadi Mahotsav was attended by noted Gandhian Razi Ahmed, industry minister Jai Kumar Singh, principal secretary S Siddharth and additional secretary Pradeep Kumar, among others. It was jointly organized by department of industry and Bihar Rajya Khadi Gramodhyog Board.On the concluding day, the entrepreneurs were happy about their business. We got a very good response from the customers. Some of them even asked about our shop in Patna. We are yet to calculate the exact footfall and the sale proceeds, said Abhimanyu, a student at Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan (UMSAS), Patna, who had set up a stall of decorative items made of recycled brass and copper.Abhishek Raj, another student from UMSAS had a stall of stone-carved items. Our artisans gave live demonstration of how they carved the stones and transformed them into decorative items like statue of elephant, dodo, turtle, owl and many more. These items are popular in Rajgir and Nalanda, he said, adding it would have been better if the fair was organized in open area like Gandhi Maidan.Other artisans and weavers from across the state were also busy in selling their products on the last day. Puneet Keshri from Arwal district said: I give credit to Valentines Day that helped in surge of my sales. Many couples got their names carved on wooden keychain, rice and carved wooden nameplate. The business was much better than last year.Traders from other states were also satisfied with their business. Most women customers bought Pashmina shawl. I thought the business will not be good due to the change of place, but I was proved wrong, said Baba Mehraj, a Kashmiri weaver.Buyers at the Mahotsav were also upbeat with the wide array of products on offer. College student Rasmi Singh (21) said: I liked the khadi products here, especially the tote bags, embroider kurtis, folders and stoles. The jute handicraft was worth buying. I bought one brass lamp, which looks exactly like the one in Aladdin."

The MoU was signed by Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman and chief executive, Emirates Airline & Group, and APEDB CEO Jasti Krishna Kishore in the presence of AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who was in Dubai to drum up investments from UAE. According to a government press release, Naidu began his day in Dubai with a meeting with executives of the agrifood player Phoenix group, who informed the CM that they are focusing extensively on the Indian market. The CM was told by the Phoenix group officials that they would start a rice mill and food processing plant works as proposed earlier in the month of April. Naidu also asked the Phoenix group to explore locations for peanut farming and manufacturing of peanut butter in Anantapur.Later, in his meeting with Sheikh Al Maktoum, Naidu recalled how he was instrumental in the expansion of Emirates Airlines in India by persuading the flag-carrier of Dubai to operate an Emirates flight from Hyderabad, now the capital of Telangana. The Emirates group expressed keen interest in operating in Amaravati and other parts of AP once regulations are relaxed by the central government. The number of seats from India for flights to UAE are limited by the agreement with the Indian government and needs to be revised, Emirates officials said. Naidu invited Sheikh Ahmed to Amaravati and explore the possibility of building and operating airports and start a joint venture in aviation with the government. Naidu and the accompanying delegation from AP were taken around 25,000 sft Emirates' Network Control Centre that monitors all their stations worldwide, and air traffic in real time. The centre tracks weather conditions and their impact on flight schedules, and also comprises a Crisis Management Centre that is designed to address emergencies. He asked officials of DP World, which operates 78 marine and inland terminals in 40 countries, to set up a SEZ in AP. The group provides maritime services, logistics and ancillary services. Sharaf group chairman, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, said that Indian ports must remove bottlenecks in the supply chain and build logistics and industrial parks. Ports all over the world grew because of these facilities, he said. Naidu asked them to explore three suitable locations to establish logistics parks, and take a decision in three months.The release said Naidu was informed that executives from the Sharaf group have already visited AP to explore investment opportunities and have seen some land parcels for a food processing zone.Another bilateral meeting was held with Mohammed Ahmed Al Zarooni, director general, Dubai Airport Free Zone Authority (DAFZA), vice chairman and CEO of Dubai Silicon Oasis Authority (DSOA) and director of Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE).Naidu also met Dixon Technologies chairman Sunil Vachnani, who informed the CM they currently have an electronic goods business in Tirupati which deals in fridges, washing machines, televisions.Vachnani also told Naidu that Dixon Technologies currently has 2 lakh sft factory in Tirupati that already employs around 500 people with plans to increase it to 2000 people."
