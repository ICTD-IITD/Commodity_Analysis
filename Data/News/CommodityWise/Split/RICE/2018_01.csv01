Farmers of small holdings are left with no option when thousands of acres surrounding their fields are turned into shrimp farming tanks.We are left with no access to our fields and are ultimately forced to part with the land, Murthy Raju Vegesna, a farmer-cumactivist from Bhimavaram mandal in West Godavari district told TOI. He added that once a field is converted into a shrimp farm, the land loses its character within two years and can never be turned again into fertile agricultural land again.Also, none of the shrimp farms have the required permissions even as their area extends to several lakhs of hectares in the four districts. The traders setting up fish or shrimp ponds need to obtain permission from the fisheries department in each district in tune with the norms laid down under GO Ms No 7 issued in 2013. The old tanks too are supposed to be modified in accordance with the conditions in the new GO and fresh licences obtained.But not only are the rules being violated, those conniving with the unauthorised business are facing no action. Murthy Raju said that even West Godavari collector Bhaskar Katamneni was rendered helpless in acting against an errant assistant director of fisheries, whose negligence resulted in the emergence of many shrimp farms in the district. Though the collector filed a written complaint with the state fisheries department in May 2016 seeking disciplinary action against the assistant director, the errant officer was actually promoted as deputy director later.This shows the level of complacency and conniving of the official machinery with the traders who are bent on making money even at the cost of society. A serious food security problem is already looming large over the state and it is high time the authorities take note of it, Murthy Raju said."

This Valentines Day , we share the tales of togetherness from six such couples for whom neither the colour of their passports nor the flavour of their cuisine mattered as much as that overpowering, magical emotion called love.Over the years, many a foreign tourist has visited Vijay Kumars tattoo studio at Fort Kochi. But when Natalia from Russia walked in, on a lovely January evening last year, it was a never-before moment. She took away Vijay Kumar's heart and their love blossomed into marriage in November, last year!He describes that first meeting: Natalia visited my studio out of curiosity, not to get a tattoo done. But when we met, something magical happened. Her simplicity and soft-spoken nature struck me.For Natalia, who was working as a manager of a company in Russia, it was her first trip to India. I remember the day I met my husband, vividly. I was at the hotel near his studio for dinner. Seeing the sign board of the studio, I went in, and there he was, she says. The gentle, open minded and kind-hearted Vijay Kumar won her heart in no time. He also has a subtle sense of humour, which I liked very much, she fondly recalls.Natalia returned to Russia by January end, but the duo kept in touch. We used to call and text every day, during breaks and after her office time. I realised how she was perfect for me. I am a simple Fort Kochi man, not someone who leads an adipoli life full of alcohol and cigarettes. Natalia shares my views and understands me. When she said she was ready to marry me and settle down here, I knew it was truly special, Vijay Kumar says.Natalia came back again in July. In September, they registered their marriage and had the wedding ceremony in November. She makes great dosa, idly, tomato rice and other Indian dishes, he compliments Natalia. She adds, Its his mother who taught me to cook them. But I am yet to learn complicated dishes. A vegetarian, she names chilly gobi, chilly paneer and dal as her favourite foods.Does she miss Russia? Well, when I do, I can probably ask my husband to take me to Munnar, Natalia says. I am in touch with my family through internet and have asked them to make their next trip to Kerala. Once we save some money, Vijay and I would make our first trip to Russia together.Music composer Rahul Raj says it was love at first sight when he met Miriam Merkle from Germany for the first time. She had flown down to Kerala to study at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeethams Amritapuri campus in Kollam. It was her great love for Indian culture that made her take up this course. Rahul was a routine visitor at Amritapuri campus as part of his music assignments and he had seen her there once.She was my Orkut friend at that time and I was surprised when she sent a message  Rahul Chettaa, I have heard your compositions and they are very nice, says Rahul. Thus we became friends and fell in love later. We got married in May 2008, after five months of knowing each other. My mother was a little worried that I was marrying a western girl; she was doubtful if my non-Indian wife would be able to adopt our culture and systems. But they are now more like mother and daughter and Miriam is very fluent in Malayalam. She was very keen to understand our rituals including pujas that we perform at our houses. She is a homemaker but for me, she is a wonder woman who takes care of everything at home including my mothers health. Our daughter Akshainie Leiyas name is a blend of German and Indian cultures. For us, Valentines Day is another ordinary day. We love enjoying the ordinary days and celebrate our ordinary life which is the happiest thing for Miriam and me.Irina Antonova, 30, first connected with Paul Skaria on a social media platform in November 2010. They chatted generally on travelling, personal development and Russian history in which Paul took a lot of interest. They later lost touch and did not speak for years but the connection was reignited after Irina posted a photo from London in November 2013. Paul was working in that city then and they spent several days together and developed a strong bonding.In 2015, Paul invited her to his home in India where he introduced her to his parents and proposed to her. In July 2015, they registered their marriage in Kochi.Says Irina: I remember that day vividly because it was an unforgettable experience not only because I was the bride but also because I was getting married in another country. It was in a beautiful church not far from our home. Some traditions and customs were new but there were no major differences because we both belong to the Orthodox church. I was dressed in a white wedding gown which I brought from Moscow while Paul wore a black suit. Later, I changed to a sari and I felt like an oriental princess.The couple are now settled in Kochi. She adds: We communicate in English, so there is no language barrier between us. Of course, there are some differences but it is natural. Ive learned to respect other peoples views and opinions more and to understand the values of another culture, to think in new ways and to take new decisions. Ive started to understand myself and others better. Along with exploring a new culture I understood my own culture deeper.She remembers that on their first Valentines Day after marriage, Paul gifted her some awesome jewellery and she gave him a palette with their photos. But we have 365 days in a year when everyone gets a chance to say I love you to their beloved and family members.""Avithal Elias Lautman describes her love story as a very nerdy one. She jokes that all her life, she prayed for a chance to study in IIT but God laughed and sent her to an IIT outside India. So, it was when both she and Ronen Shmuel Lautman were students of the Israel Institute of Technology that they met at a Diwali party organised by Avithal, a jew from Kochi. He loved my channa masala and we kept bumping into each other since then. He even came for my thesis defence. He was always too shy to ask me out, even though it was obvious he liked me, she says.Before one New Year's Eve, Avithal mustered the courage to ask him out, encouraged by her best friend Sara. Luckily, he didn't have any plans. We went out for our first date on New Years Eve, and we talked the whole night. It was very romantic. I couldnt wait to see him again. We made plans to have dinner the next night, and the rest is history. They got married on October 5, 2015, and are settled in Haifa, Israel.She continues: We embraced each others cultural differences, including food and family traditions. It was easy for us as we wanted more or less the same things from life and shared ideas about money, food, lifestyle and religion. Our parents were more excited and welcoming than we thought. His family never ever made me feel uncomfortable because of who I was. And my mom was always understanding with Ronens PDA. Also we never made fun of each others culture, but we did fight over the space agencies. Also he started eating with hands and learning Malayalam. I have already taught him to say, ente bharya sundariya. And he taught me how to eat with chopsticks. We love each more because of the cultural differences.She adds: On Valentines Day, we usually avoid restaurants as it can get crowded. We do make special food that day. It is usually only the two of us and that might include walks on beaches and a really good dinner.We do tell every now and then how we appreciate each other for being there always and we do not wait for a special day to say I love you.They met first in Dhaka where Ganga Nimmy Jose Cheripuram was associated with a bank and looking for a renewable energy project for rural India through micro finance and Johannes Fischbeck was a manager in a German firm that provided energy solutions to the developing world.My first impression of Joe was not so romantic as he was very reserved. If somebody would have told me then that he would be the man I was going to marry, I would have ran away at that moment itself, says Ganga. He, however, was impressed with her socialising.The long car rides in the next three weeks changed the equations drastically. We talked about our personal lives and realised that though representing vastly different cultures, we had a lot of common views. Still, it was the shock of my life, when he, after a week, confessed me that he liked me. I turned him down but one more week later, I found myself liking him too.Soon it was time to part ways. Joe went to Tanzania for another project while Ganga returned to Kerala. Mails and skype followed, not all of it official.Three months later, they decided to get married. For Joe, it was a bit strange to marry a girl whom he knew for such a short period but getting married was the only way to be together. Luckily, it was not so difficult to convince my family, says Ganga.Six months after their first meeting, Joe came down to Kochi with his parents and best friend. The Germans were astonished to see the 500-strong crowd while the Indians thought it to be a modest wedding. Joe still complains about the 300 photographs for which he was forced to smile.Ganga joined him in Berlin and found that language was a major barrier. There were other barriers too. We are so different. Introvert to extrovert, writer to talker, reader to cook, musician to gardener, cycling to watching movies...We never share any hobbies. But then, we really compliment each other. We do all our holidays to household works together.Daughter Emma was born in India and they stayed on in Kochi. So Joe started working as a renewable energy consultant in Kochi and I started a small business that deals with landscaping and terrariums. We enjoyed every moment of our six years in Kochi with lots of fun and fellowship.She adds: When it is time for Emma to start schooling, we came back to Germany and settled here now. In Joe's words, I am living physically here and mentally in Kerala. I continue my business in Kochi and am very well updated on all happenings in Kerala."

5b1671129855b762ececfcad,Cauvery dispute Supreme Court verdict likely today: Conflict explained in 10 points,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cauvery-supreme-court-verdict-likely-today-two-states-a-river-and-a-massive-dispute/articleshow/62940629.cms,2018-02-16,"NEW DELHI: Even as Karnataka gears up for state elections and even as the Tamil Nadu government teeters due to factional infighting, all eyes are on today's expected Supreme Court SC ) verdict on the decades-old festering dispute over the waters of the Cauvery river between the two states.The verdict will be on petitions filed by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu against the final order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT).Both states are unhappy with the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal's (CWDT) February 5, 2007 verdict. After a marathon hearing on September 20, 2017, a three-judge bench of the SC reserved its verdict on the appeals filed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala against the 2007 award of the CWDT.Here is the dispute explained in 10 points:The Cauvery river originates in Karnataka's Kodagu district, flows into Tamil Nadu, reaches the Bay of Bengal at Poompuhar. Parts of three Indian states - Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka - and the Union Territory of Pondicherry lie in the Cauvery basin.The legal dispute over the waters of the Cauvery has a long history, and has its origins in agreements signed in 1892 and 1924 between the erstwhile princely state of Mysore and the Madras Presidency. The Centre constituted the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) in 1990 to resolve the dispute following a Supreme Court order. The tribunal gave Tamil Nadu 205 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet) in an interim order in 1991.In 2007, the tribunal declared its final award, in which it said Tamil Nadu should receive 419 tmcft of water, more than double of the interim order. Karnataka wasn't pleased. The award required Karnataka to release 192 tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu in ten monthly instalments every year. The Centre made the notification of the award public only in 2013, after the Supreme Court ordered it do so.Before the 2007 order, Tamil Nadu had asked for 562 tmcft - roughly three-fourths of the water available in the Cauvery basin - and Karnataka had asked for 465 tmcft - around two-thirds of the available water.The Tamil Nadu government sought the SC's intervention, saying that there was a deficit of 50.0052 tmcft of water released from Karnataka's reservoirs, with respect to the minimum limit prescribed by the CDWT. Tamil Nadu claimed the tribunal's award was erroneous as the allocation of water was based on cultivation of just one crop. It contended that two crops are cultivated in the state. The state said its farmers needed more water to begin cultivating samba - a kind of rice grown in the state. The Karnataka government responded by saying it wouldn't be able to release any more Cauvery water, as low rainfall during the monsoon had left its reservoirs half-empty.On September 5, the SC ordered Karnataka to release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu every day for 10 days. A day later, Karnataka's Mandya, Mysuru and Hassan districts witnessed intense and often violent protests. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said his government would have to release the water, but with ""a heavy heart"". He added the state would file a petition in the SC seeking modification of the order.On September 20, the SC reserved its verdict on the appeals filed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala against the 2007 award of the CWDT, after a marathon hearingOn January 9 this year, the SC indicated it would deliver within a month its verdict on the decades-old Cauvery water dispute, saying enough confusion has been created on it for over two decades. The top court also said that no forum could touch the matter relating to the Cauvery basin, until it gave its verdict.Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami's appeal to immediately release 7 tmcft of Cauvery water was turned down by Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah.""After reserving the minimum needs of drinking water supply and perennial crops, Karnataka can release at least 15 tmcft of water that is crucial for the standing crops in the Cauvery delta,"" said Palaniswami in a letter to Karnataka, explaining why the state needed water.Karnataka said, ""no"".""How can we release water when storage levels in our reservoirs in the Cauvery river basin are low? There is no question of releasing water now,"" chief minister Siddaramaiah told reporters in New Delhi. He also referred to the impending SC verdict on the Cauvery water sharing row and stated that the state government will prefer to wait for the verdict.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra delivers the unanimous verdict this morning. At a cabinet meeting yesterday, Karmataka ministers told the CM they were hoping to get an additional 40tmcft. The verdict will be on petitions filed by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu against the final order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal. Karnataka was the first to challenge this award in the SC and was quickly followed by Kerala and Tamil Nadu.Anticipating trouble following the SC's final verdict, elaborate police arrangements have been made in Bengaluru. Police commissioner T Suneel Kumar told TOI that 70 platoons of the Karnataka State Reserve Police and 30 platoons of City Armed Reserve will be deployed across the city.In Mandya, security is being beefed up. AS many as 25 state police platoons, 20 district armed reserve police platoons, and 50 striking forces are deployed across the district. As many as 1,300 police personnel led by eight deputy superintendents of police, 25 circle police inspectors and 60 police sub-inspectors will be drafted for security.(With inputs from Agencies)"

The use of unconventional, local and indigenous ingredients to brew a first-of-a-kind beer got us working. We have made a ragi pineapple ale and bajra ale. Both received a positive response, Bhosale added.Hazra said beer from malted jowar is popular in other countries.  Millets are losing out to grain like wheat, rice and corn. Brewing beer from millets can increase consumption, she said.It would boost demand for millets prompting farmers to undertake large-scale cultivation, she added.  It will break the monoculture in agriculture which has led to water scarcity and loss of soil nutrients. The demand will improve soil health and give local farmers an optional crop for cultivation, Hazra said.The microbrewery will source millets from local farmers. We are looking at a tie-up with an NGO called Happy Roots which works with farmers in the state. They will provide us with millets but help with the malting process. If the malted grain they provide works for our brews, we will start placing larger orders. If it does not work, we will procure grain from them and turn it over to malting plants in North India, Bhosale said.Millet beers, Bhosale added, taste like any wheat or barley beer. Restaurants are keen on introducing these beers on their menus. We are sure it will get a good response, he said."

They alleged various irregularities in procurement of paddy at DPCs, and asked the district administration to wean out the malpractices in them. The demands were raised during the farmers grievance redressal meeting held at the collectors office on Friday.Earlier, the farmers felicitated collector, K Veera Raghava Rao for his efforts to release water from the reservoirs. Farmers had picketed the busy Tallakulam junction on February 12, demanding water to save their withering paddy crop, alleging that the mismanagement of authorities especially public works department (PWD) has driven them to misery.Addressing the farmers, collector said that after prolonged efforts and talks with PWD and local bodies, which are worried about drinking water in their areas, it has been decided to release 900 cusecs of water for a period of three days. He asked them to utilise the water judiciously and save as much as crop they could with provided water.As the meeting proceeded, farmers brought up the topic of DPCs stating that most of them benefit only rice merchants and outsiders.A N M Thiruppathi, a farmer said that officials from the civil supplies department are demanding Rs 10,000 to put up a DPC . Besides, a farmer has to shell out Rs 50 per sack of 51kg of paddy, as weighing and loading charges while bringing their paddy to DPCs, he complained. Farmer Alagu Servai from Panaiyur said the district administration has to take a call while setting up a DPC and it is important that officials should study the requirement and open where necessary. In this manner, any malpractices could be prevented, he added."
5b1679b29855b75db2e77143,Being different made all the difference,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/being-different-made-all-the-difference/articleshow/62923521.cms,2018-02-15,"Trichy: The rain is not adequate. Sudden heat waves create challenging conditions for crops. Besides, poor harvest drive farmers into a debt trap. Considering these factors, many people see farming as a not very attractive occupation. Dispelling such myths, a woman farmer from a hamlet near Lalgudi has emerged successful by adopting techniques advocated by agriculture department authorities.With more migration of men to urban areas, women are becoming cultivators, entrepreneurs and farm labourers. The Economic Survey 2018 calls it the feminisation of agriculture. The government is now earmarking at least 30% of the budget allocation for women in all schemes, including agriculture, to mainstream them. Saraswathi , 48, of Thirumangalam near Lalgudi, has been cultivating a 4.5-acre land for the past 25 years as her husband Veeramani was busy with their milk business.Until I took over farming from my husbands family members, cultivation was going on just because they had to do something. I adopted scientific farming practices and the yield began to multiply, Saraswathi said,Her passion for farming has won her many laurels, including an award from the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Sirugamani in Trichy district for executing the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method for cultivating Co RH -3 variety rice. Using this, she was able to harvest 50 bags of paddy in an acre.Saraswathi says that apart from adapting such techniques, farmers should give more importance to water management.Farmers who irrigate their land using filter point bore wells could get more yield that those who draw water from irrigation channels, he said.A wet and dry system should be adapted to get good result. Following the age-old method will not give us good yield. Besides, input costs are shooting up by the day. If farmers want to earn much more than what they spend, they should follow the instructions of agriculture scientists and adopt progressive techniques, she stressed.Since I have cows, bulls and a lot of trees, I need not use much fertilizers. I dont use pesticides either. I use biofertilizers after analysing the type of soil and its requirement, he added.Earlier, agriculture officers regularly visited agriculture fields and met farmers to find out whether the methods they advocated are being employed. Those days are gone as they have a staff crunch. These days we ourselves approach the department for advice, she said."

So, when should a person react and how?Malayalis woke up to their social media feeds flooded with the images of the Adivasi youth Madhu on Friday, tied up and helpless, as one of his attackers took a selfie with him, probably to show the world how heroic they were.

But all that the 27-year-old had in his bag were packets of chilli and coriander powder, a little rice and a phone charger. The video which circulated on social media showed the mob questioning a dazed looking Madhu, as he stood amidst a crowd who jeered and taunted him.Social media fumed and poured out their outrage over the incident, with the general sentiment being that they were ashamed of being called a Malayali. But then, Kerala has been witnessing similar instances of late  when a mentally ill woman was scalded and beaten up by a group of her neighbours, when transgender Chandana was attacked at Valiyathura, when a migrant labourer was beaten up by the mob for alleged child kidnapping in North Kerala being some among them.Since when did Malayalis start taking law into their hands? Is it because they arent aware of the nitty-gritties of the law? Is it because they have lost confidence in the system? Or is it something else? We try to find out...It has nothing to do with losing confidence in the system, according to human rights activist advocate Maya Krishnan. In Madhus incident, they assumed that an Adivasi living inside the forest cannot possibly have packaged foods and a charger in his bag unless he stole them. Transgender Chandana was attacked because the local people couldnt accept a gender beyond man and woman. Also a dark woman was branded a kidnapper when a fair-skinned child was found with her. None of these people were doing it to protect society or because they do not trust the State or the system. They just become aggressive when they come across something which is different from their moral views. They strongly believe that what is right and wrong for them should be so for all, she says, adding that it is high time Malayalis admitted to their prejudices of privilege. Even the police have notions like: All those in shabby clothes are mentally ill, all long-haired men are druggies etc. We should start accepting that we are not a progressive and secular State, she adds.Agreeing with her is psychiatrist CJ John according to whom all of us have a feudal mindset. We see that in social media as well, where people brand some sections or communities as evil  transgenders, tribals, the mentally ill, migrant labourers etc. The feudalistic attitude is taken out on them. It is in no way a proclamation of our strength but a proclamation of our immaturity and innate cruelty, he says.All human beings have an aggressive side which is kept in check by our moral values and a fear of punishment, adds Dr John. When a crowd is involved, one person can trigger the aggression. The entire crowd joins to manhandle the one whom they adjudge a criminal. The crowd turns out to be wrong most of the time. There is an increased climate for aggression in Kerala now  be it political murder, domestic violence, or street fights, he says.And by no means can we brush it off as mob mentality, they say. The government should strongly intervene and make people realise that it is against the law, asserts Maya.Dr John too says that a very clear message has to be given to society that no one has the right to take law into their hands. The only duty of the general public is to detain an alleged criminal. They have to inform the police and hand him/her over to them. They should be informed that anything beyond that is a crime. And such crimes should be booked. Only then will there be a change in the mentality. Or else, they will consider this as an act of heroism, he says.According to him, had Madhu not been killed, the incident would have been dismissed as one where a crowd attacked an alleged thief and set the social order right. Let society realise that it is not heroism but crime and a lack of humanity, he says.Throwing light on the legal side of mob violence, academician and researcher Veena Roshan Jose from Kochi says the principle followed in every modern legal system, including India, is that any person charged with a criminal offence will be termed innocent until proven guilty. This presumption of innocence is the cardinal principle of criminal law. And the proof which is required for punishing a person is proof beyond doubts. Thus a person is just an accused until he is convicted after a fair trial, she explains.Indian law details about the procedure that should be followed in every criminal investigation and trial in the code of criminal procedure. Section 43 of The Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr. P. C) provides for the circumstances in which a private individual can make an arrest and the procedure to be followed on such arrest. ""The section permits a private person to make an arrest when a person commits a non-bailable and cognisable offence, or any proclaimed offence in his presence, in the absence of a police officer. He can take such person or cause him to be taken into custody at the nearest police station. Even police officers require a warrant from the magistrate to arrest a person, and can do so without one only if it is a bailable or non-cognisable offence, she says.When it comes to a question of civic sense, Veena says the basis of legal education should start from the family itself. The basis of all legal systems is the concept of natural law. Principles like One shall not harm others, and one shall not steal should be ingrained in one even without a formal teaching of the laws. What is required is a self-imposition. You can learn that only from the family, schools and society, she says.Dr John too says that awareness of such basic rules should be given during childhood itself. It is impossible to teach empathy to adults. You can teach someone to respect others irrespective of colour, caste or creed, only in childhood, he sums up.: If anyone finds anything wrong happening around, they should know that there is a law and order system here. The public have only the right to inform and provide necessary help to the police to ensure that the law is being implemented. Harming or hurting the accused person is never right. The reaction of one person to a situation will be different from that of the other. So whether it is a positive action or not, according to them, no one has the right to take law into his/her hands. If someone has done anything illegal, leave him/her to the law. Not even the police have the right to hurt an alleged criminal.The officer, however, points out that there is no such restriction when it comes to a natural calamity or accident, when people should react quickly. Then they neednt wait for the police to reach the spot. If someone is drowning, one should not wait saying it is the duty of the police. So, we should handle situations objectively. They should have the discernment to know how to react and when. Let the law take its course. If the youth had showed the same temper during a rescue operation, it would have been a positive thing."

February 23 also marked the 399th anniversary of an apparition of Jesus on a wooden cross planted at the site.The solemn feast mass was celebrated by fifteen priests in a specially-erected pandal outside the shrine. The main celebrant was Fr Alfred Vaz , parish priest of Se Cathedral. There were two earlier masses at 6.30am and 8am, and rice gruel (pez) was served to devotees after every mass. The Fr Mario DCosta-led Se Cathedral choir led the singing at all three masses, and rice gruel (pez) was distributed to devotees thereafter.The belief in the miraculous cross dates back to the early 17th century. It is believed that some shepherd boys from the locality erected a three-and-a-half-foot tall cross where the shrine stands today. At midnight on February 23, 1619, it grew to six feet, and rays of bright light were seen emanating from the sky and falling on the cross, on which was the crucified Christ.Thus began the devotion to the miraculous cross."

However, there is not much change in other parts of the state. This shows that the sales have dropped here after fake transactions were stopped, an RTI activist Ajay Jangid said.He approached the city police commissionerate and district collectorate in 2017, informing them about the racket. An inquiry was initiated, but concrete action started only when purchases by top politicians and businessmen were exposed on social media.Over Rs 90 lakh of public money spent on subsidy of food grains and kerosene has been saved in just one month due to drop in the sales. The sales have dropped since fake transactions have stopped. Further strict actions are required to be taken to save public money, he added.The accused were using stolen biometric data to carry out transactions under NFSA. It was sold to the racketeers by an agency hired by government to collect data. So far police have arrested 13 accused in eight complaints about NFSA racket."

Whats encouraging, say experts, is its possible provided Karnataka releases the 177.25tmcft water as fixed by the apex court. With better water management practices and cropping methods, farmers can manage a good yield, Tamil Nadu farmers should opt for less water-intensive crops and drought-resistant paddy varieties. At the same time, the government should take steps to tap existing water resources in a judicious manner, say experts.Now we have to readjust our irrigation and cropping methods. TN receives 950mm to 1000mm rainfall, the second largest state to receive this much rainfall during northeast monsoon. About 30% of this drains into sea. We can conserve this water and ensure one crop in all districts, says Tamil Nadu Agricultural University vice-chancellor K Ramasamy.He suggests that there are irrigation techniques to conserve water. For instance, through alternate wetting and drying method (AWD), 30% of water can be conserved without any yield reduction. A plastic or bamboo pipe of 40cm length and 15cm diameter with drilled holes is sunk into the rice field partially. When the water level inside the pipe falls, it is refilled. This way, farmers can save 5,000 litres of water for each kg of rice produced. TNAU scientists say this method is widely followed in the Philippines and Vietnam.V Saraswathi, 48, of Thirumangalam near Lalgudi in Trichy district, a progressive farmer cultivating on a 4.5-acre land for the past 25 years, follows wet and dry method. This method gives a good yield and reduces input costs by way of reduced electricity consumption for pumping water, she says.Progressive farmers also suggest borewells instead of drawing directly from irrigation channels for lesser water utilisation.To mitigate water scarcity, drought-resistant varieties can be cultivated. There are less water-intensive, location-specific varieties like Anna (R) 4 for Thanjavur, Co 51, MDU 5 - a short duration fine grain variety - and modified CR 1009, which are both drought and flood tolerant, says Ramasamy. For Nagapattinam, where sea water incursion has wreaked havoc with agriculture, scientists have developed paddy varieties that grow in saline water. Agricultural experts say the cropping pattern can be reworked. Right now, we go for 100 to 180 days duration paddy crops, which require 14 to 20 wettings. But millets need six wettings only, said an agricultural scientist. But there is resistance from farmers as well as government authorities when we suggest alternative crops as Cauvery has now become a politically-surcharged issue, he said.Some radical changes should be brought about in the cropping pattern like going for just samba cultivation in the OctoberJanuary season. During kuruvai season, farmers can opt for cereals and pulses. Water is no longer released from Mettur reservoir for kuruvai as per the customary schedule on June 12. Instead of waiting for Mettur water release, farmers can go for millets which require less water, the scientist said.On the part of the government, there should be an additional thrust on conserving water bodies.

The pongala frenzy is reaching its crescendo as the women here are busy purchasing the items including pots and saris for the ceremony. With the religious fete set to be held on March 2, the shops are wooing the women and girls with easy-to-make pongala kits . These pongala packages as they are called, have every component and ingredient used for offering pongala and the best part is that the shopkeepers are even offering choottu and kothumbu from Pollachi and a hearth for free along with the purchase!Baburaj T, accounts officer of New Maharajas Dress World, a textile shop at Pulimoodu that sells the pongala package for `799, tells us, The kit includes 23 items including the payasam ingredients such as 1 kg chambav rice and jaggery, cashewnuts, ghee, raisins, cardamom, a steel ladle, a cotton towel, a pot and a sari. It will also have lamp oil, camphor, beaten rice, sandalwood and a matchbox  packed in a shopping bag. The sales began from February 10 and the response has been great.Interestingly, for those who prefer to stick to the traditional way of offering pongala to Attukal amma in the mud pot, the shop has plenty to offer. We have made it customer friendly as one can select the type of pot and hearth they want to use for the pongala. For those who wish to cook in the traditional method, we have earthen pots and bricks as hearth while others can use steel containers and stove.Some of the devotees also laud the easy availability of the components. Homemaker Suchitra, from Mannanthala, who was busy selecting her sari for the pongala day, says, It makes it easy for us as most of us will be there only to offer the pongala. In the past few years, it was difficult for me to arrange the choottu and kothumbu from friends and relatives. This year, I got these for free so I dont have to worry about that aspect.Techie Remya Parameshwaran, who will be performing her first pongala this year, says, My husband and I are from Chennai and we are settled here. As its my first time offering pongala, neither of us are aware of the items required. I saw a hoarding about this offer and thats how I got here. I believe such offers must also be made available through online shopping.Meanwhile, another customer Sashikala, employed at Social Welfare Department of Kerala says that the pongala kits are quite helpful for employed women. We will be working till the previous evening of the pongala, so it is hard to purchase each item from different shops. But offers like these are beneficial for us as we dont have to roam around the markets and shops buying individual items.I think it will be more preferred by the young women as they get everything in one package, says Sashikala, who was one of the customers at Ramachandran Textiles, a popular textile shop at Attakulangara.While the shop doesnt provide the entire kit, it did offer some attractive deals such as the purchase of a cotton sari worth Rs 369 or set mundu will fetch you a steel pot, plate and ladle for free. Its manager Prabha Harrison says, We have special pongala offers for the customers every year. Even for grocery items, we provide combo offers and discounts for items used in making pongala payasam.Although the festival offers were welcomed by most city folks, there were also women who did not jump at the offers. Its good that these offers make pongala preparations easy. But according to me offering pongala to Attukal amma is sacred and we should not chose an easy way to do it. Procuring each item for the pongala by taking the effort is also part of our devotion, says Uma Rajasenan, a bank employee.With hardly a week to go for the Attukal pongala, the city is swelling with earthen pot sellers. A beeline of pots can be found from Ayurveda college junction to the premises of Attukal Bhagavathy Temple at Manacaud. Murugan from Poovar, who has been selling pots at Attakulangara for a decade now, says the prices are flexible and most customers dont bargain as it is for Attukal pongala. It is an offering to the goddess and if they offer the pongala in our earthen pots, we will also feel blessed. The prices for the pots range from Rs 70, Rs 50 and Rs 10 depending on the sizes."

I stay in Chennai for my work, which is also a clean place. But I must say that Vizag is cleaner, especially its beaches and roads. Such compliments for the port city are not one-off  visitors from other states and countries have more or less said the same things about Vizag many times before  but when such praise comes from a Japanese delegate, it assumes significance. After all, Japan is known to be one of the cleanest countries in the world.Not just the city, the local cuisine too has become a favourite of Noritada Hayashi. Its much like what we eat in Japan. Here too, people eat rice and fish. I have not faced any problems with the food here though its a bit spicy, he says. Hayashi is from Tokyo, and currently works in Chennai as director of Jetro, an external trade organisation of the Japan government.The cleanliness of the city has also not escaped the eyes of George ONeal from California. During my drive to the hotel from the airport, I found Vizag to be a clean and green city. Theres no much natural beauty around, there are hills, forests and seas. Driving on the roads back home in California is a nice experience, and its a similar feel when you drive on Vizag roads. Moreover, I am really loving Indian and Andhra food, says George, co-founder of Karman Inc, who is on his first visit to the City of Destiny.Another delegate, Steel Lee from South Korea, who is the director of Daeha Co, was also struck by the citys cleanliness. Its a good place for business. After the conference, we hope to do some sightseeing around the city and will go to the beaches. We are also interested in setting up our manufacturing unit in Andhra Pradesh, said Lee.The Spanish delegation went for a walk on the beaches soon after their arrival and found them very nice.Thanks to the local administration for rigorously following Swachhta, for hundreds of foreign delegates present at the three-day CII Partnership Summit , its been a pleasant experience being in a clean and green Indian city."

Then they had to withdraw the amount to buy rice at Rs 32 per kg.The RTF study, which surveyed 244 beneficiary families in 13 randomly selected villages in Nagri, has found that many of them have not been able to avail the subsidised grain because of tedious process and the costs involved in withdrawing the amount deposited in their bank accounts.The study found that on an average each family has 3.4 bank accounts and 95% of them have not been informed about the account linked to the food subsidy scheme. As a result, people have had to shuttle between various banks, covering an average distance of 4.3km.Further, for the last four months, the families have got ration only for two months and had to spend 15 hours completing formalities to collect it. Over 97% of the respondents said they want the government to abandon the scheme and revert to the earlier system of food distribution.Among those facing the project's brunt is Daniel Tirkey of Singhpur village, who has got a notice saying his ration card will be cancelled if he does not procure the ration allotted to him. Then there is Jamuna Tirkey, who has been asked to collect his quota of ration within a couple of days, failing which his allotment would lapse. Fulti Kachchap, 85, spends Rs 300 on travelling to the bank to get a subsidy of Rs 32 per kg of rice. Fulo Mundain of Kenke village has two bank accounts and for 15 days she did the rounds of both branches to figure out which one is linked the scheme. She hasn't received any money in the last two months.There are also cases where people have not been able to procure ration even though the money has been transferred to their account. Basi Orain's husband works in Punjab and the food subsidy is credited to his account. Despite her concerted effort, her account has not been linked for the subsidy and she is unable to access the money. Jean Dreze, noted developmental economist and architect of the survey, said, ""This is yet another case where the poor are being used as guinea pigs for experimenting with unreliable technologies. For many beneficiaries, the so-called food subsidy has become a burden. Yet they are cooperating with the DBT system as they fear that their ration card could be cancelled.""The state government has said it plans to extend the scheme to other blocks and districts, depending on the pilot project's success. Dr Amitabh Kaushal, state food and public distribution secretary, said, ""We are going to conduct a concurrent evaluation. We will convene the meeting under the chairmanship of the state minister for food and public distribution services Saryu Rai on Feb 27."""

The beautiful East Khasi Hills landscape-housing two assembly constituencies-has been left scarred and barren with deep craters to boot.Years of rampant mining of coal has robbed Sutgna and several other areas in the Jaintia Hills bordering Bangladesh, of its greenery and livelihood. Ever since coal mining-in fact the most unscientific rat-hole mining for black gold-took off in the 1970s in the then undivided Jaintia Hills, the economy of the place in particular, and that of Meghalaya as a whole, has been intrinsically linked to the extraction of this mineral. Locals prospered even at the cost of the environment and loss of lives.The scenario changed when the National Green Tribunal banned rat-hole and other forms of illegal coal mining in the state. While the ecology got a breather, the impact of the ban shook the economy, affected the livelihoods of many and the rumblings were reflected in politics.As Meghalaya readies for the February 27 assembly polls, the issue of the ban on coal mining has taken centre stage again. The ban no doubt left thousands jobless who now vent their anger on political parties-Congress in particular-during whose rule the ban came into force. Their grouse is that no alternative livelihood options were worked out by the government when the ban was imposed.Congress working president and MP Vincent Pala said, ""People think the government banned mining, but it is not true. The government followed the court's order. We have explained to the people and now they are supporting us.""However, it was a great challenge for Congress to go to the people with their side of the story. For one, its support base had eroded in the coal-mining areas of the Jaintia and Garo Hills. The two regions alone account for 31 of the 60 seats in the assembly-seven in the Jaintia Hills and 24 in the Garo Hills.Congress insiders said Rahul Gandhi 's first visit to the northeast after taking over as the AICC president last month, was to boost the morale of the party workers in the Jaintia Hills. On January 30, Rahul went to Jowai, 60 km from here and the headquarters of the West Jaintia Hills district, where he interacted with over 1,000 Congress leaders and workers.Sensing the anger of the people and the fact that the ruling party is on a sticky wicket here, BJP and the National People's Party have tried to fill in the void and made this an electoral issue promising voters they would see if scientific ways could be evolved to keep the livelihoods of the people intact. BJP has promised to resume coal mining within 180 days of coming to power, while ensuring that there are no harmful environmental fallouts.NPP, an ally of the NDA at the Centre, which has emerged as the main challenger to Congress, said the party is seriously raising the issue of mining with the people. Erwin K Syiem Sutgna, who once spearheaded the movement for providing livelihoods to the people, is now an NPP candidate for the North Shillong ST reserved assembly seat. He said migration of the rural population to urban areas increased 'manifold' after the ban. ""We have to find a solution to the problem. NPP is serious and actively pursuing the issue. Thousands are jobless now,"" Sutgna said.""Mining was banned because it was being done in an unscientific way. If we do it scientifically, it could boost the state's economy and help solve the state's unemployment problem,"" BJP spokesperson Basu Chakraborty said."

VenkatachalapathyC_VENKATACHALAPATHYWhen numismatist C. Tamilvanan displayed a silver coin minted during the Vijayanagara empire, its size baffled onlookers. The size of a rice grain, the coin that weighs 0.19 grams and dates back to the 13th century is proof that nanotechnology had its early beginnings in India, he says.Twelve such small-sized coins of different weights of the Vijayanagara period are among his prized possession. He displayed eight of them at a three-day exhibition of the most expensive and rarest coins, stamps and currencies of India and the world that was inaugurated at Town Hall on Friday.On this tiny coin of denomination tara, the Telugu script for Bu denoting emperor Bukka Raya has been inscribed. This is what we call nano coins. Only recently did numismatists start to take notice of these small coins. We have started to document these coins and are studying the purpose for which they could have been used, he said.Another silver coin of Vijayanagara empire, weighing 0.21 grams, has also been displayed. Mr. Tamilvanan, who is the secretary of Numismatic and Philatelic Association of Vellore Fort, has also put on display his collection of coins minted by the Arcot Nawabs. I have displayed 160 coins minted by the Arcot Nawabs in all the areas occupied by them starting from Arcot to Kanniyakumari, he said.Another collection on display at the exhibition belongs to R.S.

At 33 locations in the town, the homeless are fed by volunteers of Food Bank Telangana, an initiative by an amateur social worker Naveen Chanti.With an aim to fight hunger, the Food Bank has been feeding the homeless since the past two years. Started at one location in the initial stages, it has now gone from strength to strength spreading its philanthropic activity to Kamareddy, Nirmal, Armoor, Sattupally, Nalgonda, Hyderabad, Karimnagar, Sidhipet and Warangal.The Food Bank volunteers prepare two vegetarian curries and rice at their respective houses and gather at their headquarters at Madhavanagar. From there, they leave for their allotted locations to distribute food wrapped in silver foil. In the process, they also make sure that the food is healthy and nutritious.The idea of distributing free food took shape when Mr. Chanti felt disturbed at the fate of street-dwellers who are always at the mercy of alm-givers. To make a small difference in their lives, he and his wife Vijayamala decided to feed them at least a square meal a day. Initially, they used to prepare food only for 30 persons. As their work started getting noticed by others, they voluntarily joined the couple in their fight against hunger. Today, the Food Bank, Nizamabad, has 275 volunteers.Each volunteer gets his or her turn to cook and feed the homeless at least once in two months. They prepare food at their houses and by 7.30 p.m., they are ready with food packets and drinking water to be distributed at their allotted location.As of now, there are 33 locations that we have identified where homeless are concentrated. We do not take money or gifts from any person or organisation. Anyone can volunteer and provide food to the street-dwellers, said Mr. Chanti. Bussa Anjaneyulu, Indian Red Cross Society district secretary, said, The Food Bank volunteers provide food to about 150 persons every day, while on Sunday the number may cross 450. Non-vegetarian is strictly avoided, but one boiled egg is given to all on Sundays. The concept has been well-received by the people and appreciation has been pouring in from all quarters."

Its focus is on dryland farming in the wake of the State accounting for the largest amount of drought-prone land in the country next to Rajasthan.The budget has proposed a direct benefit transfer scheme for dryland farmers through the Raitha Belaku scheme that seeks to provide Rs. 5,000 a hectare to farmers who cultivate rainfed crops. The amount is subject to a maximum of Rs. 10,000 per farmer. About 70 lakh farmers are expected to benefit from this scheme, which will cost the exchequer an additional Rs. 3,500 crore a year.The budget has also earmarked Rs. 600 crore for continuing the governments flagship programme of Krishi Bhagya that will help dryland farmers.Organic farmingThe government has proposed to increase the extent of organic farming cultivation in the State from the present 1 lakh hectares to 1.5 lakh hectares in the next three years, under a cluster model. Similarly, Rs. 24 crore has been allocated for increasing the area of cultivation of minor millets from 42,000 hectares to 60,000 hectares.The budget also proposes to popularise the direct seeded rice method that conserves water by 35% when compared to the traditional transplantation system.While a research centre in the name of the late farmers leader M.D. Nanjundawamy is being set up on the Gandhi Krishi Vijnana Kendra campus of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, an agricultural research centre has been proposed at Muddebihal of Vijayapura district. A new agricultural college has been proposed for Chamarajanagar district.In the horticulture sector, the budget has proposed promoting cultivation of exotic fruits. Also, an allocation of Rs. 10 crore has been proposed for integrated pest and nutrient management of horticultural crops on about 1 lakh hectares of land.Apart from promoting hydroponics technology for certain vegetable crops in urban and peri-urban areas, the budget also includes a scheme for rejuvenation of coconut plantations over five years.Experts feel the budget should have proposed some concrete measures to make farming a sustainable activity through better access to marketing and upgrading of infrastructure, especially in the post-harvesting and processing stages."

For India, Korea has emerged as a new market after the United States, European Union and Japan.Admitting that value addition was still lacking, he said Visakhapatnam, despite being a leading fish landing centre, lacked awareness among the fish farmers on stopping juvenile fishing and ensuring sustainable fishing.Quality complianceHe said food processing facilities would come up for tapping the potential for value addition and improving exports of tuna from the East Coast.Underlining the importance of adhering to quality compliance, he said the importers were laying down stringent conditions due to heavy competition in seafood exports.The thrust was on increasing value of addition with minimal processing.He said the United States had remained the largest market for Indian exporters with South East Asia poised to take over No. 2 slot from the European Union.Black tiger captured in West Bengal and Odisha was getting a very good response in the export market.Besides seafood, basmati rice and bovine meat had huge potential for exports, he added."

Journalists and photographers had a shock as there was no official information about Mr. Gandhis visit. However, it turned out to be a businessman whose name also begins with Rahul. Hundreds of devotees gathered at the feet of the statue and stretched their arms allowing the water poured on the statue to fall on them.The hues of the statue changed as milk, turmeric paste, sandalwood paste, rice flour and ashtagandha were poured. The ceremony ended with offering of floral tributes to Bahubali, who renounced his kingdom in pursuit of spirituality.Vain bidAt the end of the ceremony, Jain monks made a vain bid to garland the statue.Their repeated attempts failed. Chain pulleys installed on the scaffolding to place the garland did not help. While one end of the garland was fitted, the other end fell.The event came to an end by 2.30 p.m. By then hundreds of people had gathered at the gates to enter the hills.Nagaraj, a resident of Halekote in Holenarasipur, said he had been waiting from 9 a.m. to climb the hills.

In Zaheerabad, where farmers produce multi-crop harvests, a ritual called Gattu Koorchavadam is followed to test the germination and quality of multiple seeds.The ritual, which is also known as Dasara Gatlu , is observed by women. During the Dasara festival time, when the soil is ready for new crops, the women mix nine important seeds  Sayi Jonna, Lankelu, Chiru Senagalu, Kusumalu, Godhuamlu, Aviselu, Battagadi, Pelala Jonnalu and Erra Jonnalu  into a single pot with untested soil.The soil and seed spread is placed on a leaf and two fresh pots decorated with a piece of jowar and sugarcane, garlanded with flowers and betel leaves. Another pot, filled with oil, has an earthen lamp that glows round the clock for the 12-day period of the ritual. Five dried coconut cups filled with rice are kept around the pots. The seeds for the ritual are brought from the house of the village elder, who is called Patel. The Patel is also the seed keeper of the village. However, seeds are also purchased from other sources. The ritual is observed for five to 12 days, depending on the interest of the farmer and how long it takes for the seeds to sprout.When the seeds sprout, the women visit each others house to determine the quality of seeds and their germination. The sprouts are compared and the best seed is identified. If the sprouts of a crop are weak, they make sure to replace it with another seed. If the sprouts are good, then they would proceed to cultivate them in the field.The ritual also accounts for the fact that Zaheerabad is a water scarce area. Therefore, all these crops are not water-intensive. They are cultivated under the rainfed agriculture practice, for which the sole source of irrigation is the rainfall that the field receives.The Deccan Development Society, as part of a mobile biodiversity festival session, organised the Gattu Korchavadam programme. Begari Lakshmamma, a woman who offered prayers by lighting a lamp at the programme, said, Water is scarce commodity here. Any crop that grows without water will be worshipped by offering puja."

The Agriculture department had supported this initiative.Nineteen farmers in the village in October last year came together to raise paddy on 32 acres of land using organic manure, and five months down the line and after realising decent profit, they are upbeat about continuing the same next season.

I have made a profit of Rs. 22,000 per acre, he added.It was early last year that the group of youth Vasanth, Varun (both from Chennai), Parvatha, Nandhini (from Puducherry), Ganesamoorthy (Pattukottai) and Priyan (Dindugal) fresh after the Neduvasal agitation got together and decided to take up worthwhile innovative project to change the concept of farming.Mr. Ganesamoorthy, who gave up his engineering career to promote organic farming, said the Union Territory was chosen for the pilot project because of its easy accessibility.A big supportThe group approached the Agriculture department and offered to help farmers raise organic paddy.We promised to supply traditional variety of paddy seed for sowing, manure and promised to procure the harvested paddy. It took considerable time to convince the farmers, he said.After the farmers showed interest, the paddy fields were divided into different zones so that water from nearby fields where pesticides are used for cultivation did not enter the area where organic paddy was raised, he said.Ms. Nandhini said after the sowing, the next task was to get a good market for the products.We sought suggestions with our group of friends in social media. Around 1,000 people showed keen interest in purchasing the rice if it was pesticide free. This encouraged us. Following the social media response, we promised to procure the paddy for Rs. 3,000 a quintal, she said.The rice was sold in gunny bags with the tag Seliamedu Rice locally and in Tamil Nadu, she added.From 32 acres, the group of youth, with the support of Agriculture department, plans to extend the project to Karaikal and other villages in Puducherry.K. Peramanadane, Agricultural Officer, Selimamedu Uzhavar Udhaviyagam, said last month paddy raised on six acres of land was harvested. From one acre, the farmer could get 1,575-1,650 kg of paddy, he added."

Had we tried ordering food from Taamonline, he wanted to know. Nice, genuine biryani, he said. And I swung into action.The moment I hear the word biryani I get activated, quite like Pavlov and dog. For someone who is essentially a wheat eater, I cant quite understand this great love I have for biryanis. But as I have said before, I truly enjoy this rice-and-meat dish  irrespective of where it is from. I love the spiciness of the Hyderabadi biryani, the richness of the Awadhi one, the more rustic taste of the Delhi version, the juicy potato in the Calcutta dish and the variations that you find in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. I dont even mind the pickled taste of the Moradabadi biryani.So, of course, I went online to get to know more about Taam.It turned out that it is a service which provides biryanis, kormas, kababs and other such delicious dishes in kilos.Diversity on tableBut a sampler came home, and I tried out quite a few of the dishes  and had a great meal, indeed.There was quite a spread  biryani, korma, kababs, baghare baigan, meethi roti and sewain. I think I enjoyed the lamb shami kababs the most  they were soft, the meat was deliciously tender and lightly spiced, and what I really liked was that they were not thick and chunky, as kababs often are, but thin, like home-cooked kababs. The kababs had been made with beaten meat and not minced meat, so they were exceptionally tasty. I ate a piece with a small chunk of the meethi roti, and found they complemented each other rather well.The Lucknowi biryani was good, too. The rice was long-grained, and the meat pieces were well cooked. It was rightly spiced  neither too much, nor too little.Nawabi dishThe mildly sweet taste of the Hyderabadi dish, baghare baigan, was delightful. The tamarind in it gave it the tart edge that it needed. But, somehow, the korma didnt work for me. I found the gravy too runny and the meat a little insipid. The Muzaffar sewain (Rs. 300 a box  450g and serves 7-8 people), on the other hand, was superb, and gave a pleasantly sweet end to what was a veritable feast.The rates are in kilos. The Lucknowi mutton biryani  which serves 5-6 people is for Rs. 1400 a kilo, the chicken biryani for Rs. 1200 a kilo. Hyderabadi mutton biryani is for Rs. 1600 a kilo and chicken biryani Rs. 1400 a kilo. The mutton qorma, which serves 10, is for Rs. 1800 a kilo. A plate of mutton shami kababs  one kilo with 40 pieces  costs Rs. 1500. The baghare baigan is for Rs. 1000 a kilo and serves 10, says the rate card.Taam is an online platform run by Asra Ahmad. It takes orders on phone and online. The phone numbers are 8586030554 and 9953170590. The email id is order@taamonline.com, and the website is www.taamonline.com. You have to order your food at least a day in advance, and they take delivery charges as applicable. The bawarchis of Taam have been trained by the family, and a cook is there from Hyderabad as well.My friend from Bhopal was not wrong. You wont be disappointed, he had said. And I certainly wasnt."

GOVARTHANM_GOVARTHANChildren of Kuttaiyur village located on the Kadambur hills on the Tamil Nadu  Karnataka border have dreams to study and come up in life. However, in the absence of road connectivity and public transportation to reach the Government Higher Secondary School in Kadambur, they discontinue their studies after Class VIII. Boys become labourers and girls are married off even before they complete 18 years.The village that comes under Bargur Panchayat in Anthiyur Taluk has a population of 450 and is located 27 km from Kadambur. Since most of the area is in forest, only mud roads are there. While three TNSTC bus services are operated in a day till Makkampalayam in Koothampalayam panchayat in Sathyamangalam block, villagers have to depend on a pick up vehicle to reach their village which is 5 km from Makkampalayam.The mud road that leads to the village is in a pathetic condition as it has been damaged by jungle streams and rainwater. The vehicle operator, who charges Rs. 25 per person for a trip, had dumped clay soil at a few places so that the vehicle could pass through it.The Government Tribal Residential School in the village was started in 1991 as elementary school and was upgraded as middle school in 2011. Currently, 27 boys and 26 girls study from Class 1 to 8.Though the sanctioned teachers strength is four, the headmaster is the only staff for the past seven years. He is also in-charge for the tribal school at Kathirimalai, about 100 km from the school. He travels twice a week there. Though its a residential school, in the absence of hostel facilities, students are sent home after serving food in the evening.Sanappan, president of Parents Teachers Association, said that a temporary staff, appointed six months ago was also not paid. Even the rice bags for noon meal scheme were to be brought from Bargur for which the headmaster had to pay Rs. 1,500 every month. Since reaching Kadambur every day is arduous, on an average eight students discontinue their studies after Class 8. While boys go for work at brick kiln units and garment units, child marriages were performed for girls, he added.S. Mupeena and P. Soundarya are among the girls who had discontinued their studies last year and earn Rs. Rs. 100 to Rs. 125 a day by working in agricultural fields. Kasi, a parent, said that safety of their children forced them to send their wards to work. If road facility is available, we will send them to schools.C. Duraisamy, deputy secretary, Tamil Nadu Tribal People Association, wanted the school to be upgraded as high school and teachers vacancies filled immediately. He also wanted the village to be brought under the Koothampalayam panchayat so that their journey to Bargur, located 60 km away, is avoided. He sought tar-topped roads from the village to Kadambur."

When we [Congress] came to power in 2013, Karnataka was at the 11th position, with Gujarat at the top, in terms of attracting investments. Now, Karnataka has risen to occupy the first place with an annual investment of Rs. 1.5 lakh crore as compared to Gujarats Rs. 40,000 crore. It is because of our development, infrastructure and transparency in governance that we became the most-preferred investment destination in the country. We are the leading State in terms of silk production, Information Technology and Bio-Technology [outputs]. Our public transport system was well recognised and appreciated with 207 national and international awards. Karnatakas GDP [Gross Domestic Product] growth is impressive at 8.5% as compared to national average of 7.1%. Household electrification has crossed 98% in Karnataka as compared to national average of just 88%. We are the only State in the country to give 7 kg rice free of cost to 3.85 crore people every month. Gujarat is nowhere near us in terms of development and it is Karnataka that has become a role model to others, he said.100% commission govt.Mr. Siddaramaiah came down heavily on BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP national president Amit Shah and partys Chief Ministerial candidate for the State B.S. Yeddyurappa on the issue of corruption.When Mr. Modi came to Bengaluru recently, I had expected that he would announce a waiver of farm loans [borrowed from nationalised banks] and provide a solution to the Mahadayi dispute. Contrary to my expectations, he, however, baselessly alleged that ours was a 10% commission government. I countered his allegations by claiming that theirs was a 90% commission government. Now, I would like to correct it to say that it is a 100% commission government, he said, and added that a number of Ministers and BJP leaders, including Mr. Yeddyurappa, had landed in jail for corruption.

5b16bde79855b72ada088923,Stuffed with metaphors,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/stuffed-with-metaphors/article22872936.ece,2018-02-28,"Passionate about theatre, Faezeh Jalali is well known for espousing the cause of issue-based plays. Marrying the two, the versatile theatre practitioner has staged plays that entertain even as they provoke audience to contemplate. These include Jaal , Objects In The Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear and Im Every Woman among others. Theatre is a catalyst for change. While entertaining it must make viewers analyse and reflect, she comments, as we settle down for a luncheon interaction at the National School of Dramas Food Court. Adding to her evocative works is her latest, ShikhandiThe Story of the In-Betweens , staged at the ongoing 8th Theatre Olympics. Written and directed by Faezeh, it is a comic, tongue-in-cheek retelling of the story of Shikhandi, perhaps one of the earliest trans-charaters in mythology.Recounting how Shikhandi took shape, Faezeh says, while reading the epic, she was really enamoured by Shikhandi. Meant to be born male to avenge an insult in past life as Amba, she is reborn as female, raised a male and has a sex change. It was not just that aspect but the human struggle for identity and finding a voice that brought me close to Shikhandi, explains Faezeh. She strongly identified with Shikhandis struggle since as a girl she too encountered gender bias. Fond of cricket, I was not allowed by boys to join the game. They would ask me to play with dolls or stand outside the field to fetch the ball. I found this humiliating. It irked me when boys were told not to cry like girls. What has tears got to do with gender? she asks.Despite complete freedom from parents, others reminded her of being a girl. I was told repeatedly to conduct myself with grace. All this left an indelible mark. Youll be surprised to know that even today many are unable to accept that I am a director. Having suffered discrimination, made Faezeh understand transgenders situation better. It made me empathise with their pain, which they undergo because they did not fit the so called normal gender slot.Asked to order, Faezeh promptly requests for aloo and paneer parathas. I love the stuffed parathas they make in Delhi. I make it a point to have them whenever in the Capital. Continuing about her journey with Shikhandi , it is surprising to know that initially it was a one-person device for just 20 minutes which is now a 90 minute play with eight actors. The first draft was written in 2010 but in 2014 after my breakup I rewrote and expanded it to include more characters. Break-up always spurs your creative juices, she jests.Daunting taskAgreeing it was daunting task to turn a long play, she reveals, In the theatrical sense it was challenging to locate the dramatic quality which is necessary to ensure the play is engaging and flows. The story states that Shikhandi unable to consummate his marriage is helped by a Yaksha. From drama perspective why did the Yaksha do that, there has to be some justification. In the story I wrote, the Yaksha himself is struggling with sexuality. Moreover, I found back stories for every character and incident in the epic which I wove in the play.With piping hot parathas with chutney and boondi raita arriving, we take a break. Relishing the food in small bites, Faezeb informs she loves eating rajma chawal and gol gappe in Delhi. Not what is offered at the star hotels but on roadside eateries. It is simply yummy! I am not very fastidious about the eating place as long it is clean. Raised in Mumbai and having studied theatre in the US for more than six years, Faezeh has developed a liking for other cuisines too. Her choicest cuisine is of course Iranian. Being an Iranian, I prefer chelow kababs which has rice, kababs, butter and raw egg and tahchin the Persian baked cake which has yogurt, saffron, egg and chicken fillets. Liking them so much, she must know how to prepare them They are made best by my mother. I can guess what she has prepared simply by the fragrance at home. I did learn cooking but took it seriously in the US where I couldnt survive on pizzas and burgers. Through hit and trial and recipes, I learnt from mother. I can cook vegetarian and non-vegetarian biryanis, pao baji and curd rice. The last is a surprise. I first tasted from my roomy, a Malayali. I loved it and learnt how to make it. I can simply live on curd rice through the year, she grins.Elements of Indian artContinuing on her culinary skills, Faezeh reveals she loves to experiment with cooking the way she does with her theatre. The only problem is after whipping up something delicious I am unable to recall the ingredients and their quantity. That cant be the case in theatre as well. No way. In plays, I try incorporate elements of Indian art and folk forms with a contemporary touch. In Shikhandi , I have used Kalaripayattu, Yakshagana, Koodiyattam and Bharatanatyam gestures to explain the text and dialogues in English. Likewise, the fight sequences have elements of Kalaripayattu while the choreography has many facets of Bharatanatyam. My training in West has prepared me physically, made me capable to analyse script and go beyond the text, I still intuitively identify with Indian stories, epics, legends, myths and art forms. An amazing, rich and varied treasure trove dating back several centuries is what should inspire us and not the West. Not trained in these forms, Faezeh has attended several workshops and reads extensively about them.The costumes used in Shikhandi too attracted lot of attention. Yes, they are mix of traditional and contemporary and are same for men and women. The dhoti is in Yakshagana style with embellishments, short above the knee. There is a belt around the dhoti which covers the crotch area. The top has a feminine contemporary cut, one shoulder top which is like a sari blouse but sleeveless. That symbolises the feminine while the dhoti masculine. The reason is to reflect the concept of ardhanarishvara, both male and female attributes in us, just like Shikhandi.Casting transgendersWhile preparing for the play, Faezeh did think about casting transgender actors. I had met Living Vidya, a fine actor, who I was keen to cast. Likewise, a Kathak dancer and five others I had auditioned were excellent dancers and performers. All of them were keen but needed money to take care of their families and self. Short of funds, I couldnt immediately offer salary or allowance. It was a great loss.These interactions helped Faezeh in reflecting their plight. I realised how economic independence is vital for transgenders to be able to fulfil their dreams and ambitions. Many of the insights I gained in their life and struggle have found their way into the play. For example, when Shikhandi tries to tell Dhrupad, his father, about his gender confusion, the latter immediately suggests marriage as a solution. That is exactly how parents and family react when a person declares himself to be gay or lesbian. They think marriage will remove the confusion. There is more to transgenders than we know.With the parathas over, the staff suggests cheese vegetable grilled sandwiches. Yes, I will taste them. As I love the ones made in Mumbai, it will remind me of my city, she avers.Reflecting on her journey, Faezeh says, it has been a learning curve. Acting under ace directors like Rehan Engineer, Rajat Kapoor, Rodney Umlas and Pearl Padamsee, I picked up finer nuances of the craft and how to handle actors, be creative, open to suggestions and passionate about stage. Likewise, watching other plays, has exposed me to different forms of presentation. Besides, new content pushes you to become inquisitive. In this Olympics, I was amazed to know about Kalbeliyas life and their disappearing livelihood in Sabir Khans Doodhan .Having acted in films like Qissa and Slumdog Millionaire and TV show Mahi Way , Faezeh does not view them very differently.

Their members will arrive in Delhi to express their anguish under the current NDA rule.Budget no solaceHe said the Budget offered nothing for the farmers as there was no significant increase in the allocations.The much-waited 50% extra on minimum support price is yet to be implemented. The suggestions of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee have been ignored as they favour the farmers, he said. He said while Prime Minister Narender Modi promised to double the income of the farmers by 2022, his efforts were only helping the corporate sector and insurance companies.Many crops in the country such as green gram, black gram, bengal gram, and rice have witnessed a bumper yield, but the farmers are forced to sell them for 35% less as there is no market for the produce, he said."

Those unhappy over some DPC employees demanding money from them, however, have shown interest in selling their produce to private traders.A large number of middlemen  working for rice traders  are camping in different parts of Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts for procuring paddy directly from farmers. Armed with scales and load carriers, they shift their procurement locations periodically depending on demand. Unlike the system being followed in DPCs, farmers dispose of their produce to private merchants at their doorstep.In Tiruvarur district, more than 50 persons have been camping in Velukkudi, Kamalapuram, Rathinakudi, Kombur and neighbouring villages.The merchants mainly procure short-term varieties such as ASD-16, CR-1050, Co-51 and NLR, and medium-term varieties mainly BPT-5204. According to a rough estimate, they have so far procured more than 2 lakh tonnes since harvest began in the first week of February.The merchants offer Rs. 890 per bag of ASD-16 and CR-1050 paddy varieties. The offer price for BPT is hovering around Rs. 1,050 per bag. However, the rate for BPT variety is said to be Rs. 150 less than last year.Farmers, who sold paddy to private players at Velukkudi, alleged that they were forced to deduct Rs. 40 per bag at many DPCs. Moreover, there was the possibility of price reduction on account of discoloured and damaged paddy. Hence, they preferred private merchants to DPCs.We are paid on the spot by private merchants. We do not need to bear the transportation charges as they procure paddy at our doorstep said A. Mahendran.D. Rengarajan of Velukudi, a trader, said the procurement was in full swing. Although a section of farmers were severely hit due to lack of water in some areas of Tiruvarur district, production was better than last year in general. The procurement would continue for two to three weeks."

Hariprasad, who belongs to Karnataka, said, The manifesto committee is meeting with different sections to get a sense of peoples expectation and incorporate them in our manifesto.The party will focus on popular schemes such as Ksheer Bhagya that offered free milk to children from economically weaker families, Anna Bhagya that offered rice and the Indira canteen.Prestige battleThe election schedule for the 224-member Karnataka Assembly is yet to be announced but it is building up as a prestige battle. While BJP chief Amit Shah has already been touring the State, Mr. Gandhi would kick-off the partys campaign with a three-day tour beginning on February 10.Karnataka is expected to witness a triangular contest with the Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal (Secular) also in the fray.

Maybe this is because there are quite a few things that Ive refused to put in my mouth. Over the years its become a perverse fascination of mine to see what other people hate to eat. Perhaps this started when, as a kid, I developed a deep disgust for ghee  not a good aberration in a child with a Gujarati Vaishnav background. Well into adulthood I would recoil at any sight of ghee, whether it was being put in diyas for puja, spread on thin Gujju rotis or some mother/aunt-type culinary sergeant was attempting to sully my precious aamras with a drizzle of this melted hell-produce. My mom was unmoved and caustically pointed out the sheer idiocy of my attempting a ghee-mukt diet: You lovemagas(a typical Gujarati sweet) and it is full of ghee! Or: You love your Punjabi food and a lot of it is made with ghee! (A really sore point for her was not that I liked Punjabi vegetarian grub but that I ranked it on par with Gujju food.) My point was, as long as I couldnt see it, it was fine, but the visuals were intolerable, setting off a chain of retching in my throat.Food phobiasI was a weird kid. I hated ghee, rice andbaingan, but I lovedkarelaand the umami of vaal ni daal . Of my two sons, the older one decided at the advanced age of three to keep his fathers perversity but not for the same food. For the longest time I couldnt put any tomato-based product in front of him, namely, anything in which you could discern the offending red fruit. Would he eat pizza? Ye-es. Not as enthusiastically as other kids but he would eat it. Pasta sauce with tomato elements? Yes, as long as it was paste. Tomato salad? No way. Ketchup? No, wed have violence if there was any on the table.Then there is a friend of mine, S, a Gujju and a food lover from the same background as mine, for whom the kryptonite effect comes from just seeing coriander. Again, this is extreme cultural treason from a Gujju, but there it is. Forget about actual cilantro, we friends can torture him simply by posting photos of the green stuff on his Facebook page. How can a Gujju not love kothmir ? people ask him. S just smiles and says: But I love fish like a Bengali! At one point, S explained to me with the aid of a scientific website how the leaf actually sets off a semi-allergic reaction in him. Again, if he cant see it or smell it, hes fine. So no chopped coriander on his dhoklas, but if I use it as part of a paste in a daal hell eat it happily.Speaking of cultural traitors, people who know Im into food often ask me about the fact that I wont eat anything that has had any activity in water. People who dont know me well often ask: What kind of a Bengali doesnt love fish? My answer is simple: Im not a Bengali. I may have sloughed off my strict vegetarian upbringing, I may revel in eating all sorts of meat (yes, that kind and also that other kind), but this Pesciphobia is perhaps a remaining trace of my core childhood. Next question: How can you be a foodie and not explore seafood? A shifty Lefty once said: Im not a Marxist but Im a student of Marx. My reply goes: Im not a foodie but a spectator of foodie-ism. Which, of course, brings me to my Bong foodie friend who also doesnt much like fish. This friend, N, has even made a long documentary about Bengalis and fish, and he will lecture you knowledgeably about all the thousand varieties of fish available in the delta and how Bengalis of different persuasion (Ghoti or Bangal) like to cook them, but he will rarely touch the slippery suspects himself.Phobias shiftThe thing Ive noticed about these phobias is that they shift. Today, Son No. 1 is a reasonably good cook and he even uses tomatoes sometimes, though you can still get him to comply to demands by waving a bottle of ketchup. N is gradually beginning to include fish in his cooking repertoire, even though he himself barely eats it. Another friend, who used to find European cheese difficult to comprehend, is now, under direct pressure from a romantic and emotional direction, starting to discuss the joys of chvre, brie, pecorino and manchego. The other day, I found myself at a new restaurant trying and really liking some beautifully cooked crustaceans, lobsterish white pulp, glittering black eggs and all. Well before that, I discovered the joys of proper, naked ghee, the nice one my local milk-wala makes, the beautifully fragrant variety you get from Mysore, and even the superb organic one produced at a farm in Suffolk that costs 10 for a small jar. As N has demonstrated to me, decent ghee is central to a first course in Bong food, mixed with plain, hot rice plus some crisp, bitter element such as karela , thus creating a dtente between what Ive always loved and till recently hated. Does this mean I foresee S soon relishing a crown of coriander on a ceviche? No, that may take some time, but S has promised that the day a certain other pair of Gujaratis are forced to loosen their grip on power, he will eat something with a garnish of kothmir."

5b16fc5a9855b75cf6a8f687,An enduring rista,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/an-enduring-rista/article23018327.ece,2018-03-10,"A wonderful aroma that wafts in from a floor above our flat every now and then stops me in my tracks. I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

It has a rich collection of cocktails and foods menus, he said.This brand new facility is poised to grow rapidly due to the evolving city culture, and as the floating population is getting bigger with the growing importance of Vijayawada, Mr. Teja said.On the customer choices, Mr. Teja said, as a concept, microbrewery was fast catching up across the country and the response had been impressive in A.P., which started issuing licence recently.The advantage of a microbrewery was that different flavours of beer could be brewed in-house and changed according to seasons or market preference with fresh ingredients such as apple, chocolate, mango, lemon, blueberries, coffee, and even rice and wheat without chemicals."

He used to frequently draw something on it, reacting to current issues. All his life as an artist, he had worked that way, letting his art do the talking whenever he wanted to convey something to society.This naturally led him to street art. A couple of years back, people who came out on the Sulthanpalya Main Road in north Bangalore in the morning had the shock of their lives when they saw a life-size crocodile bang in the middle of a large pothole. That was Nanjundaswamys protest against the bad condition of the roads in the city, which earned him the name crocodile artist.On another occasion, he painted a picture of Yamaraj with his mouth centred on an open manhole. Both the art works evoked swift response from the civic authorities, who repaired the pothole and the manhole. The artist was in the city this weekend as part of the Dhwani art and cultural festival organised by the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram.A wide wall became his canvas here. Titled rice thieves, the art work was his reaction to the murder of tribal youth, Madhu, by a mob in Attapady recently. The image also becomes a critique of the developmental model, which has resulted in shrinking paddy fields.Stealing food is not a crime. It is a desperate act of survival. It is unimaginable cruelty to kill someone for stealing food, says Mr. Nanjundaswamy.Without a steady income at home, he had taken to painting banners and signboards soon after school to support his mother.After school, there was no one to guide me. My family was very poor. I decided that I should take up serious education in art and joined the Chamarajendra Academy of Visual Arts (CAWA) in Mysore, he says.Later, he got a job at a major advertising firm. But he quit after a few years to do his own thing as freelancer. He picked up from the internet the basic lessons in three-dimensional street art, which made him famous. That gave instant popularity, and brought instant response from the authorities. What took months of protests and memorandums was solved by his 3D drawings.Nanjundaswamy also works as an art director in Kannada films.A book of his short stories in Kannada will be released soon."

Plates are arranged and food from a makeshift kitchen is brought here. It is then that Azhar Maqsoosi, the man behind the Hunger Has No Religion campaign begins to serve food to them as if they were his own.On Saturday, the campaign entered 2,163rd day. Sitting in his modest one-room shop, the pensive 38 year old recounts the genesis of the campaign.My father passed away when I was four years old. My mother raised me and my five siblings with much difficulty and there were days when we went hungry. Soon I realised what hunger was and thats when I decided to fight it, he says.While the campaign had its humble beginning in the city, Mr. Maqsoosi says it has now spread to other States such as Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and now, Assam. His Facebook page keeps his followers informed of the daily developments.Speaking in the straightforward Dakhni idiom, Mr. Maqsoosi says the campaign was built on goodwill. The support of volunteers and collaboration from other organisations has taken it forward. The dastarkhwaan at Dabeerpura and at Gandhi Hospital  which has entered the 896th day  is a daily affair. In Assam, it is weekly which is in its 30th week now. We have also partnered with an NGO in Bengaluru which is seeing its 505th day near Siddipura police station, he says. Dastarkhwaan in Urdu means a table cloth or great spread  apt for Maqsoosis generosity. The typical meal is a simple fare of plain rice and Hyderabadi khatti daal . Sometimes, theres zeera rice and occasionally bottle gourd gets added to the daal , just enough to satiate a persons hunger. About 60 kilos of rice goes into feeding the hungry souls every day.Mr. Maqsoosis work has attracted even the attention of Bollywood star Salman Khan. Last month, he was invited for an interaction with the actor. The Being Human Clothing representatives informed me that I have been nominated to meet the actor. When I met Salman Khan, I told him how my wife and I began serving home-cooked food to the homeless in 2012 and today we serve food to around 300 people in Hyderabad alone. He appreciated our work, he says.Fund-raising has not been a problem for Mr. Maqsoosi except in the initial days. When people realised his genuine work, kindred spirits flocked to help.My friends on social media have helped me a lot. They have always come forward for the cause. Its only about the cause and nothing else. They understand that irrespective of faith, hunger is real. No person should sleep on an empty stomach, he says."

Joshua, a social worker of Anaikkatti, told The Hindu people were suffering due to under-weighment and short supply of essentials from these shops. If a beneficiary bought 2 kg of sugar, it would have a shortage of at least 200 g, and under-weighment was more in rice.As most of the families were coming under the below poverty line, they had antyodaya category of PDS cards.They were eligible to draw 35 kg of rice a month. The family cardholders were able to draw the same in two instalments many times due to short supply.Besides, family card holders living in over 10 remote villages deep inside Reserve Forest in Thoomanur and Kattusalai were unable to trek for a few km to buy ration.VehiclesThe THADCO had allocated six mobile vans which were not used properly, alleged Mr. Joshua.A vehicle allocated was kept idle for all these year and was parked in a place in Vadakkalur. Another vehicle assigned for the purpose of mobile PDS shop was seized by the Indian Overseas Bank, Thadagam branch, as its owner was unable to pay monthly EMIs, he added.When contacted, District Supply Officer P. Jayarani maintained that the mobile shops were being run through the ration shops located in remote villages and they had no knowledge about the vans allocated by THADCO. On the complaints about under-weighment and short supply, she said that Taluk Supply Officer Saravanan visited the shops on Saturday and warned the salesmen."

At present, the distribution of food grains through fair price shops in the state is being monitored by a three-member committee randomly picked by the department. The proposed committees will have social standing committee chairman of the respective GPs as its chairperson along with three members and a member secretary. The department will select two members  one from SC/ST and one from general category. While a GP member will also be a member of the monitoring committee, it will have the panchayat development officer ( PDO ) as its member secretary, the minister said the tenure of the committee will be of three years.The committee will meet ration card holders on seventh of every month. One of the members of the committee will have the powers to solve problems related to biometric impression and issues pertaining to distribution of food grains. Every consignment of rice to fair price shops should be approved by one of the members on arrival. Further, the committee will also be holding Aahaar Adalats and training for ration dealers and members once in three months, Khader said.The proposal has been submitted to the government. The proposed committees will ensure transparency in distribution of food grains, he said adding that it will be cleared after a discussion in the cabinet. The department also has plans to observe Food Month in August every year. All processes like addition and deletion of names from ration cards and other issues will be solved during the month, he added."

Accused  mill owner Gulshan Jain, sons Nitin and Sudhir and daughters-in-law Nitu and Sophiya  have gone into hiding.A Rs 33.6 crore alleged paddy scam has pitted the state government and Punjab National Bank (PNB) against each other, each, in its bid to recover losses, staking claim in the left out stock and recoveries from the buildings and assets mortgaged by Veerumal Mulkhraj Jain Rice Mill to the bank. Accused  mill owner Gulshan Jain, sons Nitin and Sudhir and daughters-in-law Nitu and Sophiya  have gone into hiding.While the PNB approached Amritsar court seeking directions that the left out paddy should not be disposed of without taking it on board; Punjab Vigilance department took over the probe into the case from Amritsar (rural) police Tuesday.On April 2, food and civil supplies department noticed that 1,200 truckloads of government paddy worth Rs 33.6 crore was missing. The rice mill, now stands locked, was to shell the paddy to convert into rice, which was to be eventually supplied to Food Corporation of India.On April 5, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had ordered a Vigilance probe into the case. Same day, Amritsar (rural) police registered a case of cheating against Jain, his two sons and their wives.The left out paddy worth nearly Rs 15 crore was subsequently recovered.Satyawan Ohlan, PNBs circle head in Amritsar, said the missing paddy could be the private purchases of the miller, or varieties of paddy 1509 and 1121 that government did not procure or the one belonging to previous seasons and in those scenarios cannot be termed as government paddy.Food and Civil Supplies Director Anindita Mitra, however, said the stock of the mill was zero at the start of Kharif season procurement. So there is no question either that there was any government paddy of previous season, she said .The PNB has marked an internal probe also. Zonal Manager P S Chauhan said the bank had initiated proceedings to recover the money. The PNB also approached Punjab police for registration of a case, alleging fraud/embezzlement of Rs 202 crore.Two mortgaged buildings are worth Rs 40 crore. Two plants have latest machinery and if one sets up such units today, it will require an investment of about Rs 100 crore. Another Rs 10 crore could be realised from the left out stock. The actual amount, which could be realised, may be between Rs 125 crore and Rs 140 crore, Ohlan said.Mitra, however, said since government paddy was siphoned off, only the state government was entitled to realise the losses after auction of the mortgaged property.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"
5b175ab89855b75cf6a8ffb8,"Indian farmers voted Modi to power in 2014, he can’t count on them in 2019",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/indian-farmers-voted-modi-to-power-in-2014-he-cant-count-on-them-in-2019-5203291/,2018-06-04,"The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was. The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo: Subham Dutta)AT SUPURDI in Purulia district, the house of the 21-year-old History (honours) student is known to everyone, not only because Trilochon Mahato was a BJP worker but also because he was the only one in the village to have a computer. However, the BJP had been a recent choice for the youth, who had emerged as the partys go-to man for painting graffiti, and who was found hanging from a tree near his home on May 30. He would always support a party in opposition to the government of the state, and the 21-year-olds 7-by-5 ft room is still adorned with a photo of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi.Just 10 km away in Dava village, Dulal Kumar, 30, died under similar circumstances. The family refuses to believe the police claim of suicide.READ | West Bengal BJP workers death: Then Maoists were after our lives. Now its the TMCDulal, a father of three, and Trilochon may have had little in common, but there was one crucial link that joined them: both had joined the BJP just before the panchayat polls in their Balarampur block, in which the party would go on to win seven gram panchayat sansads, 17 of 20 panchayat seats and two zilla parishads.It was during the Ram Navmi celebrations in March, organised on a big scale by the Bajrang Dal for the first time in Purulia, that Trilochon first got involved with the BJP. Family members, who describe him as a rebel, say Trilochon had been a Congress supporter during the CPM regime, but after the Trinamool Congress came to power, had started focusing on his studies as well as opened a catering business, which was doing well.READ | BJP worker in Bengal found hanging, note left on bodyIn the wake of the Bajrang Dals huge Ram Navmi rallies, many local youths including Trilochon had got swept into the BJP fold here. A large number of them later joined the party just a month before the panchayat polls. Trilochon was made the pramukh of a Booth Suraksha (booth protection) committee.While Balarampur had seen sporadic violence between TMC and BJP, Bajrang Dal workers during the panchayat polls, there was no major incident in Supurdi. The BJP had claimed to have thwarted attempts to storm polling booths in some areas.Trilochons parents Hariram and Pano at Supurdi. (Photo: Subham Dutta) Trilochons parents Hariram and Pano at Supurdi. (Photo: Subham Dutta)On May 30, Trilochons body was found along with a message, written on his T-shirt as well as on a paper attached to it, saying he was killed for daring to join the BJP. He had gone missing the evening before.READ | One more BJP worker found dead, West Bengal CID to probePolice have confirmed Trilochon was murdered, but attribute it to personal enmity. Joy Biswas, who has since been shifted out as Purulia Superintendent of Police, refused to elaborate on this, while his replacement, Akash Magharia, declined comment.Trilochons father Hariram Mahato said police were trying to hush up the matter. I know he had no enmity with anyone. He had been threatened by TMC workers. After the BJPs win, there was a victory celebration in the village. Trilochon had played a major role in organising it. Some people didnt like that, he said.Trilochons brother Shibnath claimed he had received a call from Trilochon around 8.15 pm on the day he went missing to say he was being abducted.A heartbroken Hariram, 58, said the family had vested all its hopes in Trilochon, the youngest of his four sons. I work at a shop in Balarampur bazar. Two of my sons left their studies to work outside the state. We spent all we earned on him. We hoped at least Trilochon would study and become someone some day.The evening he went missing, the family said, Trilochon had gone to Balarampur town, about 8 km away, on his bicycle to photocopy some papers for a coming examination. Around 8 pm, Trilochon reportedly called up brother Shibnath to say some people were forcibly dragging him to a jungle nearby.At Dava village, Dulals 29-year-old wife Monika sits in a state of shock holding their three children, Aditya (11), Pooja (9) and Adarsh (7). Like Trilochon, Dulal had drifted to the BJP after participating in the March Ram Navmi rallies, and turned up dead a day after he went missing. He was found hanging from a high-tension wire, about a kilometre his home, on June 2.A team of five doctors did the postmortem at Purulia Sadar hospital. It is clearly written due to asphyxia, due to hanging, antemortem and suicidal in nature, said SP Magharia.Dulals family members and villagers say he could not have killed himself, pointing to the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. Said Monika, Would a person leave his motorbike a kilometre away, with the keys in it, and walk all the way to hang himself? Police are lying Why would he commit suicide? He had no problems at home, no financial crisis.She also claimed threats from the TMC. Just a day before he was abducted and killed, local TMC workers had threatened him.According to the family members, on June 1, the day Dulal went missing, he had participated in the BJPs state-wide Thana Gherao programme to protest against Trilochons killing. In the evening, he left with food for his father, who was at the family shop of paddy rice cutter machine about a kilometre away. The family, that is relatively well-off, also owns a ration shop.He was very active in politics and that is why he was targeted. Police took away seven TMC men from the village for interrogation, but no one has been arrested, said Dinabandhu Kumar, a nephew of Dulal.Denying TMC involvement in the deaths, general secretary Partha Chatterjee said on Sunday, The postmortem report (of Dulal) has made it clear it is a case of suicide. The BJP is trying to create trouble by alleging murder.BJP state secretary Sayantan Basu said, We want the two cases to be handed over to the CBI or we will move court.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

District officials said the womans family did not have a ration card but are probing whether a formal application for the same had been submitted.According to officials, Savitri Devi, a resident of Mangargaddi village in Dumri, died on Saturday. However, they were only informed about the death after her younger son, Hulas Mahato, reached home on Sunday. An investigation is underway to probe Devis death, they said.Executive Magistrate and Dumri Block Development Officer (in-charge) Rahul Dev said, We reached her home on Sunday afternoon. The administration was not informed about it earlier. Prima facie, there was no food in the house. The family did not have ration card. We are probing whether an application was submitted and, if so, whether it was properly processed.Officials are also probing as to why the woman, or any other member of her family, was reportedly not getting any other government benefits.Ram Prasad Mahato, mukhiya (village headman) of Chainpur Panchayat, under which Mangargaddi falls, said, Savitris elder daughter-in-law had come to me about two months ago for verification of her ration card application. I had verified it. But I dont know whether she submitted it in the block office or not.Mahato claimed that his mother has not been receiving pension in the last three years despite being selected under a scheme for widows in 2014. He said that after his fathers death in 2010, the little produce they got from a small family-owned farm barely lasted for two-to-three months. And the partly stipend he was earning through an apprenticeship program in Uttar Pradesh was also not sufficient to feed the family, he added.My elder brother was not getting salary regularly, while I was getting paid stipend that was too little. The last I talked, the food grain had been managed from a self-help group in the village. But it too had finished-off and for nearly three days, no food was cooked in the house, he told The Indian Express.Mahato said his elder brothers wife, her three children, his wife and their daughter lived together with his mother.Following Devis death, a local dealer has arranged about 50 kg of rice for the family of eight, he said. The family has requested the administration to not send the body for postmortem but cremate it.A womens self-help group also provided three kgs of rice for the family before Devi died.Sunita Devi, one of the core group members of Maa Kali Swayam Sahayata Samooh (Maa Kali Self-Help Group), said, Around eight days ago, Savitris elder daughter-in-law had called me asking if we could be of some help, as there was no food grain in the house. We managed to provide her three kgs at that time. We were again supposed to meet on Tuesday, this week, and could have arranged for more. But, in the meantime, Savitri died. With a family of seven to feed that amount was obviously not enough.Meanwhile, Food and Supplies Minister Saryu Roy has directed the Deputy Commissioner for a detailed report by a senior official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Free distribution of food is a feature of the hospital.H. VibhuNormal life was thrown out of gear and trade and industrial sectors in the commercial hub of Kochi came to a grinding halt in the State-wide strike called by trade unions on Monday in protest against the Union governments labour policy permitting companies to hire and fire.While public transport was hit keeping private and KSRTC buses, autorickshaws and taxis off the road, private vehicles were out in large numbers and were more or less allowed to operate freely. As hotels and restaurants remained shut, people who had to work and those reaching railway stations had a tough time.Social worker Murugan distributed rice gruel to the hungry as his vehicle supplying the food reached important points like Kaloor, Palarivattom, Ernakulam South railway station and Kacherippady.The coordination committee of trade unions staged protest marches across the district even as they claimed the strike to be a runaway success.Protest marches were held at 32 centres across the district. CITU national secretary K. Chandran Pillai inaugurated the protest march in the city.Workers arrestedThe arrest of 25-odd workers who had struck work and were preparing to stage a protest march by Infopark police led to some tense moments.They were released at the intervention of trade union leaders who took up the matter with the Assistant Commissioner of Police.Strike took its toll on the functioning of public sector enterprises like the Cochin Port Trust, Vallarpadam International Container Transshipment Terminal, Cochin Shipyard, Kochi Refinery, HOCL, etc. While all offices in the Civil Station functioned, the staff strength remained low. Some firms, including a bank, had to down the shutters at the direction of protesting workers.Tension at exam centreTension prevailed in front of a school at Ponnurunni hosting a PSC exam after the organisers of the exam rejected the demand of those who accompanied the candidates to allow a room within the school to rest during the course of the exam in view of the strike. Police soon emerged on the scene following heated exchanges but the organisers didnt budge and, in keeping with the practice during PSC exams, locked the gate by leaving out all except the candidates taking the exam that lasted between 10.30 a.m. and 12.15 p.m.The acquaintances of candidates, including women with toddlers, had a tough time as they were left to brave scorching heat without food or water as all shops and hotels remained closed owing to the strike. They also questioned the decision to hold the exam on a strike day."

He was addressing a public rally in Dantewada to flag off Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singhs Vikas Yatra, which aims to highlight the achievements of the BJPs 15-year rule in the state. The Union home minister said despite the hurdles put up by the Maoist rebels, the Centre and the state government were committed to boosting development in the region. He praised the Chhattisgarh chief minister, saying the state had witnessed tremendous growth under his leadership.Singh said he had never seen a chief minister with so much concern for all sections of the society, including the masons, carpenters, tendu leaf collectors, women and students. But forces like Naxals do not want development to take place. They are misleading the tribals and poor people, he said. Singh expressed his gratitude to the tribal communities that had shown the courage to reject the Naxal ideology and refused to quit the mainstream.Alleging that Naxal leaders were wallowing in luxury, he said they were, however, preventing the progress meant for the tribals and the poor. Naxal leaders have become crorepatis. They send their children to study in prominent colleges and universities. Some of their children even study abroad. But they want the children of our tribal brothers to remain uneducated, Singh said.Stating that the state and the country would not progress without the development of the tribals and the poor, the home minister said, We have decided that despite all odds, we will go to the (Naxal-affected) area and build roads, set up mobile towers, provide potable water, electricity, medical facilities and education. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states believe that no one can imagine the development of a state or the country unless the poor, the backward and tribals prosper. He said the people of Chhattisgarh were aware of the progress the state had made in 15 years of BJP rule and that no force could mislead them.Singh said people from all over the country and abroad visited Chhattisgarh to see the efficient functioning of its Public Distribution System, under which the poor were provided rice for Re 1 per kg. Praising the Centres steps to bring about a financial inclusion of those left out, he said the prime minister believed that not just the rich, but even the poorest must have bank accounts. Singh also claimed that no prime minister had ever done what Modi had managed to do in four years. He said the government was providing a health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh to the poor families, while the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana was facilitating houses for the poor. Singh urged the people of Chhattisgarh, where Assembly polls are due later in the year, to elect the BJP to power for the fourth consecutive time.Speaking on the occasion, Raman Singh said development works to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore would be launched during the Vikas Yatra, including distribution of smartphones among 50 lakh families as part of the states Sanchar Kranti Yojana. He asserted that development of the Bastar region, of which Dantewada district is a part, was always an important priority for his government.The prime minister launching the Ayushman Bharat  National Health Protection Mission, the worlds largest such insurance initiative, from Bastars Bijapur district only highlighted it, the chief minister said. The first phase of the Vikas Yatra will cover 62 Assembly constituencies and culminate on June 11, while the second phase is scheduled to be held from August 16 to September 30.

The final plan envisages having a total of a hundred such stalls across the state.We have chosen five places  the Ruby crossing, Gariahat, DLF in New Town, Shyambazar and Salt Lake  in the city, where people will get their lunch at Rs 21 only. This will start from March. There will be a hundred stalls across the state from May, a senior state food department official said.We will start with a set menu but have plans to give people more options at a later stage. The meals will be available at a specific time to start with but, at a later stage, we have plans to make this an all-day affair. We have tied up with the fisheries department and the agricultural marketing dep-artment for this, the official added.States like Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi and Rajasthan already have such schemes.

His entry has opened a new window for action thrillers where the stunt choreography aspires to match international standards. Recently in the Capital to introduce his Prowl workout at Cult Fitness club, he talks about his fitness philosophy, action genre in India and his latest release Baaghi-2 .Excerpts:How do you approach the fitness aspect of characters for different films?For Baaghi 2 , I had to learn a different kind of combat because it was a blend of kickboxing, taekwondo and Chinese boxing. I had to undergo weaponry training in an action master facility at Bangkok. In my diet, I had complex carbohydrates, high glycaemic index (GI) carbohydrates like rice and simple sugars after workout and a moderate to high amount of proteins. Now I am losing muscles for my role in Student of the Year-2 through intermittent fasting and focusing on cardiovascular activities done on an empty stomach in the morning. This uses fat as a source of energy. I eliminate all my carbohydrates and stick to fats from dry fruits like walnuts or a spoon of peanut butter in my whey protein.You have also co-created your own Prowl workout with Cult Fitness. How is it different?We are starting a workout based on movement that is a fusion of martial arts, dance, and functional training. When you grow muscles through weights, it is not the organic way. In a mixed approach, you build muscles but they do not just become a weight on your body. The workout helps you to move more efficiently and makes you more mobile. You feel lighter.Is martial arts a philosophy to you or just a fitness routine?For me, martial arts is a way of life. It has taught me not only about physicality, but also given me a sense of discipline in my daily life. So in a way, it is both a philosophy and a fitness routine for me. Martial arts techniques like punches and kicks are not only meant to make you a sportsperson but also boost your existing workout. I have incorporated that into my Prowl routine where you learn a skill like a dance or martial arts move as you do the exercise. It helps the cardiovascular endurance and it is fun because of the music.Who were your role models?I am inspired by Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Whatever fame I have earned so far is because of them. I watched Bruce Lees Enter the Dragon and Jackie Chans Rumble in the Bronx at a very early age. My father (Jackie Shroff) was very busy with film shootings, but my mother pushed me. Martial arts flowed with my body naturally and I felt like it was something that I was destined to do. I never used to think about the accolades but only the training. I became very popular in my school because of my stunts. I was not good in studies, but sports kept me engaged in school.How different it is being directed by a choreographer in Baaghi 2 ?People may presume that Ahmed Khan and Tiger Shroff can only make films on dance, but I am sure they will be shocked to see a film that has superb action sequences as well as an honest story to tell. It is a complete contrast to what Khan is.I am completely a directors actor but if the director gives me the freedom to improvise, I improvise too. The experience that Khan has built up all these years as a technician reflects in his work as a director. Instead of focusing on the kind of punch and kicks, he asked me to focus on the motivation behind those actions and translate that into my emotions.Any inspiration from Bollywood in this regard?I respect Hrithik Roshan for what he has managed to bring on screen through his on-screen presence, dialogue delivery and obviously, dance. I think he is a whole package, and I am a big fan.Do you think the action genre can withstand the wave of content-based cinema in Bollywood?I totally believe that action will not only compete but also win hearts of the masses. Be it Salman Khan, Ajay Devgn or the other superstars, they have always been macho action heroes and people relate to action the most because it is the loudest form of expression. See the craze for Chinese films in India where the viewers do not understand the aesthetics, but can relate to the action in the film.Violence and vendetta have lived for the longest time in cinemaThe blueprint of a hit film will remain the same and the newer filmmakers will recycle the same for the audiences who have contemporary sensibilities. You can watch any of the action films; they all have more or less the same larger idea and blueprint.Do you think that multiplex culture or video-on-demand platforms have questioned the larger-than-life hero?I think cinema theatre and its large canvas will always invite audiences to witness something which they cannot watch in their day-to-day life.The laptop or mobile phone cannot allow you to witness it even though the quality and content is good. The spectacle of a movie like Baahubali or a superhero film can sustain the larger-than-life aspect of cinema as viewers are totally engrossed in watching it on a big screen. .But only a few superhero films such as your Flying Jatt are made in IndiaWe lack the budgets. It is as simple as that. We have stories and emotional content in our superhero films but we do not have the resources to compete with the international standards of the visual effects and technology. We have tried and made Baahubali 2 , which is a matter of pride, but still, we are far away from Avengers. A superhero franchise is a tricky business because there is a direct comparison to international brands.I think cinema theatre and its large canvas will always invite audiences to witness something which they cannot watch in their day-to-day life"

It was published recently in the journal Global Environmental Change .A team of researchers from Austria, the U.S. and India, headed by Narasimha D. Rao from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Austria, used the National Sample Survey of Consumption Expenditure in India (2011-12) and the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau to examine Indian diets. They found that while nearly three-quarters of Indians consume less than the ideal number of calories a day, and more than half have protein deficiency, the deficiencies of micronutrients were more prevalent: nearly nine in 10 Indians are iron-deficient, 85% do not meet the required intake of vitamin A, and two-thirds have zinc deficiency.Cost was clearly a concern as deficiencies were found to decrease as household incomes increased. Surprisingly though, urban households had increased deficiencies compared to their rural counterparts (apart from vitamin A), which the researchers attribute to greater diversity of cereals in rural areas. Having identified 32 representational diets each for north, south, east and west India, the researchers found that the rice-based diets of south and east India make the people in these areas more vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies than people elsewhere.The researchers found that while those above the poverty line can make up for this nutritional inadequacy without their food budgets being affected much, nearly 160 million people below the poverty line cannot without exceeding their food budgets. The researchers try to address these concerns while proposing solutions.They suggest that the required micronutrients can be met by reducing the intake of rice (from 61% to around 40% of calorie share) and meat (expensive and with high greenhouse gas emissions) and replacing them with coarse cereals such as bajra and ragi, along with legumes, dark, leafy vegetables, and coconut. These dietary changes could also reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in India by up to 25%, the study shows."

Most two-wheeler and four wheeler users would take a diversion to reach till AV Bridge and get into regular traffic at Yanaikal Junction while small vehicles navigate till Raja Mill Road to reach Arapalyam Junction.But, the stretch between Kuruvikaransalai and AV Bridge, which was dug up for underground drainage (UGD) work last year, remains battered though the civic body has completed it. The road has not been laid again, causing hardship to road users.Till 1996, these roads on the river bank were encroached by slum-dwellers. During the DMK regime from 1996 to 2001, then assembly speaker, P T R Palanivel Rajan took efforts to clear these banks, and converted them into wide roads. During festival times as well as emergencies like road blockage, the river bank roads prove their usage, absorbing significant amount of traffic.Between these banks, Southern Bank Road houses several small scale industries, rice mills and furniture making units especially in Ismailpuram area. Trucks, including big ones attempt to navigate the stretch and get caught in potholes. It used to be an easy thoroughfare during traffic hours in Kamarajar Salai. Of late, at least one truck get struck here, blocking the road. So, I am forced to take Kamarajar Salai and cope with the traffic jam, rued S Siva , a resident of Kamajar Salai.Though corporation has completed UGD works, manholes overflow now and then, so corporation keeps working on them. When the road was laid, lot of vehicles used this stretch. Now it is a backbreaking task to ride in this stretch, recalled P Ponnusamy, a resident of Ismailpuram."

The agriculture ministry released its latest estimates on Tuesday, just when the government has been exploring various options of procuring more and more foodgrains from farmers in the year of plenty.Option of extending the government's guarantee to banks and lending agencies to ensure that state agencies do not face fund crunch for procurement is likely to come up before the Union Cabinet for approval on Wednesday.The move will help states go for procurement of pulses, oilseeds and cotton under the Price Support Scheme ( PSS ) through central nodal agencies and the other crops by state agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) without worrying about paucity of funds.The basic objectives of PSS are to provide remunerative prices to the growers with a view to encourage higher investment and production and safeguard interests of consumers by making available supplies at reasonable prices.Though the year is expected to report decline in production of wheat and oilseeds as compared to previous year (2016-17), the latest estimates gave a new hope amid reports of good sowing of winter crops ( Rabi ), except wheat, in December-January.The fall in wheat production can be attributed to farmers' decision to shift to pulses with the hope of better MSP. Farmers in Rajasthan, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh shifted to pulses during the Rabi season.The agriculture ministry, while releasing the second advance estimates of foodgrain production, attributed the record output in 2017-18 to ""near normal rainfall during 2017 monsoon and various policy initiatives taken by the government"".The ministry said that the assessment of production of different crops was ""based on the feedback received from states"". It claimed that the assessment was also ""validated with information available from other sources"".The ministry releases four advance estimates, before the final one which gives exact details of foodgrain output. The second estimates, released after completion of the Rabi sowing operations across the country, show that the production of wheat is likely to drop by 1.42% to estimated 97.11 MT. It is lower by 1.40 MT as compared to record wheat production of 98.51 MT achieved during 2016-17."

In the letter, the judge said it is shameful that such an incident has occurred in a civilized society.Based on the letter, the Chief Justice has directed for registering a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) regarding the lynching.Lynching of the youth for allegedly stealing small amounts of rice and other food items is an example of the moral lapse that has occurred in the society. It brought shame to Malayalis who take pride that Kerala is a complete literate state. It is essential that the court should interfere and direct for remedial measures, the letter said.It also said many welfare measures are being implemented in tribal areas through various government agencies. Poverty alleviation programmes are being conducted in these regions with the help of other charitable organizations too. If Madhu had to steal food despite the existence of such initiatives, it shows that the welfare measures of the government arent effective. Changes should be made to the welfare schemes for the tribals until the benefits reach them, the judge exhorted in the letter.The lynching also shows how tribals are being viewed by others, the judge pointed out. According to a report, Madhu used to work before but had to leave the job due to fear of other co-workers. Steps are needed to ensure that such attacks against tribals are prevented, the judge demanded.Further, the judge said in the letter that the seriousness of the crime committed against Madhu is much higher if he was a person who was mentally unstable. The incident that saw a mob taking law into their hands should be viewed very seriously. Effective action is required to ensure that similar incidents do not repeat, including proper investigation and prosecution, the letter said."

Asking the staff to suggest South Indian cuisine, Murugan quickly settles for onion uttapam. I can never say no to onion uttapam; its my favourite, he says with a genial smile. Meanwhile, fresh watermelon juice is served providing a perfect start to our chat.With a collection of poems and short stories and now Poonachi , Murugan seems to have gotten over the controversy created over his book Madhorubhagan or One Part Woman . Referring to it, he observes, I do not hold any grudge or hard feelings. What I am very sorrowful about is that peoplewho did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me. It must have been hard giving up writing? No, on the contrary, I got enough time to spend with my family, grow potted plants and devote time to academics, says Murugan with the help of an interpretor.For Murugan, writing has been a second nature since he was eight. There was a childrens programme on Trichy radio station in which poems written by kids were read out. I used to regularly contribute for that. I wrote everyday because I am introvert, retiring and shy by nature. I did not talk a lot, and always avoided crowds. So, writing poems and stories substituted social interaction. Believe it or not, I managed to fill up 30 notebooks, he recalls.Writing short stories commenced from Class IX. I was inspired after reading graphic tales in magazines which I could not afford but my aunt used to buy. Gradually, my teachers came to know and encouraged me to participate in local school contests. Thus set in motion was Murugans life long passion for chiselling words.Pursuing Ph.D., Murugans first novel Eru Veyyil (The Rising Heat) was published in 1991 which he wrote during his summer vacations. I was 25 then and wrote it staying with my mother in a thatched hut with no electricity. My mother would be busy with the livestock while I lost sense of time adhering to my own clock. I used to only sleep, eat and write, never going out. This got her worried with many suggesting that I had lost my mind. So before returning to Chennai, she made me wear a holy thread blessed by a pujari around the waist. Every time I returned home I had to show it to her, he jests. As a child he loved sitting on a village boulder scribbling in his notebooks. My neighbours would tell me that one day I will get stuck to the boulder and would have to be surgically separated from it.Having lost his father early, Murugan was very close to his mother. I was called a mamas boy even after I got married. In a certain sense I narrate my mothers story through Poonachi. Like the goat, she too was the seventh child who lost her mother at birth; was a loner with her father being rarely at home. Their filial bond is so strong that even today Murugan has kept his mothers cell phone and SIM card as a memory.So is Murugan like his mother, a staunch believer of God? In my early years I was, visiting Kali and Murugan temples regularly. Later, studying Marxism and Periyars works, I started questioning, with the intensity of worship coming down. Those days, I argued with my mother on several occasions. Over the years reading more on these issues, I have come to the conclusion that whether God exists or not is not important but what is pertinent is whether He is necessary or not. For those He is, they must believe in Him without being criticised. Espousing live and let live, his belief sounds fair. Continuing, he adds, I do like to spend time at some of my favourite temples and tend to embrace the spiritual component of religion.The staff brings in sizzling onion uttapam with different chutneys, the coconut and its mint and tomato flavoured versions. Trying each of them, Murugan, gestures his appreciation. The uttapam is crisp and well made and the chutneys delicious. Not averse to trying local cuisine, the writer generally prefers South Indian dishes. I relish idlis, ragi dosa made with palm sugar, rice and paruppu kuzhambu; dishes made of country chicken but staying in Korea for a writers residency I had local preparation for a month without any fuss. Hailing from a rural region, Murugan has a weakness for vegetables. I love bitter gourd, suraikai (bottle gourd), lady finger, podalangai (snake gourd), brinjal and peerkangai (ridge gourd). The joke at home is whenever I am sent to buy vegetables these are bound to figure. Murugan does miss some preparations of his native place like kachayam, made of rice flour and jaggery and soiyang, a steamed pulse based dish kneaded with palm sugar. With passage of time, people have stopped making them.Calling himself a reasonable cook, Murugan reveals that like writing, he embraced cooking very early in life. With my parents leaving early to work on fields, my brother and I used to prepare and eat breakfast and walk five kilometres to school. We simply learnt by observing mother and helping her. He counts arisi paruppa, milagai (black pepper) and herbal rasams as his best preparation. The ridge gourd subzi I whip up, is relished by my wife so much that on returning home after holidays she always asks me to make it.Murugans felicity with cooking comes across in some of his works too. Yes, it does, but not deliberately, only on demand of the narrative. For example, in Arthanari and Aalavayan , sequels to the One Part Woman , I talk about how to grow and prepare a local variety of egg plant as mother used to. In Poonachi, I write about rice gruel and how to make dry salted meat pieces for future use. Likewise, in Seasons of the Palm there is description of ragi porridge.Drawing parallelsHaving learnt to wield the pen and cooking spud since childhood, Murugan says one can draw a lot of parallels between the two arts. For cooking and writing, passion, perseverance and persistence are must. Also to excel in their craft, the cook and writer must get out of their comfort zone and try something new. And eventually, both food and a work of literature must satisfy people.Reflecting on the making of a writer, Murugan states, The command over language and the content selection comes with experience. The foundation of good writing is the ability to get past ones own value system because that is what holds us from absorbing a lot of things. A good writer has to suspend his own value system and assimilate experiences. Did this come to him naturally? No, in many of my early works, for example, my short story collection, Thiruchengodu , I was heavily biased. Later I got over them and started writing on issues considered taboo by society. Examples of these are Pee Kadaigal (tales about shit) and Kethavarthe Pesarae (I speak bad words).Talking about keeping aside biases, Murugan is remarkable for etching characters which are neither black nor white. I avoid creating one dimensional characters. I believe all humans are a mix of both. In Poonachi, the old lady who is very caring to the goat becomes selfish when it comes to her survival. In her early years, her love is pure and selfless while later when she faces financial crunch, her kindness becomes conditional but that does not make her an villain. That is the way humans are, he remarks as we wind up our interaction.What I am very sorrowful about is that people who did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me"

A load-carrying hamali worker in Kuppam, he is the go-to man at Muniyappa tea stall for poor families who cannot afford clothes, books, shoes and stationery for students when the academic year arrives.Some people ask him for rice and provisions too, while others just want blessings on their childrens birthday. The hamalis charitable activity extends to payment of fees for students and even the passport application fee for youth seeking jobs abroad.The worker, who hails from Shantipuram mandal of Kuppam Assembly constituency, is not literate. He has been pursuing social service along with his wife and children since they moved to Kuppam two decades ago in search of livelihood. His life as a hamali worker began at the Kuppam bus station. Over time he became maistry (leader).The sight of two girls in tattered clothes loitering at the bus station two decades ago was the turning point for him. The childrens mother was dead and their alcohol-addicted father had deserted them.His first move was to get new clothes for them and send them to school, involving their relatives.No cash donationsHe put together essentials for migrant workers, needy families at Shikari colony and people abandoned at the bus station and elsewhere. During festivals, he arranges for distribution of new clothes. But, donations in cash are not accepted.He also got a donation of Rs. 50,000 from the Hamali Union and presented it to Kuppam MLA and Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to build Amaravati.Recently, the hamali got praise from police, when he collected blankets, clothes and rice bags for the Charity Wall area of the police at the District Hospital in Chittoor.Speaking to The Hindu , Lakshminarayana says that his wife, Rajeswari (50), a home-maker, and his 40 co-workers are a great strength to him. Charity has no season. Blankets which are shunned in summer would keep the roadside families warm in winter. There is nothing like a waste thing, he adds."

Over the years, Nestle has reduced salt in Maggi by 33%. The instant noodles brand, which has remained the mainstay of Nestles Indian portfolio, contributed around 35% to the companys growth in 2017.This change is happening not only in the packaged food business but also across categories such as cosmetics, said Arvind Singhal, founder of retail consultancy Technopak. There is a consumer backlash against products that are perceived to have higher content of sugar, salt and chemicals. There is a definite consumer shift towards products that have natural and Ayurvedic properties.And Nestle isnt the only food company that has been talking about tweaking products  to not only satiate palates of Indian consumers but also their newfound bias towards healthier products.Global food and beverage giants Coke and PepsiCo were some of the first companies to jump on to the health bandwagon. While PepsiCo has chalked out a strategy to shift its business away from colas to premium food products, Coke has pledged to reduce sugar content across its portfolio.Even junk food companies have been proactive. Recently, multinational fast food chain KFC chose rice bran oil over palm oil to fry its products in India. Similarly, Gunjan Shah, VP of sales at Britannia, said there is increased demand for fortified food. For instance, we have seen traction for bread that is fortified with vitamins."

Inbadurai, the crowd started swelling after 10 a.m. with the cadre being transported from various parts of the district in vans playing the hit numbers from MGR films.As no speaker at the protest venue could deliver riveting speech on the Cauvery issue and the need for forming CMB to save the delta farmers, the huge crowd occupying the seats started melting away after 12.30 p.m. They seemed to have grown tired with the regular blame game that put all the accusation on its arch rival Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam for the present state of affairs.The cadre, who were brought in vans from rural Tirunelveli to the venue even up to 11.45 a.m., started leaving for their villages around 2 p.m., much to the embarrassment of the organisers. While the small eatery near Lourdhunathan Statue that serves variety rice was overflowing with the women who were brought in the vans for the hunger strike, the TASMAC bar located on the other side of the protest venue too did brisk business.After having the sambar rice here, well leave for our villages, said K. Mariammal of Valliyoor while buying the lunch packet at the eatery around 2 p.m.When the protest came to an end around 5 p.m., more than 50% of the cadre had left the spot.In Nagercoil, Minister for Tamil Development K. Pandiarajan, who participated in the hunger strike, said the Centre had miserably failed to understand the sentiments of Tamils and it was trying to buy three more months from the Supreme Court citing the Assembly elections in Karnataka.

Development of bio-soils for encouraging natural water percolation and for ground water recharge which would also help in reducing urban flooding is another aspect pointed out.It calls for adoption of concentrated solar thermal in industrial heating, cooking and cooling applications, and adoption of waste-to-energy system on a wider scale to reduce fuel requirements in the process of heating.Similar energy-efficiency measures are also necessary in industrial clusters like rice mills, pharma and bulk drugs industry, the report stated.Changing climateIndia ranked as sixth most climate vulnerable country in world in terms of facing extreme weather events - Germanwatch Climate Risk Index 2018.

The shuttlecock is an object made out of cotton balls or filled with rice husks, symbolizing prosperity and happiness.Yogesh Bhalerao, director, MIT Academy of Engineering said at a news conference, ""The game consists of an open field with a 15m bamboo stick planted in the middle. A bamboo ring is hung on top of the stick. The ring is covered in yellow and pink papers. Yellow represents the moon, while pink represents the sun.""The shuttlecock is hung by a string sewn to its centre. It is decorated with colorful cotton representing the colours of the rainbow. While playing, the player holds the end of the string to swing it clockwise before throwing and aims for the centre of the ring. If the shuttlecock makes it through the ring, the player wins.

We have plugged the leakage of subsidised wheat, rice and coarse grains to the tune of Rs 17,500 crore annually. Though there is no direct savings because new beneficiaries also get added, now we are providing the foodgrains to the real beneficiaries, food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told TOI.According to government data, about 23.19 crore ration cards have been issued to people under the National Food Security Act ( NFSA ). While all the ration cards have been digitised, the progress of linking ration cards to Aadhaar numbers is about 82%. More bogus ration cards will be out of the system once we have 100% Aadhaar seeding, Paswan said.Data compiled by the food ministry show that nearly 50% of the deleted ration cards across the country came from Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal . A large number of bogus ration cards were also deleted in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.NFSA is the worlds largest welfare scheme, which targets ensuring food security to more than 80 crore eligible beneficiaries."

Better price for the fine quality of rice in open market and lethargic approach of TNCSC officials are attributed to the reason for poor procurement of paddy in Trichy district, farmers alleged.However, 62,000 tonnes of paddy has been procured in Nagapattinam and 75,000 tonnes from 520 DPCs against the target of 2 lakh tonnes in Thanjavur district. The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) opened 26 DPCs across Trichy district at various places to purchase samba paddy from the farmers raised from around 1.03 lakh acres. As per the new procurement price fixed by the state government, farmers would get Rs 1,660 including Rs 70 as increment for A grade variety and Rs 1,550 including Rs 50 as increment price for common variety. For both varieties, the allowable moisture is fixed as 17 per cent.The agriculture department had recommended to the farmers to use ADT  49, TKM 13, NLR, Co R 50 and Trichy 3 varieties which are pest-resistant. However, most of the farmers cultivate Andhra Ponni due to better price despite officials warning about false smut disease. Since even the private traders are ready to give Rs 1,780 to 1,810 per tonne, farmers prefer to sell their produce to them instead of DPCs, said N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of Bharathiya Kisan Sangam There are no activities at these DPCs and we could not find any staff there. If the situation is so, who would go there to sell their produce?  Veerasekaran asked.However, senior officials from TNCSC in Trichy denied the allegations. They said they had deputed the required staff at all the centres. Since they expect more arrivals from Lalgudi area, at present they were concentrating more on the 11 centres opened in that block."

How is being finance minister in the SAD-BJP coalition different from being one in the Congress government The difference between the Akali finance minister and the Congress finance minister is that the style of functioning of Capt Amarinder Singh is very different from Mr Parkash Singh Badal. Capt Singh likes to delegate his work, he trusts you completely and expects results. In Mr Badals case, he never delegated and he didnt expect results. He would take finance departments meetings personally and not invite the finance minister. In the present dispensation, I am expected to tie up everything, sew up everything and give a final presentation either to the CM or the cabinet. In that sense, its quite different.I think the last 10 years had been very reckless in so far as populism is concerned, in terms of good governance or administration. A lot of money was recklessly thrown on projects not in the larger interest of Punjab. For example, for the last 10 years they kept telling us that they had foodstock to cover all the losses. But one day before the counting of votes on March 10, 2017, the Punjab government signed an agreement with the Centre accepting all the losses and converting that account into a term loan. In one stroke of pen, we were saddled with $4.5 billion or Rs 31,000 crore. Similarly, electricity boards losses of about Rs 17,000 crore were converted to UDAY bonds. So about Rs 51,000 crore was loaded in within a few weeks.In the last financial year of the SAD government, they made memorials worth Rs 2,000 crore. But for the first time, there was a strike in the Panjab University for 20 days. Students were beaten up. PU was just asking for Rs 20 crore of additional government support. We have not paid the Sainik School at Kapurthala, which for continuous 17 years got the Presidents medal for sending most cadets to the NDA. The annual grant to the school was Rs 1 crore, which is peanuts. Baba Farid Health Sciences University vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur wanted Rs 50 crore to make it a world class university.Once they have been built, what do you do? Either you complete them or leave them. They are all half-constructed. So well have to complete them. But, why were these decisions taken?All revenue of Mandi Board accounts to the tune of about Rs 5,000 crore, PIDB about Rs 2,000 crore a year have been escrowed with the banks for five years. Before they left, they made sure that they emptied out everything and no sources of revenue were left for the next government. Its, as they call it in military, a scorched earth policy where the retreating forces destroy everything. But in this process, the Congress government has learnt a lesson, that howsoever reckless you are, you will be reduced to 15 seats, if you are not careful, if good governance is not there, and if corruption is there. The basic concern is rozi-roti and, what in Urdu they say, izzat ki roti.We were acutely aware of what was happening in Punjab. Whatever the Congress government has promised is basically with the view to kick-start the economy. Now in this cross-subsidisation of giving free power to farmers, the whole subsidy burden was loaded on to the industry of Punjab. They were getting power at Rs 7.60 a unit. If I can take you 50 years back: Why did Punjab progress? Punjab progressed because it had the Bhakra Dam. Because Punjab had access to cheap power, Punjab industrialised and developed.Industry was leaving Punjab in droves because of the power situation. So how do we retain them? We have to create a level-playing field. So when you talk about populism, I would respectfully disagree with you. It was not populism. It involves a subsidy of about Rs 1,500 crore. But I see benefits or multiplier effects if we can retain our industry. Because you dont just retain industry, you also retain jobs and taxes. So, this was a must.No, this is not the only way. There are two other things that need to be done. Farmers have to be weaned away from agriculture. If agriculture forms 20% of Punjabs GDP and 75% people are engaged in agriculture, that means 75% people are trying to earn Rs 20. They are not going to be rich or well-off. The idea is to give skill sets and job opportunities to farmers children so that they can get away and start doing other jobs. Second step is to give better crop prices and promote alternative crops. It has to be multi-pronged approach and debt has to be taken care of. Unless you do all three simultaneously, you will not have the desired effect.We have to remodel our economy from a foodgrainproducing economy into a more industrialised or a service-oriented one. That model has to be put in place in the next four years. If we dont do that, I foresee our resources will be severely affected in the post-GST situation when compensation stops after four years.The Green Revolution must move eastwards. Punjab should be relieved of this duty of growing foodgrains for the country. We have done this duty for 60 years, but in this process we have poisoned our soil, depleted our aquifers and water sources. Let Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa, which form the natural food bowl of India, do that duty.We are saying instead of rice, we will be very interested in growing maize. As long as we get the MSP or a little bit of hand-holding, Punjab could become Denmark of India. Why should there not be MSP on milk, fruits, or vegetables? If you study the food policy of India, it is rooted in the 1960s and Green Revolution was the main thrust at the time.If you look at an average Indian, he is malnourished. So now, the Union government should change the food policy to nutrition policy. An average man should have the access to fruit, milk and vegetables, and Punjab could step in as the producer of milk, fruits and vegetables. And, this is how we can remodel and maize could be one of the options.Of course, maize would give as much income or cash as rice would. There would be no problem of stubble burning as well. It will take care of all that.I think that is the political line. The Punjab government is basically trying to assess the electricity requirement. At present, any transmission losses or any inefficiencies of the electricity board are actually all being billed to free power. This is only a pilot project. We are trying to tell farmers that every tubewell costs us, say Rs 48,000 per year. We have 1.4 million pumps. So we are saying, you take this Rs 48,000 which we anyway have to give. In case, you can save power of say Rs 18,000 out of Rs 48,000 that we pay you, then Rs 18,000 is yours. There is another angle to it. We want to save water as well. If farmers accept it, we are going to go further and if not, let it remain a pilot project.We had flagged this issue with the Union finance and agriculture ministers. Maybe the CM will again meet Union minister (Ram Vilas) Paswan and we again will say, Either you take over the entire procurement operation, or reimburse us our actuals  whichever is convenient for you. Pre-GST, we have been charging some cess from the FCI, but it has been subsumed now.Food procurement exercise is inherently a lossmaking exercise to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore per year for Punjab. The Punjab government has to pay Rs 3,200 crore every year to the Centre for next 20 years. Over that, Rs 1,800 crore is the annual loss for procurement of grains. Why should we suffer a burden of Rs 5,000 crore every year? Why should we be burdened with this huge amount when we are undertaking the procurement exercise for the Centre, we are poisoning our soil and exhausting our ground water?I think we are actually selling water not the foodgrains. Every kilogram of rice takes 5,000 litres of water and every kilogram of wheat takes 3,000 litres. To get a cash credit limit, we have to first deposit that loss with the Central government before they give us the limit. We had paid Rs 1,100 crore before the wheat season.I quite agree with this. We have not been able to increase our revenue share and industry in our economy. We are dependent on the Centre. That is why I said, we need to remodel our economy.There are two huge areas I see for Punjab. One is our excise policy. States like Tamil Nadu and Kerala have opted for corporation model. We are not trying to go for retail mode, but trying to have wholesale part of it so that we can track every bottle that comes to the state either from our own distilleries or from outside. There is a technology to help curb sale of illegal or nontaxed liquor. My own feeling is that distillers, wholesalers and retailers are the same people. This is the area where Punjab should increase revenue by 25% every year. This year, my target is to generate Rs 1,000 crore in revenue and next year it could go up to Rs 2,000 crore.Second area where our revenue can be increased is mining. My feeling is if we can identify additional mines and if we can install technology to check illegal mining, this is an industry worth Rs 1,500-2,000 crore. We are now generating around Rs 150-200 crore from mining compared to around Rs 45 lakh during the Akali regime. Although we had auctioned around Rs 400 crores of sand mines, some people backed out and there was some controversy.Punjab should also be looking at non-tax revenue as it has the lowest non-tax revenue collection in India. The rates have not been revised for 20-30 years. We would ask all departments to review their non-tax revenue.We have flagged this issue with the RBI and even the Union finance minister that there has been some unethical lending to the farmers by commercial banks. This must be checked because in order to achieve their targets they indulge in such things where they know that this money can never be recovered. It is beyond our purview to bring these banks to kneel. We have made a big hue and cry. The reason why we started farm debt waiver first with cooperative banks was that we did not have data from commercial banks.We have already rolled out some of the bigger promises. There were two types of promises. Ones which did not entail any financial liability like electricity subsidy to industry, or farm debt waiver. So we have already rolled out all these. For smartphones we are in talks with many companies. There are some procedural and tax issues with those firms because it is a service and soon those would be resolved. I dont think smartphones will not be handed out as promised.Sometimes tokenism is also important. Mahatama Gandhi was not short of kurtas. He was a barrister from London. But he never wore kurtas because he realized that 70% of people in India at that time never wore a shirt. I think leaders should be role models. Even tokenism of doing away with red beacons on vehicles was a decision in the same direction.It is not only about PDS. They have not allowed use of ethanol made of foodgrains. They have banned it for rice and maize.At this moment, if I look at the total under the MSP regime what the farmers are being paid is about Rs 55,000 crore and the subsidy bill of power, which is the biggest subsidy, is around Rs 6,000 crore. It would add up to around 15% of the total compensation which is being paid to farmers. At this moment I feel that farmers are not able to take that 15%. That would be a huge blow.We will have to carry on with it till such time when we can have farms up and running. It is not possible at the moment. Basically, you have to prioritise, what needs to be done. In Punjab, human resource needs to be upgraded in a massive way.Manpreet Badal is not a first-time finance minister, he was the finance minister in the Akali government as well. Despite that he has not been able to generate resources and has been taking the shelter of empty coffers left by the SAD-BJP government. If he cannot implement the promises made in the election manifesto and cannot improve the financial condition of the state, it is better for him to give up the post. It is for the first time that the salaries of employees are being delayed. How will there be development in the state? At the same time, he has been making unrealistic promises of making Punjab revenue surplus in next four years.The Punjab finance minister has always been begging for financial support from the Union government when the state government has not even been able to distribute funds released by the Centre for various welfare schemes. One of the best examples is the post-matric scholarship for the Scheduled Caste students where around Rs 115 crore sent by the Centre has not been released by the state. Finance department sher-oshayari se nahi chalta. Jab Raja hi mast ho jayega to wazir se kya umeed ki ja sakti hai? Salaries are not being paid on time to employees, pensions are not being distributed for months, and farm debt waiver has not been properly implemented. What to talk about distribution of smartphones to youth as promised in the election manifesto?It seems to be a totally confused government. The Congress govt totally miscalculated Rs 15,000 crore revenue in its first budget. The finance dept doesnt seem to be in the loop of the decisions being taken by other departments. I had asked them during the last budget session where they would generate Rs 10,000 crore revenue from when they do not have any concrete roadmap. The state cannot borrow more than 3% of the GSDP. The Congress government has not been able to even implement announcements made in the last years budget. They have not even cleared the DA and arrears to employees till date and salaries are being delayed every month."

Sources said the yield of both cereals and pulses is likely to fall significantly, which may push up the prices of some commodities, especially wheat and gram.The agriculture department production data, which refers to the 2017 kharif season and the ongoing rabi season, includes estimates after the recent hailstorms in the state.A state agriculture department official told TOI that the fall in production of pulses like green gram, soybean and black gram was due to the dry spell during the monsoon last year, while paddy or rice suffered due to both the dry spell during last years kharif season as well as pest attacks. The rabi season too had its share of unseasonal rain, where crops growing on close to 2.5 lakh hectare suffered. However, only the coming period will reflect the actual yield from the rabi season, he said.Vilas Shinde, director of Sahyadri Farmer Producer Group , said variation in the weather was one of the reasons for the fall in production of the wheat during the rabi season. Wheat needs cold weather for about 40 days. However, the rainfall in December last year and the recent hail and unseasonal rain events adversely affected wheat production. Production of pulses fell because farmers reduced sowing last year after the low minimum support price offered to them in 2016, he said.Wheat production is estimated to dip from 22 lakh tonne to 12 lakh tonne this fiscal while that of gram may fall by 1 lakh tonne from 19 lakh tonne.Dhaval Shah, director, Jairaj Group , which deals in food commodities in western India, said price of wheat is expected to rise by Rs 2-3 per kg. He said the price of gram may also rise. Maharashtras wheat mostly comes from Madhya Pradesh, where recent unseasonal rain damaged the crop. Their government may also hike the MSP. Both these reasons may push up wheat prices further, he said."

But he has few other options.""There are floods during the rainy season. My hands get itchy and the harvest is damaged,"" the 54-year-old tells AFP.""Pollution makes my rice hollow. If I keep going I'll lose money, but if I don't, I'll have no other job,"" he adds.Now faced with a health emergency after decades of failed clean-up efforts, Jakarta is stepping in with a seemingly impossible goal: make the Citarum's water drinkable by 2025.Using this polluted water is a risky calculation for many of the 30 million people who rely on it for irrigation, washing and even drinking water -- including around 80 percent of residents in the sprawling capital Jakarta.At nearly 300-kilometres long, the river is also a key source for hydroelectric power for Indonesia 's most populated island Java and tourism hotspot Bali.The World Bank declared it the most-polluted river in the world a decade ago, an description widely picked up by media and environmentalists.Waste levels can vary depending on how pollution is measured and the time of the year.But the Citarum is dangerous by almost any standard.Previous research has shown it has alarming levels of toxic chemicals -- including 1,000 times more lead than the US standard for safe drinking water.It regularly appears on most-polluted lists alongside India's Ganges river, the Mississippi river in the United States and China's Yellow river.In January, Jakarta yanked responsibility away from local government, and vowed to get tough on business owners who ignore waste-disposal rules.Factories that fall short could have operating permits revoked.And CCTV cameras are to be installed along the river's banks to keep an eye out for offenders dumping waste in the early morning hours to evade detection.Meanwhile, dredging equipment will be used to clean up the filthy river, said Djoko Hartoyo, a spokesman for the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.""We are not playing around this time,"" he added.""We're going in with a holistic approach so we are optimistic we can make Citarum clean again, just like it was 50 or 60 years ago.""In the 1980s, a new industrial zone sprang up around the small town of Majalaya, about 170 kilometres east of Jakarta, and things quickly changed for the pristine river.Some 2,000 area textile factories have provided much-needed jobs, but it came with a heavy cost: about 280 tons of industrial waste are dumped into the river each day, according to government and environmental group data.Making matters worse, many locals think nothing of tossing their household waste into its toxic waters.""When it rains and my house gets flooded, the smell is awful,"" Achmad Fachrureza said from inside an inflatable dingy, as he navigated the river's styrofoam containers, fabric, empty cans, plastic bottles and garbage bags.The 57-year-old villager said he was sacked from his job as a textile factory security guard after asking questions about the firm's waste disposal system.Factory pipes dump waste directly into waters bubbling with chemical dyes used in textiles, creating an overwhelming stench.""Most factories here have a waste disposal system, but they don't work properly because it's just a formality,"" said Deni Riswandani from local environmental group Elingan.That poses a serious health risk, especially for the five million people living in the river's basin.Many locals suffer from skin diseases like scabies and dermatitis, as well as respiratory infections from inhaling factory pollution.""The number of people going to the health clinic is very high,"" Riswandani said.""We keep reporting these issues to the government, but we never get a solution.""He and other frustrated activists have blocked some waste pipes with rocks and concrete, but the factories usually remove the blockage right away.Locals hope Jakarta's new goals can be achieved. But they're also sceptical given the scale of the task and endemic corruption that could see factory owners try to buy their way out of trouble.""I long to see the Citarum like it was when I was young"", Fachrureza said.""I could swim in it and drink the water. It was so clean."""

Chants of Amme narayana Devi narayana Lekshmi narayana Bhadre narayana resounded in the air as the largest congregation of women in the world cooked Pongala payasam for the goddess.The Pongala marks the 10th day of the annual festival of the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple. The devotees performed the ritual by lighting their makeshift brick stoves from the flame passed from the pandara aduppu set in front of temple, and the entire city turned cloudy with the fumes from the hearths.The Pongala payasam is made of rice cooked in jaggery with ghee and a handful of coconut, garnished with raisins and cashewnuts. One could also get the heady aroma of manda puttu  steamed balls made of rice powder and green dal powder blended with coconut and jiggery  and theralli, a mixture of rice powder and jaggery steamed in aromatic vayana leaves.The ritual was observed by several lakhs of devotees spread across the length and breadth of the city but was most concentrated within a radius of three kilometres of the Attukal Temple.Among the first-timers we spotted Olympian and veteran sportsperson, P T Usha, who conducted the ritual inside the temple premises. It is a dream come true for me. I had been wanting to offer Pongala for long but couldnt do so owing to several difficulties. I reached Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday evening and performed Pongala with my family including my sisters and their daughters. Im glad I could do it inside the temple premises itself and I thank the temple authorities for that, says Usha.Another debutant was transgender poet and activist Vijayaraja Mallika . She performed the Pongala at Pettah with Renju Rejimar, celebrity make-up artiste, and transgender activists Soorya, Sreemayi, Seema, Karthika and Kavya. I am very excited about the Pongala but am not sure of how to perform it. My friend Renju Rejimar has been performing it for the past three years and is helping me. I offer Pongala to seek blessings of Attukal Amma to make my relationship turn into a marriage and for our community to prosper, says Vijayaraja Mallika. Renju shares her views, and commented that the Pongala is an offering to appease the goddess. I wish to become a mother. I have prayed to Attukal Amma to bless me with my own baby. I am on the look-out for hospitals which will help me become a mother. I want to experience the pain of childbirth, adds Renju.Among the usual faces were actresses Chippy, Krishna Prabha, Jalaja, TT Usha and singer Rajalekshmi. The women performed the Pongala near to the temple. I am performing the ritual near the temple this time. I feel blessed to offer it near the Devis sannidhi. I pray that she blesses my family and also others with good health and prosperity throughout the year, says Jalaja.Meanwhile, the inmates of the Women Prison and Correctional Home Thiruvananthapuram at Attukulangara also performed the Pongala for the seventh consecutive year, says jail superintendant OV Valli. This year, four inmates are performing the Pongala, representing the 60 in our jail. The jail officials are also offering Pongala this year.Pongala nivedyam was held at 2.30 pm. With the kuruthi tharpanam on Saturday, the annual fete will come to a conclusion."

""They will be released on station bail soon,"" said an official in the task force.Acting on a tip-off, police conducted vehicle checks at Anjaneyapuram forest check post near Tirupati on Thursday night and stopped a truck for inspection. The truck's cargo area was covered with tarpaulin, and it appeared that the truck was carrying goods. But, on inspection, it was found that 84 men were travelling on the truck, under the cover of tarpaulin. The task force reportedly seized axes, sickles and rice bags from them. Police also seized the truck.Since they had not committed any crime and were only on their way to the forest, the task force booked cases against them for planning to fell and smuggle trees.Of the 84 men, 21 men are from Palayapalam village in Pungapattu Nadu panchayat in Jawadhu hills that falls in Tirupattur Taluk of Vellore district. ""The men have been lured into red sanders smuggling by K Ravi, an agent from Palayapalam,"" said a retired government employee in the hill. He added that the state government and police had failed miserably in creating livelihood for the tribals and preventing the timber mafia from exploiting poverty of the men in the hills.Police said they had decided to let the men go since they were arrested outside forest area and there was no evidence to link them to red sanders smuggling.Graduates and college students were among the men on the truck. Youth as young as 19 and 20 years have been lured into red sanders smuggling with the promise of hefty payment. In a footage shared by the Andhra Pradesh police, a postgraduate student of the Government College in Tiruvannamalai, who was among the 84 men on the truck, is heard saying, ""I was promised good money. But I was not aware that we were hired for illegal activities."""

Several districts which were earlier neglected by businesspersons are seeing an inflow of investment due to assurance on the power front. It has also markedly changed the lifestyle of residents, with thousands of people purchasing air-conditioners.A recent study by discoms showed a rise in domestic and industrial power consumption as several industrialists are setting up small and medium units in rural areas. This is particularly visible in most backward districts such as Adilabad, Asifabad, Mahabubabad, Mahbubnagar and Kothagudem, where the land prices are cheap. Availability of cheap labour is an added attraction that is pulling in fresh investments.Sources in the industries department said that they are overwhelmed with the response from industrialists for setting up new units in most backward districts. We received more than 4,000 new enquiries for fresh investments in rural Telangana , which is unprecedented, said sources.Self-employment units also coming up in the villages with the availability of power. Youth who have some technical skill and a diploma are looking to open their own ventures in the villages. Rice mills, granite polishing, pumps and motors repair, floor mills, welding units and service centres are coming up with the introduction of 24-hour power supply, said a senior official of energy department.Across the country, only Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Telangana supply 24-hour power to rural areas. Rural households in nine out of 28 states  Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Mizoram, Sikkim and Uttar Pradesh  receive less than 18 hours of power a day.Till recently, urban areas, particularly cities such as Karimnagar, Warangal, Nizamabad and Khammam were attracting new industries due to availability of power and other infrastructure. But as the expenditure of setting up business increased in the urban areas, industrialists have started looking at backward districts."

Several concerns have been raised on introducing E-pos machines in ration shops but there is no going back in the decision to implement this.By April, all ration shops across the state will have electronic point of sale (E-pos) machines for distribution of items to customers.Following the success of the pilot run launched at 60 shops at Karunagapally , the government has started installing the machines at all shops and it is expected to be complete by March 31.

Raising native breeds of cattle remains his major avocation, but he is also into cultivating and promoting traditional rice varieties as well as vegetables and fruits, all the organic way.Sivas fascination for cattle began around 10 years ago when he bought bulls for ploughing his field and to provide manure for his farm. That was when the 59-year-old seriously thought about turning towards breeding. My intention was to raise pure native breeds that would be disease-resistant and yield milk as much as the hybrid ones, says the progressive farmer hailing from Musiri. He has been raising these rare indigenous breeds under a coconut grove. Besides Gir, he has Sahiwal, Congrat, the local Kangayam breed as well as a few Tellichery goats in the farm. He avidly goes around propagating his finding that Indian breeds give high yield of milk as they have excellent immunity.Siva accepts that hybrid varieties of cows yield higher quantities of milk than native breeds, but he points out that they are more suitable for commercial purpose. Their milk is not good for our health, he adds Agriculture is our ancestral occupation and we have been keeping cattle for a long time. The easiest way to identify a desi breed is by the hump, says Siva. According to him, humped cattle produced rich milk which contributed to brain function and growth.If cattle remains his first love, cultivating traditional varieties of rice and vegetables is his focus. Rice varieties like Mappillai Samba, thur Kitchadi Samba and Seeraga Samba are grown on his land in Murisi organically. The fodder, culled from the fields around him, does not have pesticide and, unlike commercial establishments, he claims he does not inject his cows with oxytocin injections to induce lactation. However, securing high-quality semen samples for breeding has been posing a challenge. Siva currently gets his frozen samples from farmers living in surrounding districts like Namakkal and Erode.Ask him where he drew his inspiration from and he points to Nammalvar, the green crusader, agricultural scientist and organic farming expert. It was he who spurred Subramania Siva to switch from ordinary farming to the organic way. Earlier, he has been cultivating whatever was prescribed by the agriculture department without asking questions. After his visit to my home, I totally changed. That day I decided to live a life without affecting our environment. Since then, for the last 10 years, I have been undertaking organic farming for the sake of the general public as well as for my cattle, he added.Siva has also been growing various types of native fruits like guava, papaya and vegetables without using any chemical or pesticide. He appealed to traders selling organic products to fix a minimum margin so that more people could afford them. He points out that if sales increased, the ultimate beneficiary would be the farmer. It is time we protected the hardier native breeds from extinction. Besides, we should hand over native breeds and chemical-free food to our future generation just as we got them from our ancestors. That is my wish, he added."

We cook about 35 kg of rice every day. We also need about 12 kg of onion and tomato, 3 kg of other vegetables; this we usually get through contributions. A small food company here gives the 300 rotis. Each meal costs us Rs22, he explains.Sometimes, demand overshoots supply, and they have to replenish before heading for Kidwai, but its all taken care of.Ahmed, who co-founded the initiative, saysis a hospital hub. Patients come from various parts of the state and country for treatment and they stay on. While the government provides free food for patients, their caretakers have to fend for themselves. Not everybody can afford to eat out three meals. This is why we want to help, he explains.Luckily for them, theres plenty of help available. Their initiative has inspired others to open their hearts too. Ansar Khan, also a volunteer, tells how. I buy the vegetables from a shop in Madiwala. One day, the woman from whom I buy in bulk got curious and asked me why I needed so much every day and I explained to her our work. From then on, she has refused to take money for the vegetables, says Khan.Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have benefited from the teams dedicated efforts already.Anjanappa Nayka, whose son is being treated at Jayadeva Hospital, has come to the city from Raichur. I came here seven days ago. It is really hard to afford the food here; it is three times more expensive. A person at the hospital told me about the free food in the afternoon. It has been a relief; there are others like me too who have benefited from this, he said.The initiative is such a hit now that Ayub Ahmed has started it in Mysuru at. And team has also finalised the plan to start this in Tumakuru."

Jointly addressing the newspersons here on Friday, AAP-backed Rajya Sabha member Sushil Gupta and Haryana unit head Navin Jaihind said this while elaborating on the partys plans for March 25 rally in Hisar and thereafter the general and assembly elections next year.We have the Delhi model of education and public health to offer when it comes to governance. Now students from reputed schools have started taking admission in the government schools in Delhi due to raised standards of education. Similarly, you can see that the national government too has picked up our model of mohalla clinics, said Gupta.However, Gupta avoided queries related to reactions of AAP leaders in Punjab in the wake of apology tendered by Kejriwal to Akali leader Bikram Majithia for linking him to drug trade in Punjab. Responding to same question, Jaihind said, Kejriwal has to concentrate on governance in the state. Secondly, there is nothing wrong in tendering an apology.Haryana unit of AAP on Friday said the party workers would hand over a chargesheet highlighting the corruption and wrongdoings of Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government to its convener Arvind Kejriwal during his Hisar rally on March 25.They said party workers were finalizing the contents of chargesheet which would include corruption at all levels across the state.Referring to the Hisar rally, Gupta said it would be a landmark event and bigger than those organized by the Congress, BJP and INLD held in Hodal, Jind and New Delhi, respectively.Unlike petrol rally and other rallies organized by CBI ( Congress BJP and INLD), our workers will reach there on their own. We cannot offer petrol, money and other things, hence we are distributing yellow rice as an invite. So far as the party is concerned, AAP has emerged as the only alternative in the state, said Jaihind. Gupta also said that AAP was the only option for the people now."

SingaravelouT_SingaravelouLieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Tuesday said the condition of women and families was far better in Puducherry than in other States because of the efforts of the Family Counselling Centres (FCCs) and anganwadi system.We need to build on this system and add more strength by interlinking women beat officers, SHGs and NGOs to the network and make it as an ideal model for all Union Territories and States in the country, she said, inaugurating a two-day orientation training programme for counsellors and FCCs.Puducherry would become more safe if all these agencies worked jointly, she said.K modelLauding Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy, Ms. Bedi said in jest that the coming together of the five can be dubbed as the K Model or the Kandasamy model since he was holding the departments of Welfare and Labour. Skill development of women would be of help and assistance could be provided through the Mudra scheme to support micro enterprises.Children who dropped out of schools could be taken care of and no family should feel neglected. The intervention of the five agencies would be of great assistance to the families. Women would also be linked to Lok Adalat for mediation on case-to-case basis, she said, adding that this would be done so that no woman felt alone anywhere.Praising Ms. Bedi for her intention to effect reforms in the Central Prison in Puducherry, Mr. Kandasamy pointed out that his appreciation of the Lt. Governor might give a different impression altogether to the audience. It is my right to quarrel with Ms. Bedi and at the same time I would appreciate her which is also my right, he said. He endorsed the Lt. Governors view that all welfare schemes, including the free rice scheme, reached the poor.Mr. Kandasamy recalled how the previous AINRC government had adopted different yardsticks for extending educational assistance to the students. He was of the view that the affluent need not be given assistance.But these schemes introduced by the previous regime had come to stay and it would be difficult to modify, he said. He appealed to the rich, the MLAs and the Ministers to come forward and detach themselves from the schemes meant for the poor.The Minister said the ordinance providing death penalty for rape of girls below 12 years was a step in the right direction."

Occasionally, they get requests for donkeys milk, which is in demand for its nutritional values."
