He also used these issues to criticise the Congress.Amid a cheering crowd, Mr. Modi began his address by hailing the rich Dasa and Sharana traditions of the land that advocated the coexistence of communities and blamed Congress for learning nothing from them.Had it [Congress] learned a lesson from the great traditions, it wouldnt have committed the sin of dividing people along caste lines, he said.Pointing at the prevailing water crisis at the tail-end of Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal that irrigates around 6 lakh acres in Raichur, Mr. Modi blamed the Congress for turning a deaf ear to the farmers water woes.The region is known as a rice bowl for its large-scale cultivation of Sona Masuri paddy. Farmers suffer from a lack of water for irrigation every year. Despite having the Krishna and the Tungabhadra, the farmers struggle to get a drop of water. However, the Congress government never thought of addressing the water crisis. It had promised to remove silt from the Tungabhadra reservoir. But, it forgot this after assuming power, he said.Citing BJP-led Maharashtra government as a role model in removing silt from tanks and reservoirs, Mr. Modi said that the BJP government, if it assumed power in the State, would launch a campaign of dredging rural tanks and reservoirs so as to make them hold more water for irrigation so that farmers would not face scarcity.Power crisisTriggering the sentiment of Raichur people in terms of power generation, the PM held the State government responsible for keeping the district in the dark. Raichur generates most of the energy that the State consumes. The main current switch of Karnataka is in Raichur. Yet, it lives in darkness. The sleeping government and sleeping Chief Minister never bothered about this, he said.Pointing at the Congress refusal in the Rajya Sabha for according constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes, the Prime Minister termed the Congress anti-Other Backward Classes.Backward Classes have been fighting for their constitutionally guaranteed rights for a long time now. The Congress did nothing to address their issues. Now, when we went to accord constitutional status to OBC commission, it ensured that it wouldnt happen by voting against it in Rajya Sabha, he said. Referring to recent Parliament disruptions, Mr. Modi said that Congress was stunned by the developmental initiatives of his government and attempted to disrupt Parliament proceedings just to blur his governments image.Blaming Congress for having no agenda except viciously attacking Modi, the PM said that the reason behind Congress rage against him was that he had put a mechanism in place that prevented it from continuing their plunder and misappropriation of funds in the implementation of welfare schemes such as Public Distribution System.He claimed that his government had stopped as much as Rs. 80,000 crore leakage annually in the implementation of various welfare schemes.Mr. Modi criticised Congress for keeping aside M.S. Swaminathan Commission report that recommended for at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production as Minimum Support Price.The Swaminathan report was gathering dust in Sonia sisters government and we are now implementing it, he said."

Durgarao (62), lured her by offering 15 kg rice every month from a pastor at Pulagurtha village.

Purchase centres were opened early in the district on March 26. Paddy arrivals began on April 7. However, at present, arrivals have become unmanageable as farmers are cutting the crop with the help of harvesters day and night and dumping produce as it is without cleaning at purchase centres. As a result, pressure on the centres has abnormally increased.According to Joint Collector A. Ravinder Reddy, given the arrivals it seems the target of 3 lakh tonnes would exceed this year as, till date, 1.95 lakh tonnes had already been shifted. Last year, since traders from Karnataka bought the fine variety (sannalu) Ganga Kaveri crop at higher rate, the pressure on purchase centres was low, he said. This year they have not come as they have a plenty of crop in their State resulting in unexpected high amount of stress on our purchase centres. Unloading at mills is yet another issue. Hardly 25 trucks are being emptied in a day, said the JC.Contradicting reports of delayed payments, authorities said that bill payments were being made within 24 hours. Till now, an amount of Rs. 80 crore has been cleared, they said."

Satyanarayana before the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal.The witness for AP, however, admitted before the tribunal hearing the case to decide the shares of AP and Telangana in Krishna water that modernisation of canals under Nagarjunsagar project as also others in the Krishna basin would bring down water requirement for cultivation of paddy considerably.Admitting that modernisation of NSRC, particularly lining of the canal, would improve its water conveyance efficiency considerably Mr. Satyanarayana told the tribunal that gross water requirement would, however, remain high due to more analytical estimation of potential evapo-transpiration (PET), the process of transfer of water to the atmosphere from the soil through evaporation and from plants through transpiration.Mr. Satyanarayana sought to verify the PET values when the Telangana's counsel pointed out that the agro-climatic atlas of AP had mentioned the PET values for Guntur ranging from 4.9 to 3.05 from July to December as against higher PET values of 5.6 to 4.1 cited in his affidavit. As asked by the counsel, the witness agreed to furnish humidity and wind speed figures for various districts in Krishna basin to the tribunal.Cross-examination of Mr. Satyanarayana, an agriculture scientist and Director of AP Rice Research Institute, by senior counsel for Telangana C.S. Vaidyanathan resumed before the tribunal in New Delhi on Monday with focus on crop water requirement. The witness was probed at length by the counsel on the gross and net irrigation requirement for paddy in different areas of Krishna basin in AP.The AP witness denied the suggestion of Telangana counsel when the latter put it that the former had furnished data and information related to crop water requirement in Krishna delta was inflated and unrelated to the actual water requirement.When pointed out that AP had computed gross water requirement for kharif paddy under Nagarjunsagar Right Canal (NSRC) at 3.9 ft, the depth of water flow at canal head, as per Krishna-Godavari Commission report while he (witness) had put at much higher at 4.58 ft in his affidavit, Mr. Satyanarayana explained that his estimation arrived with the help of modern methods was more realistic.Modernisation of NSRC, particularly lining of the canal, would improve water conveyance efficiency considerably.P.V.

In the stillness of night, particularly in the months of Panguni, Chithirai and Vaikasi, the songs hailing these deities will fill the air, riding on the string and the drum of the bow-like musical instrument.The folk art form, confined mostly to the southern districts of Tamil Nadu, has suddenly received global attention after Singapore-based rapper Lady Kash dedicated a song titled Villupaattu in honour of Poongani Ammal, an 82-year-old artiste from Kanniyakumari. It was also tweeted by Minister for Tamil MaFoi K. Pandiarajan.While the album sheds light on the traditional folk art and its performer, it does not capture the darker side of her real life. Poongani Ammal is living in abject penury, with hardly any source of income but for a paltry pension.I live on my old-age pension of Rs. 1,000, out of which Rs. 300 goes towards rent. The free rice distributed through the public distribution system and the remaining Rs. 700 keep me going, said Ms. Ammal, one of the oldest performers of the art.She is a native of Saravanan Theri near Agastheeswaram, but now lives in a rented single-room house in Kottaram. Her efforts to secure pension for old artistes have also been in vain. Ms. Ammal stopped performing nearly 15 years ago due to her advanced age. She was, however, invited to perform at the University of Madras two years ago. A widow whose husband passed away three years ago, she has been running from pillar to post seeking assistance from the government.I have made representations to MPs and MLAs, but to no avail, said Ms. Ammal, who learnt the art from Sivalingam Vathiyar, an yesteryear villupattu artiste. The inspiration came from the twin sisters  Lakshmi and Dhanalakshmi  who were then the most sought-after villupattu artistes.Husband and wife duoMs. Ammal was the main singer of the troupe while her husband Thangapandian played the kudam , a ghatam -like claypot instrument. Music will be produced by hitting the mouth of the pot with pad, made of the outer cover of the areca palm flower. Since the main instrument resembles a bow, the art form earned the name villupaatu. The main singer uses veesukol, comprising two sticks, and beats the bowstring as he/she sings.Folklorist A.K. Perumal said there were over 250 stories meant for villupaatu but only 70 were being used today. Literary works like Mookoodal Pallu and Virali Vidu Thoothu have references to villupaatu.There were many great performers of the art including Sundapatrivilai Saraswathi, Thovalai Sundaram Pilli, Punnarkulam Kolappa Pillai, Kadukkarai U. Thangappan, Kazhugumalai Velavan and Sangeetha and Vilathikulam Muthlakshmi, he added."

So when he died in his home town Mariani on Thursday, there werent enough people to carry his body to the crematorium.Mariani, in Assams Jorhat district, is about 320 km east of Guwahati.Local Congress MLA Rupjyoti Kurmi, 40, stepped in to be one of the pallbearers, as well as to cremate Mr. Deys body.He was too poor and lonely to have a decent funeral. As a human being and responsible for the people I represent, it was the least I could do for him, Mr. Kurmi told The Hindu .Mr. Dey, who was in his mid-50s, lived in the Deberapar Chariali locality of Mariani. Rupom Gogoi, a trader in the neighbourhood, came to know about his death and informed Mr. Kurmi.He lost no time in helping prepare the chita (stretcher-like bamboo structure on which a body is taken to the crematorium) and in carrying the body for cremation, Mr. Gogoi said.Local residents said that Mr. Kurmi, a three-time MLA from the Mariani constituency in Jorhat, has often provided humanitarian service  at times in situations considered too dangerous for VIPs.In July 2017, he hoisted a 50 kg bag of rice on his back and delivered it to a flood relief camp near the Kaziranga National Park.On Friday evening, less than 24 hours after ensuring Mr. Deys cremation, the MLA was a pall-bearer for the funeral of a local autorickshaw drivers mother. Kabir Ahmed, the driver, had wanted the MLA to be part of his mothers final journey.Mothers footstepsMr. Kurmi won his first Assembly election from Mariani in 2006. The seat had earlier been won by his mother Rupam Kurmi, the first woman graduate among Adivasis in Assam.Adivasis are often called tea tribes, though they dont enjoy the Scheduled Tribe status."

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao described the programme a result of out-of-the-box thinking which was never attempted by the previous regimes.In tune with his oft quoted words to reorient ourselves in the context of Telangana, Mr. Rao devised several programmes that also did not find any place in the manifesto. No doubt the investment support to agriculture topped the list as a high budget programme, but there were also life insurance for farmers, 24-hour power supply, Mission Kakatiya, assistance to brides under Kalyana Laxmi and Shaadi Mubaarak, distribution of sheep, KCR Kits to lactating mothers, supply of fine rice to hostels and expansion of overseas scholarships to students that won considerable appreciation.The Mission Kakatiya to desilt irrigation tanks with a view to increase their storage capacity was a hit in villages and so was Kalyana Laxmi and Shaadi Mubaarak where brides, in the beginning, got Rs. 50,000, but the amount was scaled up to Rs. 75,116 which is now Rs. 1,00,116. As part of sheep distribution scheme, units of sheep (20 female and one male) were given to shepherds.On the irrigation front, the government promised creation of irrigation potential for one crore acres which is in the process of execution with work on Kaleswaram, Palamuru-Ranga Reddy, Dindi and other lift irrigation projects being under way. The government has also set up a finance corporation for most backward classes and supply of fish at 100% subsidy which were not mentioned in the manifesto. The TRS government denies that it has failed to implement the promise of free education from KG to PG as 500-odd residential schools for SCs, STs, BCs and minorities that it had started have taken care of the programme in a different way. It also denies backtracking on three acre land to SCs saying the programme could not make a headway due to non-availability of land.As regards creation of employment by taking steps to repatriate 83,000 employees to Andhra Pradesh, the government maintained that there was neither delay nor lapse on its part as it took over one year to identify the vacancies and constitute the State Public Service Commission. The recruitment was taken up in all sincerity, it maintains."

However, agriculture generates less than a quarter of our Gross State Domestic Product.Talking about impulsive growth, Gupta pointed out, Agriculture sector in the state grew at 5.6% during 2005-06 to 2014-15 compared to the national average of 3.6%. However, this growth has been volatile due to recurring floods and droughts, variability in rainfall and various other factors. As of now, most of the government incentives favour staples such as rice and wheat for diversification. These need to be extended to fruits and vegetables as well.He said, The third agriculture road map of Bihar has envisaged an organic corridor along the Ganges. For this, we need to introduce market incentives, improve infrastructure, design price support and certification of organic produce to encourage farmers to switch to organic cultivation.TCI founding director Prof Prabhi Pingali and states agriculture production commissioner Sunil Kumar Singh talked about Food System Perspective on Agri-Nutrition.Research for Indian Nutrition and Agriculture director Nikhil Raj, International Food Policy Research Institute director (South Asia) P K Joshi, Bihar Beej Nigam MD Himanshu Kumar and Integrated Child Development Services former director Praveen Kishore presented their papers in the first session which focused on Diversifying Food in Bihar: Overcoming the Constraints.While the second session was on Animal Husbandry in Bihar, the third and fourth sessions were on Increasing Farmers Income through Improved Agriculture Markets and Value Chains in Bihar and Summing up and the Road Ahead, respectively."

The first film shot in Gobichettipalayam was Bhaagapirivinai in 1959. The film was produced by G N Velumani, a native of Gobichettipalayam. Many scenes of the film was shot in Gobichettipalayam, said Kallepatti Jyothy, producer cum location consultant. Talking to TOI, he said after Bhaagapirivinai, Ithu Sathiyam (1963), Kannadi Maaligai (1962), Soaappu Seeppu Kannadi (1968), Annakkili (1976) and Disai Mariya Paravaigal (1979) were taken in Gobichettipalayam.According to Jyothy, the lone location consultant in Erode district since 1980, at least 18 cinema shootings were taking place across Gobichettipalayam and its surrounding villages in a day in those days.Gobichettipalayam is surrounded by Western Ghats, which form the border of the region. River Bhavani traverses across the region. The temperature is moderately warm in Gobichettipalayam. Similarly, rainfall is also moderate and during monsoon season it may go high, unpredictable and unevenly distributed. Gobichettipalayam is not so windy. But, the abundance of trees and vegetation surrounding the town makes its climate pleasant always. The surrounding water logged rice fields contribute to the high humidity levels all the times. These are the reasons why cinema people prefer Gobichettipalayam for film shootings, Jyothy said. Gobichettipalayam is also has plenty of scenic places such as Bhavanisagar dam, Bannari temple, Gunderipallam, Vellode birds sanctuary, Kodiveri dam, paddy fields, Sathyamangalam forest and temples.Vellangkoil near Gobichettipalayam is the native place of film director and actor K Bhagyaraj, who had shot almost all of his movies in Gobichettipalayam and its surrounding areas.Like Bhagyaraj, directors S A Chandrasekar, Manivannan, R Sundarrajan, Liyakath Alikhan, P Vasu, Kasthuri Raja, T P Gajendran, Manojkumar, V Shekar, Manivasagam, K S Ravikumar, Dasari Narayanan, Koti Ramakrishna, Sundar C, Ramarajan and Mishkin had shot their films in Gobichettipalayam taluk.The last film in Gobichettipalayam was shot by Sundar C.

Unconditional love, an ability to accept uncertainties, and the strength to forget  and forgive, maybe  all that life never made easy.Seventy-three-year-old Minakshi Chattopadhyay has all of that, and much, much more. As the wife of poet Shakti Chattopadhyay, whom she had met in 1965 and married two years later and lived with him till his death in 1995, she has seen and borne it all  the madness and indiscipline of a genius poet, but also the warmth and easy companionship of a husband who she misses every day, even now.When they met in the heady mid-Sixties, Minakshi and Shakti were part of a group for whom evenings meant songs and adda. He was the one to introduce me to so many obscure places in Kolkata, she recalls. I never knew Victoria Memorial had such a good museum inside. He took me to the cemetery of Achi Saheb in Budge Budge. He also gave me a statue of Jesus during our trip to Kumartuli, she reminisces, about their courtship.She was as surprised as everyone else when Shakti announced to the entire world that he would marry her on August 15, 1967. He hadnt talked to me about it. When I confronted him in front of the Gwalior monument at Babughat, he just said it seemed fine, since it was a holiday. When I asked him, What if I dont agree?, pat came the reply: Ganga-e thele phele debo! (Ill push you to the Ganges).Back then, Shakti didnt have a permanent job. They had a ten-and-a-half-year age difference, and his unkempt appearance wouldnt make him a handsome groom. But the bohemian Shakti won, and the couple registered their marriage on August 15.One day, soon after marriage, Shakti stepped out of home, telling Minakshi he was going to buy cigarettes. On the way, he met a friend who was driving to Bhutan. The next thing Minakshi knew, Shakti had hitched a ride to Bhutan. I would initially worry, she says. But his mother was quite relaxed. Indiscipline, I soon realised, was in his blood.Shakti, she says, once announced that he and his friend Samir Sengupta would open a bookshop. Minakshi had quit teaching at South Point school at that time. The plan sounded fine, but for one glitch: Shakti had neither the money nor the space to run a bookshop. He would get Rs 20 for a poem, but he believed he would be able to convince the owner of a studio near Purna cinema to vacate his premises and make room for the bookshop, she says.The idea was highly implausible. Why would a man suddenly give up his studio at the request of someone he didnt even know? But Shakti believed otherwise. One day, he actually went to convince the studio owner. Minakshi stood at a distance, watching Shakti and Samir argue their case. Obviously, the studio owner didnt relent. But that day Minakshi understood that marrying a dreamer would mean more such incidents.It didnt take long for Shaktis outward flamboyance, clubbed with the inner calm of his enduringly mysterious monologues, to turn him into an icon. But that didnt curb his restlessness. Once, a kabuliwalah landed up at their home, since Shakti wanted to start a pistachio and nuts business! On another day, along with author Subhas Mukhopadhyay, he went angling. He promised to come home with fish that I should cook for lunch. While waiting for him, I cooked rice and egg curry. In the afternoon, he returned empty-handed and asked me what was for lunch. When I reminded him of his promise of getting fish, I was told that they had luckily escaped arrest because they had landed up fishing in a prohibited zone, she says.Yet, Minakshi never accuses Shakti of being irresponsible. Even when he left home unannounced, there would be slips tucked around mentioning how much milk he had fed our daughter before leaving. He would stay up at night to apply cold compress if our children ran high temperature or clean up if they puked, she recalls.But dealing with his alcohol habit wasnt easy. It added to Minakshis woes of running a financially unstable household. She would burst out in anger, but her tirade would always be met with silence. He never uttered a word when I shouted, she says. When she left home in anger because of his sudden disappearances, Shakti would write her letters claiming he had left unannounced in search of a job. Minakshi didnt buy those alibis, but she agreed to live with the man who was an iconoclast.Loving and living with a bohemian isnt easy. But Minakshi insists its not an impossibility, when there is trust and dependence. And what is her advice to a girl whos in love with a bohemian? Be friends, but dont get married, she signs off."

On opening them, we found white powder and tests confirmed that it was heroin, said Hari Om Gandhi, director of Ahmedabad zonal unit of NCB.He added that Charles, who is living in Mumbai for four as a clothes trader, is only a carrier while the sender is the drug dealers. During interrogation, he told us that he had received the consignment from another Nigerian. However, he has not revealed the name of the person, said Gandhi.Charles was told that on reaching Mumbai he would get a call from a specific phone number. He had to tell his location to the caller, said Gandhi.NCB officials suspect that the receiver would also be a drug dealer as no consumer of heroin would buy the drug in such a large quantity. Often those addicted to heroin, buy around 50 grams since it is a costly drug, Gandhi said.NCB will now be investigating about the frequency of Charless travels between New Delhi and Mumbai since he has admitted to carrying drugs consignment in the past as well. Though Charles had been living in Mumbai since four years on a business visa, he used to travel between Nigeria and India frequently. Whether he used to carry drugs during his trips between the two countries has not been known. On checking his passport, NCB officials also learnt that his visa had expired on February 28.In June last year, another Nigerian citizen Peter Chinedu Okafor was nabbed from the same Rajdhani Express train with a drugs consignment worth Rs 3.5 crore. Okafor was carrying 255 grams of cocaine, 843 grams of amphetamine and 65 grams of ecstasy tablets. He had admitted of receiving US$ 150 for carrying the drugs.Heroin of Afghan originNCB suspects that the heroin seized from Mamdubueze Nonso Charles is of Afghan origin. According to NCB officials, the heroin which is usually found in India is little brown in colour while the one seized was white, which is found only in Afghanistan. Lately, smuggling of drugs from Afghanistan through Pakistan has increased, officials said.Nigerian claims to be HIV infectedDuring interrogation, Mamdubueze Nonso Charles told investigators is HIV infected. However, NCB will conduct medical tests to confirm this. He must be saying that he is HIV infected so that we go soft on him or for gaining sympathy from us. But we will make him undergo a medical test to know the truth, said NCB official."

He gets 10-odd seizures a minute, keeping him in pain for every living second. It is tough for a father to seek death for his child but his suffering prompted me to seek death for him. I learned about the SC order, I am not familiar about the legalities but will write an application to the apex court, the PM as well as the CM, seeking euthanasia for Parth, Dinesh told TOI.Parth, a resident of Savarkundla in Amreli district, suffers from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare neurological disorder, which causes spasms or jerks and the patient loses control over movement. This viral disease often represents itself in dementia or personality alterations and the patients behaviour turns abnormal and erratic.Parth contracted this illness after a spell of high fever in July 2016. While the fever broke after a few days, the seizures continue unabated. In fact, five months ago he used to suffer a seizure once every 10 minutes, the frequency has now risen to 10 seizures a minute, his parents said.In November 2017, Dinesh wrote to the PM and President, seeking death for his bedridden son who cannot eat, speak and even move. The letter led to the PMO arranging free medical treatment for Parth at AIIMS, Delhi.Parth was given interferon injections, but they did not really help. He was then brought to Civil Hospital for treatment but no treatment really worked. Finally, we brought him home, said Dinesh, who left his job as a diamond polisher and currently sells packets of dal and rice to industrial workers, so he can work from home and look after his son.Either my wife of I have to be with Parth 24x7, as there is always fear of him falling due to the constant seizures, said Dinesh, who also has an older daughter. May God not curse anybody with debilitating diseases but when such aberrations happen, the right to die will help end misery for which medical science has no answer, Dinesh said.SSPE is a disease where the patient neither live nor dies. The SC verdict allowing passive euthanasia will give relief to such patients and their relative from mental, psychological and financial distress, said Dr Jaimin Shah , head of neurosurgery department at Civil Hospital."

After recording his statement, police along with Sukhdevs elder son Jatinder went to Neelon to trace Vipin, who also worked as an autorickshaw driver. Near the bus stand, Jatinder spotted Vipin standing near his autorickshaw (PB1310CL-2606).During interrogation, Vipin admitted to have axed the family. He said Sukhdev and his family had been visiting him for the past one year. One day, Sukhdev told him that he had sold sold his land. Thinking that he must have kept the money at home, Vipin went to his house on March 1 and asked him to make boiled rice and throw its water in Neelon canal for good luck, Shukla added.The sorcerer then gave them sedative-laced water. He asked them to go to separate rooms, lay on the mats and close their eyes for prayers. When they slipped into unconsciousness, he first slaughtered Sukhdev and then Gurmeet. On hearing his parents shrieks, Harjot woke up. But Vipin told him that the noises were part of a ritual. He then slaughtered him as well after tying his hands, said Ludhiana range deputy inspector general Gursharan Singh Sandhu.Vipin ransacked the house, but found no money. Even as he left the axe on a bed, he made off with two mobile phones and as many ATM cards. One of the mobile phones and an ATM card, besides the sedatives, have been recovered from his house, the cop added.Inspector general of police said both Sukhdev and Vipin had met at a dera. Sukhdev had told Vipin a fortnight ago that he had 15 kilograms of poppy husk at home which would fetch him a pretty penny.Police said Sukhdev frequented the dera was desperate for good times for his family as his younger son couldnt go to Germany for work and wanted good job for his elder son apart from good luck for his family so he hired the services of Tantrik. They added that the familys earning was just around Rs.9000 of which they would Rs.2500 as rent.Sukhdev had left job some months ago: SSP Khanna Navjot Singh Mahal said that Sukhdev was doing job of Chowkidar at a factory in Dhandari Kalan area of Ludhiana but had quit the job some months ago."

We have started the case based on a complaint by a nationalized bank. The searches on Friday have led to recovery of incriminating documents, said a CBI spokesperson .CBIs FIR alleged that the directors had entered into a conspiracy with the empanelled lawyer, the chief manager and deputy manager-level officials. In 2009 and 2014, they availed a cash credit limit of Rs 4.45 crore for a rice mill. After a few months, the company stopped paying interest and the principal amount. The loan turned into an NPA and increased to Rs 4.12 crore.During searches, CBI stumbled upon a similar mode of operation used by the directors while taking loans in the names of another company they had floated. The directors, all residents of Burdwan, had taken a loan of Rs 29.23 crore from the bank to set up a food processing unit. The company eventually acquired a rice mill and funds were diverted. Some time after the acquisition, the company started reporting shortage of working capital. The directors applied for restructuri-ng the loan limi-ts but that didnt help. As the company started defaulting on payments, the bank reported the case to CBI.While probing the case, CBI officials found that a director of the company had gifted the food processing unit to his son while the property was mortgaged to the bank. His son re-mortgaged the same property to a second company and took loans. Eventually he applied for a loan of Rs 4.12 core for the second company.The loan was given to him while ignoring the past records and the new loan turned into an NPA in a similar way."

The project will be implemented on a pilot basis in Sattenapalle mandal of Guntur district and based on it the project will be extended to remaining parts of the state.Giving a serious thought to chief minister Chandrababu Naidus instructions to encourage healthy food habits, the civil supplies department has readied a plan to slowly replace white rice with brown rice from PDS shops. Several studies have shown that white rice is one of the chief culprits in spreading diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in the state. Brown rice is best for health and hence we decided to go for it, said civil supplies minister Prattipati Pulla Rao.Incidentally, it was TDPs first government under NT RamaRao that launched Rs 2 per kg rice scheme in 1983. The move had revolutionised the food habits of the state. People, who used to consume millets particularly in rural areas, suddenly shifted to rice after NTRs rice scheme started.Rs 2 per kg rice was started keeping in view the poverty in those days. Although, it helped achieve the goal to some extent, it turned into a villain over the years, said social activist SVS Lakshminarayana. The NTRs rice scheme has brought the consumption of jowar, raagi and other millets to zero while people fell in love for more white, silky and shiny the rice, he felt.We need to switch to the old days. We strongly advise people to go for brown rice to reduce the risk levels, said Dr VV Ram Kumar, a noted diabetologist. He said an Indian study showed brown rice lowers risk of rising blood sugar at least by 20 per cent when compared to white rice.When polished rice grains loose outer bran and germ layers it results in the loss of many vital nutrients and fibre in the bran. It is left with starchy endosperm which is easily digested and increases blood sugar, analysed Dr Ram Kumar."

Right to food (RTF) activists Ramdev Vishwabandhu and Vishwanath Singh on Monday visited her house to investigate the reasons of her death. Savitris family had applied for a ration card almost a year ago, which she never got. Her family and elder daughter-in-law said she didnt get any money even though her old-age pension had been sanctioned in 2014, Vishwabandhu said.When the RTF activists visited the Chainpur branch of Allahabad Bank on Monday, they found that Rs 1,800 had been credited to Savitris account on April 4, 2018. This seems to have happened four years after her old-age pension had been sanctioned. Her account was opened on January 21, 2014 but not a single paisa was put there all these months. After visiting her bank a few times between 2014 and 15, she lost hope and stopped going there, Vishwabandhu said.Block pramukh Yashoda Devi said Savita Devis family has been living in abject poverty.

Hulas is yet to find work.Deputy commissioner Manoj Kumar said when an officer visited the village he found Savitri had been very ill for quite some time and was being looked after by her relatives. In his report to the CMs office, Kumar wrote, Villagers, as part of local custom, gave her food of her choice in her last days. She hadnt withdrawn her pension amount of Rs 1,800 since April. So, the cause of her death is not due to hunger (sic).On Monday, when officials from the land and revenue department visited the village, they found that Savitris family owns land measuring 25 decimals."

The project has not been given official approval and faces many obstacles.DOHA: The year-old acrimonious dispute between Qatar and its neighbours is forging a ""new"" Gulf, potentially transforming what was a stable region of the Arab world, experts warn.It has shattered old alliances and rendered the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council practically obsolete, pushing Qatar towards Turkey and Iran.And with no sign of a resolution, it is unclear if any party has benefitted.""In its impact on the regional unit in the Arab Gulf , the crisis is likely to be as disruptive and as era-defining as Saddam Hussein's invasion and occupation of Kuwait was in 1990,"" said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute.""It is very difficult to see how the Arab Gulf can come back together.""The crisis between some of the world's richest countries erupted on June 5, 2017 as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt suddenly cut all ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and Iran.Qatar, a small peninsula nation, found its only land border closed, its state-owned airline barred from using its neighbours' airspace, and Qatari residents expelled from the boycotting countries.Doha was handed a list of 13 demands, including closing broadcaster Al Jazeera, removing Turkish troops from the country, and scaling back its cooperation with Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field.Qatar has done none of these. Instead it has responded defiantly by dismissing the charges and courting new diplomatic and trading links.The cold war in the desert has lingered, although Qatar still supplies the UAE with gas.As new axes emerge, Qatar has increasingly tied itself to Turkey -- while straining relations between Riyadh and Ankara -- and extended its reach far beyond the Gulf.Last month, Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani thanked Iran for its support during the crisis.""I don't think it is too far-fetched to say that new power centres in the Middle East are emerging,"" said David Roberts, assistant professor at King's College London.Widely seen as a bid by Saudi Arabia and the UAE to bring to heel Qatar and its support for the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, the gamble has not paid off -- yet.While their regional ambitions may have been overstretched, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have indicated this is a power-play for the long haul.According to Le Monde newspaper, Saudi Arabia has written to French President Emmanuel Macron warning of ""military action"" if Qatar goes ahead with its planned purchase of a Russian air defence missile system.Qatar is already picking up the tab, as it absorbs the huge costs of regional isolation, despite its vast wealth in gas resources.""As for winners and losers, there are clearly no winners thus far, and in many ways everyone has been a loser,"" said Christopher Davidson, a Middle East politics professor at Durham University.Ulrichsen said that despite its ""resilience"", Qatar has ""not eliminated the costs of the crisis"".Without a clear winner in sight, the Gulf crisis is largely seen by the outside world as a bewildering spat between indistinguishable former allies.Mediation efforts have been led by Kuwait and the US, which has its largest Middle East air base in Qatar.Kuwait's deputy foreign minister, Khaled al-Jarallah, said diplomatic efforts are ""ongoing"".""The latest of these efforts and ideas will be presented during a Gulf-American summit in September, and this summit will be an opportunity to end this crisis,"" he told AFP.US President Donald Trump seemed firmly behind the Saudis at first, but has since called Sheikh Tamim a ""great gentleman"" and urged a peaceful outcome.In the muddle, corruption allegations against Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have surfaced over his dealings with the Gulf states, notably Qatar.Diplomacy may eventually be supplanted by imperatives such as Saudi domestic concerns or weariness over its joint military efforts with the UAE in the Yemen war.The crisis has impacted east African states with alliances to the Gulf, rewarded defence contractors, and may have massive ramifications for Qatar's 2022 football World Cup.With nationalism in the Gulf on the rise, Roberts said ""the crisis has been an opportunity for Qataris to demonstrate their national fervour"".Saudis, for their part, have used social media to poke fun at their tiny neighbour, while Qataris mutter darkly about Emiratis.It ""has created animosities that may take years, even a generation, to overcome"", said Ulrichsen."

The aroma of fuming kebabs and fried chicken will take you places while your eyes feast on stacks of vermicelli, dates and breads sold in small street stalls. The medley of cultural influences is richer than the food served. As par t of the Ramzan celebrations, Raipur Times takes you to a food walk in one of the oldestlanesin the city. With Badi Masjid in the backdrop, the outer lane (Urdu Bazaar Road) is lit up with kebab shops. Among many, Lalus and Qureshis stall is 80 years old. The slender and juicy kebabs are served hot off the griddle and put you in the mood. These are the softest kebabs that youll find and full of flavour. Ours is a family business and for generations we are selling kebabs here. During iftar time, we serve over 200 people from different communities. During Ramzan time, we reduce our prices to half so that more people can come and savour kebabs here, says Qureshi Mian, owner of the shop. You can eat kebabs here at Rs 40 a plate which comes with four kebabs.Just ahead of Bilal, head here for some serious feasting. Pieces of meat are cooked for hours along with saffron flavoured rice to give you a place of delicious biryani, without which your food trail will be incomplete. The Mirchi Masala Biryani is a must try at Mota Pehelwaan which is a 100-years old Biryani seller in the area. The mirch masala biryani is aOriginally from Uttar Pradesh, youll find his food carts dotted across the lane selling a blush pink drink popularly called Pyaar Mohabbat Maza sold in Rs 30. This refreshing concoction is a mix of watermelon, milk and Rooh Afza. It's fragrant, its light and its got these gorgeous chunks of watermelon and it is a must have during summer and Ramzan, shares the seller of the drink Nizam Khan.The nihari at Bilal is so sublime that its absolutely worth elbowing your way to get here. A plateful of nihari with moti roti is very popular among the people. The meat is slow-cooked for hours to make it delicate and tender. It is then simmered in gravy with a mix of spices handed by our grandmother we served it with squeeze of lime juice and green chillies. We also serve haleem. The combination is traditional and people prefer it that way, says Mohammad Iqbal, owner of the 50-year old stall.Turn left right opposite Gate no 1 to enter Matia Mahal and head straight to Haji Mohammad Hussains. At Haji Mohammad, try the fried chicken which is served with red chutney. But people mostly make a beeline for keema golis. During Ramzan, Haji also serves Keema Golis (minced meat rounds served with onions). If you reach here around iftar time, youll manage to get your hands on them. People buy them in kilos for iftar parties too, says one Razia Hussein, who comes here twice a week to savour keema golis from the other side of the city Naya Raipur.After savouring fried food, you come across those large platters of beautifully decorated shahi tukda and matka phirni you know you cant resist. Golden fried slices of bread simmered in milk and topped with khoya and desi ghee made our lips curl into a smile every time we tucked in a bite. You can buy them at the popular Haji Bhai stall opposite Matia Mahal in Rs 20."

She was scared. Little did she know, that 25 years later she would go on to circumnavigate the globe, criss-crossing four oceans. Meet Lt Commander Aishwarya Boddapati , who was part of the six-member, all woman team of the Indian Navy , which made history by circumnavigating the Earth in eight months, on board INS Tarini. Hyderabad Times caught up with the 29-year-old Hyderabadi, and as she got chatting, it felt like we too were on board Tarini, voyaging vicariously. Excerpts.The idea of an expedition of this kind by Indians was first mooted by retired Vice Admiral Manohar P Awati. He believed that Indians too should circumnavigate the earth in an Indian-made boat. In 2006, the idea was officially accepted. a boat suitable for such a journey was built from scratch and thus, INSV Mhadei was born. Since then, two officers of the Indian Navy have circumnavigated the globe. First was Captain Dilip Donde , Shaurya Chakra awardee who was the first Indian to complete his voyage in 2010. But he did so with stops during his voyage. Few years later, Navy decided we should up our game, and so it was Commander Abhilash Tomy , who did the non-stop circumnavigation over a period of 156 days. Then, to set another record, Navy finally decided to call for an all-women team to carry forward the legacy. And the rest, as they say, is history.I joined the Navy in 2011, and was always keen on water sports and rigorous training. three years later, in 2014, when they called out for volunteers for this voyage, I thought, why not give it a try? Of the 500 women officers in the Naval force, 30 of us volunteered. I was posted in Port Blair when the call for the selection came in 2015. Incidentally, my parents had come down to visit me, so I packed them off on a vacation to Havelock Island and snuck off to Goa for the selections. after a week-long selection procedure, I was among the six others selected for this prestigious project. But to be honest, I had no clue about ocean sailing. infact, in my initial joining days, I was petrified of swimming in the sea.Well, it wasnt just the fear of swimming in the sea that I had to overcome. At the selection, they told us clearly about all the sacrifices that we had to make for this voyage  both professional and personal. We would be taken out from our primary services in the Navy so that we could concentrate on this completely. That meant not contributing to our units, and therefore, it could be a set back professionally since it affects promotions. In fact, a lot of senior officers advised me against going for the expedition. Navy was also considering giving permanent commission for women, so a voyage could have set me back amongst peers. Personally, a base posting gives you the advantage of being able to rush home if something is wrong. But this called for a two-year commitment; no turning back. I was single at that time, and parents were looking for prospective grooms. Since I would have to be away for two years, my folk thought that it wasnt such a great idea. Even if they found a good match, how many would be open to the idea of their prospective daughter-in-law going off to the sea for eight months? But I had to think it through and balance it all out and make a decision. My parents did have some reservations but I told them casually, that I need some stories to tell my grandchildren, so let me go make them!we were trained by the best  Captain Donde, the first Indian to do the circumnavigation. He taught us everything from scratch. From navigation, signals, study of stars, we did it all. But the best thing he told us was that the sea knows no gender, so we better learn everything if we want to survive it.Its an out and out make in India boat! Right from selecting the wood, to the kind of equipment on board, we planned everything about her with the boatmakers. When compared to INSV Mhadei, it is more spacious to accommodate a six-member crew. It was tailormade for women sailors. For instance, we thought who needs that 6-feet bunker bed that was on Mahdei? So we made our beds smaller, and that extra space was used up for storage purpose. the kitchen was also made much larger. So yeah, that way it had our touch. We all are very attached to her. in fact, we even celebrated her birthday on board.(Laughs) Yes! We even cut a cake for her. we used to bake cakes for all special occasions. We celebrated birthdays, Christmas, New Year, crossing the equator, all with cakes! In fact, we would also offer a slice to Varuna, the Indian god of the oceans. so yeah, we had fun that way! We were six girls coming from different culinary backgrounds. So we also did a lot of cooking! None of us started out as great cooks, but the journey demanded that we become good at it. We made dal makhani, chole, dosas, snails, and even pizzas. I dont think any man at sea would have ever thought of doing this!Well, I made curd rice the first few days. I mixed it with kandisunni podi. The others were so fascinated seeing Swati (from Vizag) and me eat it. Soon, the podi was being added in every dish, be it dal, rice, or pizza! The gongura pickle and murukus my mom sent along were over in like 20 days, though she had packed enough to last a few months. Mom also had sent some dosa mix, with which I made quick dosas for everyone.Oh, I missed the ice creams! And, my moms home made food. We had no refrigeration in the boat, so we couldnt store ice-creams and meat. My manipuri teammate packed a lot of dried meat for the journey to keep herself happy. You see, food is one thing that gets you going in the tough conditions.Pretty daunting. I mean, mentally. Being on sea for eight months is not a joke. It affected all of us emotionally. Thankfully, I had my best friend Pratibha with me  we had joined the Navy together. So during idle hours we would talk about how we would plan our wedding etc. I even carried some colouring books and sailing books to read. that kept me going. Vijaya was interested in quilling and made some very cool stuff; she even knit sweaters! So, we all found one hobby and pursued it during our free hours. Apart from that we did have our regular chores of keeping watch, repairing, cooking etc., to do. WhatsApp calling was a huge plus, I dont know what it would have been like if I did not get to speak to my family daily!We use the satellite to get internet connectivity, but that was merely 600 mb per day for the entire crew, and that too was highly expensive. to reduce our consumption, we used a firewall, and were allowed to use only 100 mb a day. I used it mainly to make a video call at sharp 7:30 am IST to speak to my family. I also made calls to my fiance, Rajashekhar with whom I had gotten engaged in July 2017. Once, I even wished a friend  he was so happy that I called him from the sea! one of our teammates fiance sent her a special birthday video and we all sacrificed our MB to download it and surprise her. She was very emotional!Yes, even now, after the voyage is over, I still feel their presence! When you stay with someone for eight months, there is very little you can hide about your true character! In fact, we could sense easily if something was wrong with the other, if someone was cranky cos of no food, or if someone was missing home. We bonded beautifully! In fact you know that myth that when women stay together, their periods sync? Its true! We all would get our periods one after the other and it was so good to have them take care of me!Oh yes! It was on January 7, 2018. we were at the Pacific Ocean and it clearly was the toughest 20 hours of our life because out of nowhere we were hit by a storm that brought in huge waves! The sky was filled with dark clouds and the sails were down to the minimum. Throughout the storm, we were awake, and alert. At one point, I was on the watch at the deck and this huge wave, as tall as a three storey building crashed on us. When it fell, for 5-10 seconds I was inside the water, and I really thought I was off the boat. Now, if you are off the boat, then there is very little chance to retrieve you because its a vast space and you just drift away. I was sure my end was near, but then suddenly the water went away and I could see my skipper heading towards me. After those 20 hours, we reached Cape horn and saw the most beautiful rainbow. The sky was clear, there were dolphins jumping beside us. I think I saw god in the sky that day!You wont believe this, but everything they showed in the movie really happens  we saw it all! Remember that scene where the ocean lights up? Thats totally real. one night, our boat was crossing a calm part of the ocean, and these bio luminescent organisms were strewn across the surface of the water. As our boat passed by, they got disturbed and lit up and we left a trail of light behind us. we could see all kinds of marine life then...When we met PM Modi, he quoted Neil Armstrong and told us, I went as an astronaut and returned as a human being. This voyage has changed my life completely. I was stubborn, fussy and impatient, and all those vices have gone now! At home, I would be picky about food, but I know to respect everything more. Even in my personal relationships, I think I have grown closer to everyone around me.Before leaving for the voyage, my parents were worried if I would find a match, because of the absurdity of what I was doing. When I did find one, it was almost time to leave and I did not know what stress it would put on the initial days of our relationship. But every day, he would be there as my pillar of support. Some days when things went terribly wrong on the ship, I would only call him and tell him about the situation and leave it completely on him to handle my nervous parents. So, he really helped me along the way. In fact there was this one moment, when we had to pull over at Mauritius for an emergency repair on the boat. I was so low that it happened on the last leg of our journey, and knowing my state of mind, he flew down to Mauritius to meet me! I still cant believe that happened, that certainly has to be the best surprise ever for me! But the best part is, once you have circumnavigated the earth, everything else feels achievable, I mean, what can be tougher than that?"

And Dunga himself had been hired in 2014 to resurrect a team reeling from the ultimate humiliation of that 7-1 loss to Germany in the semi-finals of the World Cup on Brazilian soil.By the time Tite took over, Brazil had already played a third of their qualifying games for the 2018 tournament and Tite wondered whether he'd have time to turn the slow-motion disaster around.Immediately after getting the job, ""I said to myself... 'What if I don't manage to qualify?'"" he told TV Globo recently.Tite, 57, says his wife Rose looked at him in concern. ""I can't figure out what you're thinking,"" she said.But the devout Catholic, who has a shrine to the Virgin Mary in his office, did more than just sort out his thoughts. In seven months he pulled the team from the brink and turned them into winners, comfortably topping the South American qualifying group.They go to the World Cup in Russia as one of the hot favourites.Tite's emotional and eloquent way of talking and his father-figure status in the dressing room were key in healing the mental scars of talented, young players who'd known so many setbacks. Tite didn't have to make wholesale changes to the squad -- he only had to bring out the best in what he already had.A fan of typical Brazilian rice and beans, washed down with the potent cachaca-based cocktail caipirinha, Tite brought a sense of fun back to a side afflicted by fear and nerves.His achievement has made him one of Brazil's favourite national figures. A poll even found that he would stand a good chance in a presidential run.Tite plays down the hype. ""I am not a saint,"" he told Folha de Sao Paulo.But there's no question how much the role means to him. He describes crying for a week after the 2014 loss to Germany, when he waited in vain for a call from the Brazilian Football Confederation to take over.""When I wasn't chosen... I felt frustrated, angry and very sad,"" he said. ""But right then I thought of my mother. She was a fighter. Whenever our family had problems, she'd start working even harder,"" he told The Players' Tribune."

Both the agriculture department and the Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) have written to the related authorities that Navara rice is a traditional variety of Kerala and it is being cultivated in different parts of the state, said the minister.The minister pointed out that the rice variety is also commonly used in ayurvedic health care system in Kerala due of its medicinal value. So, the government has informed the authorities in charge of implementing the PPVFR Act that the ownership rights of the Navara belongs to the farmer community of Kerala and not to a particular individual, Sunilkumar said.Earlier there were attempts to get geographical indication tag to Navara saying that this was a rice variety exclusively being cultivated in Palakkad. The government and the KAU had objected to this then, saying it was being produced in different parts of the state, he added. Sunilkumar said some NGOs were also making efforts to wrest the IP rights of germplasms of the crop varieties of Kerala, through dubious means.The minister said that the state government is setting up a seed bank to conserve the seeds and planting materials of traditional crops as well as newly-developed crop varieties. Sunilkumar said the government has decided that only those, who have undergone a course in pesticide management will be given license to start pesticide retail outlets in state. He said the decision has been taken as part of the measures to regulate the use of pesticides. This will be like pharmacy training being mandatory condition for getting a pharmacy licence, he clarified.He said each retail outlet will be directed to keep strict data on the sale of each pesticide, including the purchaser, the area and crops where it was being used and under whose advice. The enforcement wings under the agriculture department will strengthened to ensure that these directions are complied with."

Popularly known in Marathi as Saat Baara Utara , the document was introduced in the early 20th century and gives information like the name of a plots owner, its area and its cultivatorit is thus a record of agricultural land . The suburban collectors decision is in line with the state governments plan to scrap 7/12 extracts in all urban areas of Maharashtra, where every plot now has a city survey number.Suburban collector Sachin Kurve told TOI there are currently 87,000 Saat Baara Utara records between Bandra and Dahisar and from Kurla to Mulund. Of these, 58,000 have been done away with after tallying them with the property cards of landowners. Kurve said that since most agricultural plots in Mumbai were converted for non-agricultural purpose decades ago, it does not make sense to continue with the 7/12 document anymore. At the beginning of the last century, much of the land in Mumbais suburbs was used for cultivation and thus the prevalence of Saat Baara Utaras , meant only for agriculture land.Kurve said that for long, a land owner in Mumbai had to produce both property card as well as the 7/12 document. Only a property card to prove land ownership in urban areas should suffice, said Kurve.The document must tally with the city survey number of the land. If there are discrepancies, then we cannot scrap the 7/12 extract.Mariam Dossal, city historian and author of the book `Theatre of Conflict, City of Hope, said, The property registration form 7/12, I surmise, recorded agricultural land holdings on Salsette Island (the island on which Mumbai, Mira-Bhayander and part of Thane lie), which over time after 1914 were converted into urban settlements under the Salsette Town Planning Scheme. It may be that the Saat Baara was also used to record holdings on parts of coconut plantations and rice fields that existed in Mahim, Matunga, Dadar and Worli and the northern sections of Bombay island, which existed well into the mid-twentieth century. It is worth investigating further.Retired bureaucrat Dev Mehta, who was once Mumbai metropolitan commissioner, said the 7/12 extract is like God for landowners. In popular Marathi Lavani songs, the protagonist asks the man to prove if he is rich or poor by showing his Saat Baara, said Mehta.In the 1970s, Mehta said, the state introduced the Khate Pustika, a substitute land record document for the 7/12. But the Saat Baara was not abolished then. It is pointless to have both a property card and the 7/12 extract in urban areas. Scrapping 7/12 is a good move by the government.IAS officer Shekhar Gaikwad, who has done extensive studies on land records, said it was FGH Anderson (commissioner of settlements and land records), who streamlined and created a system to collect land revenue in villages in Maharashtra. Form 7 pertains to the title of the property and form 12 contains details of the cultivation and crops grown on the land, he explained. Saat Baara has become an inseparable part of the life of an agriculturalist. Any mention of 7/12 creates an emotion of scare as well as suspicion in the minds of farmers mainly because of his attachment to the land. Therefore, 7/12 is rightly called a mirror of land."

Baked vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes are made for the guests usually during this season.""Working women prefer to cook tasty, but less time consuming dishes while keeping in mind the calorie content in the food they make. Nagina Tarranum , a teacher from Kharghar , said, ""After breaking the fast, people have a tendency to gorge on full meal cooked with fats and unsaturated oil to bring the typical taste of iftaar. While in my family we are very strict about our daily diet during Ramzan because greasy food causes fatigue and gives trouble while offering namaz, we take lots of fresh fruit juices and green leafy vegetables to cleanse our digestive tracts. The age-old tradition of greasy meal meant for iftaar is now slowly decreasing and people are instead trying to be more health conscious by opting for baked dishes and green leafy vegetables."" Afsana Sheikh, another homemaker from Koperkhairane , has restricted her family's diet even for suhoor, the early morning meal.""The concept of suhoor has been converted currently to plain roti or rice and green curry with seasonal vegetables along with fresh fruits to keep our stomach clean and healthy during the festive season,"" she said."

While some are keeping their pooches cooped in in air-conditioned rooms, those working with the strays in the city, have built shelters for the animals to rest under. Talking about the steps they are taking to prevent their pets from suffering a heat stroke, pet parents tell us how they are helping their babies stay cool.For Enakshi Chandel, owner of over a dozen Labradors, the first step is to change the dogs diet. ""During summers , I stop giving my dogs meat in their food and give them lots of mattha to drink,"" shares Chandel adding, ""From April end onwards, my dogs remain indoors till sunset with the AC on most of the time.""Vishakha Shukla feeding her pet dog ice cream to beat the heat (BCCL)Soban Ahmad Khan, who has a pet cat, makes sure that his cat doesn't go out of the room during daytime as he is quite active, unlike other cats. ""Jordan being such an active cat, doesn't sit for long at the same place, therefore we lock the room where he can sit and chill in the AC during daytime. We also give him a bath which is a very challenging task as cats hate water,"" says he laughing. ""We give only liquid diet like milk, coconut water or glucose in the afternoon to keep him hydrated, rest, he eats little meat for breakfast and dinner when the temperature falls down a little.""Another vital thing for pet parents to take into consideration in this heat is when to take your pet for a walk. ""I have seen, several people take their dogs out for a walk when the sun is high. That's an absolute no-no,"" says Vishakha Shukla, a pet parent. ""Its best to take your pets out for walks either early in the morning or late in the evening when its cooled down. What happens is that when the pets walk on metalled roads, their paws get burned and they also tend to get tired easily because of the heat. The pets must have access to water all the time and it should be changed every few hours and kept in a cool place,"" she adds.Arti Agarwals pet, a guinea pig, chilling in a copper tub and Alop Ghosh with his Great Dane (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)For Alop Ghosh, a businessman, who has several Great Danes, Labradors and Alsatians at his home, along with parakeets and macaws, keeping his pets cool is quite a task. ""I have designated a man just to ensure that all animals are looked after in this heat. I have put coolers in the room where the dogs stay during the day and give them a fresh water rinse every evening,"" says Alop, who also advises change in diet for the dogs. ""Give them food which is light on their stomach. Curd and rice becomes a major part of my dogs' diet during summers. Also I prefer to use earthen ware for their drinking water,"" he adds.Dr Arti Agarwals pet, a guinea pig, has been given a copper vessel full of water to sit and chill whenever she wants. ""She would literally pant in heat. She would sit in an AC room yet she also wanted to roam about the house at her free will. So after a lot of brainstorming, the idea of making her a swimming pool of her own struck us and so we got an old copper vessel, filled it with water and now she sits in it most of the time,"" says she.Vishakha also loves to indulge her pets with ice creams during summers. Dogs love ice creams and ice cubes. ""Mine love to lick on to milk bars and it cools them off too. A strategy thats also followed by Arundhati, parent of two dogs and seven pups. I put lots of ice in the drinking water of our dogs. That keeps the water cool and also the dogs. Our Alsation especially loves to chew on ice cubes,"" laughs Arundhati, adding, ""In the evening, when I'm watering the garden, I let the dogs play in the water and they love it.""Cyrus Cowasji, who has an animal farm with a variety of animals including buffaloes, horses, ducks and dogs, has built a pool on his property. Cyrus also focuses on the greenery within his property as it helps a lot in keeping the temperature cool. ""To keep the animals cool we have installed fans and the staff gives bath to the animals twice a day. Larger animals like my cows and horses stay under their shed during the day after they have been given a bath during feeding time,"" says Cyrus, adding, ""Other pets which live in a natural enclosures have trees and greenery around them that keeps the farm cool. As we dont cut our trees within the property, our farm within the gates is much cooler as compared to the temperature outside. We also have a swimming pool where the dogs are taken for a swim to cool off. Of course they have to share the pool with our ducks and the buffalo too, says Cyrus with a chuckle.Caroline Borges has made shelters for strays (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)When it comes to taking care of the strays in summers, Caroline Borges, a school teacher, leaves no stone unturned. From an ice-cream party to making a shelter for them outside her house, Caroline does it all. As summer approaches, I build a small canopy right outside the boundary wall of my house, where the strays take shelter from the scorching sun, says Caroline, who has also kept matkas and earthen bowls for the strays to drink water from. Caroline adds, While people have fun and masti with their pets, I have ice-cream or maybe a watermelon party with my pets every weekend.GROOMING IS A MUSTA dog enjoying a pool bath (BCCL)With ticks being a common problem, its imperative to keep your pooches free of the pests. While many think that by cutting their pets hair, they will help the pooch cool down, yet vets advise otherwise. Grooming is very important during summers as ticks are very common these days, says Vishakha, who also grooms pets. Do bathe your pets regularly and brush their fur too. Do not cut their hair too short. Hair works as an insulator for the skin and if you shave it off, you will actually expose the pet to heat. Regular application of anti-tick powders, shampoos, liquids are very helpful. Also a generous application of a mixture made with one part Apple Cider Vinegar and ten parts water should keep the mites away,"" says Vishakha. Itishree.Misra@timesgroup.com and Adnaan Rizvi"

The department has now asked the park owner to come to their office and explain the lack of proper entry into the park and fire-fighting equipment.Giving details, fire officer Yashpal Rai said he had asked the park owner, Randeep Singh , to come to his office and explain why there was no adequate fire-fighting system in place at the park. He added that there was no proper entry for fire tenders to get inside the park, which is necessary for such a system. The NOC (if any) for the park was not given during my tenure, so we will have to check whether they have it. It is important for such parks to have an NOC from the fire department, said the fire officer. He added that their team faced a problem in dousing the flames, as there was no proper entry into the park, and they had to park their vehicles in the neighbouring godown.The fire officer said before the fire incident, students of a school in Rara Sahib had visited the park, and were lucky to return before fire engulfed the park. He added that six members of the team were engaged in the fire-fighting operation, and they had brought four fire tenders  two from Khanna, and one each from Samrala and Gobindgarh  for the operation.Fire department officials said their main worry was that thousands of tonnes of rice polish was stored in a godown near the site of fire. Rice polish is an inflammable substance, and if that had caught fire, it would created havoc. They added that about 60-70% of the park infrastructure was destroyed in the fire, the cause of which is being ascertained.The fire officer said no one was trapped inside the park at the time of the incident, and the chowkidar fled from the spot. He added that there was fire in a field nearby, which spread to the park."

She lamented that her husband had come from Sri Lanka to India in 1981 to escape getting killed like many other Tamils. But he was destined to get killed by a bullet here, she wailed. Kandhaiah, a construction worker, was the sole breadwinner of the family.Though everyone here knows that the man who fought for the rights of the common man is no more, his 27-year-old son Jagadeeswaran is yet to realise it. The boy who has a learning disability since birth and he misses his father, whom he has been waiting for near the condolence banner near his house, said his cousin S Roopkumar, 33. The family and residents of Ceylon Colony are worried about the boy as he has been refusing to eat since Tuesday. His father would not only feed him but fullfils his sons every need. Today, we force-fed him rice as he should not grow weak. He cannot talk but we are able to understand from his acttions that he misses his father, said Selvamani.Relatives said that the man decided not to have any more children as he wanted to give dedicated attention to the boy. Jagadeeswaran would sleep hugging his father and has been spending sleepless nights since Tuesday.The state had promised a job for a family member of those killed in the police firing based on their educational qualifications. However, Kandhaiahs son is not only illiterate but also cannot go to work as he cannot take care of himself. His mother has to be at home to take care of her son. The family felt that the government could consider providing the job to a guardian to help the family."

Cotton production fell by a steep 39% mainly due to pest attack by the pink bollworm, which devastated the crop across regions.One crop to thrive was the water-guzzling sugarcane, which saw a rise of 34% over the previous year and has contributed to a bumper nationwide production. Kharif is the main agricultural season in Maharashtra , in which three-quarters of farming is done. The states monsoon was 84% of normal last year, but in July 2017 dipped to 72% and in August to 77% of normal. But compared to five-year averages, production of kharif food grains and pulses saw a slight increase of 9% in 2017-18.Crop credit dips 40%, pushing farmers towards loan sharksThe decline in the production of food grains compared to 2016-17 was mainly because of a dry spell and uneven rainfall, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Bijay Kumar has said.In addition, the output of rice was affected by an attack of sucking pests and cotton was impacted by the pink bollworm pest, he said. Farm activists point out that its not just crop production which has declined, but also the prices of farm produce.Prices for most crops are lower than they were last year and farmers are facing larger debts. Crop loans from banks have declined by 40%, so, farmers have had no option but to turn to moneylenders, said activist Vijay Jawandhia . The production of kharif cereals declined by 4% compared to the previous year and oilseeds by 15%, estimates from the state agriculture department show.The production of rice declined by as much as 22% over the previous year. In 2016-17, the state saw a bumper production of tur dal, pushing up pulse production figures.In 2017-18, tur production in the kharif season declined by 49% and moong production by 37% compared to the previous year. Within kharif oilseeds, soya bean production dipped by 15% and groundnut by 11%. Sesamum (sesame is the best-known member of the genus) declined by 48%.In the rabi season (winter crop), cereal production saw a 30% decline in 2017-18 compared to the previous year, while the production of pulses dropped by 10%, estimates show. The state has seen a dramatic rise in sugarcane production, reaching a historic record of over 107 lakh tons.Nationally too, the country has seen a major rise in sugar production.

Against 15.7 lakh metric tonnes of rice and wheat available to the PDS, at least 11.3 lakh metric tonnes was lost to leakages. Thus PDS leakages in Gujarat accounted for 72% of total procurement.Between 2012 and 2014, the state government invalidatedjust 407 bogus cards. Between 2014 and 2017, this number scaled up to more than 1.6 lakh of the 1.27 crore ration card-holding families in Gujarat. The proportion of PDS pilferage was highest in Manipur, Nagaland and Jharkhand.The situation has barely improved in Gujarat. Activists say the state civil supplies departments claims of change caused by Aadhaar seeding are empty. This February, the state government found that its digitally secured PDS biometric database of beneficiaries was fraudulently used to lift subsidized foodgrain in their name and sell it in the market. Surat police arrested a software engineer and five accomplices in the case.Investigations revealed that rations was lifted using cards of prominent persons including the local MP, Darshana Jardosh. The governments claim is false. There are many villages in Gujarat where grain is still distributed using the PDS-biometric database, as many people do not have Aadhaar cards, said Harinesh Pandya , a PDS activist affiliated with the NGO Janpath.At a village in Danta, we came across complaints that PDS store owners would refuse to provide printed coupons for grain that beneficiaries were entitled to and were instead giving them loose chits and then supplying poor quantity grain, saying that proper stock was not available, Pandya said.He added, The whole system is corrupt. How can inclusion of Aadhaar details stop this racket?Pandya pointed out that Aadhaar can only weed out bogus beneficiaries, not plug pilferage. Despite having digital capabilities, the government does not put all stock data in the public domain  like details of foodgrain in godowns, stockists and PDS outlets. There is no reliable or responsive feedback mechanism where people can complain of about being given amounts less than they are entitled to.The Bihar administration tried to plug their PDS leakages by computerization, doorstep delivery of foodgrain, using Global Positioning System to track foodgrain movements and improve transparency. This system, after reducing PDS leakages also encouraged the government to increase coverage of households eligible for PDS cereals from 6.5 million to 12.3 million using its own resources in 2016.Gujarats biometric bar-coded ration PDS coupon system has improved only the accountability and transparency of the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) to ensure cardholders get their rightful rations and leakages are reduced, said a senior civil supplies official."

At least 2,000 parakeets during the summer and 6,000 during the winter make their way twice a day to feed on water-soaked rice laid out by Sekar.But the birds may now have to find another place for feed as Sekar, who has been a resident of the building for 27 years, has been given eviction orders. The landlords have decided to raze the 50-year-old structure. Known popularly as the Birdman, Sekar fears that the parakeets may never gather in such large numbers again if the building is demolished.Every other week, Sekar receives birdwatchers from around the world who are baffled by the daily arrival of the sensitive birds in the noisy and polluted environs of Royapettah . The parakeets flutter away at the noise of a loud horn but within seconds come back to nibble on rice laid out on carefully positioned wooden planks that accommodate thousands of birds at a time.Sekar says, For 15 years I have been feeding the parakeets twice a day. They have never missed a meal. Sekar, who spends nearly half his earnings on bird feed, was invited by the governor of Meghalaya in February to help him increase bird population in the north-eastern state. I had to turn down the invitation as I cannot leave my duty of feeding the birds, says Sekar.Also, the largest collection of antique cameras in the country, the Birdman is fighting to retain the building in its current state and has even made an offer to buy the building. I am willing to give away my collection of 4,500 priceless cameras to anybody who will come to my aid. My savings may not be enough to pay for the building, says Sekar. The camera mechanic spends half his day working and the rest half hosting the birds.Madras Naturalists Society president V M Sudhakar, an avid birdwatcher, says that he has never seen such a large gathering of parakeets in the city before. The daily visit by the parakeets must be the result of years of sustained conditioning. The birds will visit in such large numbers only if they are assured of feed at the same place at the same time every day.The birdman resides in the building along with four other occupants who have all been told to vacate. A joint owner of the building, Neethiselvan says, We are willing to sell the building to anybody who wants to buy it in the interest of preserving it for the birds."

His family has been forced to make a public appeal for donations for just Rs 2 lakh to pay for his hospitalisation.Khobragade, who hails from Nanded village in Nagbid tehsil of eastern Chandrapur, has received more than 100 awards, including the prestigious Presidents award, for his innovations. He was also on Forbes list of seven most powerful rural Indian entrepreneurs whose inventions are changing lives across India in 2010. Khobragade suffered a stroke 3 years ago and his health began deteriorating a few months ago.His son Mitrajit told TOI from Nanded that for the past two years, his father has been on ayurvedic treatment offered free or at minimal cost by a local village doctor. His health started failing over the past few months. We consulted a doctor in Nanded city who suggested that we admit him to a hospital. We were asked to make arrangements for at least Rs 2 lakh, said Mitrajit.After learning of Khobragades plight on social media, digital marketing consultant Sukhada Chaudhary started a crowdfunding campaign for the family to collect Rs 2 lakh for him. By Monday, she had managed to collect close to Rs 1.2 lakh.Khobragade dropped out of school after Class III to help out his family on the farm. In 1982-83, he noticed three yellow seeded paddy spikes in his 1.1-acre field; he had planted the locally available Patel 3 variety of paddy. He picked up the three spikes, brought them home and stored them in a plastic bag for use next year. The following year, he sowed the seeds of this yellow variety separately in the middle of his field and secured this test patch with thorny bushes. When the crop was harvested, he realized that the yield had increased considerably. My father gave these seeds to our neighbours and villagers. Their yield tripled. He suddenly became very famous in the district, recalled Mitrajit.Since the name of the variety was not known, some of Ramajis friends who purchased the seeds decided to call it HMT, after the popular brand of wristwatch that Khobragade wore, said Mitrajit.Although Khobragade got recognition for his work, he could not monetize his seed innovations. In 1997-98, Khobragade had alleged that Panjabrao Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV), an agriculture university based in Akola, was commercializing his variety and had begun to sell it with the name PKV HMT rice. The agriculture university claimed it had purified Khobragades variety.We led a humble life despite all the recognition. My father had to sell his land in 2010 to treat an illness that I had contracted. Later, a political party gave us a five-acre land on which we cultivate today. The past few years have been difficult, though, as our crop failed due to drought, said Mitrajit and added that the family has incurred a debt of Rs 3 lakh."

5b1b200a9855b76d570374eb,When governors use discretion indiscriminately,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/when-governors-use-discretion-indiscriminately/articleshow/64211697.cms,2018-05-18,"On June 1, 1949 the Constituent Assembly witnessed some of the most polarising debates on the role and powers of the governor. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkars assurances did not convince its members. The most persuasive argument for a governor is that such a person would be above political partisanship. But, recent developments raise serious doubts about the role of governors in accord with sentiments expressed by the Constituent Assembly.Article 163 of the Constitution says the governor will be advised by the council of ministers except for functions which require his discretion. The discretionary powers include that of inviting government formation after elections.Recently, a piquant situation arose in Karnataka, where no single party could command a simple majority. This led to the BJP and post-poll allies Congress and Janata Dal (S) both staking claim to form the government. With a fractured mandate, Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala invited BJPs B S Yeddyurappa to form the government and win the trust vote within 15 days.The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in the Rameshwar Prasad vs Union case, said there is nothing wrong in ""post-poll adjustments"" and it can be carried out ""when ideological similarity weighs with any political party to support another political party though there was no pre-poll alliance"". The judgment has been pressed into service before the Supreme Court to challenge Vala's decision.Of late, many governors have been criticised for expanding their discretionary powers suo motu. Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit has been criticised for running a parallel administration of universities within TN and appointing vice-chancellors without consulting the state government. Purohit was already under fire for conducting ""review meetings"" of government schemes.Kerala governor P Sathasivam, a former Chief Justice of India, recently faced an embarrassing situation where an ordinance promulgated by him was stayed by the Supreme Court. While doing so, the apex court found that the ordinance ""blatantly seeks to nullify the binding effect of the order passed by this court"".Puducherrys lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi recently passed a directive linking the distribution of free rice with the sanitation of rural communities in the Union territory. After coming under fire from politicians, activists and academics alike, Bedi retracted this directive in less than 24 hours, but, she continues to step on the toes of the Congress government.The most important function of the governor is to ensure the formation of a stable government in accordance with constitutional principles. Valas decision to invite BJP to form government in Karnataka goes against established constitutional principles and precedents set in the recent cases of Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya. Similarly, in Bihar, a very belated post-poll alliance under Nitish Kumar was given the government reins at the expense of the largest party (Rashtriya Janata Dal) in the state. Looking at the various states, it would seem that discretionary powers of the governors are prone to indiscretion.Now, there is a pressing need to reassess Centre-state relations in general and the functions of the governor in specific. Time is ripe for another inquiry committee along the lines of the one headed by P V Rajamannar to study the constitutional role and scope of governors in the country.(The writer is an advocate and a spokesperson of the DMK)"

Incredible that the Rohingya Muslim refugee should express such optimism when all that he had in his claustrophobic shack as the iftar meal were slices of water melon for himself, his wife and three children to quench their thirst, and afterward a humble meal of rice and vegetables and a cucumber and onion salad.At iftar on the first Friday of the holy month of Ramzan, the family ate in silence under the glow of the white light that highlighted the claustrophobic interiors of their plastic and bamboo shelter. As the sun went down, the same scene played out in the other tents at Kalindi Kunj, where 48 Rohingya families were trying to come to terms with their already burdened lives facing, on April 15, another trial by fire, literally, when their huts were destroyed by a blaze.Some time earlier, around 6pm, men, women and children had all gathered at the new camps lone tap near the entrance, some to wash pots and pans, others to freshen up after a hot, harsh day of fasting. Mohammad Salimullah, who used to run a small shop at the camp that was lost to fire, surveyed the crowd. We have just one water tap for so many families. There always are queues here and the water is not enough for everyones use, he said.On Friday, TOI could sense during its visit to the new camp that amid the trauma of the fire and the financial losses, the families were stoically forgetting their overwhelming challenges and injecting some degree of normalcy in their lives through fasting and praying as if life was routine. The dismal camp site with its wild growth of shrubs and muddy ditches seemed to reflect their fate, but then the refugees seem to have accepted that uncertainty has become a part of their life since they fled Myanmar to escape persecution.There are 25-odd tents in the camp now, each home to three-four families and there is a constant fight for space. The recent storms have added to the misery of the families, leaving them holding dearly on to their possession in their tented home  perhaps wondering how much more they would have to suffer.Their most precious possession appeared to be their refugee document. Ahmed, who works at a graveyard in the vicinity, told TOI that when the fire burnt his shack to the ground, his biggest anxiety was the loss of the UNHCR document establishing his refugee identity. But relief showing on his face, he flashed a brand new card given by the UN body for refugees, and said he hoped to get back on his feet soon.

As night fell, the air grew thick with mosquitoes. The families would eat and sleep early to wake up before dawn in preparation of another day of fasting  and another day of struggle."

Boat owners operate their vessels like auto-rickshaws, as they pick up dozens of villagers and drop them off at various destinations. These boats do not fulfill the requirements of safety measures and they always take on passengers much above the limit, resulting in deadly mishaps.In 1992, a boat capsized near Polavaram , with around 50 people losing their lives. The boat was salvaged and repaired, and is now still in service. The present owner had changed the boats name from Vijayabharathi to Lakshmi Venkateswara and is using the boat to ferry passengers.Another reason being cited as a factor for the mishap is a large number of cement bags loaded on to the boat. Apart from 50 cement bags and 10 rice bags, there were four motorcycles being transported on the boat. When the strong winds destabilised the boat, the overloaded boat was unable to stay upright and drowned. The windows were also closed during the heavy winds, which led to the boat toppling over. The passengers were stuck in the boat and drowned due to the lack of an emergency exit. The 22 people who swam ashore were on the deck when the boat overturned. Former Rampa Chodavaram MLA Seethamsetty Venkateswara Rao said that the boat has met with the accident when it was coming back from Singanapalli after boarding two persons who were waiting on Godavari bund. He observed that tribals have no option other than relying on a boat journey."

The famous Pandian pickle, which is available widely in Tamil Nadu, has its roots in Madurai , where it all began as a cottage industry over half a century ago.Ganeshan started his pickle making unit in a small 1000 square feet area in Madurai, way back in the year mid-1950s. He soon became popular among locals for his quality pickles, which had a good shelf life. Pickling is an art, where the fruit or vegetable being pickled, is cured using traditional recipes which are passed down through the women in the family. The main ingredient is cured in the brine, which is a mixture of the salt and juice of the fruit or vegetable and then tempered with spices. If not prepared in the proper way, the pickle will spoil soon.When local business did well, Ganeshan who was happy with his success, urged his son G Chellasamy to join him to expand the business, which he did after finishing school in 1972. Chellasamy, urged his father to think of expanding their business beyond Madurai, and soon they became a household name in many homes in Tamil Nadu.Their ``matai oorukkai, where they wrap the pickle required for just one meal in a small piece of dry arecanut leaf, became an immediate hit as soon as it was introduced as it was easy to carry, and could be discarded without damaging the environment. Even today, a plate of rice and a ``matai oorukkai is the staple diet of many daily wage earners throughout the state.Then they introduced a slightly improved version, where the single meal pickle was sealed in a sachet for Re. 1 or a slightly bigger packet for Rs 5. But, when the sachet was introduced it sold at just 50 paise. The small manufacturing unit made it difficult for them to meet the demand, and in 2004 they moved to their own premises and set up a unit on a two acre area in Sikkander Chavadi, and mechanised the process, which has helped them to reach to distribute pickles to many states, including Maharashtra and Karnataka A family business, managed by Chellasamy and his younger brothers, Sivagamy Nathan, Kandasamy and Surendran, they are now preparing to export their pickles. Quality has been their motto, say the brothers, which has helped them to stay ahead despite heavy competition from many other brands. ```The competition today is healthy, says Chellasamy.They produce nine types of pickles, but lime, mango, garlic and citron, continue to rule the roost and are in high demand. People from Madurai who live abroad, never fail to take a 300 gram or five kilogram pet jar, back to their homes, as part of their luggage. They have also expanded to making spices, masala powders, and pastes of various curries."

This included a discussion on loans taken by farmers and weavers, from both nationalised and cooperative banks.However, by 11.30am, a rather-deflated Yeddyurappa entered the conference hall of the secretariat to announce the announcement of loan waiver had been deferred.Yeddyurappa was only trying to outdo his predecessor, CM Siddaramaiah,who announced the Rs 4,000-crore Anna Bhagya scheme providing 7kg free rice to every BPL family. According to BJPs manifesto, the waiver of farmers loans totals a whopping Rs 53,000 crore.Informed sources said Yeddyurappas wings were clipped when he first sought for details on the extent of farm and weavers loans from chief secretary Ratna Prabha and the finance department. With the state bureaucracy making it clear it would require time to collate it, Yeddyurappas plans headed southward. Officials said the loan waiver scheme could not be discussed at all, considering there is no scheme in place for it.Briefing the media later on the turn of events, Yeddyurappa said the loan waiver scheme will be implemented in a day or two. While I had assured people that farmers and weavers loans will be waived once I take charge, the chief secretary and the bureaucracy told me they require at least 24 hours to get all the data and details from banks. I assure the people of Karnataka that loans will be waived in a day or two, he said.Later, at a party event to congratulate him, Yeddyurappa admitted that his plan to make headlines with the loan waiver scheme came to nought. I was hoping to announce the waiver for farmers and weavers who had taken loans even from nationalised banks, but it could not be done. However, it will be implemented shortly, he said."

The BJP, which bagged 104 of the 222 seats that went to the polls, has is within striking distance of power despite the many populist schemes launched by the Congress government led by Siddaramaiah We did something for every section of the society and made sure no one was left out... If we do not win despite giving good schemes, programmes and governance, we do not know what else needs to be done. It is now a matter of introspection, said a senior leader, quoting chief minister Siddaramaiahs final speech at the Congress Legislature Party meeting held on Wednesday.In more humiliation for the party, 16 ministers, mainly social welfare A H Anjeneya, revenue Minister Kagodu Thimmappa, women and child development B Umashree, were all defeated, though their departments doled out various Bhagyas for poor and middle-class families. The only saving grace was agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowdas victory by 5671 votes. Byre Gowdas ministry too was steered several schemes for farmers.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah himself was defeated by a huge margin in Chamundeshwari constituency , one of the two constituencies he had contested. Taking a cue from late former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, Siddaramaiah unvieled a string of welfare schemes, many of their names suffixed with the word Bhagya (fortune or luck in Kannada) in a bid to appease the Ahinda vote bank but they failed to fetch him votes as desired.Apart from caste calculations, the party was heavily banking on Siddaramaiah governments performance. Its campaign too focused on projecting the government as one that fulfilled promises made during 2013 polls with the slogan, Nudidante Nadediddeve (We have walked the talk).The Congress too projected its CM as a symbol of regional pride and one who implemented a number of social welfare initiatives such as Anna Bhagya and Krishi Bhagya among others. The party hoped that the strategy would help it retain power in the state,.A state-wide survey conducted by the Association for Democratic Reforms and Daksh ahead of the polls revealed that the Anna Bhagya Scheme launched in the first year of the Siddaramaiah government which promises up to 30 kg of rice to each family below poverty level (BPL) at Re 1 per kg had a largely favourable response from residents of the state. Similarly, Krishi Bhagya scheme, which aims at efficient management of rainwater to improve agriculture productivity, was also received largely positively by the states farmers, the study added.The findings of a report from Ernst & Young also indicated Anna Bhagya and Ksheera Bhagya were very popular among the poor and could benefit Congress. The results proved otherwise.The only solace for Congress was the much-hyped Indira Canteens in Bengaluru as the party managed to win 13 of the 26 seats that went to the polls in the state capital."

And that nothing, not even a strong faction in the state BJP working against him, can stop him. The former RSS pracharak has his community to thank and complete backing from PM Modi.Born into an agricultural family in Bookankere in Mandya district on February 29, 1943, Yeddyurappa did his graduation and served for a short period in government service before shifting in 1965 to Shikaripur where he worked as a clerk in a rice mill. He went on to marry the mill owners daughter, Mytradevi, in 1967.Yeddyurappas political journey began with his election to the assembly from Shikaripur on a BJP ticket in 1983. He has won every election from the segment barring once. Though a leading light in BJP, Yeddyurappa had to wait for decades before aspiring for anything near the CMs gaddi.Though BJP under him emerged as the largest party in 2004 assembly elections, Congress and JD(S) cobbled a coalition, driving him to despair. Yeddyurappa was said to have toyed with the idea of splitting BJP in those days. Better sense prevailed and he stayed back in the party and soon entered into a deal with JD(S) and became CM in 2008.Though he lasted only seven days, Yeddyurappa became CM in the elections that ensued, riding a sympathy wave among Lingayats. However, his tenure was rocked by scams and ended with him quitting and getting arrested. After a brief period in the wilderness when he quit BJP and floated his own party, Yeddyurappa was back in BJP for the 2014 LS elections as its mascot.With 2018 further vindicating his claims of being the undisupted leader of the Lingyats, Yeddyurappa appears to have written himself into the partys script for the future.His successors, sons Vijayendra and Raghavendra, are waiting in the wings to take over the reins but BSY if he survives the trust vote  will be the leader who will call the shots in Karnataka for some time to come."

From millet pastas and almond-flour pizza bases to flaxseed wraps and chia seed crackers, fast food is getting a healthy twist.For some, traditional rice varieties and millets are a key ingredient. At Ammirdham Traditional Foods, N Ramesh Kumar and his wife R Rajalakshmi offer ready-to-cook pastas made from semolina (replacing maida) and different types of millets like foxtail, pearl and finger varieties. Some of their pastas are made from traditional rice varieties like maapillai samba and black wild rice.It was the need to eat healthy at home that got the couple to experiment with these highly nutritional grains. These grains were consumed by our ancestors for specific health benefits, says Kumar. ""The maapillai samba rice, used to be given to brides and bridegrooms before marriage. It is good for the heart, strengthens the nerves and has low glycemic index (GI), making it ideal for diabetics. The black wild rice is rich in anti-oxidants and iron,"" says Kumar, adding that with no preservatives, additives or colourants they are all high in fibre unlike maida, which can cause constipation.The healthy alternatives are particularly effective for diabetics and health-conscious individuals. So when Deepa Ramaprasad chanced upon a WhatsApp message about healthy, gluten-free pizzas, she was instantly tempted to try it out. The homemade pizza with almond flour base allowed her the indulgence she had been staving off.""We found that there was a demand for such healthier alternatives and after a year of research and development, we launched it in the market,"" says city-based Ramitha PR, who co-founded at5pizza with her husband, Aditya P in February.Almond flour is gluten-free, low in carbohydrates and high in protein, fibre and fat. It is more suitable for diabetics as it has a low GI compared to maida whose high GI is known to spike blood glucose levels. ""Pizzas from almond flour are filling, less chewy and doughy than maida equivalents,"" says Ramaprasad, who ordered from at5pizza.The growing awareness about healthy eating has led to many people making conscious choices. ""I began experimenting with products from almond flour after I received requests from my customers. The demand grew when nutritionists began referring clients to us,"" says Piece of Cake founder Shalini Padmanabhan, adding that she customised the recipe to suit the local palette.Padmanabhan offers a variety of items on request including almond flour buns, burgers and muffins, flaxseed wraps and chia seed crackers. The recipes have substitutes such as a paneer patty in a burger instead of potato. The lasagna has almond milk and cream with the pasta sheets (usually made of refined flour) replaced by layers of zucchini or aubergine.While it is encouraging to find a healthy avatar of sinful foods, nutritionists recommend these items be had in moderation. For instance, the number of almonds used in the flour may exceed the amount advised for daily consumption. ""Anything in excess is not good. One must be conscious about how frequently and how much they consume, keeping in mind the calorie count,"" says consultant dietician Dr Dharini Krishnan, adding that ingredients such as cheese can disturb the balance.(The author is a freelancer)"

Its over 40 years since his classic, The Remembered Village  a study of a village in Mysuru district  was first published Jayanth.Kodkani@timesgroup.comA few days after Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on January 30, 1948, sociologist M N Srinivas visited Kodagahalli in Mysore district to start field work for a study on the social structure of the village. To his surprise, the residents asked him to come back after the thirteenth day of mourning. The young Srinivas wondered whether the villagers were putting him off, but then he learnt that they were only trying to persuade him to start his project after the commemoration of the leaders death.Srinivas came later, with a cook and 26 pieces of luggage, stayed for 11 months to accustom himself with its social set-up and cultural tradition. He made a few more visits thereafter and finally in 1978, published a monograph of the village, titled The Remembered Village  considered an all-time classic in ethnography. Kodagahalli, situated about 34 km from Mysuru city, is indeed Rampura of the book. Many names of people and places in the book arent real ones.Of Rampura, Srinivas had heard that it was a multicaste unit, progressive and free from factional politics. But as he was to discover, these qualities had only relative merit. He was to point out the importance of caste loyalties in electoral politics, apart from the influence of dominant caste groups. It was while explaining the idea of such patronage that Srinivas coined the term vote bank, now used in a much wider context.Yet, the secret ballot allowed other choices. Soon after Independence, the Dalits were also becoming an organized unit. An official among them, who was not popular with the Vokkaligas and other major groups, contested the 1952 assembly election as a Praja Socialist Party candidate. The headman, Srinivas writes, backed another Dalit who was a Congress candidate, and even ferried voters to the polling booth. But the headman was startled to note that the official had won the election.Kodagahalli today is still described as relatively progressive and disciplined. In its demography, the past and present seem to be umbilical to each other: it still has over a dozen caste groups with the Vokkaligas in greater number, apart from 18 Muslim families; the Dalit houses are in a separate cluster. The population, though, has grown from 1,523 when Srinivas stayed here to over 5,000 in 800 homes. About 2,400 voters decide the fate of political candidates. The panchayat now comprises seven members, including three neighbouring villages in its ambit.There has been no history of any major caste or communal clash here, says former panchayat head Chikka Javaregowda (80). The police often say they dont have much to do because we settle minor disputes ourselves. A family might even consult an elderly Muslim for advice about a marriage alliance they haveJavaregowda was a 10 year old when Srinivas was engaged in his field work. I used to accompany him everywhere and so we developed a special bond. Hed mingle with all... But he was a sharp observer. At the headmans house, he had noticed how people of different castes behaved when they stepped on to the verandah. The priest who had access to the inner rooms would leave his footwear just outside the entrance, some others would leave their pairs almost on the street, far away.Much has changed in terms of facilities. And so, Javaregowdas narration of the story follows two routes: one of progress and one of nostalgia. The peepul tree at the mouth of the village where people waited for buses or met for a late afternoon chat, is now gone but the orchards behind the Bullock House where Srinivas was put up, stays in some form. Paddy was the main and sole crop then and the special Kodagahalli rice variety was our pride.He is also delighted to recall the day, many years ago, when 33 residents of the village went on an invitation to the Infosys campus in Bengaluru to attend a conference. (Narayana) Murthy played the perfect host and the event stretched on till evening. I spoke about the need to expand horizons and travel places, learn languages, recalls Javaregowda. Referring to the book, Murthy even asked me in good humour whether some people still walked with a swagger. I told him, you come and see for yourself.If anything, Kodagahallli is a hospitable village.

Together, they may prove to be a political masterstroke ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly elections. They could have a similar impact to the BJD governments decision to give rice at Re 1 per kg rice ahead of the 2014 elections.The main problem for the landless farmers, who take land on rent from land owners and cultivate as sharecroppers, is to get bank loans. Since banks insist on land rights documents to give farm loans, sharecroppers have to depend on land owners who avail loans and sublet them or private moneylenders, thereby increasing the chance of exploitation.Cooperation minister Surya Narayan Patro said the government would facilitate loans thorough joint liability groups comprising at least five sharecroppers, who can avail Rs 50,000 in loan from primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS) at one per cent interest. The government has a target to distribute Rs 200 crore to 1.35 lakh farmers in the coming kharif season. A government official said the move would also help sharecroppers avail insurance cover on the crops, which otherwise is availed by the land owner.For slum dwellers, the biggest problem so far used to be a place to stay in urban centres. Though the cities are dependent on them for various work, they are seen as encroachers. By providing land rights to them on encroached land, the government has removed fear of getting evicted. Under the Odisha Land Rights to Slum Dwellers Act, 2017, the government would be providing them land to build houses and rehabilitate them.On Monday, Naveen gave land rights certificates to 2,000 slum dwellers and promised to develop modern urban homes complete with streetlights, roads, community halls, parks and playgrounds for them. The government has announced to extend the benefits to 10 lakh slum dwellers living in 2,500 slums across the state in a year.Political analysts feel the twin initiatives, if implemented properly, may help the BJD consolidate its position among both the urban and rural poor electorates. The schemes come a bit late with only a few months left for the next elections. But if the government manages to fulfil its promises, it will reap rich political dividends, said Jayant Mohapatra , a retired professor of political science in Berhampur University.Farmer leaders have mixed reactions about the benefits of the latest move for sharecroppers. While one farmer leader, Lingaraj , welcomed the move, Akshay Kumar, convener of Nava Nirman Krishak Sangathan, a farmers outfit, said it would result in sharecroppers living in the vicious cycle of debts. Instead, the government should give social security allowance to sharecroppers and marginal farmers, Kumar said. BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said the governments intention is not to help the needy farmers or urban poor. It is coming out with such initiatives after doing nothing for 18 years. But it lacks sincerity. Without giving legal sanction to sharecroppers through legislation, such shortcuts will only encourage siphoning of funds, Sharma said."

And the essential commodities would be issued to them only if the OPT matches with their details.The project would be implemented in the district on a pilot basis.

In reciprocation, the mosque representatives invite the temple custodians to its festival, which is held once in five years.The religious institutions have been following this custom for the past three generations. The inviting part is carried out ceremoniously where the custodians of the temple led by three velichappad (oracles) visit the mosque on the first Friday after Vishu. The elders of the Muslim community, led by Imam of the mosque, are entrusted with the responsibility to invite the Hindus to their festival.The four-day-long temple festival is usually held in May, and this year it is scheduled from May 9 to 12.""This has been followed from the times of our great grandfathers,"" said Sukumar Shetty, who is the present manju bhandari (senior-most person of the family of the custodians of the temple).The legend behind the custom is that when the deities of the temple travelled all the way to the land, crossing the sea, they first met the custodians of the mosque, who welcomed them wholeheartedly.It was decided then that they would meet everyday, and this should be known to the public for which they would ritualistically invite each other, he explained.It is also widely believed that whoever had tried to break this indelible bond between the two religious institutions had met with mysterious ends.""We are active participants of the temple festival. The temple authorities offer us a truckload of vegetables, ghee and rice during the mosque festival,"" said T S Sayyed, who has been representing the mosque at the temple festival for the past eight years.Also, the seniors from both the communities share a common platform built around a banyan tree in front of the main shrine during the festival days.

As the director of Indore Zoo , Dr Uttam Yadav , maintains, The animals need special treatment to battle the rising temperature. They are already away from their natural habitat where they use their instincts and natural topography to keep themselves cool. Indore is more of a concrete jungle, so it becomes imperative to create a cool environment for the animals during summer. Even birds, that are most susceptible to rising temperatures, are getting vitamin supplements to keep their energy levels high. In their natural process of life, birds migrate to colder places to maintain their body temperatures. But special care and artificial cooling becomes important for birds in captivity, shares ornithologist Mohammad Khaliq.In order to retain the body fluid levels, the zookeepers are making sure they feed the animals with various fruits. The diet during summers is full of juicy fruits like watermelons, cucumbers and mangoes. For birds we add essential vitamins to their regular feed in order to meet their nutritional requirements, explains Nihar Parulekar , zoo curator and educational officer. He adds that fruits and vegetables that have more water and vitamin content keep the digestive tract of the animals cool. The big cats too have been getting controlled portions of meat to keep them healthy through the summer. Some zoos in other parts of the country have been introducing curd rice for some animals to help with their digestion. When enquired about the same, Nihar informs, While curd has some real benefits to humans during this season, it is not a natural occurring food for the wild animals. Though the animals have been reared in captivity, it is not advisable to change their food habits.To maintain an optimum body temperature of the animals, cage keepers work tirelessly right from 8 am to 5 pm giving the bigger animals regular showers and putting out coolers and sprinklers for others. In the morning, cooling baths are given to the tigers (Lucky, Adam and Jamuna) and the elephants (Moti and Laxmi). The bears (Krishna, Prabha, Gajni and Chotu) like to splash around in their shelters where water barrels are kept, shares a cage keeper. Besides the regular baths, khus screens have been set up around all shelters which are regularly sprinkled with water throughout the day to keep the areas cool. Khus screens are natural coolers and also give out a pleasant dewy fragrance that reminds one of everything green. The bigger animals are provided with coolers in addition to all this, owing to their body size and fat percentage, shares Parulekar. Chimps and deer, on the other hand, get a green cover to imitate their natural habitat. The zoo authorities add more plants by March to their shelters for this.Besides regulating the diet and creating a cool environment, the zoo authorities also take adequate precautions in order to avoid any instances of heatstroke. Since these animals are residing in the heart of city, we make sure to take precautionary measures during peak summer. We add Oral Rehydration Solutions (ORS) in a prescribed quantity to their water bowls, to keep them sufficiently hydrated. Similarly, cage keepers give a report every three hours on the status of the animals. Reptiles are very vulnerable during the season and they are closely monitored. If any animal shows signs of suffering a heatstroke, it is immediately shifted to the zoo hospital and kept in an air-conditioned area for recuperation under supervision of certified vets, informs Yadav. Van Vihar National Park in Bhopal has spread out hessian cloth rugs in shelters and sprinkles have been installed for animals.- At Kolkatas Alipore Zoo, animals are being given a special diet of summer fruits, bananas, sugarcane leaves and curd rice to beat the heat.- Special water coolers and pools have been put in place for the animals to cool off at Vishakhapatnam Zoo.- Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad has set up special foggers, rain guns and exhaust fans in their nocturnal section to keep owls, mongoose and bats hydrated."

5b1b410c9855b76d57038a21,"Feeding Kolkata, one hungry mouth at a time",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/feeding-the-city-one-hungry-mouth-at-a-time/articleshow/64035954.cms,2018-05-05,"KOLKATA: Four friends sat down to hang out one evening in 2016, a couple of months before Durga Puja. The idea was to discuss a plan that one of them had, to bounce it off among the other three. Fortunately, they were very excited at the idea... and thus started their project to feed Kolkata.It started as one ATM to ladle out free food to the hungry. In a period of just nine months, its gone up to three ATMS. And, if things go according to plan, therell be two more before Puja this year.Together, the three Food ATMs, as the project is being lovingly called, feed at least 2,000 people each day. The first one came up on the EM Bypass at Uttarpanchanna Gram, the second opposite Ladies Park on CIT Road, and the third one inside Ramleela Maidan off Moulali. The fourth is supposed to come up at Bhowanipore, near Chakraberia, and then a fifth near the 8B bus stand at Jadavpur.Restaurateur Asif Ahmed and his three entrepreneur friends Prakash Nahata, Rahul Agarwal and Nirmal Bajaj decided to start their endeavour as a sort of experiment by connecting with clubs that organise Puja. With the first letters of their names they formed Pran, a group to fight for a hunger-free Kolkata. Almost every club cooks and feeds bhog on all four days of Puja. We requested them to cook some extra bhog, so that we could distribute it among pavement-dwellers, Ahmed says. We were able to convince 15 clubs, and they gave us immense quantities of food, which we were able to distribute among hungry pavement-dwellers. The gratitude and satisfaction we saw on those poor faces was the incentive that sowed the seeds of the Food ATM project.Ahmed first turned his attention towards the food that his restaurant was left with at the end of each day. At his Uttar Panchannagram outlet, he got his workers to cool, pack and refrigerate the food, so that it could be distributed. His friends got a real estate company to donate a specially designed refrigerator, kept outside his restaurant, packed with food. Twice a day, the food was distributed to the needy. We started on August 15, 2017 to emphasize the freedom factor. What is the value of freedom unless we are able to give freedom from hunger to everyone in the city? Ahmed says.Bengali New Years Day was celebrated on April 15 a little differently at the Ramleela Maidan. Members of the Entally Yuvak Brinda joined hands with Pran to start the citys third food ATM. A special room was built beside the park, where the refrigerator is kept stocked with food, water and cold drinks, to be distributed among the homeless twice each day. At least 10 restaurants in the vicinity have been sending their packed excess food to the food ATM. We just had to visit the restaurant owners and tell them about our intent, and they readily agreed. If the city restaurants stop wasting their leftover food and refrigerate it, we will be able to eradicate hunger completely, says Jami Siddique, the clubs secretary.Most restaurants have to throw away the food even after feeding their staff, as they do not have extra refrigeration facilities and also because they cannot serve it to customers the next day. They just needed an organised, hygienic and efficient collection and distribution system, which is why the idea of the food-ATM seemed so appealing to the donors. Once in a while, restaurants also give away cold drink bottles, which we gratefully accept, says Sujoy Banerjee, a member of the clubs Food ATM organising committee. Members are now going a step further and approaching households in the area, telling them not to waste food but to pack it up neatly and call a helpline number that the club has set up, so that it can be collected from their doorsteps. Even one small container of rice and a little dal or dry sabzi, which is what we are able to collect from most households, is enough lunch for a hungry mouth, Siddique says.You have to be present at Ramleela Maidan around 1pm or 9pm any given day to see how the distribution is done and to see how happily the recipients  especially the kids  are, leaving with the food packets. Khub bhalo khabar... we even get pieces of chicken, fish or eggs at times, says Monua Patra, a 70-year-old woman who comes with her grandchildren for the food every day. We share the food amongst us. God bless these good men, she says.Perhaps the most popular of all the food ATMs is the one opposite Ladies Park on CIT Road. At this ATM, we are not only getting food from restaurants, but also get excess food and cakes from birthday parties, wedding halls and party organisers, says Surjya Kanta Haldar, the points person for this ATM.This ATM is also getting a lot of donations from schoolchildren of Don Bosco Park Circus and Mahadevi Birla Girls HS School, who keep chocolate, juices and cakes on their birthdays. These happen quite often nowadays and we are able to happily distribute the goodies among the needy kids, Haldar says.Both in Bhowanipore and Jadavpur, Pran is in the last stages of discussion about starting the ATMs. The refrigerators come free from the real estate group in accordance with the agreement with Pran. The real challenge is that the club members need to network with local restaurants and in the neighbourhood to get a steady chain of donors, Ahmed adds.At each partner restaurant, efforts are on to educate patrons about the initiative so that after they have eaten what they need, they can ask waiters to pack up the leftovers. Needless to say, the idea has clicked."

But on Friday, most MMiCs and mayor Sovan Chatterjee opted for a strict vegetarian fare. The civic bosses could not seem to trust even reputable restaurants, which usually supplied delicacies to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation headquarters, owing to the scare about the quality of meat being sold after the carcass scam came to the fore.As food packets from a popular restaurant were served during Fridays MiC meeting, mayor Chatterjee took a peek into a veg sandwich but set it aside, suspecting some chicken pieces in it. Following in his footsteps, a couple of MMiCs, too, decided not to touch the sandwich. But veteran MMiC Ram Pyare Ram took a bite after carefully studying the sandwich and its content. A few other followed suit. But most othersMMiCs and senior officialschose the safe option of having veg-fried rice and chilli paneer. MMiC Atin Ghosh, who had just finished a raid on eateries at Alipore and Kidderpore, did not even touch the food packet. He had lassi instead. A KMC official conceded such a scare among the civic officials was unprecedented.During the inspection on eateries at Alipore and Kidderpore, Ghosh and his team collected 15 meat samples and destroyed large quantities for being either stale or the presence of spurious food colour in them. Food inspectors also collected samples from a restaurant inside Alipore zoo.But questions are being raised on the manner the Kolkata and Howrah municipal corporations have been conducting their drives against contaminated meat and destroying chicken and fish from restaurants on suspicion of being stale. The seized meats were sent to the Belgachia dumping ground. Howrah mayor Rathin Chakraborty claimed that the civic body had no space to keep those samples and so, had to destroy the entire amounts.Chakraborty also pointed out that they would install CCTV cameras at the dumping ground and tighten security there."

On a friends advice, I decided to follow a week-long crash diet without any experts consultation and it turned out to be a disaster for me, said Krati, who thereafter, vowed not to follow any other crash diet.Maintaining ideal weight is not a big deal, it doesnt require eliminating everything from the diet. It only requires a few changes. People who dont take advice make it look like a difficult task to accomplish. But, in reality, its just the opposite, said nutritionist Dr Sangeeta Malu Diabetes, hyper acidity, irritable bowel syndrome, blood pressure, weakness and loss of energy are a couple of issues that people will face in case of diets without consultation of the experts . Its a good thing to be fitness conscious, however, without the guidance of an expert it can be harmful for the person, said dietician Dr Preeti Shukla According to Preeti, the Indian diet is the most balanced one. We start opting for shortcut like eating only rice and dal or chapatti and vegetables and thats where we lose. If we start skipping some elements of our food, then it will definitely lead to multiple medical issues, added Shukla.There are several crash diets- seven days, ketone, juice crash, Hollywood and master cleanse- which have been followed by many people. But, these diets are designed and are tailor-made to the individual based on the work profile, medical history, and climatic conditions, said the experts who strongly believe that before starting any kind of diet, the person should definitely opt for an expert advice.A fashion designer Sheena Kumar, who followed a three-day all liquid diet had to be taken to a doctor on the third day due to excessive weakness and giddiness. I had a bet with my cousin to complete this diet. I wanted to lose some weight as well, so I gave in. But, instead of weight loss, I had to go through some medication in the end, she said.As per dietician Dr Swati Sharma Parmar, dieting without the advice of a qualified dietician/nutritionist can lead to malnutrition and many major deficiencies. During some diet people leave the major component of food, i.e carbohydrate. One should restrict the amount of intake but shouldnt eliminate it completely, added Parmar."

As per request by UP PCCF (wildlife) SK Upadhyay, our field formations have been coordinating with the convoy throughout the tour. We got water tankers at Fetri and water melons to avoid dehydration to animals, said Bhatkar.The convoy started on April 29 from Karnataka with four elephants from Shimoga and seven from Mysore. It took four days to reach Nagpur passing through Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. It will take another week to reach Dudhwa, says Koujalagi.As there is no shade in Gorewada, we took shelter under trees near Fetri. It is a tough exercise. We bagged the contract to shift the animals. So far, we have shifted 50 odd elephants to places in MP, West Bengal and Uttarakhand, said Mohammed Rafi, the transporter.Our biggest problem is not feeding elephants or transporting them but food for around 30 men from Karnataka, who want rice and in Maharashtra and MP, roti-sabji is the staple diet, adds Rafi. Breakfast for all costs around Rs8,000, lunch and dinner even more.This is a classic example of interstate coordination. We have failed to shift elephants from Gadchiroli to Pench to create a permanent rescue unit but UP is transporting elephants all the way from Karnataka by spending lakhs of rupees, said local wildlife lovers."

Thanks to a bevy of apps, one can get food of their choice delivered to their doorstep in no time, that too only for a nominal delivery fee.Cashing in on a rising trend of gastronomes preferring to order their food and eat in peace at home instead of taking the trouble to go out to a restaurant, these food delivery apps go the extra mile to ensure that food is delivered piping hot (or ice cold) from a wide range of restaurants in the city, starting from early morning till late night.Apps like US-based Uber Eats, city-based Night Out Chef, Food Mingo, Meal On Call, Orderwala and Vizag Dabbawala are enjoying a tremendous response from foodies in the city.The biggest USP of these food delivery apps is the ease with which you can order food at your doorstep. Tourists visiting the city also find it a boon to order from their hotel. Another advantage is being able to order food when one is not in the mood to cook.Bhavik Rathod, head (India) of Uber Eats, said, Vizag has been popularised with recent awards like the Swachh City tag. This attracts tourists from across the globe. All these factors play to our advantage. We have tied up with 150 restaurants including the famous Sairam Parlour in the city.T Satyannrayana, proprietor of Sai Ram Parlour, a popular restaurant in the city, said the online or app-based food service would be a boon for many restaurants in the city. The restaurants too stand to thrive through these food delivery apps as they can now reach out to a wider consumer base.Dinesh Kumar, CEO of a Vizag start-up called Night Out Chef, said people are quickly adapting to the apps. People are now embracing the idea of ordering food through apps. It eliminates the time wasted in traffic, as well as the time spent in waiting at hotels. We deliver our service for a charge of just Rs 1. We serve up to 2AM. We get 18-20 orders daily, he said.V Priyanka, who ordered food through Uber Eats on Wednesday told TOI that she ordered food from A1 Restaurant in Dwarakanagar at around 2.15pm. I was surprised to see that the food arrived at my doorstep within 20minutes. I didnt have to step out for food in this hot weather, Priyanka said.Some popular dishes in Vizag are Pela Vadiyalu (puffed rice and tapioca), Teepi Avakaya (spicy mango pickle), Mandugula (Halwa), Chepala Pulusu (fish in tangy, spiced tamarind sauce), Bongulo Chicken (Bamboo chicken), Bobbatlu and Punugulu."

But fluttering BJP flags, two life-size cutouts of party leaders Amit Shah and B Sreeramulu, and a fleet of SUVs are a giveaway that the farmhouse is where mining baron G Janardhana Reddy has pitched camp.Not allowed to enter his home turf Ballari by the Supreme Court, and with the BJP leadership's public proclamation that he is to keep off party campaigning, Janardhana is working out of the farmhouse, masterminding the election campaign of associate Sreeramulu, who is the BJP candidate from Molakalmuru constituency.The farmhouse is owned by NP Venkatesh, 57, who insists that he be addressed as 'Dr Venkatesh' as he has obtained a doctorate from his Valmiki community's dharma peetha.Venkatesh takes pride in dropping names of top politicians, including Siddaramaiah , Mallikarjun M Kharge, M Veerappa Moily , late N Dharam Singh and late S Bangarappa, who have stayed in his farmhouse en route Bengaluru to Ballari.The five-bedroom farmhouse has been let out to Reddy. A 10-member crew is busy through the day, preparing tea, avalakki, rice and sambar for the endless stream of visitors who come to meet Reddy.Once cleared by a strategic surveillance unit stationed outside the farmhouse, the visitors help themselves to food as they wait for Reddy.Venkatesh, who is into the paddy trade, and his wife P Sharadamma, a doctor at Molakalmuru's government hospital, said that prior to the announcement of polls, Reddy's people had approached him with an offer to buy the house, but he had declined. ""I was hesitant to even let it out, but my wife convinced me, saying all political parties come to our house and Reddy is in distress,"" he added.He was also asked to quote his price for letting out the house. ""I told Reddy to give me Rs 101 after the election, which I will donate to a temple in Kolhapur. My wife has moved to Bengaluru to stay with our son, who is doing his MBA, and I have taken up a room nearby. There are two well-furnished bedrooms on the first floor,"" Venkatesh said.Besides the bedrooms, the first floor has a dining room, a sprawling terrace with a treadmill and a view of the highway.Venkatesh claims a lot of sweat and toil has gone into the farmhouse, which he constructed after his wife constantly taunted him. ""We used to live in a shed, and over dinner every night, my wife would always remind me that we did not have a house. I told her I would construct a palace for her. That's how Sharadamma farmhouse came up. It cost Rs 68 lakh six years ago,'' he says.Asked about the source of money, Venkatesh becomes emotional and says the house was built from their hard earned money."

The couple resided in Birwadi village in Shahapur taluka of Thane district.According to the police, Santosh doubted Sunita as she would be on the phone for long. The couple would often fight over the issue.On Monday night, when Sunita was returning from the rice mill, Santosh accosted her and took her to an isolated spot.

On one hand, there is no fear of law among people who litter streets with impunity and on the other, there was no motivation either as in the absence of adequate garbage bins and cleaning exercise, people had no option but to dump waste on roads. However, there are also examples where people took care to clean up after bhandaras, conveying the message that keeping the city clean is as sacred as celebrating the festival.LUCKNOW: With Bada Mangal beginning from Tuesday, Lucknows streets were full of kiosks offering prasad of poori-sabzi, rice and dal and sharbat to anyone who stopped by.However, the lack of a waste management system and poor planning on the part of Lucknow Municipal Corporation led to littering on streets.Despite framing strict rules to impose user charges on organisers for waste collection this year, LMC failed to collect the charge from even a single organiser.Moreover, it was also mandated that all organisers would take permission from LMC before setting up stalls so that its sanitary staff could coordinate with the organisers to collect waste.On the first Bada Mangal, however, none of the stalls was registered with LMC. According to its estimate, more than 1,500 big and small prasad stalls were set up. From main roads to bylanes, they were spread across the city but none had approached LMC for prior approval.LMC had announced it would charge organisers Rs 100 for water and drinks, Rs 200 for boondi and light prasad while Rs 500 for food distribution.Environment engineer Pankaj Bhusan said, Tuesday was an off day because of Labour Day and LMC could not enforce the user charge or penalty on stalls. Besides, religious sentiments are attached with Bada Mangal and LMC couldnt take strict measures on the first day.LMC had also announced that under the norms of National Green Tribunal , it was liable to impose penalties ranging from Rs 5,000 to 50,000 on offenders. It had said it would penalise those found dumping garbage on roads and in the open.However, despite most stall organisers flouting norms, LMC was unable to impose neither user charges nor a fine on anyone.As a result, widespread littering was witnessed on almost every street and crossing. The number of dustbins was dismally low.In places such as Aliganj, Bhootnath, Vikasnagar, Alambagh and Chowk, piles of paper plates, disposable glasses and food waste were seen on roadsides. Only at a few places such as Indirangar, LDA Colony and Sarojininagar were dustbins found but even those were brimming with garbage by afternoon.Neither LMC nor any organiser had made arrangements for regular cleaning of dustbins. As a result, waste was spilling onto the roads, littering the surroundings and serving as feed for stray animals.Only a few places had proper arrangements for waste dumping. Stalls between Patrakarpuram and Husadia crossing had sufficient provision for dustbins and cleaning of roads. The organisers were also seen requesting people to throw plastic plates and glasses only in dustbins.Pappoo Singh, an organiser in Gomtinagar, said, LMC should have created enough awareness about imposing user charge for bhandaras in advance. We dont know even today about the charges and how LMC will take care of regular cleaning and waste collection during bhandaras."

An NGO has offered the services free of cost only charging for fitting of electronic chips at existing market rates. The NGO will affix an electronic chip inside the hide of dogs. MC will soon call for the expressions of interest from the prospective companies which can fulfill the guidelines. At present, the civic body has no clue about the population of canines roaming around freely in streets. Moreover, the MC also failed to reveal the records of pet dogs and registrations which were issued to the pet owners in city.However, the sanitation department officials have estimated the count to be around 4,500- 5,000. Kuwlant Singh, the city mayor, said, ""An NGO has offered to give free services for stray dog sterilization, rabies vaccination and conducting the census of the stray dogs in city. The NGO will charge only for fitting an electronic chip in stray dog caught on the lines of prevalent market rates. We will soon call for the expression of interests for the same.Meanwhile, work extension has been given to the existing company to carry out the sterilization process for six months."" Mayor further stated that the stray dogs within the Mohali MC limits will have a unique identification number embedded on a microchip installed under their skin. ""This process will create a databank on the number of stray and pet dogs in city,"" he added. The NGO claims that it will fix a chip which will contain complete information about the animal and will also be helpful in conducting zone-wise census of the dogs. Revealing the salient features of the chip, Nilesh, the NGO representative said, ""The digital identification criterion will replace the conventional cumbersome procedure of granting licenses for pets. The chip implant is an integrated circuit placed under the skin of the animal. It will allow officials to maintain complete information about the dog including age, vaccination details, owner's name and address.""He further told that the chip would be about the size of a rice grain with a 14-digit number which will employ passive radio frequency identification technology to identify the animal. ""It will be injected under the neck of the animal which will be similar to administering an injection,"" he expressed. Mohali MC is also mulling over the plans to increase floor area of the stray dog and cattle pound by augmenting 2 acres of land to the existing facility. A plan has been prepared after identifying the land which was forwarded to local bodies department for approval. GMADA had also given consent for allotting the land near existing dog sterilization centre subject to approval of the local bodies department."

I think we will get about 100 seats and some independent MLAs will be there. If not, we will sit in the opposition, or go for fresh elections. I have made a lot of promises to the people, I will not be able to fulfil them if I join hands with Congress or BJP. If I go for fresh elections, I will benefit the most as the people will empathise with me.In about 100 seats, I am fighting Congress directly. It is a triangular fight in North Karnataka in about 60 constituencies, the rest is Congress-BJP, JDS-BJP or Congress-JDS. I have learnt from earlier elections. I have concentrated only on about 150 to 160 seats rather than on all 224. That will pay dividends this time.We had a bitter experience forming governments with both Congress and BJP(in 2004 and 2006). At that time, BJP got power for the first time because of me. So, compared to Congress, they worked with us comfortably, with gratitude. Now, the situation is different. We cant depend on BJP Within two months of sharing power with BJP, they charged against me through this MLC that I collected Rs 150 crore from the mining business. Then one minister complaint in the police station that I have given supari to kill him. They have grown in Karnataka and become financially strong because of my support. Now they behave just like Congress.It is crucial, even for 2019. For all parties, national parties also. If we get clear majority on our own with BSP, I think, in a major way, political turmoil will happen. Several times earlier central politics have changed from Karnataka. Even (former PM) V P Singh ultimately succeeded because of Karnataka.The tie-up is going to bring us 2-3% extra votes. Chief minister Siddaramaiah tried to destabilise original Congress leaders from the Dalit community. They are nowhere in the picture now, whether it is Mallikarjun Kharge, G Parameshwara or Srinivas Prasad, all of whom are Dalit icons. It will certainly help our party get a big chunk of Dalit votes. BSP has a base of 1,000-2,000 votes in several constituencies. I lost 38 constituencies (in 2013) with a margin of 300-3,000 votes.He gives a relaxation of Rs 85 for four people in the free rice scheme (Anna Bhagya), but he is extracting Rs 1,500 from the same people who are depending on it. A quarter bottle of liquor costs Rs 15 to manufacture, but his excise department puts taxes and the price is Rs 75-80 per bottle.A minimum of Rs 50 profit per bottle. The people who use this rice pay the price for these bottles. I will change it. When I was CM, I banned arrack. I have, however, studied his programmes and pro-people ones of Telangana, Israel, Thailand. I will give better programmes. I am speaking to the people in questions and answers in all my programmes and working things out."

Raj Kumar, alias Raju, was arrested on Monday while travelling in a bus in Fatehgarh Sahib and a .12-bore pistol, along with three cartridges, were seized from him.Police revealed that Raju, a murder convict, was wanted in nine cases registered against him in different police stations for his alleged involvement in snatchings, robberies, dacoities at gunpoint, kidnappings and murders. He had been declared a proclaimed offender (PO) for the last two years.He had killed Sandeep Singh , son of former Akali minister, in 2009 and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2012 in the case.

Unfettered, undeterred, a batter unbettered.Although supposedly of Kannada origin, the idli has in time become synonymous with the traditional breakfast and tiffin in Tamil Nadu. And the last decade has seen the idli in the news more than ever in the city. In June of 2008, the humble dish came into the spotlight when hotel owners in the state announced they were going to lower the price of food items  especially the most popular breakfast item  by 10% to 15% as a birthday gift to chief minister M Karunanidhi, who was turning 85.The celebrations brought with it angst as well, with restaurant owners bemoaning the spiraling costs of raw ingredients, several of them reducing manpower and quantities served to keep afloat. The cost of making a plate of idlis, said some owners at the time, had risen from `5 to `7.Around this time, the city also began opening up to international cuisine . Headlines such as Loving Tokyo and from Seoul to Saidapet, were common. Whether it was Thai, Mediterranean, Mexican, Italian or American, Chennai was home to it all. The city went beyond the Far East exploring cuisines from far eastern Europe as well. Polish, Russian, and now Armenian (in a few months) are all available a la carte. But the idli and dosa, recipes unchanged, continued to be all-time favourites.K Murali Rao, managing director of New Woodlands Hotel, says the idli-chutney at his restaurant is the only thing that has remained constant. ""The restaurant shifted premises, but our plate of idlis has not changed in terms of recipe since 1933. Why change something thats has been our best-seller for decades,"" he asks.In 2013, the idli picked up steam like never before, when chief minister J Jayalalithaa launched Amma Unavagam, where municipal corporations of the state-run canteens serving subsidised food at low prices. The chain of Amma canteens that spread across the state, sold everything from rice dishes to chapatis. But it was the steamed rice cakes  priced at `1 each  that sold like hot cakes. Its been five years since the launch, and the idlis continue to be priced at `1, while sales are skyrocketing. In the year of launch, according to data from the Chennai corporation, around 2.5 lakh idlis were sold per day, hitting a high of 7.8 crore idlis in 2013. The average number of idlis sold per day has now risen to 2.7 lakh, while the total number of idlis sold since the launch being 50.7 crore.And then, in 2014, the idli got an edge. Literally. High flying corporate executive R U Srinivas decided to go FMCG with the idli, changing its shape from sphere to rectangle, which he felt would elevate it into a whole new world. His Mylapore-based Idli Factory markets just one thing  the idli-molaga podi combo  and according to Srinivas, the business has grown 25 times in four years, with him selling 1.2 lakh, of his no preservatives packaged idlis, a month off the shelf. The bar-shaped idli, he says, was more about convenience in terms of eating than about novelty, although it has now become their USP.

Four persons in the vehicle, two of them on the loading deck, were injured when they were thrown off. The spilled oil turned the road slippery, forcing traffic to be suspended for more than three hours.The incident happened around 10pm when the truck was heading towards a Kidderpore market from the Burrabazar area.In order to check vehicles from over speeding  especially at night when there are fewer policemen on the road  Kolkata Police places guardrails with wheels next to each other, but not parallel. Vehicles have to slow down and turn cautiously to pass through the gap without hitting the structures.This particular truck, however, was speeding and while attempting to turn through the small gap between the guardrails  about 10m  the driver lost control and the truck fell on its left, said an officer of Maidan police station.Police took the four injured persons  Swapan Chandra Bag , 40, Debasish Pattanaik, 42, Biswanath Betal , 42, and driver Sarman Ram , 50  to SSKM Hospital with injuries on the head, limbs and face.But none was critically hurt and were discharged on Friday, an officer said.When the truck fell, tins carrying mustard oil leaked and spilled over on the road. The oil mixed with diesel and engine oil trickling from the vehicle and turned the area into a mess and many rescuers slipped while trying to help the victims.The area had become so slippery, that it was impossible for vehicles to ply on the road. A crane was brought in, but even that could not operate because of the road surface was too oily, said the officer.The cops then suspended traffic on that portion of the road. They sprayed water on the road and then sprinkled sand on the road surface to reduce the grease. Finally, after over three hours, cops managed to pull up the truck and tow it away. Normal traffic movement along the road started only after the surface was declared fit for vehicular movement."

I used to give the rent to a person who approached me. I dont know who he is and where he is from, he said.Vignesh Sharma, son of the temple priest, said the shops were constructed after getting consent from HR&CE officials. Asked about the consent letter obtained from the department, he said he did not have it.When contacted by TOI, executive officer of the temple P Rajarathinam said he did not know about the illegal construction. The HR&CE was receiving Rs 665 as rent from the shop owner. My predecessors allowed the construction and I do not know whether it is illegal or not, he said.

Indigenous varieties could withstand climate change and required little or no manure. But that was before many farmers were tricked into believing that genetically modified (GM) seeds sold by private companies would ensure better yield.Chinna Durva of Todsa village remembers indigenous varieties like Gadel, Pitris, Dubraj, Badge, Sudi among others sowed in the farm of his father and grandfather. There was no question of buying seeds from outside. The crops could survive on little or no water, and did note require even spraying, he says.Farming became unaffordable after he fell into the trap of buying hybrid seeds from the market, followed by use of pesticides and other crop requirements.About four years ago, Durva was helped with 2kg of pure Gadel and 1kg of pure Pitris seeds by the BAIF Foundation, out of which he not only produced 700 and 500kg of seeds respectively, but also increased his farms yield by adopting organic farming methods.Sanjay Patil, thematic programme executive, BAIF, says even today, some of the madia and gond tribals have indigenous genetic resources. We have identified 57 genotypes of rice and have made a database of the traditional knowledge the tribals have about the varieties, and have used it with agronomics in order to increase yield and later market the produce. We have also made nurseries of non-timber forest produce such as Mohua, Hirda and Jambul, he says.Known as the Maharashtra Gene Bank project (MGBP), this crop biodiversity programme is spread over 15 villages of Etapalli Block in Gadchiroli, covering nearly 400 families. Started in 2014, priority crops covered in this area are paddy and hyacinth bean.Selecting villages and conducting participatory survey are the initial steps in this community-led seed conservation programme. Next, seed sample collected from seed savers are preserved in a central seed bank at cluster level. Purifying seeds and establishing community seed bank is the motive of the endeavour.Apart from Gadchiroli, this programme is also being carried out in Palghar, Nandurbar, Ahmednagar, and Pune districts. In all, 54 villages in the state are a part of this initiative. Priority crops in other areas also include paddy, millet, maize, cow pea, sorghum, wild vegetables and tuber crops.Started by BAIF Institute for Sustainable Livelihood and Development (BISLD), the project focuses on participatory in situ (conservation of species in their natural surroundings) and ex-situ conservation, management and revival of local resources. This initiative involves not only crop landraces, but also livestock types, forest species, and habitat types in select clusters and diverse agro-climatic zones of Maharashtra.The project is being supported by Rajiv Gandhi Science and Technology Commission and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research."

Besides, the field staff of the agency fears being heckled.The FCI has demanded security for its field staff in at least seven of the 21 purchase centres in Bathinda district. The FCI has a storage capacity of 11.7 lakh tonnes and nearly 13 lakh tonnes rice is already stored in its godowns in both Bathinda and Mansa districts. Slow pace of movement of rice to other states through the railway network is increasing problems of the FCI. In some of the purchase centres, the FCI has decided to make purchases only if the rakes are provided by the railways to transport wheat directly out of Punjab without keeping the grains in its godowns, which were filled beyond capacity.Sources said that it was after six years that the FCI was facing space shortage as against the normal movement of 1,000 rakes of rice in a month, only 200-250 rakes were moving out of Punjab for the last three months. One rake of 42 wagons in a goods train carries 2,600 tonnes of rice and in a rake of 58 wagons 3,500 tonnes of rice are transported. The FCI wants protection for its purchase staff at purchase centres of Chathewala, Lelewala, Natheha, Teona Pujaria, Fallad and Kalalwala in Maur and Rama Mandi areas of Bathinda. The FCI has a target to procure 1.80 lakh tonnes of wheat in Bathinda and Mansa distrcts.The FCIs procurement manager in Bathinda, Chakkerpani Siddarth, told TOI, Due to space constraints the agency is forced not to make purchases. We have taken up the matter with our higher authorities and the railways to provide special rakes so that we could make purchases and send wheat grains directly out of Punjab through trains. He admitted that failure to make purchases was leading to anger among farmers and due to that their field staff was afraid of going to the grain markets and were demanding protection. He said that some farmers had held some FCI purchase officials captive at Chathewala a couple of days ago, which had scared the agency staff.Bathinda ADC Sakshi Sawheny confirmed that the FCI was facing storage space shortage . We have taken up the matter for special trains to transport the grains. The FCI staff has not gone to the grain markets so far. I held meeting with them on Wednesday as we want them to start procurement at the earliest. The administration is ready to provide the logistics and protection if needed. So far, the FCI officials have not given in writing for seeking protection."

In Ahmedabad, community members visit temples or Gurudwara and prepare halwa at home. The traditional langar feast is also offered at Gurudwara, which is accompanied by community gatherings, said Vivek Dhiman, a resident of Bopal.Assamese, too, celebrated Rongali Bihu, greeting the new year with feasts and festivities. Manoj Borah, resident of Prahladnagar, said, Bihu is the harvest festival and the one on Sunday is Rongali Bihu, which is marked as the New Year. We adorn ourselves in new clothes, offer prayers and also prepare traditional delicacies including pitha, Jalpan (sticky/ flattened rice with curd and jaggery), and a variety of vegetables, among others. What I miss the most is the sense of belonging as here everyone celebrates alone and there is hardly any community gathering.Vishu is observed on the first day of Medam month after the solar cycle of the luni-solar Hindu calendar and the celebrations are often done locally yet with elaborate preparations. A thaali is prepared and the day begins by looking at the thaali and offering prayers. The day is spent meeting and greeting loved ones, said K M Ramachandran, of Ahmedabad Kerala Samajam.The Bengali community has organized a gathering to bring in local cultural flavours from Bengal. Weve organized a cultural programme where dance performances on Rabindra Sangeet will be organized by members. That apart, a community dinner with traditional Bengali delicacies including Radha Vallabhi, Baigan Bhaja, Roshogulla, among others will be there, said K S Adhikari of Bengal Cultural Association.Food and traditional delicacies are an integral part of any New Year celebration. Weve been staying in Gujarat for years, and while there are hardly any traditional rituals we follow, mother usually offers prayers her way and prepares some lip-smacking traditional dishes such as Pachadi (a dip) and Payasam (rice pudding), which we look forward to and relish with delight.

Soon, the transport department will notify guidelines for grant of permit to tractor-trailers and their registration. The new transportation rates for lifting of food grains had yielded annual savings of Rs 150 crore, claimed the government spokesperson, alleging that the previous government caused losses of Rs 1,250 crore on this account.There is no legal bar on the use of tractor-trailers as goods transport vehicles, but as per the 1992 notification of the Union transport ministry, tractor-trolley owners have to register their transport if they intend to use transport commercially.Punjab transport department has decided to authorise regional transport authorities in sub-divisions and SDO (civil)-cum-SDM in rest of the sub-divisions to grant permit to tractor-trailers for the limited purpose of carrying food grains from a mandi yard or purchase centre to a delivery point not farther than 25 km. Beyond this, a maximum of 12 km can be on a state highway or national highway, mentioned on the permit. The grain delivery point would be a godown, a plinth, a warehouse, a silo, a rice mill or railway siding.The government has also considered that since tractor-trolleys have been lying idle after the harvest, its decision to allow their use for transporting of food grains will not only help support the procurement process but also generate additional income for the owner. The department has also decided that trolleys need not be called to the office for registration and registration certificates and permits may be issued on the spot in camp mode. The transport department notification will also lay down specifications for obtaining fitness certificates to enable such use of the tractor-trailers."

As per Section 30A of the Tea Act 1953, the government can fix the minimum as well as the maximum price for green leaf, and also for made-tea , newly-elected vice-chairman of the Tea Board of India , B Kumaran  a native of the Nilgiris  told TOI.The Act has all the provisions to safeguard the small tea growers and other parties involved in the manufacturing of made-tea, he said. The Act protects the interest of not only the small tea growers, but also the producers, exporters and even wholesalers, the official said.There are about 50,000 farmers cultivating tea in over one lakh acres of land in the hill district. While the cost of commodities have gone up by 20% in the last three decades, small tea growers in the Nilgiris fetch only a price between Rs 11 and Rs 15 per kg for green leaf since 1990.Asked why the tea board has been silent all these years about the demand of the small tea farmers, Kumaran said, Tea does not fall under the essential commodity category like sugar, rice or wheat. But, still the Act provides such a clause to ensure the farmers a good price. The tea board has to take serious steps so that the ministry concerned would fix a minimum price for green leaf provided in the act and get justice to the farmers.Stating that the tea marketing control (TMC) order has been amended recently to carry out the high court direction, the official pointed out that the district green leaf monitoring committee has been formed based on the amendment. The committee fixes monthly price for green leaf tea, in which 65% of the auctioned price of the made-tea goes to the farmers. Thus the direction of the court is being executed.But, still the farmers are not getting a fair cost price for the green leaf tea. Tea board has to take steps to bring about a permanent solution. Traders are the main people in the industry selling the product. In fact, there is a huge gap between the price fetched by the farmers and the price paid by the consumers. Neither the farmers nor the consumers are benefited. Only the traders are benefited. Hence, the board will soon take proper steps to eliminate the huge gap in pricing. For this, modalities have to be worked out. Obviously, all problems lie in the auctioning centres. While I cannot answer for the past actions, I can assure now that the board will take steps to fix a minimum price for made-tea sold at auction centres. That will solve most of the problems. The board will meet the commerce minister soon and insist upon this issue, Kumaran said.Talking about an alternative long-lasting solution, Kumaran said, Under the Make In India programme, we will request the defence ministry to set up state-of art tea manufacturing units, at least six, in the district. The made-tea would be absorbed by the ministry for a reasonable price. That would solve the problems of fair price for green leaf tea, job opportunities and also curtail migration of the natives."

When they move to big cities to seek treatment, they either end up living on footpaths or in shelter homes. On most days they go without three meals including the child with cancer.In the start, we were losing out 40 percent of children to abandonment of treatment because money received as donation is designated for chemotherapy and medicine, not food. Since they were malnourished, they couldnt assimilate chemotherapy and would suffer from seizures, toxicity, their gut lines would erode, explains the NGOs founder-trustee Purnota Dutta Bahl ,who has 30 nutritioniststrained under a paediatric oncology nutrition fellowship programon board, They not only prescribe customised diet plans but also redesign meals inventively during the chemotherapy phasewhen the kids taste and appetite are altered.

Its his love for adventure that gave him the courage to fight all odds to complete the treacherous journey, says Das.It turned out to be a life-changing moment for Das, when Indrani Chakraborty, a television producer from Naktala, hailed his rickshaw in 2014. During the short journey, she learnt that Das was planning to leave for Ladakh soon. He fished out old pictures of him visiting Puri and some places in north India on his rickshaw and showed it to her. At that moment, Indrani decided to shoot his journey to Ladakh and turn it into a film.I didnt have the money to follow Satyen Das on his entire journey to Ladakh, so taught him to shoot on a handycam. It was tough when the handycam stopped working after he crossed Benaras and someone from my team had to rush to where he was and get it repaired. Two of my associates and I met him on the final leg of his trip in Ladakh, says Indrani.Das credits Indrani for helping him in completing the journey and doesnt forget to thank some of his regular passengers and members of Naktala Agrani Sangha , a club in his neighbourhood.I drove my wife and daughter to Puri and north India and was inspired to take my rickshaw to Khardung La mountain pass, the worlds highest motorable road, 39 km Leh. I got help from Indranidi, a few of my passengers and members of Naktala Agrani Sangha. There were many challenges; every day, someone or the other would ask me to return to Kolkata. You can go till Srinagar, not beyond, they told me. But I didnt budge, recalls Das.For Das, food was as big an issue as the lack of oxygen and the inclement weather. I carried basic ingredients like rice and potatoes. I would either have aloo chokha-bhaat or instant noodles; it was more of a fight for survival, he says.But the toughest part of his journey came when he reached Zoji La pass. The roads were rough and there was no way that I could carry my belongings on the rickshaw and cover the 8-km stretch. I would offload everything on the road drive the rickshaw for a few metres and return to carry the things on my shoulder. It took an entire day to cross that stretch, but I didnt stop. I wanted to create a record of sorts by reaching Khardung La.Das, who shot his journey on a handycam, was joined by a three-member camera team in Ladakh. From thereon, there was no looking back. I returned to Ladakh again in 2017, this time with the message of fighting global warming. I sprinkled 5,000 date seeds along the way.His rickshaw has been put on display at the university campus set up by Sonam Wangchuk in Ladakh.

5b1b9d9d9855b76d5703a9cc,A million mutinies: Here is what's behind the Tamil angst,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-million-mutinies-here-is-whats-behind-the-tamil-angst/articleshow/63768318.cms,2018-04-15,"Ever since the Supreme Court-mandated deadline for setting up the Cauvery Management Board expired at the end of March, Tamil Nadu has been simmering. On Thursday, the anger boiled over during PM Narendra Modis visit to Chennai for the Defexpo. An army of vociferous protesters in black took over those areas of the city where the prime minister was supposed to touch down. They released bunches of black balloons into the sky and #ModiGoBack trended on Twitter.The rallying call for boycott may have been given by DMK working president MK Stalin but those who responded came from all walks of life, from IIT-Madras students to farmers to civil society activists. Yet, this protest is hardly the only one Tamil Nadu is currently in the grip of.In the port town of Thoothukudi, residents have been protesting for over 50 days against Vedanta-owned Sterlites copper smelter which, they say, is responsible for various ailments among people living in the area. The agitation reached its apogee on March 26, when over 2,00,000 people raised their voice against Sterlite.Near the Bodhi hills in Theni district, too, people are protesting against the proposal to set up a Rs 1,500 crore Neutrino Observatory , an underground laboratory to detect and study neutrinos, in the area. Around 200 km away in Neduvasal in Pudukkottai district, villagers are raring to resume their agitation against ONGCs proposed hydrocarbon project on their lands.A million mutinies, it appears, are raging in the state. The common thread running through this multitude of protests is anger over the perception that Tamil Nadu is being discriminated against.Whether it is the Sterlite protests or Cauvery, it has consistently been brought home that this is something that is unfair to Tamil Nadu as a state, says S Anandhi, professor at Madras Institute of Development Studies. There is an idea that the states demands are fair and yet it is being denied its rights. Thats why there is unanimous support for these movements, across social strata.The Centre and the projects led by it are thus perceived as impinging on the rights of the citizens.This keen sense of Tamil identity and prioritising its interests can be traced back to the Dravidian movement led by stalwarts like Periyar, which began in the 1920s. The movement against Brahminical hegemony and caste system also played a crucial role in launching the anti-Hindi agitation of 1937, when the Congress , led by C Rajagopalachari, introduced Hindi as a compulsory subject in schools in the Madras Presidency.Faced with protests for three years, the order was finally withdrawn. The anti-Hindi agitation reared its head again in the 1960s when it was time for Hindi to be adopted as the sole official language in the country. The Congress government was voted out, never to return to power in the state, and the DMK in 1967 inaugurated the rule of the Dravidian parties in the state.If the Congress was at the receiving end of Tamil ire then, it is now the turn of the BJP. The credibility deficit of the BJP is so strong in Tamil Nadu that whatever goes wrong, people tend to blame the party. The Centre had very little to do with (banning) jallikkattu but if you went to Marina Beach during the protests, you would have seen people raising slogans against Modi.""BJP is seen as a north Indian, Hindi, Hindu party which is against Tamil aspirations, says historian and writer AR Venkatachalapathy. From the beginning, the Dravidian parties had also established a welfare state, perpetuating the notion that the state was the one that would protect its citizens and provide for them, putting their interests first.People in Tamil Nadu have strong faith in the welfare measures of Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa. They compare this with the Central government which, in their minds, is not a welfare state. Few people are aware the rice in PDS has to be given by the Central government. For them, Jayalalithaa or Karunanidhi have launched free rice schemes, which keeps them alive, says Anandhi.This is an idea that the regional parties, whether it is the DMK or AIADMK, have assiduously cultivated. Vekatachalapathy, however, draws a distinction between the current protests and those that happened earlier.I see these protests as relatively new. Most of it is spontaneous, not really organised by political parties. The parties are capitalising on it and riding the wave of resentment.The pro-jallikkattu protests, for instance, that drew thousands to Marina Beach in January 2017, had no single leader. With the death of former CM Jayalalithaa and old age and ill health restricting former CM Karunanidhi, there is a crisis in the polity. People are waiting for a new leadership or movement to emerge.There is also a distinct dichotomy when it comes to issues within the state. For instance, while the Jayalalithaa-led government might give people a free hand to protest against Sri Lankans coming to play cricket in Chennai, it came down hard on any dissidence against itself. The death of Jayalalithaa has now opened up the space for dissent, says Anandhi.The space that has opened up is now being seized by civil society. The widespread of adoption of social media and mobile phones are making it all the easier for people to organise and spread the message of revolt. With every move of the Centre coming under scrutiny in Tamil Nadu, it is now up to the government to assure the people, both in word and in deed, that it is not being discriminated against. Here, perceptions might even be more important than reality."

AR Rajaram, who came from this community, in the year 1967 decided to make a living by doing what he knew best: cooking. He decided to make sweet pongal for an auspicious beginning. He set up shop in the pavement on Old Kuyavarpalayam Road , opposite to New Ramnad Road.Crowds, including those who came to watch movies at Dinamani Theater thronged for his special dish. After his demise, his sons AR Gopalram and AR Ramji decided to expand the business, due to the ever increasing customers and set up a small shop in the nearby street. They began offering idli and dosa in addition to pongal.Now, the third generation of brothers AR Jayaram and AR Madusoodanan operate the business which still just serves food without any cooking taking place at the shop. In addition to sweet Pongal, they now serve ven pongal- the savoury form of it.Due to demand, they have also started making chapatis, dosa, idli at the shop. In addition they serve tomato rice, lemon rice, tamarind rice, curd and chapatis. All the rice dishes are cooked at home and parcelled in banana leaves.The shop opens at 12 noon and goes on till 11.15pm. It has a couple of tables where hungry customer can sit and have their meal.

""An NGO has recently given a presentation to MC officials and councilors in this regard. The NGO claimed that it will fix a chip in each stray dog containing complete information about the animal. They will also conduct a zonal census of the stray dogs . Thereafter, it will carry out the sterilization and dog capturing activity on the lines of existing rates.

So, when I am lucky to get a second chance, I am determined not to return with bare hands. Gold Coast , here we come! Well, Harmeet has fulfilled that wish, and how! The TT champ from Surat played a key role in Team Indias gold medal winning performance, as he won the doubles match in the final against Nigeria. Speaking to Ahmedabad Times from Australia, an elated Harmeet shares: During the last CWG, the mens team had lost to Nigeria and so, this is sweet revenge. I am very happy but the celebrations can wait. I have three more important events lined up and I want to win at least one more medal for India.Right at the top, for sure! Although I have won medals for India in the past, this is certainly the best moment of my career. This is my first CWG medal and the feeling is yet to sink in. I still cant believe that we have finally done it! Not many expected us to go all the way but our hard work and self-belief ensured that we managed to achieve what we wanted. I dedicate this win to my parents, elder brother and my coach Peter Karlson, who stood by me and kept motivating me even when I wasnt going through a great phase.My elder brother sent me a screenshot of some of these messages and it feels really good. But right now, my complete focus is on the remaining events and I will check my social media pages only after all the events get over. I will certainly respond to all the messages and I feel grateful for such love and support. Immediately after the award ceremony, I called up my mom and it was a great feeling when my parents said that they were very proud of what the Indian team had done. Its wonderful to represent the dreams of millions of Indians. When you see the Indian flag flying high after such performances, the feeling cant be described in words. Its magical!Yes. Nobody expected the Indian womens team to win the gold because they were pitted against some very tough opponents. So, when they managed to win in the final, it was a huge source of inspiration for our entire team. For us also, the journey wasnt easy. We had a very tough match against Singapore and at one point, we were trailing in the doubles match. But we managed to turn it around from a very difficult situation and winning that close encounter was a big psychological boost for us.Towards the end of this month, Team India will be playing in the first division after a very long time and I am really looking forward to that. Also, I want to ensure that we win medals at the upcoming Asian Games too.Yes, rice and desserts are no longer part of my diet. Since ice-cream is among my favorite desserts, saying no to it was a very tough decision but this dream of winning the CWG gold eventually convinced me to make that sacrifice. However, I will have an ice-cream now, after the CWG is over. I had promised myself that I will have an ice-cream if we win the CWG gold and now, I think I have earned it (smiles)! As a sportsperson, there are certain sacrifices that you must make but when you win a medal for the country, it really seems worth it. I remember how friends in Surat would ask me to accompany them for movies but I would find an excuse to say no, as I wanted to focus on my training. I havent been to a movie hall in the last two years. Once I am back to Surat, I will watch a film on the big screen!"

The four youths were conversing in Hindi and I understood that they were travelling to Kollegal for some work. I was standing near the van when Naveen called me and showed me the rice bag, the resident told SIT.When I peeped inside the bag, I could see only rice. Naveen then pulled out a pistol. He said the weapon was meant for some big work, sources said quoting the resident.SIT had arrested Naveen on February 18 after recovering 15 rounds of live bullets from him. On March 2, SIT took Naveen into custody for questioning him about his suspected role in Gauris murder. Sleuths approached the court on March 5 seeking permission to subject Naveen to a narco test in Gujarat. The permission was granted on March 12."

Some felt weak to walk up to the stage and they sent their kids to receive the documents. When the children returned with deposit documents, they wouldn't even look at them. They held it folded between their arms and sat silently. tnn"

A market full of grains got drenched in Sohna, destroying at least 400-500 quintals of foodgrain and oilseeds stored in the open, waiting to be transported to the corporations warehouse. With more rain predicted over the next few days, the problem could only get worse.Currently, the government acquires wheat at Rs 1,535 per quintal. Theres no upper limit for acquisition. Mustard is acquired at Rs 4,000 per quintal, with a limit of 25 quintals per farmer. While wheat is acquired by Haryana warehouse corporation, mustard is bought by Haryana state cooperative supply and marketing Federation limited (Hafed) to press for oil sold under their eponymous brand.Mondays loss accrued to the corporation, as it had already bought the crop from farmers. We were able to contain damage during Fridays rains , by placing tarpaulin sheets on the stock. But on Monday, it rained early and took us by surprise, said SDM (Sohna) Satish Yadav, whose office is next to the mandi.For buying mustard, we prepare a roster according to which farmers come here with their crop on different days, he continued. After the rains, uncertainty loomed among mustard farmers on the roster for Monday, who had already arrived with their produce. Were waiting here since 8am. We were earlier told they wont buy mustard today as theres no place to store it after the rains. But weve already paid for transport, and are now incurring more losses for every hour we keep the tractors waiting, said Karan Singh Raghav of Badshapur Tether village.District food and supply controller Ram Avtar said Sohna mandis capacity is just 5,000 tonnes as Gurugram is not counted as an agricultural district, compared to the likes of Karnal, Sirsa and Fathehabad, where mandi capacity runs into lakhs of tonnes. Warehouse corporation has been asked to transport the grain to their storage as soon as possible. If it remains clear on Tuesday, they can even get it dried before storing it, he said.Officials maintained there has been no loss in the fields due to the rains. Unlike northern Haryana districts, rice is not sown here, so sowing and harvesting happens earlier here, he said, adding northern Haryana could face bigger problems due to the rains.Farmers, though, disagreed. At the mandi, Narender from Tether, who has two acres of wheat ready for harvest, said he expects to lose 30% of his crop (around 6 quintals or Rs 10,000). If rains continue, we could lose more. And if we bring it over here, well be asked to get it dried first, he says.Later in the day, SDM Yadav announced that mustard acquisition will go on as scheduled, but wheat farmers will have to dry their produce before its acquired.There would have been no problem if they had built a shed here, said Sohna farmer Suryavir Chaudhary. Officials said the proposal to build a larger warehouse nearby has been on the anvil for a while."

Member of the Tamil Nadu Planning committee, Anil Meshram inaugurated it. The collector added that people continue to consume rice because they lack awareness about millets and their benefits.Madurai leads in barnyard millet (Kudiraivali) cultivation and more farmers are showing interest in taking up the cultivation which brings them good results, as they have learnt the art of branding and processing their products.Professor and head of plant breeding and genetics, Tamil Nadu Agriculture College, Madurai, Dr C Vanniarajan said that the training program was conducted under the Tamil Nadu Innovative Initiatives (TANII) scheme. Last year, they had released the Madurai 1 (MDU1) barnyard millet variety, which was introduced to as many as 125 small farmers, who cultivated the seeds on an acre each.Barnyard millet is a highly drought resistant 90-day-old crop, which can thrive in well irrigated conditions also. The farmers in Thirumangalam block who cultivated the high yielding seeds last year have already harvested the crop and seen good returns have taken up the next phase of cultivation, motivated by the yield.Under the TANII, farmers are given two training programs and field visits per year and are advised to process and brand their products, instead of selling them right after harvesting. Selling millet as soon as it is harvested will bring them about Rs 18 to Rs 20 per kilogram, value addition and processing could help them to fetch Rs 80 to Rs 100 for the same product, Vanniarajan said.This millet had slowly lost its place in the diets of Indians because of the husk or the outer covering of the millet cannot be completely removed and gives a slightly bitter taste. Under this scheme, special millet processing units are installed which help the farmers to polish it almost as well as rice, he said.As it is rich in iron and has a lower glycemic index of 41 % against 51 % in rice, it suitable for women, especially those who are anaemic and also diabetic patients. He said at present, many people were trying to give value addition to the millet in the form of cookies, but it can be used to make curd rice and also replace rice in idlies and become a part of our daily diet, he said.The seeds can be stored up to 10 years and Thirumangalam farmers have seen a yield of 500 to 600 kilograms per acre and now the farmers of Kallkikudi are to be sensitised on the cultivation of barnyard millet, he added."
