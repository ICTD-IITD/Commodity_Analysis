The paddy procured from Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Thanjavur would be loaded on train wagons at stations such as Needamangalam, Peralam, Tiruvarur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai, Sirkazhi, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur and Kumbakonam in the delta districts. Trichy railway division has been generating revenue through freight by transporting several tonnes of paddy to various destinations.However, shortage of water and the severe drought have been bringing down the acres of agriculture land under cultivation as well as the yield drastically in recent years. Trichy railway division had transported 6.07 lakh tonnes of paddy bags in 216 rakes. However, this volume had dropped to 2.98 lakh tonnes transported on 106 rakes during 2016-17. This was a 50.8 per cent decline compared to the previous year, railway sources said.During the current year, the railways has so far handled 1.40 lakh tonnes on 50 rakes. Officials said this drastic decline was due to the failure of paddy cultivation because of water shortage. This had reflected in the revenue of the railways also, officials said. Since thousands of lorries and load men were involved in the process, almost 70 per cent of lorry drivers, cleaners and load men too have lost their jobs in the last few years, a lorry driver, S Manivannan, said."

But this will last barely for another week after which we will face a serious problem, says Kalpesh Jain, who runs a store in Sakkardara.For the last two-three days, I have been giving jute bags which are used by distributors and wholesalers to pack. I have asked customers to store them and bring them back to the shop next time, says Jain, who is planning to get cloth bags of all dimensions stitched out of old saris and clothes to use at his store.With notices being put up outside grocery stores saying no plastic carry bags will be provided, customers now will have to get used to bringing their own bags or shell out for reusable ones.People have still not got into the habit of carrying bags to stores, says Virendra Sahu, who runs a provision store at Golibar Chowk. So far, we were packing dry kirana items like dal, rice, sugar and others in virgin plastic bags which come without handle. Paper bags are no substitute as they are not sturdy, says Sahu.Wrapping items in newspapers and tying them with strings will be very time-consuming, so we are not even looking at the option, he adds.Agreeing that newspaper wrapping of grocery is a big no, Dhanesh Jethani, who has a grocery store in Khamla, says, We do not get the kind of hard working labour who would sit and pack the stuff and tie them with a string.Identifying the items while billing and making delivery also becomes a problem when they are not packed in plastic bags. We are waiting for some solutions to emerge and will follow accordingly, he says.The ban has provoked both dismay and praise, but the biggest question for many is what will happen when the supply of plastic bags dries up? Finding an alternate, calculating its cost are the biggest challenges facing us today, says Harish Pitalwar, who runs an online grocery store.Our services include home deliveries, so we cant ask customers to provide bags. Besides, a person who orders online is accustomed to decent packing of items ordered by him, says Pitalwar.So far, items are placed in huge plastic bags and delivered. But now we are thinking of getting big stainless steel crates in which we will put vegetables. For groceries, there is still no option, though we are testing bags made with corn starch for its strength, he adds."

In Surat - the city of foodies - there are endless options to indulge in fat free varieties too, that have now joined the versatile menu. Even if I say so, this columnists mother prepares the most exotic version of sabudana khichdi - the sago is succulent and jelly like - yet, the composition is grainy, infused with grated potatoes with their skins on, crunchy and coarse roasted peanut tidbits, zingy green chillies and fresh nutritious curry leaves. What brings out the best of this combinations flavour is her bespoke curry, peanut chutney with the goodness of jaggery and lemon. Sabudana actually has 0% fat, but its versatility makes it eligible for crunchy pakodas, kheer, chakris and wafers, which are high in calorie. Depend on this tapioca pearls for high energy providing carbohydrate. Another local favourite is steamed dhokla made of samo rice (moriyo chawal). This Indian barnyard millet is also prepared as a delicious stew cooked over low heat in buttermilk .Those who are diabetic or calorie conscious can opt for buckwheat (kuttu) preparations instead of starchy water chestnut flour. Benefits of buckwheat are several - from lowering cholesterol and blood pressure, this gluten-free flour provides protein in a highly digestible form along with supplying vitamins and minerals. To avoid deep fried puris, one can opt crispy bhakris, cottage cheese stuffed parathas cooked on a non-stick skillet without fat or good old khichdi instead.Foodies with a sweet tooth often depend on fast friendly mithais prepared with milk, but those rasgullas, mawa malai pendas and shrikhand bowls will just send the glucose index soaring. Munch on a handful of walnuts and almonds instead , mixed with teenie weenie bits of half a date or chomp on a rajgira chikki . Chilled Greek yoghurt (probiotic goodness) mixed with fresh fruits such as grapes, strawberries or mango chunks tastes heavenly and mixing half a teaspoon of chia seeds in the same before devouring turns it too good to believe!A lesser known ingredient  ube yam  purple in colour, rich in antioxidants, contains almost no fat, is high in potassium and is just what a doctor would recommend for a nutritive dose. Whether boiled, steamed, sauted or fried, it retains its distinct flavour and is a favourite with the locals. Relish thin baked crispy chips sprinkled with fresh lemon juice and coriander chilli chutney. Trust me, it gladdens the soul.Superfood sweet potato, shakkaria as Gujaratis call, is natures gift to diabetics. While the rest of the earth is discovering its greatness, Surtis have been including it in their diets since ages. For fasting, its oven roasted version with sprinkles of salt and pepper is suffice to survive through the day.

A health check-up campaign by Fortis hospital , which screened 138 women cops between the age group of 21 and 45 years, has revealed that they suffer from deficiencies and lifestyle health issues. The cops were tested for complete blood count, pulmonary function, blood sugar and blood pressure. They also had eye and dental check-ups.The test reports have revealed that an alarming 45% of women cops posted in the district are anaemic i.e., they have low count of red blood cells, which lowers the ability of blood to carry oxygen and weakens the body.The is the first time that Fortis has undertaken such a campaign, focussing on women cops, with its CSR funds.It is worrying that 45% of female cops are anaemic. This indicates menstrual cycle and nutritional irregularities, which lead to morbidity. They even lack awareness about their health and dont go for preventive check-ups. It is high time we apply WHO standards in India for haemoglobin levels in women. We will prescribe and give iron tablets to these cops and will conduct a regular health camp for them every six months, said Dr Rahul Bhargava, director, bone marrow transplant, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon.Cops spend considerable time outdoors for investigations. The exposure to high pollution levels is weakening their vital organs, said experts. Nearly 8% of the women cops were diagnosed with asthma and pollution-related respiratory disorders. Additionally, the cops handling traffic duties were found to be having dry eyes and allergies. Nearly 3% of them have high blood pressure, and 2% have been diagnosed with high blood sugar.The more revealing fact is that these cops are unaware of their medical conditions as most of them do not go for regular health check-ups.According to a 50-year-old woman sub-inspector, the number of women cops is limited and they have to investigate all women-related crimes as well as go for VIP and protest duties, which make it difficult for them to take care of themselves.There are times when we dont even drink water while on field duty. We spend some days on tea while visiting locations for investigations. It is embarrassing to ask for food or buy food when at work.The starting salary for a cop in the constable rank is nearly Rs 21,000 while for a head constable, the minimum salary is nearly Rs 26,000. A sub-inspector, on the other hand, starts at nearly Rs 35,000. Many women cops said that it was not financially viable to eat out with such salaries.A young woman recruit said, Many of us have to commute to the workplace from our houses in other districts. Sometimes, we skip breakfast because we have to rush to work. We cannot bring tiffin from home daily and nor do we get time to eat out. So, we dont go for lunch and get a very late dinner.Senior officials understand the plight of these cops but they believe a little nutritional knowledge is also needed. Their staple diet is roti or rice with dal and sabzi. It is filling but lacks micronutrients. Cops need to eat more nutritional food and we will help develop that awareness, said a senior woman police officer.The senior men in the police department are not even surprised with the high levels of malnourishment and weak health among their female counterparts. A senior official said, We need to understand their social and economic situation before talking about their health. A majority of them come from a rural background where they eat a heavy breakfast and dinner. There is no concept of lunch there. This continues when they join the force, too, as there is hardly any time for lunch. Considering their low salaries, they want to avoid splurging on fruits or juices while working on the field. Naturally, they are underweight and suffer from deficiencies.DCP (headquarters) Deepak Gahlawat said, We are aware that there might be some health concerns among women cops. We will continue with health check-ups and provide necessary medical aid to them."

All Indira canteens in the state operational thus far are in the district headquarters and Thokkottu is an exception to this norm, he said.Khader said plans are afoot to change the timings of the canteen from present 8am to 10am to 7am to 9.30am. This is being done to help labourers, daily wage earners who are required to reach their work places early, he said, adding timings for lunch and dinner served at the canteen will remain unchanged. Pickle and boiled rice has been added to the afternoon menu based on public feedback for canteens in the city, he said.The canteens will continue dispensing 500 food tokens for each of the three servings during the day, Khader said adding footfalls at the canteens in the city barring the facility at Urwa Store that also houses the master kitchen, are in sync with tokens dispensed. The committee headed by DC S Sasikanth Senthil will take a decision on modifying the menu as per local demands and the same will be cleared by the high powered committee in Bengaluru, Khader added.On the future of these canteens in case the Congress does not come to power, Khader said this being a government programme, will continue irrespective of the party that rules the state. We continued the Vajpayee Arogya Shree programme started by the previous government and went on to broadbase and implement it pan-Karnataka, Khader said, adding the thrust of these canteens is to provide affordable means to people from economically backward strata of society."

An MCom graduate, he has been channelising his energy towards propagating the benefits of growing these plants and how badly the future generation would need them.A Siva, 36, of Thiruvenkadu in Sirkali taluk of the district is a progressive farmer of his locality who has been growing rice and vegetables organically. Inspired by Sivansar, brother of Kanchi Maha Periyavar, he started cultivating herbal and medicinal plants 20 years ago on his one-acre land.He also grows rare trees like Maha Vilvam, Rudraksham, Sowkanti, Kalkaram, Brahma Kamalam, Sarkarai Vilvam, Raja Vilvam and Panneer flower tree. Besides these, he also has different varieties of Sanjeevini, the plant which sustains age, such as Raja Sanjeevini, Amirtha Sanjeevini, Mrudhanga Sanjeevini and Narayana Sanjeevini Cultivation of medicinal plant is gaining ground because of the skyrocketing prices of allopathic medicines which have side effects. Besides, cultivation of medicinal plants is economically viable. I sell rare plants to many siddha doctors who have been visiting my nursery from across Tamil Nadu and even Bangalore, Siva said. He also prescribes particular trees or plants to his customers based on their zodiac sign or star. He has plants and trees for 27 stars, 12 zodiacs and nine Navagrahas. If people raise trees or plants related to their star or zodiac, they would give out a positive vibration which would benefit their physical as well as mental health, he said.Siva says marketing of medicinal plants was very important since, unlike food crop which has universal demand, they were not much sought-after. He rues the fact that people have been showing no interest in raising medicinal plants in their garden. People should come forward to raise one or two medicinal and herbal plants. Those who have terrace garden can also try. It would help stop these rare species from getting extinct, he added.For instance, he points out that anyone can plant a popular medicinal plant like Aloe Vera for commercial purpose as the profits were quite high. It belonged to Liliaceae family. Normally, the inner area of the leaves are jelly-like with bad odour and bitter taste. But, a rare variety  Red Aloe Vera  had no such bad attributes and was known to cure 60 types of diseases. It was also prescribed for fertility-related issues.Like Aloe Vera, each and every plant has its own medicinal value. We should focus on the treasure we already have to avoid spending huge money to get rid of our ailments. The government should also do something to create awareness about these medicinal plants among the general public, he further said."

After the introduction of smart card, this practice was withdrawn.Instead of officials blocking the cards, card holders should come forward to give up ration items, if they are not purchasing them. While the government wont allot commodities for these card holders, they can continue to use them as identity cards the official said.While about 126 people, including rice and sugar card holders, had opted for the give it up option in the past three months, as many as 4,739 families have chosen to have no commodity cards, according to an official source.In Coimbatore, they are about 9,97,443 card holders. Of them, 8,45,951 are rice card holders and 75,101 are sugar card holders, who, according to sources, could opt for the give it up option.The move would also help the deserving get the essential commodities, said G Rajendren of Tamil Nadu Ration Shop Employees Association. Presently, the government does not allot commodities to all the registered shops in an area and the ration items are sold on first come, first serve basis. Hence, some card holders dont t get the commodities. Once people opt for give it up option, things will change, he said.Rajendren has, however, some reservations. Even though the move could curtail illegal procuring to an extent, unless the government brings in more stringent rules, malpractices will continue, he said."

But with water from one acre of rice, at least four acres of millets can be cultivated, he said.Chandrakanth, who compiled the paper jointly with Kiran Kumar R Patil, assistant professor, University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences (UAHS), Shimoga said that millets being climate smart crops, can be harvested within 70 to 90 days, as compared to 105 days for all other food grains.Millets, a low water crop, are fetching a better price for its dietary fibre, vitamins, minerals and protein compared with rice and wheat, and urban population prone to diabetes and health problems are increasingly consuming it. Considering that the drinking water needs, which are much less than agriculture, are the citizens fundamental right, Chandrakanth called for promotion of such crops and removal of market imperfections to boost farmers profits.Irrigation water cost has been treated as virtually free, he said. Farmers need to be educated on choice of right crops, pumping right volume of water through sound water budgeting, not maximizing output per acre, but maximizing net returns per rupee of the water cost, he said. The conference featured four plenary sessions, 25 oral presentations and 12 poster presentations as speakers from academic and research bodies such as NEERI, CSIR-NIO, NCAOR, National Institute of Hydrology and Goa University , spoke.Shalini Dhyani, scientist, National Environment Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur, spoke on the need to integrate government initiatives to curb harmful effects of climate change with peoples cooperation."

It has found that farmers, including tribal cultivators, have managed to cultivate and preserve 62 traditional rice varieties, including rare and endangered varieties.The survey was conducted from February 20- 26 by the state agriculture department and Kerala Agriculture University (KAU) with participation of 43 students from the College of Agriculture, Padannakkad.The survey has also been able to collect some important facts about the native rice varieties like duration of crop, unique features, geographic location, yield, nutritional value, size and colour of the varieties and seed, and climate-change and pest resistance qualities of the varieties. The information along with the contact details of the farmers have also been compiled into a directory. Rajendran , associate director of research at the regional agriculture research station (RARS) of KAU at Ambalavayal said that detailed information about the 62 rice varieties were collected by meeting the farmers directly.The fact that the farmers of the district have managed to preserve such a significant number of indigenous rice landraces despite facing several odds is commendable. The value of silent food biodiversity conservation undertaken by them is invaluable and they should be honoured for their service apart from providing financial and technical incentives, he added.Among the indigenous Wayanadan varieties, many of which are rare and confined to small pockets in the district, are ayiram kana, edavaka, onamottan, karimbalan, kumkumashali, kurumbali, peruvazha, vethandam, karutha njavara etc,.Many traditional rice varieties of Wayanad are highly resilient against climatechange and are stress-tolerant apart from having aromatic and medicinal properties.The district used to have highly-diverse rice varieties numbering around 105.Deputy director of agriculture, Rani S K said that a detailed genetic-level study on the rice varieties of Wayanad should be conducted for a varietal evaluation.The government has already announced a special agriculture zone for floriculture and speciality rice in Wayanad and various schemes are under implementation for helping farmers preserve the native rice varieties."

Tracing the soul of Tamil Nadu through Kolams and Sangam poetry is what researcher-artist Chantal Jumel has been doing for two decades. Kolams in different patterns, colours and designs has helped her explore the more abstract ideas of the philosophy that propels popular culture in the state.Jumel talked about her doodles of kolams and the idea of cryptograms, which are paintings or drawings using the written word in a picture format. The conversation turned out to be her art using the symbol of Om that she found being used as a meditative practice in Indian culture. ""Dance and traditional floor paintings of South India have been a part of my journey ever since I landed here decades ago. I love the vibrant and lesser known arts that unfold in the domestic context such as ephemeral diagrams drawn on thresholds with rice powder. Kolams attain a fresh meaning and perspective in my works,"" says Jumel, whose works titled Inner landscapes are on display at Apparao Galleries in Chennai.Jumels journey through the intricate patterns and designs of kolams and Sangam poems was challenging. In her works, Jumel weaves together the spirit of kolams, ritual designs, images of deities, mantras and spiritual traditions. ""I repeatedly use the syllable Om as a unique script character to create visual poetry. It is a meditational practice and a celebration of the universal need for connection,"" said Jumel, who is specialised in Indian visual and performing art.Jumel has used Sangam poetry as a reference in several works. Her Life Path accompanies a Sangam poem: Friends/his seas swell and roar/Making conch shells whirl on the sands/But fishermen ply their little wooden boats/Unafraid of the cold lashes of the waves/Look my bangles slip loose as he leaves/Grow tight as he returns/And they give me away/. ""I have used Sangam poems as a reference in some works while moving towards a minimalist approach to the picture that is simple yet dense. The density comes from the repetitive use of the symbol and the simplicity in the translation of ideas,"" said the Paris-based artist.Jumel has travelled across the south to know more about the social and cultural practices associated with each place. In Tamil Nadu, she was attracted towards the kolams and Sangam poetry, Kerala offered her its traditional and folk themes. ""I used a medium that could communicate my ideas through poems and drawings. The Sangam poems and kolams attain a sophisticated form. And this is what I was looking for,"" she said."

Currently ranking at No 5, the former numero uno archer is raring to go  training nine hours daily for six days a week to win the Olympic gold. The sheer positivity that this small-town, dimpled girl radiates is disarming. Smiling widely, she says, Once I get the Olympic Gold in 2020, I will strive to get gold in 2024. I am 23 and I will keep doing this. In an interview with Bombay Times, she talks about her humble beginnings, her trials and tribulations, handling fame and more. ExcerptsDeepika never dreamt that she would be an archer one day. And the reason that led her to take up the sport was not the love of archery, but the circumstances at home. She says, When I was in school, I did not know anything about archery. My mother was a nurse in RMCH, Ranchi, and my father was a rickshaw driver. Hum garmi mein bina fan ke rehte the, chuhon ke beech. Washroom bhi nahi tha. We used to go to a nearby river to take a bath, where wild elephants roamed about freely. We didnt even have proper food  we would eat leftover rice with soaked chana for our meals.It was on one of her vacations at her maternal grandmothers home in Lohardaga ( Jharkhand ) that she heard about the sport  her second cousin was training to be an archer. Uss ladki ne mujhe hostel life ke baare mein bataya. I saw archery as an opportunity to stay in a hostel where everything was taken care of. Main family ka burden kam karna chahti thi. So, I took the relevant phone numbers, called up the authorities on my own and fixed everything. But I had to go to Jamshedpur  it was a huge thing then as I was only 12. All hell broke loose when I told my parents about it. But then I told them that I had arranged everything, all they had to do was, accompany me. So, they all came along with me to Jamshedpur  I broke down when I didnt get selected initially. We were told to get a permission letter from the then CMs wife. My father got that done and the rest is history.On tasting success, young Deepika asked her father to quit rickshaw driving, but he refused. He still insists on doing his job and does not want to quit. My father told me, Tum apna kaam karo, main apna kaam karta hoon. My mother still works as a nurse. My younger sister was training to be an archer and recently got a job, while my brother just appeared for his tenth standard exams.Despite attaining a status of an international athlete, life is not easy in small districts. People would talk, but all of that would not reach me much, because meri Mamma bahut kam batati thi mujhe. She would say, Usko game pe concentrate karne do. My Papa also supported me, but would, sometimes, get swayed by what his colleagues would tell him. Later, he also began ignoring what people said, says Deepika, adding that together, her parents helped her reach where she is today.Early on in her career, Deepika witnessed fandom and took it in her stride. When I became World No. 1, I didnt even know how big a deal it was. A girl came up to me and said, I cant believe that I am standing in front of the World No. 1 archer. Mujhe chakkar aa raha hai, main girne wali hoon It was funny. I am a simple, normal girl and do not really like the fame. I am not into social media. I dont like being online all the time.Deepika begins her day early in the morning and then trains the whole day with meal breaks, for six days a week. I believe in working hard. I train almost nine hours a day for six days a week. Yoga, meditation, gym, cardio, weights, exercises and of course, shooting. Har din ka workout and training planned hota hai. Hamara khana bhi nutritionists plan kartein hain, she informs. Now I dont have to bother about cooking. I get a nutrition-rich food everyday planned by experts. Life changed after I took up this sport."

But for the bulk orders, we have to make eight-ten packages at a time, which is very time consuming. Business has slowed down by 40% due to this, said vendor Hazrat Haldewale Meanwhile, several vendors have alternatively started stocking cloth bags worth Rs 10 or Rs 20, depending on size, although the move has not yet worked out in their favour. Customers will not purchase a bag worth Rs 10 to carry greens worth Rs 20. People must also be advised by the government to carry bags from home, said vendor Hyder Ali.While vegetable vendors are still managing to function, those who sell of pulses and grains are in bigger trouble. The government should have thought of an alternative for businesses like ours. We approached the CCP and they said to charge people for paper bags. Doing that will further decrease our customers, since they will prefer to go to the mall and buy readymade packets of rice instead of coming to the market. We have already seen a 45% decrease in profits after the ban, said vendor Nitin Mandrekar Many others, however, are very optimistic about this change. Miramar-resident Joseph Ferrao said, In olden days we used to carry our own bag to the market. Now, that good practice is making a comeback.We sell high-value vegetables like cherry tomatoes whose cost goes up in hundreds per kilogram. Customers dont mind paying an extra Rs 10 to purchase a cloth bag. We make Rs 5 on the bag, so the ban has actually worked in our favour, said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.Naomi M from Pilerne said, The services of some self-help groups must be utilised to make and provide newspaper bags. They are very common in Mumbai and the practice can be adopted here as well. The vendors can charge a nominal amount for it. This way, plastic bags are replaced, paper is recycled and someone gains employment."

Maharashtra Plastic Manufacturers Association office bearers said huge plastic sheets were tradionally used to store food items such as pulse, rice and sugar.Association president Ravi Jashnani said plastic bags were used not only to pack processed food, but also garments and hosiery materials during transport. He said, Expensive saris and dress material were packed in transparent plastic, while bales were wrapped in plastic sheets for protection from dust and water. Plastic bags were used to pack food even in government-initiated midday meal scheme.Jashnani added that the association recently wrote to the chief minister and the environment minister on the issue.MAHA Farmers Producer Company Ltd director Amit Naphade said plastic was the cheapest material available to farmers to avoid crop damage. The fodder is covered with plastic and kept in open fields because most farmers do not have sheds. After harvesting, crops such as tur, soya are covered with plastic and stored on fields. The farmers do not have the space to keep such huge quantities at home. We are not against the ban, but the state should have thought about suitable alternatives, he said.Farmer Purushottam Mangte Patil from Vyala village in Balapur district said covering the produce in plastic to protect it from water was the easiest way.

Social workers of Project for Children who are in Contact with Railway Stations (CCRS) rescued four children, all below 18 years of age, at the Trichy railway junction on Friday night.Upon inquiry, the four boys said that they were from Bihar and looking for jobs in Tamil Nadu . After staying the night at the facility at the railway junction, the NGO brought the four boys to their centre at Cantonment before producing them before the child welfare committee (CWC) in the city.One of the boys, however, showed stiff resistance from appearing before the CWC and tried his best to escape. Despite counselling and advice from a social worker well versed in Hindi, the boy remained hostile. When he was taken out, he grabbed on to a car to stay put and prevented the car from moving. On information, Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP) arrived and tried their best to convince him. He stood firm on his demand that he should be let off.Eventually, NGO officials made him understand the legal procedures to be followed and convinced him to appear for the CWC enquiry. All the four boys were handed over to CWC who will decide their next move, K Govindaraju, project director of CCRS told TOI.CWC will make arrangements to send them back home or stay at a recognised reception home in Trichy.Launched on January 23 this year, the NGO has so far rescued 216 children including 198 boys and 18 girls at the Trichy railway junction.Many of the rescued children had left home owing to poor performance in academics followed by reprimanding from parents or in search of job driven by poverty. In some cases, brokers had hired the boys from north India for a meagre sum from their parents to employ them in rice mills in Thanjavur for paltry remuneration.Of the rescued children, 56 boys and three girls were rehabilitated through CWC while 142 boys and 15 girls were reunited with their parents with the help of RPF and GRP."

Eight industrial units, on the other hand, have been asked to explain why they should not be closed for violating pollution norms.Of the 177 industrial units, 163 are brick kilns, eight rice mills, a tobacco unit, a hot mix plant and an oil manufacturing unit. Six industrial units, including two sugar mills, two biofuel units, a rice mill and a food oil unit have been served closure notices for violating pollution norms.Under Section 33A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, a bank guarantee of Rs 20 lakh had sought from Riga Sugar Company Limited in Sitamarhi and two other industrial units. Riga Sugar Company Limited was charged with continuously discharging harmful effluents into the Manushmara river. Closure notices have also been issued to Majhaulia Sugar Mill in West Champaran and New Swadeshi Sugar Mill at Narkatiyaganj in West Champaran for polluting the Kohara and Harbora rivers, respectively.The Riga Sugar Company has already paid the bank guarantee and promised to mend its ways. The two remaining industrial units have so far not submitted the bank guarantees, BSPCB public relation officer Birendra Kumar said.Also, two biofuel units  HPCL Limited, Sugauli (East Champaran) and HPCL Limited, Lauriya (West Champaran)  have been marked under proposed closure notice.

Instead, he says more drastic measures are needed. The former principal plant breeder at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila, has recommended broadcast sowing of pre-germinated rice seed without puddling and eliminating raising seedlings in the nursery.Direct sowing needs 30% less water and saves lot of labour costs. Many countries have switched to direct sowing of rice. I feel direct sowing is a winwin technology, particularly under declining water resources, Khush, who was awarded the 1996 World Food Prize, told TOI in an email exchange.Even the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, has devoted a page in its Package of Practices for Kharif Crops to unpuddled DSR, mentioning suitable soil types, required field preparations, suitable varieties, sowing time, seed treatment, seed rate and method of sowing, weed control, irrigation and fertilizer application.The varsity has mentioned that short duration paddy variety PR115 is most suitable for direct seeded rice and the ideal sowing time is June 1-15 inPunjab.On the other hand, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairperson Kahan Singh Pannu said farmers were wary of opting for the DSR method of cultivating paddy as the efforts to produce this technique in the state had not yielded the desired results in the past.Area under DSR paddy cultivation had once touched nearly 1 lakh hectares in Punjab. However, the farmers didnt adopt this method in a big way as they found the crop had more weeds and even the yield was not stable. Due to this uncertainty, Punjab farmers stopped following the DSR method of paddy cultivation, said Pannu, an MSc in agriculture (entomology) from PAU, Ludhiana."

This has put dairy farmers in the district, with nearly 2.56 lakh milch animals, in tight spot even as the summer has just begun to intensify.Agriculture has been consistently waning in the district with poor rainfall and irregular monsoon. As has been the practice, farmers augment their agriculture income by raising a couple of cows or buffaloes with available water to cultivate green fodder.According to dairy farmers association, there are nearly 50,000 dairy farmers in the district. With green pastures turning dearer, farmers who attended the farmers grievance redressal meeting held at the collectors office last week brought to fore the issue, urging the district administration to provide dry fodder, as was the case last year.Considering the drought condition previous year, the animal husbandry department established ten dry-fodder depots in the district and provided 1,150 tonnes of dry fodder to dairy farmers. Each dairy farmer was provided 105kg of hay-fodder as the maximum ceiling.During the meeting, farmer V R Muthupeyandi from Chellampatti block told district collector K Veera Raghava Rao that they cannot save their cattle if dry fodder is not arranged this year too.District secretary of Tamil Nadu Dairy Farmers Association A Muthupandi said that dairy farmers are under enormous stress to get fodder. If there are no summer rains in the next ten days, it will be difficult to maintain the cattle, he said.Further, dairy farmers also rued that the fodder subsidy provided to them by state government has been withdrawn. They were provided Rs 4 per kilogram of mixed fodder (kuchipunnakku) as subsidy and was withdrawn from April.Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 23 to Rs 28 in 2014. The procurement prices have not been revised since then but the fodder prices have almost doubled, Muthupandi said.For instance, one bag (50 kg) of mixed fodder which costed Rs 650 has increased to Rs 910. One kilogram of rice husk, the ordinary fodder provided to milch animals, has increased from Rs 3.5 per kg to Rs 10 now.While the price of fodder is increasing, we are not getting back due remuneration. In addition, this summer has left us in a lurch without fodder to feed our animals, Muthupandi added.Joint director of animal husbandry Dr R Rajasekaran said that the department has sent a revised proposal of requesting 1,400 - 1,500 tonnes of dry (hay) fodder to give away to farmers from the same 10 depots established earlier. We are awaiting state governments nod, he said."

As per the data compiled by the India Meteorological Department IMD ), in the given period, Punjab has had 35 deficient monsoon (more than 20% to 59% below the normal precipitation in the June-September period) rainfall years while Haryana witnessed 36 deficient monsoon rainfall years.The situation is grimmer if the data of the last 10 years (2008-2017) is taken into account as both states recorded deficient monsoon rainfall for six years or more. In the past 10 years, Punjab had deficient monsoon rainfall six times in 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. During the same period, monsoon failed seven times (2007, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) in neighbouring Haryana.Despite poor monsoon rainfall, area under water-guzzling paddy has not reduced in both Punjab and Haryana, known as the grain bowl states of India, which are biggest contributors of food grain to the national buffer stock. In 2017, Punjab had an estimated 29.42 lakh hectares area under paddy including basmati while in Haryana the estimated acreage under rice cultivation was 14.22 lakh hectares.Area under other kharif crops like cotton oilseed and pulses has gone down in both states with more farmers opting to grow paddy due to assured marketing as the grain is purchased by the government agencies at the minimum support price (MSP).Weaker monsoons have resulted in putting more strain on the groundwater in both Punjab and Haryana. With less availability of canal water, farmers in both states rely on tubewells to irrigate their crops, hoping for the normal rainfall to eventually recharge the groundwater. With truant monsoons, groundwater recharge has not been to the optimal levels, leading to lowering of water table in both states.In 2017, Punjab received 384.9mm rainfall, which is 22% below the normal precipitation of 491.9mm while Haryana recorded a deficit of 26% at 341.9mm against the normal of 459.8mm. On the other hand, the average rainfall in the country was recorded at 841.3mm, 5% below the normal of 887.3mm. According to IMD, deficit up to 20% of t h e normal monsoon rainfall (June to September) is taken as normal precipitation.In the given scenario, there have been appeals from leading farm scientists to reduce the area under paddy cultivation in both states, especially Punjab, to prevent further depletion of precious groundwater. Leading geneticist and rice breeder Gurdev Singh Khush, who retired as the head of the division of plant breeding genetics and biochemistry at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila, has advised crop diversification to reduce the area under paddy. This issue has been talked about for last 30 years but nobody has proposed an alternative crop. I have suggested soybean as possibility but nobody has paid any attention, Khush stated in an email exchange with TOI."

She issued a direction to the director (civil supplies) and notices to villages (officials of local bodies), giving them a four-week deadline (May 31) to make villages clean. She also wrote to chief minister V Narayanasamy, conveying her decision.Last two years, I have not seen local representatives and public officials determined to make rural Puducherry clean within a time frame. I am sorry this cannot go on. This was the 155 Morning Weekend Round Of Team RajNivas spanning over the last two years. Yet we have not transformed in proportion to the effort and energy that has gone into, she said.She said the free rice scheme will be implemented in the villages only after the MLAs and commissioners of the commune panchayats concerned issue a joint certification that the villages are clean and free of strewn garbage.In order to inculcate a sense of responsibility amongst the local community, it should keep its localities clean and healthy, said Bedi. The rice distribution shall therefore be made conditional to the certification that the village is open defecation free and free of strewn garbage and plastics, she said in the letter addressed to Narayanasamy.Bedi said the certification shall also be cross-checked to ensure its veracity. She expressed optimism that the move will inculcate a sense of responsibility among the people and will hasten the objective of Swachh Grameen Union territory.Bedis controversial decision will lead to a fresh round of confrontation between the Narayanasamy-led Congress government and the Raj Nivas. AIADMK legislature party leader A Anbalagan came down heavily on Bedi accusing her of humiliating, denigrating and demeaning the poor people who depend on rice given free of cost by the government.He said the government, which spends several crores of rupees, engaging a private firm to keep the town limits clean, had failed to take similar initiatives in keeping the villages clean. He held the administration and government officials concerned responsible for the poor civic and sanitation amenities in the rural parts of the territory and not the poor villagers.Eom"

Panjab University law student Devika Raj , who attended three sessions on Sunday, said: Some people were taking notes while the human books were talking. But a big life cannot fit into a small notebook.Visitor Aniruddh Nanda found human book and mountaineer cop Daljinder Singh most inspiring. Nanda said: What he has done is unique and it requires a lot of determination. I felt like taking his positive energy home. Another reader liked learning about vegan fashion (which is fashion without fur, silk, or leather) and Chandigarhs first bikers cafe. The event went on from 1pm to 5.30pm at Lucos Pocio in the Industrial Area Phase I.The human library is a place where real people are on loan to readers for a chat. Its a place where difficult questions are expected, appreciated, and answered. These conversations challenge stereotypes and prejudices through dialogue.You read feminism wrongIshita Uppal Unconventional StorytellerThe world believes that feminism is about putting the men down, but this human book is out to change that opinion. Ishita Uppal, 21, is second-year law student at Panjab University, but in the world of human books, they call her Unconventional Storyteller.Sitting among people as a book from the human library here on Sunday, she talked her readers through her experience of forming volunteer organisation SWAG (Strong Women and Girls) in 2016, which works for the progress of both genders, teaches self-defence to poor girls, and raises money for animal shelters. I was always a sensitive observer, Uppal said. At 12, the-then government of Bhupinder Singh Hooda appointed me a brand ambassador of Haryana to promote girls education and campaign against female infanticide. I worked for this twin cause for the next five years.Dance like a man, HaryanaManish Kumar Prima BallerinaPrima Ballerina Manish Kumar (27) showed his readers the ugly side of gender norms. His is the tale of a Haryanvi kathak dancer, who is sacred to follow his passion in his home state. People in Haryana do not understand the idea of a mans being a classical dancer. They have bullied, harassed, and cursed me over the last four years, he said.Manish spoke about confronting fragile masculinity, disrespect, and violence that prevented him from going to rehearsals. He said: I could not practice with my ghungroos (musical anklets) on. They said I was not man enough to like something stereotypically manly. They made fun of my gestures. I forgive them for their lack of awareness. Manish has moved to Patiala to pursue his passion.This vegan advice has a lot of meatDr Varun Gupta Realistic VeganDr Varun Gupta, in his book avatar Realistic Vegan, spoke about being a flexible vegan as different from an idealistic vegan. A lot of people these days are kattar (hardcore) vegan, he says, and they spoil their family relationships in the pursuit of protecting their belief. I am a vegan, too, he says, but I dont tend to forget that people around me are not and I cannot have my way with them. You have to be adjusting and flexible. The doctor suggested finding alternatives such as rice for buttered naan (Indian bread) at weddings and going for non-milky desserts, if one can help it. For people who find being vegan expensive, he advised using soya beans to produce own milk at home.Courage loftier than EverestDaljinder Singh A Journey of a Thousand MilesPanjab Police officials Daljinder Singh made scaling Mount Everest his ultimate dream after losing three colleagues in an avalanche on that lofty peak in 2005. When even after 10 years, no one from the department came forward to pick up their flag and finish the expedition, he dared to take the challenge. Speaking has human book Expedition: A journey of a thousand miles, Daljinder Singh explained that years of training with a singular aim had got him to this destination in May 2017. The biggest hurdle, he says, was raising 25-lakh rupees. A lot of people told me to back down but I was determined to succeed. After conquering Mt Everest, Daljinder Singh made the world record of being the only policeman who bicycled under water for 150 metres. The Goan feat also got him into the Limca Book of Records and the Asia Book of Records."

Also an erstwhile member of Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti then and National Youth Programme started by SN Subbarao, Borkar contributed to national service before turning to improve his own as well as nearby districts through agriculture. He shared about some of his achievements and endeavours in a chat with TOI. Excerpts from an interview...A. I always thought that youth comes with some powers which should not be wasted. We wanted to make positive contributions to the society and we started by organizing public oriented programs on important national and international days. We would canvass public participation and discuss issues of vital importance. Soon, government officials started involving me in helping organize their events for health, addiction or forests.A. We started taking part in Indias social movements. I was chosen to lead Maharashtras delegates to Nehru Yuva Kendra camp in Tamil Nadu. On returning, we decided to establish a youth group in every village, and Bhandra and Gondia were one district. We succeeded in forming 450 youth groups, all of whom we trained for five days on leadership. As a part of the National Youth Programme, we were entrusted with clearing off the bodies in Jaipur after the communal conflict over Babri Masjid. People had fled their homes out of terror. We were about 5000 of us and we organized sadbhavna baithak and other all-religion programmes to restore routine in Rajasthan. We also toured all over India for a special Bharat Yatra to spread positive messages through speeches and cultural shows.A. From 1992, members of our group shifted focus to working for the rights of women, small farmers, backward communities and youth. We would bring in funds by volunteering at construction sites. Later, we joined forces with Vidarbha Lok Vikas Manch under Datta Patil, where I was made responsible for projects for tribals. Since a decade now, weve been working on land resource management. We also started 500 self help groups. Our focus programmes revolve around women empowerment, natural resource management and helping people exercise their rights. Every year, I travel to a state to study their pattern of protest against the government there. This year, I'll be going to Mizoram.A. Yes. For example, BT Brinjal requires much water and fertilizer, making it an unnecessary plant. Science is being used to market vested interests. In school, students are taught that lineseed oil is used as a varnish but not taught how it is a nutritious edible oil. Hence, children never get around accepting it as food. Local resources are the base of our livelihood. Yet, rice and other local vegetables are being made a victim. Manure, medicine and water have been singled out as most important components of farming. We are suffering the impact of green revolution as it has left us with water scarcity and land infertility.Our villages have remained backward because many migrate from urban to rural areas, taking jobs as construction workers or labourers. This has also drained the brains out of the village. The government, on the other hand, prioritizes supply of water first to enterprises, and then farms. The water from Ramtek dam has been sanctioned for Ordnance Factory, while farms in the nearby areas risk drought condition. Land division is also inevitable, and the cause of all malaise is the lack of unity between the farmers.A. We were successful in fighting against the ban on Lakhodi dal by the state government. The dal was not banned in Chhattisgarh and Orissa. The government claimed that 300g consumption of dal daily can cause problems, but no one consumes that amount of dal. In reality, the businesses used to get less money due to abundance of dal production in the farms. Three years ago, the Supreme Court also allowed sale of black salt. The state had made compulsory for all salts to be iodized. Cases in favour of mohua flowers as an edible and sellable ingredient and against growing of soyabean are pending in the high court. Mohua has been blamed endlessly for its liquor but it has many health benefits, whereas soyabean is not native to our land and is not advisable owing to its indigestive qualities."

It started out donating grains and groceries to about 20 to 25 organisations catering to orphans, widows, the homeless and the poor.But over the years, this number of partner organisations grew. Today, we cater to around 170 social organisations across Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune district and Pune city.

That inspired us to start the food bank, said Marlecha. Today, the organisation too visits homes with a container, requesting residents to donate grain.Mahavir Food Bank, which has its office in Bibvewadi, used to receive grains and groceries from 200 people on a regular basis. But storing such huge quantities of grains was a problem. Also, some of them used to be pilfered. So we started doorto-door collection, he said.On Mahavir Jayanti every year, those associated with the food bank organise a rally to collect donations in cash, food grains and other grocery items. With the money collected, we purchase grains and grocery items and distribute them. We also visit orphanages and destitute homes, which rely entirely on government funds  he said.This year, th tion collected lakh and 1,000 groceries on havir Jayant which was cele brated on March 24.We dont collect vegeta bles since the are perishable Rice, dal, jow wheat, bajra grocery items tea, sugar and are also collected.

Both the organisations will be a part of this initiative, he said.Two years ago, during the drought in Maharashtra, the organisation donated groceries to Naam Foundation , an NGO, which works to provide relief to farmers in the barren, droughtprone areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha.The foundation ran an anna chatra (a community kitchen) in Pimpri with the foodgrain. Every day around 500 people t there, Maraid t is the gratde we see in e eyes of hose who do not get even one square meal a day hat keeps us oing.Recently, visited the nment-run or the mute -impaired at Yerawada. We carried packets of chocolates and biscuits with us. The sense of joy among the students was unbelievable. If only all of us could come forward to help, Marlecha said.The food bank now wants to set up a medicine bank, using donations.We plan to collect unused medicines and donate them to the poor, he said."

Publishing the list of beneficiaries will allow for scrutiny to be done by anyone, said a senior government official. The state government has sent a memorandum to the Centre seeking assistance for the losses under the National Disaster Relief Fund, but the assistance is yet to come.As per the state governments primary survey, pink bollworm and other pests last year affected cotton crop on 34 lakh hectares of land as against the total cotton cultivation area of 43 lakh hectares.Many parts of eastern Vidarbha were affected by other pests, which damaged rice and other kharif crops. This prompted the government to increase its coverage of compensation.The state government, however, decided to go ahead and disburse its share in the financial assistance to farmers, instead of waiting for the Centre to release its contribution, said a government official. The funds will be given to district collectors, who will transfer the amount into the accounts of farmers.The beneficiary farmers land records and cultivation crop entries on revenue documents and bank accounts will be verified before the transfer of funds, said the official."

Earlier, they moved around on a bike, but of late, travelled in an Audi to lure buyers.DCP (crime) Bhisham Singh said the two would take turns to wear self-stitched space and anti-radiation suits to pose as Nasa scientists and test the authenticity of the rice puller during the deals with the victims.Last week, TOI had reported about two incidents where they cheated two south Delhi businessmen of Rs 1.43 crore and Rs 39 lakh, respectively. The businessmen were told that Nasa would buy it for Rs 37,500 crore. The matter was reported by one of the victims, Jaheed Ali (36), who told police that the accused posed as representatives of an American firm Rehan Metal USA, which had opened a branch in Karol Bagh. He sold off one of the floors of his building to arrange for the money. After receiving the amount, the gang, which offered him a discount on the machine, soon shut office and disappeared.Simultaneously, another businessman from Lajpat Nagar, who had lost around Rs 1.43 crore, also reported the matter. He was cheated twice by the accused who also made him sign an MoU.The gang was organised. While one posed as a seller, another posed as a potential buyer and tried to compete with the victim to inflate the prices. The crooks told victims that the metal possessed enormous atomic power that could attract rare earth metals from the spot where a thunderbolt strikes the earth, DCP Singh said.Apart from their suits and the Audi, police have recovered a laptop, printer, blank letter heads of a foreign country, cheque books and fake ID cards of Rehan Metals."

While the aravana is sweet and edible, taking a bite of the unniyappam has always been a hard task, literally. Only those with a strong set of teeth would attempt to eat one whole. Not surprisingly, the appam was collectively tagged 'kadicha pottatha appam'.Putting an end to the misery of the devotees, the Travancore Devaswom Board has now given a thumbs up to a few significant changes to the prasadam, so that people can relish it with much devotion.So why were the appams so unyielding, and what is going to change now? A source at the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) says, A main concern of the Devaswom Board was that if they added more banana to the appam, it would lead to rancidity. So they used to fry it to the extent that it became too hard to bite. But now, they have devised a new formula with which it will stay fresh for a minimum of 15 days."" The ingredients, though, would be the same for the appam - rice powder, jaggery, ghee and banana.N Vasu, commissioner, Travancore Devaswom Board says, ""The CFTRI recently visited Sabarimala to study the process, and gave an assurance that they will be adopting newer methods of preparation of the aravana payasam and the unniyappam which will improve their shelf life as well.""And devotees are expectedly overjoyed. Vijay Nair, who has never missed his annual pilgrimage to Sabarimala, is all excited that he can now present the prasadam to people without guilt, and see them bite into it to their heart's content.Meanwhile, the aravana is also going to have a makeover, and the amount of jaggery used has been reduced from 80% to 60%. In terms of the flavour, the result is much better, says the CFTRI source.The changes are expected to be executed from the next pilgrimage season."

Six tonnes of groundnut seeds and a tonne of chilli seeds will also be given to them. Pulses of various kinds have also been ordered; half a tonne of the same will be disbursed.In addition to the new paddy and brinjal varieties, the department is also looking at experimenting with a new moong variant. Though the regular moong varieties grow well in Goan soil and climate, we want bolder seeds that have greater marketability and a bigger grain size, Figueiredo said adding that the pulse may see a path for germination in the next season."

Mandaviya in Patna on Tuesday on the Narendra Modi governments achievements in four years, Paswan said the National Food Security Act, 2013 provided for the revision of the rate after every three years of the 35kg of rationed foodgrains distributed under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana . Though the has not been revised for five years, the Modi government has decided that it will not be increased till June 1 next year , Paswan said, adding around 81 crore PDS beneficiaries of the country would be benefited by this subsidized rate over the next one year.On the steps being taken to streamline the rationing process and reduce pilferages, Paswan said 82% ration cards across the country were linked to Aadhaar and 2.95 lakh PoS machines installed at ration shops. About 2.75 crore fake, duplicate and illegal ration cards have been detected, which all resulted in savings of around Rs 17,500 crore per year.He said the government was also working on the portability of foodgrain entitlements under the PDS so that eligible beneficiaries could get their quota of grains from any ration shop.Paswan said the government would provide 15kg wheat and rice per month to an estimated 1 crore students in all hostels with at least two-thirds of them belonging to SCs, STs and OBCs.Asked about protests over low daal prices in Bihar, Paswan said a committee was being formed to look into the matter. Apparently, a section of farmers are demanding restrictions on import of pulses from other countries to avert a plunge in their prices. Paswan, however, said the government could not stop import of food grains owing to the international norms of the World Trade Organisation. We can only enhance the duty on such items, he said.Union minister of state for road transport and highway Mandaviya, on the other hand, talked about the infrastructure development in the country. The budgetary expenditure of central government for infrastructure development has increased from Rs 1.5 lakh crore under the UPA government to Rs 6 lakh crore now, he said.He said the national highways network in India increased from 92,851km in 2013-14 to 1,20,543km in 2017-18. The rate of construction of national highways also increased from 12km to 27km per day, Mandaviya said."

Research starts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/alternatives-to-stubble-burning-research-starts/articleshow/64502395.cms,2018-06-08,"BATHINDA: Concerned over the impact of stubble burning on the lives of people and impact on the air quality of Delhi, two environment-friendly organisations and researchers have decided to conduct an exhaustive study in Punjab using behaviour change intervention.The six-month research study, Promoting alternatives to burning rice straw management practice in Punjab through behaviour change interventions will be conducted by Hyderabad-based Centre for Sustainable Agriculture and Punjab-based Kheti Virasat Mission (KVM) through scientific methods. The researchers, Max Friedrich from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology and Delhi-based freelancer Bonolata Sen, will carry out the study to know why farmers burn stubble and the scientificallyviable alternatives and how behavioural change interventions could be adopted in containing the trend.The study will be started in the first week of July. The researchers held talks with farmers, agriculture scientists and other stakeholders on Thursday in Bathinda Every year when stubble is burnt in the fields after paddy harvest in November, complaints of air quality turning very poor in Delhi start pouring in. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already asked the governments of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to contain stubble burning by imposing fines on farmers and make alternative arrangements to manage crop residue.The study proposes to understand behaviours related to crop residue burning in Punjab. Why some farmers burn crop residue and why others do not? The study will be designed using the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities and self-regulation (RANAS) approach. Combining leading theories of health behavioural psychology, the RANAS approach postulates that behaviour is primarily driven by peoples mindsets and perceptions, Bonolata told TOI.The design of this research study will be outlined soon after listening to the views of varied sections of society and what do they think about stubble burning, the challenges to address it and the research plan to gather scientific evidence of preferred practices and beliefs related to the issue, said KVM executive director Umendra Dutt."

In the remaining 16 districts, officials hold additional charge of DSO, a post usually given to IAS officers.In September 2017, barely five months after chief secretary Rajbala Verma issued orders for the cancellation of all those ration cards that were not linked with Aadhaar, the state declared it has cancelled over 1.1 million ration cards that were fake/duplicate.Among the five alleged starvation death victims, families of two were denied foodgrain from PDS shops because of problems with biometric authentication of Aadhaar. Another victims family saw its ration card cancelled.The state government denies allegations that starvation caused the five deaths, and attributes them to illnesses. In at least three cases, however, no post-mortem was conducted.The government, though, initiated action in some cases. It suspended two PDS dealers, a health worker, and a marketing officer. PDS dealers work in coordination with marketing officers, who work as associates of DSOs. A DSOs work involves implementing and monitoring the PDS.We asked the personnel department to give us DSOs for all the districts, but they cited a dearth of IAS officers, said state food, public distribution and consumer affairs minister Saryu Rai.Civil society group Right to Food Campaign, which independently probed the causes for the deaths and problems in delivery of ration to the affected families, claims the government has failed to ensure seamless delivery of entitlements to the beneficiaries.Incidentally, the group filed a complaint against chief secretary Verma with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) for her orders to cancel ration cards not linked with Aadhaar.The state has readied its reply to UIDAI. I received a letter from UIDAI regarding the complaint and prepared a probe report. We will share it with UIDAI soon, said state food, public distribution and consumer affairs secretary Amitabh Kaushal. Minister Rai has sought a detailed report on all the cancelled ration cards.The government has repeatedly given strict instructions to provide ration to beneficiaries even if they do not have Aadhaar cards, but problems persist and are often reported from villages in tribal pockets.For instance, the latest starvation death on December 25 was of an elderly woman, Etwariya Devi, in Garhwa district, around 200 km from state capital Ranchi. She died after her family was allegedly denied ration for three months. While the cause of her death could not be ascertained, her family said the local PDS dealer did not give them ration due to failure in biometric authentication. The family is entitled to 25kg of rice per month through their ration card, which is linked with Aadhaar.Etwariyas daughter-in-law Usha Devis fingerprint could not be authenticated in the point of sale (POS) machine, according to Right to Food Campaign activists.The PDS dealer cited poor internet connectivity for failing to authenticate Usha Devis fingerprint, said Siraj Dutta, an activist member from the group."

But for one startup in the Greater Toronto Area, the extreme weather is an opportunity. With adverse weather here, our business model works well. We have four months when other businesses slow down, ours will peak, said Gurmeet Singh, the co-founder of the new company apniroots.com, launched in Toronto in the summer of 2017.Besides online ordering and delivery of Indian groceries covering a large swath of the GTA and the province of Ontario, apniroots.com also sends products via post to customers outside the delivery region.Their website lists Desi staples like rice, atta, dals, pickles, or ready-to-eat South Indian meals like masala dosas, as well as pao bhaji and lassi.New Delhi-born Gurmeet Singh, better known as Gary, saw various factors dictating the need for filling the evident vacuum in this space: Convenient delivery of groceries ordered online.Gurmeet Singh, apniroots co-founder, saw a business opportunity after noticing that Indian stores selling groceries were overpopulated and owners often didnt seem to care about service. (Image courtesy: apniroots.com)The resident of the Toronto suburb of Brampton noticed that Indian stores selling groceries were overpopulated and owners often didnt seem to care about service. Also, mainstream chains like WalMart, Metro or NoFrills have seen increasing shelving of Indian groceries, a pointer to the growing demand, as the Indo-Canadian population in the country nears 1.8 million, of which two-thirds live in Ontario.But they are not able to service very niche items and we have an edge on this, Singh said.New immigrants from India are also often used to the experience of online ordering in metropolitan India, which wasnt really available in Canada. Were filling the gap, he said. In addition, many of these newcomers often dont possess vehicles or have valid licenses, making the task to lugging a 10 pound bag of basmati rice home onerous. Thats one reason the early advertising campaign for apniroots has included displays in transit in Toronto and the GTA.Gurpreet Singh, apniroots co-founder, at the online outlets warehouse in a suburb of Toronto. (Image courtesy: apniroots.com)With Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and Instacart arriving in Canada, Singh believes this space will expand in the near future, and there will be many more Indo-Canadians among the early adopters.Apniroots is part of a trend and the first end-to-end platform of its kind in Canada with an extensive inventory, though smaller outlets, often extensions of brick-and-mortar stores, have also brought the online shopping experience to groceries in Canada, emulating what is already established in neighbouring US.Singh said their product range was in the thousands and they had acquired hundreds of thousands of customers, though he would not give details as the startup looks for funding to expand.The range available with apniroots is stored in a warehouse in Brampton and obtained from importers specialising in Desi items. But grocery shopping may be the starting point for them since Singh said they were in the process of launching jewelry, clothing, items for pujas, among other new offering, on the platform.Singh estimated that groceries accounted for nearly 60% of the household budget of an Indo-Canadian family. The market potential is there. This was an experiment and we have learnt a lot. Now we know where we are going, Singh said.For now, apniroots and its cousins offer Indo-Canadians another option for their next purchase of besan or even Maggi noodles."
