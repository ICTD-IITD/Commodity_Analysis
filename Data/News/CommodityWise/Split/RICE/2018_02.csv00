We do not celebrate Lohri as a harvest festival. We celebrate our trade, share the goods we trade  mainly silverware, cloth and cutlery, says Sudhir Khanna, 76, president of the Shri Multan Seva Samiti.Lohri is celebrated across northern India with feasts of sarson ka saag, puffed rice and sweetmeats of sesame, jaggery and groundnut. Multan is an arid region; we dont traditionally have a lot of vegetables. So our special Lohri food is a spicy mix of seven vegetables  a rare treat, says Mahesh Nagpal, 75, secretary of the Samiti. We also feast on sugarcane juice.A large bonfire is lit and celebrants walk around it thrice, chanting and making offerings of gulal to their deity, Narsimha, a part-man-part-lion incarnation of the Hindu deity Vishnu.There is one Multani priest in Mumbai, who knows each of the families of the 1,000 Multanis in the city.The culture lives on through the priest and the elderly. Most youngsters call themselves Punjabi, although our culture is different, adds Nagpal. Nishant Chawla, 25, a public relations executive, says, I tell people Im Punjabi. My family doesnt speak the language at all.A monthly community bulletin with details of events and recipes keeps them united, and helps with match-making."

Drihata Phukan, a resident of Delhi, says, We may not light a meji (bonfire) because we want to keep our Bihu celebration as eco-friendly as possible. We will light lamps instead. Also, rather than celebrating individually, we will opt for a group party, and our folk dance, Bihu dance, and play party games.Many folks like Neel Saikia are heading to Gurgaon to indulge in Bihu festivities. Saikia, a lawyer by profession, explaining why the festival is called Magh/Bhogali Bihu, says, It is called Magh because its observed in the Assamese month of Magh, and Bhogali comes from the word bhog, which means feasting.With different varieties of pithas (sweet and savoury snacks), ladoos and jolpaans (jalpaan) at the venue, the Assam Association, Gurgaon is set for Bihu. It has also arranged for a traditional meji followed by pitha-pona (rice based sweet) competition among other interesting things.These pithas, ladoos and jolpaans are shared with everyone who visits the celebration. It will continue with fun games, dance and music. The free-for-all event that has been popular among Gurgaonites since 2006 will be organised at Huda Community Centre, Sector 47, Gurgaon, today. Prabhakar Dutta, general secretary, Assam Association (Gurgaon), says, A lot of people who are not even from Assam love to participate in the festivities.Traditionally, on the eve of the Bihu, young men gather wood to construct meji and bhela-ghar (a makeshift cottage built with bamboo and dried rice stalks) in nearby fields or open areas. A community feast is then held on the Uruka eve, and dishes are prepared and feasted upon in front of the bhela-ghar. The morning after, the meji and the bhela-ghar are set on fire, and people offer prayers to the God of Fire.

Under the project, the government will procure the traditional rice varieties at premium prices from them and will also set up a facility to process and market the rice. We have earmarked Rs 3 crore for the purpose this fiscal,"" agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar said.He added that steps are underway to take GI registration for five more rice varieties native to Wayanad.Many of these rice varieties are highly resilient against climate- change and are highly stress-tolerant apart from having aromatic and medicinal properties. Wayanad used to have highly diverse rice varieties numbering around 105, which have now reduced to around 40, out of which less than 10 are now extensively cultivated.To set the ground for the rice conservation programme, 52 students from the College of Agriculture, Padannakkad, along with officials of the department, will conduct a survey to identify and document the rice varieties and cultivation practices from February 15 to 20. They will collect specific details, including the nutritional value, size, and colour of the varieties and pest resistance qualities if any.A directory of farmers engaged in the cultivation of indigenous rice varieties will be published and their cultivation practices will be documented.Principal agricultural officer P H Meherban said currently speciality varieties, including the scented Jeerakashala, Gandhakashala and medicinal rice variety of Njavara are being cultivated in 390 hectares by farmers and the government had provided Rs 39 lakh to them last fiscal. ""Now, we have proposed to extend the financial incentive of Rs 10,000 per hectare to farmers cultivating the traditional rice varieties,"" she added.Dr P Rajendran, associate director of research at Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS) at Ambalavayal in Wayanad said tribal farmers of Wayanad, especially belonging to the Kurichiya and Kuruma tharavadus, have been the custodians of valuable rice gene pools which they have been conserving despite all odds.National award-winning tribal farmer Cheruvayal Raman who conserves around 35 rare rice varieties in his 1.5 acre field said he was incurring a loss of around Rs 50,000 every paddy season.""We know that if we stop farming, these native varieties will be lost forever. The government's decision to implement a special scheme to support farming of traditional rice varieties would help preserve the remaining varieties for the next generation,"" he added."

Bundles of notes and diaries are found. What is this if not seedha rupaiya sarkar? This government should not be allowed to continue for a single minute, he added.Modi also attacked the government for not using central funds and said all the money released by the Centre was making its way to Congress party functionaries. Every person is angry with it (the state government). This is probably the most anger any government has faced, Modi said.On the occasion, the BJP also launched a new programme called the Mushti Dhanya Abhiyana, under which a fistful of rice will be collected from farmers and a feast will be held at the taluk level for their families.As the PM launched a blistering attack on Siddaramaiah and the Karnataka government over corruption, Randeep Singh Surjewala, communications chief of the Congress, hit back at the BJP over the PNB fraud.Who is responsible for this public loot of money? We want to ask the PM on behalf of the country to break his maun vrat, to break his silence and speak out, answer questions of the people of the country, he told at a press conference in Bengaluru.State law minister TB Jayachandra also criticised PMs choice of words.This is a baseless, clueless allegation, he said."

In about two decades, out of 120-odd rice mills, only 20 are functional today and they primarily produce puffed rice.Kanti Makwana, director of Bavla-based NGO Dharti Charitable Trust , said that the region also had cultivation of red rice (locally known as vari chokha) along with about six other variants of paddy.We also used to spot greenish rice which used to grow on its own in waterlogged areas around the farms. Now that unique crop is gone as are traditional crops, locally known as cheno, banti and kodri. The crops are getting more and more homogenized, he said.As the world will mark 25 years of Convention on Biodiversity on May 22, for Ahmedabad district, the day brings in a few joys and more worries. Organizations such as Dharti Charitable Trust have been charting the biodiversity of the region through Peoples Biodiversity Register ( PBR ), a project initiated by National Biodiversity Authority and local biodiversity boards.A K Shrivastav, chairman of Gujarat State Biodiversity Board (GSBB), said that the state comes second nationally in preparing PBRs with 1,164 registers prepared so far. Work on 600 more is in the pipeline.Our purpose is to evoke sense of ownership among the local residents and also to tap into traditional knowledge. Agricultural biodiversity is an important component, he said.The outcome of PBRs, however, is not clear. Sanju Sharma, state consultant, GSBB, said that PBRs are classified documents and thus they cannot reveal the data on crops, plants, animals, reptiles and so on which are recorded under the project. GSBB website mentions Gujarat to be home of 4,320 species of flora and 3,054 species of fauna but the data does not have any date specification.The entire ecosystem is delicately balanced. Loss of one component  be it animal, bird or vegetation  makes a major difference. On the basis of conversation with the local elders, we mapped the parts of Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Gir-Somnath, Kheda and Morbi districts and got to know that flora and fauna that used to be visible two decades ago has now gone extinct or is difficult to spot, said Makwana. His organization has so far prepared 67 PBRs in these regions.(With inputs from Himanshu Kaushik)"

The participants took a pledge to preserve organic and natural farming practices, besides conserving the environment.The festival was organised by Nel R Jayaraman , who has revived around 170 traditional paddy varieties as part of the Save our Rice (SoR) Campaign aimed at conserving traditional varieties of paddy. Traditional paddy varieties such as Karun kuruvai, Neeladi Samba and Maappillai Samba besides herbs, agriculture equipment and traditional food varieties, green manure, guides as well as manuals for organic farming have been exhibited too.

Goas brinjal biodiversity is rich and adequately resistant to food borer. The governments intervention helped stall the move.At that stage, Goas scientific community was cautious in recommending trials on Bt brinjal out of apprehensions over possible transfer of the gene to other brinjal varieties and also other crops of solanatius family, Jose R Faleiro, a former entomologist, Indian council of agricultural research (ICAR) said.The storm over commercial exploitation of bio-resources blew over for the moment. But people are wary about the threat of bio-piracy.The farmers may share the seeds of unique varieties and traditional knowledge with others unknowingly for its commercial use, an official said.The piracy deprives them and communities of fair and equitable sharing of benefits of bio-resources.Yet another International Biological Diversity Day on May 22 brings to the fore the slow bio-conservation process. The biodiversity management committees (BMCs) of all panchayats will have to work with dedication to document what is left in their villages, says Sachin Tendulkar, an agricultural professional.The Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) was formed more than a decade ago, but has achieved a modicum of success in motivating the BMCs documentation effort in their villages. In order to ensure documentation of tradable bio-resources and other aspects, the board has appointed nine support groups comprising experts and assisted BMCs in mapping bio-resources, Pradip Sarmokadam, member secretary, GSBB said.Over the years, the mistake of introducing improved crop varieties, including rice varieties with an aim of higher production is being realized belatedly.The green revolution prompted farmers to dump traditional ones as their yield was less, Tendulkar said.Previously, this knowledge was being transmitted orally since the hoary past, but now scientific documentation will help in legitimate conservation.The main benefit of documentation is protection for bio-resources, heritage sites and other bio-wealth, as it is being massacred by development activities now, Nitin Borkar, an environmentalist."

A team of researchers from the University of Edinburgh found that Indias self-sufficiency model for securing food, which relies on increases in domestic crop yield and reduction of waste will be insufficient to meet United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by 2030. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh play a key role in Indias food production. Both the Telugu states have been recording bumper yields. While Telangana is the seed capital of India, AP with Krishna and Godavari delta systems is considered the rice bowl.A combined approach of optimising domestic production and increasing global trade links could enable India to meet the UN goal of zero hunger by 2030, the study found.Researchers from the University of Edinburgh found that closing the gap between Indias food supplies and its population growth will require a combination of measures.An official statement from the University of Edinburgh said, a nationwide programme to optimise crop selection is needed to maximise the production and supply of dietary energy, protein and micronutrients. India may also need to increase its international agricultural trade and lift restrictions on food imports to diversify, improve and safeguard food supplies.Researchers analysed domestic capacity of Indias food system and made projections for 2030 and 2050. The official statement said the research maps the entire Indian food system for the first time, from crop production to household availability, studying levels of calories, protein, fat and micronutrients.Researchers found an increase in population coupled with environmental and dietary pressures could lead to nutritional shortages across 60% of Indian population. More than two billion people globally suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, and nearly half of them live in India."

With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), Alberto was crawling north at 10 mph (17 kph) as it began taking aim at the Southeast.Authorities did not immediately attribute any deaths or injuries directly to Alberto. But in North Carolina, a television news anchor and a photojournalist were killed Monday when a tree that had been uprooted from rain-soaked ground toppled on a TV vehicle as the two reported on severe weather on the fringes of the huge system, hundreds of miles (kilometres) from Alberto's center. WYFF-TV of Greenville, South Carolina, said a news anchor, Mike McCormick, and photojournalist, Aaron Smeltzer, with that station were both killed.McCormick and Smeltzer had just interviewed Tryon Fire Chief Geoffrey Tennant as they covered storms in North Carolina.""Ten minutes later we get the call and it was them,"" Tennant said at a news conference, his voice cracking.Tennant did not directly blame the up to 2 inches (5 centimetres) of rain that fell Monday from the fringes of Alberto for the deaths. He said the roots of a large tree that toppled on the vehicle came loose from ground saturated by a week's worth of earlier rain.The men died instantly, their TV vehicle's engine still running, Tennant said.More rain is on the way. Between four and eight inches (10-25 centimetres) of rain could soak the Florida Panhandle, Alabama, and western Georgia before the storm moves on. Isolated deluges of 12 inches (30 centimetres) also are possible.Forecasters said Alberto could then become a subtropical depression during the night before spreading rains Tuesday over the Tennessee Valley and later in the week around the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region.Meanwhile, potentially life-threatening rough surf and rip currents continued on the northern Gulf Coast after Alberto rolled up big waves and tides along the coast. Lifeguards posted red flags along the white sands of Pensacola Beach, where swimming and wading were banned as Alberto disrupted long holiday weekend plans for millions.The storm forced some Memorial Day tributes to be cancelled across Florida's Panhandle. Safety was the priority, but the decision was still a ""heartbreaker,"" said Tom Rice, a 29-year-old Army veteran who leads the organisations that had planned a ceremony Monday at Beal Memorial Cemetrey in Fort Walton Beach.Some stragglers still made their way through the rain to pay tribute at the cemetery's Veterans Tribute Tower, however. Rice said American flags had been placed Saturday on the graves of all 1,700 veterans buried in the cemetery.""We got the flags out,"" Rice told the Northwest Florida Daily News as wind whipped a massive US flag flying at half-staff. ""That's what's important.""Along the Florida Panhandle, tourists vowed Alberto wouldn't dampen their vacations.Jason Powell sought to keep his children entertained with movies and TV until Alberto blows past his pristine Florida vacation spot.""So far we've seen a lot of wind and the ocean is really high, covering up the entire beach,"" Powell said.Janet Rhumes said her group of friends from Kansas had been planning their Memorial Day weekend on Navarre Beach since October. They stocked up on groceries and settled in for card games. ""We've never seen one before and we're here celebrating a friend's 20th birthday,"" Rhumes told the Daily News. ""So how often can you say you rode a storm out?""Elsewhere, Florida's Division of Emergency Management said, about 2,600 customers were without power for a time in northwestern Florida on Monday.As Alberto's center heads inland it is being deprived of the warm waters that fuel tropical weather systems, causing it to weaken, forecasters said.

This resulted in annual expenses falling to 3,695 crore from 4,320 crore during the period.The state government offers a uniform monthly pension of 1,000 under nine categories - with the support of Centre in three schemes - to all vulnerable sections, such as differently-abled, widows, agricultural labourers, poor farmers, deserted wives, unmarried woman of the age of 50 years and above and who are destitute and poor, besides Sri Lankan refugees.A performance budget tabled by the social welfare department on the floor of assembly did not give out the reasons, but the implementing officials say the ""continuous monitoring"" of scheme in the last few years weeded out ineligible persons running into lakhs. Besides pension, the beneficiaries get free rice and dhoties and sarees While funding comes from social welfare, the social security pension schemes are implemented by the revenue department with the assistance from national and commercial banks. Centre sponsors 200 and 500 per person for three schemes. Revenue minister R B Udayakumar pointed to multiple factors for large-scale elimination. ""Linking of Aadhaar number is one crucial element to bring down the number of eligible pensioners. We have made 99% Aadhaar entries and identified duplication in the database,"" the minister told TOI.Development of new software has also come in handy to weed out the deaths and double entries, against the backdrop of migration and reaping the benefits in both ends, Udayakumar said. The social security pensioners are not required for ""annual life certification"" exercise as is done in the case of the pensioners and family pensioners of government service, and therefore the deaths are not reported timely to the executing agency for cancellation of pension. Tindivanam MLA P Seethapathy said that eligible beneficiaries, whose pension abruptly ended, were reaching out to monthly ""Amma"" camps in huge numbers, seeking pension. ""Let the scrutiny take place properly,"" the member told the assembly.The revenue administration officials say the deletions were made after tightening the linkages between authorities sanctioning the pension and death registrars. ""While local village administrative officers must report to the tahsildars who releases pension, the major problem was lying in urban areas, where local bodies oversee birth and death registry. That has now been bridged,"" the officer said."

Almost 50% of the vegetables and herbs we consume come from our backyard, said Amin. Organic farming does need time and super- vision but it is worth it as we know that we are consuming natural food, he said. From broccoli , cabbage and brinjals to lettuce, the Amins grow a lot of organic produce apart from herbs. We grow organic wheat and rice in our farm at Mogur in Anand, said Amins wife Tejal. Prachi Agrawal, took to organic farming just a year ago. We buy fresh vegetables from the market but we know that they are pesticide ridden.

Stating that the spirit of Wuhan ""underpinned"" the Qingdao meeting, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale called Xi's acceptance of Modi's invite for another informal summit in 2019 in India as a significant takeaway from the meeting on Saturday.Another significant development was that Modi and Xi agreed to identify a project in ""capacity building"" in Afghanistan on which the two countries can work together. The idea that the two countries can work together in Afghanistan on economic projects had originated in the Wuhan summit. Significantly for India, China also agreed to renew an agreement which calls for sharing of hydrological data of the Brahmaputra river in flood season (from May 15 to October 15) with India.Modi and Xi, who have met on more than a dozen occasions in the past four years, have been for some time trying to rise above the historical and policy trappings that has held India-China relations in an unsettled state for decades. The announcement about Xi's visit is seen as a signal to the people of India and China that the two leaders have finally agreed on a plan to resolve past disputes to the extent possible.A plan is afoot to create a mechanism at the level of the two leaders to provide strategic guidance to the two militaries to keep peace on the border and take forward connectivity projects in third countries, starting in Afghanistan.The signal came on the sidelines of the SCO summit, which is being attended by Pakistan's President Mamnoon Hussain. The decision to take forward the system of informal summits is a message to Pakistan as well because Islamabad has been counting on India's support in its disputes with India.India and China also signed two bilateral agreements on continuing the sharing of hydrological data on the Brahmaputra river and on expanding rice exports to China.During his meeting with Xi, the Prime Minister highlighted the negative balance of trade arrangement for India and expressed the hope that China would buy a range of products like rice, sugar and pharmaceuticals from India. The decision on rice exports could be a starting point for sale of Indian farm produce and processed products like sugar to China in order to reduce the trade imbalance.Under an MoU between China's ministry of water resources and India's ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, China has agreed to share flood season data with India from May 15 to October 15 every year. Data was not shared last year, with China citing landslides in Tibet and amid strained ties during the Doklam stand-off. China has now pledged to share data with India during the flood season, and to also provide data if the water levels exceed mutually agreed levels during the non-flood season.China's customs administration and India's department of agriculture on rice exports will enable India to now export non-basmati rice varieties, expanding an earlier 2006 protocol on rice exports. China's ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui said on Twitter that Saturday's meeting will discuss the blueprint of relations going forward and also the consensus reached in Wuhan last month."

It was noted that till date banks had barely met 25% of crop loan target. The minister warned banks found lax in providing loans to farmers who had already cleared old loans after availing waiver scheme would face action as per RBI guidelines.It was decided to keep a strict check so that illegal herbivore resistant genetically modified seeds did not enter market. Such seeds are smuggled from Telangana and Gujarat . These seeds had caused a havoc in cotton belt last year leading to crop losses and deaths caused by pesticide fumes inhalation of high-vegetating plant variety.The meeting started with homage to state agriculture minister Pandurang Phundkar who died recently and also to rice innovator Dadaji Khobragade. Khot also exhorted agriculture officials from top to last rung to visit farms regularly during the season and extend all possible help to farmers.

He returned to find his home and shop both destroyed.""Ramadan used to be the best time of year for business. Now I have no source of revenue and have to survive on charity,"" he said.While families wait for the launch of the city's reconstruction and assistance to help them get back on their feet, the ""Moslawis"" have revived another tradition: long tables set up on the streets to feed the poor.""It's a beautiful initiative and typical of the people of Mosul who are known for their sense of solidarity, especially in hard times,"" said 45 year old Umm Mahmud.Thanks to the donations, she was able to serve her children a full meal of chicken, rice and orange juice at a table in the city's Bab Lakash district."

Though the puncha land is around 990 acres, only 550 acres were brought under paddy cultivation last fiscal.We have harvested around 1,500 metric tonnes of paddy. In the first phase,we are planning to sell around 20 tonnes of rice. Next month, another 20 tonnes would reach the market.We are planning to sell it through the existing outlets of the agriculture department with the support of Keecheri Service Cooperativebank.On June10, agriculture minister V S Sunilkumar will officially launch the Thottara brand at a function to be held at Amballoor panchayat, said Sujith Karun , district coordinator, Haritha Keralam Mission.Thottarapuncha, once considered as the rice bowl of Ernakulam, had been lying barren for more than a decade.

5b2030159855b70ae8cac669,Nitrogen emissions going up: study,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nitrogen-emissions-going-up-study/article24091626.ece,2018-06-06,"Nitrogen particles make up the largest fraction of PM2.5, the class of pollutants closely linked to cardiovascular and respiratory illness, says the first-ever quantitative assessment of nitrogen pollution in India.While the burning of crop residue is said to be a key contributor to winter smog in many parts of North India, it contributes over 240 million kg of nitrogen oxides (NOx: a generic term for the nitrogen oxides that are most relevant for air pollution, namely nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) and about 7 million kg of nitrous oxide (N2O) per year.The Indian Nitrogen Assessment assesses the sources, impacts, trends and future scenarios of reactive nitrogen in the Indian environment, says N. Raghuram, Dean, School of Biotechnology, GGS Indraprastha University, who is one of the authors of the report.Though agriculture remains the largest contributor to nitrogen emissions, the non-agricultural emissions of nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide are growing rapidly, with sewage and fossil-fuel burning  for power, transport and industry  leading the trend.Indian NOx emissions grew at 52% from 1991 to 2001 and 69% from 2001 to 2011.Annual NOx emissions from coal, diesel and other fuel combustion sources are growing at 6.5% a year currently, the report says.As fertilizer, nitrogen is one of the main inputs for agriculture, but inefficiencies along the food chain mean about 80% of nitrogen is wasted, contributing to air and water pollution plus greenhouse gas emissions, thereby causing threats for human health, ecosystems and livelihoods, Dr. Raghuram said at a conference to mark World Environment Day.Agricultural soils contributed to over 70% of N2O emissions from India in 2010, followed by waste water (12%) and residential and commercial activities (6%). Since 2002, N2O has replaced methane as the second largest Greenhouse Gas (GHG) from Indian agriculture.Chemical fertilizers (over 82% of it is urea) account for over 77% of all agricultural N2O emissions in India, while manure, compost and so on make up the rest. Most of the fertilizers consumed (over 70%) go into the production of cereals, especially rice and wheat, which accounts for the bulk of N2O emissions from India.Cattle emissionsCattle account for 80% of the ammonia production, though their annual growth rate is 1%, due to a stable population.India is globally the biggest source of ammonia emission, nearly double that of NOx emissions.But at the current rate of growth, NOx emissions will exceed ammonia emissions and touch 8.8 tonnes by 2055, the report says.The poultry industry, on the other hand, with an annual growth rate of 6%, recorded an excretion of reactive nitrogen compounds of 0.415 tonnes in 2016.That is anticipated to increase to 1.089 tonnes by 2030.The authors suggest that nutrient recovery/recycling from waste water for agriculture could cut down N2O emissions from sewage and waste water by up to 40%."

Nine hectares will come under ladies finger cultivation and 30 hectares under cowpea. There will also be five hectares under amaranthus and other leafy vegetables for the season. Bittergourd will be cultivated in 11 hectares and 30 hectares will come under other gourds.Poultry enterpriseMeanwhile, 120 broiler chicken farms have started functioning in the district under the Kudumbasree Mission.The district has the largest number of poultry units. There are 515 poultry farms functioning under the Mission in the State.The poultry initiative was launched in the background of serious fluctuations in the price of poultry in the State. It was launched in collaboration with Kerala State Poultry Development Corporation, Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University as well as the Animal Husbandry Department. The aim of the programme is to make safe and competitively priced poultry available in the State."

It has evolved to include an obligation for state parties to respect, protect, and fulfil their citizens right to food security. Our current understanding of food security includes the four dimensions of access, availability, utilisation and stability. As a state party to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, India has the obligation to ensure the right to be free from hunger and the right to adequate food.From availability to accessBroadly speaking, attitudes towards food security in India can be divided into two generations subsequent to Independence. While the demarcation is far from exact, it indicates how the importance given to different elements of food security altered over time.The years post-Independence were turbulent for India. Memories of the Bengal famine remained fresh and fears of a food shortage were rampant. Hunger was thought to be a function of inadequate food production. In 1974, the World Food Conference defined food security primarily in terms of production  as the availability at all times of adequate world food supplies.It is arguable that the framing of food security in quantitative terms sparked Indias determination to initiate the Green Revolution to boost food production. While the programme achieved dramatic increases in rice and wheat production in some parts of the country, its devastating environmental impact has also rightly been critiqued.Two occurrences over the 1980s and 1990s set the stage for what we understand as food security in India today. The first was when the Supreme Court dramatically expanded the ambit of rights that citizens could claim against the state. While no explicit right to food could be made out, there was an increased mention of food as being among a cluster of basic rights integral to human dignity. The second was a shift of the frame from the problem of availability to the problem of access.The 1980s and 1990s saw an increasing acknowledgement that Indias focus on increasing food supplies was falling short of actually ameliorating hunger. Even as the data showed that India had transformed from a food deficit nation to a food surplus one, seminal research by Amartya Sen and others revealed that hunger and food security were tied to the issue of access  that is, in spite of ample quantities of grain, and a variety of government efforts such as the Public Distribution System, people were dying of starvation because they were unable to physically or financially (or both) reach this food. This view of food security was mirrored at an international level too. In 1996, the World Food Summit stated that food security was achieved when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food.This focus on access culminated in India in a 2001 case brought by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, in which the Supreme Court evolved a right to food and read it into the right to life provisions of the Constitution. Following that, a host of court orders and directions ultimately resulted in the 2013 National Food Security Act (NFSA), which has been lauded for guaranteeing a quantitative right to food to all Indians. However, the NFSA suffers from serious lacunae in its drafting, which severely undermine its stated objective of giving legal form to the right to food in India.Assessing the Food Security ActThe NFSA surprisingly does not guarantee a universal right to food. Instead, it limits the right to food to those identified on the basis of certain criteria. It then goes on to further restrict the right to 75% of the Indian population. It also specifies that a claim under the Act would not be available in times of war, flood, drought, fire, cyclone or earthquake (notably, it is within the Central governments remit to declare whether such an occassion has arisen). Given that a right to food becomes most valuable in exactly these circumstances, it is questionable whether the Act is effective in guaranteeing the right that it is meant to.Another problematic aspect of the NFSA is its embrace of certain objectives that are to be progressively realised. These provisions include agrarian reforms, public health and sanitation, and decentralised procurement, but they make no mention of the need to reconsider fundamental assumptions about our agricultural systems and look at food security in a more comprehensive manner. It is arguable that the rubric of progressive realisation actually retards food security reform in the country. This is because some of the elements mentioned under this head are already incorporated in laws and policies at the State and national levels. Demarcating them as obligations to be realised progressively will lead to counter-intuitive results where the States will simply refrain from doing any more than what the NFSA explicitly requires them to do.Worryingly, the framing of the NFSA as being the final word on government commitments to provide food security to citizens might instead have the result of limiting the courts with respect to how far citizen entitlements can be extended. This fear was borne out in the recent Swaraj Abhiyan cases that address the impact of government failures in tackling consecutive drought years in India. While the court took a strong stance in ordering the executive to implement the provisions of the NFSA, it was reluctant to go beyond the provisions of the NFSA in terms of what it could order the government to give citizens. Given that the NFSA predominantly mentions just rice and wheat, and that too for only some citizens, this has worrying implications.Finally, while the NFSA addresses issues of access, availability and, even tangentially, utilisation, it is largely silent on the issue of stability of food supplies  a startling omission given Indias vulnerability to climate change impacts, to name one impending threat to food security.Thus there is a need to frame a third generation food security law and recognise and mainstream issues including increasing natural disasters and climate adaptation. Such a framework would robustly address the challenges facing the countrys food security across all four dimensions and make a coordinated effort to resolve them instead of the piecemeal efforts that have characterised such attempts so far.Food security brings together diverse issues such as inequality, food diversity, indigenous rights and environmental justice. Given the current crises in India, it is time we prepare a third generation right to food legislation that recognises that a climate-as-usual scenario no longer exists. Such a legislation would ideally be rooted in the principle of a right to food security in its true spirit and not merely as a sound bite.Shalini Iyengar is faculty with School of Law, Environment and Planning at Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology, Bengaluru, and Balakrishna Pisupati is Chairperson, Forum for Law, Environment, Development and Governance"

The first meeting on the issue was held last week.Counting the unchanged price since the Narendra Modi government took over as one of his Ministrys achievements, Mr. Paswan said: The food subsidy has increased by 26% since 2014. And the Centre is bearing the bulk of the subsidy bill with very few States contributing to it. He was addressing a press conference to mark four years of the NDA government. The Ministry claims to have achieved 100% digitisation of ration cards, 83% Aadhar seeding and 60% of automation of fair price shops.The Opposition has criticised the BJP government for cutting corners on the Food Security Act. The CPI (M), in its report card on the governments performance, has said that the digitisation and Aadhar linking of ration cards had deprived many rightful beneficiaries. We do not have any plans to amend the Food Security Act, Mr. Paswan asserted."

5b2046d59855b70ae8cad01c,Poachers play deadly ivory game in Kerala,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poachers-play-deadly-ivory-game-in-kerala/article24125837.ece,2018-06-10,"On March 29, 2018, another undercover operation led to the seizure of ivory figurines from wildlife traffickers operating in Paruthipally range in Thiruvananthapuram. An investigator said their shine indicated that the statuettes of Hindu gods had been carved recently from fresh tusks.It seemed that after a lull of two years, once again, there was a growing market for magic cures while ivory artefacts also witnessed renewed demand. Since January 2017, forest officers say they have seized more than 50 kg of ivory from traffickers in Kerala. Yet, the provenance of much of the impounded ivory remained unknown. Investigations often hit a dead-end because forest officers, dreading departmental action, were loath to admit wild elephant killings in their jurisdiction.To dodge departmental enquiries, some incorrectly certified that the tusks were from elephants that had died due to natural causes. In 2017, at least three carcasses of wild elephants were discovered by chance in Chithalathu, Nagaranpara and Pariyaram in Wayanad, Kottayam and Thrissur districts respectively.The post-mortem examinations on the decomposed bodies were inconclusive. They were found disintegrated and in at least one case burned, possibly in a forest fire or by wildlife traffickers themselves.Officials say that elephants are vulnerable to poaching in at least 20 forest localities in the State, especially during monsoon. The areas also include forests contiguous to Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.A review conducted by Chief Conservator, Dr. B. S Corrie after the killing of at least a score of wild elephants in Malayattoor, Vazhachal and Munnar forest divisions in 2014-15 helped the forest department map the poorly protected sites.The slaughter of at least 18 tuskers for their ivory in the deep forests had come to light when one of the gang members, a forest watcher who moonlighted as a guide for the poachers, had a change of heart and disclosed the killings.Operation ShikkarK. D. Kunjumons confession on May 21, 2015, to officers in Athirapally forest range had prompted Operation Shikkar, that resulted in the seizure of 464 kg of ivory and the arrest of 73 persons. The probe that unfolded across the country revealed how poachers shot elephants dead on order, hacked their tusks with camp axes and delivered the ivory to Thiruvananthapuram-based middle-men.Thiruvananthapuram is the hub of ivory trade in South India because of its vast pool of traditional artisans who are adept at carving wood, animal bone and also ivory. Traffickers offer them higher wages than what they get for working on wood or camel bone.Operation Shikkar relied heavily on the personal journal of an ivory trafficker targeted a secret warehouse in New Delhi, which had operated under cover of a handicrafts shop.It showed how the poachers led by Aikkaramattom Vasu alias Varattupara Veerappan  a sobriquet the hunter earned for his skilled shooting with locally made muzzle loaders  remained off the forest departments radar for years and ranged freely in dense forests, killing tuskers. It also led to the seizure of 28 guns hidden in forest locations.In the thick of woodsVasus method was to camp in the forest for days with few aides. They survived mostly on dried rice balls to avoid lighting fires. Vasu enlisted the help of tribals and corrupt forest watchers to shoot tuskers. He was then found dead, hanging in a remote pineapple farm in Sindhudurgh district in Maharashtra in 2015, and thereafter ivory seizures dwindled with his collaborators on the run.However, now officials fear that front-persons of Thiruvananthapuram-based ivory traders have recommenced their operations.Officials say the accused have now shifted their operations to Kolkata. Now, a woman from Thiruvananthapuram, who goes by the moniker Calcutta Thankachi heads the illegal operations.She has hired artisans from Thiruvananthapuram to carve ivory and accommodated them in West Bengal. Investigators say that she along with her Mumbai-based associate, who goes by the name Pi Mundi are responsible for the resurgence of the ivory trade.Officers say they have partly responded to the threat by identifying and naming big herds and counting them in their home range with particular emphasis on photographing and documenting tuskers.They also have suggested equipping forest watchers with GPS to track their movements, and placing camera traps and other remote sensors to deter poachers."

People will take out marches to see me off to the open jail... Entire police force will be require to control the crowd, he said.When the judge said the court would direct the government to prevent people from taking out marches, Prasad said: In such a situation, mass killings could take place.The RJD chief also urged the judge to refer to a government circular that prohibits keeping any convict sentenced to less than five years of imprisonment in an open jail.Dahi-chura for Lalu during SankrantiSpecial CBI judge Shivpal Singh assured RJD chief Lalu Prasad that he would order the jail administration to provide him curd and rice flakes on January 14, the Makar Sankranti day.Prasad had earlier told the judge that he had sent him to jail ahead of the festival, thus denying him dahi and chura."

The shows at Hanois Thang Long theatre have become a staple on the well-trodden tourist circuit and draw thousands every week, including many first-time viewers.Vietnam is the birthplace of the centuries-old art form that emerged in the northern rice paddies as entertainment for farmers. The earliest record of the performances is on a 12th century stele that still stands at a pagoda in northern Ha Nam province, but historians say water puppetry likely originated even earlier. Despite its ancient roots  or perhaps because of them  the shows draw little attention from local Vietnamese viewers, especially millennials.Yet as interest wanes at home, there are signs water puppetry may be gaining traction abroad. Canadian director Robert Lepage returned to Toronto this year with an adaptation of Stravinskys opera The Nightingale, in which the orchestra pit was transformed into a pool of water for singers-come-puppeteers commanding marionettes.For Pham Dinh Viem, a third-generation puppet carver, such innovative approaches may be the secret to reviving the centuries-old tradition among locals. If the script and the performance dont change, its impossible to serve the audience in the long-term, he said."

Later, friends from Noida and local volunteers joined him in his mission to ensure hygienic menstrual practices in far flung villages of tribal-dominated Jharkhand.Jhas crusade reflects a similar effort in far-off Tamil Nadu, where activist Arunachalam Muruganantham ran a mission to provide sanitary napkins to poor rural women. A Bollywood biopic on Muruganantham, starring Akshay Kumar, is set for release next year but the films title, Padman, has already stuck on Jha.People now call him the Padman of Jharkhand, and for good reason. An increasing number of women are switching to pads, handed out mostly by him.Its been over a year now that Jha is visiting villages every week and distributing free sanitary pads for to the largely illiterate rural women. He has succeeded in persuading women in more than 600 households in villages near Ranchi to adopt sanitary napkins.MAN ON A MISSION Mangesh Jha, 29, runs an independent campaign in six remote villages of JharkhandWomen call him Mangru Dada, or elder brotherJha plans to set up a sanitary pad manufacturing unit in a village to provide affordable napkins to womenNearly 600 rural tribal households in the state have been given sanitary padsRaso Devi, a health worker in her mid-40s, said women in her village were initially reluctant to talk to Jha as menstruation is seldom discussed openly. But they shed their inhibitions gradually.The work he has been doing is commendable. Who thinks about the ordeals of village women these days? He is like a fellow villager for us, she said.Jha isnt associated with any NGO, and relies solely on his earnings from a Ramakrishna Mission centre and donations from well-wishers to fund his independent initiative.I only see myself as a conscious citizen of the country, willing to walk the extra mile for rural citizens. Anybody can do this work. There is no rocket science involved, he said.He is also a youth fellow at Unnat Bharat, working with the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in Ranchi to develop the backward Gatarpo panchayat in Lohardaga, one of the 21 Maoist-affected districts in Jharkhand.I know distribution of sanitary pads cannot serve the larger purpose of making it a habit in rural areas. I am planning to set up a small manufacturing unit in a village to provide inexpensive pads to women, he said.He can probably turn to the Padman of India, Muruganantham, who has built a low-cost machine to produce sanitary napkins in simple steps.Every week, Jha travels to villages in Jonha panchayat, around 40km from Ranchi, with a bagful of sanitary napkins. Local adolescent girls have joined him in his mission. They spread awareness among women in the village when Jha isnt around.The villagers know him and call him Mangru Dada, meaning elder brother, as most of them cannot pronounce Mangesh. He speaks fluent Nagpuri, a tribal dialect, and that helps.Dharmi Kumari, a 22-year-old resident of Rasabera village, is one such new-found campaigner impressed with Jhas initiative. She speaks to the girls and convinces them to use sanitary pads.I have known Mangru Dada for nearly a year now. After seeing his motivation and sincerity I thought if a person from the city can do so much for menstrual hygiene in my village, why shouldnt I contribute too, she said.The change in peoples age-old perception is extraordinary as menstruation is considered impure in the countryside. From being barred from religious shrines to dietary restrictions and enforced isolation during their periods to a lack of access to toilets, women continue to face many challenges during menstruation.Women have traditionally used scrap cloth from old saris or towels, adding a layer of sand, ash or rice husk for added protection during heavy blood flow.Women here used ash, husk, grass and even sand. Many suffered from urinary and reproductive tract infections, Jha said.Last week, he was at Rasabera village, a hamlet of 200 people who dont have access to electricity. There is no road either and Jha walked miles along a narrow mud trail through jungles frequented by Maoist insurgents to reach the families.He also visits Jidu, Jaratoli, Mungadih and Hondru villages  all backward hamlets with no civic amenities.According to government health worker Patti Devi of Jaratoli village, Jha discusses problems of the local women and provides remedies. We must put ourselves in their shoes for a day to know what they go through, he said, underscoring the plight of the rural women.The Indian government had announced subsidised sanitary products for poor women, but the menstrual hygiene initiative has yet to reach the remote villages."

Beneath each course were three oh-so-diplomatic options. Starters featured a prawn cocktail served with avocado salad , a steakhouse staple POTUS would probably be reassured to see; Korean stuffed cucumbers; and green mango kerabu with honey-lime dressing and fresh octopus. Kerabu, a staple of Malay cuisine, is a refreshing salad judged by the balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot notes in the dressing.BBC News reported that the stuffed cucumbers, or oiseon, caused some raised eyebrows among Koreans, given the dish's royal origins. ""It's a bit like the British prime minister sitting down to dine with a visiting dignitary and chowing down on a roasted swan - a favourite of Henry VIII,"" the news outlet declared.Wherever Trump and Asian leaders meet, beef is sure to be in the picture. Over a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last November, hamburgers were served. On a trip to China last year, Trump's hosts seemed to be appealing to his affection for steak with ketchup when he was offered ""stewed beef steak in tomato sauce.""Sure enough, beef, as in short rib confit, was one of three main course selections. The entree was rounded out with steamed broccolini (doctor's orders, maybe, since Trump is said to be dieting?) and potato dauphinois, a fancier way to say potatoes au gratin, a Trump favorite. Both leaders can get around spuds. Kim, who as a teenager studied abroad in Switzerland, is said to have developed a fondness for rosti, the country's famous potato pancakes.In deference to Trump, a teetotaler, the beef's red wine sauce was listed as ""on the side."" (Kim, who has retained both Japanese sushi and Italian pizza makers, reportedly has a fondness for fine French wines.)The alternate entrees were soy-braised cod with Asian vegetables and sweet-and-sour pork with Yangzhou fried rice flavored with XO chile sauce. Was the fried rice a sly way to find a spot for China, North Korea's largest trading partner, at the table? Kim arrived in the city/state aboard a Boeing 747 operated by Air China. Multiple news sources said he brought along some of his own food and even a toilet.Dessert - the course with the power to leave a last impression - was decidedly Western. Choices included a dark chocolate tartlet; the cream- or custard-filled brioche called Tropezienne; and vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis. The scoops came from Haagen-Dazs, the only designer label flagged on the menu. Presumably, Trump didn't get his preferred double helping of ice cream.Video of guests gathering for the lunch shows pre-plated starters on a rectangular table lined down the center with soothing green- and cream-colored flowers. While Singapore was the facilitating host, Trump appeared to take command, asking photographers: ""Getting a good picture everybody? So we look nice and handsome and thin? Perfect.""Getting to ""perfect,"" or close to it, involves teams from both sides identifying the preferences and steering clear of the dislikes of the principals, says Peter Selfridge, who served as U.S. chief of protocol during the last three years of the Obama administration. Reached for comment, the former ambassador said via email, ""At first glance, it looks like rather than having to decide on one main dish that would appease both [palates] - a difficult task under normal conditions - they chose to offer something for everyone, while also giving a nod to the flavors of the host country."" Selfridge called the summit lunch, which brought together 13 principals from both delegations, ""a little unexpected,"" given the early stage of the talks between the two world leaders. Then again, he said, ""sharing a meal goes a long way to breaking the ice."""
5b22da309855b7429b3175aa,Learning with the Times: Why monsoon matters beyond the farm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/learning-with-the-times-why-monsoon-matters-beyond-the-farm/articleshow/64534908.cms,2018-06-11,"The monsoons failure is often linked to the economys overall performance. It is not the agricultural sector alone that is affected by a bad monsoon  industry too suffers as lower farm output decreases demand from this sector, which employs half the countrys workforce. Contrasting GDP growth rates with drought years since 1951-52 reveals growth is sluggish in drought years. In recent years this correlation has become weaker, which may be linked to the fact that agricultures share in GDP has also fallen. But it continues to employ half of Indias workforce.Over the past decade, the share of Kharif (monsoon) crops in the national output have fallen, while Rabi (winter) crops are on the rise. Crops like rice and maize , which grow in monsoon and winter, have seen a marked decline in Kharif output, while the share of their Rabi output has risen. Exclusively Rabi crops, such as wheat, remain unaffected by monsoons.The southwest monsoon is a summertime reversal in wind direction that provides nearly 70% of the Indian subcontinents annual rainfall. Monsoon winds originate from the southern Indian Ocean . They get deflected southwestwards towards India after crossing the equator. These winds are driven by air pressure differences caused by the more rapid heating up of the land in summers compared to the ocean. The land heats up the air over it, causing it to rise and create a low-pressure zone, which attracts winds from the highpressure regions over the ocean.In south Asia, the effect is enhanced by the Tibetan plateau, which heats up more than the atmosphere would at its height. Monsoon has a set pattern of advance and withdrawal. It arrives in southern India in May or June, and advances northwards and westwards, reaching Pakistan by July. It retreats from Pakistan by September, finally withdrawing from southern India by December. The season doesnt see a continuous deluge, but has alternate wet and dry phases, the timing and duration of which account for much of the year-to-year variation in monsoon rains.Mawsynram, a village in Meghalaya is the worlds wettest place. Meghalaya receives the countrys highest rainfall followed by Goa and Sikkim. The national capital on the other hand was among the driest states in 2016."

They also agreed  as decided during their first informal summit at Wuhan in April  to maintain strategic communications through various channels, including telephone calls and frequent meetings on the sidelines of multilateral events.Xis visit will be preceded by a flurry of high-level meetings this year, including meetings between the foreign, defence and home ministers and the national security advisers. The Special Representatives on the border issue will also meet this year.Following the meeting between Modi and Xi on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in the coastal city of Qingdao, the two sides signed agreements on China providing hydrological information for the Brahmaputra river and on exporting rice from India.Describing the nearly hour-long meeting as substantial and forward looking, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said both leaders made a very positive assessment of developments since they last met in the central city of Wuhan during April 28-29.Ties between the two neighbours had nosedived following last years military standoff at Doklam and also due to several other issues, including China blocking a move to sanction Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar at the UN Security council and Beijings opposition to New Delhis bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group.Both sides have said the Wuhan summit helped put the troubled relationship back on an even keel. During his speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on June 1, Modi had talked about working closely with China and said an Asia of cooperation could shape this century.Though new and old contentious issues remain, there has been a turnaround in bilateral ties since the military standoff was resolved last August.Tweeting about Saturdays meeting, Chinas envoy to India, Luo Zhaohui, said Xi and Modi had discussed the implementation of Wuhan consensus and drawing (up a) blueprint for future China-India relations.The Indian foreign secretary agreed, saying the talks were underpinned by the spirit of the Wuhan summit.One of the important outcomes of todays meeting was that the Chinese side conveyed that they accepted (Modis) invitation to President Xi Jinping to have a similar informal summit in India in 2019, he said.On the border dispute, Gokhale said Modi and Xi agreed that under the Special Representatives mechanism, National Security Adviser AK Doval and Chinas foreign minister Wang Yi will meet later this year.They agreed on the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border and continuing strategic communications on the issue. The two militaries will continue to talk to each other to maintain peace, Gokhale said.External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi will head a new mechanism to oversee people-to-people contacts, and will soon meet to discuss details.Gokhale said Xi referred to the growing popularity of Indian films and not only spoke about the success of the movie Dangal in China, but also mentioned that Baahubali 2 and other Hindi movies had done well in the country.The two leaders also agreed on increasing bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2020, and Xi said China is ready to enhance agricultural imports from India.To that end, one of the agreements signed on Saturday amended the 2006 protocol on phytosanitary requirements for exporting rice from India to include the export of non-basmati varieties of rice.The other MoU enables the Chinese side to provide hydrological data on the Brahmaputra during the flood season from May 15 to October 15 every year. It also enables China to provide data if the water level exceeds a mutually agreed level during the non-flood season. India had said last year that China did not stick to an agreement to share hydrological data, or scientific information on the movement and quality of water, for the Brahmaputra.The two leaders also discussed China importing high quality pharmaceutical products from India. Xi said China will encourage Indian companies to register in China for exports.(Modi) also conveyed to President Xi Jinping our readiness to permit the Bank of China to establish a branch office in Mumbai, Gokhale said.Taking forward a decision made at Wuhan to work jointly on a developmental project in war-torn Afghanistan, the two leaders agreed to identify a capacity building project.On Afghanistan, there was a brief discussion on the projects. One of the outcomes of todays meeting is that we have agreed we will move forward in identifying a specific project initially in the area of capacity building, Gokhale said.So, we have to begin the process of identifying it (the project), he added.This was the 14th meeting between the two leaders over the past four years. Modi arrived here on Saturday afternoon for a two-day visit to attend the annual SCO Summit.Xi called the Wuhan summit a new starting point of bilateral relations and Modi concurred, saying it was a milestone. The leaders agreed the Wuhan summit had helped develop mutual trust and understanding and take the relationship in a positive direction."

Those kids who were attending classes were being given banana and samosa by teachers, who arranged the breakfast with their own money.Angry over the laxity by officials, the DM ordered action against Assistant Basic Shiksha Adhikari (ABSA) and constituted a probe committee to look into the matter.

Everest and training and preparing them for the feat is a daunting task, especially if the aspirants have no exposure. But a veteran of 17 attempts to the summit and well-known mountaineer Bimala Negi Deoskar her husband Avinash knew what they were looking for. Having trained many youths in adventure and endurance sports, the couple went about in earnest to select the final ten who have been catapulted to fame and glory after scaling Mt. Everest.Why where ten people picked up and what where you looking for while making the selection?Considering the extent of training required and the budgets that it entails, it was not possible to have a very large group. Ten was manageable. We were looking for physical strength, intellectual capacity, social and emotional quotient, as team work is required.What did the training entail and how was it planned?We explored the potential among the students of ashram schools. The ITDP (Integrated Tribal Development Project) officials suggested them. The biggest challenge was to tell them about this expedition. They dont watch much television and have no exposure. But they are into lots of sports activity. We told them to practice and show us their strength. After ten days, we selected 50 on the basis of their physical strength, age as only those above 18 years can scale from the China side. We held a six-day camp at Wardha to develop their communication skills and introduced them to the concept of increasing physical endurance and tested their intelligence through simulation. At the Bhongir facility in Hyderabad, they underwent a specially designed mountaineering course which included rock climbing, rappelling and grip techniques. They learnt about what was required of them. In Darjeeling, they climbed 17,000ft. A medical test was conducted at every stage. They were graded after each session.Why was it important to train them at Leh & Ladakh?We went there to simulate Everest conditions. We had taken them to Hyderabad in AC coach and many fell sick. It gets very cold and very lonely in the mountains which can cause depression. They were taken for night climbing as the climb to the summit begins at night. It was here that the final realization if they can do it or not came. That confidence of I can do it engaged them. They realized their strengths, learned to fight negativity and the importance of communication.In the final lap of training, could you achieve the desired results?After Leh & Ladakh, we gave them a months break to write their exams. But all of them were kept at one place and we controlled their nutrition and exercise regimen. Most of them are rice eaters. We had to include foods like porridge and fruits in their diet. They practised yoga, meditation and breath control and were asked to eat at regular intervals. We showed them films about rescue and disaster. They were given a mental picture of what awaited them. They were super fit after the training."

Three Goan restaurants opened in Mumbai in just three months. O Pedro in BKC, House of Lloyd in Juhu and Lady Baga at Kamala Mills.Goan food hasnt always been easy to find in Mumbai. Especially non-Gomantak Christian Goan food. For anyone looking for it, providence should have automatically taken you to Bandra West. After all, any and all platitudes say that if its Christian, its in Bandra. This may be somewhat true. After all Bandra does have a concentrated population of Christians, even Catholics. But in all my years as a food hunter, I never found a single Goan restaurant in Bandra. Possibly because all the land in the Bandra villages was owned by the Marathi-speaking East Indian community, and not the Goans.The original Konkani-speaking Goans, however, made south Mumbai areas like Princess Street, Dhobi Talao and Mazagaon their berth. About 150 years ago, when large groups of young men from Portuguese Goa began migrating to this city in search of work, they shared rented rooms according to their native villages; kudds or clubs that were also named after the patron saints of that village.In Jer Mahal, opposite Metro Cinema, in a small dark room, bangda-curry rice was the only dish on the menu. (HT File Photo)These hungry souls missed their home food and had to be fed. So the first few Catholic Goan food joints opened in the gullies of Marine Lines and Dhobi Talao. Antons bangda-curry rice was famous. In Jer Mahal, opposite Metro Cinema, in a small dark room, bangda-curry rice was the only dish on the menu. Right behind Jer Mahal, on the corner of Jambul Wadi, is Castle Hotel, another old-style Goan eatery. The menu changes every day, but fish-curry-rice is staple.C DSouza, opposite Our Lady of Seven Dolours, is still standing. I went there about two years ago, to be welcomed by an empty room with empty tables and chairs. After I had walked to the back of the caf, an old lady appeared and asked sweetly what I wanted. I pointed at the handwritten menu on chart paper, and asked for pork vindaloo, beef chilly (it was okay in those days) and pav.She stared at me for a minute as if I might be an apparition. Then she yelled at another old lady, who turned out to be the cook, and asked her if she could cook up some chilly fry and vindaloo. The cook muttered something in Konkani and returned to the kitchen. The meal did arrive, albeit 30 minutes later; and it tasted of home. Freshly cooked, home-style masalas; simple, and spectacular.New Martin at Colaba, in the erstwhile Strand Cinema lane. Though the owners are Mangalorean, the sorpotel is unbeatable. (HT File Photo)Venice Caterers and Snowflakes Goan Restaurant used to both be in Dhobi Talao. Venice behind Dhobi Talao Market and Snowflakes at 1st Kalbadevi Lane. Venice has either shut down since, or the market is now so crowded and dirty that, even after walking up and down the lane, I couldnt seem to find it anywhere.Snowflakes gets surprisingly crowded at lunchtime, and has an extensive handwritten menu in cursive: Sausage Chilly Fry, Pork Sorpotel, Pork Vindaloo, Pork Chilly Fry, Bangda Rechad, Prawn Pulao, STEAK, AMOTIK, TONGUE ROAST and caramel Custard. I dont know why the last three dishes are written in capital letters.While I mourn the premature demise of City Kitchen, one of the finest Goan restaurants in Mumbai, pioneered by the late football player Sacru Menezes, between you and me, the last one standing is New Martin at Colaba, in the erstwhile Strand Cinema lane. Though the owners are Mangalorean, the sorpotel there is unbeatable. The vindaloo has the spice and aroma of eating in the bylanes of Panjim on a hot sweaty day. The fish curry is tangy and the fish and coconut are fresh.My testimony to this place is that I go there at least twice a month, walking into Martin at Colaba and walking out on St Inez Road, Panjim.I must of course discuss the three new Goan restaurants in Mumbai. But for that youll have to wait another week."

Most of them are either fair price shop owners or those working with the agency that was entrusted with the job of data entry of the beneficiaries. No government official has been so far been implicated in the case, neither has anybodys name cropped up during investigation.After initial arrests of those who leaked the biometric data and few PDS shop owners, police are yet to identify those who made top politicians and diamantaires NFSA beneficiaries.Names of Surat BJP MP Darshana Jardosh and diamantaire Vasant Gajera were in the list of beneficiaries under NFSA. Under this act, wheat and rice are distributed among beneficiaries at Rs 2/kg and Rs 3/kg respectively and only families with financially poor background can get registered as beneficiaries.If the diamantaire and the MP didnt went there to register their names as beneficiaries then who entered their names? Whether their names were put on the list with the approval of any government official? These aspects need to be probed, said Ajay Jangid, an RTI activist who had exposed the scam.A number of wealthy families were in the list of beneficiaries under NFSA and foodgrain were issued in their names. Further, there are beneficiaries who do not exist at all but foodgrain are being purchased in their names too. This is not possible without involvement of government officers, added Jangid.Jangid had initially started a movement on social media on finding the shocking details based on which the district collectorate officials lodged complaints at eight police stations in January 2018. Based on these complaints, the crime branch made first arrests in February.I have instructed the crime branch officials to investigate the role of government officers, if any, said city police commissioner Satish Sharma."

While a majority of closures are due to the lack of consent, a few have been shut down because they didnt set up effluent treatment plants.There are several categories under which units operate. Mining industries, hospitals, big industries and chemical units are categorised as red. Green units are cottage industries, rice mills, masala grinding, printing presses and other small industries. The orange category includes automobile servicing and repair stations, non-alcoholic beverage plants, fish processing plants, retreading, moulding, etc. CPCBs instructions to GSPCB state that all units in these three categories that are operating without consent must shut down.The CPCB recently pulled up the GSPCB for not uploading data about industrial units on its web portal, and directed it to do so immediately.

He will go to the house of rice innovator Dadaji Khobragade who died last Sunday.After paying condolences and meeting his kin at Nanded village in Sindewahi taluka of Chandrapur district, about 100 km from here, Rahul will address a farmers chaupal at the same village.Khobragade, who revolutionized paddy farming by developing the high yielding variety of rice HMT, never got commercial dividends from it as state agencies, including the agriculture university, usurped the credit. He lived in penury and could not afford even medical treatment following a paralysis attack in his last days. CM Devendra Fadnavis did sanction 2.5 lakh from his relief fund, but it was too late as he breathed his last at SEARCH Hospital at Gadchiroli Meanwhile, in a game of political oneupmanship, the BJP MP from Chandrapur and Union minister of state for Home, Hansraj Ahir, rushed to Nanded village and consoled the bereaved family of Khobragade on Monday.In the week since Dadaji died, no top leader from the ruling party found time for the visit. But as soon as the news of Rahul Gandhis plan was announced, the BJP leaders have darted towards the village.Chimur MLA Kiritkumar Bhangadia accompanied Ahir and they promised the Khobragade family that an entrance gate to the village will be built as a memorial to the deceased rice researcher.A hospital in the district will also be named after Dadaji Khobragade as a mark of respect to him.Meanwhile, in a game of political oneupmanship, the BJP MP from Chandrapur and Union minister of state for Home, Hansraj Ahir, rushed to Nanded village and consoled the bereaved family of Dadaji Khobragade on Monday evening.In the week since Dadaji died, no top leader from the ruling party found time for the visit. But as soon as the news of Rahul Gandhis plan was announced, the BJP leaders desperately darted towards the village.Chimur MLA Kiritkumar Bhangadia accompanied Ahir and they promised the Khobragade family that an entrance gate to the village will be built as a memorial to the deceased rice researcher. A hospital in the district will also be named after him as a mark of respect to him.This will be Rahul Gandhis first visit after becoming president of his party and a non-election-time visit after three years. In 2015, he had undertaken a 15-km padyatra and met families of nine farmers who had ended life in the distress-ridden region that has witnessed thousands of farm suicides in the last over a decade.But what captured national headlines in 2008 was his famous visit to farmer widow Kalavati Bandurkar at Jalka village and Shashikala Ringne of Sonkhaas village, both in Yavatmal district , the epicentre of farmers suicides in the cotton belt of Vidarbha. He referred to Kalavatis plight during parliamentary debate on Indo-US pact for peaceful use of nuclear power.State Congress president Ashok Chavan told TOI that objective of Rahuls visit was to pay tributes to Khobragade. A farmers meet called chaupal was also organised by the party in which the party president is expected to target the BJP-led Narendra Modi government that had failed to fulfil promises given to farmers. Modi had in March 2014, during Lok Sabha election campaign, held a Chai pe charcha with farmers at Dabhadi village in Yavatmal district, but many of the promises he handed out then are yet to be realised, Chavan said.Rahul will land in Nagpur from Mumbai on Wednesday around 11am and take off by helicopter to Nanded village were a helipad is being built. He will spend an hour-and-half there and hop back to Nagpur from where he is to fly back to Delhi."

Some part of the cold storage is still standing but it has turned weak necessitating its demolition, they said.Interestingly, a cold storage-cum-godown at Kalamna , owned by the same firm which operated Adinath Cold Storage, had caught fire in February.As reported by TOI on June 3, the cold storage had a stock of around 13,500 gunny bags of red chillis and huge quantity of wheat, pulses, corn etc.An official from the fire department said it was a very difficult task to bring the fire at Adinath Cold Storage under control due to burning of red chillis. We waited for three days so that red chillis are completely gutted. In the absence of wide entrance, we had to bore holes in the walls of the cold storage to attempt firefighting. As the days passed, it became riskier as the structure damaged by the fire had started to collapse, he said.In Kalamna fire incident, around 60,000 quintal rice , wheat and pulses had been destroyed.Activist Kamlesh Shah said NMC officials should be held responsible for the two fire incidents. I have been complaining about violations in cold storages since 2012. None of the departments took cognisance. The authorities should now inspect all cold storages and shut down those violating norms. Any loss to foodgrains is a national loss. Also, many farmers and traders get affected due to such incidents, he said.In a major tragedy six years ago, Pravesh Cold Storage at Chikhli had caved in killing 18 persons on January 31, 2012."

And this time, in keeping with current trends, theyve gone with Modern Asian  which means mostly Chinese, some sashimi, a mix of traditional and modern dim sums and sushi, and a sprinkling of south east Asian mains.Both menu and the interiors are designed to attract groups of young people who will order as much from the bar as the kitchen.

On a Monday evening it is filled with a large office group cheerfully hosting a send-off for a colleague. In the outdoor area running along the sides of the restaurant, young couples and friends catch up over drinks.Expecting no surprises we order the smoked edamame and truffle (a staple on Modern Asian menus) and the chicken and enoki mushroom dim sum.The taste of the truffle oil is missing in the smoked edamame and truffle dim sum; the edamame has a chalky, mashed pea-like texture and tastes overpoweringly of garlic.We cant taste the truffle oil; the edamame has a chalky, mashed pea-like texture and tastes overpoweringly of garlic. Nor can we taste, or feel, any enoki in the chicken. Were told its minced into the chicken filling, which seems a waste of the mushrooms unique crunchy texture.The grilled pepper tenderloin, though, is everything it should be. The thin slices of beef are juicy and tender and theres a sharp undertone of pepper in every bite. Its worth ordering seconds of this one.The grilled pepper tenderloins thin slices of beef are juicy and tender with a sharp undertone of pepper in every bite. Its so good, were tempted to go for seconds.The Asian arancini, a play on the Sicilian deep-fried cheese and risotto balls, are chatpata crispy rice croquettes. Theyre not in the least Asian, but so full of strong flavours you can help but eat another one.Having filled up on starters we keep the main course simple. A lightly aromatic lemongrass rice and a sweet potato Massaman curry thats a perfectly acceptable vegetarian version. You dont miss the meat, and the sweetness of crispy, deep fried potato cubes melds with the sweet-spicy flavour of the Thai curry.The Asian arancini, a take on the Sicilian deep-fried cheese-and-risotto balls, arent Asian in the least, but are a crunchy, flavourful delight.At about 10:30 pm the restaurant turns more lounge; the lights are dimmed and the music gets louder (but not so loud it makes conversation difficult). Still, we make haste with the tub tib krob. Their version of the Thai dessert, with green and red water chestnuts, is more colourful than usual yet not too sweet. It is a little heavy on the crushed ice, though.While theres nothing exceptional, or noteworthy, about 12 Union Park, theres nothing terrible about it either. Its not trying to be anything more than a neighbourhood watering hole that also serves decent food. And its doing that well.(HT pays for all meals and reviews anonymously)"

The aromatic rice goes well with meat dishes and is used for a variety of biryani. -Sitosterol present in the rice grain inhibits cholesterol absorption in the intestine. It has also been proved that it can control cancer growth in humans, the association said.Cultivation of seeraga samba is confined to Vellapallam and Keevalur taluks in Nagapattinam district; Uppiliyapuram panchayat union in Trichy district; and parts of Thanjavur district in central Tamil Nadu.IPR attorney P Sanjai Gandhi, who has obtained the maximum number of GI tags in the country, said seeraga samba rice could be cultivated throughout the year in the paddy growing tracks of the state since the grains could withstand intermittent drought even at its critical stages of growth.The rice variety is also mentioned in the medicinal notes of Pathartha Kunapadam of yogis and siddhas, said Gandhi.Seeraga samba owes its unique taste and flavour to its soil source and water, the GI tag application filed before the authorities said.Once the GI tag is approved, the applicant-association can enlist a number of authorised users who could produce the rice as per specification, and derive commercial benefits. Unauthorised use of the name seeraga samba would invite action, including fine and a prison term."

Modi also said that an Asia of rivalry will hold the region back while an Asia of cooperation will shape the current century.The prime ministers comments at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore were appreciated by China.Chinas appreciation of what Modi said was conveyed by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj during a meeting held on the sidelines of the BRICS Foreign Ministers Meeting in South Africa this week.It is for the first time the Indian prime minister will be attending the SCO summit after India along with Pakistan became full-fledged members of the grouping last year.The SCO currently has eight member countries which represents around 42 per cent of the worlds population and 20 per cent of the global GDP.India was an observer at the SCO since 2005 and has generally participated in the ministerial-level meetings of the grouping which focus mainly on security and economic cooperation in the Eurasian region."

However, if the low-pressure area over north Bay of Bengal intensifies into a depression, it can push the monsoon current towards Bihar. However, no change has been witnessed in the low-pressure area since Sunday, which means it is stagnant, said Pradhan Parth Sarthi, associate professor, department of environmental science, Central University of South Bihar and secretary of Indian Meteorological Society, Bihar.Meanwhile, the IMDs Patna office has predicted widespread pre-monsoon rainfall in several districts of state on Tuesday and Wednesday and scattered rainfall from Thursday onwards.Weathermen have attributed the prevailing weather conditions to an east-west trough that runs from Punjab to the centre of a low-pressure area over the northeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh across Haryana, Uttar Pradesh Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal.The late arrival of monsoon adversely affects rice crops. Although with scientific advancements, enough awareness has been created on how to save the rice seeds from damage. IMD, weather and agricultural scientists from Bihar have also planned to conduct an awareness programme by the end of June to create awareness about sustainable ways of farming when the onset of monsoon is late. It includes information on certain rice seeds that sustain and grow in less amount of water, Sarthi said."

The septuagenarian leader, who arrived in Mysuru on Tuesday, said he will stay and not run away. But he was cagey on meeting voters from Chamundeshwari segment even while holding a thanksgiving meet for supporters from Varuna segment.Varuna segment, abutting the Chamundeshwari constituency, elected his son, Yathindra, to the state assembly. Thanking voters, Siddaramaiah said: When I contested from Varuna, my victory margin was 30,000 votes. But you have elected Yathindra with over 58,000 votes. This is one of the highest in Karnataka.Siddaramaiah, who aspired to represent Chamundeshwari segment for one last time, made no bones that he was disappointed. He had lost to JD(S) leader G T Devegowda by over 33,000 votes. When he arrived at his home, there were not many of his supporters. When one of them felicitated him by extending a shawl and attempted to crown him with a Mysuru peta , the traditional headgear, Siddaramaiah said: People have fooled me and it is enough.Hours later he attended a thanksgiving meeting at a choultry in Kuvempu Nagar where he wondered the reasons for the setback in Chamundeshwari. Some of the speakers at the meet told the leader of the Congress Legislative Party, that some of his supporters let him down. Siddaramaiah refused to respond, but said he would have won easily from Varuna had he contested. You have never let me down, he said. When I contested in 2008, I became leader of opposition after my victory. In 2013, I became the CM after I was elected by Varuna segment.Siddaramaiah wondered why people let the party down when he walked the talk, ruled the state without corruption scandals and provided stable governance. But he took solace from Congress vote share  38 per cent to BJPs 36 per cent. This shows we have popular support, he said. Ive been in politics since 40 years and Ive presented 13 budgets. As the CM I focused on poor and downtrodden. I thought Karnataka should be free from hunger and implemented Anna Bhagya scheme, which is extending free rice to four crore people. None of the BJP ruled states are doing it. But still people didnt support Congress the way I had thought they would.He said Anna Bhagya scheme came from his experience as a child when people in his village cooked rice only during festivals or when some relatives had come down. Now, rice is cooked by poor, he stated. Im pained that people didnt support me the way Id worked for their welfare.He said voters in Chamundeshwari didnt support him for minor reasons like he didnt speak to them or that police stopped them when he was touring their villages. But Ive taken defeats in my stride and it will be no different, he stated pointing out that tall leaders like B R Ambedkar, Indira Gandhi and D Deveraja Urs were defeated by the people.He pledged his support for the development of Varuna segment with his son-MLA."

MC commissioner Sandeep Hans said reducing anxiety levels of stray dogs is part of the stray dog management system adopted by the civic body.The MC is in the process of engaging an NGO which, apart from sterilizing stray dogs, will fit electronic chips in each dog after sterilization and record data about the area to which the dog belongs and the date of sterilization.Hans said, The NGO claimed that apart from conducting a survey of stray and pet dogs, expert veterinary doctors engaged by the NGO will work on reducing anxiety levels of aggressive dogs after identifying them. Such dogs will be kept under observation and undergo treatment for four to five days before being released into the area from where they were captured. The NGO claims that this will help reduce stray dog bite cases in the city. NGO will conduct a survey to identify the most dog bite prone areas as well.Mayor Kulwant Singh said the NGO said they can fix a unique identification number, embedded on a microchip, under the skin of a stray dog. It will have complete data about the animal. The agenda point may also be brought up in the forthcoming MC house meet.The process will create a data bank on the number of stray and pet dogs in the city, said mayor Kulwant Singh, adding that an NGO delivered a presentation in front of MC officials and councillors in this regard. The mayor said, The NGO has claimed it will fix a chip in each stray dog, containing complete information about the animal and will also conduct zone-wise census of stray dogs. The NGO will also conduct sterilization and dog catching activity on existing rates. We have decided to raise the agenda point in the next house meet to get clearance of the house.Elaborating on the advantages of fixing a chip in a stray dog, NGO representative Nilesh said digital identification of pet dogs will replace the conventional cumbersome procedure of granting licenses for pets.The chip implant, an integrated circuit placed under the skin of the animal, will allow officials to maintain complete information about the dog, including its age and vaccination details and the owners name and address, he said.He added the chip, about the size of a large grain of rice with a 14-digit number, uses passive radio frequency identification technology to identify animals. It will be injected under the neck of the animal in a simple process."

This is not much of an increase compared to last years production of 109.37 lakh tonnes, but the state is pinning its hopes on less water-intensive crops like millets and pulses.The state government plans to achieve 110 lakh tonnes of foodgrain production by ensuring region-specific and crop-specific technological interventions, agriculture minister R Doraikannu said. Massive promotion of micro irrigation may bring in 3.57 lakh acres this year with funding support from the Centre and state. The TN government absorbs 12% of GST in micro irrigation system. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami recently offered a Rs 115 crore kuruvai special financial package, for the sixth year in a row, which includes 12-hour three-phase power supply and subsidized machinery and productivity enhancing components to assist delta farmers. Poor inflows from Karnataka reservoirs coupled with poor monsoon forced the state to announce a samba special package for three years. Lalgudi MLA A Soundarapandian warned that the groundwater table was precarious in the region as farmers continued to extract water. Saline water intrusion rendered agriculture difficult in coastal areas, leaving three-phase supply useless, the DMK MLA said.The successful implementation of system of rice intensification for judicious use of water would be promoted this year as well in an area of 10 lakh acres, besides direct sowing technique. The state would promote formation of 2,000 farmer producer groups, organizing two lakh small and marginal farmers, as part of collective farming , for credit mobilization and better adoption of technology. Each group would get a corpus fund of Rs five lakh for farmers to purchase machinery for common use. DMK MLA K Sundar said the farmers suffered a lot due to inter-state water disputes with neighbours, Kerala, Karanataka and Andhra Pradesh.The CM said acquisition of land for Pennaiyar-Cheyyar, which would benefit Kancheepuram district, was completed for two out of four phases. A few affected individuals moved court and this caused delay. We dont want to waste even a drop of water, he said."

(Source: File Photo) we need to introspect on our shortcomings and chalk out a time-bound roadmap to meet various goals to make India a healthy nation. (Source: File Photo)The quality of life in a country can be best gauged by its education and health indicators. In fact, they are a measure of the countrys progress. Since Independence, India has done reasonably well on the education front, though we could have done better.On health indices, there have been some successes but we still face innumerable, complex challenges. Over the years, we have successfully eradicated diseases such as polio and tetanus, done reasonably well in the fight against malaria and in halting the spread of HIV. Today, the country is grappling with the twin problems of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) due to a variety of causes. With India ranked at an unflattering 154th in a Lancet study on Healthcare Access and Quality Index published last year, we need to gird up our loins to make India Swasth Bharat in the coming years. Both the public and private sector have a gargantuan task on hand as a whole range of issues have to be tackled  from the problem of malnutrition to providing an inclusive and affordable healthcare to every citizen.No doubt, we have made rapid strides in expanding medical facilities but the growth is lop-sided with the rural areas lagging far behind cities, where state-of-the-art hospitals, both in the public and private sector, are catering to the people. The functioning of government-run medical facilities in rural areas has to be improved. Although the number of medical colleges in the country has increased to 470, India has less than one doctor for every 1,000 people, which is below the WHO norm. The doctor-population ratio is estimated to be 0.62:1,000 as per the current population, while the number of hospital beds is estimated to be 0.5 per 1,000 people.Today being the World Health Day, we need to introspect on our shortcomings and chalk out a time-bound roadmap to meet various goals to make India a healthy nation. The first and foremost priority has to be to increase the public expenditure on the health sector.With the economy projected to improve further in the coming years, public expenditure on the health sector has to be enhanced significantly. Among the communicable diseases, tuberculosis needs to be tackled on a war-footing as MDR-TB is posing a major health concern. Seasonal outbreak of vector-borne diseases like dengue and growing antibiotic resistance is the other major concern.With modern lifestyles  lack of physical activity, unhealthy food habits, tobacco and alcohol use and work-related stress  playing havoc with the lives of people, the non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  diabetes, heart disease and stroke, cancer and chronic respiratory disease  have now become the leading cause of death in India. It is estimated that they are responsible for about 61 per cent of deaths. A similar trend is being witnessed in rural areas too.Ensuring proper healthcare to the elderly is another major area of concern for the governments and all other stakeholders involved in the health sector. The problems associated with geriatrics such as dementia, Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases are on the rise, while depression in both the young and old is becoming a major health issue. Perhaps, it might be a good idea to set up special geriatric clinics in different localities in cities under public-private partnership.Although successive governments, both at the national level and in various states, have been constantly upgrading and creating new infrastructure to improve health outcomes, we still have to ensure that IMR and MMR decline further. Undoubtedly, economic status plays a major role in determining the health outcomes. Lack of proper nutrition, sanitation and poverty are associated with worse health outcomes. With unhygienic conditions causing various infectious diseases, the Swachh Bharat programme will definitely help in tackling this issue in a significant way.In view of the low penetration of health insurance in India, I am sure the recently announced Ayushman Bharat scheme to provide health cover to 10 crore families and the proposal to set up 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres will go a long way in providing the much-needed affordable healthcare to millions across the country.As regards lifestyle diseases, it is time to launch a national movement to reverse their growing incidence. Instead of eating food preserved in the fridge, we need to return to our roots  traditional, time-tested food habits, besides taking up regular physical activity. People also prefer organic foods in view of their health benefits. In old times, food habits were dictated by the seasons. For instance, people in Telugu-speaking states used to eat Saddi Annam (fermented rice cooked overnight) in the morning. It is believed to have many health benefits. Similarly, we have been using turmeric in India for thousands of years while the Western world has discovered its medicinal traits such as anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties only in recent times. It should be remembered that a healthy nation can become a wealthy nation, but not vice versa.The fact that we have moved away from nature in modern times is also a reason for various illnesses. Living in harmony with nature and having enough fresh air, sunlight, fresh water and greenery are equally important for a healthy living. Health experts warn that children who do not spend enough time outdoors are at risk of developing myopia. We need to promote and practice yoga to lead a healthy life. It should become a part of the daily routine from schools to workplaces.In the end, I would like to conclude by stressing the need for every individual to make lifestyle changes and for the government to ensure that healthcare is affordable and accessible to the common man so that a healthy and happy India becomes a reality in the coming years. The private sector must follow ethical practices and supplement the efforts of the government.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b24c6fc9855b722ac49aebd,From Plate to Plough: Freeing the farm,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/agriculture-sector-indian-farmers-narendra-modi-farming-exports-5138673/,2018-04-16,"It is not just price competitiveness that restricts our exports; the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies. It is not just price competitiveness that restricts our exports; the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies.The Agriculture Minister, Radha Mohan Singh, recently tweeted about the governments resolve to increase the value of the countrys agricultural exports to $100 billion by 2022-23. The Dalwai Committee Report on doubling farmers incomes also talked of a similar target. It said, the aim should be to raise agricultural exports by a minimum of three times by 2022-23, to reach the target of $100 billion. Interestingly, the draft Agricultural Export Policy, that has been put in the public domain by the Minister of Commerce, has a much more modest target  $60 billion by 2022-23.When two Union ministries talk of vastly different goals for agri-exports, one wonders which ministry should one believe. One also wonders which ministry is actually responsible for attaining the concerned target. The different targets also reflect a disconnect within the government and show inter-ministerial coordination in poor light. In any case, it is worth noting that when the UPA held office, Indias agri-exports grew five times: From $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion by 2013-14. This was an unprecedented achievement in independent Indias history. Not only this, Indias net agri-export surplus (exports minus imports) increased from $3.7 billion in 2004-05 to about $27 billion in 2013-14; that was a more than a seven-fold increase. However, in 2014-16, Indias agri-exports fell to $32 billion. They rose marginally to $33 billion in 2016-17 (see graph). The net trade surplus fell to $9.5 billion in 2015-16 and further to $7.8 billion in 2016-17. The April-February data for 2017-18 shows agri-exports at $34 billion; this is likely to go up to about $38 billion once we have figures for the entire financial year.Thus, the real challenge for the Narendra Modi government is to first engineer recovery of agri-trade to the 2013-14 levels. Besides, the target of $60 billion by 2022-23 is less than a 50 per cent increase over a nine-year period  from 2013-14 to 2022-23. The target of $100 billion is surely bolder.In a global economy that is highly price- and quality-sensitive, what should be the strategy to double or triple Indian agri-exports by 2022-23? The draft Agri-Exports Policy rightly identifies two steps: Identify commodities in which India holds a global comparative advantage and develop clusters in states to create value chains for these commodities. Research conducted at ICRIER can be of help if the government decides to take the first step enunciated in the draft policy. Eleven commodities  marine products, rice, meat, spices, cotton, fresh fruits and vegetables, sugar, coffee, groundnut, oilmeals and cashews  comprised more than 80 per cent of the countrys agri-export basket in 2016-17. Our study of 10 years data pertaining to 70 per cent of Indias agricultural output (20 commodities), shows that most crops were globally price-competitive in most years. However, since 2013-14, many of these commodities lost out on competitiveness, due to a fall in global prices. But it is not just price competitiveness that restricts our exports; the biggest hurdle comes from uncertain domestic marketing and trade policies. The inherent consumer bias in these policies makes the trading environment unstable and unpredictable. Any rise in domestic prices almost immediately leads to the imposition of market restrictions. Exports are restricted through the use of minimum export prices and bans while the Essential Commodities Act is used to regulate private participation. This harms Indias image of a reliable supplier of agri-products and ensures that the country does not get the best price for its exports. This consumer bias in policy must be redressed and a balance should be struck between meeting the needs of food-insecure consumers and income-insecure farmers.The first change that is required pertains to mindsets. Instead of suppressing market prices for farmers to support consumers, the government should protect them through targeted unconditional income transfers. Restricting markets and compensating farmers through higher MSPs based on the new formula (cost A2+FL+50 per cent) will be an inflationary and unsustainable solution to the woes of the countrys agriculturists. It is likely to hit agri-exports adversely, especially rice and cotton. The exports will become uncompetitive.Second, policymakers should support agri-exports while ensuring environmental sustainability. While marine products, meat, oilmeals, groundnuts, cotton, spices, fruits and vegetables do not pose environmental problems, exports of rice must be properly assessed. Cultivating one kg of rice in Punjab or Haryana needs about 5,000 litres of irrigation water. This is drawn from underground and has led to a drastic fall in the groundwater table by 70 to 110 cms/year. Exporting large quantities of common rice from this region is akin to exporting billions of cubic meters of water. The best way to correct this would be to gradually phase-out power and irrigation subsidies, and replace them with a direct income support to farmers, while letting the prices of power and water reflect its true value.Third, the government must develop efficient global value chains and liberalise land lease markets across all states. It should encourage contract farming on a medium- to long-term basis. Exporters and processors must be encouraged to buy directly from farmer-producer organisations (FPOs), bypassing the inefficient APMCs. Major investments are needed at the back-end to create infrastructure for global and domestic value chains, ranging from produce aggregation to its sorting and grading, packaging, storing and linking the hinterlands to ports for export markets. The private sector can be an effective player in creating such value chains, but it needs to be enabled by institutional reforms. These investments could have a multiplier effect on the rural economy.Most of these reforms come under the jurisdiction of state governments. With the BJP holding office in more than 20 states, this is Modis moment to reform agri-markets in one go. If the government can usher in these changes, agri-exports will rise and so will farmers incomes. But whether they touch the $60 billion mark or the $100 billion target by 2022-23 will depend on how wide-ranging the reforms are and how efficient their implementation is. The governments record so far has been not very promising.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Congress provided farm loan waiver in 2006 and was now doing so in Punjab and Karnataka, he said hinting it would be replicated countrywide.Like Modi, I will not give any false promises and I have come here to tell you that if we are elected we will do all that is needed to rebuild your confidence, he said while interacting with farmers. Rahul did not give a speech but directly started a dialogue with the farmers that lasted over 20 minutes.Modi government is dishonest, it only cares for the 15 rich, top industrialists and has provided them Rs2.5 lakh crore corporate loan waiver. It will not do anything for the poor farmers, he said answering a question from college student Sagar Khobragade. The student asked Rahul how the Congress would address unemployment problem while pointing out Modi government had failed to provide promised 2 crore jobs to youth.Rahul said food processing units at village levels could provide jobs to farmers children and better price for the produce. You have to first elect the Congress, he quipped.He landed by helicopter from Nagpur, travelling 100 kms, and first visited the house of HMT rice inventor and researcher Dadaji Khobragade who passed away on June 3. Then he started an interaction with a modest crowd comprising some farmers and mostly party workers in the region reeling under farmer suicide crisis for the last two decades.Has Modiji ever offered to take questions from public like this, asked Rahul and drew an immediate applause. He said his request to make petrol, diesel cheaper by including them in GST list was not acceptable to Modi. Because he wants to rob money from your pockets and generously pass it on to Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. These two have walked away with Rs 35,000 crore of your money. While this much money was lavished on them, how many jobs have these two provided, Rahul questioned.With the chaupal pe charcha, the Congress is trying to re-establish support for the party in what was once its impregnable fort.Khobragade, 67, developed nine rice varieties in his modest farm and home. The high yielding HMT variety revolutionized paddy cultivation in the country. Ironically, he struggled with poverty all his life and was even robbed of credit for developing the HMT breed.After Khobragades death, politicians have started rushing to his village and offering sympathy and largesse in the form of money to his only son Mitrajit and daughter-in-law Raibai. They are marginal farmers with a small holding.In all Rahul took only three questions. The other two were asked by Ramchandra Deshmukh, a middle-aged farmer, and a woman, Avisha Rokde, a Congress gram panchayat member from Bhisi village.Top Congress leaders, AICC general secretary and former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot, MPCC president Ashok Chavan, AICC general secretary and Maharashtra in-charge Mohan Prakash, leader of opposition in Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, deputy chairman of legislative council Manikrao Thakre, former MPs Naresh Pugalia, Marotrao Kowase, Nana Patole and deputy leader of assembly Vijay Wadettiwar were among the large number of party leaders who made it clear the whole event was aimed at scoring some political points though it was around death of a prominent Dalit farmers untimely death.Questions Rahul Gandhi took on WednesdayModi promised 2 crore jobs to the youth. Not only he failed to keep that promise, but many people have lost jobs in last four years. What will you do if you win in 2019?Sagar Khobragade | 20Rahul: We will work on agriculture, food processing industry network, infrastructure like roads, and marketers to help farmers.Farmer suicides are unending. How will you stop them?Ramchandra Deshmukh | 50Rahul: By building farmers confidence in themselves, loan waivers are a temporary relief. Increasing price of farm produce will give more income to farmersFarmers do not seek loan waiver, they want better prices for produce. How can you ensure this?Avisha Rokde | 40Rahul: Providing opportunities of value addition, government funds for farm infrastructure and better remunerative prices for farm produce will be the way to go for solving agrarian crisis."

We get our surname from four generations of running these bhattis, says the Bhatiyara family.From boti biryani  which has succulent lamb chops layered with saffron and kewra-flavoured rice  to Hyderabadi haleem  beaten wheat broth spiked with grains, ginger and shredded meat served with crispy fried onions, chopped chillies, coriander and a dash of lime  makes a sublime dish and fast observers soul food . Home-style cooking lends unique taste to the cuisine, which is styled after royal taste, but caters to the common man.Another favourite is khichda, a nutritious preparation with mutton, which also consists of cereals and pulses for which lapsi dalia (broken wheat) has to be soaked overnight. Shahjeera (caraway seeds), pudina (fresh mint), peppercorns and sarson patte (mustard leaves) add up for the main flavours, while yoghurt and ghee balance the spices, says Irfanbhai Bhatiyara, who heads the team of expert cooks.With changing times, more modern preparations have been added to the street food menu.The youngest cook in the family Mohammad Safwaan points out, The new generation demands fancy food so we have now added Italian biryani, which has mixed boneless meat pieces layered in rice and silk chicken rolls that has tender chicken pieces wrapped in egg-bound flour pancakes and is deep fried."

He also said farmers in districts like Begusarai and Khagaria had started switching over to soyabean cultivation as it required less water.Kumar said farmers in north Bihar needed a strain of paddy that could withstand the gushing floodwaters, while those in the drought-prone south Bihar districts needed paddy which could weather lack of rain for a month.He said the challenge caused by flood was greater because the floodwaters usually damaged the standing paddy crops. Last year, 8.4 lakh hectare of paddy was destroyed. Farmers in the state take three crops  Kharif, Rabi and garma paddy. The minister also asked the IRRI scientists to present a demonstration of their method of paddy cultivation in the current Kharif season to which they agreed.IRRI DG Morell and agriculture scientist Arvind Kumar informed the minister that the institute had developed a strain of paddy that could withstand pressure of floodwaters for 15 days. Similarly, another strain of paddy could be cultivated in drought-prone areas as it required minimal water for a month.Morel said the IRRI had established its South Asia Regional Centre at Varanasi and had also been collaborating with several agriculture universities in the country, including Bihar Agriculture University at Sabour (Bhagalpur). The methods developed by IRRI helped reduce production costs and also promoted farm mechanisation and management of natural resources (like soil, water and insects), Morel said."

(Express photo) Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on dharna at the LGs office. (Express photo)Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his dharna politics is back with the latest sit-in at Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijals office entering the fourth day on Thursday. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has been staging a protest over a rift between the IAS officers and the Delhi government over an alleged assault on Delhi Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash.Many criticise Kejriwal for ignoring the work at the CM office and sitting on a dharna, which appears unusual for a chief minister. However, he is not the first chief minister to do so. There are several others who resorted to sit-in while in the hot seat.-In 1982, then Tamil Nadu chief minister MG Ramachandran observed a day-long fast Anna samadhi at Marina Beach, to protest against the Indira Gandhi-led governments refusal to allocate more rice to his state from the central reserve. Ramachandrans government had introduced the midday meal scheme for school children which had put a huge strain on the states pool. A furious Gandhi later announced more rice for Tamil Nadu, forcing the leader to wrap up his fast at the end of the day.-Former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa undertook a four-day hunger strike near the MGR memorial at Chennais Marina beach in 1993 after Karnataka refused to share 250 tmc of Cauvery water, as per the 1991-direction given by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, with its neighbour. The AIADMKs protest turned into a huge show after hundreds of workers from across the state arrived at the spot to extend their support to the party supremo. Medical bulletins were issued at regular intervals by the state health secretary.It was not until Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao sent his Cabinet colleague and Union Water Resources Minister V.C. Shukla to Chennai and assured her that the Centre would set up two committees to ensure the implementation of the directive that she ended her fast.-In 2014, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan hit out at the then UPA-led government at the Centre against its apathy towards farmers hit by unseasonable rain and hailstorm in several parts of the state. While criticising the government for not providing any relief to the loss caused to soybean crops, not purchasing gram crop on minimum support price and also not recognising the state as basmati rice-producing region, Chouhan had said, Our entire Cabinet would go to Delhi to apprise the Union government about the current situation. The CM also alleged that the Centre was working at the behest of the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) and also because of Pakistans opposition to the move. APEDA has joined hands with Pakistan for doing injustice to the farmers of Madhya Pradesh, he alleged.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief Chandrababu Naidu at the hunger strike. (ANI) Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief Chandrababu Naidu at the hunger strike. (ANI)-In April this year, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu held a day-long fast in Amaravati to pressurise the Centre to grant Special Category Status to the state. The CM launched the Dharma Porata Deeksha hunger strike at Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium in Vijayawada. The Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party has been at loggerheads with the BJP-led government at the Centre ever since the announcement of the Union budget. TDP leaders claimed that it was perhaps for the first time in the history of the country that the CM of a state decided to go on fast on his birthday.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Express photo by Deepak Daware) Congress chief Rahul Gandhi at Nanded village in Chandrapur district of Vidarbha. (Express photo by Deepak Daware)Congress president Raul Gandhi, on Wednesday, sought to revive the rich versus the poor narrative accusing the Narendra Modi government of helping the rich run away with crores of rupees and leaving the poor in a lurch.Addressing a village chaupal at Nanded village in Chandrapur district of Vidarbha, Gandhi directly accused Prime Minister Modi of giving away Rs 35,000 crore to diamond trader Neerav Modi, which he said was equal to the amount spent by the UPA led by the Congress to provide employment to crores of people.Rahul was addressing a sizeable crowd of people gathered for the meeting held on the occasion of his visit to the family of Dalit rice innovator late Dadaji Khobragade, who died on June 3 after a prolonged illness at the age of 79. Dadaji, studied only up to the fourth standard, was awarded for developing eight varieties of rice, the most famous and popular among them, the HMT. A winner of National Innovation Foundation award of the central institution and Krushi Bhushan Puraskar of the Maharashtra government, Dadaji had died in penury. The HMT variety, however, was allegedly appropriated by the State-run Punjabrao Krishi Vidyapeeth in 1998, when it released it under its own name PKV HMT, claiming that it had purified and stabilised it.Modiji had given away Rs 2.5 lakh crore to 15 top rich people in the country. We gave Rs 70,000 crore to countrys farmers by loan waiver in 2008. Against these Rs 2.5 lakh crore, how many jobs were created by this government, Gandhi asked, in reply to a question on unemployment by Sagar Khobragade. Would we only end up frying pakoras as this government advised? Khobragade asked. Yes, at least till 2019, Gandhi quipped.Dwelling on unemployment, he says, If they would have given Rs 5 crore to Dadaji, who had won 108 awards for his great work, he would have created jobs for 5,000 people. He added: There are many such talented people around. If they are provided with funds, they would be able to create several companies, creating huge employment.

(Express photo by Deepak Daware) Rahul was addressing a sizeable crowd of people gathered for the meeting held on the occasion of his visit to the family of Dalit rice innovator late Dadaji Khobragade. (Express photo by Deepak Daware)Gandhi followed it up by promising to set up one processing unit in each district of the country. It will facilitate direct sale of farmers produce and these units will provide jobs to local youths too, he said replying to question as to what he will do if Congress comes to power.Saying that the PM calls Neerav Modi and Mehul Chauksey his bhai, Gandhi told farmers to ask the PM as to how many jobs his pet industrialists have created. I am not saying dont help the industrialists. But help the poor too, he clarified.He then went on to bring the rising fuel prices issue to push his rich vs poor line saying, money is being pulled out of poor peoples pockets and its being paid to the rich.I will not assure you that I will put Rs 15 lakh in your pockets, but we will definitely put money into farmers pockets, he added.Referring to Gandhis loan waiver promise, a lady, Avisha Rokde, asked why not give good price so that question of loan waiver doesnt arise at all, Gandhi said, If farmers are in distress, waiver is the immediate step that needs to be taken. It gives relief to farmers. And if one person can be given Rs 35,000 crore, why cant farmers be given a loan waiver?Other measures that he promised to take included creating infrastructure to facilitate seamless journey of farm produce from farm to plate, good roads, cold storage and banks.He gave the Chinese model as an example, where industries are present in immediate neighborhood of farmers. Our computation is with China, he said.Spelling out his governments priorities on coming to power as providing jobs, solving farmers problems, providing education to children and health to the aged, he accused the PM of continually diverting attention from real issues. As against that during the days of green revolution, the whole country was focused on becoming food secure, he said, adding, The PM, instead of showing a right path to the country and make country feel assured, keeps belting out one lie after the other. He then went on to bring the rising fuel prices issue to push his rich vs poor line saying, money is being pulled out of poor peoples pockets and its being paid to the rich.

Gandhi declared that he will continue to meet people like Dadaji over the next few months.Gandhi earlier spent five minutes with the family of Dadaji  son Mitrajit, daughter-in-law Indira and grandsons Manish, Vijay and Deepak.

(File) After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. (File)Even as it is struggling to get sugar mills to discharge over Rs 12,500 crore worth of cane dues to farmers, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP administration in Uttar Pradesh can take credit on another front: Procurement of wheat by government agencies in the state for the current 2018-19 rabi marketing season has almost touched 50 lakh tonnes (lt) and looks all set to surpass the all-time-high 50.63 lt achieved in 2012-13.We will be closing procurement operations on June 15. With two more days to go and also more updated information for the previous days, the total figure will cross the 2012-13 record, a senior official from the UP Food and Civil Supplies Department told The Indian Express.He said that the state and central agencies had procured the roughly 50 lt of wheat  from the 2017-18 crop, harvested and marketed after April  from over 10 lakh farmers. We opened 5,000-odd centres in 75 districts of the state and ensured that the farmers got the official minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,735 per quintal. In addition, we gave them a Rs 10/quintal incentive for grain that was brought to the centres after proper cleaning and drying, he added.After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat from UP had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. Even during the last marketing season, official procurement touched 37 lt, as against only 8 lt during 2016-17. This year, we set a target of procuring 50 lt out of the states total 350 lt wheat production. That target will be exceeded, the official pointed out.Meanwhile, wheat procurement by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies across India had, based on information received as on Wednesday, reached 353.59 lt. This is again more than the original target of 320 lt, though below the 381.48 lt high of 2012-13. The higher-than-expected procurement this time comes in the wake of the countrys wheat output hitting a record 98.61 million tonnes (mt), surpassing the 2016-17 crop size of 98.51 mt.Besides wheat, government agencies had, as on June 11, also procured 356.81 lt of rice during the ongoing 2017-18 kharif marketing season (October-September). This is already the second highest procurement after the previous seasons 381.06 lt. For rice, too, the production of 111.62 mt in 2017-18 was the highest ever achieved by the country, ahead of the previous years 109.70 mt.Guaranteed MSP-based procurement of wheat and paddy has made the two grains the preferred growing option for farmers, especially in a scenario where prices of other crops have been prone to extreme market fluctuations. With roughly 36 per cent of the countrys wheat and 33 per cent of paddy being bought by government agencies, the market for these crops has practically ceased to be significant. That, in turn, means putting more pressure on the already stretched storage capacities of FCI and other state-run agencies.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

I start cooking after 10 a.m with the assistance of two persons. The gruel requires constant stirring to achieve proper consistency and we have to serve it hot. I stay back at the mosque till kanji is served, he said.Abdul Razack, 70, who leads the prayers in the mosque every day, says that it is ideal diet for people during fasting. It is cooked in a manner that it is easy to digest, he adds.The family of 56-year-old Mohammed Nasar, president of the Pallivasal, has been doing this service for 11 generations. It was his great grandfather Nanu Sahib who built this mosque in 1928. We have taken up this service for generations. During Ramzan month, people who pray at the mosque donate towards the preparation of kanji. The names of all the 30 donors are displayed in the mosque. They donate a minimum of Rs. 10,000 per day to buy 50 kg rice, vegetables and other ingredients required to prepare the kanjiHe added that tokens are issued to 300 people. One cauldron of rice gruel is reserved for those offering prayers at the mosque, who break their fast in the evening."

We have already deposited the amount with the Revenue Department for being disbursed as compensation to persons, whose lands are to be acquired for the by-pass road, an official of the Department told The Hindu .About 6.580 hectares of land is to be acquired for the project and the Revenue department has initiated the process of the land acquisition.We have already been issued enter upon permission, the official said. The department was currently engaged in preparing the estimates for the project which would be sent for the administrative sanction of the government. Once the administrative sanction was issued, the Highways Department would call for tenders.The process is expected to be completed within the next two months after which the work is expected to begin.Mannachanallur has been facing severe traffic congestion as the only arterial road across the town is too narrow to cater to the growing traffic. The town is rapidly emerging as a suburb of Tiruchi. Besides, the town, famous for its rice mills, also attracts a large number of lorries every day.Commercial establishments and schools are located along this narrow road and traffic snarls are witnessed right through the day. The most affected are office-goers and students. Though a one-way system is being enforced on a stretch of this road, the town is unable to accommodate heavy traffic flow for most part of the day.Recently, the Highways Department had widened three culverts along the road between Nochiyam and Mannachanallur. Once the bypass road is laid, the travel time between Tiruchi and Thuraiyur would come down significantly, officials said.Government has cleared the project and sanctioned Rs. 5 crore towards land acquisitionOfficialState Highway Department"

The government viewed doctoring of toddy as an offence. But the current punishment, five years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 50,000, was too harsh for lacing palm sap with harmless substances. Hence, the Bill proposes that the State forbear from prosecuting the offence in exchange for a fine of Rs. 25,000.However, lacing toddy with illicit spirit or other substances which enhance intoxication or cause addiction will invite the stringent provision of the law.The Assembly unanimously supported the Kerala High Court (Amendment) Bill, which sought to increase the pecuniary jurisdiction of courts.Law Minister A.K.

5b2642279855b7279ae9a41c,To the brink and back,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/to-the-brink-and-back/article24140123.ece,2018-06-12,"Less than a year ago, North Korea scored a nuclear double. In July 2017, it launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles, the first capable of reaching Alaska, and the second, the Hwasong-14, capable of reaching California. In November, it detonated its most powerful nuclear weapon  a 120 kiloton-boosted fission device.For long, North Korea had been seen as an impoverished state, run by a megalomaniac dictator, trying to punch way above its weight by defying the United Nations and the U.S. Yet, last year, it was very close to establishing a viable nuclear deterrent against the worlds biggest superpower. True, it was still perfecting the weapons miniaturisation and ensuring the missiles accuracy and safe re-entry. That might take a little more time but the U.S. has already felt deterred from taking pre-emptive military action.By late 2017, these developments had brought the world closer to a potential nuclear exchange than perhaps at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. It was not clear at that juncture whether the U.S. would attempt a strike on North Korea and how the latter would respond. Nor was it clear whether North Korea would up the ante further by firing its missiles closer to Guam or the U.S. mainland, albeit without a nuclear payload. Meanwhile, both North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump kept exchanging threats and barbs.Fortunately, matters have greatly improved since, aided by some statesman-like initiatives by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Today, Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump will sit across the table and start negotiations.The impact of sanctionsWhen North Korea pulled out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003 and intensified its nuclear programme, the UN imposed sanctions. But the North Korean regime continued to conduct missile and nuclear weapon tests, provoking the UN and the U.S. to impose more severe sanctions in the hope that North Korea would abandon its nuclear programme. But that did not happen.The prolonged sanctions have had a very serious impact on the North Korean economy. Monthly exports from the country plunged from about $240 million in 2016 to less than $50 million by the end of 2017. Exports even to China, its main trading partner, slumped last year by 81.6% year-on-year to $54.34 million. Oil supply is seriously endangered.But the resulting hardship has not caused any internal protests or revolt in North Korea, threatening Mr. Kims rule. The North Korean people have lived thorough much worse deprivation, particularly during the famine years from 1994 to 1998. The regime survived those years through a combination of a brutal internal security apparatus, political indoctrination, and tight media control.The situation is much better today. The per capita income of about $1,300 is not much lower than that of some South Asian nations. Russian, Chinese and South Korean colleagues who have visited Pyongyang in recent times tell me that the atmosphere there is not one of gloom and doom. Movie theatres are open, taxis can be seen plying the streets, and shelves in shops are reasonably well stocked. The price of rice has remained nearly constant over the past five years at around 5,000-6,000 Won (about 60 U.S. cents in the open currency market). Corn, a cheaper staple, is sold under just 24 cents per kg. The regime has also tacitly loosened its control on the marketplace, letting private production and sale of essential consumables to go on.But although North Korea has found the sanctions manageable and continued with its nuclear programme, it would certainly like to have the sanctions eased. Mr. Kim had offered to negotiate this with the U.S. directly. But Mr. Trump had dismissed such offers, both during his campaign and during his Presidency, categorically insisting that he would not even consider negotiating with the little rocket man unless the latter first got rid of his nuclear assets.Such a precondition for talks was clearly not acceptable to North Korea. Its nuclear assets had been built to address its long-standing fear of regime change attempts by the U.S. There has been a deep-rooted conviction in the successive Kim regimes that only a nuclear deterrent can keep the U.S. at bay  a view that has only been reinforced by the downfall and eventual assassination of Libyas Muammar Qaddafi after he gave up his nuclear programme.South Koreas roleFortunately, 2018 saw some Olympics diplomacy coming to the rescue. President Moon, who originally hails from North Korea and had always shown a conciliatory approach towards the North Koreans, invited the country to participate in the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February. The North Koreans responded positively. This provided the diplomatic opportunity for the two Koreas to address more serious bilateral issues as well as the stand-off with the U.S. A North-South summit was scheduled for April and, more importantly, a message was conveyed to the U.S. that Mr. Kim had expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible, that he is committed to denuclearisation, and that North Korea would refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests. In turn, Mr. Trump climbed down from his demand that Mr. Kim first dismantle his nuclear arsenal, and immediately accepted the invitation for a summit. These moves were rightly hailed the world over as acts of statesmanship on both sides. Mr. Moon also deserved a large part of the credit.The Kim-Trump talks were announced without the usual groundwork and lower-level discussions. Lack of coordination also led to some wrong signalling, with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton referring to the Libyan model for the talks. Mentioning Libya was akin to waving a red flag to the North Koreans, who angrily denounced Mr. Pence and Mr. Bolton, causing Mr. Trump to cancel the summit in retaliation. Once again Mr. Moon stepped into the breach as an intermediary and the meeting has now been restored.To Mr. Trumps credit, he has further softened his earlier demand for the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula before any lifting of sanctions and has instead settled for credible steps by North Korea towards that goal. The North is extremely unlikely to give up its entire nuclear deterrent, no matter what the inducement. Instead, it might, in stages, offer to suspend further weapon and missile tests, desist from producing more fissile materials and from non-deployment of shorter range missiles that could threaten Japan or South Korea, and perhaps work towards partial disarmament. This will enable both sides to claim success by invoking the convenient ambiguities of the word denuclearisation, even as the negotiations drag on till the U.S. congressional elections in November.R.

MudurThe archaeological site near Lahuradewa lake in eastern Uttar PradeshNew Delhi: Fossils of microscopic algae found near an ancient lake in Uttar Pradesh suggest that people cultivated paddy there about 9,000 years ago, adding fresh evidence for the independent domestication of rice in China and India, scientists have said.The scientists at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences (BSIP) in Lucknow say their study of the algae microfossils called ""diatoms"" associated with paddy fields point to the presence of cultivated rice near Lahuradewa lake in eastern Uttar Pradesh about 9,000 years ago.A team of Chinese and Canadian archaeologists had two years ago described plant remains, including residues of rice, dated to between 9,000 and 8,400 years ago, representing the earliest evidence for domestication of rice in the Yangtze valley.""The evidence from Lahuradewa supports earlier suggestions that domestication of rice occurred in parallel in China and India,"" Rakesh Tewari , a senior archaeologist and former project director of the Archaeological Survey of India's excavations at Lahuradewa told The Telegraph.Tewari, who was not associated with the new BSIP study, said differences of a few hundred years from a single site should not be used to claim domestication of rice may have taken place in India even before it did in China.Paleobotanist Biswajit Thakur and his colleagues at the BSIP analysed the distribution of diatoms across excavated areas around the Lahuradewa lake which has long been recognised as a site of ancient cultivation.""We looked specifically at the distribution of diatoms associated with paddy fields - these algae are like signatures for rice cultivation,"" Thakur told The Telegraph. ""The rise and fall in the populations of diatoms coincides beautifully with conditions conducive and not conducive for rice cultivation.""Their study, published this week in Current Science, published by the Indian Academy of Sciences, has found increases in diatoms along the margins of the lake when environmental conditions were favourable for paddy cultivation and decreases when conditions were unfavourable.The earlier excavations by Tewari and his colleagues had already recovered phytoliths, or fossil remains of rice plants, from around the Lahuradewa lake area dated up to 8,300 years ago.The BSIP researchers believe the lake's margins with between 10cm and 20cm deep water were used as paddy fields. ""Even today, we see lake margins used for paddy cultivation,"" Thakur said.Two years ago, a study by scientists at the University of Cambridge and the Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, had shown that farmers in the Indus valley civilisation had independently domesticated rice as an annual summer crop.""Rice is a staple across eastern and southeastern Asia and the subcontinent - it is possible the domestication process occurred at multiple sites,"" Tewari said."

Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."

They are ridiculing and insulting the Scheduled Castes,"" Savitri Bai Phoole told reporters in Bahraich, her constituency, on Friday.She seemed to also imply that these BJP leaders were practising untouchability. ""They hire caterers, rent utensils and deploy their own people to serve the meal. The Dalits are kept at bay,"" she said.Phoole added: ""The poor are insulted repeatedly by being reminded they are from the Scheduled Castes. I am an MP of this country but I am identified as a Scheduled Caste MP.""She suggested her party leaders should visit Dalit homes ""without prior information and eat whatever has been cooked in their kitchen, even if it is just roti and salt or rice and dal"".Her comments come at a time Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked BJP politicians to spend time in Dalit localities and instil confidence in them about the BJP.Phoole called it a sham, highlighting the government's failure to punish people who have desecrated statues of Babasaheb Ambedkar and attacked Dalits.Asked about Phoole's allegations, state BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla avoided a direct reply.""The idea is to identify localities with substantial Scheduled Caste populations that are still awaiting development. All the leaders are supposed to spend nights in those localities and mix with the people,"" he said.""I suggest the Bahraich MP follow the (party) decision so that the poor can be empowered.""Phoole's comments back up claims by many Dalits that BJP leaders had ""picnicked"" outside their homes, eating food brought from hotels or cooked by caterers.Rajnish Kumar, a Dalit from Lohgarh in Aligarh district, has alleged that state minister Suresh Rana had arrived at his home with more than 100 people at 11pm on Monday and told him they wanted to dine in front of the house.""Everything was brought from a hotel. They ate matar-paneer, pulao, tandoori roti and gulab jamuns. They drank bottled water brought from outside,"" media reports quoted Kumar as saying.Kumar said he was asked to sit in a corner and have his share of the food.Rana, however, said it was Kumar who had requested him to eat at his home. ""Some of the food was cooked by the family and some of it was brought from outside,"" he told reporters.Phoole's fellow BJP parliamentarian, Udit Raj, had said on Thursday that the outreach programme would not bring the BJP any electoral gains but would make Dalits feel ""inferior"".""Pretending through night stay and eating food... neither empowers the Dalit families nor benefits the politicians,"" he said.""Rahul Gandhi (who started the trend a decade ago) is a live example.... It would be better if politicians come forward (to provide) food, clothes, houses, employment and treatment.""On Tuesday, Union minister Uma Bharti had skipped a scheduled meal with Dalits at an event in a Madhya Pradesh village, saying she was not Ram who would purify people by eating with them.She later apologised, claiming she had not known she was supposed to eat at the event and pleading she needed to rush to an urgent appointment elsewhere. She, however, invited the Dalits to a meal at her home in Delhi.It was Rahul who started the trend of politicians eating at Dalit homes about a decade ago. He also invited friends from India and abroad to spend nights in Dalit hamlets.In 2009, Rahul and British politician David Miliband had met self-help groups in Amethi and both had spent the night at Dalit homes, prompting BJP accusations of ""showcasing India's poverty to the world"".Sting in the taleAn Uttar Pradesh minister on Friday lauded BJP leaders for visiting Dalit homes and braving ""mosquito bites the whole night"", all for the sake of educating the community about government welfare schemes.""Ministers have to face mosquito bites the whole night, still they visit the villages and feel happy about it,"" PTI quoted basic education minister Anupama Jaiswal as saying.If a minister gets an opportunity to hold two chaupals (village meetings), he wants to organise four more, she added."

First, he tosses her in the air, then pulls her onto his lap and thereafter, rocks her back and forth. But she is not interested, shrugs off his overtures and runs away.""My daughter cannot recognise me anymore,"" says Kafeel Khan, the 38-year-old paediatrician from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, who is just back home after spending eight months in jail.Zabrina was barely eleven months old when Kafeel was arrested last September. She used to crawl then; now she can walk, climb and run. She could barely say ""Papa"" then, now she can string whole sentences. Says Kafeel, ""As a paediatrician, I always tell parents, never miss the milestone moments of your child. But I have missed all her milestones. I couldn't even celebrate her first birthday.""Kafeel, who was assistant professor at Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) in Gorakhpur, and eight others were held responsible for the deaths of at least 60 infants over a span of five days.It all started on August 10, 2017, when the agency, Pushpa Sales, stopped supplying oxygen to the government-run hospital because of non-payment of dues worth Rs 68 lakh. Apparently, the company had sent 14 reminders to the authorities, including BRDMC principal Rajiv Mishra, UP health minister Siddharth Nath Singh and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to clear dues, but nobody paid any heed.Dr Kafeel Khan with his family.Pictures: Sonia SarkarWhen the hospital ran out of its supply of liquid oxygen by 7.30pm, an alert was put out on the WhatsApp group of the doctors. Kafeel was on leave, but upon getting the message he rushed to the hospital.As he goes over that day's incidents with me at his three-storey house - with an armed guard stationed at the entrance - in UP's Basantpur, Kafeel claims he called the head of the department of paediatrics, Mahima Mittal, and Mishra, but nobody responded.He says he arranged cylinders from a local hospital and a local agency. ""There was no oxygen available in the hospital from 11.30pm to 1.30am. Every day, 12-13 children were dying of premature birth or because of Japanese encephalitis. But on August 10, 30 infants died. I cannot deny that the sudden stoppage of oxygen supply was one of the reasons for these deaths.""He picks up his phone to show me an image from that fateful night. Four living infants along with a dead one cramped into a single warmer at the hospital's neo-natal intensive care unit. He also shows me screenshots of the calls he made to the higher authorities and the cash memos for the oxygen cylinders he bought from local vendors.Along with his colleagues, Kafeel procured over 250 cylinders in 48 hours. The oxygen tank finally arrived on the night of August 12. By then, television channels were running his images and hailing him as the saviour. But on August 13, when Adityanath arrived to inspect the reason for the deaths, he blasted Kafeel.""He told me, 'You are Dr Kafeel? You bought cylinders? You think you are a hero? I will see...' He thought I had informed the media about the mess in the hospital. At that point, my life turned upside down,"" he recalls.And before he knew it, Kafeel had moved from being saviour to villain. Charges of corruption were levelled at him; it was alleged that he was running a private nursing home and diverting oxygen cylinders from the medical college to this nursing home. He lost his post of nodal officer under the National Health Mission at the 100-bed acute encephalitis syndrome ward at BRDMC. Well-wishers warned him that he could be killed in an encounter.Fearing for his life, he left for Delhi on August 17 and stayed at an undisclosed location for a fortnight. Since he was untraceable, the police allegedly harassed his family. Kafeel's daai, the elderly helper at his Basantpur home, tells in chaste Bhojpuri how the cops would often come around at night, banging on their door, when no male member was present in the house. When she refused to let them in, they barged in and ransacked the house.On September 1, Kafeel's elder brother, Adeel, was detained by the special task force (STF) in Lucknow. Realising that things could get worse, Adeel asked his brother to return. Says Kafeel, ""I surrendered before the STF in Lucknow on September 2.""Illustration: Suman ChoudhuryThe STF took him to a government guest-house in Sahjanwa, 251 kilometres from Lucknow, before handing him over to the police. He says, ""They threatened to slap on me charges under the National Security Act. It was Id al-Adha that day, but I was not even allowed to offer prayers.""Here, I ask him, if he was made a scapegoat because he is a Muslim; the ideological inclinations of the Adityanath regime are, after all, known to all. He pauses. His eyes, restless and sleep-deprived, are fixed on the floor for a few seconds. ""When Mohammed Akhlaque was killed for allegedly storing beef and Junaid Khan was killed by random men during an argument over a train seat, I condemned them on Facebook. But when it happened to me..."" He does not complete his sentence.After another pause, he says, ""Only Yogi ji will tell you if my Muslim identity was the only reason for punishing me. Yes, after a point, I thought I won't be able to get out for the next five years, as long as he [Adityanath] is there.""Kafeel's wife, Shabista, and mother, Nuzhat Parveen, met the chief minister to plead his case, but all that Adityanath apparently told them was - ""Justice will be done.""The family remained silent for many months, but on April 9, when Manish Bhandari, the owner of Pushpa Sales and one of the nine accused, got bail, they realised they needed to expedite Kafeel's case.On April 18, Kafeel wrote a 10-page letter, explaining his role and appealing for justice. He wrote, ""I surrendered to save my family from humiliation and misery, thinking, when I have not done anything wrong, I should get justice.""The family released the letter to the national media. A week later, Kafeel was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court, which ruled out charges of ""negligence"" against him. ""I still consider those 48 hours [from August 10 night to August 12] more harrowing than the eight months in jail. I am out now, my mother has got her child back, but those parents will never get their kids back,"" says Kafeel.Indeed. Some of the families I spoke with are still not convinced about Kafeel's innocence. Some hospital officials believe he did nothing to save lives. It is uncertain if Kafeel will ever be back in the hospital; his suspension order is yet to be revoked. He says, ""If they call me respectfully, I will go back. But I am not desperate to join them. I have suffered so much humiliation and misery.""He plans to open a hospital to treat children suffering from Japanese encephalitis. Gorakhpur badly needs one. Right now, BRDMC is the only one that caters to ailing infants from UP, Bihar and Nepal. Primary healthcare centres in Adityanath's constituency are tardy, hence the pressure on this hospital. ""My hospital would cater to the needy,"" promises Kafeel, fiddling with his goatee.In eight months, his beard had grown longer than usual, but now the goatee is back. He is dressed in a white shirt, a pair of black trousers and a chequered tie, perhaps attired for a television interview earlier in the day. He has lost around 10 kilos.In jail, he found solace in books. He read Ken Follett's The Pillars Of The Earth, S.J. Whitcomb's The World Never Ends and Robin Sharma's Who Will Cry When You Die. Says Kafeel, ""My biggest lesson from these was, I should never run away from a situation.""Our meeting is interrupted by visitors. As he shares his ordeal with them, I enter his mother's room. She is busy surfing news channels. All these months, she has been glued to the television, hoping to hear some news related to her son's case. But they never showed anything on him, she complains, except when he was arrested and released.Even Kafeel thought people had forgotten him. But on the day of his release, hundreds greeted him carrying banners saying ""Dr Kafeel is our hero"" and ""Congratulations"". ""I realised I am no longer tainted,"" he says.It's Shab-e-Barat, the night of forgiveness for Muslims. I urge him to take a family photo before he leaves to pray. He stands next to Shabista, who has been stirring biryani rice in the kitchen. He drags an unwilling Zabrina into the frame too. In a few seconds, however, the child leaves their side and rushes to feed a cow at the main door.Looking at her fondly feeding the bovine, I wonder, what Adityanath would have to say.ttevitae1979: Khan is born to an engineer father and a homemaker mother in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh1998: Completes school from the Mahatma Gandhi Inter College there2000-2012: Completes MBBS and MD from Manipal University, Karnataka2013: Returns to Gorakhpur and joins Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) as a senior resident for three years2016: In August, is appointed assistant professor in the department of paediatrics2017: Gets embroiled in the controversy that follows the BRDMC infant deaths.

Kumaran said. ""She was disappointed and has issued a directive.""The Narendra Modi government's Swachh Bharat Mission aims at an open-defecation-free India by October 2019, and government officials and staff have often been accused of adopting strong-arm tactics to force people to build toilets.Over 82 per cent of rural households now have toilets but Puducherry has been a laggard, with 61 per cent household coverage and 23 per cent of its rural habitations free of open defecation.""It is imperative for the local community to shoulder the onus for the Swachh Bharat Grameen to become a reality. Rice distribution shall therefore be made conditional to the certificate that the village is open-defecation-free and free of strewn garbage and plastics,"" Bedi's letter to the chief minister had said.""Accordingly, I have issued directions to the director of civil supplies. A notice to the villages be given for a period of four weeks till 31st May 2018 to make the villages clean.""The state government's order asked the villagers to get the certification from their MLA and the ""commissioner of the commune panchayat"".Food rights activist Colin Gonsalves said Bedi ""thinks she is Hitler living in a dictatorship"". He added that people would be happy to build toilets if the government provided the required support. ""People who live in the governor's bungalow do not know what poverty people are living with.""Economist Jean Dreze termed the order ""ridiculous"" and ""symptomatic of the authoritarian tendencies of Swachh Bharat"".Reetika Khera, who teaches economics at IIT Delhi, said Bedi's order violated the National Food Security Act, 2013, which guarantees subsidised food for 75 per cent of the rural population.""It's not within her powers to issue an order that violates a central law. (Swachh Bharat) is a mere scheme to encourage people to set up toilets,"" she said.Kumaran pleaded ignorance about the legal validity of the order.Leo Heller, UN special rapporteur on human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, had said in his report after an India visit in November that the poor were having their ration cards revoked in some places for failing to build toilets.Civic officials in Rajasthan's Pratapgarh town had in June 2017 beaten a Muslim man to death when he tried to stop them clicking women defecating in the open - part of a name-and-shame drive.In Ranchi, civic officials seized the lungis of people defecating in the open, returning them only against written undertakings not to repeat the act.The following is the clarification issued by Bedi on Saturday night:Clarification in view of misreading of the intent of my improving the living conditions of the poor in rural areas.The intention of my direction in linking rural Open Defecation and cleanliness with free rice distribution is NOT To DENY any poor persons of their entitlement, since I have already sanctioned and directed to provide quality food grains to needy families. And the department is already in the process of procurement and distribution.The communication under comment is an expression of my serious intent and concern about addressing the root causes of health hazards in rural areas and compel performance of community and administrative leadership. To avoid misreading of this intention and in view of the forthcoming commitment made by the UT Government that villages in Puducherry will achieve ODF by June end, I am happy to give them some more time. Therefore I am WITHHOLDING my earlier communications.Meanwhile the poor and needy families will be provided their entitlement as per the law made by Central Govt and rules framed by UT Govt. We are only compelling performance of the community and administrative leadership without denying or compromising the poor of their entitlement.I am here to protect the interest of the poor, their food, health and environment the uppermost. And they know it. Which is why I have been visiting the rural areas relentlessly, every weekend, for last two years. Sometimes on their invitation and other times on their need basis. Today was the 155th weekend morning round."
5b26b60b9855b70a272afa58,The Strange Case of Reverend Perrine and Mr Hyde,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/the-strange-case-of-reverend-perrine-and-mr-hyde-225060?ref=india-new-stry,2018-04-22,"Prasun ChaudhuriFRAMED: Photograph of eastern Angami Nagas taken by Samuel Perrine (top); (above) Perrinewith wife, RosaThe cardboard box ar-rived at the desk of Geraldine Forbes almost by happenstance 40 years ago. It was from John Fuller, professor of photography at the State University of New York at Oswego, United States, where Forbes is professor emeritus in the department of History. Fuller had received the box from an antique dealer as partial payment for some photographs.Forbes, who is visiting Calcutta, tells us, ""The box contained a bewildering mix of glass plate negatives, lanternslides, negatives taped to glass, and ordinary negatives.""Once developed, they turned out to be photographs of India. Of the Himalayas, elephants, missionaries and their children, and natives before and after missionary intervention.They belonged to one Samuel Alden Perrine, who arrived in Nagaland in northeastern India in 1892 as a Baptist missionary. Perrine stayed there, travelled the length and breadth of the Northeast and returned to the United States in 1906.Last month, Forbes showed a few of these photographs at a talk, ""God and a Camera: An American Baptist Missionary in the Naga Hills"", hosted by the United States-India Educational Foundation in Calcutta.After years of searching for material on Perrine - this included a study of genealogies in the Library of Congress, US - Forbes discovered in 2009 that Perrine's grandson, Robert, lived only five miles from her home in central New York.Perrine had been an amateur photographer who clicked several pictures to document his work and travels in the Northeast. Forbes says, ""His photographs were some of the first on northeastern India to appear in the Baptist Missionary Magazine and were used in his own book, Under the Roof of the World, and in books by other missionaries.""Forbes has been using photographs as documents to write about the history of colonial India for decades. In an earlier study, she recreated the socio-political context of women here in the 1920s and 1930s based on old family photographs.She tells us how after he retired from his job as a missionary in India, and later as a pastor in New Jersey, Perrine pursued a career as a public speaker. ""Perrine used visual imagery as a tool of persuasion in his two careers - missionary and public lecturer."" Each of the Perrine Lectures - that's what his talks were called - was illustrated with ""projected coloured plates"". One flyer read: ""Ten years Among the Wild Head-Hunters"". Other lectures were more or less variations of this theme. Forbes tells us that Perrine's audience would be entertained and leave the lecture enlightened by an India expert who had experienced the country and survived ""bloodthirsty savages"" [Perrine's words] of the far east.American Baptist missionaries first made contact with the Naga hill tribes in 1837. Working in the Northeast in those days involved extreme hardships. The terrain was inhospitable and the warrior tribes, with their distinct cultures, resisted the attempts of missionaries to convert them to an alien faith.The low rate of conversion did not impress the Home Board of Baptist Missions in the US that funded missionary activities in India. Things got worse when there was a split between the northern and southern Baptists in 1845, and the subsequent outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. The economic dislocation meant there was less interest and funds for overseas missionary activity.A decade later, the Board's views changed when missionaries had some success in the conversion of the tribes in the Garo Hills and erstwhile Burma, areas not very far from the Naga hills. The renewed interest of the Board coincided with the extension of British control over the tribes. In order to protect the tea plantations and gain access to the natural resources of the hills of the Northeast, the British quelled the Naga resistance and annexed large tracts of the Naga territory.By 1872, Reverend Dr E.W. Clark, a missionary from Boston, arrived in Nagaland along with his wife, Mary Mead. By 1885, it was said of them that they were living like natives. The Clark couple had picked up local languages (Ao, Naga and Assamese), put up in a Naga-style house and established a rapport with the locals. They set up schools and churches in many villages and were able to convert a number of tribals to Christianity.Perrine arrived on the scene - in Molung, a village and the centre of Baptist missions in Nagaland - with his wife, Rosa, in 1892. He writes about how he was ""shocked by wickedness, wretchedness and heathenism"" among the tribes, but was convinced that he had made the right choice. The Perrines were not happy with their accommodations and the hardships that life in Molung entailed. Perrine himself was also not happy about Clark's converts who continued with ""their old customs such as opium-eating, smoking, drinking of rice beer and other non-Christian habits"". Soon Perrine found a supporter in fellow missionary Fred Haggard.Perrine and Haggard pitted themselves against Clark. The duo disbanded the Molung church and expelled all its members. They called for the imposition of strict temperance and tribals were told to obey the rules laid down for Christians. Also, Haggard and Perrine moved to an uninhabited site called Impur further north, and built bungalows. Perrine set up an English Language training school to educate the tribal children.Perrine realised the importance of projecting his achievements to the Board to garner support and funds. To promote this work, he wrote reports and articles and also took photographs to be published in the Baptist Missionary Magazine and other publications on missionary activity.Perrine pronounced the region ""the most manly and virile missionary ground in the [British] Empire"". He also proclaimed the Nagas of the hinterland, manly men who were ""equal, if not superior to the average American Christian"". Says Forbes, ""Perrine's writings about the Nagas presented them to his American audience as ""more manly"" than other subjects of missionary attention. Naga warriors, he argued, were like the Anglo-Saxons of Europe - strong, brave, and destined for greatness.""All this created a positive image of missionary work to American youth who viewed the field as an attractive career option, not only to prove their dedication to Christ but also for some adventure.Forbes has made one trip to Nagaland to trace the footsteps of Perrine and Clark, but has not been able to visit the place where they worked. She tells The Telegraph, ""The school Perrine established in Impur (now called Clark Memorial Higher Secondary School), still exists. Reverend Clark, whom Perrine and Haggard criticised for his failure to impose strict temperance, is the missionary most remembered by the Ao Nagas. Perrine (and Haggard who spent even less time) is seldom mentioned in the histories of the region. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that he left in 1905 and other people took over the school.""According to the last Census, Christians comprise 90 per cent of Nagaland's population. Says Forbes, ""Nagas converted Nagas. Clark, Perrine, Haggard were American Baptists and at this point, it is estimated 80 per cent of Nagas are Baptists. So, the Baptists definitely left their mark, but Nagas have also made Christianity their religion.""As a missionary, Perrine wrote and presented his side of the story of a people undergoing change. However, after retirement from missionary work, he constructed a narrative that abandoned history to focus on the heroic white man navigating a chaotic world. He portrayed the Naga hills as the new frontier to be conquered and to prove one's masculinity.Says Forbes, ""I am most concerned here with photographs as documents of history. As is evident from this example, photographs can generate different stories about the same events. In this case, the same photographs were used in the service of a missionary project and to entertain. Both are renditions of historical facts differently considered and interpreted.""Simply put, photographs don't tell the whole story. Not then, not now."

Picture by Bishwarup DuttaCalcutta: The Indian community is ""incomplete"" without Christians, just as the "" daan"" offered by a Hindu to a pandit is incomplete without salt, the head of the Methodist Church of India for the Bengal and Lucknow regions said on Tuesday.""In the Garuda Puran, it is said that when the seedha daan is offered to a guru or pandit, it should consist of rice and salt. Both in Hinduism and Christianity, salt is considered divine.... So, the Indian community is incomplete without Christians,"" Bishop Philip S. Masih said.The Garuda Puran lists various reasons why salt is endowed with divinity. Before a priest conducts a puja, a daan (offering) of uncooked rice, vegetables and salt has to be made. Without salt, the offering is incomplete.The Bishop was addressing an event at the 141-year-old Calcutta Boys' School, run by the Methodist Church of India.Among the audience and on the dais were several illustrious old boys of the central Calcutta school - such as M.J. Akbar, the minister of state for external affairs who graduated from Calcutta Boys' in 1967. Also on the dais was governor Keshari Nath Tripathi, who was a member of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.Jesus had called Christians ""the salt of the earth"", the Bishop said. ""It (salt) dissolves the same way Christians should merge with society and transform it to the level it should be.""Christian schools like Calcutta Boys' had been following the same principle, the Bishop added. ""When children come to our school, we transform them into what society will demand of them.... And that is why these Christian schools have produced scientists, artists, doctors, engineers and great persons in every field.""""In India, we (Christians) are a micro-minority. Therefore, this example of salt makes more sense in India,"" the Bishop said.""I'm interpreting what Christ had said.... Jesus said, 'Don't keep your identity but merge yourself wherever you are'.... You get merged in society and have society transformed.... That is the purpose of salt.... That is the purpose of the Christian community in India and the same is the purpose of the schools run by the Christian missionaries."""

(AFP)Chandigarh: An unusual spell of rain on Monday morning has cast a cloud on the wheat crop yet to be harvested in Punjab, forcing the agriculture department to sent teams across the state to assess the damage.The rains have come at a time Punjab has been grappling with a storage crisis.The state has a total storage capacity of approximately 153 lakh tonnes. But it can accommodate only 37 lakh tonnes of fresh stocks that are expected to be around 130 lakh tonnes.Of the total storage, 103-lakh-tonne capacity is with the Food Corporation of India, while the rest is with five state-run procurement agencies.From last year's harvest, 26 lakh tonnes of wheat and 90 lakh tonnes of rice are still lying in the warehouses.Although officially the procurement of the current stock of wheat started from April 1, sources said the bulk starts arriving by the second week of April - just when the rains have hit.The Punjab government has invited expressions of interest to arrange for cover and plinth space for wheat storage. It is also expecting the FCI to pick up the stocks lying in the warehouses by the time the fresh crop starts arriving.""If things work out as we have planned, we will manage to store between 110 and 120 lakh tonnes but anything over that would be a problem for us,"" said Anindita Mitra, director of the department of food supplies.According to the meteorological department, western disturbances caused the unseasonal rainfall in Punjab as well as Haryana.Amritsar, Pathankot, Anandpur Sahib, Nangal, Faridkot, Talwandi Sabo, Adampur, Sangrur, Kapurthala, Muktsar and Kharar in Punjab received the rainfall.""An upper air cyclonic circulation over North Pakistan caused this rainfall. There is another similar cloud formation over Haryana adjoining western Uttar Pradesh which could bring more rainfall to the area over the next few days,"" said a senior official in the Meteorological department in Chandigarh.While the drop in the temperature brought smiles in the urban areas, the farmers and the agriculture department have reasons to complain.""The damage would not be restricted to the standing crops but also the yield that is yet to be taken to the grain silos as there would be an increase in the moisture level in the crops. How the weather remains for the next couple of days will be extremely crucial,"" said Arvinder Singh, chief agriculture officer, Patiala.The Met department has forecast moderate to heavy rainfall on Tuesday.Sources in the agriculture department said they were expecting damage to 10 per cent of the wheat crop, if the inclement weather continued.""The standing crops have been flattened in most of the areas because of the strong winds that were raging since Sunday night. The minimum damage to the standing crop would be around 10 per cent. We are awaiting reports from the field,"" said Naresh Gulati, a senior officer in the agriculture department."

MudurNew Delhi: India's ""double burden"" of undernutrition and overnutrition has expanded from five to nine states over the past decade, health experts said at a conference on Friday, underscoring the need for government policies to tackle both the challenges.Nine states, including Bengal, now show a double burden of malnutrition, defined as 30 per cent or higher proportion of stunting among children below five years of age and 20 per cent or higher levels of overweight or obese women, the experts said.Government data based on samples of households from across the country show that this double burden of malnutrition was visible in only five states in 2006. (See chart)The proportion of women in India who have anaemia, or iron-deficiency, and are still overweight or obese increased from 9.3 per cent in 2006 to 15.6 per cent in 2016.""We need new interventions that can simultaneously address this double burden of malnutrition,"" said Rasmi Avula, a researcher with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). ""Much of food policies currently focus on high-calorie food to make up for calorie insufficiency, but the focus needs to shift to improving dietary diversity and the quality of food.""Paediatricians and nutrition experts speaking at the conference on the dual malnutrition burden expressed concern that diversifying the food basket would need interventions from multiple government agencies and regulations to prevent processed foods from replacing potentially healthier local traditional foods.""What we've seen in recent years is a massive disruption of our food systems,"" said Vandana Prasad, a paediatrician and a public health specialist. ""We have people consuming large amounts of rice and wheat - not enough fruits, vegetables or even milk.""""So we're facing food insecurity and undernutrition even while on the brink of an obesity epidemic,"" she said. ""Both have dire consequences on health.""While undernutrition and overnutrition may share some overlap, they need to be viewed as largely distinct problems, a senior development economist said.""The spread of junk food contributes to both undernutrition and overnutrition, so does the lack of nutrition education,"" said Jean Dreze, a visiting professor at Ranchi University.""But the overlap is limited. Undernutrition is related to poverty, inadequate food intake, healthcare and sanitation, and gender relations, among other factors. Overnutrition is associated with affluence, unhealthy food, lack of activity and other lifestyle problems - so the solutions differ widely.""But medical experts point to emerging data that show that even children from low-income households are not immune to what were once considered lifestyle-linked diseases of mainly affluent households.Paediatrician Harshpal Singh Sachdev and nutrition science specialist Umesh Kapil have found that 24 per cent of low-income households' children between the ages of 5 and 18 years in Delhi schools have impaired fasting glucose, a precursor to diabetes.""It is time we recognise that conventional body measurements showing undersized children tend to mask signals of overnutrition,"" said Sachdev. ""The focus should be on overall development  not just on calories."""

Ashok Rao, general secretary of the institute asked by the government in 2015 to conduct the survey, said the failure to address classroom hunger was affecting the quality of education. The report was submitted to the HRD ministry over a year ago but no action has been taken yet.The survey conducted in 70 schools found that for a large number of children, the midday meal is the first and main meal of the day. The data showed that 83 per cent children in primary classes and 56 per cent in upper primary classes had come to school on an empty stomach.""Their parents send them like that because they have no food at home. Since the children are on an empty stomach, they fail to focus on classroom transactions. After eating the meal, they feel sleepy and fail to focus on studies,"" Rao said.The NGO experimented by splitting the meal into light snacks, such as roasted rice or roasted chana, as soon as the students arrived and another light meal around 10.30am. ""We showed that the split is possible without spending extra money,"" Rao said.The HRD ministry spends Rs 4.13 per meal at the primary level and Rs 5.88 at the upper primary level, excluding the cost of rice or wheat.According to the SSMI study, about 25 grams of snacks costing between Re 1 and Rs 2 can be prepared in 10 to 15 minutes and served.The purpose is to break the cycle of hunger, Rao said. The study also found that about 57 per cent children had mouth ulcer, indicating Vitamin B deficiency.The study criticised the practise of supplying of food materials like rice and wheat under the public distribution system centrally instead of local procurement.Sources said HRD minister Prakash Javadekar had recently asked the department of school education to work out if breakfast could be served without diluting the midday meal. But after it was estimated that Rs 7,000 crore would be needed, no further action was taken."

Yeddyurappa's 75th birthday for the election campaign. In a clear indication of the party pitching hard for the support of farmers, Yeddyurappa was given the title ""Raitha Bandhu"" - or a ""friend of farmers"".""This corrupt Congress government must not last even a minute,"" Modi said, treading the pitch he had created at a rally in Bangalore on February 4.At the Bangalore rally, Modi had dubbed the Congress dispensation in Karnataka a ""10 per cent commission government"".On Tuesday, the rally began with a select group of farmers donating a fistful of rice cultivated by them as a sign of support for the BJP, which is seeking a desperate return to power in the first southern state to elect a government of the party.""We planned to build a statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel when I was chief minister of Gujarat.

But we are going to have a Statue of Unity (the Sardar Patel statue), which is double the height of the Statue of Liberty,"" Modi said.Narendra ModiThe Prime Minister drew a parallel between the farmers collecting a fistful of rice in Davanagere to copper pieces collected from peasants to build the State of Unity.""On our request, farmers donated pieces of copper to be smelted for the statue. In the same way, this fistful of rice will go a long way in making a new Karnataka,"" he said.""One family ruled this country for 48 years, but one chaiwala ruled for 48 months and we launched several projects for farmers and increased the minimum support price one-and-a-half times,"" Modi said.He declared that by 2022, the NDA government would double the yield of farmers by using science and technology.""The first thing we did was to launch Soil Health Cards so that farmers would know what kind of techniques to use for the best yield, thus ending wasteful expenditure and increasing output through better soil health,"" Modi said.The Prime Minister made a fervent appeal to the farmers to support the BJP in the Assembly elections and said Karnataka deserved a government that worked for the people.""The Congress government is not even spending the money that the Centre has given for various projects,"" he said, reeling out some numbers.Modi alleged that Rs 500 crore in central aid for health care, Rs 400 crore for education, Rs 100 crore for watershed development and Rs 300 crore for a smart city had not been spent.

But weeks earlier, a family had booked all but three of the 54 rooms we have during the same period,"" Joseph Mathias, the hotel's general manager, told The Telegraph on Monday.The two-story hotel at the foothills of the Chamundi Hills was built by the Maharaja of Mysore in 1931 to entertain his British guests, including the Viceroy of India. It was later handed over to the Karnataka government. Since 1973, the Indian Tourism Development Corporation has been managing the hotel.The hotel would once again change hands in March when the Karnataka government will take it over.""Since our hotel has always hosted Prime Ministers, including Modiji, and Presidents during their visits to Mysore, we know how many rooms they would need and what kind of arrangements are to be made, considering security details and food safety,"" Mathias said.""If there was any possibility of even cancelling a few bookings, we would have accommodated the Prime Minister as it is a real honour for us,"" Mathias said.The deputy commissioner's office then booked Modi and his team into Radisson Blu. ""We knew very well three rooms would not have been sufficient for the Prime Minister and his team of officials and SPG (Special Protection Group) members.

Not scarlet or rose or even ruby, but red like the blood oozing from a ruptured vessel and dripping with the sting of several lost generations. Less crop, more a byword for colonial excesses.Which is why, talk of an indigo resurgence across the subcontinent - Bengal, Uttarakhand, Assam, South India, Bangladesh - elicits a reflex cringe. The reaction that follows is really a question. Why do we need a crop that has been known to decimate son and soil?That was also the response Amrita Mukerji got from the farmers she employed when she decided to grow indigo in her smallish plot in Santiniketan. ""Don't grow these. They will harm the land,"" is how they warned her. ""When I asked them who had told them as much, they said they just knew,"" says Mukerji, founder of the NGO, Sutra.Around the turn of the century, after years of globe-trotting with her husband, Mukerji settled down to a retired life in Calcutta. She says, ""I had visited production centres in Nigeria. And over the years, attended indigo exhibitions, met scholars studying the history of the plant, bought prints... I started to fall in love with the blue of the indigo.""And then in 2003, textile researcher Charlotte Kwon met her in Calcutta and handed her a packet of indigo seeds.The indigo project was apparently a whim. That year, after harvest, Mukerji noticed that the land had yielded a rush of mustard. The farmers were surprised.They needn't have been. Indigo is a leguminous plant, fixes nitrogen to the soil, enhances soil quality and soil productivity and has been popular in India from time immemorial as a virtuous rotational crop. From 2016, Mukerji turned to indigo cultivation in all seriousness.Around the same time in Uttarakhand's Kumaon region, Rashmi Bharti was also planting indigo. In Uttarakhand, food crops are prone to pest attacks; monkeys, parrots and wild boars are also known to destroy food grains. Farmers were fed up. And that is when Bharti, co-founder of the NGO, Avani, that creates viable employment opportunities for rural men and women, thought of indigo cultivation as a sustainable alternative. And for good reason - not only is the plant hardy and low maintenance, monkeys do not like the taste of it and there is nothing to peck at for the birds either.Mukerji is aware of cultivation in Murshidabad. Bharti talks about other geographies - Bihar, Andhra, Karnataka. It might be too soon to call it a revolution, but there is a definite indigo wave sweeping India.Indigo is indigenous to India. One finds mention of it in works as diverse as the Atharva Veda and the Ain-i-Akbari. Jenny Balfour-Paul, an expert on the subject, writes in her book Indigo: Egyptian Mummies to Blue Jeans, ""The word indigo itself derives from the Greek indikon, Latinised indicum, originally meaning a substance from India, indicating the import of indigo pigment by the Graeco-Roman world. The Sanskirt word nila, meaning dark blue, spread from India eastwards into Southeast Asia and westward to the Near and Middle East, probably both through the pre-Islamic trading routes and subsequent trade diffusion of the product in the Islamic era...""In a WhatsApp call from London, Balfour-Paul tells The Telegraph that Bengal in particular produced the best quality of indigo. ""Bengal had the perfect soil to grow this tropical plant. There are 800 species of indigo, of which only 10 will yield colour. Indigofera tinctoria is what is found in Bengal.""So when and how did indigo come to be a pejorative? The East India Company was aware of the commercial worth of indigo. There were indigo plantations across colonies.In her book, Balfour writes about how the company actively promoted Bengal's indigo industry by providing heavy subsidies and underwriting initial big losses. It brought over European indigo planters from the West Indies to establish efficient factories, and Bengal indigo soon equalled in quality the finest West Indian product. ""So successful was the operation that the company's Asian indigo imports into London jumped from 25,000 pounds in 1782 (when most of the indigo came from America and West Indies) to 43,68,000 pounds in 1795, the bulk of it from Bengal.""At the time, four million people were employed in the production and manufacture of indigo in Bengal alone. Indigo was a hugely profitable enterprise. Its colour was gold.Research associate Sanjukta Ghosh of SOAS South Asia Institute, London, tells us that W.B. Hudson, a major planter in the region, claimed that 4.5 million was invested in the indigo industry. The problem started when profits were not ploughed back to the ryots or indigo farmers. She talks about the planters' ostentatious lifestyle - sprawling bungalows, obliging servants. As the returns on indigo increased, so did their greed, and a time came when they started taking away every cultivable land for indigo cultivation.Indigo might have been gold, but what is gold in the face of hunger? The aggressive push landed on the farmer's stomach, fair and square.By the mid 19th century, the exploitation had assumed monstrous proportions. In 1860, on the back of the uprising of 1857, Dina-bandhu Mitra, an employee of the Raj, wrote a play on the subject. Titled Nil Darpan, it was meant to show the mirror to the Raj, the story behind the indigo success story. In his biography of Mitra, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay wrote: ""Nil Darpan is to Bengal what Uncle Tom's Cabin is to America's slave movement.""Taking a cue from Nil Darpan, several learned men of Bengal took up the pen. One such anonymous writer's song goes thus: ""Hey nirodoy nilkargan/aar shohena praney ei nildahan/Krishaker dhoney praney/Dohile nilagune..."" The farmer writhing in agony is crying out to the indigo planters for mercy, pleading with them to rein in their indigo lust.Nil Darpan shook up British Parliament after 200 translated copies landed in Britain. It decreed that one could cultivate indigo in Bengal only if one was a landowner. Most of the planters were using leased land and when this diktat kicked in, they started looking for bluer pastures.Balfour-Paul tells us that two-fifths of the million-and-a-half acre of land that was under cultivation in India was in Bihar. She writes, ""Though the term satyagraha was coined much later in history, 'Champaran Satyagraha' began with peasants revolting against the Indigo planters.""From gold, indigo had taken the colour of death - black.Every drama must have its denouement. Indigo's was written by a German chemist. Adolf Von Baeyer invented synthetic indigo towards the end of the 19th century. It was cheaper, came minus the bloodbath and made natural indigo inconsequential.But not all the holy waters of India could wash the taint off the Blue Devil. At some point, history polluted fact and it came to be accepted, most mistakenly, that indigo was a villainous plant.Crops do not understand man-made divisions. As then, so also now, indigo is a common benison of India and Bangladesh.Ruby Ghuznavi is the founder of Aranya Crafts, an indigo enterprise based in Dhaka. She says, ""We first cultivated and extracted indigo in Bangladesh on an experimental basis in 1984. It was not very well received by the farmers because of its negative history. But once it was apparent to them that they would be the actual beneficiaries and indigo would no longer be the exploitative crop of the past, they accepted its production very eagerly. The fact that indigo as an extra crop between two major rice harvests has brought extra earnings for the farmers, is well appreciated by them.""Mishael Aziz Ahmad is also from Bangladesh, and runs the social enterprise Living Blue. He says that farmers in north Bangladesh were intercropping Indigofera tinctoria all along, as a fertiliser. Thus, in reality, indigo had never died out. What had happened was its use had changed from dye to fertiliser. Ahmad says, ""Now about 3,000 farmers in 80 to 100 villages are planting indigo in the peripheral lands. Landless labourers are also planting it by the roadside and earning a few bucks during the lull period. In Bangladesh, people have accepted it as a crop that is creating more employment opportunities.""Ahmad's account dovetails into Rashmi Bharti's. In Uttarakhand, there was a problem. Men would leave their villages for cities in search of jobs, and the women were left behind. The large tracts of unused land invited soil erosion.Indigo cultivation has addressed all these problems. Apart from the fact that it can grow at an altitude as high as 5,500 feet, indigo cultivation is not very labour intensive. Bharti's NGO has trained the women of these villages to do both. She says, ""In the first year, we had started with only 20 farmers. In 2017, we had 250 farmers. Their total earnings this year was Rs 4.6 lakh.""Avani consumes most of the produce currently as the market in India is nascent. Apart from dyeing - it is widely used in dyeing jeans - indigo is used for products such as watercolours, crayons and wood stains.Amrita Mukerji tells us that indigo is a non-pollutant and eco-friendly natural dye.In several pockets in south India, it turns out that indigo never went out of fashion. Victoria Vijayakumar, who runs Aranya Naturals, a community development project by the Tatas, tells us that indigo cultivation has been going on for generations in Munnar. It was used as manure. Vijayakumar also confirms that the renewed use of indigo for its dye is relatively recent. She tells us, ""We have six acres of land under indigo cultivation and in three years we have had 18 harvests. This year 80 kilos of indigo was extracted.""And so indigo has come full circle. From blue to gold to black to red, it is back to being a vivid blue once again. The colour of the expansive horizon, of the bottomless waters, and above all, of freedom and promise."

Officials expect government employees and general public who throng these areas to benefit from the cheap meal scheme.Christened Ekushe Annapurna, this dream project of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will be effective from May 1 in all districts. The scheme will be marketed by the West Bengal State Fishermens Cooperative Limited, which is popularly known as Benfish. The scheme was initially launched as an experiment in Kolkata from February 2017.The scheme was a grand success in Kolkata, where 20 of our battery-operated cars serve the people. Now it is time for us to spread it throughout the state. We will begin by placing the cars with meals near district magistrate offices. Gradually, the same will be extended to major crossings and government buildings, state Fisheries Minister Chandranath Sinha told The Indian Express.According to Sinha, placing the cars near DM offices will cater to not only thousands of visitors, but also hundreds of government employees. Every day, thousands visit these offices and not all of them have the financial capability to get full fish meal at a reasonable price. So keeping that in mind, we have decided to start this scheme at different state government offices in the districts, said Sinha.The minister further said, The scheme will be run on a no-profit and no-loss basis. Above all, there is 100 per cent guarantee of hygiene be it cooking or packaging. The meal at Rs 21 will come in a packet covered with a plastic jacket to prevent contamination.This project is designed to fulfil the dream of our chief minister to offer proper and nutritious food to everyone in the state. Our aim is to provide affordable fish meals in a hygienic manner, Sinha said.

It had also approached the women and child development ministry, which runs a nutrition programme for children under six.The HRD ministry was, however, reluctant because the price of dal in the open market was much lower than that offered by the NAFED.The NAFED was offering tur dal at Rs 81 a kg while the market price was Rs 55 a kg last June. The consumer affairs department then took the issue to the cabinet. The price of the NAFED dal would now be determined by a price subsidisation fund monitoring committee in case the market price is lower.Prafulla Kumar Pradhan, a teacher in a government primary school in Odisha, said the decision on pulses might lead to deterioration in the quality of food because of possible cheating by dealers.""The NAFED dal would come through the dealers under the public distribution system.""There is a chance that the dealers will sell the NAFED dal in the market and supply some poor quality dal to schools,"" Pradhan said."

(PTI)New Delhi: The 10-day farmers' strike in northern and western India ended on Sunday without any clear gains for the agitators or a significant impact on prices.During the "" gaon bandh"" agitation, the farmers had boycotted wholesale markets and tried to sell their produce directly. They were demanding a minimum support rice that would leave them with a 50 per cent profit and the waiver of farm loans.The Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and the Aam Kisan Union, which claim to represent 172 farmers' organisations across 10 states, had called the agitation to coincide with the first anniversary (June 6) of police firing killing six farmers in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh.Whatever effect the strike had on prices was seen mainly in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab - where the strike was called off on June 6 under pressure from milk producers.Mahasangh president Shiv Kumar ""Kakkaji"" Sharma insisted the strike was a success. Sharma, a former leader of the RSS-backed Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, wields clout in western Madhya Pradesh.""(We satisfied) our benchmark for success in that no untoward incident took place and that the forms of protest remained Gandhian despite threats from the police,"" he told The Telegraph.""We had learnt the lessons of last year, and instead of assembling in cities we carried out the bandh in the villages with the farmers setting up their own kiosks to sell their produce.""He added: ""In Punjab, where many farmers own large numbers of cattle, it was impossible for them to store milk. It would have been shameful if any of them were forced to commit suicide because of the strike. So, it was called off there.""He went on: ""The next time we shall organise separate agitations for milk, vegetable and fruit producers and for shorter durations. The plans for these will be finalised in Delhi on June 14.""The strike saw many farmers dump their produce on the roads, and prices rise by up to 30 per cent in places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. But the prices stabilised by June 5.Balbir Singh Rajewal, who heads one of the factions of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in Ludhiana, said: ""The bandh worked for two days. After that some elements tried to make it violent and we were forced to call it off. Farmers directly selling milk to consumers turned the middlemen against us, and there was aggression of a kind I had never seen before.""He added: ""In Faridkot, some boys started looting cars.

We aren't politicians - we can't sacrifice the lives of our boys for personal glory. Calling it off was the sensible thing.""The Left, which led the largest peasant agitations in recent memory in Rajasthan and Maharashtra, stayed away from the strike.""We are part of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee - of more than 180 organisations - which has been leading the peasants' movement for a year now.

In addition to yielding four bags more than other varieties, Dhan 44 has withstood well the long dry spells. ICRISAT is giving 50 % input subsidy to identified farmers.Consortium approachThe consortium approach has evoked a good response with tribal farmers coming forward to cultivate new varieties of paddy, pulses and other crops.This project has been taken up under Rythu Kosam in Andhra Pradesh (AP Primary Sector Mission) and trials were conducted by ICRISAT under the guidance of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) located on its campus in Hyderabad with the help of the Andhra Pradesh Agriculture Department, the IIRR, and ASDS, an NGO.Cooking quality of this variety has also been found good like basmati. This variety yields more under minimal fertilizer application making it most suitable for the Agency area where farmers dont buy much fertilizer. This year, more farmers have came forward to take part in participatory demonstrations. IRRI senior scientist A. Narayana Rao said with the confidence gained from the VR Puram demonstrations, the approach will be tried out in Gangavaram and Y Ramavaram mandals in the East Godavari Agency area.Spreading the wordInteracting with the farmers of Gangavaram and Yarlagadda villages, he highlighted the success stories of DRR Dhan 44 and other varieties in VR Puram mandal. About 20 farmers, four groups, five members in each group came forward to participate in the demonstration during kharif 2018 with DRR Dhan 44, KNM 118, RNR 15048 and DRR Dhan 46 along with other crops such as sorghum, ragi, and groundnut which are being upscaled in these mandals for the last two years. Rajesh Nune, visiting scientist, ICRISAT, said there was a possibility of growing green manure and chickpea during the rabi season if cattle were constrained to non-crop areas for grazing. He suggested setting up of community groups to prevent cattle from entering fields."

Roadside vendors are selling colourful glass and lacquer bangles, assorted fruits, mounds of dry fruits and bags filled with sewai or vermicelli.There is a faint aroma of ghee that clings to the air. Bundles upon bundles of uncooked sewai lie on tabletops of makeshift stalls. Off-white, paper white, yellow, light brown. Men and women carrying huge shopping bags haggle with the vendors for their dose of this season's sweetness. Indeed, in the grand Eid spread of sheermal paratha, galauti kababs, biryani, mutton chaanp, sewai is the lone sweet note.The scene at Zakaria Street is no different from Mullickbazar that evening. There is still a week to go before Eid. Shop owner Mohamad Eiyaz is taking an iftar break. His son, Shahnawaz, a college student, is filling in for his father. The shop that sells stationery all year also sells sewai during this time.Shahnawaz tells us that they source it from a factory in Metiabruz on the outskirts of the city. And not just them, the paanwala, the man frying samosas, another manning a bag shop, all jump onto the sewai bandwagon at this time.Qudimi Karkhana Sewai is different in that it sells sewai throughout the year. ""What do you want - bhuna, mota, Banarasi, lachcha,"" asks Syed Feroze, who works at the 200-year-old shop, in between measuring a heap of lachcha for a customer. The lachcha is very fine of texture, looks like a heap of hay. It is basically made of rice or refined flour or semolina kneaded with ghee.""The mota sewai comes from Lucknow, the Banarasi one from Benaras and the lachcha is made right here in the city,"" says Feroze, as he stashes the payment into a tin tiffin box. The finest and the most expensive of the lot is the Banarasi sewai. ""What Basmati is to rice, Banarasi is to sewai,"" explains Shahanshah Mirza, a food connoisseur. He adds, ""An Eid without sewai is considered incomplete.""Athar Ali, the 25-year-old owner of a garment shop in Chitpur, says that most people start to stack up sewai before the beginning of Ramzan, and consume it intermittently that whole month. Mirza says, ""Chand raat marks the end of Ramzan and a lot of people buy sewai especially then because the next day is Eid.""The menu at most Mughlai eateries comprises firni and shaahi tukda and not sewai; it is the preserve of home kitchens and makes an appearance only on special occasions.There is no one way of preparing sewai, we are given to understand. The lachcha is usually doused in a bowl of milk and had with a sprinkling of sugar. ""A lot of people have it thus during sehri. It is filling and keeps one going all through the day,"" says Athar Ali.We learn from homemaker Shagufta Bano, a resident of Howrah, that every family has its own version of the sewai, most of them going back several generations. ""You could boil it in milk, cook it in chashni or sugar syrup, or deep fry it in ghee..."" she rattles away.Shagufta adds a generous pinch of jafran (saffron) to her version. First, she adds sugar in desi ghee, then water and, thereafter, some jafran for an orange tinge. Then she adds the raw sewai to this mix, throws in kaju, kishmish, pista, badaam and khoa. And a drop or two of meetha attar.What Shagufta prepares is called the qimami sewai. There is also the sheer khurma, a sweet pudding made of milk, sewai, dried dates and sugar. Be it meethi sewai, sheer khurma or rumali sewai, the slight variations are most likely in the DNA of the dish - place of origin and consequent availability of ingredients.Manzilat Fatima, a preserver of royal Awadhi family cuisine and a food curator, tells us about a sewai dish called muzaffar. ""It is an age-old preparation, not so common in every home. One needs considerable expertise to achieve the balance of moisture in the sewai and at the same time maintain the individual strands of vermicelli,"" says Fatima.Vermicelli does not have much of a flavour of its own, and so it readily absorbs the flavours of the ingredients it is cooked with. That is why it can be added to dishes sweet and savoury alike.Chef Deepak Raj Srivastava of Pukhtaan, a restaurant in Patna specialising in Awadhi cuisine, tells The Telegraph over phone that sewai is also used to make savoury items, cutlets and potato rolls. In these cases, the vermicelli acts as a coating, lending a certain texture to the dish.A dessert usually comes at the end of a meal. But in a manner, the sewai is an exception. Something sweet is partaken of before namaaz on Eid. Says Athar, ""Having something sweet before the Eid prayers is sunnat, which means respecting the Prophet. Some households have dry dates and milk without sugar and some prefer sewai."" It is also among the first few dishes offered to guests on Eid day, we are told - to sweeten relations."

Express file Farmers will be encouraged to grow non-Indrayani rice varieties. Express fileTribal farmers in Pune district cultivating rice would soon get access to markets dominated by branded rice. District authorities have taken up a special scheme for such farmers that aims to commercialise rice cultivation in the area and sell it under a brand in urban markets such as Pune and Mumbai.Ayush Prasad, assistant collector and sub-divisional magistrate of Khed, said the scheme would be implemented among the tribal farmers of Khed, Ambegaon, Junnar and Maval. Farmers in these areas have long been cultivating rice but mostly for sustenance, cultivating enough to feed themselves. Also, majority of the farmers in these areas generally go for the common Indrayani rice variety, which is not a niche product, he said.Aimed at bettering the income of farmers, the scheme will go into operation during the upcoming kharif season. Under the scheme, farmers will be encouraged to grow non-Indrayani rice varieties, which will then be branded and marketed.The Sahyadri School in Khed runs a special conservation scheme for rice and have around 40 varieties. The nursery has rice meant for children, porridge etc. These special varieties of rice, marketed well, will surely fetch a premium for the farmers, Prasad said.The rice produced will be marketed and sold under a brand name and B-school students will be roped in for the task. We will offer paid internship to students to help us explore markets and create a brand, he said. Also, district authorities plan to tap organised retail to help them market this rice in urban markets.In the first phase, the district authorities aim to mobilise farmers to shift to cultivation of non-Indrayani rice varieties. Gram sevaks, village-level agricultural assistants and others will be roped in to spread awareness about the move. Self-Help Groups of farmers will be formed and, at the taluka level, a farmers producer company (FPC) will be established to help farmers market their produce. Prasad said in the initial stages, the Sahyadri School would provide seeds to farmers.The step, to be first tried out among around 500 farmers in Khed, will aim for organic cultivation of rice with no chemical inputs used. This will make the produce niche and command a premium, he said. A rice mill and packaging facilities will be provided.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

And in that context Xi told Modi that China is looking at enhancing agricultural exports from India including non-Basmati rice and sugar,"" Gokhale said.An agreement was signed between China's General Administration of Customs and India's Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare on Phytosanitary requirements for exporting rice from India to China, one of the world's biggest rice markets.The 2006 Protocol on Phytosanitary Requirements for Exporting Rice from India to China has been amended to include the export of non-Basmati varieties of rice from India.At present, India can only export Basmati rice to China.A couple of business delegations from India and the department of commerce have visited China in the recent months and it is hoped that this will lead to additional imports from India this year, he said.""The Chinese side also said that it will encourage our pharmaceutical companies to register for high-quality Indian pharma products in the Chinese market. This was an important aspect from our perspective because we have been pressing for greater pharma exports into the country,"" the foreign secretary said.In response to the president's suggestion for enhancing financial cooperation between the two countries and also helping trade, the Prime Minister conveyed to President Xi India's readiness to permit the Bank of China to establish its branch in Mumbai,"" Gokhale said.China has been promising to address the issue of trade deficit with India which has been seeking a greater market access for its goods and services in China.Trade deficit with China stood at USD 36.73 billion during April-October this fiscal.India's trade deficit with China has marginally dipped to USD 51 billion in 2016-17 from USD 52.69 billion in the previous fiscal.India has been pressing China to open the IT and pharmaceutical sectors for Indian firms to reduce the massive trade deficit."

5b280baf9855b72a21251ba0,Build quickly on the Wuhan spirit,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/build-quickly-wuhan-spirit-674991.html,2018-06-14,"In their first interaction after the informal summit in late April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping signalled that the co-operative spirit on display at Wuhan remains very much alive. At a meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) summit at Qingdao in China, New Delhi and Beijing took some steps forward to address issues of concern to the two countries. One issue was the Brahmaputra river hydrological data. China had suspended sharing this data with India in the wake of the Doklam crisis last year. At Qingdao, China agreed to resume sharing of hydrological data on the Brahmaputra during the flood season and when the water-level exceeds mutually agreed levels during the non-flood months. Provision of such data will help Indias preparedness to deal with flooding of the Brahmaputra river. Another issue of concern for Delhi has been the ballooning trade deficit between India and China. According to Indias Ministry of Commerce, this deficit has increased from $16 billion in 2007-08 to 51 billion in 2016-17. India has repeatedly raised this issue with China, including at the Wuhan summit. Beijing has finally responded. It has agreed to import non-Basmati rice from India. This is a beginning towards narrowing the trade deficit to some extent.Of the SCO members, India is the only country that is opposed to Chinas ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. Speaking at the summit, Prime Minister Modi stressed that India was supportive of connectivity projects and is a part of several such initiatives, including the International North-South Transport Corridor project. However, he asserted that Delhi will stay away from initiatives that undermine Indias sovereignty.At the Wuhan summit, India and China announced their decision to co-operate on a joint economic project in Afghanistan. Such a project would help build trust between the two countries. However, little has been heard on this since then. Delhi and Beijing have kept alive the Wuhan spirit, but it is important that they keep up the momentum generated at that summit. Some years ago, too, India and China had mooted working on a joint project in Afghanistan but that did not take off. It would be a pity if the present plan meets a similar fate. Given the solid work it has put in on the ground in Afghanistan, India should take the initiative to explore options and ideas for the joint economic project. The summits at Wuhan and Qingdao have provided a strong foundation on which India and China have reset their relations. They must follow up on promises made at these summits to ensure that the reset survives."
5b280be69855b72a21251ba8,Biofuels policy serves many goals,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/biofuels-policy-serves-many-goals-673521.html,2018-06-05,"The new national biofuels policy, approved by the Union cabinet recently, has an economic rationale and an environmental dimension. The policy is aimed at expanding the sources of biofuels and increasing their production when conventional fuels like oil are becoming costly. The policy will help to boost the production of biofuels like ethanol by allowing their production from a wider range of raw materials. Till now, only molasses derived from sugarcane could be used for ethanol production. The new policy allows it to be produced from sugar beet, corn, damaged food grains, vegetables like potatoes and crop residue such as wheat and rice stubble and urban and rural solid waste. Farmers can sell their excess produce to ethanol-making units with permission from a committee specially set up for the purpose. Ethanol is blended with petrol so that the consumption of petrol can be reduced. Biodiesel is also produced to cut down on the use of diesel.Most of the raw material that can be used as feedstock for biofuels is going waste now. Farmers can gain additional income by selling them to biofuel producers. Biofuels can also be produced at less cost than now. At present, oil companies find it difficult to get ethanol at economical prices because sugar factories sell it to alcohol producers at higher prices. The use of solid waste and crop stubble for biofuel production will benefit the environment as it will reduce pollution. The hazards of burning crop stubble and the problems of solid waste management are well-known. It is estimated that the availability of ethanol, which is about 2 billion litres now, can be increased to over 40 billion litres in a few years if production is scaled up with multiple feedstock. There is a plan to set up 12 major biofuel refineries which will sell ethanol to oil companies.While the policy and the plans based on it are welcome, they may face major challenges. The technology to make ethanol from feedstock other than sugar molasses is still under development. High investments are needed for setting up biofuel refineries. The logistics of and the infrastructure for collection of feedstock from farms, homes and other places are formidable. There is also the likelihood of misuse of the policy. Sugarcane may be diverted for production of ethanol instead of sugar when sugar prices are low. Similarly, food grains may be used for ethanol production instead of surplus or damaged food grains. The same possibility exists with vegetables also. This will have serious consequences on food security. So, the implementation of the policy should be monitored to avoid unintended and undesirable consequences."
5b280d899855b72a21251bc8,Amma Canteen orphaned after Jayalalithaa’s death,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/amma-canteen-orphaned-after-jayalalithaa-s-death-674474.html,2018-06-11,"Amma Unavagam, the heavily subsidised food scheme that served as an inspiration to Bengalurus Indira Canteen and several such initiatives across India, is fast losing steam due to laxity in its implementation and poor patronage by the public.The Amma Canteen, touted as the biggest welfare programme launched by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa in 2013, is facing many challenges, 17 months after her death in December 2016. Lack of quality checks, infrequent inspection by officials of municipal corporations, deterioration in quality of the food served and severe funds crunch are some of the reasons that seem to have let down the low-cost food joints that allow a person to have three-square meals for a mere Rs 30.Corporations and municipal bodies being headless since October 2016 due to non-conduct of local body elections is also being cited as another reason for poor implementation of the welfare programme that was replicated with slight modifications in several states like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi. At the Amma Canteen, idlis are priced at Re 1 each, curd rice at Rs 3, sambar rice at Rs 5, or you can have two chappatis with dal for Rs 3.Non-governmental organisations and RTI activists who have been monitoring the functioning of the Amma Canteen allege that the government has scaled down spending on the food joints, resulting in decline in the quality of food served.Chennai city alone has 200 of these canteens, while another 207 are spread across Tamil Nadu, and they all have had one thing in common in the past 17 months  lack of patronage from people, with almost all outlets reporting steep decline in sales. Sources in the municipal corporations told DH that the revenue from Amma Canteen has almost halved in the past two years.But the civic bodies are not ready to pump in more money into the scheme since there is no pressure from the top to run these outlets, sources said, adding that Jayalalithaa ensured that these canteens were allotted enough money so that the quality of food was not compromised.Many outlets that this correspondent visited wore a deserted look even during busy hours. We used to make at least Rs 6,000 a day till 2016, but things have changed drastically in the past one-and-a-half years. Now, our daily sales dont exceed Rs 2,500. It has been months since I saw a rush of people in the canteen, a staffer at one Amma Canteen in Chennai said.Former Chennai mayor Saidai S Duraisamy, the man who introduced the concept of Amma Canteen much before it was adopted by his leader Jayalalithaa, says the canteens were hugely successful till the late chief minister was alive.Amma Canteen is my brainchild. I opened the first outlet in Saidapet in 2006 and when I took over as Chennai mayor in 2011, I decided to open one canteen in each of the 200 wards in the city. The motive was to provide quality and inexpensive food to the masses and create job opportunities for women folk. But now, the programme is not being implemented properly, Duraisamy told DH.The former mayor said dedication and fear of surprise inspection by top officials, including him as the head of the Chennai city corporation, was the hallmark of the programme, which is completely lacking now. He also dismissed suggestions that these outlets are difficult to sustain and that municipal bodies are bleeding since they allocate a sizeable chunk of funds to keep these outlets afloat.If it is implemented properly, there is no way that it cannot be sustainable. How did we run the canteens successfully for more than three years? Did we ever complain about sustainability or lack of funds? The will is lacking now. Officials should be proactive in ensuring that these canteens are restored to their initial glory, he said.Rejecting talk of poor implementation and deterioration in quality of food, Municipal Administration Minister S P Velumani told DH that the canteens are still popular as they were during Jayalalithaas time. The minister said he personally undertook inspections to check quality of food and running of the canteens after such complaints.There is no such situation in any Amma Canteen outlet. I personally went on surprise inspections to a few outlets and I found them to be doing fine. We also constituted teams to check the quality of raw materials used and they were also satisfied with the running of the canteens, Velumani said.Even if I get a complaint about one outlet, we will go into it in detail since it is a major scheme of the government, he said.Duraisamy says the canteens can be made more popular again within days if the discrepancies are attended to on a war-footing. It is never too late. If the officials concentrate on the implementation, Amma Canteen can again be run well, Duraisamy said.At least among migrants coming into Chennai for a variety of reasons, the canteens are still a hit. Experts feel the government should find ways to ensure sustainability of the canteens, it need not make profits out of a welfare programme.J Jeyaranjan of the Institute for Development Alternatives (IDA), Chennai, says everything depends of the attitude of the implementing agency and, in this case, the state government. These canteens are a great boon to the urban poor, many of them migrants. Since a city like Chennai attracts migrant and floating population, such canteens become their primary source of food. This helps people in the lower economic strata.Migrants dont get subsidised food materials under the Public Distribution System (PDS), but the Amma Canteen outlets ensure they dont have go without food. I think it is sustainable. When governments in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana can run such canteens, why cant Tamil Nadu? he asked."

During her journey from home in Tailbal on the outskirts of Srinagar till she reaches her destination, only one thought plays on her mindto quickly sell off the fresh catch.While catching fish is the responsibility of her husband, Begum, like all other women of her community, knows the art of selling it in various markets of Srinagar better than men of their tribe. Men of our community go out late in the evening for fishing and after hard toil, they return with the catch. We share the responsibility of selling the fish as men cant work day and night, Begum, who has been selling fish for 20 years, told DH while sitting on a pavement of Amirakadal Bridge.This is our routine, irrespective of summer or winter or rough or harsh weather. We have been doing it for generations, she says. But despite toiling hard, the community doesnt reap all the profits. Production of fish declines during winter when the demand is actually more. During summer, the production increases, the demand for fish decreases and with that prices plummet, she said.Traditional fish consumers in Kashmir are largely inspired by folklore that fish be consumed in months which bear alphabet R. And hence, from May to August, fish is rarely consumed.No one knows from where this logic came but our family has been following this logic of cooking fish for generations, said Rabiya, a resident of nearby Maharaj Bazar.For Zoona life goes on, but full of struggle. Dressed in traditional attire, especially her eye-catching earrings, Zoona says she grew up listening to her mother saying that selling a few kilos of fish in a day brings a plateful of rice at night. However, she hopes that her children dont have to carry on the profession of their forefathers as there is no respect for us.We sit on the roadside where we sell fish during harsh summer and winter months. Then we have to fight with municipal corporation workers and policemen, who force us to vacate the pavements. And even the customers look down on us. They virtually treat us like beggars. I dont want any of my children to take up this profession, where there is no dignity of labour or assured returns, Begum rued.If there are designated fish markets in Jammu and Delhi, why cant there be one here, she asked. Being members of one of the first professions where women stepped out of their homes to earn in Kashmir, there is a certain historical and social significance attached to these fisherwomen. Still, most of these fisherwomen dont want their children to carry forward the family trade.Jigari Begum or Jigar Mass as she is fondly called, who like Zoona sells fish in the same market, says there are only hardships for fishermen community.There is no dignity in doing this work anymore. When the police beat us and throw away our fish, people gather to look at us as if some street show is going on. Where will we go to sell our catch? Instead of helping us, the government creates more hardships for us, she complained.Though in 2014, the government had planned to provide permanent space for the fish market, there has been no forward movement till now. At the end of a gruelling day, all that fisherwomen like Jigari get for their hard labour are a few hundred rupees.Jigari says she has worked hard to educate her children and if her son gets a job, she will leave her profession. From catching to selling fish is hard work and requires a lot of stamina. My husband often has blisters and sores due to staying in the water for long hours. We dont want our children to suffer the same way, she says.There are more than 2,000 families that depend on fishing in the Dal Lake for their livelihood. But a majority of them live in dismal conditions in slum-like colonies along the wasteland in the interiors of the lake.As low profits, harsh winter weather, a declining fish population and lack of government support have made it a trying profession, many youth are not taking up traditional fishing as means of livelihood.The challenges of catching and selling fish have a deterrent effect on younger generation from carrying forward the traditional profession. If the government fails to take immediate measures for welfare and promotion of fishermen community, soon this profession will vanish in Kashmir, says Shabir Ahmad, a young fisherman from Dal lake area.Over last decade or so, this trade has received a setback as youth from our community have started opting for other alternatives. They dont find fishing profitable, he said.Zahir-ud-Din, a senior journalist in Kashmir who has been keenly monitoring fisherwomen at Amira Kadal, says he is surprised that government or even NGOs have neglected fishermen community in welfare measures.For women like Jigar and Zoona, their lives continue to be a struggle."

The heat doesnt wear the third-generation farmer down as he doubles as tour guide, sharing stories that have marked the farms history over 125 years.This, however, is not quite the familiar story of farming generations cultivating crop on inherited property  at the 18-acre Navara Eco Farm (NEF), on the banks of river Shokanashini (destroyer of sorrows) in Chittur, Unny cultivates Navara, a nearly extinct variety of medicinal rice endemic to Kerala and noted for its use in Ayurveda.Over the 23 years since he took over the property after the death of his father M Ramachandra Menon, Unny has developed the farm into clusters for specialty rice varieties and secured Geographical Indication (GI) tags for two of them. He has adopted organic practices on the farm and has initiated a farmers collective engaged in research and awareness campaigns.During Menons time (he managed the farm for about 60 years), the main crops were rice varieties, including the Palakkadan Matta. In the late 1970s, also influenced by The One-Straw Revolution  the best-selling book by Japanese farmer-philosopher Masanobu Fukuoka  he moved away from the use of chemical fertilisers.I was running a business in Kozhikode when I had to make the switch to farming. At the time, it did not make a lot of economic sense and there were other challenges  low returns and the non-availability of pure seeds, for instance. But I also wanted to explore the idea of specialty rice varieties and since Navara is both medicine and food, the approach was always going to be organic, says Unny.The focus on Navara was firmed up around the year 2000, with 15 cents of the farm initially earmarked for its cultivation. It took another couple of years to get to the first batch of purified seeds.Navara is a variety of red, shashtika (it matures in 60 days) rice with a recorded history of over 2,000 years. It comes in two glume varieties  black and golden-yellow. Seeds for the seasonal, 60-day crop are typically sown around December. At NEF, Navara is cultivated on 24 acres (twice a year, on a 12-acre stretch). In Ayurveda, the rice is put to use in two prominent regimens of treatment Navarakkizhi (a form of massage that uses rice boiled in a decoction, wrapped in cloth pouches) and Navaratheppu (application of a paste made from rice boiled in a decoction).These methods have proved effective in the treatment of arthritis and paralysis. Theres also the Navarakkanji (gruel made with the rice) consumed during the monsoon months in Kerala. The rice improves levels of immunity when its at the lowest, during the monsoon. The Navara rice bran helps in the treatment of mouth ulcers and the rice roots are being used to treat urinary infections, says Unny.The rice variety is also used to prepare traditional foods including puttu, payasam and kozhukkatta. Cultivation of Navara, despite its well-documented medicinal values, has remained limited to pockets in the state due to scarcity of pure seeds and high production costs.Plants on the farm are used for manure, along with green leaves. The all-organic mode adopted in cultivation also extends to pest control. Tulsi and marigold are planted on the bunds to keep the pests away. Indigenous, if unconventional, methods are followed to counter pests like the chaazhi (earhead bug)  a case in point is the conical net used by workers in the farm to catch the pests.The earhead bugs, an old menace, once damaged Navara crop on four acres in the farm. Then, theres the problem of rats and boars. Maintenance also becomes a tough ask with a limited workforce.NEF (www.navara.in), however, is moving beyond logistic hiccups  it has diversified into value-added products and now leads a movement to conserve Navara. In 2006, the farm and its products were certified organic. Since 2008, its in the market as brand UNF (Unnys Navara Farm), with rice, rice flakes and rice powder.The branded Navara wellness rice is priced Rs 460 per kg while the rice flakes and rice powder are priced Rs 720 and Rs 600, respectively. The farm delivers all the products based on orders placed by the customers. NEF has tied up with dealers in cities, including Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai, and it delivers orders to different parts of the country. The farm did offer the provision of online shopping till July last year but suspended it following implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Unny says hell need some more clarity on GST before resuming the e-shopping service.Navara is among the first agricultural products in the country to obtain a GI registration (certified in 2007) through a farmer-led movement. We are now extensively engaged in conducting awareness programmes and are trying to ensure that the farmers also benefit from the premium their products carry. The idea is to prepare the community to counter the threats of biopiracy. Collaborations with the industry and experts in agriculture have helped in taking the movement forward, says Unny.NEF has generated interest from farming enthusiasts, leading Unny to more possibilities to diversify. A Navara rice museum is on the cards and plans are on for organised farm tours and a home-stay facility.Weve been getting enquiries for sometime but were waiting for things to fall in place. The plan is to package the visitors stay as an experience that traces life on the farm, he says."

(Express photo by Partha Paul) Satyen completed his Ladakh journey in 3 months. (Express photo by Partha Paul)Written by Poojaa MukherjeeIn May, Kolkata-based documentary filmmaker Indrani Chakrabartis 64-minute film Ladakh Chale Rickshawala won the Best Exploration/Adventure film at the 65th National Awards in New Delhi. The film documented the journey of a rickshawala, 46-year-old Satyen Das, from Kolkata to Ladakh.I have had many job offers since the award, and even before that as people in this area (Naktala) know about my adventures, Das, who is fluent in Bengali, Hindi and English, told The Indian Express. I have been offered money to open a stall of my own. Shop owners have offered to hire me. But I like my life. I own my own rickshaw and ply it the way I want. I dont have a boss, I am not accountable to anyone and I can go travelling whenever I want.At 9 am every day Das arrives at the Gitanjali Metro station at Naktala and leaves for home 12 hours later. A shack near Naktala is home to Dass family  his wife Meenu works as a maid and 14-year-old daughter Sukanya studies in a government school. It is also home to Dass vast reputation  a neat folder will all the certificates from various government departments he has ever received and a collection of around 100 stamped police permits from all over India.I want to become a mountaineer, Sukanya said to the approving gaze of her father. She will climb Everest one day, said Das. The family climbs a mountain every day with Das earning around Rs 300 each day and Meenus monthly Rs 5,000. For the award-winning film, Das got Rs 15,000 as remuneration. His travels had been taking him across the country.In 1995, after years of work and saving money, he travelled through much of India in 403 days  from Kolkata to Puri in Orissa and then from there going down south then back up through Rajasthan to Jammu on a cycle. It set the tone of Dass annual adventures.In 2007, he took Meenu and Sukanya, who was just over a year old then, to Puri (Odisha) on his rickshaw. We carried a sack of potatoes and rice and would cook on the journey and eat. We had only Rs 1000 in cash and used it to fix tyre punctures and repairs which needed to be done, said Das. We caught sleep at railway stations, schools and even in peoples homes when they allowed us shelter. Some of them would give us food and money too when they heard our story. People are very kind.The next year he peddled to Rohtang Pass (altitude 3,978 m) and found his way to the Limca Book of Records. It was sheer luck that brought Indrani Chakrabarti and Das together. I had taken a ride on his rickshaw and struck a conversation, she said. When he told me his story I knew then it had to be shown to a wider audience.The Ladakh trip saw him come close to a snow leopard, suffer a drop in oxygen and navigate through uneven terrain. On the way, he planted close to 5,000 date seeds. They dont need much nurturing and will grow in adverse circumstances. Its like human willpower, he said.I stayed at Sonam Wanchuk School in Ladakh, he said. Sonam sir kept my rickshaw there to inspire people who would come. He also gave me advice regarding my rickshaws gear. He is an incredible man. He arranged for a flight ticket to Delhi despite me wanting to take a bus from Ladakh. He even gave me Rs 5,000 for returning to Kolkata.Back home, the local community felicitated him and even refurbished his rickshaw with a special brake.The members of the Naktala Agrani Sangha (the local club) helped me in all possible ways by raising funds. They upgraded my humble rickshaw with suitable break and gear too. Ive received both love and recognition, Im grateful for that, he said.Das has taken to learning and educating people on global warming. He scours newspapers, social media and follows National Geographic keenly. We live in a beautiful world but are bent on destroying it, he said.Meanwhile, he has already planned his next trip  to Umlingla Top in Ladakh which stands at 18,406 ft, the highest motorable Road in India. And this time he plans to take 20,000 date seeds with him.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"
