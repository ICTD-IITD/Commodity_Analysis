It only cares for the countrys 15 top industrialists and has provided them with a Rs 2.5-lakh crore corporate loan waiver. It will do nothing for poor farmers, he added.Gandhi said that while waiving loans is not the ultimate solution, there are times when it becomes necessary. If the Congress comes to power, it will ensure that farmers get their due. The long-term solution lies in creating farm infrastructure  roads, markets, cold storages and food proceedings units  so that farmers can get better price for their produce, he said.The Congress chief said he prefers to have a dialogue with people instead of just delivering speeches. I will not make any false promises like Modi. I have just come here to tell you that if elected, we will do everything needed to rebuild your confidence, he promised during his 20-minute interaction with the villagers.Gandhi visited Nanded, located in the states paddy belt, to pay his tributes to a farmer and rice researcher who had died in penury on June 3. Dadaji Khobragade, who had invented the HMT variety of rice, received some media attention when a popular magazine named him among Indias seven most powerful entrepreneurs in 2010.However, Khobragade was unable to afford medical treatment following a paralytic attack in his last days. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis sanctioned Rs 2.5 lakh for his medical treatment, but the farmer had already passed away at a private hospital in Gadchirolis Chandgaon village by then.Gandhi said the erstwhile Congress-led UPA government had been providing Rs 35,000 crore in funds for rural employment every year while the Modi government allowed the transfer of a similar amount to a single businessman, Nirav Modi, who then fled the country.The Modi government waived industrial loans amounting to Rs 2.5 lakh crore in a bid to appease the countrys top 15 industrial families, but is not ready to help crisis-ridden farmers, he said. The Congress government, on the other hand, had waived over Rs 70,000 crore in farm loans across the country, he added.Gandhi said the Modi government has betrayed both farmers and youth by neither providing them with remunerative rates for agricultural produce nor employment opportunities in the last four years. The Congress, if voted to power in 2019, will provide on both counts, he said.Gandhi said his party will work on four fronts  agriculture, health, education and industry  on a priority basis to ensure a prosperous India.Earlier, he visited Khobragades residence and offered condolences to his bereaved family. Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Chavan and senior party leaders Ashok Gehlot and Mohan Prakash were also present on the occasion.The state Congress and a few party leaders, including Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil and Naresh Pugalia, gifted Rs 8.5 lakh to Khobragades family and promised a government job to one of his relatives if voted to power."

It was unprecedented, so we had no references to draw on. (Illustration: CR Sasikumar) We were unaware and blindsided by the consequences of pollution. It was unprecedented, so we had no references to draw on. (Illustration: CR Sasikumar)MOTTAINAI is a Japanese word that literally means wasteful. It is used to express dismay at wasteful actions. This single word clearly conveys the feeling of veneration that the Japanese people have towards the environment, and their firm resolve to protect it. Indeed, the spirit of mottainai is embedded in the DNA of the Japanese people.I believe many Indians are now familiar with this word too. Some have been introduced to the endearing Mottainai Grandma in the recently published Hindi-English bilingual edition of the book authored by Mariko Shinju. Others may recall the renowned Kenyan environmental activist and Nobel laureate Wangari Muta Maathai, who adopted mottainai as a shining motto for making the world a more environmentally friendly place.In Japan, children are taught to eat every last grain of rice in their bowl, because even a single grain is too precious to be wasted, given the energy and resources invested in producing it. This attitude is deeply rooted into the ancient Japanese belief of Shintoism, which says that God is everywhere in nature, including the trees, mountains, and rice fields. As such, Japanese people perceive nature to be sacred. This sense of reverence towards nature, I understand, is also shared by the Indian people, since the environment is deeply embedded into the scriptures of Hinduism and Buddhism.Cherishing the mottainai spirit, Japan has cultivated a culture that follows the 3Rs: reduce (garbage), reuse, and recycle. One practical example of the 3Rs is the segregation of garbage. In Japan, it is obligatory to sort garbage before throwing it away. All garbage must be segregated into combustible and non-combustible piles; recyclable items must also be separated. This has become a habit, and it is done naturally and autonomously by each family as a regular activity. Also of note, the highly technologically-advanced and clean waste incineration facilities in Japan are a striking sight: They can be found standing proudly in the middle of immaculately clean cities as they themselves contribute, albeit indirectly, to protecting the clear blue skies.Japanese people strive to live harmoniously with the environment, and Japan is actively assisting India in carrying forward its Swachh Bharat (Clean India) campaign. As a strong supporter of Swachh Bharat, I would like to convey three messages:First and most importantly, to raise awareness and mobilise the public, no tool works more efficiently and effectively than the education system and the network it wields. To reinforce our commitment towards the environment as a precious entity on which our survival depends, the youth must be encouraged to imbibe the mottainai spirit.In this regard, Japan proposed the concept of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) at the Earth Summit in 2002. ESD requires every student to consider the numerous challenges that are being faced today by the global community, like environmental pollution and climate change, as their own challenges, and to take the actions they think are necessary to solve them. Such actions need not be complicated: We can start here and now by cherishing every single grain of rice, segregating trash and recyclables, and more.Second, let me share our experiences with you. It is often forgotten that Japan also once suffered from severe environmental pollution. In the late 1950s and 1960s, Japan enjoyed a period of high economic growth, riding on the booming heavy and chemical industries sector. Excitement and anticipation filled the air. Unfortunately, we were unaware and blindsided by the consequences of pollution. It was unprecedented, so we had no references to draw on. The most devastating impact was the toll on human health. Smoke from factories polluted city air, and water became toxic after chemical plants released mercury into the river. People suffered. We needed to take decisive action, and everybody, including the government, companies, civil society groups, and individuals, had to play a role in the solution. It took much time and incurred many costs, but Japan eventually succeeded in reclaiming its blue sky and clean water.Environmental problems still exist in the world, but there are many previous examples that India can use as references. Japan will always stand beside India, eager to cooperate in finding solutions to avoid the same kind of suffering that we experienced.Third, a key solution is technology. During the period of heavy pollution in Japan, Japanese companies developed numerous state-of-the-art technologies to help reverse the situation. Even today, Japans drive for developing environmentally-friendly technologies remains as strong as ever. Technology for suppressing the production of dioxins released from garbage incineration is one such example. The harnessing of biomass energy from agricultural residues is another area in which Japanese companies are making enormous headway. Japan has also become a world leader when it comes to electric vehicles: It was the first country to start mass-producing the vehicles, and improved models are continually being released, for example, a new model from Nissan can run 400 km with just a single charge. Japan also has a long history of producing eco-friendly hybrid vehicles. With Toyota as a front-runner, hybrid vehicles readily serve towards achieving a cleaner society.Recently, the Embassy of Japan in India launched the Blue Sky Initiatives, which aim to mitigate air pollution by ensuring that the best and latest technologies will be made available to India. For instance, exhaust from coal thermal power plants is one of the primary causes of air pollution in India. Japanese companies have developed equipment that can filter out particulate matter. In the future, we expect even more advanced applications of Japanese technology to help improve the environment.Japan and India now enjoy an unprecedented level of mutual trust and friendship. With immense confidence in the ability and commitment of the Indian government and its people in combating environmental pollution, Japan is eager to deepen our cooperation in this field. By combining Indian resolve with the technological expertise of Japan, the two nations can win the fight against pollution and regain cleaner and greener environment.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b2cf60b9855b707a4cc85b3,Much ado about  an impractical idea,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/much-ado-about-an-impractical-idea-basic-minimum-wage-5106308/,2018-03-22,"Bhalla thinks UBI is a terrible idea because it messes up incentives. That may well be the case. I find it a terrible idea because I dont know what UBI means. Bhalla thinks UBI is a terrible idea because it messes up incentives. That may well be the case. I find it a terrible idea because I dont know what UBI means.Surjit Bhalla is a co-columnist in this paper and a colleague in the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister. Therefore, when he writes a new book, reading it is an inevitable professional hazard. His new book is titled The New Wealth of Nations. It is about education as the creator of this new wealth. In this book, in passing (since this doesnt have much to do directly with the books core proposition), Bhalla brings in Universal Basic Income (UBI) and the Speenhamland system. This took my mind back several decades, to my student days, when one read about poor laws in Britain. The justices of Berkshire, meeting at the Pelikan Inn, in Speenhamland, near Newbury, on May 6, 1795, in a time of great distress, decided that subsidies in aid of wages should be granted in accordance with a scale dependent upon the price of bread, so that a minimum income should be assured to the poor irrespective of their earnings, Surjit cites this quote from Karl Polyanis The great transformation. The original edition of this book was published in 1944. Where was Polyani in 1944? Bennington College, and later, Columbia University in the US. I find a lot of people quoting from Polyanis book. Pelikan Inn? Thats not how I remembered it from the works of Mark Blaug and Eric Hobsbawm. I remembered it as Pelican Inn.Indeed, it was Pelican Inn; references to it go back to 1646. There were two adjacent inns, George and Pelican. When travel by coaches was important, travelers from (and to) London often stopped at Newbury and frequented George and Pelican. Pelican seems to have been more like stables and entertainment (there was a Pelican Theatre), while George is where people stayed. I found this delightful poem about Pelican Inn. The famous inn at Speenhamland, That stands below the hill, May well be called the Pelican, From its enormous bill. By middle of the 19th century, George and Pelican shut down. As for the Speenhamland System, it was never as common as is often assumed. There was an attempt to legislate and make it universal through the Poor Law Bill of 1796, but that failed. Whatever remained was killed by the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. I tracked down the minutes of the meeting of Berkshire Justices at Speenhamland, Newbury, on May 6, 1795, and discovered something I hadnt been aware of. This was a General Meeting of the Justices of this County, together with several discreet persons assembled by public advertisement.The Magistrates very earnestly recommend to the Farmers and others throughout the county, to increase the pay of their Labourers in Proportion to the Present Price of Provisions. There was thus a scale of wage supplements, depending on number of children in the household and price of bread. I am not sure this should be called UBI, though thats how it is often presented. I hadnt known that the trigger for the Speenhamland meeting was an intervention by a court. At the General Quarter Sessions of the Peace for this County, held at Newbury on Tuesday the fourteenth instant (of April 1795), the Court having taken into consideration the great inequality of Labourers Wages, and the insufficiency of the same for necessary support of an industrial man and his family; and it being the opinion of the gentlemen assembled on the Grand Jury, that many parishes have not advanced their labourers weekly pay in proportion to the very high price of corn and provisions do. Hence, there was a court directive to hold that meeting. Bad ideas often emanate from the judiciary, not the executive. However, in fairness, the court directive only mentioned prices of corn and other provisions. It didnt mention number of children in the household.Bhalla thinks UBI is a terrible idea because it messes up incentives. That may well be the case. I find it a terrible idea because I dont know what UBI means. There is a certain amount of public expenditure which the government (in its different layers) makes. Surely, all that is not going to be converted into an equivalent UBI. Often that public expenditure is in the form of collective goods, such as roads or railways, or law and order and security. Surely, one is not going to tell a community: Here is your equivalent money, go and build your own road. Therefore, any concrete UBI presumably means public expenditure (such as through various subsidies) on individual/household goods. In that event, why introduce new acronyms unnecessarily? Why not simply call it DBT (direct benefit transfers)? Perhaps one means universal social security (life insurance, medical insurance, pensions). Again, it would be simpler to call it just that, instead of UBI. Unless there is precision, UBI sounds suspiciously like what the Chinese used to call iron rice bowl. This meant a guaranteed standard of living, irrespective of the workers efforts (There is a story behind the expression iron bowl). It didnt work and was progressively abandoned. Karl Marxs idea in Critique of the Gotha Programme, From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs, hasnt worked as well. But Marx also acknowledged this could only happen in a higher phase of Communist society, not immediately. Outside of China, I dont think any socialist country has attempted to implement it, not even partially. The former Soviet Union always said it was in a lower stage of Communism.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b2cf8639855b707a4cc85bb,"New Farmer, Old Paradigm",https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/new-farmer-old-paradigm-agriculture-sector-development/,2018-03-22,"Farmer in Western Maharashtra makes his sowing decision knowing that the price he will get will be lower than the price he sees. Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty 15-03-18, Mumbai Farmer in Western Maharashtra makes his sowing decision knowing that the price he will get will be lower than the price he sees. Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty 15-03-18, MumbaiAgriculture in western India is different from that in the Gangetic Plain. Wheat is much less important than rice, bajra and jowar. Cotton is grown in Maharashtra. The farmer has been taking on biotech seeds, moving over from the earlier desi varieties to long-staple cotton and now seeds which give a good crop with shorter growing periods, saving on pesticides and nutrients. A larger area is being devoted to pulses and oilseeds. Suresh Prabhu, coming from Nashik, knows all this and also about fruits and vegetables (grapes and onions). At Buenos Aires in the WTO Ministerial last December, he stood by the time-honoured Indian line: Agriculture and food security first. So, I was surprised when at a Delhi brainstorming session at the end of February he said that other issues are also of relevance.The typical middle farmer in Western Maharashtra and Vidarbha makes his sowing decision knowing that the price he will get will be lower than the price he sees. When I went to my co-operative (co-op), where I originally met Minister Prabhu before he became a minister, the pulse price was around Rs 190/kilo. The kisan knows this will go down. But by how much? It went down to almost the MSP levels. Thats ridiculous.The towns and traders were happy. Imports were high. Australia, Canada and East Africa, not to mention the US, grow pulses to export to India. In fact, the Canadians cleverly claim green box subsidy exemption under WTO rules for pulses on the ground that they fix nitrogen in otherwise monoculture, wheat-growing Prairies. I have been advocating tariffs against these subsidies largely by commodity boards abroad. Finally, the Government Of India imposed tariffs, but it came too little and too late.The farmer does not want the price he saw at the sowing time, but the MSP is a joke. So, they said MSP plus 50 per cent. A nice round number. But even if this is declared, who will buy? Wheat and rice have the Food Corporation of India (FCI). But pulses, oilseed and inferior cereals have so-called procurement agencies, which are broke and do only ceremonial purchases. Fruits and vegetables dont even have those. The co-ops stick to cane and, of course, milk. Maharashtras cotton experience never recovered from the monopoly purchase fiasco as compared to GUJCOT in Gujarat where my socialist friend, the late Sanat Mehta, was more market-friendly. The tragic response in Delhi to farmers suicides was to give loans for buying goats.The last time I was travelling on the national highway from Nashik to Mumbai, in the fancy eateries on the road, farmers coming in on bikes with traditional clothes and Gandhi caps would order a bottle of red wine and cheese or chole bhaturey or Marathi chicken with that lovely kokum flavour. You can see this on the road from Pune or Ahmednagar to Rahuri. Some may want the sparkling wine with tandoori chicken. But not all the grapes have the wine market. Policy has to come to grips with the new realities. If you visit a farmer, he may tell you that a new buffalo has been purchased because the bai has some spare time.But the price of milk can vary by 10 per cent in markets around the farm. The milk co-ops are not that efficient. Some farmer-producer companies are coming up but shifting them from the Company Affairs Department to the good old Agriculture Department will bureaucratise their governance, given the history of the latter. An increasingly complex agriculture is crying for new paradigms.So, the kisan is on the road. It breaks your heart. Almost like the rebellions Spartacus led against the Roman empire. Can we at least protect the costs of say, the top two-thirds of farmers ranked by productivity? Will we meet their capital and land costs? Will they get help for infrastructure for first-stage processing and transport in Census towns, which mai bap sarkar still calls villages? These abound in western India. When we do and have the right macro-economic and trade policies, the kisan will get back to his land and tubewell  a deep one here. Until then, the saints go marching in.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5b2d49539855b723c6f45772,The Karnataka model,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-karnataka-model-5090001/,2018-03-08,"Beyond reservations, Siddaramaiah has implemented a slew of welfare measures in Karnataka (in picture: chief minister Siddaramaiah) Beyond reservations, Siddaramaiah has implemented a slew of welfare measures in Karnataka (in picture: chief minister Siddaramaiah)In a recent speech at the Mahatma Gandhi Stadium, Bangalore, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah presented Karnataka as a better model state than Gujarat because of its capacity to attract investments (Rs 1.50 lakh crore per annum against Rs 40,000 crore). He also used todays standard metrics of development by saying that Karnatakas growth rate was above the national average (8.5 per cent against 7.1 per cent).But there are other criteria of human development: Karnataka has contained social inequalities on at least one count, the closing gap between the OBCs, SCs and Muslims on one hand, and the dominant castes on the other hand  and in this domain it has been more effective than many states, including Gujarat.According to the Indian Human Development Survey, in 2011-12, the annual per capita mean income of the OBCs represented 89 per cent of that of the dominant castes  Lingayats and Vokkaligas  in Karnataka. In Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra, it represented only 49, 50 and 78 per cent.Interestingly, the relative affluence of the Karnataka OBCs  in 2011-12 they earned more than the Gujarat OBCs, Rs 26,264 as annual per capita mean income, against Rs 25,488 for the Gujarat OBCs  was not due to job reservation. Only 12 per cent of the Karnataka OBCs got salaried jobs, against 15 per cent for the Gujarat OBCs. Karnataka OBCs benefited more from another dimension of the positive discrimination programmes: Quotas in education.Indeed, the percentage of graduates among the Karnataka OBCs is slightly above that of the dominant castes, 4.8 per cent against 4.6 per cent. Gujarat OBCs lag behind, with only 2.1 per cent of the state OBCs reaching the graduation level, almost five times less than the dominant castes.In spite of atrocities, Dalits lag less behind dominant castes in Karnataka than in Gujarat in socio-economic terms. While they got 68 per cent of the annual per capita income of the dominant castes in Karnataka, they received only 54 per cent of it in Gujarat in 2011-12 (against 57 per cent in 2004-05).Muslims also do well in Karnataka as compared to some other states. In 2011-12, the annual per capita mean income of the Muslims was 74 per cent of that of the Hindus in Karnataka while it was 31 per cent in Haryana, 62 per cent in Gujarat and 73 per cent in Maharashtra. The average Muslims earned Rs 20,473 in Karnataka while they earned only Rs 18,864 in Gujarat. That was partly due to the fact that a section of backward Muslims has been included in the reservation list. The percentage of graduates among Muslims was 2.8 per cent in Karnataka, while it was just 1.6 per cent in Gujarat in 2011-12. Today, Karnataka is also offering a range of scholarships to all the minority communities, which benefitted over 14 lakh students.These contrasts between Karnataka and Gujarat reflect diverging public policies and political trajectories. In the late 1970s-early 1980s, Gujarat and Karnataka were among the pioneering states in terms of reservations. But Madhavsinh Solanki had to give up his policy in 1985 due to Patel-led demonstrations and no government revisited them, whereas Karnataka, with ups and downs, made the legacy it had inherited from Devraj Urs fructify.While the Gujarat Congress let the KHAM coalition desintegrate, the Karnataka Congress rebuilt what is today known as AHINDA, a Kannada acronym for Minorities, Backwards and Dalits. Siddaramaiah, who is himself an OBC from the Kuruba (shepherd) caste, has committed to increase, if reelected, reservations beyond the 50 per cent cap the judiciary has imposed in every state except Tamil Nadu.The court would prevent that, but this promise may strike a chord even beyond the Backwards and Dalits. Indeed, the creative manner in which Karnataka has dealt with reservations has resulted in the inclusion of segments of the dominant castes, mainly Vokkaligas, among the OBCs: Vokkaligas who have studied in a school in a rural area are eligible for the OBC quota.Here again, Karnataka could offer a model to Gujarat, Maharashtra and Haryana, three states where dominant castes are asking for reservations because of the critical situation of their rural segments. While some Vokkaligas benefit from reservations, Lingayats are following another route by asking for recognition as a religious minority.Beyond reservations, Siddaramaiah has implemented a slew of welfare measures. On August 16, 2017, Indira Canteens were launched to serve subsidised food to the lower sections in towns and cities, a scheme akin to Amma Canteens in Tamil Nadu. The canteens provide breakfast, lunch and dinner at subsidised rates and attract daily wage labourers, drivers, security guards, and others.In 2017, the state introduced the Ksheera Bhagya scheme, which offers milk to 37.52 lakh children aged from 6 months to 6 years, 5 days a week. Eggs are distributed twice a week to 14.85 lakh children aged between 3 and 6 years in anganwadis. This scheme, besides improving child nutrition, has helped reduce the school dropout rate. The Mathru Poorna scheme, also introduced in 2017, offers nutritious hot cooked meals to pregnant women and lactating mothers.In 2017, too, the Anna Bhagya scheme provided free rice through the Public Distribution System to people below the poverty line, a relief to the rural poor as the state was reeling under severe drought. In June 2017 President Pranab Mukherjee signed the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill, 2016, which provides reservations for SC/ST contractors in government contracts up to Rs 50 lakh.Whether the social dimension of the Congress programme will be sufficient to win the coming elections remains to be seen. Certainly, the party has sent positive signals to the relegated Dalit jatis by promising them sub-quotas within the SC category, but the new alliance formed by the JD(S) and BSP may well make inroads among the Congress Dalit vote bank.The states tradition of shifting from one party to the other in each election may help the BJP, especially if the latter succeeds in communalising the campaign and taking the state by storm with Narendra Modi as the chief campaigner.Whatever the results of the elections, Karnataka stands as an alternative model based not only on growth, but also on the closing of social and religious gaps, in contrast to the socio-economic, caste and communal polarisations which prevail in western and northern India. But Karnataka may exemplify here what is true of the South at large.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The I-T department has also attached four immovable properties of Rotomac group in Kanpur and Ahmedabad.The ED also scrutinised papers of some of the shell companies associated with Modi and those of Mehul Choksi of Gitanjali Gems.Choksi is a co-accused in the Punjab National Banks Rs 11,400 crore swindle along with Modi and was partner in three firms linked to the caseDiamond R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds. The other accused in the case are Modis wife Ami and brother Nishal.On Wednesday, ED teams raided four locations at Opera House, Peddar Road, Goregaon (East) and Powai in Mumbai besides searches in other cities. So far ED has seized diamonds and gold jewellery from Nirav Modi stores worth over Rs 5,700 crore.The income tax department had conducted searches on 13 companies of the Mehul Choksis Gitanjali group on Tuesday at 20 locations in five cities. The searches included some of the shell companies associated with Choksi.Many of the shell companies searched had huge financial transactions with Choksis Gitanjali Gems Ltd and Gili India Ltd though they had insignificant businesses. The I-T department has attached 29 high-value properties of Modi and eight of Choksi and attached their bank accounts too.In another case, the ED on Wednesday provisionally attached assets worth Rs 100 crore of REI Agro Ltd in connection with another bank fraud case worth about Rs 3,800. The second case relates to diversion of funds sanctioned by a consortium of banks by the accused to many of his shell companies. The case dates back to 2015 when the CBI had first registered an FIR against REI Agro.The ED probe revealed that REI Agro Ltd and its directors, Sandip Jhunjhunwala and others, had diverted the funds sanctioned as working capital loan by 14 banks under consortium led by the UCO Bank. The accused adopted different modus operandi, including trading in bogus bills and investing the money in shell companies, a senior officer said.Jhunjhunwala is accused of arranging false purchase and sales invoices of rice and paddy through brokers in Delhi for availing maximum working capital limits from the consortium of banks and later diverted the funds for capital expenditure."

(Express Photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi) Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley holds the bag containing the papers for the Union Budget as he comes to present the Budget at the Parliament. (Express Photo by Neeraj Priyadarshi)Budget 2019 can best be described as one made possible by an ongoing revolution in tax collection. This revolution is beginning to make possible another revolution in income transfers to the bottom third of the population. The tax revenue and possibilities for change were documented in an earlier article that I wrote with Arvind Virmani (Smart policies for redistribution, IE, January 29). The budget contains a highly-laudable introduction of health insurance to the bottom 40 per cent. We do not know its cost as yet, but we can surmise that eventually it is likely to cost somewhere around Rs 20,000 crore a year.Another part of redistribution is the increase in minimum support prices for farmers to 1.5 times the cost of production (the cost as estimated by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices). One estimate of the cost of this increase is the Rs 29,000-crore increase in the food subsidy budget for 2018-19  the government buys from farmers at a higher price but still sells wheat and rice in the ration shops at Rs 2 per kg and Rs 3 per kg,respectively.This transfer from the Centre, largely to farmers, is certain. In addition, states like Madhya Pradesh and Telangana are transferring incomes to the farmer. As Sunil Jain has pointed out in The Financial Express, the MP scheme has a major moral hazard problem  farmers, or traders, can dump supply in the market, lower the price, receive a subsidy from the government (difference between market price and MSP), and then (possibly) sell at a higher market price. In contrast, Telangana has announced a direct benefit transfer policy for farmers (somewhat along the lines I argued alongwith Virmani). Each farmer is likely to get Rs 8,000 a year for each acre of cultivation.What is happening? We all thought that the states were in big debt, that they were constrained from having a fiscal deficit (FD) no more than 3 per cent of GDP, but they are spending freely, and providing income to the poor. And the central government is doing the same  a transfer to poor farmers, and transfer to the poorest 100 million families in the form of healthcare.India is undergoing a fiscal revolution  in direct taxes (thanks to demonetisation) and indirect taxes (thanks to GST). In the pre-budget article, Virmani and I had clearly stated that This tax buoyancy opens doors for a reformist fiscal policy  doors that can lead to greater tax collection, lower tax rates, and greater, and more efficient, tax redistribution. Doors that can lead to a golden era of fiscal policy. We expect that a blueprint will be laid out for such reforms in the Budget to be presented on February 1.However, when Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented the FD numbers for 2017/18, expert economists and analysts found that they had reason to complain about fiscal profligacy. The FD estimate for 2017/18 was reported as 3.5 per cent of GDP, handily slipping the original target of 3.2 per cent. It is noteworthy that the consensus of FD estimates emerging from the foreign and domestic banks was very close to 3.5 per cent of GDP. The natural inclination, therefore, was for experts to give each other high-fives and say how right they were in forecasting the populism of the Modi government.But this urge to be right (reputations depend on being right) has prevented analysts from paying any heed to the warnings issued by CEA Arvind Subramanian and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Jaitley said this in the budget speech itself: In 2017-18, Central government will be receiving GST revenues only for 11 months, instead of 12 months. This will have a fiscal effect (emphasis added). In the Economic Survey (ES), the CEA said: The GST was unveiled after comprehensive preparations, calculations and multi-stage consultations, yet the sheer magnitude of change meant that it needed to be carefully managed. The government is navigating the change and challenges, including the possibility that a substantial portion of the last-month GST collections may spill over to the next year. Also in the ES: Considering that more than half of the direct tax collections are normally realised during the last four months of the financial year, the budget targets for the current year are still not out of sight.The 3.5 per cent FD estimate meant that, given expenditures, total revenues had slipped by about Rs 65,000 crore. Normally, indirect tax revenue collections in March are twice that of an average month (this has held true for the last 15 years). End of the year filing pressures make this happen. With GST smoothing, it is very unlikely that March 2018 GST revenue (the one not included in the revenue statement of the FY 2017/18 budget) will be twice that of the February 2018 GST revenue.Assume March GST revenue to be close to the run-rate observed to date  around Rs 90,000 crore (actually it is a bit more, around Rs 95,000 crore but who is counting). The Centre will receive Rs 26,000 crore, and the excess fiscal deficit is almost cut in half. Now assume that the GST March 2018 revenue is Rs 1,30,000 crore  the Centre receives Rs 38,000 crore, and the FD for 2017/18 is close to 3.3 per cent of GDP.Given high tax revenues, and sensible redistribution to the poor (all those opposed, please speak up) what was the regression in the budget? Tragically, and ironically, it was an additional tax revenue that is the dream of traditional revenue collectors. It was the introduction of a 10 per cent tax on long-term capital gains.I have to indulge in a bit of disclosure here. Back in 2003, I prepared a note for the Kelkar Committee on direct taxes, a committee that included Arbind Modi, the person in charge of drafting a blueprint for direct taxes by the Narendra Modi government. As it turned out, the recommendation of this committee  elimination of long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax, a 10 per cent short term gain tax (later increased to 15 per cent ), and the introduction of a securities transaction tax  was introduced by then Finance Minister P Chidambaram in the 2004/5 Budget.The Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has yielded a steady revenue of around Rs 8,000 crore a year, and is estimated to yield Rs 11,000 crore next fiscal year. The argument for the introduction of STT in 2003 was that the certainty of tax revenue regardless of market conditions was to be preferred over fluctuating revenues (that is, a bird in hand should be preferred to one in the bush). STT is obtained on transactions  as long as transactions are there, STT revenue is obtained. If revenue concerns were paramount (they manifestly were not, as documented above), the government could have increased the STT by 50 per cent, that is, a certain revenue of around Rs 16,000 crore from STT rather than anticipated (and uncertain) tax revenue of Rs 20,000 crore a year from LTCG  or close to zero if the stock market average for the year would fall.It is useful to note the capital gains collections for FY 2014/15, as released by MoF just a few weeks ago. In that fiscal year, the stock market went up 32 per cent and the and the short-term capital gains declared was 73.3 thousand crore. At a 15 per cent tax rate, STCG yielded Rs 11,000 crore  not much more than the STT tax collection of Rs 7,400 crore.A big data unknown is the mix of sales of equities on a short-term and a long-term basis in 2014/15. If that mix was 50-50 in 2014/15, then we know that LTCG, with a 32 per cent gain in the market, and a 10 per cent tax rate, would have yielded Rs 7,300 crore. Note that this is virtually identical to the revenue gain from a 50 per cent increase in the STT. And it is uncertain  hence, a safe conclusion is that the LTCG tax was ill-advised, and purely so on revenue considerations.The Modi government needs to be congratulated for helping transform the fiscal landscape, and making tax revenue a non-problem. The government can now think up efficient ways of transferring this income to the poor. This is happening  so why the introduction of yet another tax, something even the RBI governor has rightly complained about?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Officials said in many cases the fingerprints were getting erased or not matching on biometric equipment, wherein card holders were found to be daily labourers.Though field level officers were authorised to identify such cases and approve release of PDS rice, but some field officers misused the authority. As a result, PDS rice meant for the beneficiary was being diverted to open market. Complaints started to pour in with senior officials, following which Civil Supplies Commissioner CV Anand decided to instal IRIS.Officials also plan to introduce voice over system that would help the rural folk and particularly illiterate people , as the equipment would recognise their voice.

But what is disappointing is to see the Narendra Modi government coming out with a budget that significantly deviates from its earlier deficit targets.This is a government that, after all, can be credited with not compromising on fiscal prudence, unlike the previous UPA regime. That track record has, however, now been somewhat dented, with the Centres fiscal deficit for 2017-18 estimated at 3.5 per cent of GDP, against the originally budgeted 3.2 per cent. For the coming fiscal, the budget estimate of 3.2 per cent is the same as last years and above the 3 per cent level as per the original glide path. Such fiscal slippages would have been tolerable even a year ago, when global interest rates and oil prices were low.But in todays scenario, with international crude prices at about $70 a barrel and central banks withdrawing the monetary stimulus measures put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, not sticking to borrowing targets can prove dangerous. This was seen on Thursday, with yields on the 10-year government bonds soaring from 7.43 per cent to 7.61 per cent  a significant jump in a single day. It would be interesting to see the response of the RBI at the next meeting of its monetary policy committee on February 7. Clearly, the impact of breaching deficit targets  and the implications on interest rates across the economy  has been underestimated.The same lack of recognition of global realities is visible in not cutting the corporate tax rate  from 30 per cent to 25 per cent, as was promised in the 2015-16 Budget. High rates are counter-productive when other countries  notably the Trump administration in the US  have gone in for deep tax cuts to make it attractive to do business in their domestic jurisdictions.The same goes with imposing long term capital gains on stocks and equity mutual fund units. This would have been fine, had it been accompanied by doing away with the current 20 per cent tax on distribution of dividends by companies along with making dividend incomes solely taxable at the hands of the investor. One way to interpret this is that investors in stock markets have made hay during the last couple of years and it is only fair to tax a part of their profits. Similarly, large corporates, it can be argued, can afford to pay a higher tax rate.But this is a narrow and mechanical view. Corporates, ultimately, are drivers of economic activity, while markets are a barometer of business sentiment. For a country that has been starved of investments in the last few years, the current measures would simply be counterproductive. Yes, capital gains should be taxed, but whether this was the time to rock markets needs to be asked.HAVING said that, the budget offers several positives as well. The proposal to have a flagship scheme providing over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families with an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation is certainly welcome. The fiscal cost of subsidising the premiums on this scheme  without which no insurer would be willing to take it up  is not known. But it is something that is worth funding. The Centre should get the states on board to meet a part of the premium burden and, of course, to ensure its delivery to the targeted beneficiaries. The sheer numbers involved should make it possible to bring down the overall cost of the scheme, which is touted as the worlds largest government-funded healthcare programme.There is a similar lack of clarity on how the Modi government plans to give 50 per cent return over production costs to farmers while fixing minimum support prices (MSP)  and how it will ensure that they get this benefit. Ideally, this should be done through a mechanism wherein the difference between the MSP and market prices is directly credited to the bank accounts of farmers.The Madhya Pradesh government is already implementing a Bhavantar price deficiency scheme, which can be replicated nationally with 50:50 Central:state funding. Such a scheme should replace the existing physical procurement programme that is both fiscally more costly and also benefits only rice and wheat-growing farmers of select states. It is good that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has left the design of a mechanism for implementing a price deficiency scheme for farmers to the Niti Aayog. It is good, also, that the government has thought it fit to push the large corporates, to start with, to go to the bond market for a part of their financing needs.That should have a knock-on impact on banks whose balance sheets should be freed up to lend more to SMEs and smaller firms and to retail borrowers. It will also send a signal to corporate India on lenders having a greater say unlike in the past  which led to banks being burdened with a pile of bad loans.The Economic Survey referred to the need for creative incrementalism to push growth rather than big bang reforms. Going by what was on offer on Thursday, there doesnt seem to be much creativity on offer.The overwhelming feeling is of an opportunity missed again  at a crucial time when there is synchronised global growth and many of the so-called fragile economies the FM referred to are also slowly bouncing back. Too often, governments have taken growth as a given. This government should not end up making the same mistake.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Dubyna likes to travel solo , explore new places and meet different people. Her wanderlust brought her to the city of Destiny on Tuesday.With the motto, Discover, Learn, Smile, Dubyna has visited more than 40 countries, including the United States of America, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, Italy, Argentina, Peru and Cambodia.This is her seventh visit to India and her first visit to Andhra Pradesh.The young explorer said, Since childhood, travelling and exploring new places have been my dream. I was only six when I promised myself that I would create my own route map to go around the world. However, as I grew up, my first goal was to be successful at my job and then use the money to travel and gain experience.Stating that travelling allows one to explore both external as well as our internal world, Dubyna said that as a woman solo rider, health and safety are the two major criteria. As a safety measure, I make sure to stay connected with my family, irrespective of where I am in the world. I do not venture out during late hours and I also make sure that I am aware of the places that are out of bound. During difficult situations, yoga and meditation have helped me a lot, added the adventurer who has been travelling alone since 2008.Speaking to TOI about what she loves most about India, Dubyna said that westerners are materialistic unlike Indians who are happy with what they have. There is a lot to learn from Indians; their values, cultures and traditions. After visiting India, I have become somewhat addicted to turmeric and I use it in almost everything I make. I also purchased a pressure cooker to cook rice and a dosa pan (a griddle) as I love Indian cuisines.Dubyna also revealed that she enjoys interacting with young girls across the globe and motivate them to follow their dreams. She said that she has trained three girls in Poland to be able to embark on solo journies.The solo traveller plans to visit India again in September this year to participate in the marathon that is scheduled to be held in Ladakh."

Both have severe learning disabilities and are set to lose their only shot at primary education  their school.The villages primary education centre, which functions only up to Class IV, has figured in the list of institutes facing closure across the state. It has 12 students and the next nearest school is 4km away.A former student of this school had subsequently attended the neighbouring school and had gone on to score a record 95% in the Class X exams in 2016. Villagers say its unlikely there will ever be a repeat of this achievement.A disability of any type can leave one socially and economically stranded here. Parents of children with learning disabilities seldom send them to schools that are a distance away. They need these schools nearby. If we lose our only school, theres no hope for Karthik and Kunal, says a villager who is on crutches. The two teachers working at Mhakoshi say close proximity to a school will only help the two kids.They are, at least, getting an education until Class IV. And thats because the school is next to their homes. They are getting our undivided attention here, says Snehalata Vairagkar , one of the schools two teachers.When Vairagkar had joined the school 10 years ago, it had 28 students. But everyones gone now. Mhakoshi has a population of 350, but most of the younger families have moved to Pune or Mumbai. We grow rice here and the crop takes about four months  families move for the rest of the year, she says.Kavita Shedge, whose son attends the school, says she will not be able to send the child to the other school. Moreover, she says the children will not be able to immediately adapt to the new syllabus. Moving to Class V, without a minimum learning level, will make our children feel inferior. They will eventually lose interest and drop out. Is that what the government wants? she asks.Similar concerns are worrying the residents of Humbevasti village too. An hour away from Mhakoshi, this village  surrounded by hills  has a school with nine children and two teachers. Its unlikely to survive the summer.The older children, of mostly cattle-rearers and daily wage workers, say it takes them 30 minutes by foot to reach a school in neighbouring Bandalwadi.Humbevasti itself is atop a hill. If we lose our school, the younger children will not be able to walk 45 minutes and then climb uphill on the return journey, says one the students.One of the parents TOI spoke to described how the terrain changes during the rains. Sumar Humbe has children in Classes II, III and IV. The road gets flooded. Even the older children have trouble walking the route during heavy showers. Is the government really expecting us to send children aged six or seven through that kind of weather every day? They will have to walk 45 minutes, cross small ponds and carry large schoolbags. Primary education is not supposed to cause distress to children, he says."

He was 92. The founding chairman of Punjab State Farmers Commission, it was under Kalkats leadership as the director of agriculture, Punjab, and later as the agriculture commissioner of India, that the country witnessed Green Revolution and India became self-sufficient in food grain production. He was also the former vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (Ludhiana) from 1998-2001.Known for his contribution during the Green Revolution era which led to a boom in the production of wheat and rice in the country, with Punjab leading the chart, not many know that Kalkats plans for the farmers of the state went beyond that. Infact, he was the one who even ushered a soybean revolution and also introduced banana cultivation for Punjab.Speaking to The Indian Express, Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon, vice-chancellor PAU said, We know him for wheat and rice, but he always thought out of the box. He was not a normal wheat and rice scientist. He was way beyond that. He introduced soybean cultivation in Punjab, though it wasnt commercially successful. Then he took soybean varieties from Punjab to Madhya Pradesh where they were immensely successful commercially as well. Despite sitting on political posts, he was never diplomatic, but always spoke his heart for benefit of farmers even if it was politically incorrect. He was never afraid of failures. He experimented and tried to venture in something new even if it failed.Banana cultivation in Punjab was also Kalkats brainchild and one among his many efforts to help the farmers in Punjab earn better. Due to many reasons like climate and less awareness, bananas in Punjab could not succeed but his idea behind it was to make farmers earn better. Once we were in dire need of funds to send PAU scientists to the US for training, he helped us in getting them from the government, said Dr Manjit Singh Kang, former vice chancellor, PAU to The Indian Express.It was under Kalkat that the Punjab State Farmers Commission took shape and he became the first chairman of the body in 2005 during the Congress rule.Later, in 2007, when SAD-BJP government led by Parkash Singh Badal as chief minister was in power, he offered to resign, but Badal did not accept his resignation. Badal saab did not let him resign. He asked him to continue. He was even ready to resign in the second tenure of SAD-BJP regime, but again he wasnt allowed to do so. He was always a bridge between government and farmers, the one who did not hesitate in speaking against the government for their benefit, said a senior PAU official.In 2017, Kalkat resigned after Congress government led by Captain Amarinder Singh was sworn in. This time he wasnt keeping well and expressed that he wants to get relieved from the responsibility, he added.Born in Hoshiarpurs Sahora village, Kalkat undertook various assignments at the international level, working as senior agriculturist with the World Bank. Posted at Washington DC, he worked for countries like Nigeria and Ghana. He introduced shallow tubewells and handpumps for them to make irrigation and drinking water accessible. He also worked for World Bank in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Nepal.He did his schooling from Montgomery district (Sahiwal) now in Pakistan and graduation in agriculture from Punjab Agriculture College, Lyallpur, in 1947. After his Masters in Agriculture in 1956 from the Punjab University, Solan, he joined the Ohio State University, USA, in January 1957 and completed his Ph.D in Agricultural Zoology Entomology in 1958.Dr SS Johl, Padma Bhushan and renowned food economist told The Indian Express, Today, I have lost a very good friend and adviser in my life. He was one such person who lived his life for betterment of farmers. It was his forte to put across his point politely even if it was against the government. He was not allowed to resign as Punjab Farmers Commission chairman by former CM Badal even as he offered to do so.It was under his chairmanship that the commission got studies conducted on serious issues such as rural suicides, flow of credit and indebtedness of farmers; rural education and fall in water table in central Punjab.The National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS) chairman his communication to Kalkat in 2015, during Golden Jubilee celebrations of Green Revolution stated, The deliberations recalled your contributions that turned the country from food shortage to self-sufficiency. I would like to once again thank you for the leadership provided by you during the Green Revolution in the country and guidance over the years.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

The topics for discussion were realising the returns of Rs 1 lakh per acre, factors behind price slash post-harvest, pricing agricultural produce, keeping middlemen at bay and benefits of delayed marketing of agricultural produce. Manuneedhi Trust and Nallamuthu Farming Research Centre in Tirunelveli jointly organised the meeting where 80 farmers from Madurai, Theni, Pudukottai, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar participated. Manuneedhi Manickam, president of the trust presided over the meeting. The focus of the meeting was returning to organic farming cultivating native varieties and finding right price for the produce, said A N M Thiruppathi, a progressive farmer from Kulamangalam in Madurai district. For instance, the rice variety, Mappilai Samba can fetch Rs 80 per kg when cultivated using organic farming. Similarly there are examples for each crop where the returns could be remunerative to farming community. Even after raising the crop amidst so much of difficulties, we still dont get the price we deserve for our produce, Thiruppathi mentioned.Among the speakers were, Pandi Umashankar from Sholavandhan, R Murugesan from Ramanathapuram, K P Subramani from Dindigul and K Radhakrishnan from Coimbatore who have been successfully using organic farming and reaping the benefits of it. Addressing the farmers, they elaborated about organic farming and their success stories.After over three hours of meeting, the farmers decided to conduct frequent gatherings of this sort in neighbouring districts coordinating progressive farmers, and sensitise them about the benefits of organic farming and rediscovering farming methods of past which were remunerative to farmers."

The Union territory administration has claimed the beneficiaries are not using the subsidy amount to buy foodgrain.The chief minister recently put up this proposal before Union minister Ram Vilas paswan. The UT administration says people are misutilising the subsidy from central government. We cant go back on the decision unless we are satisfied with the reason cited by the UT, said a food ministry official. The official added that even as the Centre rolled out direct benefit transfer ( DBT ) for food subsidy, the UT administration continued its scheme of providing 10kg singleboiled rice free per month to each family from the PDS . When they get free rice, why will they buy grain with the subsidy amount? asked the official.The Centre had rolled out DBT for subsidised foodgrain in Puducherry, Chandigarh and Daman and Diu in 2015. A study carried out to assess the impact later that year had shown that 70% of the beneficiaries in Chandigarh and 88% in Puducherry felt the amount credited to their accounts was not enough to buy 5kg of foodgrain per family member, their entitlement under the food security scheme.TOIhad first reported the findings on February 2016. Food ministry officials had said there were such complaints because once people got cash, they preferred to buy the foodgrain of their choice whereas earlier they had no option. To fix thismisutilisation, the food ministry had started a pilot to emulate the direct cooking gas subsidy transfer model for foodgrain PDS in Ranchi last year.Under this scheme, the beneficiaries get the subsidy amount in their bank accounts and they have to buy the foodgrain from any shop with point-of-sale devices. An assessment of this initiative was carried out recently. We are yet to get the report, but there are indications of a mixed response of beneficiaries, said a food ministry official."

Attributing the shortfall to ""faulty procurement policies"", Nishank said that ""urgent action was need to improve the situation in the state for which deliberations will be held with all stakeholders shortly."" The drastic fall of over 10 lakh metric ton is a cause of great concern. We will be holding regular meetings with the state government to ensure that paddy procurement increases in Uttarakhand and the state becomes self-reliant in this regard again,"" said Nishank.The immediate implication of the shortfall, according to experts, is that the rice supply in ration shops could be hit besides an additional burden being imposed on the state on account of having to procure rice from other states like Haryana and Punjab at a higher cost.the monthly demand of 22000 metric ton (rice and wheat) and for Kumaon 14,000 metric ton (rice and wheat). Nishank instructed the FCI officials to hold regular meetings to coordinate with the state government to identify the lapses in the procurement. """

On Tuesday, he set up shop amidst charred debris, twisted iron bars, crumpled galvanaised sheets and rotting vegetables, delivering fish for a marriage order he had accepted in advance.For others, it will take at least a fortnight to be back in business. That is the deadline set by municipality authorities to clear the debris. The traders may have to resume business under the open sky. But what they desperately need is a space that is clear so that they can begin selling, said Harinder Singh, chairman of the Dum Dum Municipality, after a meeting with the representatives of the market.Singh said CM Mamata Banerjee had expressed her keenness to rebuild the market at the earliest. But he recognised that would take at least a year, too long for the traders to wait. Most of them are counting their losses in the tragedy that also claimed two lives.Like Naskar, many others had orders from customers till Sunday and had stocked raw material accordingly. But the fire turned everything into ashes and has left them in ruin. We had Rs 1.5 lakh in the cashbox. The lender had to be paid on Monday. We dont have the cash to pay the debt now. This is what we are left with now, said Soma Roychowdhury, pointing at piles of black coal dusts. She used to have a puffed and flattened rice shop that was razed in the blaze.State PWD minister Firhad Hakim and fire minister Sovan Chatterjee visited the market on Tuesday and assured help of engineers and fire safety officials to rebuild the structure in a safer way.While the municipal body is looking for ways to mobilise funds for the reconstruction, traders are wary. Last time, it had cost them around Rs 30 lakh. Costs have doubled since then. Hopefully the state government will grant money this time, said Biswajit Das, leader of the RSP supported union that runs the market committee."

Shetye was allegedly beaten to death by the jail staff. Six members of the jail staff were arrested in connection with Shetyes death.The committee was set up after a team headed by Chavan visited the Byculla jail and revealed its horrifying living conditions in a report toManeka Gandhi. The report said that not only were the inmates not allowed to meet their family members, in most cases they had no idea about the charges against them or the stage at which their trial was.The report also said the women were provided only six sanitary napkins and if a seventh pad was found in the ration bag, they would get beaten up. There are ants in the oil, stones in the rice and insects in their dal and if they complained about this they were beaten up or reprimanded. They are also asked to pay in turns to have the toilets cleaned, the report said.In response to the report, the minister asked Chavan to constitute a larger group of experts, expand the scope of its study to womens jails across the country, and come up with recommendations to overhaul the existing system of governance based largely on intimidation and extortion.The committee  comprising of experts from law colleges and NGOs  has recommended that the new manual must clearly define the jail superintendents duty, make video links between jails and courts mandatory, and improve recreational facilities.The committee has also recommended that provisions for enabling more jails to be run by only female staff should be made and that prison staff should be made accountable for grievance redressal within a specified time.The committees other recommendations are:** Separate mother-and-baby unit in every womens jail.** Express mention for the minimum time allowed to a prisoner to spend outside the cell.** Difference in the rights for serious and non-serious offenders** Voting rights to non-serious offenders.** Adequate CCTV camera coverage.Talking to Mumbai Mirroron Friday, Chavan said the Shetye case was an eye-opener.I have submitted the report to the minister with the committees recommendations.

Since there werent too many people near the stage, I could see her clearly and felt extremely awkward. Post the performance, she walked up to me and told me that she loved my performance.

Taxi unions, he said would not intervene or be responsible if any operator was arrested on the charge of misconduct.Please disburse peaceful, and we will meet tomorrow morning, Korgaonkar said.On the insistence of certain committee members, Lobo addressed the crowd and told them that their issues would be resolved.On Friday, a last-minute decision by yellow and black taxis to participate in strike had caught authorities caught off-guard. Sources, however, said the yellow and black taxis would not be part of the strike for another day.The strike affected tourists to some extent even as coaches were arranged by the government for transportation of guests to and from the Dabolim airport and railway stations. This service will continue on Saturday too, the government said.The effect of the strike was not felt at the Mormugao port as no passenger cruise vessel was scheduled to berth on Friday. A cruise vessel is scheduled to reach Mormugao on Saturday."

For many decades, Punjabs contribution to Indias production of wheat and rice has been substantial. Time demands that we should also focus on other sectors that can give jobs to our people, Amarinder said.Amarinder said of the states almost 3 crore population, nearly 90 lakh was either jobless or underpaid. He identified it as a major reason for drug addiction in the state. Frustration creeps in the youngsters when they fail to find work, and this is when they take a wrong path. Its our duty to bring those who went astray back into the mainstream by giving them quality education and jobs, the CM said.With Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal also producing high-quantity rice and wheat, Punjab has to look elsewhere, says Amarinder. For creating more jobs, he is looking at bringing more IT companies into Mohali and making the city a hub of information technology. He underlined the need for improving the standard of education in government schools for preparing young people for the job market.He said: Mohali will be a catalyst in tapping the potential of the states youth. I want to see it grow as a major technological hub in north, he said. The city is being equipped with all the necessary facilities. Amarinder said that in the next five years, his government would keep the development of Mohali a continued process towards technological growth."

But the greenery and rich soil are not in Kerala, or India for that matter, but in the city of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates! For the 67 children from Kerala, Goa, North India and the Middle East, it was a novel experience as even the sight of a paddy field amidst the sands of Sharjah was new to them, while their parents rejoiced on seeing them doing something productive..The children planted the saplings in the 27 cents of land situated next to the rented home of agriculturalist Sudheesh Guruvayoor , and followed his directions. I am overwhelmed seeing the enthusiasm of the kids. I gave them two weeks training, both theory and practice. We let them play on the field and asked the parents not to worry about them getting muddy. They are getting to know nature, he says.Sudheesh, who promotes organic farming in UAE, came up with the idea after watching a programme about differently abled kids on television. As part of enlightening the next generation on the need for agriculture, I had taken students of three schools to the open space beside my house to plant rice saplings, four months back. It was really fruitful and we got five paras (around 40 kg) of paddy. We have processed it at home, he says.It wasnt an easy process making the dry soil of Sharjah fertile, Sudheesh reveals. It was a long and strenuous process. I tilled the land, watered it for months, added dry cow dung and dry goat pellets and did vermicomposting, making the soil suitable for cultivation. Once the land became fertile, things were easy, Sudheesh explains.This time, he decided to take differently abled children to his farm. When I spoke to Dr P Mary Anitha who works closely with the specially abled kids, she said that working in the fields can help them undergo therapies such as mud therapy, greenery therapy, water therapy and physiotherapy. I decided to go ahead, he says. The plantation festival began on the morning of January 13, at 10 am, and went on till 1 pm, followed by a few cultural programmes. The harvesting will be done during the time of Vishu. There were singers, dancers besides kids with other talents. I learnt a new lesson by joining them to plant saplings. Nothing is impossible for them, and they dont our sympathy. They should be treated like everybody else, he says.Sudheesh, an electrical engineer from Guruvayoor, was working at the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority before he quit his job in 2002, after falling in love with farming."

From milk products to fish, sweets and cakes, imported or packaged foods items are being ignored in favour of their indigenous varieties.For instance, items from dairy giants which generally rule the market have taken a back seat as the demand for home-made products has gone up. ""I have already sold more than 20 litres of curd so far and I also have an advance order for around 120 litres. We are doing good business here and this is the best time of the year for us,"" said Xun Barman who hails from Sarbhog in Barpeta district, and was selling dairy items at a makeshift stall near Dighalipukhuri in the city. He also pointed out that one litre of buffalo curd costs around Rs 180 during this time.With a high demand for locally prepared curd in the market, branded dairy items like packaged yogurt were for once being ignored. In Upper Assam , villagers from places like Janjhi which are known for their traditional milk products, are working round the clock to meet the sudden surge in demand.""These traditional forms of curd are creamy in texture, have more fat content and often melt in the mouth. Unlike other forms of curd, it is sour and clear white in colour. Prepared from raw buffalo milk, traditional yogurt is a favourite dish in every Assamese household during the festival of Magh Bihu,"" said a trader at Jhanji Mukh in Jorhat.Jalpan, a local form of curd with flattened rice and molasses, is another traditional favourite during this festival. The demand for local types of fish has also gone up with Bhokuwa or Rahu, ferried from Andhra Pradesh and other states, being neglected during this time."

Even the less fancy restaurants tried hard to make the ambience as posh as possible; the more western, the better was the mantra. Also, teens and 20-somethings preferred to be seen having pizzas and cold coffees, and naadan delicacies were restricted to toddy shops, which are not everyones cup of tea.Cut to 2018. Take a drive around Kochi or Thiruvananthapuram city and you can spot at least a dozen restaurants and coffee shops, nay, chayakkadas, where everything  from the restaurant name to the dishes to the dcor scream a combination of innovation, quirkiness and naadan like never before. Thaninaadan is even better than naadan is the USP, and the dishes offered would perhaps be the best and healthiest picks from the kitchens of mothers and grandmothers from across Kerala. And gorging on the kanjis, pothichorus and chutta meens (fried fish) would be the selfie generation in their 20s and 30s. We explore this new food culture which has been sweeping across Kerala:As far as the youth now are concerned, the priorities are taste, health and the ambience, apparently. Dishes like kanji and kappa were traditionally considered poor mans fare, but when offered in a funky setting with tasty accompaniments, sell like hotcakes.Idli is served with non-veg curries while there are exclusive outlets like Dhe Puttu which offer innovative puttu varieties. At Pappadavada , pazhankanji is served in a chatti, with kappa, pickle, chammanthi pulisserry, curd, onion and chilly with fish curry. Minu Pauline, who runs the hotel, says, College students arrive in groups to have pazhankanji. At times, families come in to give their children a taste of pazhankanji while those older happily have it daily. This extends to desserts as well, where ilayada, kozhukkatta and even kinnathappam have replaced ice cream and pastry in these food joints.At Cinema Caf, Kacheripady, visitors sit in a world of Malayalam cinema, literally, while they munch on aval (beaten rice) or sip guava juice. Old and rare film songs play in the background while old and new film posters fill the walls and tables. People come here to get a feel of home, says its founder Nandakumar. My family members prepare the food and so half are daily customers, who know this kind of food wont harm their stomach. Malayalam film lovers get the best of both  homely food and cinema.Anoop Anthony of Njettila Vattayila , renowned for its pazhampori-beef curry combo, agrees. Youngsters today care for the ambience along with the food. Selfie spots are in plenty here. We have also printed age-old Malayalam proverbs on table tops, many of which are new to the youngsters. They lap them all up.Foodie Jay Menon attributes it to the new food culture in the State, where people are willing to travel even long distances for good food. I come down from Mumbai every month to have beef fry in Kerala. Also, people just got tired of the same kind of tastes. The freshness and variety of naadan is lacking in fast food.Not many knew about dishes like maniputtu or Ravuthar biryani, both made exclusively in Muslim houses, until they made an entry into the naadan restaurants. There are umpteen such dishes. We have a dish called kozhi kidathi porichathu which is actually my mother-in-laws recipe. We also have kanalil chutta kozhi which is chicken cooked on charcoal, says Nidheesh, founder of Arippa.Malabari dishes, once the monopoly of Kozhikode restaurants, have made a steady inflow into the rest of Kerala with the naadan restaurants re-introducing them with idiosyncratic names like veerappan chicken fry and thinnal thoofanakunna chicken fry, both specialties of Adaminte Chayakkada There are students and youngsters who eat out almost every day, and for how long can they have greasy food? We have daily customers for pazhankanji, who come in around 10 am and order it. It keeps them energised and hydrated for the entire day. All our traditional dishes suit our climate actually, says Minu.The same is the case with Aavi, where youngsters and even celebrities are the takers for kanji, says Ranjith Menon, its general manager. Everything is cooked in steam here and people seek them out. For lunch too, our pothichoru, which has fish fry, thoran, omelette, chammanthi and rice packed in a vazhayila (banana leaf), gets sold out by 1.15 pm, he says.Nidheesh attributes the new-found love for homemade food to a basic fact  we cant be bothered to cook elaborately anymore. Think of something like appam and meen molee or kappa and meenkari. Sure, they were daily fare for our grandmothers, but who makes them at home anymore? he asks.Since cooking at home daily is not an option, restaurants are becoming a necessity, says Devan, a Kochiite and foodie. We seek out restaurants which offer home-cooked food. Many of these new joints like Binnammas are run by a family, who cook the food themselves and thats why we opt for such places, he says."

Yet, except for piecemeal and futuristic announcements by the state government nothing had moved on the ground.Most victims, he said, were from the Dalit and tribal population, who had a history of living in abject poverty without proper access to social security benefits to various reasons. ""When an underprivileged person survives on a half-empty stomach, prolonged starvation will automatically lead to medical complications and trigger death. Why can't the government see the larger picture?"" he told the media on Thursday at a press conference in the wake of recent alleged hunger deaths in Giridih and Chatra.Siraj, another activist who was present at the media interaction, said he and three others had visited Giridih following reports of the death of Savitri Devi earlier this month and claimed that their findings were at variance with what the government had claimed.Savitri and her family, he claimed, were compelled to starve because of government apathy.""The government said Savitri's widow pension was credited to her account in April 2018. But that is a half-truth. She had applied for widow pension in January 2014 and received her first payment in April 2018. Despite necessary approvals, her pension wasn't credited because officials had not linked her account to her UID,"" he said, displaying video footage of the local mukhiya and her family members issuing statements.Siraj said Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) was in a shambles in Giridih. ""Savitri's household has a job card (JH19005010005/12), but the last time she got work, to build a doba (pond) under the scheme was for 11 days in 2016. Neither she nor her daughters in-law were members of any self-help group. As for as ration card, when they applied two months back, the mukhiya suggested they go to the local block office and fill a form online. Her family said they went a few times but stopped thereafter,"" he claimed, raising the question why the government had not acted on the delay in her widow pension.Swati Narayan, an activist who had accompanied a team to Chatra where a ragpicker, Meena Musahar, had died in June, raised similar questions.""According to Meena's neighbours, she was so malnourished that she could not feed her infant child who died a week before. She did not have a ration card. The state government has conveniently absolved itself of any responsibility as she may have come from Gaya in Bihar in search of livelihood. Doesn't the Food Security Act guarantee food to all?"" Swati said.Another activist spoke of the death of Chitaman (50) of Mandu, Ramgarh. He claimed Chitaman died of extreme deprivation and lack of food.Drze said the deaths of 12 people in the last year indicated how they all lost their lives due to constant denial of subsidised rice either because of the absence of a ration card or because of the failure of Aadhaar-based biometric authentication.""It is also true many were ill. But perhaps they would not have succumbed if they received adequate nutrition and medical care. Denial of social security pensions and absence of work under NREGS further contributed to the destitution of the starvation victims and their families,"" he said.Drze said the best way to address these issues was to universalise the public distribution system in rural areas and include nutritious items in PDS rations. ""The government cries financial aspects, but it is any time better than denying people right to dignified living,"" he said.The activists also demanded a rollback of DBT (direct benefit transfer) of funds currently on as a pilot in Nagri block of Ranchi.""We said long back that it was a failure. Now, the government's own social audit report says so. Moreover, we learnt that the government recently wrote to the Centre requesting permission to discontinue the Nagri DBT pilot arguing that it violates the National Food Security Act. Then why was it started in the first place?"" Drze pointed out."

Pictures by Manob ChowdharySilli (Ranchi): Veteran voter Prahlad Mahto, 58, standing on the side of the dilapidated road leading to Ichahatu village of Rahe block in Silli constituency, some 75km from the capital, claimed to be somewhat confused on Wednesday on whom to vote in the Assembly bypoll on May 28.It promises to be a heated bipolar election for Kurmi-dominated Silli constituency.Many-time MLA and BJP ally Ajsu Party chief Sudesh Mahto, out of power and desperately seeking a comeback, is locking horns with JMM's first-timer Seema Mahto, who however enjoys the backing of her husband Amit Mahto, former MLA, and a united Opposition. Amit, recently stripped off his MLA tag after his conviction in an old criminal case, had defeated sitting Silli MLA Sudesh in one of the biggest upsets of 2014 Assembly polls, and continues to enjoy sizeable popularity.Asked who did a better job with the constituency, Sudesh or Amit, Prahlad is unsure. ""Sudesh had facilitated the construction of this road from his MLA funds in 2011 - 12, but it is incomplete. The condition of Silli-Rahe highway remains pitiable. We voted for Sudesh to power in 2000, 2005 and 2009.

""He helped us get Indira Awas houses, PDS ration cards and benefits from self-employment schemes,"" she added.For voters like Urmila, Sudesh is the contrite son of the soil who is now admitting to his mistakes.In many of his campaign speeches, Sudesh admitted that after becoming minister and deputy chief minister, he became too busy with administrative work, lost touch with his brothers and sisters and got wrong or misleading feedback from his aides, but ""these won't be repeated"".Speaking fluently in Panchpargania dialect at a rally in Ichahatu village of his constituency on Wednesday, Sudesh said, ""You've been electing MLAs and MPs here since 1952, but did any development happen in Silli till 1999 (the year he was first elected)? Did anything good happen here in the past three years (Amit's MLA tenure)? Today, all Opposition parties have ganged up against me. But, I am not at all worried as I have your blessings.""He added that as road construction minister, he built approach roads at the native villages of JMM's Shibu Soren and Amit Mahto.""Once I become your MLA again, BDOs won't be allowed to sit in office chambers, they would be busy solving your problems at your doorstep, and PDS dealers will pay dearly if they don't give you your due foodgrain,"" he thundered. ""Don't let your ripe bananas (Ajsu party symbol) be stolen again,"" he entreated.On the other hand, political greenhorn Seema is taking confident steps too.A postgraduate from Vinoba Bhave University and in her early 30s, Seema is impressively articulate.""My husband lost his Assembly membership through treachery, and so I had to step in,"" she said. ""He wanted to ensure basic amenities for Silli. I want to complete his unfinished projects."" After a pause, she added, ""We are also against the BJP's jan-virodhi nitiyan (anti-people policies) and the way power and fuel prices are increasing.""But, the campaigns have bared their ugly side, too.Though there is no official proof, Ajsu is claiming that Amit in 2014 promised voters 70kg of rice per month and 10 gram of gold ornaments. And, on Tuesday, JVM veteran Bandhu Tirkey, in the presence of JMM's Shibu Soren and son Hemant and Congress heavyweight Subodh Kant Sahay, used expletives against Sudesh in a united Opposition rally in Seema's support.This apart, even some PDS dealers are allegedly arm-twisting ration-seekers at their outlets to vote for their chosen candidates only.Asked by this reporter about all the recent charges and counter-charges, Seema humbly folded her hands.""I am a bahu of this soil. Sudesh Mahto is my guardian and I have great respect for his wife Nehaji. I simply want to complete my husband's unfinished projects in Silli with the support and blessings of all likeminded forces,"" she said."

He was a loving husband and a doting dad to two boys who are well-educated and employed. And, he was a BJP member dedicated to the party for nearly four decades.The loss of Pankaj Gupta, the 57-year-old district BJP treasurer who was shot dead in Nagri, near the capital, on Sunday morning, is irreparable to say the least.As Gupta's last rites were performed on the banks of Koel river in Lohardaga on Monday morning, a crowd of 500-plus party workers, supporters and well-wishers stood with moist eyes and heavy heart to bid their final farewell to man they loved and respected. A man said to have a clean slate with no police record.Om Singh, a senior leader of Kisan Morcha, the BJP's farmer wing, said he felt as if someone had ""chopped off my right hand and sucked life out of my body"".""For everything - from personal issues to political matter - I was dependent on him (Gupta). Yesterday (Sunday), I spoke to him before he left for Ranchi.

The state leadership trusted his abilities and hence, he was retained as treasurer for three consecutive terms.""In the past 10 years, district presidents (of BJP) have changed, but Gupta remained our treasurer. It is an important post given to a person who has proven track record. He was a soft-spoken man and honest to the core.

I will never be able to fulfil his wish,"" Balkrishna added.Former president of Lohardaga BJP Rakesh Prasad said he remembered Gupta for his amazing record-keeping ability. ""God knows where and how he picked that habit, but he was a saviour for all of us. He filed every important document, photograph and news clip. We remained dependent on him,"" Prasad said.A few months after the 2014 general elections, Gupta had made bulk purchase of newspapers from a local scrap dealer to update his files about state and central leaders who visited Lohardaga to attend various party programmes.Prasad recalled how BJP patriarch and former deputy Prime Minister Lalkrishna Advani had praised Gupta's managerial skills during an election rally in Lohardaga.

The centre is yet to announce the date of the implementation of its scheme. By launching its own programme, which will be funded by the state's resources, the BJD government is trying to rebuff the allegations of the BJP that the state only hijacks central schemes and appropriated credit for their implementation.In fact, the BJP has currently launched a poster war across the state staking its claim to various programmes being implemented in the state, including the Naveen Patnaik government's most successful scheme to provide Re 1 rice per kilo per person.As the general and Assembly elections, scheduled to be held in 2019, approaches, the two parties are becoming increasingly assertive. Aware that the NDA government's Ujjwala scheme (free gas connections to rural poor) is gaining popularity, the Naveen Patnaik government has upstaged the BJP government's move by announcing its own health scheme before the central could come up with its own.BJD leaders feel that the health scheme would certainly help bolster the party's image among the electorate.The central and the state health schemes have more or less similar features. The two are aimed at providing cashless heath care facilities to the beneficiaries.Ayushman Bharat Yojana or National Health Protection Scheme aims to create a network of health and wellness infrastructure across the nation to deliver comprehensive primary health care services, and also provide insurance cover to at least 40 per cent of India's population that is deprived of secondary and tertiary care servicesHowever, Jena asserted that the state's plan was not to provide ""health insurance"", but ""health assurance"". People would be given free diagnostic, free treatment and free medicines in all the government hospitals.Under the scheme, a person visiting government health institutions from the district to the sub-centre level will be provided all health services free of cost. Besides, Rs 500 will be provided to all pregnant women as well as infants undergoing treatment at government hospitals to meet pick-up and drop expenses.BJP spokesperson Golak Mohapatra, however, accused the state government of acting in ""copy-paste-edit"" format and alleged that it had simply changed the nomenclature of the Centre's ""Ayushman Bharat"" scheme with the 'Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana""."

The ruling party has made it clear that the populist scheme of providing rice at the rate of Re 1 per kg would also continue even after the implementation of the act, under which 5kg subsidised rice is provided to each beneficiary per month.However, the BJP leaders have clarified that the Centre is giving Rs 29.60 towards the cost of 1kg subsidised rice, while the state's share is only Rs 2.

The project is being seen as a move to counter the Centre's Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana that seeks to provide free LPG connection to poor women.As part of the programme, the state government has decided to give each poor household four LED bulbs free of cost. The BJP sensed politics behind the move and accused the Naveen Patnaik government of being a ""copycat"".Odisha finance minister Sashi Bhusan Behera, however, refuted the charge.""There is no politics in it. The state has been promoting energy efficiency for the last six years in government offices and on city streets through use of energy efficient lighting systems.

The tug-of-war over LED lights is reminiscent of the tussle over the Re 1 rice scheme that benefits around 52 lakh people.The BJP's grudge about the rice scheme was that the BJD had tried to appropriate it without giving any credit to the Centre for supplying the subsidised grain.

The BJP's list of campaigners has the name of Shah and 39 others.In a memorandum to the state electoral officer, the BJD demanded that the expenses of all the central BJP leaders visiting Bijepur, which includes six central ministers and Shah, should be treated as the candidate's expense since Narendra Modi's party did not submit its list of star campaigners within seven days.Earlier on Thursday, the BJP had moved the state electoral officer accusing violation of model code of conduct by BJD MLA and former minister Arun Sahoo. The BJP alleged that Sahoo had lured voters with cheap rice and old age pension schemes at a meeting in Charapali panchayat in Bijepur block on February 7.The BJP had submitted video clippings to the electoral officer.

Telegraph pictureKendrapara: The erosion-hit coastal villagers of Rajnagar tehsil may well remind one of the God-fearing characters of J.M. Synge's Riders to the Sea.The Irish dramatist's play is centred on a set of deeply religious characters who find themselves at odds with an unbeatable force of nature (this being the sea), as they remain wary of its supernatural characteristics.Similarly, the sea erosion-hit villagers in the district continue to observe the annual ritual of worshipping the sea god, believing that it will tame the oceanic fury. However like Synge's play, here again, the sea continues to wreak havoc, advancing into human habitations despite the pujas and the rituals.The villagers in and around Pentha, Brahmanasahi and Satabhaya gram panchayats under Rajnagar tehsil kept on offering puja to the furious sea near Pentha and the Satabhaya coast. The puja is scheduled to continue for next couple of days.""These parts are worst hit by sea erosion as mighty waves continue to batter human settlements triggering constant alarm. The belief etched in the minds of people is that worshiping the sea might tame the extent of erosion-induced damage,"" said Jagannath Das, a local resident.Weary of danger staring at them, hundreds of local people thronged the puja site to pay obeisance to the sea god. Firm faith is that religious rituals of this nature would distract the sea from advancing into their areas.However, the advancing sea seems not satisfied with that kind of Celtic paganism. The local people, too, perceive the danger.As of now, the sea is getting restless. The sea water gets warmer as high tide lashes the villages. Low pressure and depression have become more frequent nowadays than it used to be a decade ago.In the 1960s, the seven moderately populated villages wore the look of a lush green picturesque island. The economy of the area, encircled by sea water and mangrove vegetation, was rich with immense potential for agriculture and fishing.The Basmati rice used to abundantly grow in these areas, and it had greatly augmented the local economy as the rice from these areas were much in demand in cities such as Cuttack. But with the sea eating into crop areas besides salinising the field, the Basmati cultivation has now become a thing of the past. ""Roaring waves of mighty sea have literally changed the contours and geography of the area,"" recalled Das while reminiscing the hoary past - and of course, a tinge of hope in their religious rituals."

Delay in nursery preparation leads to delayed transplantation which hits productivity.Explaining the problem caused by the delayed monsoon, an expert in the agriculture department said: ""While cultivation of medium and short duration of paddy varieties has not been hit by it, the case of long duration varieties has certainly become an issue because delay in transplantation would lead to reduced productivity.""The long duration paddy variety has a maturity period of around 150 days whereas that of medium and short duration varieties is 130 to 140 days and 100 to 110 days, respectively. As far as share of these three varieties is concerned, the long duration varieties is grown in about 30 per cent of the total paddy area whereas the medium duration varieties are cultivated in about 35 to 40 per cent area and in the remaining area, short duration varieties are grown. Bihar is aiming for paddy cultivation on around 34 lakh hectares of land with a rice production target of 102 lakh metric tonnes.Vaishali farmer Sanjiv Kumar said: ""While the input cost has gone up due to use of pumping sets for preparing the nursery, lack of moist environment is not allowing proper growth of seedlings.""Agriculture minister Prem Kumar said: ""We are providing diesel subsidy to farmers for nursery preparation and Rs 60 crore would be sent to districts within a week.""Under the diesel subsidy scheme, farmers get Rs 37 per litre of diesel and they are given 10 litres of diesel for preparing one acre of nursery. The subsidy is given for two irrigation and one farmer can avail it for a maximum of five acres of land.Amid this step of the agriculture department, the Patna Met office on Thursday maintained that the monsoon was likely to reach Bihar latest by June 26 or even before that.""The conditions have become favourable and in the next 48 hours thunder related events would take place after which the intensity of rain would increase. Monsoon would reach the state latest by June 26 or even before that,"" Patna Met office scientist Anand Shankar said.He said now the possibility of heat wave-like conditions was very thin and the temperature would be around 40C in the next 48 hours and after that it would decrease due to the rain."

The international institution has also set up its south Asia regional centre at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.Agriculture minister Prem Kumar said he urged the institute team to provide paddy varieties to Bihar which could withstand the vagaries of nature as Bihar had 21 flood-prone districts in its northern parts and 17 drought-prone districts in the southern region.""I have been informed that International Rice Research Institute has developed a paddy variety whose plant does not get damaged even if it remains under water for 15 days. This could be very useful for north Bihar districts and urged the team to develop such a variety which could survive up to one month despite being under water. Similarly, I drew the team's attention towards the water problem in south Bihar districts and requested to provide varieties which could give good productivity even when there is a scarcity of water,"" Prem said while sharing the details of the meeting.Paddy cultivation is being done in 33 lakh hectares in Bihar and the state produced around 71 lakh metric tonnes of rice last year. Productivity-wise the state stands at sixth place in the country. Even within the state there are wide variations in productivity and while it is around 2,000kg per hectare in the Bhojpur region, its level comes down to around 1,000 kg per hectare in the Bhagalpur region.The minister also announced that the agriculture department would provide land to the International Rice Research Institute in its farms both in north and south Bihar so that the institute could demonstrate the benefits of using its paddy varieties among farmers."

The largest chunk of the welfare schemes targeting children and youth has been reserved for SCs and STs.""The state government has decided to provide 15kg of foodgrain per month - rice and wheat - to every student staying in the hostels meant for SCs, STs, EBCs, OBCs and the minority communities.

Altogether 12,000 students reside in them.The decision is significant because till now these students had to bring ration from home which was cooked in the hostel mess. Moreover, people covered under the Food Security Act get only five kg foodgrain per person per month.""Our government has also decided to provide 'hostel grant' of Rs 1,000 per month to every SC and ST hostel inmate,"" Anjani said.The Nitish government also decided to provide Rs 50,000 to SC and ST students who qualify in the civil services preliminary examination conducted by the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) and Rs 1 lakh to those who clear the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) civil services prelims.""Boys and girls belonging to SC and ST categories qualify in UPSC and BPSC prelims and need financial support to prepare for the mains examinations - buy books, take admission in coaching institutes.

Under the scheme, each student will be given 15kg subsidised foodgrain every month at hostels meant for Dalits, tribals, backward castes and minorities.The scheme has even been extended to private hostels - with the rider that 2/3rd of its inmates must belong to these categories. ""Around 1 crore underprivileged students across the country would benefit from the scheme,"" Paswan said. ""We have no shortage of foodgrain and the scheme can be started immediately and states have been asked to specify the quantity of foodgrain they require for the scheme.""Subsidised foodgrain for SC/ST/OBC hostels was already being given in Andhra Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Tripura, Nagaland and Dadar and Nagar Haveli.

The students have to take up farming at least in a small piece of land along with whatever work they do.Earlier, delivering the keynote address, Agriculture Science Centre Head Dr Shivkumar Magada said that it is the first time that Krishi Mela is organised by techies who have started an app that help farmers to market their produce for better price.App launchedAs a part of the programme, Agriculture Department joint director Kempe Gowda H launched 'farmsurge,' a mobile app, that is aimed at improving the profitability of farmers through progressive farming that decreases input costs, increases production, connecting them digitally with agriculture input companies, new markets, agro researchers, financial institutes, farm service providers and takes full advantage of government assistance. 'Farmsurge' is an on-demand digital platform that allows farmers to find, connect, share, buy and sell farmneeds.Stating that the government has granted Rs 8 lakh to develop the app to Arunya Foundation, he said a sum of Rs 4 lakh has already been released. There are many provisions in the app and a separate group, such as coconut growers, paddy growers or pepper growers, can be created for easy usage.Campco president S R Sathishchandra and Krishi Sangama honorary president U Rajesh Naik were present.StallsInteractive training workshops for farmers by scientists and researchers on selected topics, such as Crop Selection Practices, Modern Harvesting Practices and Equipment Training Practices are part of the two-day event.A number of farm-related items are on display with live demonstration on how to use particular tools and equipment at particular crop fields so that farmers will obtain knowledge on its usage.Many school children visited the Krishi Sangama as well as Oddur Farms, an inspiring example of the efforts made by Rajesh Naik to transform 120 acres of barren land into a lush green farm through his persistent efforts. The farm with multiple organic farm and dairy is a model farm for farmers."

It is a fight between the Congress that is engaged in caste, money power and communal polarisation and the BJP that believes in development. No room will be left for the formation of a coalition government in Karnataka,"" said Javadekar.""Only in the BJP a tea-seller could become prime minister and a person from a Dalit community could become President of India. The Congress is engaged in divide and rule policy and does not speak of development. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is keen on an alliance with the SDPI. He has shown a soft corner towards terror organisations,"" he alleged.Javadekar further said, ""A minister moves with rowdies in Mangaluru. The government has been recompensing the family of a man with criminal background who dies in an encounter. However, the government thinks twice to issue compensation when a Hindu is murdered. There is a need to oppose such vote bank politics.""Using the subsidised rice given by the Centre, the state government has implemented ""Anna bhagya"" scheme. In reality, it should have been named ""Modi Bhagya,"" he said.Javadekar alleged that although the Centre has released Rs 1,000 crore for the development of Mangaluru International Airport, the state government has failed to take up the work. Similarly, the land acquisition process has not been completed for the Kulshekar-Karkala-Shivamogga highway in spite of releasing grant.Later, he announced the ""Karnataka Vikas Ka Jodi Yeddyurappa Modi.""In UdupiUnion Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the Congress will be wiped out totally from the country's political scenario.Speaking at the meeting held for the district BJP members on Tuesday, the Union minister said that the Congress would pay for its arrogant and adamant nature. Already 22 states are under the BJP rule; Karnataka would be the 23rd one, he said.""The Congress has a money culture. It is a hypocritical and corrupt party with leaders without brain. The state has become a hub for violence, with Sangh Parivar activists massacred here. People are now well aware that if they need to survive, it is only the BJP that offers a secure and stable government. Is Ahinda policy of Siddaramaiah making life better for the public?"" said the minister.Coming down heavily on Siddaramaiah and Rahul Gandhi, the minister said that both drag Gods into their political brawl. Religious and spiritual issues are also political for Congressmen. Even Rahul's temple visits did not yield better results as God could easily differentiate between the real and fake devotee. Siddaramaiah calls himself a Hindu but is against visiting Sri Krishna temple.He also ridiculed the transfer of Dakshina Kannada Superintendent Sudhir Kumar Reddy calling it only for the sake of his stringent action against sand mafia. Sincere bureaucrats are transferred for reasons unknown. The Election Commission strictly prohibits the transfer of officers during elections. However the state government is into unethical deeds.He added that, in Karnataka, Tipu Jayanti is celebrated grandly but Vivekananda's birth anniversary is forgotten. The law and order mechanism is being totally spoiled. The police are puppets in the hands of the government and the ministers. The government failed to nab the killers of Kalburgi, Gauri Lankesh and Sangh Parivar activists.MahadayeeThe Union minister said that he would try convincing the Goa chief minister over Mahadyee river row. The issue is unnecessarily being dragged by the Congress government. He challenged the Congress to convince the Opposition in the Goa Assembly.He also alleged that the impending statewide protest on January 25 is the conspiracy by the Congress-led state government. The issue had been taken to the court by the UPA government and at present Congress deserves no right to condemn the matter in favour of Karnataka.State bandh on January 25MP Shobha Karandlaje accused the state government of calling for a state bandh on January 25, for fear of facing BJP leader Amit Shah, who is to visit Karnataka as party of his campaign rally.The citizens will recognise these as tricks by the government and give the Congress a fitting answer, she said."

We had detailed discussions on bilateral and global issues. Our talks will add further vigour to the India-China friendship,"" Modi tweeted after the meeting.Recalling that he and Prime Minister Modi successfully had an informal meeting and reached important consensus in Wuhan, President Xi said the meeting had been well received by both countries and the international community, and a positive atmosphere is taking shape to pay close attention to and support the development of China-India relations.China is willing to work with India to take the Wuhan meeting as a ""new starting point"" to continuously enhance political mutual trust and engage in mutually beneficial cooperation across the board, so as to push forward China-India relations in a better, faster and steadier manner, Xi was quoted as saying by China's state-run Xinhua news agency.Briefing the media on the Modi-Xi meeting, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said it was ""very positive and forward-looking"" with both leaders lauding the spirit of the Wuhan summit.President Xi has accepted Prime Minister Modi's invitation for an informal summit in India in 2019, Gokhale said, adding that the dates and other formalities will be worked out later through diplomatic channels.China's defence minister, as well as the Minister for Public Security, will visit India.Both sides agreed that the next round of talks of the Special Representatives on the boundary question will be held in the second half of this year. So far 20 rounds of talks have been held to resolve the boundary issue.The two leaders agreed to maintain strategic communications and meet on the sidelines of international meetings. The next Modi-Xi meeting would take place in South Africa in July on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in July, he said.India and China have agreed to set up a mechanism to enhance people-to-people exchanges. The new mechanism would be headed by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Chinese State Councilor Wang Yi. The first meeting of the new mechanism would be held this year, Gokhale said.President Xi suggested that the two countries should set a new trade target of USD 100 billion by 2020. India will allow China's state-owned Bank of China to establish a branch in Mumbai.The meeting between the leaders of two Asian powers came after their informal summit in the Chinese city of Wuhan to solidify the relationship in a broad spectrum of areas and ensuring better coordination between the border guarding forces of the two countries after the Doklam standoff.After their talks in Wuhan, Modi and Xi had decided to issue ""strategic guidance"" to their militaries to strengthen communications to build trust and understanding as part of efforts to avoid a Doklam-like situation in the future.The two leaders had also discussed ways to give impetus to their economic ties as well as people-to-people relations.Modi arrived here on a two-day visit to attend the annual SCO summit.The ties between the two neighbouring nuclear powers had nosedived following last year's Doklam standoff as well as due to a number of other issues including China blocking India's move to get Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar banned by the UN and its opposition to India's bid for the Nuclear Suppliers Group membership.China's Belt and Road Initiative was also strongly opposed by India as part of it goes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Troops of India and China were locked in the 73-day standoff in Doklam since June 16 last year after the Indian side stopped the construction of a road by the Chinese Army in the disputed area. Bhutan and China have a dispute over Doklam. The face-off had ended on August 28.However, there have been concerted efforts by both sides to reset ties leaving behind the Doklam episode.Last week, Modi had said that Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together with trust and confidence while being sensitive to each other's interests. Modi also said that an ""Asia of rivalry"" will hold the region back while an Asia of cooperation will shape the current century.The prime minister's comments at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore were appreciated by China."
5b2e59c69855b72640115a1d,Spicing up sweet chocolate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/664106/spicing-up-sweet-chocolate.html,2018-03-11,"The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Limited (Campco), which is well known for bailing arecanut and cocoa farmers out of distress during the price fall many years ago, is embarking on an extensive diversification-cum-expansion drive.The multi-state cooperative society between Karnataka and Kerala is all set to shake up the cashewnut and coconut markets, as part of its expansion programme.Campco was started in 1973 by its founder president Varanasi Subraya Bhat, when there was a sudden marketing crisis in arecanut.Foray into chocolatesCampco set up a chocolate factory for creating market for cocoa, when farmers were in distress in the early 1980s, with help from the Karnataka government and the Centre. The then President of India Giani Zail Singh inaugurated the facility on September 1, 1986.In fact, Campco's chocolate factory at Puttur is South India's only such facility, and the country's second in the cooperative sector. The other chocolate factory belonging to Amul (Anand Milk Union Limited) is in Gujarat.Right from 10 products (chocolate varieties) in 1986, to 23 varieties (including one drinking chocolate) today, Campco has come a long way. In fact, until 1997, all the chocolates available under the Nestle brand were supplied by Campco. Though Nestle opened its firm in 1997 in Goa, Campco continues to supply chocolates (approximately 5,000 tonnes per annum) to the MNC even to this day, says Campco Managing Director MSuresh Bhandary.New flavoursThough the products of Campco were highly affordable with a unique taste, they were not available at malls and high-end stores until two months ago. However, the recent launch of six varieties of premium chocolate (without vegetable fat) are available in many parts of India, including Karnataka, Kerala, Hyderabad, Ghaziabad, Jaipur, Punjab and Kolkata.The newly launched premium chocolates are:Moments - dark chocolate with ginger; Dietier - sugar-free dark chocolate; Milk Marvel - soft and silky milk chocolate; Milk n Milk - with chocolate with rice crispies; Fun Tan - dark chocolate with hint of mint; and Fun Tan - dark chocolate which is slightly bitter.Though each bar costs Rs 100, the gift box (with six pieces) is available for Rs 500, which are available at airports as well as malls, among other places.Besides retail sales, Campco also supplies bulk chocolates to industries, weighing up to 1 kg, 5 kg and 10 kg slabs. ""The industrial supply accounts for about 6,000 tonnes per annum,"" says Bhandary, adding that even Amul buys chocolate butter from Campco.A lesser known fact about Campco is that it supplies chocolates to the Indian Navy at the latter's Mumbai, as well as Visakhapatnam bases. ""They have purchased 23 tonnes of chocolate in the last four months,"" he says.Plans are also on the anvil to market Campco chocolates to the Armed Forces (including the Air Force and Army) and the Indian Railways, and the same is under process, says Bhandary.Currently, the capacity utilisation of the factory is more than 70%. The Campco chocolate factory at Puttur, about 60 kms from Mangaluru in Dakshina Kannada district, has the capacity to produce 23,000 tonnes per annum.Campco's share in retail chocolate market is 7% and it plans to increase the same to 12-15% in the next three years. Mondelez (earlier Cadbury) holds a majority 70% share, followed by Nestle with an estimated 15-16% share, according to Bhandary.Campco stands in the second position as far as industrial chocolates are concerned, with a production of 7,000 to 10,000 tonnes per annum.Out of 20,000 tonnes of cocoa requirement in India, up to 13,000 tonnes is procured from farmers, while the remaining 7,000 tonnes is imported from Indonesia, Malaysia and Ghana, among other countries. Out of 13,000 tonnes, about 3,600 tonnes is handled by Campco, while the remaining quantity by other handlers, Bhandary informs.He says that Campco is carrying out extensive R&D to develop more varieties of chocolate with natural ingredients.Capacity expansionEarlier this year, Campco commissioned a new amenity building at its chocolate factory in Puttur that conforms to the international food safety standards and zoning of processing area as per FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) standards, Campco President S R Satishchandra says.Built at a cost of Rs 13 crore, the building is spread over 42,000 sq feet.It has also laid the foundation stone for a master godown for arecanut, pepper and rubber at Kavu in Puttur taluk of the district. To be built at a cost of Rs 19 crore, the godown will have a built-up area of 1 lakh sq feet, and will be completed in 24 months, Satishchandra adds.It is worth mentioning here that 40% of Campco's 1,07,000 members cultivate cocoa along with arecanut in Karnataka as well as Kerala. At the same time, scientists from the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) fromVittal as well as Kasargod educate the growers on cultivation and pruning, besides providing technical guidance.The cooperative had purchased 53,720 metric tonnes of arecanut valued at Rs 1,308 crore, including 23,946 metric tonnes of red variety, valued at Rs 624 crore, and 29,774 MTof white variety, valued at Rs 684 crore, and sold 53,806 MT, valued at Rs 1,362 crore, including 24,890 MTof red variety, valued at Rs 656 crore, and 28,915 MTof white variety, valued at Rs 705 crore.Foray into new areasHitherto, Campco, with a record turnover of Rs 1,600 crore in the financial year 2017, and with a net profit of Rs 26.22 crore, was procuring directly from farmers and selling arecanut, cocoa, pepper and rubber in the states of Karnataka and Kerala.This year the cooperative is all set to enter the FMCG segment by foraying into marketing of coconut oil and cashew nuts that have good demand in the market.""Campco, during its last general body meeting, had proposed amendments to its bylaw, to market cashew, coconut products and FMCG segment, and it would be soon approved from the Central registrar,"" Bhandary says, and added that once it gets approval from the authorities concerned, it would foray into marketing of coconut oil and cashew products.""Plans are on the anvil to develop the brand, and a processing unit may be started within 12 to 15 months,""he hopes.As far as pepper is concerned, half kg packs of pepper under 'Kaala Sona' brand are already produced at Campco's Baikampady unit since the last six months.DH News Service"
5b2e5c849855b72640115ae6,Ten uses for AI-powered smartphones,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/652460/ten-uses-ai-powered-smartphones.html,2018-01-07,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) features will become a critical product differentiator for smartphone vendors that will help them acquire new customers, while retaining current users, according to global research and advisory company Gartner.As the smartphone market shifts from selling technology products to delivering compelling and personalised experiences, AI solutions running on the smartphone will become an essential part of vendor roadmaps over the next two years.Gartner predicts that by 2022, 80% of the smartphones shipped will have on-device AI capabilities, up from 10% in 2017. On-device AI is currently limited to premium devices and provides better data protection and power management than full cloud-based AI, since data is processed and stored locally. ""With smartphones increasingly becoming a commodity device, vendors are looking for ways to differentiate their products,"" says C K Lu, Research Director at Gartner.""Future AI capabilities will allow smartphones to learn, plan and solve problems for users. This isn't just about making the smartphone smarter, but augmenting people by reducing their cognitive load. However, AI capabilities on smartphones are still in very early stages,"" he adds.""Over the next two years, most use cases will still exploit a single AI capability and technology,"" says Roberta Cozza, Research Director at Gartner, adding, ""Going forward, smartphones will combine two or more AI capabilities and technologies to provide more advanced user experiences."" Gartner has identified 10 high-impact uses for AI-powered smartphones to enable vendors to provide more value to their customers.'Digital Me' Sitting on the DeviceSmartphones will be an extension of the user, capable of recognising them and predicting their next move. They will understand who you are, what you want, when you want it, how you want it done, and execute tasks upon your authority.""Your smartphone will track you throughout the day to learn, plan and solve problems for you,"" Angie Wang, Principal Research Analyst at Gartner said.""It will leverage its sensors, cameras and data to accomplish these tasks automatically. For example, in the connected home, it could order a vacuum bot to clean when the house is empty, or turn a rice cooker on 20 minutes before you arrive,"" she says.User AuthenticationPassword-based, simple authentication is becoming too complex and less effective, resulting in weak security, poor user experience, and a high cost of ownership.Security technology combined with machine-learning, biometrics and user behaviour will improve usability and self-service capabilities.For example, smartphones can capture and learn a user's behaviour, such as patterns when they walk, swipe, apply pressure to the phone, scroll and type, without the need for passwords or active authentications.Emotion RecognitionEmotion-sensing systems and effective computing allow smartphones to detect, analyse, process and respond to people's emotional states and moods. The proliferation of virtual personal assistants and other AI-based technologies for conversational systems is driving the need to add emotional intelligence for better context and an enhanced service experience.Car manufacturers, for example, can use a smartphone's front camera to understand a driver's physical condition or gauge fatigue levels to increase safety.Natural-Language UnderstandingContinuous training and deep learning on smartphones will improve the accuracy of speech recognition, while better understanding the user's specific intentions. For instance, when a user says ""the weather is cold"", depending on the context, his or her real intention could be ""please order a jacket online"" or ""please turn up the heat"".As an example, natural-language understanding could be used as a near real-time voice translator on smartphones when traveling abroad.Augmented Reality (AR) and AI VisionWith the release of iOS 11, Apple included an ARKit feature that provides new tools to developers to make adding AR to apps easier. Similarly, Google announced its ARCore AR developer tool for Android and plans to enable AR on about 100 million Android devices by the end of next year. Google expects almost every new Android phone to be AR-ready out of the box next year. One example of how AR can be used is in apps that help to collect user data and detect illnesses such as skin cancer or pancreatic cancer.Device ManagementMachine-learning will improve device performance and standby time. For example, with many sensors, smartphones can better understand and learn user behaviour, such as when to use which app. The smartphone will be able to keep frequently-used apps running in the background for quick relaunch, or to shut down unused apps to save memory and battery.Personal ProfilingSmartphones are able to collect data for behavioural and personal profiling. Users can receive protection and assistance dynamically, depending on the activity that is being carried out and the environments they are in (e.g., home, vehicle, office, or leisure activities). Service providers such as insurance companies can now focus on users, rather than the assets. For example, they will be able to adjust the car insurance rate based on driving behaviour.Content Censorship/DetectionRestricted content can be automatically detected. Objectionable images, videos or text can be flagged and various notification alarms can be enabled. Computer recognition software can detect any content that violates any laws or policies. For example, taking photos in high security facilities or storing highly classified data on company-paid smartphones will notify IT.Personal PhotographingPersonal photographing includes smartphones that are able to automatically produce beautified photos based on a user's individual aesthetic preferences. For example, there are different aesthetic preferences between the East and West - most Chinese people prefer a pale complexion, whereas consumers in the West tend to prefer tan skin tones.Audio AnalyticThe smartphone's microphone is able to continuously listen to real-world sounds. AI capability on device is able to tell those sounds, and instruct users or trigger events. For example, a smartphone hears a user snoring, then triggers the user's wristband to encourage a change in sleeping positions."

On Tuesday, their armies agreed to ""fully implement"" a 2003 ceasefire agreement.""In case of any issue, restraint will be exercised and the matter will be resolved through utilisation of existing mechanisms of hotline contacts and border flag meetings at local commander's level,"" Pakistan's military said in a statement.Bacchan Lal, the headman of Abdullian village in Jammu and Kashmir, who has been living in a college with 350 other people over the past two weeks, said such agreements rarely last long.""They agree to respect the ceasefire several times every year but then they violate it again. Every time people are killed, cattle perish and we end up in such camps,"" he said. ""We are in camps for the second time this year. We don't want this uncertainty. We want permanent peace as we had 30 years ago"".Farmer Chuni Lal, 45, said he was worried about a delay in sowing premium Basmati rice this year because of the hostility. He said tillers like him could not afford to miss the key planting season, urging the countries to find a lasting solution to the regular outbreaks of firing.Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, who runs the state with the support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party, welcomed the ceasefire agreement.""This brings great relief to the people residing in the vicinity,"" she said on Twitter on Wednesday. ""Peace on our borders is the first essential step to a larger understanding and I truly hope it sustains.""Tensions between the two sides had escalated since an attack on an Indian army camp in February that India blamed on Pakistan. Islamabad regularly denies Indian allegations that it trains and arms militants and helps them infiltrate across the so-called Line of Control that divides Kashmir."

We received the post-mortem report. In the opinion of the doctors, the death was due to asphyxia due to hanging, anti-mortem and suicidal in nature,"" said Akash Magharia, the superintendent of police, Purulia.Bengal BJP leaders contested the post-mortem report and said they would move the high court seeking a CBI probe into Dulal's death.Some local Trinamul leaders this newspaper spoke to said the post-mortem report revealed the truth and exposed the BJP's politics with bodies.Shortly after Magharia's news conference was broadcast live, Trinamul's secretary general Partha Chatterjee said: ""The BJP is left with no political issue now. They are only trying to malign Trinamul, but the post-mortem report states it as a suicide.""BJP national president Amit Shah had condemned the deaths and accused the Mamata Banerjee government of failing to maintain law and order in Bengal.The politics over the death prompted the state government to bring in Magharia in place of Joy Biswas, who was the SP of Purulia till Saturday.The Bengal government also ordered a CID probe into the death of Dulal and another BJP worker in Purulia. A CID team visited Balarampur on Sunday.A senior police officer said the state's response to the deaths was unusual, referring to the involvement of five doctors in Dulal's post-mortem.""I can't recall an incident in which five doctors were involved in a post-mortem. The decision was taken probably in the wake of the controversy surrounding the death,"" said the officer, not connected with the case.According to him, the post-mortem was conducted in record time as the report came on Sunday.Dulal's family and a section of residents of Dava, where he used to live, refused to accept the suicide theory. ""We were a happy family with our three children. He was absolutely normal when I saw him last time on Friday evening. He took food for my father-in-law, who was at our shop in the village,"" said Monika, Dulal's wife.Mahabir, the deceased BJP worker's father, echoed Monika. ""We have a paddy thrashing shop and we sell rice bran. We don't have any financial problems.

Photographs by Paromita Kar9am: We are still a few kilometres from the forests of Lalgarh in Jhargram, where the grand event would unfold. Thousands of people from the bush and surrounding villages would gather in Jangalmahal - the forested belt straddling Purulia, Bankura, West Midnapore and Birbhum. It is April 13, another day marked by tribals for a hunt.Hunting is not a rare occasion in these parts. Only a few days ago - on March 27 - the additional divisional forest officer of Midnapore, Purabi Mahato, fell at the feet of Adivasi elders to dissuade them from going inside the forest. It might disturb the tiger, she had pleaded. Some hunters went back, but many others didn't.A full-grown Royal Bengal tiger had strayed into these forests, but where from the authorities hadn't been able to ascertain. Camera traps installed by the WWF-India had confirmed the visitor's presence in early March. Subsequently, there were attempts to catch the big cat - in order to move it to a more suitable habitat - but in vain. Two guards even lost their lives in the line of duty, although their deaths were due to suffocation inside their car and not because the beast had mauled them.9.20am: We are passing through the village of Pirakata. There is a lengthy procession of devotees. Most of them are children. They are balancing on their slender shoulders bamboo sticks with earthen pots hanging from either end.Further down the road, flanked by fields, are a couple of open trucks, fitted with loudspeakers. They are playing Bambaiya filmi music. Groups of men, bright red and pink ribbons tied around their heads, are hanging around, enjoying the festive air. Their pots of sacred water peep out of the trucks. There are others riding bicycles with their holy contraptions. A little dilution in rituals and traditions never hurt anyone, after all.9.45am: The metal road eventually gives way to a red one. An armed guard signals us to stop. He briefly surveys the inside of the car, while his two female associates sit under a neem tree a few metres away.10am: We enter the forest. Deeper. Deeper. The more it closes in on us, the more we become aware of our diminutiveness. A different set of rules and equations play out in shades of green and brown, suffused with the humming of insects, each a pitch of its own. It is as though the scorching heat has turned on all the sounds and smells. The scent of eucalyptus sometimes spews about distinct, through the glowing sal. At least, there is not much dust... only small and big puddles on the brilliant red earth.""These parts are khoni, khoni (treasure),"" cries out Arabinda. He is part of the team of young conservationists visiting the forest. ""The last time I was here, I saw the most beautiful sight - a pregnant wolf slinking away."" Lalgarh's forests are still home to the wild boar, rabbit, fishing cat or baghrul, which is the state animal, the Bengal fox and others. But Arabinda knows that the organic alliances that make up this precious forestland are under serious threat. ""The deer, pangolin and porcupine... shob shesh, wiped out,"" he laments.GROUND ZERO: (From top) Young Adivasis with their hunting equipment; womenfolk preparing handiya; a snack of the leftover rice and chilli powder; Badal Hansda, who was injured by the tiger, at Midnapore Sadar HospitalTwenty minutes down the road, we spot the first hunter. He is past his prime but rugged and strong. In one hand he holds a borsha (spear fitted to a long, sturdy bamboo). An axe rests on his shoulder. The man is, however, in no mood to speak to strangers, or even acknowledge our presence as we stop the car and roll down the windows.A few minutes away, in a small clearing, we come upon a hunting party. There are about 20-odd men, some sitting on a broken culvert. They haven't chanced upon a kill yet and speak with caution, as if not wanting to let out the secrets of the task in which they excel. Some of them are from Jhitka, a tiny hamlet on the forest outskirts; others are from villages further away. They are headed to Pakhibaand, where hunters from all directions are supposed to assemble after killing their trophy animals.The name Pakhibaand brings to mind an image - a textbook image of an expanse of water with birds fluttering on top. Is it someplace where birds come down for a vacation? No one can tell. Not even Hembrom, the old man who waves at us for a lift. He is 86, has only one arm and is carrying an axe. But you don't look your age, I say. He replies: ""I have three cows; the milk keeps me strong and able."" And then proudly adds, ""Today you will see what an Adivasi hunt is all about; come with me."" And the missing hand? ""I was shot at... years ago,"" he says. No further explanation offered.A few empty vans rest along the bumpy path. The mud houses - with roofs of tin and asbestos - appear abandoned, with not a soul near them. Only the calls of a myriad birds ring about, as if to remind that they are watching.Everyone is where the action is. The shikar utsab is a big draw - in spite of the strict laws against hunting - and even non-Adivasis of the area and those in far-off villages and towns participate in it.10.30am: All along the way, there is no sign of any regulation. At Dherua village, the forest department's beat office is small and insignificant. ""Sometimes the authorities put up barricades - simply, bamboo sticks thrown across the kuchcha path - that serve as a signal, however weak, for the incoming trucks and vans to stop. None of that seems to be in place today,"" rues Meghna Banerjee, a lawyer by profession and wildlife activist by passion. ""I had intimated the additional principal chief conservator of forests about the event, and he had assured action would be taken,"" she adds.A few days ago, the divisional forest officer of Midnapore, Rabindranath Saha, too had said that hunters come in from as far as Bankura and even neighbouring Odisha. ""March 27 is part of their annual events calendar,"" Saha had said. ""But in our eyes, it's hunting and prohibited by law... Efforts are on at various levels to bring change, more so at the interface of technological advancement and the younger generations.""Most wildlife conservationists, however, say that the efforts are not enough. ""The number of hunting events has increased over the last many years, in a clear departure from the original calendar,"" points out Banerjee.11.15am: Pakhibaand is an open-air stage teeming with people, who have turned it into a makeshift bazaar. Chopped sal branches have been dug into the dry ground and strung over with tarpaulin sheets to create patches of shade. Women are sitting under these with huge hindalium vessels full of handiya, the local brew. The air is thick with the pungent-sweet smell of fermentation. Some of it is in the final stage of preparation. ""Khaabey?"" asks a woman, laughing, as she squashes clods of rice and strains the liquid through a piece of cloth.Some folks are frying alur chop, some selling bidis and biscuits, and yet others minding mounds of spicy gram and jhuri bhaja.11am: Evidently, most of the crowd has gathered to cheer and partake of the spectacle. About a hundred metres away, through a wide crack in the earth, runs a trickle of muddy water. Some are scooping up the water in bowls and plastic cans.The hunters have spread in all directions, says old man Hembrom. They will be back here after they have got their kill. And then, you will not find even an inch of space to stand on, he boasts. Later, we learnt that the turnout that day was over 10,000.One of them, a particularly chatty 30-something, takes it upon himself to set out the happenings around us. Our desi dogs are very smart, he says, patting one that lies at his feet. He describes in detail how they make excellent watchdogs. They also know exactly which (wild) hen to pounce on, but will never even get close to a boar. Wild boars can be tough game, and can even kill a man. A couple of hunters injured themselves that day.Our man continues. I am a Muslim fellow. I have been driving a van for seven years now, bringing hunting parties to this place. Sometimes they pay me, sometimes they pay for the petrol, he said. Then edging closer, adds, We are such good friends, we can even die for each other.11.45am: We resume our trek. We are now going deeper into the jungle in search of the hunters and the hunted. Our young companions are determined to note as much as they can. To me, however, the sheer enormity of the arena is overpowering, and appears to render such efforts futile.After an hour of dodging low hanging branches, frogs, geckos, nests of red ants and what not, I have given out very strong signals, to stop. Hereon, two members continue on their way, while three of us wait. I settle on the warm dry floor, in an effort to keep myself above water. The breeze is surprisingly cool in my face, perhaps because I know what the forest heat is like. In that concurrence of time, place and action only my sense of hearing seems to work, and how!There is the distant but intermittent dhook dhook, which someone suggests is from a faraway sound box. There is an assortment of birdcalls  to warn, ridicule or entertain, I cannot tell. Then there is the sound of shuffling feet and hushed voices  hunters keeping an eye on us.Phone connectivity is an idea under construction, and sustenance sips off a pale orange energy drink. When we stray from the set path, a sinister sound checks our steps  the sound of trees being chopped.1.50pm: After about two long hours, we are back at Pakhibaand. By then the smell of handiya has grown much stronger and the buzz louder. Many of the revellers are lying on the ground, unable to move, but perhaps a big part of their being is in another realm.The men are trooping in with the dead animals tied to their bows and arrows, spears and axes. As old man Hembrom had foretold, soon there will be no space for us.There is nothing that the jungle hasnt given us, says a man who has come from another village, with two others, on a bike. Why should we be afraid of the jungle?Among the dead animals that day are 15 jungle cats, 30 boars and an equal number of rabbits.3.30pm: We just about begin our return journey when we get the big news. The tiger has been killed. From the beat office at Dherua, where two uniformed guards lie on the grass in the shade of a magnificent tree, we speed in the other direction, towards Chandra village.Earlier in the day, two hunters were injured when their paths crossed with the tigers.The beast was killed by a group of hunters in Baghghora. When those men formed a circle around it and attacked it with spears, it was apparently enjoying a meal  a boar. And to think just then, we were only a few kilometres away.Back in the car and heading home. Something growls making my companions start. I discreetly clutch the handbag closer to my stomach. Which too is growling with hunger. Such a long journey."

The state is not authority to provide seat reservation, the Centre has the authority to do so,"" he said.Limbus and Tamangs, who were granted Scheduled Tribe status in 2002, has long been demanding reservation of seats for them in the Assembly. The ruling SDF, too, supports the demand. Recently, the BJP had claimed that it was the only party capable of delivering the demand.Without naming the BJP, Chamling, however, said people wouldn't be fooled by the BJP claim. ""A party from outside said recently that it alone was capable of providing seat reservation to the Limbus and Tamangs. Can a party provide reservation? Are we all fools?"" he asked.Observers said Chamling's raking up of the reservation issue in the West district was significant because the two communities, particularly the Limbus, had a huge presence in the district, which has eight seats in the Assembly.""Chamling has embarked on his campaign keeping in mind the Assembly elections which are slated for the middle of next year. Reservation is expected to be a major issue in the West district during the elections because of the massive presence of Limbus there. By passing on the buck of reservation to the Centre, Chamling is trying to keep his Limbu support base intact,"" said an observer.During the last Assembly elections in 2014, the ruling SDF had made a complete sweep of the West district by winning all the eight seats.In fact, it is the party's performances in the West and South districts that had saved the SDF blushes because its rival, Sikkim Krantikari Morcha, had bagged as many as 8 out of the 12 seats in the East district. SDF had come back to power for the fifth term by winning 22 out of the 32 seats in the Sikkim Assembly.Chamling also reminded that it was his party and government which were instrumental in granting tribal status to the Limbus and Tamangs in 2002. ""In 1976, the Limbus and Tamangs were not made tribals by the then government. Had they been made tribals then, all other Nepali communities would have got tribal status by now. Again in 1987, the two communities were similarly denied. In 2002, it was we who wanted them to be tribals.""Both in 1976 and 1987, Sikkim was governed by the Nar Bahadur Bhandari-headed Sikkim Sangram Parishad.Referring to the ban on non-organic vegetables, Chamling said the government had made the decision in the interest of the Sikkimese people, particularly the rural populace, and it will stand by it.""All must take up organic farming...no vegetables will come from outside. Potatoes and onions are allowed to be brought from outside this year, but they will not be allowed next year. Only rice and salt will be allowed,"" he said, while announcing some sops for the local farmers to encourage them to grow more vegetables."

But there is no such plan in case of Birbhum where 12-odd rice mills supplied 26,000 tonnes of poor quality rice,"" said a senior official. In Nadia, the figure for such poor-quality rice is about 1,000 tonnes.Unlike Nadia, the government has decided to give a chance to the mills in Birbhum to replace the poor-quality rice.According to the reports with the food and supplies department, such rice for Khadyasathi - the scheme through which the government supplies cheap rice to two crore people in the state - was given out through seven to eight ration shops spread across four panchayats in the Karimpur block of Nadia.But the allegations appear more serious in Birbhum where the mills supplied rice to a larger area that included the Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore districts from where complaints were lodged with the department.""The allegation is more serious in Birbhum as the allegations have been levelled against several rice mills and it appears a pre-planned conspiracy,"" said an official.Food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mallick visited Birbhum on Thursday and rapped officials.""But nobody in the government tried to identify the mills and blacklist them,"" said an official in the district."

Four persons were arrested and the case is pending in court.Mafizuddin was survived by his 12 children - nine daughters and three sons - and wife Naseda Begum.

She has no power or authority to keep returning files all the time. If she works according to the rules, there will be no issues at all, Narayanasamy told DH in an interview.Narayanasamy and Kiran have been at loggerheads ever since they took over in 2016 as chief minister and Lt governor respectively.While the chief minister accuses Kiran of overstepping her authority, the former IPS officer asserts that she was acting within the parameters of the Constitution that gives her powers as the administrator.The former Union minister said problems stem due to non-adherence of rules by Kiran and accused her of being interested only in publicity and acting at the behest of the BJP.It is not only the government functionaries, people are also against her (Kiran). Recently, we saw how she put spokes in the free rice scheme formulated by my government. She withdrew the order of linking cleanliness with free rice after an uproar across the country. She was forced to eat her own words, he said, referring to the governor's controversial order linking cleanliness with free rice scheme.He also took objection to Kiran sharing official communication between the CM and L-G on Twitter and Facebook.I am not against their use. If everything can be shared on social media, why do we even have Official Secrets Act? There is a certain amount of classified information in the government and they cannot be released openly. Why should she release the secrets? She is behaving as if she is the only champion of social media, he said."

The guests were also told that they could take more than one sapling if they wished to.Biswajit, with his baby daughter Bipasha in the arms, along with wife Soma, joined the catering team to distribute the saplings of guava, mango, papaya and some flower plants among the invitees.Nearly 600 saplings were handed over to the guests.""My objective was to compensate to some extent trees that are being felled by the NH34 authorities. It was painful to see over 100 big trees being chopped down to clear land for NH34's widening. I heard that big trees could be relocated but here, I did not see any such initiative. So, I decided to cut down on the menu for the dinner and distribute saplings among my guests for planting . If the guests could save at least half of the saplings, it will be good,"" said Biswajit.""Initially, I had planned for a lot of traditional Bengali delicacies for the dinner, but later, limited it to five items only to purchase the saplings from a local nursery,"" he added.Biswajit's wife Soma said: ""When I came to Santipur after my marriage two years ago, I saw there were many trees around but they are gradually disappearing.

Ever since taking over as the administrator, she has had constant run-ins with the elected Congress government headed by Chief Minister V Narayanaswamy.In this free-wheeling interview with ETB Sivapriyan of Deccan Herald, Bedi talks about her two-year experience in Puducherry, the controversial order linking cleanliness with free rice distribution and her equation with the CM. Excerpts:It has been almost two years since you assumed office as Lt Governor of Puducherry. How would you sum up your experiences in this tiny Union territory?Puducherry is the most beautiful part of India. One realises it only when one visits it. Just because it is far away from New Delhi, it got away in the past, even when it messed up in many ways. It has not had a sustained honest administration. Due to which it does not even have proper policies in place. Not even a vision document. But the good news is, it has nature gifted resources to deliver provided the systems are put in place and people are made partners in its growth and sustainability.Puducherry has an abundance of tourism potential and spiritual wealth lying untapped still. It also has well-meaning officers at all levels. The process has just begun with pumping in of financial resources from the Government of India in many areas. We now should ensure these are honestly invested, managed without overruns. Puducherry must develop right revenue generating models and oversight systems.On assuming office, you said you will hold the post of L-G only for two years. Are you going to stick to your decision or have you reconsidered it since the deadline is nearing?Serving Puducherry has turned into a mission for me. I will like to serve it for some more time till I find the new officers team is well settled. We have a good team of civil service officers in leadership. They need care and support.Will you give yourself one more year, next year, as well?Yes, I do hope so. However, getting transferred is not in my hands.Recently, you linked cleanliness of villages with free rice distribution scheme and there was an opinion that you were trying to penalise the common man for the failure of the administration. Do you think the issue could have been handled in a better way?I was impatient to see a clean and healthy village. I withdrew the conditional order because I could not explain to the people my intention. Hence, I was misconstrued. I do not know Tamil. However, I have found other good means of getting villages clean. But I still need to be patient.What are the other good means that you have found? What do you mean when you say you need to be patient?By training commune commissioners to work closely with rural communities and to take the lead themselves. We also plan to spread awareness on the health benefits of good sanitation and Shramdaan as Gandhiji taught us.You have had running battles with the chief minister of Puducherry (Narayanaswamy) over several issues. What do you have to say about it?I have been only chasing garbage, unclean ponds, open defecation clean ups, improving training skills for youth, trying to create a work culture of trust and internal communication, opening Raj Nivas to people, and more. Of course, I certainly respond and counter statements when I need to put the record straight. People have a right to know fully.What about the CM? Does he come for meetings?Yes, he does. As do members of the Cabinet.Does not the war of words and lack of coordination between the L-G and CM affect administration?Yes, it does. But then, one should give ones best within limitations and know how to get the work done and, therefore, should work harder. My sustained Open House for people and weekend rounds are some of the evidences of this. These keep us ahead of the curve.There have been so many incidents of war of words between you and the CM. Why do you think it happens?I understand where he comes from. He is what he is. Perhaps, he needs to believe that everything we have done is for his Puducherry, as he is the native of this place. I am temporary. He is permanent here. He is the biggest beneficiary.Are you saying that except for the CM, everyone else is cooperating?Yes, they do. They do appreciate that in certain matters, the buck stops at L-G secretariat. Hence, it is in their interest to stay in communication.The CM says the BJP is behind you and you take instructions from the PM?The prime minister is the prime minister of the country. Puducherry is a Union territory, too. But I have never received any message from Government of India for any illegal or unconstitutional act.Is there any chance of rapprochement with the CM or inviting him for a cup of coffee to sort out the issues because everyone accepts that the war of words is affecting administration?We did it. He (Narayanaswamy) played a big sport by accepting my request and peoples request to translate my speech to Tamil at the annual festival of Puducherry Kamban Kazhagam. I thanked him for it.Despite the Madras High Court validating the nomination of three BJP leaders as MLAs, the Speaker refused to allow them inside the House. What is your opinion on this and do you think there should be a review on the powers of Speaker?The matter is before the HC. The final order is awaited.Do you think the post of LG is being politicised? Not just in Puducherry, but in general?It is a fact of social life now. The key is what is delivered with what purpose."
5b2e78f89855b74d9fcd4ff7,"Cock, Roosting",https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/cock-roosting-200873?ref=west-bengal-new-stry,2018-01-14,"Paromita KarRocky has fought many bloody battles. He is lean, fair and tall, his aggression obvious in the way he jerks his glistening muscular neck to look you in the eye. He is no ordinary alpha, but of a certain Tamil lineage that is famed for male prowess. So much so that if two such fellas cross paths, they are sure to fly at each other's throat, almost out of compulsion.Most roosters are like that - they have an innate belligerence that, with grooming and training, renders them akin to professional performers of the arena. That perhaps explains why cockfighting is the world's oldest spectator sport.The history of raising fowl for fighting goes back thousands of years and despite regulations, cockfighting continues to entertain the masses in many parts of the world, including India. Many archaeologists claim that chickens were first domesticated not for eating but for cockfighting.Rocky's owner, Dilip Pal, is proud of his protege's record. ""He will fly at you even,"" he says, half-jokingly. Pal is a construction worker in Calcutta, where he lives with his family of five, but his 13 roosters seem to be the real focus of his time and energy.Pointing to a brown one named Shah Rukh, he says, ""He was injured in the leg by his opponent's knife... but wouldn't let go until the latter fell.""True enough, the beautiful bird has a bandaged left leg, and his difficulty in walking is obvious. But that doesn't stop him from turning warrior, instantly, hackles and all, as Pal leads Rocky into his presence. ""He simply cannot tolerate any other male around him,"" Pal chuckles.GLADIATORS: (Above) Despite a broken leg, Shah Rukh (golden brown) rushes to combat Rocky (white). Picture Credit: Paromita KarFallacious physiological and cultural explanations, cry some. But, come winter, when the birds seem to don a stately glow, the perfectly waxed look so to speak, there is a rise in the incidence of this blood sport.""Makar Sankranti is of particular significance in rural Bengal, and village folk source entertainment in rooster fights. Melas and haats abound, and that is where the fights are staged,"" observes Jagannath Ghosh, who is like an encyclopaedia of people and customs in the forests and hinterlands of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Bhutan and Sikkim.Ghosh notes how enthusiasts start to buy and rear roosters much earlier, as a certain period of time is required to assess the bird's strength, training, grooming and so on. Only after that is the "" shnaada"" or male pheasant ready to be in the ring. ""Uddam, rokto, mrityu, ullas, akrosh... It is about vigour, blood thirst, thrill of the kill, exuberance and anger,"" is how he deconstructs the whole gamut.Wildlife conservationist Subhrojyoti Chatterjee, whose main area of study is hunting practices in the north and south Bengal regions, says that until five or six years ago, cockfighting was regularly held in the open in many places. ""Perhaps people have become more conscious now, both in terms of morality and litigation, but often this may not be the case in the districts or rural areas.""Local NGOs too have become vigilant, which in turn pushes police to conduct raids.Roosters have a bony leg spur, which humans supplement with an arsenal of metal spurs and small knives. ""The length of the knife is in proportion to the size of the leg,"" says Pradip Sardar, a pro since his teens.Pairing up takes place between two roosters of similar size, weight and height.""First, we try to get a measure of the bird's jeyd - doggedness or determination to grapple - by observing its kicking or how it beats its wings mid-air,"" says Sardar. Of all the gamecock varieties he has dealt with, Sardar's best bet is the shona-jhinjra - a bird with a cover of brown feathers and golden spots. But the one such bird he owned recently lost a fight, and he hasn't been able to buy another yet. He is also quite fond of his mala morog, the black one with light spots.What's colour got to do with it? ""Probably nothing, but I have noticed that the black ones tend to be more self-effacing,"" laughs Ghosh. He too gives the shona-jhinjra a high rating, for this bird is apparently able to learn the ropes of ""rana kaushal"" or warfare most efficiently. The Australian variety, weighing a good five kilos or more, and the Aseel - noted for its pugnacity - are other favourite players.Unlike the chicken we buy for consumption, these roosters cost a bomb. Ghosh says he has seen such birds being sold for as much as Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000. And that's nothing, compared to the prices in some districts down South, where cockfighting reportedly is a much-frenzied affair.Apart from the training, these birds are famously pampered. They need to be fed well - with corn, wheat, fish, rice and meat. Some keepers even indulge them with cashew, almonds and eggs for more strength.Vaccines, antibiotics, vitamins and supplements, Sardar knows it all - mox for colds, tetracycline for stomach infections, ampilox, terramycin and so on. ""If a bird suffers a gash, I sew it up with needle and thread. I am able to sense exactly what he needs, and within two or three weeks he is fit to fight again.""""It can be a terrible addiction, this rearing of fowl for fight,"" muses Ghosh. He recounts the story of a man who was left shattered after his shona-jhinjra fell dead. This, after months of preparation, during which time he was oblivious even to the needs of his wife and children.With punters and organisers keeping the stakes high, big money changing hands has become quite the norm. Wealthy enthusiasts betting cars and houses on roosters is also not unheard of. ""People are willing to bet upto Rs 1 lakh,"" says Pal, whose son has taken his best birds to the village to make the most of the festive season. ""These people are usually small-time businessmen, real estate promoters and their kin."" Money, however, is not always the objective - in many tribal areas, haandiya or country liquor is the prize for patrons.The spectators, of course all men, can be seen standing and shouting, gesturing and leaping - ""no place for a woman"", as they all say. The noise is deafening, and brawls common. In a bizarre incident a few years ago, a cock killed his master reportedly because the latter was forcing him into the ring immediately after his previous bout.The actual fight may last anything from less than a minute to over 30 minutes, until one of the two dies or is unable to fight any more. The knives are so sharp and dangerous that cockfighters themselves have been badly injured or killed when accidentally slashed by their own birds.And so it continues, this ancient blood sport, in the fringes of this great big city, at a distance enough for no one to lose so much of that humanity to be called savage, at a distance so safe that even the lawmakers can see and unsee."

Picture by Passang YolmoDarjeeling: The chairman of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration has been invited to attend the Bengal Global Business Summit, the first such gesture for a Darjeeling leader in an indication that the state government is trying to attract investors to the hills, too.""I, along with GTA vice-chairman Anit Thapa and GTA's principal secretary and other officials, have been invited to attend the business meet. This is a great opportunity for us to promote the hills. We have the potential to attract investors. We are also planning to hold investors' meet in Darjeeling in February,"" Tamang, who is the chairman of the board of administrators appointed by the Bengal government to run the GTA, said on Sunday.Even though the Mamata Banerjee government has been organising business meets for several years, this is the first time that a head of an autonomous set-up in the hills is being invited to address the gathering of investors.Tamang revealed the invitation to the media during his trip to the Singamari-Tukvar area, which has been the stronghold of Bimal Gurung, who heads the rival faction in the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, for nearly 20 years. He started the journey after sipping a cup of tea from a stall that is now housed in the closed office of the Morcha.""I haven't had tea here for a long time,"" Tamang said sipping tea standing on the Lebong Cart Road around 9.30am.The Morcha's central committee office has been sealed by the Darjeeling district administration on the ground that it was built on encroached land. The tea stall and three other business establishments have, however, been allowed to function from the building.After a steaming cup of tea, Tamang started his drive downhill; entering an area he had once frequented but not stepped in since May last year.People welcomed the Morcha leader at various places and he also stopped in front of Bimal Gurung's main office at Patlebas. Tamang met residents of Patlebas, where three houses had been burnt down during the recent statehood agitation.A few minutes before, Tamang had passed Gurung's residence. The main gate to Gurung's residence was locked, tied with the head of a goat, with some khadas, rice mixed with vermilion and flower petals and two puppets --- which all raised an eerie feeling.People had lined up at more than a dozen places with welcome gates made of plants and other materials and musical instruments. They also submitted memorandum with various demands to Tamang.Welcoming Tamang, Biren Rai, a Morcha leader from Tukvar second division, said: ""We had been part of various programmes since 2007 but not much development has taken place here. We do not know why.""In Singla, the crowd was heavy at many spots. A woman sought medical assistance to treat her fractured leg, while a resident of Shanti busty took Tamang to a spot requesting him to build a bridge that would connect Badamtam with the area.Tamang also visited the house of Pramil Subba, whose house had been gutted in the agitation.Tamang took a circuitous route, walking at many places, to reach Jamuni passing through Singla, Karmatar and Goke.""I am not here to prove anything. There is a precedent in the hills that once there is a change of guard, the area being represented by another person is neglected. I do not want this to happen,"" said Tamang, who stressed that he was visiting different GTA constituencies every Saturday and Sunday.""I had sanctioned a road project and drinking water scheme for Singla a few days back. Around Rs 50 crore has already been invested in Jamuni and you can see work is still continuing. I will not victimise this area,"" said Tamang.Gurung, as the GTA chief executive, had launched a major tourism project at Jamuni.Observers believe Tamang's visit is expected to send a strong message across the hills, as this constituency was known to be Gurung's den."
5b2e79a19855b72640115ddf,"Pak's jobless are fleeing, many end up dead",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/662125/paks-jobless-fleeing-many-end.html,2018-02-28,"The family, faces torn with grief, huddled around their phones, replaying voice messages sent from 3,000 miles away.""I can't talk too loudly or they'll take my phone away,"" said a panicked, hushed voice in one. ""Don't call me because it will make the ringer go off, they'll hear it and I'll get caught,"" it cautioned in another. And finally, ""Please tell the agent to send the money to Libya.""The voice in the messages was that of Babar Shabir, a 19-year-old Pakistani. His relatives fear he is dead, among roughly 90 people who drowned this month when a boat smuggling migrants from Libya to Italy capsized. A majority, including a newborn, appear to have been from Pakistan.The 16 bodies that have been found arrived in Pakistan earlier this month. Seven of the confirmed dead were, like Shabir, from tiny Gujrat, in northern Punjab province, which has been rocked by the disaster.Though Libya has become a notorious transit hub for illegal migration to Europe - some 1,80,000 migrants used that route to cross to Italy in 2016 alone - Pakistanis have in the past rarely been among them. But desperate Pakistanis will now go far in search of better lives.Shabir left his hometown, near Pakistan's border with India, with his 24-year-old cousin, Mazhar Hussain, in December. Their families say the pair collected around $13,000, a fortune for even the well-to-do, to pay a local smuggler who guaranteed safe passage to Europe. When news of the capsizing trickled back to Gujrat, the young men's families tried frantically, but unsuccessfully, to reach them.Azhar Hussain says he knew his brother Mazhar was dead when he saw a photo of his body posted on Facebook, circulated by Pakistanis in Libya to help confirm victims' identities. Azhar covered his face with his shawl as Shabir's older brother looked at the picture of Mazhar Hussain's greyish body, covered in sand. With Shabir's death not certain, the men remained glued to their phones, scouring gruesome photos for his face.Local labourers in this largely agrarian area have streamed overseas in sizable numbers since the 1970s. For years, legal migration was such a force that little towns here were given nicknames like Little Norway and Little Britain, for where their people had gone.Homes here hint at the mass migration. Tidy mud-brick village houses, surrounded by wheat and rice fields, have been increasingly replaced by mansions with gaudy ironwork and colourful tiles, built with money from overseas relatives. In 2014, almost 30% of local households reportedly received foreign remittances.The houses serve in a sense as billboards for smugglers, proof of money to be made abroad. Ansar Burney, a Pakistani civil rights activist who works to end people smuggling, said the message was persuasive. ""If I'm living in these rural towns, I'd be convinced I should go, too,"" he said.For Shabir, the appeal was hypnotic. ""We begged him not to go,"" his mother, Hamida Bibi, said between desperate prayers for her son. ""But he had made up his mind long ago.""His cousin, Mazhar Hussain, the oldest son in his family, also was drawn by the lure of fantastic wealth and hoped to send money home. ""Now, we're left with nothing,"" his brother Azhar said. ""We sold what land we had to collect money for his ticket to Europe. My parents are old, and I can't find steady work. It's like we lost everything when we lost him.""Legal migration from Pakistan peaked in 2015 when just under 1 million Pakistanis left to work overseas. It has since dropped almost by half, Burney said, with migrants seeking visas squeezed by concerns about terrorism in Europe and economic belt-tightening in the Persian Gulf.""The Saudis took an initiative to reduce all overseas labour, Pakistanis included,"" said Jabbar Chaudry of Pakistan's Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment, adding, ""The educated and semi-educated youth no longer have legal windows of opportunity.""An increasing number of Pakistanis, 14,000, applied for asylum in 2016 in Italy alone, most asserting persecution or fear of violence. Others fleeing in recent years included almost 7,000 ethnic Hazaras who gained asylum in Australia in 2013.With legal options for migrant workers shrinking, the Libyan route to Europe has become popular. According to the International Organization for Migration, in January about 240 Pakistanis crossed into Italy from Libya, making them the third largest nationality represented. By comparison, only nine were reported in January 2017.The cousins reached Libya by air and, according to their families, had legitimate visas. ""They took a flight from Lahore to Dubai, then Kuwait to Turkey, then they reached Libya,"" Azhar Hussain said. ""They would call us from a different airport every day for a few days.""Path of horrorsIn Libya, they joined the tens of thousands trying to reach Europe, and fell into the hands of smugglers demanding more money. Some of the men's last messages relayed the horror of being captive and beaten while others around them were tortured.Pressed for money, their families begged the smuggler in Gujrat to help and eventually came up with $1,000 more to secure the men's journey onward.This new path through Libya should get more scrutiny, said Mohsin Waheed Butt, an officer with the Pakistani Federal Intelligence Agency. ""Immigration officers, they need to inquire why people are going to Libya,"" he said. ""What kind of a person is going to Libya right now? It's obvious these guys are going for only one thing.""But Burney, the rights advocate, believes the government is on some level complicit, saying: ""These smugglers are flush with cash. They're getting Libyan visas in the dozens, and they've bought off the immigration officers sitting at the airport, too.""The director general of the Federal Intelligence Agency, Bashir Memon, confirmed that all the Pakistanis whose bodies were recovered after the capsizing had gone to Libya legally. He said law enforcement agencies ""try their best"" to counter ""a whole mafia of smuggling"" in the region.A short drive from where the cousins lived, Muhammad Khan held court recently in his ancestral house. Villagers came to offer condolences after learning his nephew died in the capsizing with his wife and children, the younger less than 2 months old.The nephew, Ismail Khan, moved his family to Libya two years ago, hoping to find work as a labourer. His uncle said he had not known the younger Khan wanted to go to Europe until after the family had died.The uncle said he emigrated to Britain legally 30 years ago, and had been back in Gujrat on vacation when he learned about the deaths. ""My family lives in Manchester now, and we have a good life,"" he said.Khan said he left Pakistan for the same reason his nephew Ismail did. ""When you live here, you lose hope,"" he said. ""You don't see hope for years on end. So, when someone presents you with an opportunity, a small window of hope, you'll risk it all."""

(Anirban Choudhury)Alipurduar: Police rescued the abducted wholesale rice merchant from a village on the border with Bangladesh in Cooch Behar on Sunday afternoon and arrested four alleged kidnappers.Swapan Das had been kidnapped from here on Wednesday while he was returning home on a bicycle, along with his friend Harekrishna Sarkar. A gang of six men had bundled Das into a white Maruti Omni and fled.The police had formed a team headed by Rajesh Yadav, the deputy inspector general of Jalpaiguri range, with Ajoy Prosad, the special superintendent of the CID, SPs of Alipurduar and Cooch Behar districts and Kuntal Banerjee, the subdivisional police officer of Dinhata, as members to trace the trader.Avaru Ravindranath, the SP of Alipurduar, said on Sunday: ""Our source were very active and we used all our resources. Alipurduar and Cooch Behar police jointly worked and the CID also helped us a lot trace the trader. We rescued Das from a hideout in Dinhata of Cooch Behar district, close to the Indo-Bangladesh border this afternoon. We have arrested four members of the gang, although two men are yet to netted. We will produce all the four in the additional chief judicial magistrate's court in Alipurduar on Monday and seek a prayer for their remand. We have recovered an improvised revolver, a cellphone and a live cartridge from the four.""The arrested men are Jiten Barman and Shyamal Barman from Dinhata and Sukumar Das and Jakir Hossain from Harinchora.According to another police officer, the kidnappers had covered Das's eyes with clothes and a gun was always pointed at his head.Asked if there was any militant link to the abduction, Ravindranath said details couldn't be disclosed for the sake of the investigation.According to police source, the kidnappers had demanded Rs 10 lakh as ransom.The police are yet to progress further in the probe into a letter sent to another trader in Alipurduar district.Within 48 hours of the abduction of Das, Nilkamal Adhikary of Jashordanga received a letter from an unknown outfit. He lodged a complaint with the police, saying the outfit has demanded Rs 2 lakh from him.Das who was present at the SP's press meet said he had no idea where he had been kept. ""During the abduction, the miscreants had beaten me up. But later, they never misbehaved with me. I am very much tired and want to take rest,"" said Das.Samir, the only son of Das, said: "" My father is back and we are relieved. We are grateful to police.""The police could rescue Das 48 hours before chief minister Mamata Banerjee attends a public meeting at Uttar Parokata in Samuktala, Alipurduar district."

5b2e79e99855b72640115ded,Aadhaar: India's big fix or big flub?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/655392/aadhaar-indias-big-fix-big.html,2018-01-23,"Aadhaar, India's grand programme to provide a unique 12-digit identification number to each of the country's 1.3 billion residents, appears to be collapsing under its own ambitions.When it was set up by the Congress-led UPA government in 2009, it was touted as a voluntary biometric ID system that would ensure the smooth delivery of public services - notably welfare benefits and subsidised food for the poor - while limiting the risk of fraud.The Bharatiya Janata Party, then the main opposition party, was among the project's fiercest critics at first, calling it too costly and a ""political gimmick."" But after it came to power, in May 2014, the BJP went further than the Congress had ever dreamed of: since then, it has made Aadhaar mandatory for accessing numerous public services, as well as for some private transactions.So far, Aadhaar - ""the foundation"" in Hindi - seems to have helped neither with welfare nor against corruption, all the while creating new problems, including by exposing people's personal data to theft or predation by the private sector.Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court began hearings in a long-running collective case challenging the programme's constitutionality. In their opening statement, the petitioners argued that Aadhaar, if fully implemented, would ""reduce citizens to servitude,"" since not having an Aadhaar number - that ""electronic leash"" - in effect meant ""civil death.""Failed systemOn the one hand, having an Aadhaar number does not in itself guarantee access to the country's welfare benefits - among the least generous in the world. On the other, the need to have one and to link it to one's various accounts and benefits has prevented some citizens from obtaining state assistance.Several states require people to enlist in Aadhaar before they can claim rice or wheat at subsidised prices under the Public Distribution System, an important source of food security in the country's poorer areas. Among them is Jharkhand, where only about 7% of residents aged 6 to 23 get an adequate diet.In September, an 11-year-old girl there died of hunger after her family was struck off the beneficiaries registry because it had failed to link its ration card to an Aadhaar number. (The government has contested this account, claiming the girl died of malaria.) A half-dozen other Indians are reported to have died because of similar reasons.These deaths are the starkest and most tragic example of the system's shortcomings. But many, many thousands of Indians, perhaps even millions, are at risk - if not of dying, at least of losing access to food, pensions or other benefits they sorely need. And all of this, precisely as a result of a system that was supposed to help them get state help.To buy subsidised grain in some states, for example, a beneficiary must authenticate her identity by placing the tip of a finger on a hand-held machine. Collecting a readable fingerprint this way requires functioning electricity, an internet connection and operational servers. In large swathes of rural India, such as in Rajasthan, all of this is a steep ask. Yet, if any one of these steps fails, applicants are denied food assistance.Previously, an infirm, older person could send a relative or neighbour with the relevant paperwork as a proxy to collect monthly rations. Now, the biometric identification system requires one's physical presence.In 2017, several economists and I conducted a survey of 900 households in Jharkhand, comparing villages that did and did not implement the Aadhaar system for buying grain. We discovered that the percentage of households that failed to obtain any grain at all was five times higher in the villages where Aadhaar authentication was compulsory (20%) than in those where it was not (4%).In theory, biometric identification could help reduce identity fraud, but there has never been much evidence of large-scale identity fraud in India's welfare programmes.The main problem with, say, the main food aid programme is that officials and intermediaries appear to misreport official disbursements and skim off some of the aid.In a survey of about 2,000 randomly selected households in eight states that the economist Jean Drze and I conducted in 2013, the households collected only 87% of their entitlements; the rest of the resources were misdirected.There is no evidence that Aadhaar has put a dent in corruption. In our 2017 survey, we found that among households that succeeded in buying grain, skimming levels were the same - about 7% - in villages with or without the Aadhaar system.Expanding presenceDespite these problems, Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government has expanded the reach of Aadhaar over the past year, requiring it for a host of public services beyond welfare benefits - such as to register marriages or file income tax returns.Worse, the government wants to make it compulsory to link bank accounts and mobile phone numbers to Aadhaar numbers. Online shopping portals have also started asking for the ID from people simply trying to buy a book or a pair of shoes.Some critics have warned that Aadhaar could turn into an instrument of mass surveillance. At a minimum, it already raises grave concerns about data security and privacy, neither of which is currently protected under Indian law. (The Supreme Court affirmed, in a landmark judgment, that privacy was a fundamental right under the Constitution last year.)The government has admitted that last year millions of Aadhaar numbers had been carelessly displayed on more than 200 government websites. Earlier this month, an investigative reporter for The Tribune newspaper claimed to have found a way to buy unrestricted access to the details of any Aadhaar number for just Rs 500, from people operating on WhatsApp.Given the many ways in which the Aadhaar system is broken, at the very least it should be made voluntary again, and the data of anyone who opts out should be destroyed.Aadhaar was supposed to showcase the government's forward thinking about efficient administration; it has only exposed the state's coerciveness. It was supposed to ease the poor's access to welfare; it has hurt the neediest. It was supposed to harness technology in the service of development; it has made people's personal data vulnerable.One of the government's biggest banner projects has become a glaring example of all that can go wrong with policy-making in this country."

None from the family or police confirmed the calls.Traders in Palashbari, Das's home, complained that though there was a police camp, only one to two cops are deployed. ""If there were adequate policemen, the abduction could have been averted,"" one trader said.Police and intelligence agencies suspect Das has most probably been taken to Assam, 60km from where he was kidnapped.On Thursday, intelligence officials had said Northeast-based insurgent groups could be behind the abduction.Now Adhikary's case has left Alipurduar businessmen worried. In his complaint filed on Friday, Adhikary has said that on December 31 evening, a person came to his house and handed over an envelope to his minor son.After he returned, he found it written on the letterhead of one ""United Santhal Peoples' Army"".

This made him file the complaint,"" said a source.Adhikary said over the phone: ""I initially thought it was a prank.

5b2e7c979855b72640115e74,When an injury turns fatal,http://www.deccanherald.com/edit/panorama/when-injury-turns-fatal-664897.html,2018-04-17,"In response to a damaged blood vessel, our body reacts immediately by clotting the wound and minimising blood loss. In the clotting process, blood platelets rush to the site and begin to produce chemicals which activate 13 different proteins  called clotting factors I to XIII  that bind in a complex mechanism. Fibrin, the final mesh forming protein, seals the clot.We take for granted this automatic reaction of the body. However, sometimes genetic mutations occur within the body which tampers with the clotting process leading to a depletion of some protein factors. As a result, the blood loses its ability to clot completely, causing excessive bleeding  even from a little cut.This rare condition is called Haemophilia. It is a type of bleeding disorder where the blood is deficient in factors VIII or IX. This genetically inherited defect, residing on the X chromosome, manifests as a disorder mostly in males, while females are carriers of the defective gene. They escape the affliction since they have another X chromosome to override the faulty one. The degree of deficiency varies from mild to moderate to severe, based on the level mutation in clotting factors.As a result, haemophilia assumes a deadly situation wherein a small wound can lead to profuse bleeding. A bump on the head can start internal bleeding which can turn out to be fatal if not attended immediately. Currently, this disorder is incurable and is only managed. The typical symptoms include excessive bleeding from any part of the body or long-term damage to joints by repeated episodes of bleeding. Medical history, blood test and clotting factor analysis are the usual diagnosing methods.According to a 2016 global survey, there are 3,00,000 known cases of haemophilia. However, lack of awareness of the disorder makes these figures obscure as thousands more go undiagnosed. According to an IJMR study of 2014, it is estimated that around 50,000 people in India could be haemophilic. The research also indicates that India lacks a national policy on the prevention and control of genetic diseases. Under such circumstances, awareness is the only resort and goes a long way in providing timely medical attention to the individual.Frank Schnabel started the World Federation of Hemophila (WFH) in 1963. Schnabel, a haemophilic himself, was keen to spread awareness, improve the treatment and care to haemophiliacs through his organisation. Soon, WFH established a global network of healthcare providers, set up organisations in different countries, and brought together haemophiliacs and their families. In 1969, acknowledging WFHs rigorous and noteworthy activities, WHO since then, is associating officially in their programmes.It is only apt that WFH declared April 17  Schnabels birthday  as World Haemophilia Day in 1989. This worldwide event sees workshops, and sensitisation camps held all over the world, where the public is informed about the disorder. WFH takes this opportunity to revive their commitment and reflect on the contributions of its members.Championing the cause of haemophilia in India was late Ashok Bahadur Verma, again a haemophilic, who started the Haemophilia Federation of India (HFI) in 1983. Through his relentless efforts, he spearheaded programmes to not only spread awareness and reach out to the affected community, but also draw the attention of the policymakers and make them aware of the nature of the criticality of the disorder.On Haemophilia Day 2015, the ministry of health and family welfare collaborated with FHI to participate in their workshops to spread awareness. The federations unrelenting efforts saw success in 2016 when the Central Board of Excise and Customs withdrew the customs duty levied on the import of the drug  Anti-Haemophilic Factor concentrate (VIII and IX). HFI caters to the welfare and needs of people with haemophilia, through 76 chapters across four zones. They aim to locate undiagnosed people with haemophilia, spread awareness, educate the afflicted and their families and provide medical care at optimal cost.Currently, coagulation factor replacement therapy by blood infusion is the primary way to control haemophilia. However, the option comes with certain difficulties: one, this requires a regular treatment; two, it is an expensive treatment as India lacks drug manufacturers for such rare genetic diseases; and three, some individuals may react to therapy by developing inhibitors to the infusion.At such times, the help of support groups is invaluable while preventive methods and immediate attention go a long way as a parallel approach. Safer choice of activities and training in RICE first aid technique  Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation  is the key to manage the condition."
5b2e7d389855b72640115e9c,"Farm price, market assurance will bloat fiscal deficit",http://www.deccanherald.com/edit/panorama/farm-price-market-assurance-will-bloat-fiscal-deficit-665363.html,2018-04-18,"Stung by depressed price-realisation by farmers, much below the minimum support price (MSP), and with impending general elections next year, the Narendra Modi government announced in the Union Budget for 2018-19 that henceforth, they will be assured MSP which is at least 1.5 times the cost of production.Mere assurance of a remunerative price is of no use unless the farmer is able to sell his entire produce at this price. Keen to ensure that this happens, the government asked NITI Aayog to come up with suggestions. The latter prescribed three alternatives, namely: market assurance scheme (MAS) or price deficiency payments or incentives to private sector to buy farmers produce at MSP.Under MAS, agencies of the state buy the produce directly from farmers at MSP. Under the second option, the government does not buy, but instead it reimburses the shortfall in price realised from sale (albeit in the mandi) vis--vis the MSP. Under the third alternative, the private sector is incentivised to buy at MSP.In the follow through, a group of ministers (GoM) under Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has approved nationwide implementation of MAS covering 23 agricultural crops, including wheat and rice. The scheme will cover up to 40% of the marketable surplus and cap the price loss (difference between farm harvest prices and MSP) to be eligible for compensation at 25% of MSP.The Union government, apart from absorbing procurement cost in full (roughly 15% of MSP), will bear 100% of the price loss up to 20% of the MSP and half the price loss between 20% and 25% of MSP. The states will share only half of the shortfall between 20% and 25%. Of the overall cost of the scheme, the Centres share would be 93.75% and the states will contribute 6.25%. The states will have to pay for any additional support they wish to give farmers.Though bandied about as a revolutionary step in the overarching mission of doubling farmers income, the expected outcome is doubtful even as the scheme holds dangerous portends for both the Union government and the states via increasing their respective subsidy bills.During 2017-18, the total payment on food subsidy under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) was Rs 1,40,000 crore, including Rs 1,15,000 crore towards excess of procurement price over the heavily subsidised issue price of wheat, rice and coarse cereals (Rs 1/2/3 per kg respectively) for sale through the public distribution system (PDS) and Rs 25,000 crore as incidental cost on storage and handling. Additionally, the government spent Rs 35,000 crore on the price support scheme for pulses and oilseeds, taking the total to Rs 1,75,000 crore.As for 2018-19, according to NITI Aayog, the total cost of MAS is estimated to be about Rs 1,11,000 crore. Of this, the Centre will bear about Rs 1,05,000 crore. Together with Rs 1,15,000 crore being the subsidy to cover the excess of procurement price over issue price under NFSA (same as last year), the total outgo would be Rs 2,20,000 crore. This is an increase of Rs 45,000 crore over the corresponding amount spent during 2017-18. Against the budget allocation of Rs 1,69,000 crore for 2018-19, this is higher by Rs 51,000 crore and will have a destabilising effect on the fiscal deficit.One wonders whether central agencies such as the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state institutions have the infrastructure and wherewithal to carry out procurement operations on the scale contemplated under the scheme. The experience with similar schemes run in the past for specific crops, such as pulses, oilseeds, vegetables (onion, tomato, etc) scale does not instil confidence. That apart, with the compensation capped at 25% of MSP, besides limiting purchase to 40% of the marketable surplus would still leave farmers dissatisfied.Furthermore, has the government thought through the fate of millions of subsistence farmers who do not have a marketable surplus (they produce food primarily for self-consumption) and a vast number of landless workers who depend entirely on the PDS or market? While they have nothing to gain from the price support scheme, they will be hit by the inflation triggered by it; all the more when the quota for subsidised supply under NFSA, namely five kilos per person per month, is far from being adequate in relation to the need.The responsibility for disposal of the stocks purchased from farmers lies entirely with the states. In order that the state does not suffer a loss on its sale, it should at least realise the effective purchase price (MSP minus price loss support) plus the carrying cost. If it does not  the most likely scenario  then it could suffer loss. This would be in addition to their 6.25% share under the scheme and would be seriously destabilising on the overall finances of the state.The scheme is hugely negative for the finances of the Centre and the states besides for subsistence farmers and landless workers, even as the intended impact (albeit positive) on farmers offering marketable surplus will be seriously constrained by the weaknesses in state procurement, handling and distribution machinery.Policy reforms neededThere is an inherent flaw in the approach. The government is looking for an administrative solution to a problem that requires policy reforms. If the farmers are not getting a good price, it is because the markets for agri-produce are monopolised by intermediaries (in many cases, politicians or their relatives) licensed by state authorities to buy their stuff in designated mandis/market platforms.Even as the consumer pays a high price, the intermediaries/traders pass on only a fraction of it to the farmers. The solution lies in liberating the agri-markets from state controls and giving farmers more options to sell their produce. This can happen only if states bring about legislative reforms such as the abolition of the APMCs (agricultural produce marketing committees). Given that a majority of states are under BJP rule today, it should not be difficult for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to crack the whip.(The writer is a New Delhi-based policy analyst)"
5b2e92529855b72640116325,Tobacco: Ban this agent of death,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/668728/tobacco-ban-agent-death.html,2018-04-15,"""For he on honey-dew hath fed, and drunk the milk of Paradise"" sang an 18th century poet who composed his masterpiece after experiencing a strange hallucination under the influence of opium. His poem, which remained unfinished when a visitor disturbed his ""vision"", is a typical example of addiction. Today's addicts may end up with diseases, instead of leaving great poetry for posterity. Blowing smoke rings into the air resulted in literary masterpieces in the case of TP Kailasam. In others, it may only result in a heart attack or, worse, deadly lung cancer. With its cocktail of chemicals, including arsenic, tobacco is the most addictive of all addictions, ruining families and societies. Smoked, inhaled, chewed, sniffed or dipped, it is the gateway to disease and death. It has been described by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as ""the single, greatest preventable cause of death.""It is, therefore, highly commendable that the Consortium for Tobacco-Free Karnataka has urged political parties in the state to include tobacco control measures in their election manifestoes. Dr Vishal Rao, a cancer surgeon and member of the consortium, has rightly said ""your simple action can save more lives which even a doctor cannot do.""If other states followed similar campaigns, tobacco-related ailments may considerably reduce. When we are willing to use 25% of precious land in the country for the cultivation of this weed -- land that could be used to grow more food - we have not progressed from colonial times when tea and tobacco took precedence in agriculture over life-giving rice and millets. Recent studies shockingly reveal that tobacco products are cheaper in India than food items. Besides, the same starving children are exposed to the hazards of tobacco from a young age when they are made to work long hours on tobacco farms. Their contact with nicotine when they handle wet leaves make them potential victims of various forms of cancer. These are ills that governments can prevent, but don't.The reason is not far to seek. Independent India has much to gain from rich tobacco companies. The British left our shores 70 years ago. But the ""imperial"" hand-rolled cigar culture still haunts us. What an irony that while the use of tobacco has declined considerably in developed countries, they are rising in significant numbers in India and other developing ones. This is not surprising when governments pamper corporate houses like ITC which, even today, sells more than 80% of the cigarettes smoked in India. What's more, it has been granted permission to do online sales now, targeting the younger generation. This exposes the government's false concern to save them from the hazards of smoking.What the central government has failed to realise is the tremendous economic harm that tobacco consumption will do to the country. Pulmonary and cardiac diseases, strokes and various forms of cancer not only kill and debilitate individuals, they ruin families, drive them to abject poverty, besides creating an entire population of sick citizens who contribute nothing but, on the other hand, drain public resources like medicines, hospitals and public healthcare facilities. Realising this, developed countries have spared no measure to fight the war against tobacco. They have adopted the most effective measures, like raising taxes on its production and sale. Whereas in India, even the slightest increase in taxes raises a hue and cry among the producers and users of the killer weed. Raising taxes against their ""legal cigarettes"" will encourage smuggling and the import of foreign brands, argue cigarette companies. Their strange logic that Indian brands will consequently get killed reveals a mindset that is oblivious to public health concerns.In this context, the Bill Gates Foundation recommendation, supported by WHO, is worth a thought: ""If India increases its tax on bidis from 9% to 40% per 1,000 sticks (this country has more beedi users than cigarette smokers), and on cigarettes from Rs 659 to Rs 3,691 per 1,000 sticks, 18 million lives will be saved.""18 million lives! Which means that tobacco corporates, their suppliers, distributors, retailers and promoters have blood on their hands. If the central and state governments in this country do not heed such warnings, it only gives the lie to all other measures they profess to adopt to curb the use of tobacco and which have obviously failed.The WHO Convention on Tobacco Control was a great achievement. But, as it has rightly pointed out, ""without significant tobacco taxation, cigarettes will remain affordable to the world's billion-plus smokers,"" thus reversing the progress made on all other fronts.If the central and state governments truly wish to eradicate this scourge which ruins and destroys lives, they should walk their talk about eradicating the tobacco habit among future generations at least."
