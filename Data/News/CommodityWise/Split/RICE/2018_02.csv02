A few stalls are already up. Picture by Mayukh SenguptaIf you are looking to do something new on Sundays, you can soon head to Nalban to shop and eat, while strolling along the beautiful bheri.Come July and the State Fisheries Development Corporation (SFDC) would be throwing open a kind of a Sunday haat. Haat boshechheRabibare Nalbaner joler dharey, is what managing director of SFDC Soumyajit Das calls it. We want to create an ambience for people to come and enjoy themselves in. The opening is tentatively slated for the first weekend of July, he adds.The haat would happen from 4pm to 7pm at the Bhuri Bhoj Maath. This is the field beside the paid parking lot run by SFDC near the Nalban food park. It is roughly opposite the McDonalds restaurant in Sector V.The haat will have shops, stalls and restaurants, some of which are up and a few that will come up soon. The Haringhata shop sells poultry and meat products; Machhli Baba sells fish; Sufal Bangla, a government-run initiative, would sell vegetables, fruits and organic rice and spices. Restaurants like Murighonto and Kaviar have opened to serve foodies too.We shall shortly open Mishti Bangla too, said Das. This shop will stock  not just rosogolla and sandesh but also  renowned delicacies from across the state. There will be Burdwans Sitabhog, Saktigarhs Lyangcha, Krishnanagars Shorbhaja and Shorpuria and Ranaghats Pantua.They are also getting self-help groups to come and sell handicraft items and talks are on to get some bauls to perform too. That would set the mood and we are confident that it will have takers, said Das.Regulars to Sector V are upbeat. Nalban Food Park is near the bus stand where I board my bus from. Ive been buying meat products from the Haringhata stall there for two months now and a haat will add many more options, said Debabrata Shome, a Sector V employee."

Metro spoke to some such studentsOdds and beginningsAjizul Halder prepared for the exams in between collecting paddy and making rice.The student of Krishnachandrapur High School in South 24-Parganas notched up 81.6 per cent.Ajizul had scored 83 per cent in Madhyamik but his father, a van rickshaw-puller, wanted him to quit studies as he could not afford to pay for his son's education.Determined not to give up, the boy took up odd jobs instead. ""Had I quit studies, I would have been working as a labourer,"" Ajizul said.At home, he had the responsibility of buying paddy from the market and making rice - a tedious process. ""Fifty-six kg paddy gives about 38kg rice. The paddy is boiled in water, soaked and dried in the sun for two days. We take it to a nearby village to remove the husk before selling in the market,"" Ajizul said. The family's total earning is around Rs 6,000 per month.Ajizul would complete his chores before sitting down with books. He scored 90 in Bengali and 87 in English and bioscience. Headmaster Chandan Kumar Maiti has always been encouraging. ""Ajizul is a good debater too, with great clarity of thought,"" he said.Golden girlRanibala Hazra has been a zari worker since Class V to raise money for private tuitions. Her efforts bore fruit when she scored 88.7 per cent in HS and topped her school, Nayachak Jadunath High School in Sankrail, Howrah.Every order fetches Ranibala around Rs 500 to 700, which she spent on tuitions from three teachers. ""My father is a farm labourer. My mother helps him. They earn less than Rs 4,000 a month. I tried to support them,"" Ranibala said.Ranibala wants to study geography, in which she scored 95, but is worried about the ""costly books"". ""If not, I will settle for education."""

Returns to office for lunch and paperwork in the eveningsSeen in: New TownHeat story: Ive been in this field for 22 years but in New Town I face a unique challenge: there are hardly any shady trees here for traffic policemen to seek refuge under. But things are getting better.For instance, there was no shade at the Shrachi More near City Centre 2 last year but this year a Metro viaduct has being built overhead and provides some shade. The Kolkata Gate comes to our rescue too.We have about 100 civic volunteers in New Town and send them water, glucose and ORS round the clock. We also ask them to take turns and not stand in the sun for more than 20 minutes at a go.Ive also seen numerous pedestrians get heat strokes. Just the other day, we rushed one such man to Ohio Hospital.I travel by bike and tie a wet handkerchief around my face. Still I get blisters on my skin and wrists due to the heat. But this is our duty and without us there would be accidents and congestions and so we grin and take the heat in our stride.Auto driver Bijoy Kumar Saha wipes off sweat before leaving BaisakhiBIJOY KUMAR SAHAOccupation: Autorickshaw driverOn the streets from: 8am to 7pmSeen around: Baisakhi auto standHeat story: The other day one of the drivers in our stand fainted. We rushed him to the sub-divisional hospital and learnt he had suffered a sun stroke. But then this is nothing new for us. Our stand has 22 autos but three or four of us are absent daily as they get sick in the heat.An NGO has built a water cooler at Baisakhi and we fill our bottles from there, wrap them in cloth and ferry them around with us. I also carry a towel  hankies are not enough  to soak in water and wipe the sweat off.I used to get rice for tiffin but these days it would go bad before lunchtime. So I bring roti but tarkari doesnt last. Then I eat the roti by itself or have it with a banana or laddoo. People say its good to drink sugarcane juice this season but I cant afford it often.Despite the heat, we try to report for work as we have to earn a living and also because passengers depend on us.Delivery boy Sudarshan Mondal packs food from a New Town jointSUDARSHAN MONDALOccupation: Delivery boy of an app-based food ordering and delivery companyOn the streets from: Noon to 11pmSeen around: New TownHeat story: When we brave the heat and reach air-conditioned restaurants to pick up food, chances are that the managament wont allow us to sit inside if they have customers. But some, like Dawat near New Town police station, give us respect and let us in.If we feel sick on the go we have to buy cold water for ourselves. To date, no house I have delivered food to has offered me water. They are only obsessed with ensuring I dont leave without returning every penny of change.Our uniform comprises a synthetic black T-shirt thats so suffocating that it has given us heat rashes. Weve asked our company to change the uniform in summers. Ive also bought a skin guard for my arms as they burn under the sun as we ride.Labourer Tapas Roy (right) fixes underground cables next to CD Block.

Then again, on Monday a lady in DB Block felt sorry seeing me dripping in sweat and wanted to give me water. But it was I who had to decline. We have so many deliveries to make that I had no time for a sip.We have 20 delivery boys who like me, cycle around Salt Lake and Sector V, or ride bikes to up to Science City and Sealdah.

They ferry hundreds of domestic help, ayahs and vendors from suburban Bengal to CalcuttaA bleary-eyed Amina Bibi boards the train from Ghutiari Sharif at 4.28am. She is with her husband. The couple get off at Sealdah, pick up vegetables from the wholesale market there and head for their stall in north Calcutta. This has been their routine for three decades nowSome stories must begin from the end. The story of the up train from Canning would have made little sense, had we not caught the down train first. We start our journey from Bagha Jatin station in Calcutta one late afternoon in April.Platform No. 2 looks like the handiwork of some whimsical gardener. A colour patch blooming here, a colour patch there. Those would be the women from the suburbs who come to the city every day to earn a living. They are returning home now.The sun is in a mood. The blowing breeze feels like a warm compress. But these women are laughing, talking. Each of them clutches a cloth or nylon bag, occasionally pulls out PET bottles from these and glugs down water, splashes some on the face and then wrapping a portion of the sari tightly over the head, lapses into conversation again.Someone is abusing a ""useless"" husband. Someone else has lost her job that day. ""I begged them not to terminate my services before Pujas but they ignored me,"" she says. She is now spreading the word among the sisterhood to avoid this particular household. In the absence of a union to safeguard their interests, this is how they avenge wrongs. Another person is praising her employers - good money, a printed sari, fish for lunch every day. ""Sounds too good to be true,"" shoots back another. Her name is Mithu. She adds, ""I work in three houses. No one gives me anything to eat. I feel like having something now, but my little girl has fever and I have to get her a fruit or two...""It is 3.28am. Salekha Purkait is sitting in the ladies compartment by herself. She too is a vegetable vendor. Her stall is a spot on the footpath adjacent to east Calcuttas Topsia Market. She makes Rs 200 to Rs 300 daily. And pays a weekly levy of Rs 40 for her spotUsharani is in her mid fifties. Works as a cook in two households. When she was younger she worked in 7-8 households a day. Her husband, Subhash Biswas, used to work as a mason till he was struck by a liver ailment. The two have saved up enough to buy a small plot of land in PialiShe eyes the muri ghugni - puffed rice mixed with a spicy preparation of grams - and boiled eggs that a vendor is selling.It is 3.10pm. The train pulls into the platform and there is a terrible rush. The next train comes almost an hour later.Swati Poile, a young woman with bright eyes and a good-natured smile, is our guide. She shoves us into the compartment, and introduces us to the regulars.Usharani Biswas is our self-appointed guardian. ""Not there. Stand here,"" she orders. ""It is less hot here."" She talks about the elderly couple she cooks for. The man is bedridden. ""I would have quit, except that I worry how those two will manage then."" Someone applies a balm and a pungent smell fills the compartment.The train trundles into Piali. The women fan out in different directions. Some swoop down on the fish stalls on the tracks. Before she joins a frail man with a cycle, Usharani hollers an invitation. We nod and follow Swati.Swati Poile works as a domestic help in four households. She is from Piali, four stops from Canning station, where she lives in a house made of dorma (cane) with a tin roof. She leaves home at 5am every day and returns early evening. Her only relaxation upon return is to feed the hens. Here she is holding clay models she has made for her sons school projectUsharani collects firewood from the housing complexes where she works and uses these to fire her little kitchen at the end of the day. This day she has cooked eggs in coconut milk for dinner, to be had with steaming riceWhen the train pulls into the city, the women gain momentum. Stumble out of the station, start to rush. Most of them walk 1.5 to 2 kilometres to get to work. And once they have assumed their professional roles, the city stirs awake. Calcuttas day beginsSwati has been working as a domestic help these 12 years. ""At first people used to say I have gone astray,"" she says. Her husband used to paint multistorey apartments, but after he saw a colleague fall to death, he never went back to work. Swati's home is spic and span. The stacked utensils gleam. Her husband is unbudging, watches TV. The mother-in-law is making faux garlands. Every 12 bundles of a dozen garlands each fetch Rs 30.The women make tea, serve out snacks, clean up the house, do the dishes, prepare dinner. We meet Mamoni Mondal who has joined the workforce recently. She has a loan to pay off. Swati's neighbour, Sabita Baidya, works as an ayah. She started working after her husband abandoned her.Swati goes to bed at 1am, wakes up at 3am. Usharani goes to bed earlier but she too leaves home around then.When we get to Canning station at 3.30 the next day, the train is already there. Some women are sleeping inside it. The locomotive jolts to life. We cross Taldi, Betbaria. At Ghutiari Sharif, a huge crowd boards. By the time we leave Piali, it is more than full. People clinging to each other, squatting on the floor. The younger women with earphones plugged, pretending not to hear pleas to make room. Others carrying crabs in cane baskets.No sooner the train pulls into Jadabpur than the women leap out. The speed, the collective hum, the urgency - you would think a broken hive and not a train stopped here, pouring out swarms of bees. Hitching up their saris they break into a run."

People are used to patishapta as a dessert but here it is a starter, explains chef Tapas Bala. We chop the prawn, saute and mix it with mashed potatoes before rolling it as patishapta.Ghoti delicacies include Dal Raibahadur and Ghoti murgi while bangal ones include Chitol Kalia and Sorshe Roopchada. Even dishes like shuko will be given a Bangal tinge. Their version is less bitter, more spicy and more dry than the ones people here are used to, says general manager Sumanta Maity.Pocket pinch: Rs 999Restospeak: Our hotel is nearly two years old and our peak season is from October to February. But we had robust footfall last Poila Baisakh, says Maity. Also, we realised that people came the day after too. So this time we are hosting a three-day festival.Where: Cafe Studio, IA BlockWhen: April 14 to 30What: Italian food with a Bengali twist. So while Spinach Tortellini, a ring-shaped pasta, uses mascarpone cheese sauce, its base is the ever-familiar lal shak with panch phoron. Fish gets prominence in any Bengali festival so we have items like Fish Pie and Fish Ravioli, which is smoked bekti in tangy tomato and kasundi sauce, says head chef Debasish Paul.But the star dish is the Grilled Baby Bhetki, thats seasoned, pan friend, topped with nichoise sauce and placed on a bed of pesto pearl barley risotto. This dish is for mach-bhat lovers. But we since we replace the rice with barley and go easy on the spices, its healthier, says the chef.Pocket pinch: Spinach Tortellini is Rs 236, Grilled Baby Bhetki Rs 394Restospeak: Tastes are changing these days and so we think diners would like to try new options this festive season, said one of the owners Sarika Agarwal.A sweet platter at Fern Residency. (Sudeshna Banerjee)The Fern ResidencyWhere: The StadelWhen: April 15What: The hotels First Innings restaurant will be a serving sumptuous lunch and dinner buffet spread. There will be starters like Mochar Chop and Murshidabadi Murgi and main course items like Kakra Jhal, Chingri Malai Curry and Kochi Pathar Mangsho. Dont miss the Baked Rosogolla and Malpua Rabri for dessert.Pocket pinch: Rs 1,260Where: De Sovrani, DD BlockWhen: April 14 -15What: Rajakiya Paat, the Nava Varsha platter with 25 itemsPocket pinch: Rs 1250What: Poila Bhoj, a buffet of 33 itemsPocket pinch: Rs 1075What: Sand, the restaurant at the D.C. Paul group hotel, is known for fusion food. But for Nava Varsha, they are sticking to the traditional cookbook.The buffet will be a mix of east Bengal and west Bengal items. The east-west balance is there in every course. With Dhonepatar Bora there is Dimer Devil among the alternatives in the starters, with Murighonto-Bhaat there is Mishti Pulao, with Kharkolbata there is Lalshaak, with Phulkopir Rosa there is Dhokar Dalna and with Jirebata diye Shukto there is Jamidarbarir Shukto. The former has just cumin seed phoron. The latter requires addition of cream and is sweet, explains executive chef Kaushik Dhar. The a la carte menu is all West Bengal. Both includes a drink on the house.Restospeak: We are a young team and we want to make you feel proud to be a Bengali while tasting our food, said Kamalini Paul, director.The SojournA dish at Cafe StudioThe StadelWhere: The Sojourn, KB BlockWhen: April 15What: The Baisakhi Mahabhoj buffet will present a melange of epar and opar Bangla. Sous chef Sekhar Biswas has prepared innovative items like Nabadiganta Morich Murgi, a chicken preparation involving marination with milk and poppyseed paste and cooked on slow fire. That is one of the eight non-vegetarian dishes on offer, including hilsa, pabda, bekti and prawn dishes. While at lunchtime there is only the buffet, for dinner, there is both buffet and the a la carte menu to order.Pocket pinch: Rs 945 (buffet)Restospeak: We have tried to innovate with small details like cook shukto with laudnata instead of the usual sojnednata. That provides a difference in taste, said the sous chef.Where: The Fern Residency, New TownWhen: April 14-15What: The hotel has placed equal emphasis on veg and non-veg options. There will be variations in the menu on the two days. If there is Tel Koi on Saturday there will be Pabdar Jhal on Sunday. Echor Chingri will be replaced by Potol Chingri the next.There will also be a concise set menu for vegetarians with round the year offerings.Pocket pinch: Rs 996Kurry n KebabNot just Bengal, April 15 marks New Year day in Kerala too. So if you feel like exploring how the occasion is celebrated in gods own country, head to the Vishu food festival at GD Blocks Kurry n Kebab.Onam and Vishu are the most important festivals of the state, says Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab. And food is an important part of it. So expect a thali, served on banana leaf, with more than 20 dishes.The staff will be staying over at the restaurant the previous night, in preparation. At 4am we shall bathe, don new dhoti-kurtas, pray and then cook, smiles K. Surendran Nair, the sweet 72-year-old Malayali head chef.Any auspicious occasion in Kerala is strictly vegetarian but you wont miss mutton as you dig into Aviyal (made of papaya, chal kumro, and coconut), Kootu Curry (made of channa, kachkolka, ol and carrots) and Pachadi (a tangy mixed vegetable curry).Since the meal is served on a banana leaf, most items are dry or have a thick gravy. Its just sambar, rassam and a Moong Dal preparation that are watery and will be served on the rice. The chef adds that the Moong Dal preparation is one of the toughest on his list. It uses jaggery and coconut milk and takes two hours to make, he says.Menons personal favourite is the tangy Mambazha mango curry, made of curd, coconut and chilli.The Rs 400 thali will be a lunch-only affair, as is the custom in the southern state, and prior reservations is a must. This part of town has many Malayalis working in the IT sector or studying in institutes like NUJS. They have been making bookings but for Onam we had more Bengalis. Lets see what happens this time, smiles Menon."

Primarily, it appears to be a case of poisoning. The couple might have taken some poison with their dinner,"" an officer of the Belghoria police station said. ""We will send the viscera for tests.""The Neogys lived in Rajendra Lal Ganguly Lane in the Charu Market area.""They had checked in using their voter identity cards around 8.30pm on Friday,"" Nikunja Bihari Nandy, the lodge owner, told Metro. ""They had vegetables and rice for dinner and retired early.""A team of officers from Belghoria police station sent the bodies to Sagore Dutta hospital for post-mortem and seized the plates, glasses and spoons that were on the table apart from the couple's bag.The couple's son has apparently told cops that his parents used to take sleeping pills.The family didn't file any complaint till late on Saturday."

The rectangular board atop the entrance has ""Salehjee Musafirkhana"" written in three different languages - English, Bengali and Urdu - one out of compulsion, one for necessity and the last for the sake of tradition.The literal translation of musafirkhana would be travellers' lodge, guesthouse, hostelry, inn... And yet it is not. It is not just about the checking in and the checking out. It is not just a stopover; it is a hyphen connecting journeys. Musafirkhana is redolent with the joy of diverse and disparate peregrinations.The three-storey building has pillars with a dark grey chevron pattern resembling a regular heartbeat. The floors are red oxide, smooth and cool to touch. The louvered sunshades, only half covering the balcony on each floor, are wood in faded turquoise. The railings, couplets in iron, flirt with the sunlight, their effect khwabeeda or dreamy. Breaking all subdued tones are bursts of red and yellow on the clothesline on the topmost floor.It is 5 in the evening. The doors of the common room on the first floor are a soothing bottle green and ajar, not unlike the people inside. These men must have just arrived from some place, dead tired. Their luggage lies hither thither, much like themselves, splayed on mats in deep slumber. The soft evening light streams in through arched stained glass windows - green, red and yellow - missing a pane or two in places.The musafirkhana was established in 1889 by Ebrahim Sulaiman Salehjee and Musaji Ahmed Salehjee of the Sunni Bohra community who had come to Calcutta from Surat's Kathor village. Musaji's great-grandson Mohammed Ibrahim Ameen Salehjee, the present secretary of the place, tells The Telegraph, ""We were billionaires at that time and had shifted here seeking to expand the business. But my great-grandfather wanted to create something people would remember him by. That is why he built this place."" He adds, ""In those days, there were no other hotels or lodges not only in this area but in all of Calcutta.""Salehjee shows an old photograph of the place, from 1947. He says, ""This picture was taken during the Bengal riots. Many Muslims from all over the city took refuge here.""For the first 100 years, the musafirkhana would not charge even one paisa from anyone. Thereafter, a nominal fee was levied.The place has 70-plus rooms and can accommodate as many as 1,500 guests. But even that is not enough during Haj season. Says Salehjee, ""Despite the government arranging accommodation for the pilgrims, those from the poorer sections prefer staying here. In fact, there have been times when we have had to put up a tent on the terrace to provide lodging. We don't refuse Haj pilgrims and during the season, we do not allow anybody else to stay.""Abdul Salam from Bareilly is here on a business trip. He is staying on the first floor, which is where all the single men check in. In the room adjoining his are four people, all from different parts of Uttar Pradesh. One of them, Khurshid Alam, tells us, "" Yahaan pe sab log apne jaise lagte hain. Hotel mein jaayenge toh ek hi room mein akele rehna padega. Yahaan par naye logo se milna ho jaata hai, baat cheet ho jaati hai."" He is basically recommending the familial ambience of the musafirkhana, the wealth of interactions that cannot be accrued from a sanitised stay in some hotel room.Some renovation work is going on on the second floor. Apart from the common room, most of it is empty. On the staircase leading to the floor above, there is a board that reads: Gair mard ko upar jana mana hai. It is the only floor that has family rooms. The notice written in English is not as nuanced: Do not go upstairs. This is the liveliest and most colourful floor of all. Children run about playing catch-catch as their mothers comb their hair, put out clothes to dry, all the while exchanging pleasantries, swapping tales. A family of seven from Malda busily tucks into a meal of rice and dal. The little ones eat puffed rice heaped on a newspaper spread on the floor. They are here to get their visas for Bangladesh.

Pictures by Shubham PaulSouth Indian food is just idli and dosa. All South Indian food is vegetarian. All South Indian food is cooked in coconut oil. Kurry n Kebab, a cosy restaurant next to GD Market, claims to bust these myths with their Kerala food festival from February 26 to March 4.Idli and dosa are only snacks. For main course we have enough fish and mutton dishes to make Bengalis ask for more, promises Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab.But the owners were sceptical about introducing Kerala fare in Salt Lake and so decided to keep the tried-and-tested Mughlai cuisine on their menu too  hence the word kebab on their name.Nonetheless the upcoming festival focuses only on Kerala food, that you probably have not tasted before.Unniappam for dessert (top), (above) butter milk for startersKerala Mutton Ishtu (Rs 295), a mild, coconut milk-based stew, is unmissable. Chicken lovers can try the spicy Chicken Chettinad (Rs 280). Strictly speaking, Chettinad is a region in Tamil Nadu but it borders Kerala so were taking liberties. It goes very well with Malabari Paratha, says Menon.As an accompaniment, its the appam that is unique in look, taste and texture. The white round staple is soft and fluffy in the centre but has a crispy skirt on the edges. A dosa batter is made of rice and lentil but appam uses only rice. It uses no oil and is cooked on a kadai, which gives it the wholesome shape.Fish lovers must try Aiyla Fry (mackerel) or Naimeen Pollichada (Rs 260), a grill-cum-paturi take on the Surmai fish. Bengalis are partial towards river fish but sea fish like Surmai are very popular in Kerala, says Menon, adding that its not easy to procure the fish. You dont get it in Salt Lake. We have to fetch it from Park Circus, says the resident of New Towns Eastern High.While south Indian food is usually cooked in coconut oil, the Calcutta crowd would not enjoy it, says K. Surendran Nair, the head chef with over 30 years of experience. So were using refined oil. Coconut oil is used rarely, only in dishes such as Potato Stew.As for dessert, try the southern take on payesh or a rice-jaggery-banana fried item called Unniappam (Rs 150). The pellets are served hot over a bed of cold rabri, which is a twist we have added, says the chef.Kerala Mutton IshtuIngredients (serves one) Mutton with bone 500g (5 pieces) Potato half Coconut milk 100ml Green chilli 2 Ginger 5g Onion 100g Cloves, cardamom and cinnamon- total 5g Curry leaves 2gMethodBoil the mutton in a pressure cooker.

(Sudeshna Banerjee)He teaches anatomy to medical students at the University of Tokyo. The rest of the time, when he is not busy researching the journey of organelles in human cells, he writes poetry in Japanese.Yosuke Tanaka was a guest at the just-concluded New Town Book Fair. My family name Tanaka means centre of the rice field, smiled the 48-year-old cell biologist, lunching on noodles after the inauguration of the fair.In Japan, traditional poetry is haiku or tanka, which are both fixed form. But contemporary poets like Tanaka prefer to write gendai-shi, which is free flowing.He is also one of the few poets in Japan who studies and judges the musicality of poems. Japanese is a musical language. So the pitch of the tone is very important. If the word hashi is uttered in a rising tone, with the second syllable being in a higher pitch, the word means edge. If the tone is falling, the word means chopsticks.Tanaka uses a trinary system of figures to describe the pitch structure of a poem. So, 1 stands for low pitch, 2 for intermediate and 3 for high. Too much use of the intermediate makes the poem sound dull. I even judge poems on their musicality.An example of numerical tanka with Tanakas judgment in words to the leftBringing out a book where the figures 1, 2 and 3 occur in various vertical combinations down the page, he says: These are called numerical tanka. The few words you see on the sides of the figures are my comments as a judge.Poetry, he said, is a combination of message and music. Readers focus only on the message. I want them to reflect on the artistic side of each word  its shape, its rhythm, the mix of Chinese and Japanese charactersThe conversation veers to how Japanese has borrowed Kanji characters from China in the 5th century. Does that mean Japanese people can read Chinese? They changed their grammar a lot down the years. The order of words now is totally different in the two languages. We can read ancient Chinese, from the time of say, Confucius.There was a movement after World War II to exclude Kanji characters from Japanese, replacing them with Western letters. But that did not work. However, Korean, which too was influenced by Chinese, introduced hangul, an artificial combination of consonant and vowel parts. For example, tat is one syllable in Korean.The editor-in-chief of the poetry magazine Kisaki refuses to accept that poetry is facing a crisis because of waning readership. The reading habit itself is going down, not just for poetry but for novels too. Other poets worry but I am from science. Initially even our research papers are read by a handful but it gains currency as others start citing our work. For poetry, too, I believe readership will come with time. The crisis is more real and immediate in case of publishers. Sale of books has gone down. Many poets are asked to buy back copies of their own work.He feels young poets need commercial support. Young researchers can have grants. But there is nothing for young poets.On second thoughts, he feels the problems of basic research and poetry are similar. Pharmaceutical companies provide grants but not for basic research on aspects like how human body parts work though that may open new horizons.His own work published in 1998 in Cell, a revered journal on microbiology, can help invent new drugs for psychiatric ailments like Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases.His identity as a scientist sits easy on the poets shoulder and vice versa. Mokichi Saito, the father of modern tanka, started this trend of connecting a poets life with his poetry. It is called the araragi school. He even wrote a tanka on eels which he likes professionally as a psychiatrist.Tanaka is just back from the US where he attended a meeting in Philadelphia on cell biology and then he hopped over to University of Pennsylvania to record a video session on the Japanese World War I poet Ayukawa Nobuo.We need to redefine Japanese literature in the context of world literature in the post-colonial age without depending on US-based translators who are often biased."

China imports about 4.5 million tonnes of surplus stocks mostly from Brazil, Thailand and Cuba, Abinash Verma MD, CEO of Indian Sugar Exim Corporation said.This is the first-time India is making a strong bid to export to China though India has exported about two lakh tonnes in 2007, he said.Besides East Africa and Sri Lanka, India is making a strong pitch for export of sugar to China and Bangladesh to cut losses due to surplus sugar stocks, he said.Today's meeting took place following the informal summit during which Prime Minister Modi had urged Xi to import Indian sugar, rice and pharmaceuticals, official sources here said.Modi was expected to have follow up discussions during his visit to Chinese city Qingdao to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to be held on June 9 and 10, Verma said.Today's meeting was organised by the Indian Embassy here.Speaking at the meeting, Counsellor Economic of Indian Embassy, Prashant Lokhande elaborated on the growing economic engagement between India and China and assured Chinese firms that India would emerge as a major sugar trading partner for China with consistent policies and quality product.ISMA officials said India hopes to export its sugars to China under the 50 per cent tariff category, though details are yet to be worked out.China charges 80 per cent tariffs on sugar imports. The response from the Chinese officials for India's offer of exports is extremely positive, Goel said.There were also inquiries whether the Indian firms could supply and match the quality, he said, adding that an invitation has been extended for the Chinese officials to visit Indian mills which have the most modern facilities.Those who attended the meeting included officials from China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, (CCPIT), China Sugar Association (CSA) and COFCO.The ISMA officials also called on Indian Ambassador, Gautam Bambawale, who informed them that exports of sugar was discussed during Modi-Xi meeting.

5b2f5f0a9855b70eb7de8294,'Anemia among pregnant women drops as open defecation declines',http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2018/jun/16/anemia-among-pregnant-women-drops-as-open-defecation-declines-1829120.html,2018-06-16,"By PTINEW DELHI: A new study has claimed a considerable drop of instances of anemia among pregnant women in India due to reduction of open defecation in villages, increased age at pregnancy and women's education.The study comes in the backdrop of Narendra Modi government's continuing push for open defecation-free villages in the country.Terming the three factors leading to drop in instances of anemia among pregnant women, the new study by researchers at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) said that when combined with diets rich in iron and folic-acid, these social changes may have long-lasting impacts in cutting down the ailment among Indian women.""Women of reproductive age experience a disproportionately large burden of anemia due to menstrual blood losses as well as higher nutrient requirements and increased blood volume during pregnancy, said Samuel Scott, lead researcher, IFPRI-South Asia Region.""Multi-sectoral public health policies and programmes that simultaneously target basic (e.g.early marriage), underlying (e.g.open defecation) and immediate (e.g. women's education and diet) factors are likely to have the greatest impact on anemia reduction among pregnant women,"" Scott said.Co-authored by IFPRI's Samuel Scott and Suman Chakrabarti, and colleagues from Oxford Policy Management and the Public Health Foundation of India, the study explores how shifts in socio-demographic, programmatic and dietary factors impact the prevalence of anemia among pregnant women in India.The study, recently published in the journal, Public Health Nutrition, was an analysis of 446 Indian districts and more than 17,000 pregnant women aged 15-49 years.""Anemia among pregnant women is concerning, as it increases the likelihood of maternal mortality, risk of infection, pre-term delivery, and poor fetal and infant health. The quality of life in anemic women is also impacted, with studies showing reduced work capacity as well as poorer physical performance and neuro-psychological outcomes,"" said Scott.India has the highest number of anemic individuals globally - nearly 53 percent of adult women and 50 percent of pregnant women in India are anemic according to the fourth round of India's National Family Health Survey in 2016, it said.Given the slow annual rate of anemia reduction from 2006 to 2016 and the high anemia prevalence in India, the World Health Assembly global target of a 50 percent anemia reduction among women of reproductive age between 2012 and 2025 is unlikely to be met, it added.According to the study, the observed average increase of 2.2 years in age at pregnancy and 22 percent reduction in village-level open defecation from 2002 to 2012 accounted for an estimated 7 percent and 9 percent of the observed anemia decline, respectively.However, a 6-7 percent increase in urbanization over a decade accounted for an estimated 1.7 percent increase in anemia.""It is possible that women who migrate to urban areas experience an increased risk of anemia due to non-sanitary environmental conditions in urban slums and an inadequate consumption of nutrient-rich foods due to food being relatively more expensive in urban areas,"" Scott pointed out.The research, which took into consideration a ten-year period from 2002 to 2012, found anemia prevalence among pregnant women fell by 16 percentage points.""Socio-demographic factors such as women getting pregnant later, being more educated and attending more antenatal care visits showed improvement. Open defecation and use of wood as cooking fuel, although still high, also showed a decline during the same period. The study did not find significant changes in household supply of folic acid and vitamin B12, but noted a decline in both iron and phytate supply, partly driven by a reduction in the consumption of rice and wheat,"" it said.The study finds that Indian households currently do not meet the recommended dietary intake levels of iron issued by India's National Institute of Nutrition guidelines in 2011.If recommended levels were met, anemia would be considerably reduced.For instance, an increased household supply of 30 mg per household per day (~7mg per capita) from 2012 levels predicts a 30 per cent anemia reduction in pregnant women.Findings suggest India's efforts to focus on making entire villages open defecation free and the promotion of diets rich in iron could have large nutritional benefits."

Stating that connectivity with neighbours and within the SCO area is a priority for India, Modi, during his intervention at the Summit in Qingdao, China, on Sunday said: ""We welcome new connectivity projects that are inclusive, sustainable and transparent, and respect countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity.""The SCO is a Eurasian inter-governmental organisation, the creation of which was announced in 2001 in Shanghai by Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. It was preceded by the Shanghai Five mechanism. India and Pakistan were granted full membership of the bloc in June last year. In the final Qingdao Declaration issued after the Summit, India's name is conspicuously missing in the part about the BRI.According to Anil Wadhwa, Senior Fellow in the Vivekananda International Foundation think tank and former Secretary (East) in the External Affairs Ministry, the meeting between Modi and Xi was a forward movement from the informal meeting between the two leaders in Wuhan in April with decisions being taken to set up a special representatives-level meeting mechanism and to boost cultural relations between India and China.As for India not extending support to the BRI, Wadhwa told IANS that nobody expected India to endorse Xi's pet initiative.""I don't think it will affect India diplomatically as there is an understanding between both sides (India and China),"" he said.""If they look at the Northeast in the future from the BBIN (Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal) rubric, that is a different matter.""However, Wadhwa sounded sceptical about the two agreements signed between India and China - a memorandum of understanding on the Chinese side providing hydrological data on the Brahmaputra river in flood season from May 15 to October 15 every year and an amendment to a 2006 protocol for exporting rice from India to China to include the export of non-Basmati varieties of rice from India.""With China already having built three dams on their side of the Brahmaputra, I don't know how useful the data will be,"" he said.As for exporting non-Basmati varieties of rice, he said that such a market does not currently exist in China and this has to be created.However, Sujit Dutta, a domain expert on China who is also Professor in the Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution in Jamia Milia Islamia here, was positive about the two agreements.""India kept its interests safe. While the agreement on sharing Brahmaputra will benefit India, the one on rice exports will help our farmers,"" Dutta said.As for the BRI, he said that India has always made it clear that it would not support the Chinese initiative.""How can India support something that threatens its sovereignty with the CPEC going through PoK?"" he said.Modi said in Qingdao that India's commitment to connectivity is visible nevertheless in the International North-South Transport Corridor, the development of the Chabahar Port in Iran, to which India, Iran and Afghanistan are signatories, and participation in specific projects like the Ashgabat Agreement, a multimodal transport agreement between India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Oman, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Another reason for India not taking part in the BRI, Dutta said, is that Chinese loans for projects under this have high interest rates and terms and conditions are not transparent.Giving Hambantota port in Sri Lanka as an example, he said that the port has been given to a Chinese company on a 99-year lease and Colombo will find it difficult to repay the loan.He said that same is the case with Gwadar port in Pakistan and Islamabad might well come under Chinese influence after finding it difficult to repay loans.""We (India) can't become vulnerable to Chinese pressure and take loans which we can't repay,"" Dutta said. According to C. Uday Bhaskar, strategic analyst and Director of the Society for Policy Studies think tank, the key takeaway from the SCO Summit ""is the manner in which India conveyed to its SCO peers that it can remain resolute when it comes to core national interests, for example, sovereignty"".""But it will also engage with the others in a principles, yet pragmatic manner,"" Bhaskar said.He said that the Indian stand on the BRI will be watched very closely not just by China, but all the other nations who have signed up.""Hopefully, the Wuhan spirit will prevail with respect to the BRI and make the issue less intractable when President Xi visits India in 2019,"" Bhaskar stated."

And in that context Xi told Modi that China is looking at enhancing agricultural exports from India including non-Basmati rice and sugar,"" Gokhale said.An agreement was signed between China's General Administration of Customs and India's Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare on Phytosanitary requirements for exporting rice from India to China, one of the world's biggest rice markets.The 2006 Protocol on Phytosanitary Requirements for Exporting Rice from India to China has been amended to include the export of non-Basmati varieties of rice from India.At present, India can only export Basmati rice to China.A couple of business delegations from India and the department of commerce have visited China in the recent months and it is hoped that this will lead to additional imports from India this year, he said.""The Chinese side also said that it will encourage our pharmaceutical companies to register for high quality Indian pharma products in the Chinese market.This was an important aspect from our perspective because we have been pressing for greater pharma exports into the country,"" the foreign secretary said.In response to the president's suggestion for enhancing financial cooperation between the two countries and also helping trade, the Prime Minister conveyed to President Xi India's readiness to permit the Bank of China to establish its branch in Mumbai,"" Gokhale said.China has been promising to address the issue of trade deficit with India which has been seeking a greater market access for its goods and services in China.Trade deficit with China stood at USD 36.73 billion during April-October this fiscal.India's trade deficit with China has marginally dipped to USD 51 billion in 2016-17 from USD 52.69 billion in the previous fiscal.India has been pressing China to open the IT and pharmaceutical sectors for Indian firms to reduce the massive trade deficit."

5b30d27c9855b71aeea8ecd2,India should take steps to ensure privacy in biometric identification programmes: IMF,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/apr/13/india-should-take-steps-to-ensure-privacy-in-biometric-identification-programmes-imf-1801056.html,2018-04-13,"By PTIWASHINGTON: The IMF has said India should take necessary measures to ensure privacy and security controls while implementing large identification programmes like the Aadhaar, as the global financial body identified India as a leader in the biometric identification system.The International Monetary Fund in its fiscal monitor report on digital government said digitalisation can facilitate stronger governance and fiscal transparency, allowing better public awareness and scrutiny of the budget process and the design of fiscal policy.In India, the IMF yesterday said, biometric identification and electronic payments have helped reduce leakages in LPG subsidies.""Depending on assumptions and how the reduction in leakage is expressed that is, the reduction in total transfers or wrongful payments, estimated savings from digitalisation range between 0.2 and 21 per cent of cash transfers and 11 to 24 per cent of wrongful payments,"" it said.""It is difficult to disentangle the effect of digitalisation from broader macroeconomic and policy developments,"" the IMF said.For example, the use of Aadhaar in the LPG subsidy scheme coincided with the termination of the LPG dual pricing system and the reduction in the world price of natural gas, both of which helped reduce the cost of LPG subsidies.Data limitations and lack of proper assessment frameworks constrain ex-post evaluations, the report said.""With more than 1.2 billion registered citizens in India's biometric identification system, Aadhaar, the country stands out as a leader in this area,"" the report said.The IMF, however, stressed that governments should take necessary steps to ensure privacy and security controls when implementing large identification programmes.""In India, privacy and security concerns led to alternating periods of mandatory and non-mandatory use of Aadhaar in social programmes,"" it said.""A court decision is still pending on its compliance with the right to privacy. In a recent data breach in India, it has been reported that 135 million Aadhaar numbers were compromised, underscoring the importance of sound privacy measures,"" it added.The report noted that spending should also be consistent with the government's budget constraint and will require policy-makers to create fiscal space for purchasing new technology, storing large amounts of data and hiring cyber-security experts.Cost estimates are rare and incomplete, it observed.""In India, data from the Unique Identification Authority of India place the costs of Aadhaar implementation and maintenance at about USD 1.5 billion or USD 1.25 per card between 2009 and 2017 but this compares favourably with the costs of other electronic identification systems of USD 3 to USD 6 per enrollee,"" the IMF said.Given its broad coverage, IMF believes that it may be a challenge to phase Aadhaar out.""Advocates of the system assert that Aadhaar is compatible with the right to privacy because the captured biometric traits are encrypted, making it difficult for anyone who intercepts these images to access the actual content,"" it said.""However, the lack of sufficient security controls makes the system vulnerable to unauthorised access,"" it added.""In a recent data breach, it has been reported that Aadhaar numbers and the corresponding identities of 135 million Indian citizens were compromised when service providers used their access to steal identity information.Privacy and security controls are therefore key when implementing large identification programmes, IMF said.The IMF in its report listed out central government implementing several digital platforms to overcome leakages in its subsidy scheme.""The so-called 'JAM trinity' has three pillars: Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile. Jan Dhan promotes financial inclusion, targeting universal access to banking facilities and facilitating the delivery of social benefits directly to bank accounts.""Aadhaar provides each citizen with a 12-digit unique identification number with demographic and biometric information (fingerprint and iris scan).With 1.2 billion residents enrolled, this is the largest biometric programme in the world. Finally, a mobile network covering more than 1.16 billion phones serves as an effective service delivery platform, especially in rural areas."" Under the Jan Dhan, bank accounts have been linked to Aadhaar cards, the report said, adding that this has enabled the delivery of social benefits through direct electronic payments to eligible bank account holders.Programmes linked to Aadhaar include the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme for LPG subsidies, the Public Distribution System for rice and wheat, and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act program, which provides 100 days of work for unemployed workers in a year.In 2008, the government digitalised the programme's wage payments and job applicants by linking their job cards to Aadhaar, IMF said."

The Rakhine migrants, who come from the poor but relatively stable south, are -- for now -- few in number. But they carry great expectations as the pioneers of a donor-led ""Rakhinisation"" plan to upend the demography of the once majority-Muslim area.""We were really afraid of those Kalars and didn't plan to come here,"" Chit San Eain, a 28-year-old who has moved with her husband and toddler into a basic hut in Koe Tan Kauk tells AFP, using a pejorative term for Muslims. ""But now that they are no longer here, we have the chance to meet again with our relatives who live up here,"" she added, the ruins of a Rohingya settlement lying a few kilometres away.Rohingya Muslim children wait for food handouts distributed by a Turkish aid agency at Thaingkhali refugee camp, Bangladesh. | APNearly 700,000 Rohingya have been driven from northern Rakhine into Bangladesh since August 25 last year by a Myanmar army offensive against Muslim militants. Another 300,000 Rohingya were pushed out from the south and centre of Rakhine by army campaigns stretching back to the late 1970s.The UN has branded last year's military crackdown ethnic cleansing, with a top official saying it carried all the ""hallmarks of genocide."" Myanmar vigorously denies the allegations and says refugees are welcome to return. But so far it has agreed to allow back only 374 of 8,000 refugees whose names have been put forward for the initial phase of repatriation.Many traumatised Rohingya in Cox's Bazar camps are also refusing to be repatriated to Rakhine -- where holding camps and hostile neighbours await them. In their absence a blizzard of development projects, government and army-sponsored or privately funded, are transforming northern Rakhine.Taking space vacated by fleeing Rohingya is an old game in a state seen as the frontline of a Buddhist nation's fight against encroaching Islam.""The military has been engineering the social landscape of northern Rakhine State so as to dilute the Rohingya population since the early 1990s,"" says Francis Wade, author of ""Myanmar's Enemy Within: Buddhist Violence and the Making of the Muslim 'Other'"".The Muslim minority are denied citizenship and labelled ""Bengalis"", outsiders who -- the logic runs -- have successfully been pushed back to their country of origin. In a pattern with echoes of ""the Israeli settler project in the West Bank"" Buddhist communities then move in, altering the ""facts on the ground"" gradually rubbing out Muslim rights to the land, he added.""I'd expect to see more Buddhists settle there over the coming years. And then we'll forget what the area once was, and that process of erasure will be complete.""- Rohingya out, Rakhine in -Chit San Ean is the beneficiary of the Ancillary Committee for the Reconstruction of Rakhine National Territory in the Western Frontier (CRR), a private scheme established shortly after the refugee crisis began. In a zone under a strict army lockdown the resettlement plan could not fly without military consent. Funded by ethnic Rakhine donors, the CRR's ambition is to establish a ""Muslim-dry"" buffer zone running the nearly 100 kilometres from state capital Sittwe to Maungdaw town, according to Oo Hla Saw, a Rakhine MP who advises the committee.""All of this area was under the influence of Muslims. After the military operations, they had to flee... so we have to establish this area with the Rakhine population,"" he told AFP. The CRR will fund jobs and homes ""so this little population can grow and grow,"" he added.It's a trickle so far, with around 64 households -- some 250 people -- moved by the CRR, with 200 more families on a waiting list. They are among the poorest of the poor, mostly daily wage labourers from Thandwe around 600 kilometres to the south or squatters from Sittwe. Two village tracts, Koe Tan Kuak near Rathedaung and Inn Din near Maungdaw, have been designated for the scheme so far. The army concedes the second site was the scene of extrajudicial killings of Rohingya captives as violence engulfed the region last August.Koe Tan Kauk was a similarly mixed settlement of Buddhist and Muslim homes. The CRR-sponsored hamlet promises a rudimentary existence. There is little work, no electricity or running water but donors have gifted each family a $450 shack on stilts, made from plywood and metal sheeting. New residents hope to eventually own land, a prospect previously beyond their reach in Myanmar's second-poorest state.Rakhine nationalists say the CRR is a bulwark against Islam and a means to ensure their ethnic group has a say in development projects driven by the Burmese-dominated central state, who they distrust deeply.""Who should be given priority other than Rakhines in Rakhine State?"" explained Than Tun, General Secretary of the CRR.- Cronies and soldiers -For its part, Myanmar's government has enlisted powerful businessmen to rebuild the infrastructure of the battered state. The army is running other projects including beefing up its security apparatus -- in what appears to be a multi-pronged effort to keep out the Rohingya.An Amnesty International report this week detailed how roads, helipads and security installations are being built, often on top of razed Rohingya settlements. They labelled the activity a massive ""land grab"" that threatens to erase evidence of alleged atrocities, including at Inn Din.Across northern Rakhine, abandoned land and rice fields have been commandeered by the army in an area with access tightly controlled to media, investigators and most aid groups. The Rohingya lost their legal status in 1982, under a junta-era Citizenship Law. Now their ancestral lands are being stripped away. That makes return impossible, according to lawmaker Oo Hla Saw.""These people want to be recognised as 'Rohingya' ethnicity... to enjoy citizenship, to resettle in their native grounds,"" he says. ""Their demands are unreasonable.""Despite their dangerous new neighbourhood, the arrivals at Koe Tan Kauk say they are there to stay.""I will end my life here,"" said a 69-year-old woman called Osar. ""I'm not going anywhere."""

Qatar denies the accusations.A Saudi government source said Prince Mohammed's choice of Egypt for his maiden overseas trip as crown prince ""reaffirms Saudi-Egyptian cooperation at the highest level"".Talks would cover regional rival Iran, the conflict in Yemen, counter-terrorism and energy cooperation, the source said.The crown prince is also expected to visit France in the coming weeks.'Uncertainty and turbulence'The diplomatic offensive comes as Prince Mohammed, a self-styled moderniser who has sought to project a liberal image of Saudi Arabia to investors, consolidates power to a level unseen by previous rulers.A dramatic shake-up announced on Monday saw military top brass, including the chief of staff and heads of the ground forces and air defence, replaced.Prince Mohammed's reshuffle came after he sidelined political rivals to become heir to the throne last June and orchestrated a royal anti-corruption purge in November that saw princes, ministers and tycoons locked up in Riyadh's luxury Ritz-Carlton hotel for nearly three months.""His first trip as crown prince is symbolically a moment for the young Saudi ruler to try to put Riyadh's best foot forward on the world stage,"" Andrew Bowen, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told AFP.""It comes at a time of uncertainty and turbulence at home and he has an upward task of both selling to the business community that Saudi is a stable and safe place to do business and that he has a steady hand on foreign policy despite Qatar and Yemen. This certainly won't be an easy sell.""The British government said Prince Mohammed's visit will help enhance cooperation in tackling challenges such as ""terrorism, extremism, the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Yemen"".But some protests are expected during his visit over the West supplying Saudi Arabia with arms despite the kingdom's role in the crisis gripping Yemen, said Mohamed Abdelmeguid, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.'Competitive rivalryThe crown prince's visit to the United States in late March, which a Saudi government source said could include multiple cities, would highlight the Trump administration's efforts to sign a nuclear cooperation accord with Saudi Arabia.Riyadh is expected to announce this year who will build the first two of up to 16 reactors, and negotiations are under way with the United States for its agreement to export technology needed for their construction.Besides the US company Westinghouse, Russian, French, Chinese and South Korean firms have all been seeking the Saudi contracts.Another key focus could be the Aramco initial public offering.The kingdom is preparing to sell under five percent of its state-owned oil giant, the crown jewel of the Saudi economy, in what is expected to be the world's largest ever IPO.""Prince Mohammed may seek to foster a competitive rivalry between a UK government desperate to attract Saudi investment to offset the Brexit chaos and his US hosts, particularly over the Aramco IPO,"" said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in the United States.US President Donald Trump hosted Prince Mohammed in March 2017, just weeks after taking office, and he chose Saudi Arabia for his first official overseas visit as president.Saudi Arabia has grown close to its longtime ally Washington under Trump, whose harder line on Iran and softer stance on arms sales are a welcome shift in policy for Riyadh.Saudi Arabia viewed Trump's predecessor president Barack Obama as too accommodating towards Iran -- particularly on negotiating a 2015 nuclear deal."

Kamaraj at the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) office here, he said the Puducherry government was coming across several hurdles and even to present the budget on time the government met with several blockades.The delay on the part of the Centre to grant funds and the unnecessary movement of files between the Cabinet and the Raj Nivas had been creating hurdles in the running of the administration.For instance, the budget which should have been submitted in May got delayed and was presented only on July 2 due to lack of sanction of funds and grants by the Centre.Mr. Narayanasamy said Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi took time to grant approval to files causing delay in implementing welfare schemes. In spite of this, the government was doing its best to implement the welfare schemes, including the free rice scheme, keeping in mind the well being of the people.The Chief Minister pointed out that only when there is Congress rule at the Centre can a Congress- led administration have a smooth sailing.He referred to the various instances where the Lt. Governor returned files without according approval to the decision of the Cabinet.Earlier, the Chief Minister paid rich tributes to K. Kamaraj. PWD Minister A. Namassivayam, Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy and functionaries of the party were present."

A situation of terror still exists. Such terror tactics of the government should stop.Ms. Hemalata said huge concession was being to given to private corporations such as Sterlite Copper. Nearly Rs. 5 lakh crore is given in concessions to corporates in India. But they are not taking environment laws seriously.Sttaing that contract labourers should also enjoy the same benefits as regular employees, she said, equal wages should be given to contract workers in the company as well.On Saturday, the CPI(M) distributed grocery supplies, including rice and pulses, for a month to families of the victims.The CITU president said the CPI(M) and other wings of the party would hold three events across the country soon with various demands. On August 9, CITU along with All India Kisan Sabha, will hold a mazdoor kisan rally in Delhi near Parliament.The demands would include increase in minimum wage and provision of social security to workers.On August 9, the party had also planned a nation-wide jail bharao agitation where the members would court arrest seeking similar demands.Yet another proteest was slated for the night of August 14 before Independence Day to oppose privatisation of public sector activities and infusion of foreign funds in order to protect the political and economic independence of the nation.She gave a compensation of Rs. 10,000 to 21 people who survived bullet injuries in the police firing."

Its favourable location on trade routes has meant a distinct Arabian influence on the cuisine, particularly that of the Muslim population of the Malabar region.There is alisa, a porridge with meat, similar to harissa, popular in west Asia, and a sort of chappati  but made with rice flour, not wheat  called ari pathiri, and of course there is the Malabar biryani, which uses cashew nuts and dry fruit.Now, if theres one perennial, unresolvable, fun and quintessentially Indian debate that comes close to which variety of mango is best, it is about which kind of biryani is tastiest. The people of Malabar have no doubt that their version is the most delectable. So much so that a couple of competing brands have battled in the courts over owner- ship of the word.Recipe for conflictThe flames were first lit in the Calcutta HC in 2012, when Parakh Vanijya Private Limited alleged that Baroma Agro Products use of the mark Malabar Gold for its special biryani rice amounted to an infringement. Parakh claimed it was using the word Malabar since 2001, and Baromas biryani rice label was identical and deceptively similar to its own mark.The Calcutta HC found some similarity between the two labels, and restrained Baroma from using the mark for the time being. A Division Bench also agreed.Baroma kept the fire burning, moving the Calcutta High Court to vacate the 2012 order, alleging that Parakh was relying on fabricated documents and that the company could not claim exclusive right over the word Malabar.In 2016, the HC sought to douse the coals and balance the interests of both parties, considering their substantial turnovers; it allowed Baroma to use the label Malabar with an increase in type size of not more than 25% of the rest of the words or letters on the pack.Now, it was Parakhs turn to strike back: the company moved the Supreme Court.On July 12, a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and R. Banumathi noted that Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Company manufactured Malabar Monsoon, and Tropical Retreats used Malabar Coast for its range of coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar and other products, and that the rules of registration itself were against any company claiming exclusivity over the term Malabar.Justice Banumathi, who wrote the judgment for the Bench, concluded, Since there is a disclaimer to the exclusive use of the word Malabar, the appellant has no right over the exclusive use of the word."

The beneficiaries have the choice of buying food grains from the open market.In view of complaints of the poor finding it difficult to get rice under the DBT, the Puducherry government, early this year, approached the Centre to permit it to revert to the old system of supplying rice. Last week, Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy told the Legislative Assembly that the Centre gave its in principle approval for the UTs request.Greater autonomyOn the question of whether cash transfer is an alternative to the public distribution system (PDS), the RBI has stated that the cash transfer mode reduced the need for large physical movement of food grains. Further, given the wide inter-State and intra-State variations in food consumption habits, the DBT provides greater autonomy to beneficiaries to choose their consumption basket, apart from enhancing dietary diversity.Another reason for promoting the concept of DBT is to reduce the leakage in the PDS, as the Central government has to absorb a huge food subsidy bill under the existing system of distribution of food grains in fulfilment of provisions of the National Food Security Act (NFSA).During 2017-18, the Centre provided the Food Corporation of India and States about Rs. 1.42 lakh crore towards the distribution of subsidised food grains.As for the processes to be followed by States prior to DBT execution, the RBI has referred to certain pre-conditions mentioned in the Central governments 2015 food subsidy rules. The pre-conditions include complete digitisation and de-duplication of the beneficiary database, and seeding of bank account details and Aadhaar numbers in the digitised database."

The government provides Rs. 6.13 paise per student for primary schools and Rs. 8.18 paise per student for upper primary and high school students, which included the egg cost. The government supplied rice free of cost and the midday workers had to procure the provisions to prepare the meals at the above said rates.Besides, they have to serve weekly three eggs to students. As the wages had not been released and the cost of provisions had increased in the last six months, I was forced to incur debts to the tune of Rs. 1 lakh to provide food to the students, said Vasumathi, a midday meal worker at the government high school in Sapthagiri colony in Karimnagar town. I did it in the hope that the government would release my wages accordingly, but in vain, she said.Sometimes, the government does not even supply rice on time forcing them to purchase it from open market, she said, adding that she would get higher wages when she went out to work as a construction labourer. She urged the government to increase their wages and commission to a fixed Rs. 10 per student. The midday meal workers are at the receiving end due to the inadequate supply of rice.The government supplies 50-kg bags, but each bag contains only 45 kg. There is a loss of 5 kg per bag, said ZPHS Nallagonda headmaster Prathap Reddy.He urged the government to check the leakages in the rice supplied to schools for the midday meals as they were being pilfered at various stages because of supply of fine quality rice."

(File)Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday asserted that Bihar deserves a 'special category status' by the centre, even as he acknowledged the ""extra assistance"" being provided by the Narendra Modi government to the state.The JD(U) national president, who has been demanding the special status for Bihar for past many years, said his government will also plead its case before the 15th Finance Commission when it visits Bihar.Typically, a 'special category status' is given to states that have been historically disadvantaged in comparison to others and it involves the centre assisting such states with greater fund allocation for centrally-sponsored schemes among other benefits.Speaking to reporters after his weekly public interaction programme Lok Samvad, Mr Kumar said Bihar is a land-locked state and investors are unlikely to put in their money here unless they are given some tax incentives and it would need support of special status.Justifying his demand for special status, the chief minister said Bihar was deprived of its rich natural resources with the creation of Jharkhand and large parts of north Bihar get ravaged every year by floods caused by rivers originating in Nepal.The 14th Finance Commission did away with the provision of grant of special category status, but many states including Bihar and Andhra Pradesh continue to demand this status.While the overall share of states in tax revenue has increased since the 11th Finance Commission recommendations, Bihar's share has undergone a steady decline, Kumar said, while adding that his government would plead its case before the 15th Finance Commission whenever it visits the state.The 15th Finance Commission, headed by former Bihar cadre IAS officer N K Singh, was earlier scheduled to tour the state last week but it was deferred at the eleventh hour.Asked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise of special package, Mr Kumar said there are sectors like roads where the centre is providing the state with extra assistance, but development of a state like Bihar is going to be a complex affair and therefore a special status is required.To a question on whether the BJP, which is a partner in the ruling coalition in the state, was not keen on a special status for Bihar, Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, who was sitting next to Mr Kumar, took the mike but side-stepped the question saying this was a press conference of the chief minister and it would not be proper for anyone else to speak.Mr Kumar has been pursuing special category status demand for Bihar for long. He has also held public rallies in support of the demand in Patna in October 2012 as well in Delhi in March 2013.The issue of special status has bounced back to national prominence after Chandra Babu Naidu-led Telegu Desam Party left the ruling NDA alliance at the centre over denial of the status to Andhra Pradesh.About the centre's recent announcement of 50 per cent hike in the minimum support price for farmers, the Bihar chief minister said these measures do help but it needs to be remembered that procurement by state governments take place primarily for rice and wheat since these food grains are used for the public distribution system.To help farmers who may be involved in cultivation of other items like pulses and vegetables, some innovative measures are needed, he said.Mr Kumar said some new ideas have been conceptualised in Bihar which include crop assistance scheme and input subsidies to farmers involved in organic farming."

In some aspects however, the creative ethnic people seem to break this rule that too without straying away from nature, as is their wont.The Raj Gonds of Kothaguda (G) in Utnoor mandal, a small village located by the side of the Utnoor-Jannaram road, follow an organic practice in paddy farming which saves them precious time which can even be applicable to all paddy farmers in the area. Instead of the traditional way of raising nursery by planting paddy seeds in a compact piece of wet land, the Adivasis in this habitation get the seeds to germinate within the leaves of teak and the medicinal vavili (Vitex trifolia) tree, a method evidently most suited under dry conditions.Raised platformWe call the process mande vatval meaning setting up of a raised platform, disclosed farmer Athram Bhujang Rao. We do so by first laying equal sized stones on the ground as pedestal upon which thin sized wooden poles are places to ensure flow of air from below, he continued.A bamboo mat is placed on the wooden poles on which a layer of teak leaves is arranged with perforations to let water drain out. The seeds of regular variety of paddy are placed on the teak leaves which are then covered with a layer made up of leaves of vavili, called nirgudi in Gondi, and a top layer of teak leaves, the farmer explained.About 30 kg of paddy seed is placed on this platform measuring 4 ft X 4 ft. Heavy objects like flat stones are placed on leaves on top to make the arrangement rather compact.The seeds are watered every morning and evening for three days in order to control the heat generated by the nirgudi leaves. The seeds begin sprouting on the second day itself and are ready for being raised in a conventional nursery, Ada Gangaram, who set up the nursery added.Time savingThis is a wonderful way of going about the initial process of paddy cultivation as it saves about 8 to 10 days for the farmer for taking up transplantation activity. It does help the farmers during the beginning of monsoon season when there is little water available for raising nurseries, opined retired Agriculture Officer in Adilabad C. Narsingu who conceded that it was for the first time that he got to know of the innovative method.As per the normal standards, about 30 kg of paddy seeds are planted in every acre. The yield is also normal at about 25 quintals per acre, Mr. Bhujang Rao pointed out.It maybe mentioned here that the Adivasis living along the Godavari river have paddy cultivation as part of their farming practices. Those living in the interiors had cultivated traditional varieties like red rice since centuries but the practice has almost vanished now."

It is up to the people to decide who is creating trouble for Kumaraswamy,"" Mr Koliwad told reporters.His remarks are being interpreted in political circles as a reference to Mr Siddaramaiah, whom he had openly attacked, blaming his ""dictatorial attitude"" for the defeat of the Congress in the recent Assembly polls in the state.Mr Koliwad reminded the Congress leaders that the government, led by Mr Kumaraswamy, was formed on the directions of the party high command.He said he firmly believed that the Congress-JD(S) coalition government has to run successfully and all the Congress leaders need to support it so that the two parties win the maximum number of seats in the Lok Sabha polls next year.Mr Kumaraswamy has been on a bumpy road since he became a chief minister on May 23, heading the coalition government, confronting wranglings over portfolio allocation and presentation of the budget.In his government's first budget on July 5, Mr Kumaraswamy, who also holds the finance portfolio, had unveiled a Rs 34,000 crore farm loan waiver, and later announced an additional crop loan waiver of Rs 10,700 crore from cooperative banks.However, his budget came under attack from within the coalition with several senior Congress MLAs, including former minister H K Patil, writing to him, demanding programmes for the minority community and the northern region of the state.Recently, Mr Siddaramaiah, who is also the head of the Congress-JD(S) coordination committee, in a letter to Mr Kumaraswamy, had pressed for withdrawing the hike on petrol and diesel prices and reduction in the supply of rice under the 'Anna Bhagya' scheme meant for the poor."

Water level in Servalar dam rose from 111 feet to 121 ft on Monday.Similarly, the level in Gadana dam (from 79 ft to 83 ft), Ramanadhi dam (from 74 ft to 80 ft) and Adavinainar dam (from 117 ft to 122 ft) also increased  as per Monday morning recording  following significant precipitation in the catchment areas.Karuppanadhi dam started overflowing on Sunday evening as water level reached the maximum of 71 ft. As water for the kar paddy season is being released from the dams since June 22, farming operations have moved to top gear.Farmers have started kar paddy cultivation in the district, which in all likelihood will result in Agriculture departments target of covering 10,000 hectares being exceeded.The department, to facilitate the farmers efforts in achieving the target, has stocked high-yielding certified seeds such as Co 51, Ambai 16 and Aaduthurai 45 in all Agricultural Extension Centres as these varieties gave excellent yield during the last pisanam season.Moreover, the farmers are being persuaded to go in for System of Rice Intensification cultivation as this technology would give increased yield with the use of minimum amount of water.Rainfall recorded in various places of the district was (in mm): Adavinainar dam 60, Gundar dam 52, Papanasam dam 43, Gadana dam 21, Servalar dam 20, Shencottai 18, Ramanadhi dam and Tenkasi 12 each, Karuppanadhi dam 9 and Kodumudiyar dam 7."

But a rainy season downpour flooded the tunnels, trapping them.Two British divers found them on July 2, squatting on a mound in a flooded chamber several kilometres inside the complex.Then the problem became how to get them back out through the tunnels, some completely full of fast-flowing flood water.All 13 were brought to safety over the course of a three-day rescue, organised by Thai navy SEALs and an international team of cave-diving experts.Piyasakol told reporters the health of all 13 had improved. Some had pneumonia when they were brought out of the cave but were recovering, he said.All will be discharged from hospital in the northern town of Chiang Rai on Thursday, he said.Crispy PorkSome of the group had lost as much as 5 kg (11 lb) but had regained some of the weight, and their appetites, in hospital, Piyasakol said.""I want to have crispy pork rice and barbecue pork rice,"" 15-year-old Pipat Photi said in the video.""I want pork knuckle rice, said 13-year-old Duangpetch Promtep.""Thank you for all the moral support.""Others said they were craving sushi.But while the group is good health, they still face challenges.One concern has been how they will deal with the fame, given the huge attention, both from within Thailand and beyond, on the case.The story is already set for a retelling by Hollywood, with two production companies looking to put together movies about the boys and their rescue.""We need to prepare both the children and their families for the attention they will receive when they come out,"" Piyasakol said.He warned relatives of the boys to resist giving interviews to media over fears they could have a negative impact on their mental health.""Everyone has worked well together to bring the children out.

""Everybody's heart stopped,"" he said.It was the moment they had all been waiting for, but that no one had wanted. It meant no new exit would be discovered, or drilled, and that the members of the Wild Boars soccer team, who ranged in age from 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old assistant coach could not leave any other way. The relentless rains were pumping daily deluges into the tunnels, constantly threatening to overwhelm the battery of borrowed pumps and swamping the boys' tiny refuge as a horrified world looked on.Anxious friends and classmates prayed for the safe return of the boys stuck in Tham Luang cave. It meant the air had begun to fail, with oxygen levels falling to near blackout levels. It had all come down to this last, best, terrible option that planners assumed would mean the death of least some of the boys, none of whom could swim. It meant pulling a terrified child through the frigid waters of the cramped, flooded, 2 1/2-mile-long gantlet that had already killed one expert diver.""You could hear everybody stop breathing,"" the officer said.The first boy would make it out, but would he make it out alive?The unprecedented rescue operation that gripped the world and overwhelmed this mountainous outpost in northern Thailand for three weeks - recounted here based on interviews with more than 30 participants - began June 23 with a flurry of texts messages: A lot of sons were late for dinner.Nopparat Khanthavong, the 37-year-old coach of the Wild Boars, knew his assistant coach had taken some of the younger players out for a Saturday bike ride while he watched his older team play.After the final whistle, Nopparat checked his phone and saw at least 20 worried messages from his players' parents asking why the bike riders had not returned. When he learned the children had persuaded his assistant to take them into the six-mile-deep Tham Luang Nang Non cave, he headed that way. The cave was popular, but Nopparat, standing under a darkening sky, knew that the rainy season was no time to be in those endless, flood-prone passages.He stopped to consider the abandoned bicycles around the entrance and the worsening precipitation rushing down a lushly wooded mountain slope. He raced in, screaming the names of his assistant and the boys.""I had no flashlight,"" Nopparat said. ""In just a few meters, I couldn't see anything.""But soon he did see lights, coming out from the deeper recesses. It wasn't his team; it was a group of park employees who also had seen the bicycles and gone to investigate.""If your players are in there, they are trapped,"" one told him, imploring him to calm down. Several hundred meters down the winding, narrowing passages, they had found water, blocking the way and rising quickly.When Napasorn Taturkarn's phone rang, the mayor of Baan Moo 9 was with a group of neighbors. They were practicing Thai music for the funerals and weddings she plans for the village of 700 houses less than two miles from the cave's entrance.It was her friend, Nopparat. ""I think my boys are in the cave,"" he said. ""Can you help?""The first responders to a crisis that would soon captivate millions were the musicians in her yard, Napasorn said. At the cave's entrance, they found Nopparat pacing frantically in the fading light.""He looked very concerned,"" Napasorn said.On July 2, Rick Stanton, a former firefighter, and John Volanthen made their way into the cave. The lights they shone reflected in 13 pairs of eyes that hadn't seen sunlight in days.While Nopparat and the village residents made another trip in, Napasorn called the Siam Ruamjai, the local volunteer emergency squad based in a pink building a few miles down the main road.""I've been in the cave before,"" said Niwat Tumploy, 27, who took the call. ""But only when it was dry. In the rains, that is a bad place.""Ten volunteers jumped in an ambulance and the back of a pickup. At the cave, five joined the growing crowd at the entrance; five went in, including Niwat. The rain had become a torrent. Water in the passage was up to their ankles even before they reached the watery impasse. Within two hours, it would be nearly to their waist.""There was nothing we could do,"" Niwat said. ""We needed the big guys.""The governor of Chiang Rai Province, Narongsak Osatanakorn, weeks away from being transferred to another part of the country, was getting ready for bed when he got word of the missing kids. He assumed it was ""just some boys in the cave, no big problem,"" he told The Washington Post.But after changing from pajamas to drive the 38 miles to the cave, he knew differently. Within hours, the first members of the Thai navy SEAL team arrived and went into the water.Thai SEALs practice rescues in open water.Thai Navy SEALS were unprepared for dark muddy currents running between sharp rock walls.Feeling their way along the jagged edges, they turned back. A bigger group tried again, but when they reached an intersection in the narrow passage, they were baffled. The cave was a maze, and the water was rising.""We could not fight with the weather or the water anymore,"" said Aparkorn Youkongkaew, the Thai navy SEAL commander in charge.A radio reporter arrived from Mae Sai; word began to spread. By daylight, local people were bringing food, a corps of volunteer cooks that would swell to more than a hundred. A truck arrived with a small industrial pump, which workers carried to the edge of the flood, the right idea at the wrong scale.""They were pumping, but they were not enough to handle so much water,"" said Kobchai Boonyaorana, a Thai disaster management official. ""The rains were getting harder. We needed more.""The call for pumps went out, and they began to arrive from all over the country. Worawut Imchit drove overnight from a shrimp farm 850 miles to the south, four flatbed trucks carrying four of the massive pumps that circulate water through the ponds.""It was three sleepless days for me,"" said Imchit. ""I ran like a crazy man, up and down, back and forth between the pumps to make sure everything was functioning normally.""Within three days, more than 40 machines had arrived, Kobchai said. At more than 400,000 gallons an hour, the pumping power stabilized the water level, and lowered it on drier days. Downhill, it flooded the fields of 128 farmers, destroying their rice harvests for the year.Inside, divers said they worked without any sense of day or time in the all-consuming darkness.As teams got deeper into the cave, radio links broke. The teams resorted to hand-carried notes, messengers running and swimming the communiques in relays. Commanders lost touch with their men for hours at a time.On June 27, fast-rising waters filled the cave - so fast that it would be the equivalent of a house flooding in 10 minutes.Asaf Zmirly, an Israeli living in Bangkok, arrived with radios flown in from Israel that could operate within the cave, adjusting to the topography and creating a daisy-chain-like network. Just the shallow foray he made into the water to establish the system was daunting.""If you look to your right or the left, the mask will be pulled off your face,"" Zmirly said.Even when they could talk to each other, searchers did not know where to look or how to find their way. The SEALs would find themselves essentially lost after hours-long dives, with still no sign of the young boys. On June 27, fast-rising waters filled the cave - so fast that it would be the equivalent of a house flooding in 10 minutes.""Our three hours of draining became nothing,"" the Thai navy commander said.They found help from an unlikely expert.Vernon Unsworth, a British insurance consultant and hobbyist spelunker, has made an obsession of the Tham Luang cave system. He had explored miles of it over a decade, planning his travels between England and Thailand around the rainy season. He was convinced that the Thais were looking in the wrong place. Unsworth had strong views on where to look and who should be doing the looking.""Time is running out,"" he wrote in a letter to the governor, according to Unsworth's wife. He listed the names of three British cave divers he pegged as the best in the world. ""Please contact them through UK Embassy ASAP.""The Thai government agreed.Expert divers from six countries worked alongside Thai Navy SEAL to rescue the boys and their coach,.Within days, his Brits were in the cave, and a search that most had given up as futile took an electrifying turn.On July 2, Rick Stanton, a former firefighter, and John Volanthen, an IT consultant, used Unsworth's maps to reach a chamber more than 2 1/2 miles from the entrance. When their headlamps emerged from the water, they reflected in 13 pairs of eyes that had not seen sunlight in more than 200 hours.The boys and their coach were alive after nine days of pitch-black isolation, six without any food. Clinging to a slippery slope 15 feet above the current, they had licked water droplets from the limestone walls. Their assistant coach, Ekapol Chanthawong, a former Buddhist novice monk, taught them to meditate to keep them calm.""How many of you? Thirteen? Brilliant,"" Volanthen said. He assured them: ""Navy SEALs will come tomorrow, with food and doctors and everything.""Instantly, a search had turned into a rescue. Hundreds of volunteers and military personnel clogged the mountain roads to the cave, an ad hoc battalion of experts and adventurers from around the world.More than 1,500 journalists descended on the small town, racing to feed an insatiable interest in the scrappy teammates, some of whom were stateless migrants from a lawless region of neighboring Myanmar. The boys, assumed lost, now had a fighting chance to make it. Their families, who had been keeping vigil in a muddy encampment outside the cave, were jubilant.Piyada Chermuen, 16, came from the same village in Myanmar as Adul Sam-on, the English-speaking boy able to communicate with the British divers. They lived in the same Christian church with 20 other refugees, most of whom were sent to Thailand by their parents so they could go to school.Adul, 14, one of the Wild Boars' best players, speaks five languages.""We were praying for him when the teacher ran in and said they had been found,"" Piyada said. Outside her classroom, a string of photos of Adul hung like prayer flags. ""Thank God. We cheered so loud.""At the cave, activity exploded. Thai police set up satellite parking areas and shuttled volunteers - who came to number more than 9,000. Commanders established one-way traffic lanes within the cave. Deeper in the chamber, four SEALs kept watch on the boys as their comrades ferried in field rations and water.Ideas came from every corner: a network of corrugated pipes the boys could crawl through; floating them out in body bags. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk began construction of a custom kid-sized minisub.But rescuers were focused on three possibilities: diving, drilling and waiting.Multiple crews scoured the slopes for a spot to bore an access hole. After testing more than 100 sites, only 18 were deemed even remotely viable. And even drilling into the right hole could cause a deadly cave-in.Waiting out the rains was quickly dismissed by many of the rescuers. Unsworth cautioned them that flooding from northern Thailand's monsoon season can last into winter, raising the possibility that the kids and their guardians would be perched on the cold, dripping slope for five months. Feeding them would require some 2,000 meals. And oxygen was proving to be a critical need just two days in. With more adults in the cave, O2 levels were dipping.Saman Kunam, a retired Thai navy diver, was working to fix that on the night of July 6. He and his team were staging oxygen tanks along the flooded passage, with tubes to pipe it to the boys' chamber. Navy commanders paced outside the cave's mouth as hours dragged by without word from the team. The divers finally emerged seven hours later, carrying a lifeless body: Saman's own tank had run out.After officials announced his death at a morning briefing, even some of the boys' families questioned the viability of having their sons dive out. They suggested that waiting for the dry season might be best, Nopparat, the coach, told The Washington Post. The jubilation that erupted after the boys were found drained away.Prayuth Jetiyanukarn, the robed abbot of the hilltop Buddhist monastery where the assistant coach often slept, penned a short letter to the young man, slipped it in a plastic tube and gave it to a Thai diver who promised to carry it in.""Be patient. Try to build your encouragement from the inside,"" it read, according to the abbot. ""This energy will give you the power to survive.""Inside the cave, though, were 12 soccer players, still trapped in deteriorating conditions. Preparations for a water exit were building.Rescuers built a mock-up of the tight passage with chairs. They practiced with local boys of the right size in a school swimming pool, perfecting the muscle memory they would need in the cave, said the U.S. Air Force officer.Inside the cave, the boys and their coach told their rescuers they were ready to go.""They were the ones who needed the least convincing,"" said U.S. Air Force Maj. Charles Hodges, who led the American team and was so new to his new posting that his belongings had not arrived in Okinawa, Japan.On July 6, the American military and Thai SEALs took a jointly concocted plan to senior Thai government officials. The interior minister was among those who arrived at the cave entrance by motorcade. Using Unsworth's maps and his understanding of the chamber's topography and hydrology, they pressed their point to about 60 representatives from the civilian government: It was time to act, even though they fully believed that some of the boys would not survive the swim. Their message: Save most of them now or lose all of them soon.""You can wait until that finite window of time is over,"" Hodges said he told Thai officials, ""and I can almost guarantee you that all of them will die.""The Thai interior minister requested that Hodges and about eight others go into a private room. He wanted to hear their plan again. Hodges explained the mission's two parts, emphasizing it would take an entire day of preparation before the first boy would be pulled through the water. The Thais would continue to search for a drilling site if the diving plan failed.They got their green light.On July 7 - two weeks to the day since the boys went missing - the rescue plan, while not publicly acknowledged, was underway.Air tanks were stashed along the muddy passageways, enough for the 12 boys, their coach, the four SEALs who had embedded with them, and the 18 divers who would carry them out. Riggers strung a web of static ropes for hoisting the cocoon-like stretchers over vast fields of jagged rocks.By 10:30 a.m. on July 8, the core team of 18 divers was in the water: Among them, Brits, Thai SEALs and diving buddies from the Gulf of Thailand beach resort of Koh Tao.One group made its way to the final chamber. By the time the divers emerged, the players and Coach Ek, as Ekapol was known, had elected the boy who would go first. Officials have refused to identify him, but friends and parents said he was Mongkol Boonpiem, a 13-year old with a lucky name: ""the auspicious one.""The wet suit, the smallest they had, still did not cling to his emaciated frame like it should. They readied the mask, attached to a tank filled with 80 percent oxygen. The rich mixture would saturate his tissues, making him easier to revive if he stopped breathing.Richard Harris, an Australian anesthesiologist and cave diver, gave the boy a final assessment. The boy was given what Thai and American participants described variously as a muscle relaxant or anti-anxiety medication. A panic attack in a chokepoint no bigger than a manhole would almost certainly be fatal.Finally, the boy was swaddled in a flexible plastic stretcher - akin to a tortilla wrap, Hodges said - to confine his limbs and protect him from the cheese-grater walls. And then, with his teammates watching, they pulled him under the murky water.The original plan had called for two divers - one in front of the stretcher, one behind. But that configuration was scrapped as too bulky for the shoulder-width passages and elbow turns.""Having that second person provided you nothing,"" the U.S. Air Force officer said.Instead, a diver kept the swaddled boy in a body-to-body clinch for as much of the swim as possible, the officer said, handing the boy over to a fresh diver after his designated stretch. Keeping the child warm was critical.""Even then the divers would get cold,"" the Air Force officer said. ""That is a lot of time in the water, and water is constantly running in there because of the flow, so that pulls that body heat away even if you have a wet suit.""The worst portion of the swim was the last one, a deep tubular swoop that held the water like a sink trap. All told, it was a grueling two-hour trek through muck-filled passages.""It is crawling through mud and underwater tunnels, and you can't see your hands,"" said Erik Brown, a Canadian diver who was among the 18.But it was the end of the deadliest part.""Fish on!""The divers lifted the boy, and the crew at the edge of the water pulled him out. Their dry, final passage out was lined with more than 100 rescuers. One of them, the U.S. Air Force officer, put his ear to the boy's mask.He was breathing. And now, the rescuers could, too.""It was a huge weight off our shoulders,"" the officer said.A diver, Erik Brown said he had spent a total of 63 hours in the Tham Luang cave.They got three more out that day, four the next and five on the last. They were hard to distinguish with their face masks, apart from Coach Ek, who still had his wolf-shaped ring on a finger. With each repetition, they grew more efficient.On July 10, a helicopter's lights shone down on the town of Mae Sai, its whir breaking through the night sky. Celebrations erupted - the last boy was alive, on his way to the hospital. Rescuers cracked open beers, hugging and trading high-fives.Then they caught themselves. Four Thai navy SEALs were still in the deepest chambers, making their way out after volunteering to keep vigil with the boys.Disaster almost struck.The pumps had held the water at bay until the last moments, when one of the industrial-sized hoses burst, pouring water back into the cave. The divers who stayed made a run for it.""Guys started diving down this hill and trying to get out,"" said the Air Force officer, who was the very last person out of the cave. ""It was a little dicey.""In town, drivers honked car horns in the streets. Family members rushed to the eighth floor of the hospital in Chiang Rai, an hour away. There, crowds gathered behind barriers flanking the entrance and cheered every arriving ambulance. Inside, doctors declared the Wild Boars in good health overall, releasing video of them waving from their group ward.After 21 days together in darkness, they were still side-by-side in the bright fluorescence of a welcoming world.(Panaporn Wutwanich, Jittrapon Kaicome and Katcha Rerngsamut contributed to this report)"

Kumaraswamys statement that he was unhappy and was drinking poison like Vishakantha seems to have not gone down well in the Congress with several leaders, including M. Mallikarjun Kharge, claiming that such remarks will portray the party in poor light ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.Mr. Kharge said there are several pulls and pressures in the coalition arrangement and the Chief Minister should master the art of running such a regime. His desperate statement will damage the Congresss prospects and people will blame the party for Mr. Kumaraswamys inability to run the coalition government smoothly, he said.The JD(S) with its 37 MLAs has joined hands with the Congress (80 seats) to form the government. Apparently, the government has been facing teething problems since day one. Going against former Chief Minister Siddaramaiahs wishes, Mr. Kumaraswamy presented the full-fledged budget. The Chief Ministers budgetary proposals on hike in taxes on fuel prices and reduction of quantity of rice from 7 kg to 5 kg have been strongly opposed by the Congress.Believed to have been irked by the opposition to some of the proposals and media publicity, Mr. Kumaraswamy had said: All of you are happy because your elder or younger brother has become the Chief Minister. But Im not happy. Im swallowing my own pain like poison, like Vishakantha (Lord Shiva, who drank poison to save the world). The Congress leaders said that the JD(S) has been given amrutha (nectar) by giving the Chief Ministers post and plump portfolios, including Finance.Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara said: How can he say that? He surely must be happy. The Chief Minister has to be happy always; if hes happy we will all be happy.D. Sudhakar, MLA, said Mr. Kumaraswamy should be grateful to the Congress for making him the Chief Minister. Former Minister A. Manju termed the Chief Ministers emotional outburst as crocodile tears.Meanwhile, former Speaker K.B. Koliwad blamed some Congress leaders for the Chief Ministers unhappiness and alleged that some of them disliked continuation of the coalition government.Speaking to presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Koliwad said: I dont understand why some Congress leaders are against the smooth running of this government?The Congress would win more seats in the Lok Sabha elections only if it joins hands with the JD(S), he said. Reacting to Mr. Koliwads comments, State Congress president Dinesh Gundu Rao said there was no need for discussion on the former Speakers comments. He (Mr. Koliwad) expressed his personal opinion. Some teething problems are common in a coalition government."

Don't blame yourself,"" said a letter to him from the boys' relatives released July 7.In reply he scrawled a note apologising to the parents, and vowing to take ""the very best care of the kids.""The touching note won the hearts of the Thai public -- a group to which he is yet to officially belong.The UN refugee agency says Thailand is home to around 480,000 stateless people.Many are from nomadic hill tribes and other ethnic groups who have for centuries lived around Mae Sai, the heart of the ""Golden Triangle"" -- a lawless wedge of land bisecting Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and China.'No nationality.

A diver in front led the way, with a boy tethered to him and another diver following behind.Each arduous round-trip extraction took between nine and 11 hours.Finally, on Tuesday, the ""all-star"" team of expert cave divers from at least six countries completed the mission once feared impossible, pulling to safety the last of the 12 young soccer players and their 25-year-old coach from the remote cave where they were marooned for more than two weeks.""We've rescued everyone,"" said Narongsak Osatanakorn, the former governor of Chiang Rai province and the lead rescue official, as volunteers and journalists erupted in jubilant cheers and claps. ""We achieved a mission impossible.""The Thai navy SEALs added in a Facebook post: ""We are not sure if this is a miracle, a science, or what.""The disappearance of the boys and their novice monk turned soccer coach from this small town on the Thailand-Myanmar border - remarkably found alive nine days after they went missing June 23 - launched an extraordinary saga of international cooperation and ingenuity, as experts from many fields planned how to maneuver all 13 out alive.When no clear opening could be found atop the mountain range housing the cave, having the boys swim out with the 18-strong team of British, Australian, Chinese, Thai, American and Danish divers was considered the least risky of a range of daunting options.The dramatic three-day mission kicked off Sunday after days spent preparing the cave - and the boys. One diver said in a Facebook post that he had spent 63 hours in the cave system over the past nine days.The effort that swelled and gained momentum after the group was found last Monday involved more than 100 other rescuers inside the cave, 1,000 members of the Thai army and almost 10,000 others who facilitated everything from rides up to the cave site to meals of fried chicken, eggs and rice and noodle soups for divers, volunteers and journalists. International experts set up rescue communications, while Thai villagers set up coffee stalls and massage stations.The mission was also a race against the weather.Rescuers had spent days balancing the risk of impending monsoons, which could have flooded the cave again, against the boys' readiness, weakened as they were by their ordeal. Rain fell periodically throughout the three days of extractions, but pumping efforts were so successful that the amount of time the boys spent underwater was minimized, officials said.Tension that had gripped this small town near the site finally broke Tuesday evening as the last of the ambulances turned on their lights and sirens and raced downhill from the cave. Thai police lining the road from the entrance laughed and flashed thumbs ups at the vast numbers of news organizations from all over the world waiting for this very scene.Onlookers cheered, ""Hooyah moo pa!"" - a reference to the name of the boys' soccer team, Moo Pa, or Wild Boars.A hint of setting sun and blue skies broke through the heavy clouds behind the caves as a helicopter whirred through the sky, carrying the last boys recovered to a hospital in nearby Chiang Rai.Thai navy SEALs and an Australian medic who had been stationed with the boys for days, preparing them for their dive, were brought out of the cave soon after.British diver Rick Stanton was one of the first to discover the boys and their coach in the cave.On Sunday, officials decided they could no longer wait, saying conditions were ""as perfect as they will be"" for a rescue attempt. Over the next three days, the boys were brought out in groups: four on the first day, four on the second and four, plus their coach, on Tuesday.Among those rooting for their rescue were world leaders, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and billionaire inventor Elon Musk, who tasked his team of engineers with building a ""kid-sized submarine"" made out of rocket parts that would be able to move the young boys through the cave's narrow passageways.Shortly after the full rescue was announced, President Donald Trump sent a congratulatory message.""On behalf of the United States, congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand. Such a beautiful moment - all freed, great job!"" he wrote.Doctors attending to the eight boys who were rescued Sunday and Monday said they are generally in good health. It was an incredible result considering that the boys spent nine days incommunicado, without food, until they were found, and then waited days more before embarking on an hours-long dive that even the most skilled cave divers have described as among the most dangerous they have attempted.A retired Thai navy SEAL died Friday after he ran out of oxygen while placing compressed-air tanks along the exit route.""Doctors have treated the boys, and now all of them are OK and cheerful and are talking normally,"" said Jesada Chokedamrongsuk, permanent secretary of the Thai Ministry of Public Health. One of the boys initially had a heartbeat that was too slow, and some had low white-blood-cell counts, but they have since been stabilized. Two have been treated for minor lung infections, doctors added. They were all treated for rabies - in case there were bats in the cave - as well as tetanus, and they were given IV drips.Phuket based diver Ben Reymenants was also a part of the rescue ops.Doctors expect the boys to be in the hospital for about seven days, although they could be out sooner if their bloodwork comes back negative for abnormalities.None of them have fevers, and all are able to eat normal ""medical"" food, Jesada said, an improvement from the watered-down porridge they were fed when they were first rescued. A nutritionist is monitoring their diet and has recommended that they eat nothing spicy or salty - despite the boys' cravings for spicy basil pork and rice and grilled pork.By Monday evening, the boys were able to joke, laugh and have normal conversations, doctors said. So far, their families have seen them through a glass barrier.Officials said that families of the rescued group were preparing to head to Chiang Rai, finally able to see their loved ones after weeks of agony. Among them was Umporn Sriwichai, an aunt of assistant coach Ekapol Chanthawong.

All our efforts now are being devoted to caring for the people who are here.""Despite the modest conditions, evacuees said they were simply grateful to be safe and have a place to shelter.Pressed, some acknowledged they would like a hot meal, and perhaps a designated place for women and girls to change.""There is no place to hide, really, except for places like bathrooms. It's hard on girls,"" said Hiroko Fukuda, 40, mother of an Okada Elementary student.Her 11-year-old daughter stayed at the shelter for a few days but eventually started refusing food and is now staying with her cousins.""But we can't complain,"" Fukuda said. ""All of this helps.""For Yusuke Yoshida, sheltering at the school was a chance to revisit childhood memories.""This is the first time I've been back in 30 years,"" the 43-year-old said, lying on the gym floor.He had spent the last two days working to clear the flood-hit home he shares with his parents and a brother.The ground floor was completely submerged by flood water by Saturday morning, and the family survived by moving to the second floor until Sunday morning, when they were rescued by troops on a boat.""I am happy to receive rice balls.

However, for the last six months, tribals say they can't rely on them.""We are not getting enough cash in hand so how can we buy grains. The government might give us free ration but that is not all. What about drinking water, electricity and other facilities that we require?"" says Ponthijoy Tripura.For seven consecutive years till 2015, Tripura had been the best performing state in country in the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), a central scheme that guarantees ""right to work"".In Tripura, the scheme meant more man days for tribals. But that was not enough for the Left to win this year's assembly polls. Eighteen of the 20 tribal reserved seats went to the BJP-IPFT alliance. Their promise of speedy facelift of tribal areas probably convinced the voters in these constituencies.While the power shifted from Left to right following a historic mandate three months back, life has not changed much for the tribals in the remote areas. The tall claims of the central government on rural electrification also fall flat here, the villagers say.The roads are in a poor condition and for water, the villagers say, they still depend on the dirty rivulets.""Lack of employment has been causing acute shortage of resources for the people. I am told some people have migrated to Bangladesh due to unemployment,"" says Jitendra Chaudhury, Member of Parliament from the Tripura East constituency. The new government says it plans to do a lot more.However, Deputy Chief Minister Jishnu Devvarma, says, ""As far as MNREGA is concerned, we have created 22 lakh man days. In the corresponding period last year, the figure was at 8-9 lakh. It started late this time because last year, funds had to be curtailed by centre because of the discrepancies by the previous left government.

The government's fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, at 3.3 percent of GDP, is already under pressure due to high oil prices.""With funding under stress, the government can't widen the scope of agri purchases,"" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""And even if it does, there is no storage available and you can't build storage in two-three months.""The ministries of agriculture and food did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The government said its limited purchases could cost it Rs 150 billion this year, although industry officials say it is difficult to estimate actual spending, which depends on the quantity procured.MSPs typically dictate crops that most farmers opt for, often leading to a glut of certain commodities, millions of tonnes of which have to be sold into a depressed local market at well below the cost of production, sparking angry farmer protests across the country.""What's the use of a hike when we did not even get last year's MSP?"" asked Purshotam Sontakke from a village in Wardha district in Maharashtra, who sold soybean at Rs 2,700 per 100 kg in 2017, 11 percent below the state-set price.A crash in farm commodity prices over the past few months has led to a waning of PM Modi's popularity in the countryside - where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live - prompting the premier to invite a group of farmers to his residence last week and promise MSPs at 1.5 times of input cost.He called the latest hike historic and said he was committed to do more for farmers. His stated goal is to double farmer's income by 2022.LACK OF STORAGEState agencies bought only 71 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2017/18 out of 210 million tonnes produced. In the same year, the country produced hundreds of millions of tonnes of oilseeds and horticulture crops like onion and potatoes, which are not typically procured by the government.The food ministry told parliament in March that the peak storage demand for food grains like rice and wheat was 60 million tonnes for the central pool, compared with a capacity of 73.5 million tonnes, 17 percent of which was open storage covered by plastic or other material.The ministry says on its website that the government will add more storage capacity by 2020.""Higher MSPs are welcome but there is inadequate public procurement at MSP, except in the case of wheat and rice,"" said M.S. Swaminathan, an renowned agriculture scientist.""This is clear from the experience of farmers who cultivated more pulses, on the expectation of procurement but were let down by a crash in market prices.""ELECTION PLEDGEDuring election campaigning in 2014, PM Modi promised steep hikes in MSPs and the doubling of farmers' income soon after becoming prime minister.But double-digit food inflation and a higher fiscal deficit forced him to raise MSPs only by low single digits over the past four years. This year's hefty hike marked a major shift in the government's approach.But Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said farmers sold below MSP even last year and were likely to do so again given piles of grains and sugar lying in private warehouses.The below-MSP rates, however, are as much as 30 percent higher than global prices for some commodities like pulses, making exports uncompetitive, Galipelli added.The latest hike will only widen the difference and hit India's farm exports, which fell to $33 billion in 2016/17 from $42.6 billion in 2013/14, said the India head of a global trading firm who declined to be named citing company policy.""The glut will only increase in the country with higher MSPs,"" he said.

But he did not come home.Instead Night, his 11 teammates and their 25-year-old coach made the ill-fated decision to walk into the Tham Luang cave after training.The boys chipped in to buy snacks to take down to the cave to mark his birthday, relatives at Night's village of Vieng Hom said on Wednesday.They speculated it was those snacks that sustained them during the nine-day ordeal before they were found late Monday huddled in the dark on a muddy bank, flood waters ominously beneath them.It was meant to be very different, says Night's sister Phunphatsa.""We prepared dinner to celebrate and some relatives came to join.""""The cake is in the fridge.

I'm fine.'"" Night's mother Supaluk told AFP.""It's very good to see he is safe.

The waiver, which would cost the state Rs 34,000 crore, would apply to crop loans of up to Rs 2 lakh. Besides, arrears will be waived for defaulters so they can get fresh loans. For this, the Chief Minister said, Rs 6,500 crore has been earmarked in the 2018-2019 budget.There are incentives for farmers who repaid loans in time. ""I have decided to credit the repaid loan amount or Rs 25,000, whichever is less, to each farmer's account,"" Mr Kumaraswamy said in his budget speech.Later, Mr Kumaraswamy told NDTV that Rs 34,000 crore ""will be disbursed in 4 phases... 10,500 crores has already been allotted in this budget.""The relief for the agrarian community was the centerpiece of the maiden budget of the state's Congress-JD(S) government announced by Chief Minister Kumaraswamy today.The measures had been cleared in the meeting held by the coordination committee of the Congress and Mr Kumaraswamy's JD(S) held on Sunday. The committee had also approved irrigation projects worth Rs. 1.25 lakh crore.The farm loan waivers had been high on the agenda of the JD(S) ahead of the elections. Mr Kumaraswamy had promised that he would waive all farm loans within 24 hours of coming to power.Ahead of the budget, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had also mentioned the issue in a tweet:On the eve of the Karnataka Budget, I'm confident our Congress-JDS coalition Govt will act on our commitment to waive farmer loans & to make farming more profitable.This budget is an opportunity for our Govt. to make Karnataka a beacon of hope for farmers all across India.

""I can't answer each criticism of the BJP - they see everything with jaundiced eyes,"" he added.Mr Kumaraswamy had gone ahead with the budget presentation despite the disapproval of His predecessor Siddaramaiah, who was heard questioning the need for a new budget citing the one he presented in February, before the assembly elections.

He said he did not need felicitation when the people of the State did not take him into confidence and bring the party to power on its own strength.The Chief Minister said he was upset with the criticism he faced within two months of forming the government. I dont waste time and energy to save my chair. I have inherited the legacy of my father H.D. Deve Gowda, who quit the post of Prime Minister, he said.Citing fiscal hurdles in increasing the quantity of rice given to BPL card-holders from 5 kg to 7 kg, he said an additional Rs. 2,500 crore would be needed for the purpose.Expressing his limitations in implementing the promises made in the run-up to Assembly elections, the CM said: I dont know whether farmers are satisfied or not. The BJP is still accusing me of not fulfilling promises on old age pension, allowance for pregnant women, among other things. Holding party workers responsible for the JD(S) not coming to power on its own, party patriarch Mr. Deve Gowda said they had failed to properly spread awareness about the programmes introduced by Mr. Kumaraswamy during his previous 20-month tenure as Chief Minister.He said the JD(S) had to work in tandem with the Congress to fight the formidable Opposition that is the BJP, and even though people failed to support the party, Mr. Kumaraswamy would do everything in his powers to fulfil his poll promises."

The decision, taken by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, comes less than a year before the 2019 general election. An announcement to give farmers a price of 1.5 times of cost was made by Union Minister Arun Jaitley in Budget 2018 presented on February 1 this year.The announcement of higher MSP coupled with the forecast of normal monsoon this year, could further boost foodgrains output. However, a higher support price could also fuel food inflation.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), in its meeting, approved the MSP of 14 Kharif (summer-sown) crops. According to sources, the MSP of paddy (common grade) has been increased by Rs 200 to Rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of Grade A variety by Rs 160 per quintal to Rs 1,750.The MSP of paddy (common) was Rs 1,550 per quintal and Rs 1,590 per quintal for paddy (grade A) variety. The MSP of cotton (medium staple) has been increased to Rs 5,150 from Rs 4,020 and that of cotton (long staple) to Rs 5,450 from 4,320 per quintal.In pulses, tur MSP has been raised to Rs 5,675 per quintal from Rs 5,450, and that of moong to Rs 6,975 per quintal from Rs 5,575. Urad MSP has been hiked to Rs 5,600 from Rs 5,400 per quintal. Hike in paddy MSP will increase the food subsidy bill by over Rs 11,000 crore based on procurement figure of the 2016-17 marketing year (October-September).The Food Corporation of India (FCI), the government's nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains, buys wheat and rice from farmers at MSP and supplies the grains under the food security law.Paddy is the main kharif (summer sown) crop, the sowing of which has already begun with the onset of southwest monsoon. Earlier, sources had said that the MSP rate proposed by the agriculture ministry is higher than the government's farm advisory body Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), considering growing farm distress because of a fall in prices of most crops, owing to bumper production.India is estimated to have harvested a record foodgrains production at 279.51 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) on all-time high output of rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses."

The GST was rolled out with five different tax slabs: zero percent, 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent. Though GST was appreciated as a one-stop solution to all indirect tax related woes and the problem of spate of state taxes and levies, but it was condemned for keeping nearly 250 items in the highest tax bracket, which is 28 percent.Nearly four months after the GST was rolled out, the 23rd GST Council meet that took place in Guwahati on November 10 slashed the tax rates from 28 percent to the lower slabs on over 200 items. The highest tax slab was retained only on 50 'sinful and luxury items' while nearly 177 items were rationalised from the highest tax slab to 18 percent. One of the most lauded moves during the 23rd GST Council meet was to bring restaurant bills under the 5 percent bracket from the earlier 18 percent. Though a lot of items turned cheaper, and affordable, after the GST was rolled out, there are, however, calls to bring other items such as petrol, diesel under the indirect tax regime in a bid to make them cheaper amid crude price hikes that have lately taken the fuel prices in domestic market to unprecedented levels in May this year.These Items saw price cuts during the 23rd GST meeting.

On June 15, when Swapan Debbarma and Somati saw that huge landslides following heavy rains had affected around a kilometre of the tracks, they decided to do something.""We knew if the train runs over, it will definitely stop. We thought if thousands of precious lives can be saved, then it was worth risking ours,"" 39-year-old Mr Debbarma told NDTV.Swapan and his nine-year-old daughter Somati were walking along the tracks in Ambassa, about 80 km from Agartala, when they noticed a missing section of the tracks. The duo sat there and waited for about two hours. When they saw a train, they got up and waved at the train.""That day, it was raining and we didn't have food at home. I went out with my daughter in search of fish. As we followed the railway track we noticed the damage. The train had to be stopped. As soon as we saw the train, I took off my shirt and waved, but it didn't stop. So we stood in the middle. Finally, the driver saw and stopped a few metres from us,"" he said.An amateur video of the incident made the Debbarmas famous. Cricketer Virender Sehwag tweeted praises for him. In Tripura, he is now known as ""Superman"" and God's incarnation.""That day God descended on him and he saved so many lives, that's what we believe,"" said Ratan Saha, a local from Ambassa in Dhalai district.""I have moved a resolution in the assembly that he should be considered for national bravery award,"" said Tripura Health Minister Sudip Roy Burman.When NDTV visited his dilapidated hut in Dhanchara, Swapan was busy arranging documents for a bank account -- his first, after he missed out on the government's Jan Dhan Yojna.Swapan couldn't study after class 4 because of extreme poverty. They brought firewood from the forest and sold it in the local market. The family didn't make more than Rs 60-70 a day.""So if there was rice then there was no salt, and if salt and oil were there, we didn't have rice,"" he said.""I don't have a MNREGA job card. I don't have a bank account. After the train incident, I was rewarded. But I didn't have a bank account to encash the cheque. Now people are helping me open an account,"" he added.Swapan is among thousands of poor and marginalised tribals in Tripura who don't have access to drinking water, electricity, or sustained livelihood.And despite his struggles, he didn't lose the path of humanity. In fact, he has set an example at a time when mob violence has taken several lives in Tripura and across the country."

(Representational)Noting that the conviction rate, investigations, prosecutions and convictions in India were ""disproportionately low"" relative to the scale of human trafficking, the US has continued to place the country in 'Tier 2' of its annual report on trade of humans.The US State Department in its annual Trafficking in Persons Report for 2018 urged India to increase prosecutions and convictions for all forms of trafficking, including forced and bonded labour, and of officials allegedly complicit in it.""The government of India does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period, therefore India remained on Tier 2,"" the department said.The Department places each country in this report onto one of four tiers, as mandated by The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) of the US.Tier-2 suggests that the government of the country does not fully meet the TVPA's minimum standards, but is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance with those standards.At the same time, the report said India has demonstrated increased efforts by nearly tripling the number of victims identified and increasing its budget for shelter programmes for female and child trafficking victims.It also noted that the government's inter-ministerial committee in 2017 to discuss and revise a draft anti-trafficking bill and India's border guard force along its Nepal border conducted several awareness activities on human trafficking for students and border communities.""However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Overall victim protection remained inadequate and inconsistent and the government sometimes penalised victims through arrests for crimes committed as a result of being subjected to human trafficking,"" it said.As reported over the past five years, the State Department said India is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking.Forced labour constitutes India's largest trafficking problem. Men, women, and children in debt bondage -- sometimes inherited from previous generations -- are forced to work in brick kilns, rice mills, embroidery factories and agriculture the report stated.Most of India's trafficking problem is internal and those from the most disadvantaged social strata -- lowest caste Dalits, members of tribal communities, religious minorities, and women and girls from excluded groups -- are most vulnerable according to the report.It added that within India, some are subjected to forced labour in sectors such as construction, steel, garment and textile industries, wire manufacturing for underground cables, biscuit factories, pickling, floriculture, fish farms and ship breaking.""Workers within India who mine for sand are potentially vulnerable to human trafficking. Thousands of unregulated work placement agencies reportedly lure adults and children under false promises of employment into sex trafficking or forced labour, including domestic servitude,"" the report stated.Observing that experts estimate millions of women and children are victims of sex trafficking in India, the report said traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages within India or Gulf states and subject women and girls to sex trafficking.""In addition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications,"" the report said. Since 2011, India has remained at Tier-2 of the State Department reports on human trafficking."

Those who are incapable of going to FPS should get ration at their doorsteps. Assign your staff for delivery. If you cannot carry out doorstep delivery, ask the beneficiaries to assign someone to receive the ration on their behalf.""An 11-year-old girl in Jharkhand's Simdega district had allegedly died of starvation last year as her family did not get foodgrain from the PDS shop as their ration card was not linked with the Aadhaar card.Mr Paswan said that about 81 crore persons in the country were getting foodgrain at subsidised rates -- rice at Rs 3 per kg, wheat at Rs 2 per kg and coarse grains at Re 1 per kg -- which will remained unchanged till 2019.""We have issued guidelines to the states. We have told them that there should not be any death due to starvation. The central government spends a huge sum of money to give up to 90 per cent subsidy on foodgrain,"" he told reporters later.Mr Paswan said that he welcomed the Delhi government's plan to deliver ration at the doorstep of intended beneficiaries but expressed concern about the FPS dealers.""It is a good thing that they want to deliver ration at the doorsteps. But what will happen to FPS dealers? If other states want to do it, it is welcome as we will be happy that the poor get ration at their homes,"" he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had this month held a protest at the Lieutenant Governor's office over the ""rejection"" of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme.Mr Paswan also said that sugarcane arrears had come down after the government took some measures, including a Rs 7,000 crore relief package to the sugar sector.Cane arrears had increased to Rs 22,654 crore as of June 1."

""It cannot happen overnight - we've got investments, we've got loans to pay and people to manage.""The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, whose members include online retailers such as Amazon India and Flipkart, said in a June 7 letter to the state government that such a ban ""will not be without its own share of adverse environmental impacts which are largely driven by issues associated with the use of alternatives"".The Internet and Mobile Association of India, which also counts Amazon and Flipkart as members, said it had asked the state to ease the rules but did not specify what relaxation it was seeking.Beverage makers such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola, meanwhile, want an exemption from the rules as they mandate a buyback of empty bottles at a guaranteed price, which will raise costs, another source familiar with the talks said.Amazon, Flipkart, Pepsi and Coca-Cola did not respond to requests for comment. H&M said in a statement that it supported reusing and recycling, adding that the company had asked the government to clarify the rules and for help coming up with solutions.Maharashtra's environment minister said Wednesday that the government would relax rules for neighbourhood grocery stores allowing them to pack commodities such as rice and pulses in plastic. They would, however, have to ensure buyers return the packaging for recycling.A senior official told Reuters the government could moderate some aspects of the rule for online retailers as well or give them more time to comply. Another official confirmed that issues raised by the industry was being looked into.Both officials declined to be named as the talks are not public.Enforcing ComplianceMaharashtra's plastic ban includes bags, food containers, spoons, forks, glasses and packaging wraps - which the local plastics industry says could cost it up to 150 billion rupees ($2.20 billion) a year and nearly 300,000 jobs.For online retailers, cost is one of the main issues.An e-commerce industry source said that packaging charges comprise about 2 percent to 3.5 percent of fulfilment costs - the price of shipping, delivery and compensating sellers for discounts - and that the use of biodegradable plastic or other alternatives could push these costs higher.Cardboard boxes, for example, could cost nearly a third more than plastic packing, according to industry estimates cited by the Economic Times daily.Since the ban came into force, squads of officials in Mumbai have been raiding shops and restaurants, sometimes accompanied by police, to enforce compliance.Violations could result in penalties of up to Rs 25,000 rupees and jail terms of up to three months.Nidhi Choudhari, Mumbai's deputy municipal commissioner, told Reuters it has collected more than 1.3 million rupees in penalties so far.Bharati Chaturvedi, founder of the Chintan environmental advocacy group in New Delhi, said she feared the plastics industry would use any compliance extensions to try to put off the ban indefinitely.""We should really have a hard ban,"" she said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have met twice since April, pledging to strengthen bilateral ties.Driving the marriage of convenience is Trump's unpredictable policy-making. The US has ratcheted up global trade tensions with tariff threats against China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, prompting several to retaliate. Last week India also joined the fray, raising duties on a slew of US imports.""China understands that this trade war situation isn't going to end in a few days or even months,"" said Bipul Chatterjee, executive director of an India-based trade think tank. ""They wouldn't want to open more than one battle front. The focus is now on confronting the US.""The question many observers are asking is whether China's cosier relationship with India can endure. The world's two most-populous nations have had a tense history, marked by border disputes and China's growing economic influence in South Asia.""I don't think the fundamentals of the relationship are changing in any way, but the Trump factor is pushing them to coordinate their priorities more closely,"" said Harsh Pant, an international relations professor at King's College London.Here's a look at some of the flashpoints that hinder stronger ties:India's two-way trade with China touched nearly $90 billion last year, making it the largest commercial partner of the South Asian economy. The bilateral trade gap was $63 billion -- India's largest -- mainly due to imports of Chinese-made heavy machinery, telecom equipment and home appliances, according to commerce ministry data.The deficit widened from $36 billion in the financial year ended March 2014, driving up the current-account gap and adding to the economy's vulnerability.Modi's flagship 'Make in India' initiative to foster local manufacturing struggles in the face of low-priced imports from China, while at the same time India's cost-competitive software services companies battle to get access to the Chinese market.To curb the shortfall -- and counter to China's easing of trade barriers -- India boosted tariffs on electronic goods, such as mobile phones, TVs and microwave ovens last year.Closer trade ties seem incongruous less than a year after troops from the two nuclear-armed nations faced off in a dispute in the remote Doklam Plateau between India, Bhutan and Tibet, triggered by China's attempt to build a road there.Tension eased after the two countries agreed to an ""expeditious disengagement"" of troops from the area in late August, with Modi and Xi later pledging to strengthen communication between their respective armies at the informal summit this April.Sino-Indian relations have long been marred by disputes over large tracts of land along the border. India's hosting of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile in the mountain town of Dharamsala in northern India is also a source of anger in Beijing.Under the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, China has financed ports and roads from Myanmar to Sri Lanka and Pakistan.Another sore point in the bilateral relationship has been China's ambitious global infrastructure plans, which include projects in New Delhi's Indian Ocean backyard that domestic analysts worry have a strategic dimension.Under the so-called Belt and Road Initiative, China has financed ports and roads from Myanmar to Sri Lanka and Pakistan. India is one of the only holdouts globally.At a recent foreign ministers meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a China-led group, India was the only member country not to endorse China's Belt and Road plans.Drawing the most alarm for India is the $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which runs through Pakistan-administered land in the disputed border region of Kashmir. New Delhi claims the region as its own territory."

Speaking at a meeting in Purulia -- once the heart of the state's Maoist zone -- the BJP chief launched an all-out attack on the two-time Chief Minister's government. Bengal, he pointed out, was given a sweet deal by the NDA government in terms of financial packages, still parts of the state does not have clean drinking water or electricity.""BJP distributes rice at Rs 2 a kg. Do the people in Purulia get it? Mamata is busy stitching a grand coalition.

Today you are dead."" On Saturday, the police made the first arrest in the cases.""More than 65 BJP workers were killed in the violence in Bengal and more than 1,341 workers were injured,"" Mr Shah said, adding that only the ""thugs"" of the TMC are thriving in the state. In the evening, he met the families of the men.Mr Shah, whose party has two parliamentary seats in Bengal, has set an ambitious target for his local leaders. He wants at least 22 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state - and there is no question of any understanding with Ms Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, which happens to be a pet allegation by the state leaders of the opposition Congress and the Left Front.State BJP chief Dilip Ghosh is confident. ""Amit Shah has set us a minimum 22 as the target. We will get many more,"" he told reporters. The state BJP's confidence is likely to stem from the recent panchayat poll elections. The party has outstripped the Left Front to become the main opposition in the state.The gap in BJP-TMC vote share is huge, but the BJP numbers are rising with every election.In the evening, senior Trinamool leader Partha Chatterjee said Amit Shah should pay more attention to his party's government at the Centre and states where assembly polls are due, instead of ""looking at"" West Bengal.""There is a saying that empty vessels make the greatest sound. Amit Shah's speech in Purulia is a reflection of it,"" Mr Chatterjee said."

Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy is finding it difficult to take even the first step in delivering on his mandate.While campaigning for the May 12 election, both Mr Kumaraswamy's party and the Congress had promised the big-ticket step of waiving farm loans.Mr Kumaraswamy has now said he would announce the details in a budget he would present on July 5. This has apparently rattled the man who handled finance earlier - Congress's former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.Siddaramaiah, who now heads the coalition coordination committee, has been caught hitting out at the Chief Minister in two videos apparently recorded at a naturopathy retreat where he spent some days earlier this month.In one video, he is seen speaking skeptically about the Kumaraswamy government completing its five-year term. ""They (government) will remain until parliament elections are over, after that, what all developments will happen (we will have to see),"" Siddaramaiah added.Mr Siddaramaiah's ties with the JDS, the party he quit in 2006 to join the Congress, has been strained.The second video recording, also shown on a local channel, has him questioning the need for a fresh budget since the JDS is in a coalition with the Congress, which presented the last one.""When the common minimum programme of the two parties has not yet been prepared, why prepare for a new budget,"" he is heard asking.Siddaramaiah also reportedly referred to his party colleague and Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara as having said it was common for a new government to have a new budget.The relationship between Siddaramaiah and Mr Parameshwara, the state Congress chief, has long been strained.So has Mr Siddaramaiah's ties with the JDS, the party he quit in 2006 to join the Congress.The former Chief Minister is in an awkward space; an active politician who no longer occupies centrestage after the party he led could not come back to power on its own. The role of heading the coordination committee may not be compensation enough.Reports suggest he is the go-to man for Congress leaders upset with the terms of the coalition.Mr Kumaraswamy has indirectly acknowledged the dissatisfaction of some Congress leaders. While talking to officials of nationalised and cooperative banks on Monday he said, ""I am the kind of person who likes for everyone to cooperate and work together as a family. Even officers are asking how long this government will last. Some are saying, do the new budget after the parliamentary elections, not now. It is not important how long I stay. It is important what I can do for the people in that time."" For weeks after Mr Kumaraswamy's oath ceremony, the allies couldn't agree on the distribution of ministries and fought for the finance portfolio until Congress president Rahul Gandhi stepped in. Mr Kumaraswamy kept the portfolio and now fully intends to present a new budget, especially before the 2019 national polls.At the first meeting of the coordination committee earlier this month, the partners had reportedly agreed that the flagship programmes of the previous Congress government would continue - like rice at Rs one rupee a kg under the Anna Bhagya scheme and the low-cost Indira Canteens."

The most affected places are Kottayam and Alappuzha.A team of National Disaster and Relief Force had moved to Kottayam to aid in evacuation operations from the low lying areas. Another team has now been sent to Alappuzha. Rescue operations are in full swing in Kuttanad where almost all roads have turned into rivers.Another team is on stand by in Kottayam, for any distress calls.Most roads have been completely submerged in Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala. District officials are relying on boats to ensure evacuation and relief materials. Most shops are shut in Kuttanad.""We have ensured medical help through floating dispensaries. I have ordered for ration shops to be fully stocked and anyone can come to get their stock, irrespective of their card. Situation is under control but we hope that the water flow from Kottayam, Pathanamthita will lessen further. Relief camps have been set up across Alappuzha,"" District Collector S Suhas told NDTV.Around 39 people have lost their lives, and 10 are missing due to in rain related accidents, since July 9. Over 564 relief camps have been opened, out of which the maximum (194) are in Alappuzha.In Kottayam, while evacuation operations are mostly over, 1/3rd of the district remains inundated. Locals say it is the worst flood since 1994. In many places, residents have refused to be evacuated.""How can we leave everything at home and go away. It's our hard earned money. We have to take care of stuff at home,"" said Sushila who is among a group of 70 people who got food and water from a NDRF team. The team had waded through waist deep water with a motorless boat for around 4 kms to reach the people."

Output from agriculture, construction industries also fell by 1.3 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively.""The sanctions were stronger in 2017 than they were in 2016,"" Shin Seung-cheol, head of the BOK's National Accounts Coordination Team said.""External trade volume fell significantly with the exports ban on coal, steel, fisheries and textile products. It's difficult to put exact numbers on those but it (export bans) crashed industrial production,"" Shin said.The steep economic downturn comes as analysts highlight the need for the isolated country to shift towards economic development.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in April vowed to switch the country's strategic focus from the development of its nuclear arsenal to emulating China's ""socialist economic construction"".""As long as exports of minerals are part of the sanctions, by far the most profitable item of its exports, Pyongyang will have no choice but to continue with its current negotiations with the U.S. (to remove the sanctions),"" said Kim Byeong-yeon, an economics professor at the Seoul National University with expertise in the North Korean economy.North Korea's coal-intensive industries and manufacturing sectors have suffered as the UN Security Council ratcheted up the sanctions in response to years of nuclear tests by Pyongyang.China, its biggest trading partner, enforced sanctions strictly in the second half of 2017, hurting North Korea's manufacturing sector. Beijing's suspended coal purchases last year cut North Korea's main export revenue source while its suspended fuel sales to the reclusive state sparked a surge in gasoline and diesel prices, data reviewed by Reuters showed earlier.""This year will be a lot worse. Shrinking trade first hits the Kim regime and top officials, and then later affects unofficial markets,"" said Kim at Seoul National University, adding that a reduction in tradable goods would eventually decrease household income and private consumption.North Korea's black market, or Jangmadang, has grown to account for about 60 percent of the economy, and is where individuals and wholesalers buy and sell Chinese-made consumer goods or agricultural products, according to the Institute for Korean Integration of Society.China's total trade with North Korea dropped 59.2 percent in the first half of 2018 from a year earlier, China's customs data showed last week. The BOK uses figures compiled by the government and spy agencies to make its economic estimates. The bank's survey includes monitoring of the size of rice paddy crops in border areas, traffic surveillance, and interviews with defectors. North Korea does not publish economic data.North Korea's Gross National Income per capita stands at 1.46 million won ($1,283.52), making it about 4.4 percent the size of South Korea's, the BOK said. Overall exports from North Korea dropped 37.2 percent in 2017, marking the biggest fall since a 38.5 percent decline in 1998, the BOK said on Friday, citing data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency.

Dubai's economy roared back and has grown by a third since then, buoyed by foreign trade, tourism and its status as the main regional hub for business services.Now, however, Dubai is hitting another rough patch. Residential property prices have dropped by more than 15 percent since late 2014 and are still falling. The stock market is down 13 percent this year, the worst performance in the region.Dubai issued 4,722 new business licences in the second quarter of 2018, down 26 percent from the same period in 2016, the year when new licences peaked.View of Burj Khalifa the tallest building from the Business Bay area in Dubai, UAE July 8, 2018.The falls may be temporary, the result of an economic slowdown in the Gulf caused by low oil prices. But other figures suggest some of Dubai's traditional growth engines are losing steam, which could mean a long-term slump.Growth in passenger traffic through Dubai's international airport has fallen to near zero this year, after 15 years of strong increases. Increasingly long-range aircraft may loosen Dubai's dominance as a travel hub connecting Asia and Europe.Official data shows Dubai's population continuing to expand, by 3.5 percent to 3.08 million in the first half of 2018. But most growth in recent years has been in lower-paid construction and services jobs, not in higher-paid white-collar posts.""Perhaps the era when one could move to Dubai to make one's wealth is passing,"" said Hasnain Malik, Dubai-based global head of equity research and strategy at Exotix Capital.He said the city was increasingly attractive as a base for rich people from around the world who wished to enjoy their wealth.A visitor looks at the aerial view of Dubai from the Deira old Dubai side in Dubai, UAE July 9, 2018.But it is not clear that Dubai's transport industries and business zones can continue growing fast enough to attract, and retain, the number of foreign white-collar workers needed to support demand in its real estate market, Malik said.STRUCTURAL CHALLENGESEconomists see little risk of another financial crisis; after restructuring billions of dollars of debt, Dubai's state-linked companies are less leveraged than they were a decade ago.Nor has headline economic growth slowed greatly. International Monetary Fund officials have estimated gross domestic product will expand over 3 percent this year.""The emirate continues to attract businesses and investors as a competitive hub for sustainable business development,"" Dubai's Department of Economic Development said in a statement this week, adding that licensing figures showed ""continued investment in all vital economic sectors in Dubai"".But much of this year's growth is due to a big rise in state spending as Dubai builds infrastructure to host the Expo 2020 world's fair; its 2018 budget soared 19.5 percent from 2017 to a record 56.6 billion dirhams ($15.4 billion). The government cannot keep boosting spending at that speed indefinitely.Jim Krane, energy fellow at Rice University in Texas and author of ""City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism"", said the emirate faced structural challenges including an increasingly tough geopolitical environment.In the past, Dubai thrived by keeping cordial relations with every country in the region, accepting trade and investment from all of them.That has become impossible. Last year, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other countries cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, ending Dubai's role as a base for business with the small but super-rich country.Goods that were once shipped to Qatar via Dubai now move via other countries, such as Oman or India; multinational firms use their European or U.S. offices, not their Dubai operations, to handle business with Qatar.Meanwhile, the United States and Gulf allies, including the UAE, are trying to squeeze Iran's economy by reducing its financial and trade ties. The effort is more aggressive than Washington's previous attempt to isolate Iran several years ago, diplomats in the region say.That matters because the UAE's exports and re-exports to Iran, the vast majority via Dubai, totalled $19.9 billion in 2017.The chief executive of a foreign financial firm in Dubai said the emirate faced unprecedented competition from neighbouring countries for capital, as low oil prices forced those countries to develop their own non-oil industries.Portfolio funds are already flowing from Dubai's stock market to Saudi Arabia's bourse. In coming years, direct investment may follow; U.S. oilfield services firm McDermott International has said it expects to move business slowly from Dubai's Jebel Ali Port to a new Saudi facility by the mid-2020s.Dubai is trying to shore up its competitive position. In the last few months the government has said it will reduce municipal fees, scrap some aviation charges, freeze school costs and take other steps to aid foreign firms and residents.Potentially the most far-reaching reform was announced by the UAE cabinet, chaired by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. It promised to permit 100 percent foreign ownership of some UAE-based businesses, up from the current 49 percent limit, and grant long-term residency visas of up to 10 years to foreign investors and some professionals.That could make foreign investment in Dubai more attractive and, by helping foreigners plan on long-term residence in the emirate, encourage them to buy homes.But details of the new policy have not been released, and implementing it may be tricky. ""Free zones"" in Dubai already permit 100 percent foreign ownership; they could suffer if they no longer have that right exclusively. And many UAE citizens make money as silent partners with foreign businessmen.""To some extent, the economy is based on people renting out their passports - disrupting that could cause economic pain among the local population,"" the financial executive said.

In Kottayam 17,034 people were in 110 camps.A Navy release said disaster relief teams comprising 30 personnel from the Southern Naval Command reached out to areas cut-off by flood waters in Kuttanad and in some parts of Kottayam district.The Navy team also cleared the clogged waterways and created outlet for the floodwater, the release added.Even though the rains have subsided, the worst flood that affected the Kuttanad region has made life miserable for thousands of stranded people."

""The CBF has renewed the contract with coach Tite until the end of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar,"" wrote the CBF on its website. Tite is the first coach of the Brazil national team to be re-appointed after a World Cup elimination since Claudio Coutinho in 1978. Brazil, with superstar Neymar in their ranks , were regarded as one of the favourites for the 2018 World Cup but they were knocked out in the last-eight , losing 2-1 to Belgium .""The federation has given us the conditions to build an environment of unity and professionalism, it's a great challenge and we are happy to face it, already focused on our next matches and competitions,"" Tite said in a statement.Tite's first challenge will be to win the Copa America in 2019 when Brazil hosts the tournament.Brazil will begin their post-World Cup rehabilitation with a series of friendlies, the first of which is against the United States in New Jersey on September 7.""The CBF is investing in a long-term project to guarantee the staff six-and-a-half-years in charge of La Selecao, and we believe that this careful planning will bring to Brazilian football the results we expect,"" said Rogerio Caboclo, the executive director of the CBF.Adenor Leonardo Bacchi, who is universally known by his nickname Tite, took over the Brazil job in June 2016 and immediately faced a daunting task.The team under Dunga, who'd been fired, were an embarrassment. And Dunga himself had been hired in 2014 to resurrect a team reeling from the ultimate humilation of that 7-1 loss to Germany in the semi-finals of the World Cup on Brazilian soil.By the time Tite took over, Brazil had already played a third of their qualifying games for the 2018 tournament and Tite wondered whether he'd have time to turn the slow-motion disaster around.Immediately after getting the job, ""I said to myself... 'What if I don't manage to qualify?'"" he told TV Globo recently.Tite, 57, says his wife Rose looked at him in concern. ""I can't figure out what you're thinking,"" she said.But the devout Catholic, who has a shrine to the Virgin Mary in his office, did more than just sort out his thoughts.In seven months he pulled the team from the brink and turned them into winners, comfortably topping the South American qualifying group.Tite's emotional and eloquent way of talking and his father-figure status in the dressing room were key in healing the mental scars of talented, young players who'd known so many setbacks.Tite didn't have to make wholesale changes to the squad -- he only had to bring out the best in what he already had.A fan of typical Brazilian rice and beans, washed down with the potent cachaca-based cocktail caipirinha, Tite admitted he cried for a week after the 2014 loss to Germany, when he waited in vain for a call from the Brazilian Football Confederation to take over.""When I wasn't chosen... I felt frustrated, angry and very sad,"" he said. ""But right then I thought of my mother. She was a fighter. Whenever our family had problems, she'd start working even harder,"" he told The Players' Tribune."

Among the issues they will discuss are exports of soya, sugar and non-basmati rice and they will also look at the possible import of urea from China,"" he said.Prime Minister Modi also mentioned about the pharma sector and cited a Chinese movie titled 'Dying to Survive' which is based loosely on the role that the Indian cancer drugs play in saving the life of the main character of the movie, Mr Gokhale said, adding that it was decided that an Indian pharmaceutical delegation will visit Shanghai, China on August 21 and 22 for talks.Xi said that as major emerging market economies, as well as vindicators and contributors of the current international order, China and India should strengthen bilateral cooperation, while exploring a new model for regional cooperation, upholding multilateralism, championing economic globalization and striving for a more just and rational international order, Xinhua reported.President Xi and Prime Minister Modi will meet again at the margins of the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of this year."

Mamata had done many things for the Hindus, including developing Gangasagar, building skywalk at Dakshineswar temple and renovating Tarakeswar temple,"" he said.Mr Bandopadhyay claimed that although the highest number of farmer deaths were reported in Maharashtra during the past six months, PM Modi chose to hold a rally for welfare of peasants in Bengal where not a single farmer had died.Accusing the BJP of creating a rift between the Hindus and the Muslims, he said, ""We will not let that happen"".""The Rambhakts of Modi's BJP trigger riots but the Rambhakts of Bengal work for building communal amity,"" he claimed.He claimed that the turnout at PM Modi's public rally comprised people from four states - Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha -- but not a single farmer was present at the rally.Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim said, ""The people of India need Mamata Banerjee. She has no lust for power. But she has to take up the responsibility. The people of the country need a leader who works for everybody.""He said PM Modi had raised a slogan of bringing ""Achhe din"" but bad days befell the people.Mr Hakim, who is also the Trinamool Congress' general secretary, said, ""We have syndicate for development but not formed syndicate to organise riots like what happened in Gujarat.""He claimed that the Trinamool Congress would win all the 42 seats in the state and the BJP would not be able to win a single seat.State Education Minister and Trinamool Congress Secretary General Partha Chatterjee alleged that PM Modi was shedding crocodile tears for the farmers.""Modi had suddenly turned up in Midnapore to profess his new-found love for farmers. I ask where was he when the farmers' agitation in Nandigram and Singur were taking place,"" he questioned.Mr Chatterjee said Ms Banerjee had a history of standing by the people and she did not become a mass leader in one day.He said those who failed to provide mid-day meal rice were now claiming to side with the farmers.Mr Chatterjee alleged that the BJP was trying to win polls by bringing out rath-yatras and allowing display of swords in processions, thereby, creating fear among people but, said that, they would not succeed."

The final program could be one of these or a combination of all three.The plan for the handout comes soon after the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was voted out in key state elections this month, forcing Modi to draw up a course correction before federal polls due by May. The government, which has already exceeded the annual budget gap aim, has little room for spending in the current year, having forgone some tax revenue on goods and services following the defeat.The income support program involves a certain amount as monthly payout to farmers and could benefit as many as 150 million farm households, a key bloc that can influence the election outcome.Distress SalesIn July, the government raised support prices of crops such as cotton, soybeans and paddy rice to ensure farmers get at least 50 per cent more than the estimated production costs. While that has largely failed to shield farmers from distress sales due to lack of sufficient state procurement, the government now plans to pay cash to farmers if their produce sells at a discount to the government-set rates.Another alternative being considered is a revamp of the crop insurance program. The changes could include a reduction in premium paid by farmers, inclusion of more crops to avail state incentives and bringing tenant farmers under the cover.Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik didnt respond to two calls made to his mobile phone. An agriculture ministry spokeswoman declined to comment.Modi, who is seeking a second term, has to win over farmers before the election. They have been hit by falling crop prices and rising input costs, forcing them to hit the streets seeking debt waivers and protection from distress sales. Add to it, the pressure from opposition Indian National Congress which waived off farm loans after wresting power from the BJP in three states earlier this month.The income support program could help reduce poverty in a country thats home to a third of the worlds poor and still spends less than 2 per cent of its gross domestic product on social security.With the government already exceeding its budgeted annual deficit in October, any sops will need to be balanced with possible reductions in spending to achieve the fiscal gap target of 3.3 per cent of gross domestic product."

Sluice gates that enable shrimp farming can be opened only after November 15, and their operation will have to be conducted under the supervision of the Irrigation Department. Shrimp farmers have to obtain proper licences for their farming activities, which have to be wound up by April 15.According to Francis Kalathungal of the Pokkali Samrakshana Samiti, this would be help pokkali paddy farmers in the area who have been facing low harvests over the past few years (primarily due to the early commencement of the shrimp farming season, which necessitates letting in saline water into paddy fields). While the increased salinity is ideal for the shrimps, the pokkali rice plants (which are at different stages of flowering and fruiting at this time) suffer, affecting paddy production.With shrimps now emerging as an important export item, farming them has become more lucrative than pokkali paddy cultivation, he said. Government policies that offer more subsidies for pisciculture have also played a role in this trend.As a result, the traditional timelines for pokkali and shrimp or fish farming in these rice fields have taken a hit. Traditionally, fields are emptied of salt water by April 15 and dried. The first summer showers that arrive soon after wash away any remaining salt. By the time the southwest monsoon hits the area in June, the fields are ready to receive pokkali saplings and paddy cultivation begins in the low-saline conditions. By late October-early November, pokkali rice is harvested; shrimp cultivation commences in the same fields under high saline conditions and ends by next April. However, currently, leases for shrimp farming are available at the beginning of July itself, permitting shrimp farmers (who take the pokkali paddies on lease) to let in salt water. Hence we were able to harvest paddy only from three acres of the 220 acres of cultivable land within the Maruvakkad padasekharam this year, said Mr. Kalathungal, who also cultivates five acres of paddy in the area.But this could change if the new orders are implemented properly, said Chandu M.M., an award-winning pokkali farmer. The new orders regulating shrimp cultivation are strong and I hope they will be implemented not just in Maruvakkad but the entire pokkali-growing area in the State soon, said Mr. Chandu. These rules should also be made legally binding and defaulters should be pulled up. It would also be ideal if leases for shrimp farming are not be given before October, Mr. Kalathungal said.The High Court ruled that auction of paddy at Maruvakkad for shrimp farming shall not be done before November every year"

The State Soil Survey and Soil Conservation Department has come up with an e-age solution which reduces the waiting time to the blink of an eye. Well, almost.The department, with the help of Technopark-based IIITM-K, has developed a GPS-aided app that provides farmers with data on the soil and customised suggestions regarding fertilizer and crop use. Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar launched the app  Mannine Ariyaam Mobileiloode (MAM)  at the VAIGA 2018 expo in Thrissur on Sunday. On Google Playstore, the app will be available as Mannu, Malayalam for soil, Soil Survey and Soil Conservation director Justin Mohan said..Entire State by AprilInitially, the app will provide soil data in Thrissur district. We have fed in soil data compiled from the district on the geospatial system. We plan to cover the entire State by March 31, 2019, Mr. Mohan said.The app is quite simple to use. All the farmer needs to do is install the app on his mobile phone, position himself on his farmland and click on the icon, said Sudheesh Kumar, Assistant Director, Soil Survey and Soil Conservation Department, and project coordinator. The app will automatically pinpoint the location and supply data on pH value of the soil, nutrient content such as the quantity of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, the presence of other elements and soil structure, Mr. Sudheesh Kumar said.What makes the app attractive is that it promises farmers tailor-made recommendations regarding crop and fertilizer use gleaned from Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) recommendations. For the paddy crop, for example, the farmer will be asked to supply details such as acreage and rice variety. In effect, the farmer stands to get a customised recommendations regarding crop cultivation and fertilizer use. If its an organic farm, then the recommendations will be suited to that particular system. Mr Sudheesh Kumar said.Future referenceAll data will be stored for future reference, offering considerable help in understanding changes in soil over a period of time. Or, for instance, after events such as floods. The department had announced the project last year and piloted it in one panchayat in Thrissur district. Plans to release it on World Soil Day this year, December 5, however, had not worked out."

Yuvasenthilkumar, a post-graduate in organic agriculture, near Modakurichi in Tamil Nadu, used to raise paddy varieties such as IR 20 and ADT 38 on his two-acre farm till 2012.Having developed an interest in native varieties  specifically, ones that grow without the use of fertilizers  he went on a quest for almost a year looking for such paddy varieties. He tried cultivating varieties from the delta areas. However, the yield was not satisfactory. Then, he learnt from elders in his locality that before the 1970s, they used to grow varieties such as Tiruchengode Sambha and Ayan Sambha. However, the seeds for these varieties were not available locally.In 2014, he got 50 gm of seed imported by the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University from the International Rice Research Institute, Manila, for each of the 33 varieties native to the middle Cauvery basin.The seeds were tried out and it was decided to go in for Tiruchengode Sambha and Ayan Sambha.In four years, 45 acres belonging to 12 farmers came under the Tiruchengode Sambha native variety of rice in the Erode-Kodumudi-Tiruchengode belt. Last year, the variety was grown on 11 acres for commercial use. The average yield per acre was 1,700 kg and it was a 135-day crop. We do not use even green manure, he said. This year, this variety of paddy would be raised on 33.8 acres for commercial purposes.Farmers are able to get viable price for this rice in the market. One of the advantages for them is that they do not have to spend on fertilizers or pesticides. The paddy straw, got after the harvest, is almost double the quantity compared with the normal varieties, he said.One more varietyMr. Yuvasenthilkumar and a group of his friends formed the River Basin Foundation in 2014 mainly to promote the native varieties. This year, they have sown Ayan Sambha on one acre on a trial basis.According to B. Shivakumar, who grows several traditional varieties of vegetables on 12 of his 70-acre farm in Sathyamangalam, yield in terms of number of vegetables per kg is higher in these varieties.For instance, one kg of traditional brinjal will have 40 to 45 pieces against 18 to 20 in a hybrid variety grown with chemicals. The nutritional value is high in these varieties of vegetables and farmers will gain in the medium to long term, he says."

5ce50c81e8e3fc56af4099fc,Books are about to be unbound,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/books-are-about-to-be-unbound/cid/1680435,2018-12-31,"Nearly a century ago, the publisher Alfred A. Knopf released a slim book of spiritual fables by an obscure Lebanese-American poet and painter named Kahlil Gibran.Knopf had modest expectations, and printed around 1,500 copies. Much to his surprise, the book  titled The Prophet  took off. It became a huge hit, and went on to sell more than 9 million copies in North America alone.Until now, the publishing house that still bears Knopfs name has held the North American copyright on the title. But that will change on January 1, when The Prophet enters the public domain, along with works by thousands of other artists and writers, including Marcel Proust, Willa Cather, D.H. Lawrence, Agatha Christie, Joseph Conrad, Edith Wharton, P.G. Wodehouse, Rudyard Kipling, Katherine Mansfield, Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens.This coming year marks the first time in two decades that a large body of copyrighted works will lose their protected status  a shift that will have profound consequences for publishers and literary estates, which stand to lose both money and creative control.But it will also be a boon for readers, who will have more editions to choose from, and for writers and other artists who can create new works based on classic stories without getting hit with an intellectual property lawsuit.Books are going to be available in a much wider variety now, and theyre going to be cheaper, said Imke Reimers, an assistant professor of economics at Northeastern University who has studied the impact of copyright. Consumers and readers are definitely going to benefit from this.The sudden deluge of available works traces back to legislation Congress passed in 1998, which extended copyright protections by 20 years. The law reset the copyright term for works published from 1923 to 1977  lengthening it from 75 years to 95 years after publication  essentially freezing their protected status. (The law is often referred to by sceptics as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act since it has kept Steamboat Willie, the first Disney film featuring Mickey, under copyright until 2024.)Now that the term extension has run out, the spigot has been turned back on. Each January will bring a fresh crop of novels, plays, music and movies into the public domain. Over the next few years, the impact will be particularly dramatic, in part because the 1920s were such a fertile and experimental period for western literature, with the rise of masters like F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and Virginia Woolf.Eventually, these books belong to the people, said James L.W. West III, a Fitzgerald scholar. We can have new attempts to edit and reinterpret all of these iconic texts.Once books become part of the public domain, anyone can sell a digital, audio or print edition on Amazon. Fans can publish and sell their own sequels and spin-offs, or release irreverent monster mash-ups like the 2009 best-seller Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.Theatre and film producers can adapt the works into movies, plays and musicals without having to secure rights. Rival publishing houses can issue new print editions, and scholars can publish new annotated versions and interpretations. Free digital copies will circulate online. At the start of the new year, Google Books, which has more than 30 million works scanned in its vast online digital library, will release full digital editions of works published in 1923, among them Edgar Rice Burroughss Tarzan and the Golden Lion.Its difficult to say exactly how many works will enter the public domain this January, because some authors and publishers allowed their copyright to lapse, and some foreign-language books first published overseas in 1923 may remain under copyright for now, like Felix Saltens Bambi. More than 130,000 copyright registrations were filed in 1923 for various creative works, but most of those were not renewed, according to John Mark Ockerbloom, a digital library strategist at the University of Pennsylvania.Kahlil Gibran Wikimedia CommonsSome publishers and the writers heirs fear that losing copyright protections will lead to inferior editions with typos and other errors, and to derivative works that damage the integrity of iconic stories.Publishers are right to be concerned about a proliferation of unreliable editions, some of them probably not very good, said John Kulka, the editorial director of Library of America, a non-profit organisation that publishes American literary classics.Still, many scholars and legal experts argue that American copyright law, which is mind-numbingly complex, has skewed towards enriching companies and the heirs of writers and artists at the expense of the public. When the first Copyright Act was passed in the US in 1790, the maximum term was 28 years. Over the decades, lawmakers repeatedly prolonged the terms, which now stretch to over a century for many works.Some studies show that extending copyright can actually have a negative impact on the sales and availability of books. A few years ago, Paul J. Heald, a law professor at the University of Illinois, used software that randomly sampled books available on Amazon, and discovered that there were more new editions of books published in the 1910s than from titles published in the 2000s.Publishers often stop printing books that arent selling, but still retain the copyright, so no one else can release new editions. Once the books enter the public domain, a wider variety of new editions become available again, filling in a hole in the public and cultural record.For readers and book buyers, the proliferation of competing texts and editions will mean more selection and cheaper books. In 2019, the digital publisher Open Road Media is publishing around a dozen newly available works from 1923, including e-books of Gibrans The Prophet, Sigmund Freuds The Ego and the Id, Wodehouses The Inimitable Jeeves and Christies The Murder on the Links, one of her early novels featuring the detective Hercule Poirot."

Anbalagan had formed a core team led by Joint Director of Agriculture K. B. Jayanthi. Almost all Agricultural Officers and Assistant Agricultural Officers were roped in to bring as many paddy fields as possible under the SRI cultivation and it has brought about a significant improvement in area coverage.During the current samba season, a total of 11,135 hectares have so far been brought under the paddy cultivation as against the target of 17,050 hectares. Of the 11,135 hectares, paddy crop has been raised on 8,546 hectares under the System of Rice Intensification method. It is more than 70% of actual paddy cultivated area.It is a significant achievement. SRI is a proven method of paddy cultivation to maximise yield with less water and overhead. It is a good sign that farmers are ready to shun the traditional method of cultivation to adopt modern methods, says Mr. Anbalagan.Ms. Jayanthi said that as against the normal practice of transplanting paddy in about 30 days, transplantation under SRI could be carried out in 14 days. The method could reduce water use by 30 to 40%. As against 20 kg of seeds for raising nurseries under the traditional method, just three kg of seeds was enough to raise paddy on an acre. She said line planting would ensure quality tillers and good aeration. Sufficient spacing between seedlings would keep pest attacks under check. It was easy to clear weeds by cono-weeder. Ms. Jayanthi said that efforts would be taken to bring almost all farmers of system and lift irrigation in the district under the SRI method next year.L. P. Subramanian, a farmer of Uppidamangalam, said that he had raised TKM-13, a medium term paddy variety, on an acre of land. Proper aeration and spacing between seedlings had enabled healthy growth of paddy crop and had reduced the usage of fertilizers and pesticide."

Or so says the 30-year-old, who is an MBA student at Harvard Business School, US.Neel was working in Lisbon, Portugal, when he came across an organisation called Refood. It collected surplus food from restaurants and communities and distributed it amongst the hungry. He says, I was enamoured by how simple and doable this was, especially in a place like India, where hunger is a far more rampant problem.Upon returning home to India, Neel got in touch with his friend, Anand Sinha, and the two decided to hit the ground running. Their first food drive was under the Hauz Khas flyover in Delhi  they served food to 150 people.Neel says he and Anand realised the very first day that serving people once a week might be good for the conscience but it would not really make a difference. And that is when they decided to build and plan Robin Hood Army like a start-up  with goals, metrics, plans and division of work. Today, the organisation functions across 12 countries, 103 cities, enlists 21,588 volunteers and has fed roughly 92,59,380 people to date.Within a month of the launch, Neel and Anand were joined by Aarushi Batra, who fuelled the mission using social media. Today, Robin Hood Army uses social media extensively to spread the word, engage more volunteers, tie up with restaurants and spread awareness about its activities.Apart from social media, there is a dedicated expansion team constantly coaching new leaders to take the model to their cities.What started from Hauz Khas in Delhi has spread to Mumbai, Bangalore, Jaipur, Jabalpur. And there are chapters in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Philippines and Mexico too.Among Robin Hood Armys merry and very dedicated men and women  they call themselves Robins  are students, corporates, lawyers, doctors and restaurateurs. Ours is a hyperlocal neighbourhood model, says Neel. He proceeds to explain how a big city like Mumbai, for purposes of efficacy, would be divided into a certain number of hyperlocal chapters. Thereafter, in a particular chapter  Bandra, for example  food sourced only from restaurants in Bandra would be served by the robins to the less fortunate in the same area.Is such a sprawling giant thing based only on collective goodwill? Are there no profits involved?Says Neel, Forget profits, there is no money involved. The Robin Hood Army is also apolitical, it is essentially a platform that brings out the best of humanity using food as a medium.School children in Pakistans Qayyumabad eating meals made possible by the organisation Sourced by The TelegraphZero funds, zero profit, apolitical  so what does being a founder member of such a venture entail? The primary responsibility Aarushi and I have is to grow the platform. We spend a major portion of our time identifying the right people in different cities to start Robin Hood Army, coaching and mentoring them, and then making sure they have the right tools to join the fold, he says and is not forthcoming on any more detail thereafter.What is known, however, is that Robin Hood Army is largely decentralised; cities and city chapters coordinate via WhatsApp and other social media platforms and engage the community to serve those who need it most.We also organise nationwide campaigns. For example, on Independence Day, Robin Hood Army tied up with corporates, media houses and restaurants to serve food to 1.99 million needy people across the country, says Neel.Scrolling down the Facebook page of Robin Hood Army, one can see photographs of Robins playing, teaching, interacting with children in Warangal, Jalandhar, Indore, Raipur, Jamshedpur, Agartala, Meerut.There are photographs from Pakistans Qayyumabad, too, of little girls in white hijabs and blue kurtas sitting on wooden benches and eating rice with intent expressions. There are other pictures too; of picnics, games, medical camps. Says Neel, While serving meals is a major part of what we do, we also try to get to know the people we serve and spread smiles.Food for thought."

The Punjabi dhaba with its affordable price point will definitely be popular but modern Indian restaurants with regional Indian themes in a contemporary ambience are going to make waves next year. We already have Indian Accent in Delhi on the upper scale (which now has branches in New York and London), the Bengali restaurant Club de Bohemian in Calcutta, and O Pedro and The Bombay Canteen in Mumbai. On the more approachable level, you have Maratha Samrat in Pune and Gunpowder in Goa.Food trucksAfter the film Chef, all of a sudden there were food trucks everywhere, wanting to sell everything from kathi rolls to stir-fries and sundaes. If youre from Bombay, you may remember Hungry Eyes which used to be a food truck parked near The Oberoi in the 80s, selling noodles and fried rice throughout the day and night (especially popular after a night of drinking). Obviously, food trucks have been around, but it wasnt until the movie glamorised the whole concept that it became popular. The only thing that seems to hamper the growth is municipal permissions and the hygiene factor. Its only a matter of time.After the film Chef, all of a sudden there were food trucks everywhere A still from the movieFoodpreneursIndia is becoming quite the gastronomy centre of South Asia with many young entrepreneurs starting new food ventures. I also notice at our Markets (farmers markets by Karen Anand) that a lot of corporate honchos are leaving their ladders to fame and fortune (not to mention long hours of work and stress) to start on a path to a foodie dream.This is definitely a trend Ive seen over the last couple of years  young people working together to start a food truck or a granola business, for example. Some of the names that come to mind are The Cheese Truck (Pune), Bites of Bliss (Mumbai), Bombay Hemp Co. (Mumbai) and The Spotted Cow Fromagerie (Mumbai).Black Truffle Brie from The Spotted Cow Fromagerie Source: The Spotted Cow FromagerieCoffee barsCafe Coffee Day, which started in 1996 on Brigade Road in Bangalore, now has several hundred branches across India. It also has branches in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Malaysia. This was followed by Barista and, more recently, Starbucks. The emergence of local, round-the-corner cafes, all serving lattes, cappuccinos and Italian-style espresso and macchiato  as well as a range of cold coffees and teas  almost makes me feel that we were born to a coffee culture. I saw this trend in Singapore 20 years ago, also a predominantly tea-drinking market like us. I wondered when it was going to hit India. Its not just about coffee, its also about the ambience, the cool vibe and the sheer selection on offer, both cold and hot. Tea doesnt have the same effect. I dont see it being as phenomenally successful as coffee.We've warmed up to coffee culture Image: iStockIce cream explosionArtisanal, local flavours, real fruit are now the buzzwords in ice cream. Its a pity that nobody has resurrected the old-fashioned kulfi; its so difficult to get good kulfi made in hygienic surroundings. But the popularity and willingness to pay a hefty price for these ice creams emphasises our love for all things sweet.Artisanal, local flavours, real fruit are now the buzzwords in ice cream Image: iStockFruit cidersCider originated in England, especially in the West Country, and was all about fermented apple juice. However, theoretically, any fruit juice can be fermented and made into a mildly alcoholic drink, which can range from flat to slightly sparkling. Health enthusiasts have now started other fruit ciders. It began with pears and now stretches to strawberries and varieties of apples and berries. We even have our own fruit cider brand in India called Fruzzante in the Dahanu-Gholvad area making ciders from local chikoo, pineapple and mango.Fruit cider brand Fruzzante makes cider from local fruits like chikoo, pineapple and mango Image: FruzzantePatisserieI have been saying this a couple of years now: There has been a significant rise in the quality of patisserie and cakes. Driven by a large number of young people, especially girls, who have invested time and a great deal of money in studying in schools like Le Cordon Bleu and returning to India, nozzle and spatula in hand, ready to make us eat more sugar! A lot of these people are so passionate about what they do  a great mix of artistry and skill  it makes them and what they do so adorable and addictive.There has been a significant rise in the quality of patisserie and cakes. Image: iStockRose winesRoses used to be what the British liked to call quaffing wines  something you would drink on a hot summers day, light and lacking any depth and something that would give you a headache if you drank too much. They were not considered serious wines till quite recently when many good winemakers in the region of Provence in the south of France decided to pay more attention to this variety because of growing international demand.Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitts rose from their Provence estate Chateau Miraval made waves in 2012 when it was produced and sold on the international market. It raised the bar for the rose wine. Jon Bon Jovi also helped his son Jesse launch a brand of rose wine. Star-powered roses then continued with Sophia by Francis Ford Coppola, and Drew by Drew Barrymore. Needless to say, the imports of rose from Provence into the US doubled in 2016. Rose wines are being made by leading wineries in India for some time  Sula, Grover Zampa and Fratelli. With the fashion statement it is making internationally, the rose wine might finally catch on here. The style is light, fruity and easy-drinking. It may become quite popular in 2019.Rose wines are being made by leading wineries in India  Sula, Grover Zampa and Fratelli. Image: ShutterstockGin cocktailsGin is the new in spirit worldwide. I have noticed last year on all my travels that artisanal gins, cocktails made with gin and articles written on gin are everywhere  Australia, the US, the UK and Italy. Various aromatics and romance revolving around copper stills and ageing, buzzwords like limited edition and seven-year distilled make the spirit more enticing. This doesnt mean that big brands like Tanqueray, Hendricks and Gordons are suffering. Its quite the opposite; I now see a huge presence of, for example, Tanqueray, Tanqueray 10 and Rangpur all over international duty-free shops, even in Tashkent.Artisanal gins, cocktails made with gin and articles written on gin are everywhere  Australia, the US, the UK and Italy.

I have had my fill of rich food, and discovered that I quite like lightly cooked food, too. I have also been struck by a mini-revolution sweeping across the country  that of home delivery outlets.Indeed, I find that 2018 was full of good food delivered at the doorstep by new outlets offering everything from regional food to coastal cuisine to good old Awadhi and Hyderabadi dishes. Someone somewhere in the city is willing to deliver something that you may be yearning for  from stew-appam and Bohri mutton to maachher jhol and couscous salad.Speaking of maachher jhol, I had two excellent Bengali meals prepared by two outlets in Noida  Prinsep 21 and Rendezvous Calcutta. Chef Madhumita, who runs the latter (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456), prepares a mean aloo posto and shukto. And the fish with lentil balls (bori-aloo maachh jhol) is excellent. The Biswas family runs Prinsep 21 (nos: 08010360859 and 8470880448). I loved their dhokar dalna, steamed lentil cakes in gravy, and chicken rezala, a yoghurt based dish that is light, yet most delicious.It was a great year for biryanis, kormas and kababs, too. Some of the best dishes came from a new food outfit called Sassy Begum (no: 9999122999). I loved their tender Sikhampuri kabab and haleem, flavoured with cashew nuts and poppy seeds, and the tangy bagare baingan. The Hyderabadi kuchchey gosht ki biryani was full of flavours and tender pieces of meat. The Godavari chicken biryani from The Biryani Project (no: 8750212212) was superb, too, flavoured as it was with curry leaves. I also fondly remember the galouti kababs and dum nihari gosht that came from Biryani by Kilo (mob: 9555212212;www.biryanibykilo.com). Their Malamaal Biryani was full of the good stuff  with as much meat as rice  and my friends loved it.One of the most exciting deliveries came from a service called The Melting Pot Tiffins (9568199605;http://meltingpottiffins.in/). You can have your fill of regional and community cuisine from this delivery service  which offers everything from Goan, Kashmiri and Bihari to Anglo-Indian and Marwari. I still remember their delightful South Indian vegetarian tiffin -- appam and stew, cabbage phoogath, mini rawa molagapori served with coconut chutney and gooseberry pachadi, and kerala red rice. The Goan chicken hamper consisted of the coriander-flavoured chicken Cafreal, among other dishes, and the Gujarati non-veg hamper included some delicious Bohri mutton. You must not miss their salted caramel kheer -- barnyard millet kheer with jaggery salted caramel.A wonderful mixAnother interesting delivery service is Iras (nos: 9871950119 and 7982837171), which offers a wonderful mix of flavours and dishes that are low fat and appeal especially to the young. I had their air-fried kababs and thin-crust pizzas prepared with light mozzarella cheese. They have various kinds of salads, including grilled veggies with couscous.And, of course, I cannot forget Noshi  and its dimsums. The dimsums  chicken and chestnut, chicken and chilli oil, edamame and truffle  were simply delicious. And I made a great meal out of some Thai steamed fish, cooked in a mild lemony sauce.I enjoyed the coconut Mysore chicken with rice from YumYum South and their small podi-smeared idlis and vadas. From Trial Box (no: 01244601666), I had the Sufiana kabab, som tam salad, harissa chicken and fish that had been lightly grilled and cooked in a lemon-and-butter sauce. The salad was nice and tangy, the kebab platter had various kinds of kebabs  with different flavours (such as patthar key phool and rose petals) and sauces (some hot oriental sauces).Another great discovery was Roomali Garh (no: 9225112277)  an outlet that delivers mainly Rajasthani dishes. The food comes beautifully packaged in bright yellow cartons, which somehow adds to the taste of the food. I loved their Nagori gatta curry, which was nice and spicy, Marwari aloo pyaz, dhundhari kadhi chicken, which consisted of minced balls in a light and flavourful curd-based sauce.All in all, it was a memorable year. And its nice to know that good food is just a mouse click away."

He asked people if ""some people were being troubled because of a tradition of allowing the middlemen.""When the gathering responded with applause, Modi said for the prosperity of the nation, some pain has to be borne to keep middleman at bay. He also lauded the Union telecom ministry for launching a digital pension project, saying it would benefit pensioners immensely, reflecting the citizen-centric approach of his government.""This is our approach to minimum government and maximum governance,"" the Prime Minister said. People can now track the pension status on their mobile phone and don't have to made rounds of offices for pension-related issues.Referring to strides taken in different sectors under the present regime, the Prime Minister said internet connectivity had increased to 65 per cent in the past two years and India now had 50 crore active internet users. This, he said, was special because the growth of internet was equally big and significant in villages.Under his government, he said, 1.25 lakh panchayats have been connected by broadband of which 29,000 villages are in Uttar Pradesh.Purchases by government departments had been shrouded in doubts and charges of favouritism, he said, adding government's e-market place (GEM) can enable the smallest of traders to sell their products. ""This is the best platform for the MSME sector,"" Modi said.Online loans up to Rs 1 crore are now being disbursed in 59 minutes without any red-tape or exploitation, the Prime Minister said.The quality of Ganga water has considerably improved as tested by scientists. He said while schemes had been made for long, the Ganga remained polluted, but not any longer. ""Jab niyat saaf hai to Ganga bhi saaf hogi (if the intention is clear, the Ganga will be cleaner),"" he said as people applauded and raised slogans of 'Har Har Mahadev'.Talking about the industry in Varanasi and nearby areas, Modi said there were 1.5 lakh weavers and 70,000 power looms in the region, and that right from funds to facilitation in marketing their produce, the state and the Union government were working out things for the weavers. ""We will keep extending job opportunities through such schemes,"" he said.Uttar Pradesh's MSME Minister Satyadev Pachauri informed the Prime Minister that so far loans worth Rs 5345 crore had been given to 65,000 artisans in the state and that Rs 75,000 crore loans will be disbursed by banks in the state.The Prime Minister laid the foundation stones for 14 infrastructure projects and inaugurated 12 projects, totalling Rs 279 crore.Earlier Modi inaugurated the International Rice Research Institute and interacted with scientists."

The experts who comprised consultants and officials with the ministry of commerce and industry said that aspiring exporters would do well to study the markets thoroughly before foraying into export business.Trichy and adjoining areas known for their dominance in the agriculture sector were identified as an appropriate region to export agriculture and dairy products, particularly value-added ones. While the entrepreneurs were already addressing local and national demands, many of them remained unaware of the export opportunities of these very products to other countries. The workshop was jointly organised by FIEO (Federation of Indian Export Organizations) and Tiditssia (Tiruchirappalli District Tiny & Small Scale Industries Association) at Ariyamangalam to drive home the complete procedures involved in exporting. Rice varieties can be exported to African countries, particularly South Africa . Entrepreneurs should research their field and sector of export for which we provide concessions and support to participate in international buyer and seller meets to understand the markets, S Selvanayagi, deputy director, FIEO, Chennai said. Besides agriculture, participants were also urged to study the market needs in engineering and textile sectors as Trichy is known for its expertise in manufacturing and fabrication sectors.FIEO said that up to 65% of the expenses incurred in participating in international buyer-seller meets would be borne by the export promoting organisation through market access initiative scheme. With a significant number of the Indian diaspora in Singapore, Ponni rice variety has good demand there, Mahalakshmi Arun Rajkumar, an export marketing consultant, told TOI. Besides rice, Cavendish banana was also identified to have export potential. Credit facilities available for the aspiring entrepreneurs were explained by banking officials at the workshop. N Kanagasabapathy, president of Tiditssia, said that more export promotion workshops were in the pipeline to market Trichy after it was identified as one of the fast-growing cities in the world by an independent economy watchdog earlier this month."

In another related case, a man was served notice four days ago for attempting to sell meat, which had turned bad.Notices were issued to 12 hotels in October after it came to their notice that old rice and meat past their sell-by date were served to customers.In November, notices were served to nine hotels for cooking food in unhygienic conditions. It was found that the water found on their premises and in which the crockeries were washed, were unclean.Though health officials inspected eight hotels in December, they could not find any of them selling stale food. But food safety officials seized 250kg stale meat following tip-off from local residents in Kollamkudimughal ward on Wednesday.Some hotels keep left-over rice for the next day. They serve it to customers after mixing it with fresh rice. Besides, left-over fried non - veg items are also kept for the next day. We have issued notice to all of them. We have also served a notice to a person in Kollamkudimughal after seizing stale meat from him. He kept the meat without permission of the municipality, said a health official in Thrikkakara municipality.The meat was transported from Hyderabad to sell it in hotels here during Christmas and New year celebrations.

From jeera water to fermented rice gruel  nostalgic comfort foods were the flavour of the season.""At our restaurant Avartana, most of the food is meant to rekindle memories of what you ate as a child. For instance, the dumplings are similar to the millet muddes which my mom used to make, and the kozhukattai of Tamil Nadu, says Ajit Bangera, senior executive chef, ITC Grand Chola. ""Even the congee biriyani we offer is like the congee we used to have with fish in Mangalore,"" he adds. Another emerging trend, says Bangera, is to pack Indian breads with nutrition like sorghum rotis.The idea is to take the diner down memory lane. Specific flavours can trigger memories of times spent with loved ones. In fact, with fast food and eating out on the rise, some experts fear youngsters may miss out on food nostalgia. ""Restaurants offer a lot of new as well as western cuisine but we have not given the new generation a taste of what we used to enjoy, the goodness of food our moms used to serve us,"" says Regi Mathew of Kappa Chakka Kandhari.The Kerala restaurant, which launched this year, offers fermented rice gruel, known as pazhamkanji in Kerala, and pazhedu in Tamil Nadu. The humble dish  leftover rice covered with water and fermented overnight, and eaten along with shallots, green chillies, curd and pickle the next day  is popular with customers. ""People want to recreate what we used to enjoy and introduce the new generation to it,"" says Regi, explaining thats why nostalgia food is popular globally. ""Its a way to show gratitude to our moms who served it with love and preserve age-old recipes."" Other restaurants have also been adding on traditional practices. At Savya Rasa, a south Indian eatery, guests get to choose between tulsi, jeera and vetiver water , a practice once common in households. Sri Krishna Sweets too began serving bottles of water with tulsi at their outlets a year ago.Even as restaurants brought back recipes of yore, households reverted to old ways of cooking, discarding Teflon coated cookware for kal chattis (stone pots) and iron kadais. Traditionally, the Kerala aviyal would be cooked in bell metal urulis, mishti doi was set in terracotta cups and dal cooked in earthen pots in tribal Gujarat. These vessels not only enhance the flavours but are also believed to have health benefits. For instance, cooking in an iron kadai would add traces of iron to the food. With people reverting to it, The Crafts Council of India held the second edition of Patram, an exhibition of aesthetic, from-the-kitchen-to-the-table cooking utensils crafted from bell metal, brass, copper, terracotta and ceramics, says Jayasri Samyukta Iyer of CCI."

The collector emphasized that even government officials colluding with rice smugglers would not be spared.The smart cards of department have been divided into five catagories  priority households (PHH- all commodities including sugar ), PHH-AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana) (all commodities including 35 kg rice), Non-PHH (all commodities including rice), NPHH-S (all commodities except rice- option for Sugar) and NPHH-NC (no-commodity).Each card in PHH and NPHH is entitled to 20 kg of rice every month while PHH-AAY card is eligible for 35 kg free rice. Collector warned the status of the card would be changed to NPHH-NC.In Trichy, around 1.2 crore kg of rice are distributed to around 7.24 lakhs cards out of 7.95 lakh cards every month. While majority of the poor families fully utilize the free rice for their own purpose, most of middle class people neglect them citing its poor quality. However, the officials maintained that the free rice is on a par with others available in the market.Officials said the rice provided free to priority households (PHH) cards are either sold to rice mills for making flour or to some poor people. On an average, one can gather around 100 kg a month. Though we seized some quantity of rice, we could not get the details of person who sold them. We can act only on information, said an official.Social worker S N Kamakodi Sundar said the several middle class people gave the free rice to their housemaid and poor people known to them. The poor people sell the rice to the Idly batter manufacturers for Rs 10 per kg, he said.The practice of feeding the milch cows with the gruel made out of PDS rice is rampant among the farmers in villages in the district for several years now.Though the cost escalation of cow feeds is said to be one of the reasons for adding the rice gruel to the menu, the soaked rice mixed rice water (vaicha kanji) dish was being offered to the cattle previously.Since the price of normal quality cooking rice has touched around Rs 35 and the best quality reached Rs 60, people have started going for PDS rice that is available at throwaway price."

Though it has only been a month since Devi started to sell the evening snack thattu vadai set at her roadside stall in Nandhi Kovil Street near Teppakulam, it has already become a favourite among many. Thattu vadai set is a delicious twist to the traditional thattais or ellu adai (a crispy snack made with rice flour and sesame). In Thattu vadai, vegetables and chutney varieties are stuffed between two small thattais. The stall is open from 4pm to 8.30pm every day and caters to around 50 to 100 customers daily.According to Devi, she had no plans of starting the food stall, but her daughter and son-in-law gave her the idea to help her overcome boredom at home. She then zeroed in on making thattu vadai set after a similar venture by a man at Small Kammala Street proved to be successful. ""I initially had no idea on how it should be done. Later, my daughter showed me YouTube videos and I learnt by watching them,"" she added.Devi prepares two different chutneys for thattu vadai set -- raw mango chutney and peanut chutney -- both of which have tamarind, onions and chillis as accompaniments to the main ingredients. She then smears the chutneys in two thattai sets respectively and between them, she stuffs beetroot , carrot, raw mango, onion and coriander , all in raw form and serves them to the customers. ""The preparation is very easy. For now, Ive been preparing thattais myself but if demand is more, I get it from the snack shops and then make thattu vadai set.

Four sets of thattu vadai set are available at Rs 20.Devi said that she was proud of the fact that only within a months time she has got several loyal customers. ""Though there are a couple more thattu vadai set stalls, the dish is still not very common in Trichy and is pretty popular in Salem. So people are finding my snack relatively new and are loving it,"" she said.When asked if she had any plans to expand her food stall in the future, she said she would be introducing kaara pori (spicy puffed-rice) from this week.""The initial response has been so much better than I had anticipated.

A ten-day workshop was formally inaugurated on December 26 for this purpose.The six huts at the SCZCC premises were made seven years back by the tribals. We have invited them to repair and renovate so that the original look remains intact, says programme officer Gopal Baitawar.We have also invited Nagpurians to join these artists to do the repair work. This is a good opportunity to know about the genuine tribal methods of construction which are now getting lost, he adds. The huts have been made in Rajwada, Madiya, Bhil, Warli and Gound tribal styles.The tribals are using only natural materials to repair the huts. The primary structure is made with bamboo and walls are made from a mix of cow dung and mud, says Manaki Vayoda, Warli artist from Palghar. Manaki has etched Warli figures of mud on the walls which will be painted in white colour. For this, I will use acrylic paint as it lasts longer and survives rains, she says.Pyarelal Vayom from Dindhori village in Madhya Pradesh has used a mixture of rice husk, mud and cow dung in the Gound hut that he is repairing. The spacious hut has lilari kothi in the centre which is used for storing grains by villagers. I am using white, yellow and black soil brought from the banks of river Amarkantak. This will add colour to the structure, he says.The hut being made by Dilip Gadauna from Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh gets its aesthetics from Bhil paintings that cover the walls.There is abundance of light and air coming from hand carved windows with its intricately designed jaali. We use a mix of coir, mud, cow dung and husk to form a smooth plaster from which these windows are made, he informs.The Ghotul which Shivshankar Rajwade from Sarguja in Chhattisgarh describes as Honeymoon hut is being given a fresh coat of plaster made with mud, cow dung, pilli mitti mixed with a adhesive.The bamboo roof too is being repaired. At the other end, celebrated tribal artist Parvati Bai, also from Chhattisgarh, has given a refurbished look to the spacious Rajwade hut. The walls get a smooth feel as we use multani mitti which I have brought from Ambikapur, she says."

The mill owners are expected to remit Rs. 17.5 lakh for 1,000 quintals of rice to be procured, and hence are hesitating to commit themselves.P. Shivanna, Joint Director, Food, Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs, said there were 151 rice mills in the district, of which two have registered for procurement, while another has evinced fresh interest.There is an issue over a specific clause as per which the rice mill owners who have agreed to procure paddy from farmers have to furnish a bank guarantee, he said. Once the issue is settled, the procurement exercise will begin, said the official. The two mills have committed to procure 10,000 quintals of paddy each from the farmers.Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Abhiram Sankar said the paddy procurement exercise would commence from January 1, 2019, for those who have already registered. Grading and assessment of paddy is under way, he added. Nearly 4,500 farmers across the district had agreed to sell the produce directly to mill owners and are waiting for the procurement exercise to begin.But paddy procurement would be limited to the crop cultivated by small and marginal farmers owning not more than 2.5 hectares of land, and the government has also capped the maximum quantity that could be procured from each farmer at 40 quintals.A section of farmers has already complained that they cannot store the harvested crop anymore while the Federation of State Farmers Association has asked the government not to limit procurement only from small and marginal farmers.Kurubur Shanthakumar of the federation said the shadow boxing between the government and the rice mill owners over the bank guarantee clause has put farmers in trouble. The procurement should have commenced from December 16, but is yet to start, he said.Coming down on capping the procurement at 40 quintals per farmer, Mr. Shanthakumar said there was drought for two years and farmers were not allowed to cultivate paddy. Having reaped a rich harvest this year, the farmers were eager to sell the crop to earn a decent income. The government should lift the cap, he added."

So, voters have become too cynical to believe in them.With a population of about 1,200 in 210 houses, Laxmi Nagar, a small village in Papannapet mandal, about nine km from the mandal headquarters, and 12 km from the district headquarters, is different.A moral contractWith panchayat elections round the corner, the village is taking its problems head on by making contestants commit themselves to development and give a written assurance to the voters to that extent. Under their Peoples Manifesto, residents are preparing an image of a Rs. 100-bond paper on which the contestant as well the voters will sign an agreement in which the villagers put up some demands. We have imposed an image of bond paper on which the demands are put forth by the voters. This will be signed by both the voters and contestants. While this has no legal validity, it will be morally binding on the winners as it was signed in the presence of voters, clarified Mr. Pendyala Prasad, an IT professional and social activist, and the man behind the initiative.It will be stated in the bond that the sarpanch has to spend at least two hours every day at the panchayat office, holding meetings with ward members once in three months, construct drains without taking sides, taking action against illegal constructions, organising cattle health camp once in three months, repairing road that were damaged due to Mission Bhagiratha and treating villagers skin problems caused by dust coming out of the rice mills in the village.Village detailsThe Peoples Manifesto would have data about the main revenue resources in the village, irrigation facilities, main health problems, whether every house has a toilet, facilities in the primary health centre, including doctors, nurses and medicines and whether a vehicle is available during a medical emergency, among others.Similarly, details about drinking water, street lights, internal roads, skill development centre, problems with belt shops (unlicensed liquor shops) will also be mentioned.The idea is to identify problems of the village house-wise and street-wise in detail and make the elected representatives address them. We are printing the 12-page Peoples Manifesto and handing it over to all the houses along with the bond papers. The candidate as well as the elder in the family will sign the papers that both of them will take part in village development, said Mr. Pendyala. The final manifesto will be prepared once the house-wise needs are identified, he added."

The eyeball, also hinting an image of the moon, is painted using cement, which is the basic medium used for painting in the whole project. A little into the exhibition, is placed the shows centrepiece Grey Areas, with clouds painted using cement, depicting the pernicious usage of concrete in our lives, and how it's spreading its legs into all the vacant spaces of the human existence. The medium cement, Sitaram explains, carries the whole narrative of vastly growing urbanisation and usage of concrete in the name of welfare and growth of our society and how it is spreading and blocking our lives in personal and societal conditions.Sitaram Swain is an Odisha-based artist known for installation art. He was the winner of the Glenfiddich Emerging Artist of the Year' 2017 from among 810 participants across India and was awarded a three-month residency at the Glenfiddich Distillery in Scotland. Grey Areas' exhibits artworks created during and post the residency.Describing his stay at the Glenfiddich distillery both amusing and surprising, Sitaram says that the several things that he had to make peace with included how the dark sky of the nights in Scotland, unlike India, stretched only to 2-3 hours, and how the food was without rice. He explains how he combined these two aspects to make a beautiful, sublime visual of the dark night sky filled with sky made of real rice grains  The Story of Hundred Nights.Unconventional ideasSitaram is also known for his unconventional ideas and profuse connection with household objects. Owing to the familiarity with these objects for such strong engagement and the reason for using cement as the material for this project, Sitaram explains, As an artist, my job is to transform such household elements to a larger context, which could be political, universal or sublime. There is great possibility that I always find in these objects to make a dialogue to a larger audience as it connects to everyone because of its universal usage. And cement is a very fundamental material of construction and it carries the whole history and narrative of vastly growing urbanisation. The idea behind choosing cement as a material was, it has a predefined notion of three dimensions, stiffness and solidity but using it as a painterly material gave me a whole range of possibility.Describing the title of the project, Sitaram says, What I want to portray is not just the grey appearance of cement or concrete but the deeper meaning of grey which stand here as a metaphor of uncertainty, anxiety and impermanence. This is again quite relevant to the contemporary situation which is opposite to the nature of concrete that is a strong and a permanent material. But, all around us it seems very unstable and impermanent because of continuous construction and deconstruction.Painting flowers, insects, clouds or other vibrant elements of nature with cement hints a strong irony. The idea is to portray all the natural aspects those are slowly disappearing because of vast urbanisation such as sky, clouds, plants, flowers, etc and again painting them with cement, which is a primary and prominent material in the urban surrounding, gives it a layering of satire on the contemporary Indian urbanisation, sums up Sitaram.(The show is on at Art District XIII, Lado Sarai till January 5, 2019.)"

The area under paddy cultivation which was around 600 million hectares in the 1970s has come down to 300 million hectares as per the recent figures. Kerala is importing over 80% of its rice requirements, and is able to meet less than 20% of the demand through domestic production,"" the minister said.Sunilkumar said the government's target was to increase the area of rice cultivation from to 2.20 lakh hectares 3lakh hectares. ""We want to debunk the myth that rice production is not profitable in Kerala. The state government is offering various incentives, and on an average, a farmer could make a profit of at least Rs 25,000 per acre of paddy cultivation, provided the farmer is ready to invest hard work. The minimum support price for paddy in Kerala is Rs 25.30 per kg in Kerala while it is only Rs 17.50 at the national level,"" Sunilkumar said.The minister said that the agriculture department would ensure that the farmers get machines, at the required time, through the introduction of a mobile app. The shortage of labour will be addressed by forming Karshaka Karma Sena.A 10 -year-programme has been evolved for the overall development of coconut sector. The area under coconut cultivation will be increased from 7.81 lakh hectares to 9.25 lakh hectares, while the productivity will be augmented from 6,889 coconuts per hectare to 8,500 coconuts per hectare. Also, there has been drastic hike in vegetable production in the state. Now, the state meets 50% of the domestic demand through internal production, Sunilkumar said.Prof K P Mani, former professor and HOD Economics, Calicut University, said government investment is still low in the agriculture sector."
5ce52ec0e8e3fc56af40a792,"Following Durga, Lulu and Nana on the designer baby trail",https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/following-durga-lulu-and-nana-on-the-designer-baby-trail/cid/1679991,2018-12-27,"There are some curious parallels and divergences between what broke out as news from Shenzhen, China last month and what happened 40 years back in Calcutta on October 3, 1978. Back then it was the Indian doctor, Subhash Mukherjee, who created Indias first test tube baby through in-vitro fertilization, Durga or Kanupriya; now it is the doctor, He Jiankui, who has claimed to be the creator of the worlds first genetically-edited babies by applying CRISPR-Cas9 technology to human embryos.Mukherjee was not recognized for his work, so he committed suicide in 1981. Meanwhile, the doctor, R.G. Edwards won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2010 for enabling the birth of the worlds first IVF baby, Marie Louise Brown, 67 days before Durga was born. Just as He had his training at Rice and Stanford University in the latest in genomic sequencing in the West, Mukherjee, too, had picked up nuances in IVF from Edinburgh University after training in India.Unlike He though, Mukherjee didnt get domestic recognition in the scientific community (He was recruited by the Chinese government-backed Thousand Talents Plan) and also belonged to an India of the early 1980s, crippled with a closed economy and far away from the heft that China commands globally today. But it does seem that both doctors were inspired by the needs from the demand side overcoming supply side constraints, and decided to unleash their creativity to solve the problems of parents riding past issues around medical ethics. From news reports it seems that Chinese healthcare authorities are now clamping down on He, and it remains to be seen what happens to the cottage industry on gene-sequencing of human embryos with the CRISPR technology and its global diffusion over time. It has to be seen whether the parents of Lulu and Nana support He publicly or whether they withdraw silently as happened with Durgas parents. Mukherjee was left alone to fight his IVF battle.Beyond the above parallels, what happened in Shenzhen and earlier in Calcutta have some socio-political implications. It was reported earlier that the Chinese communist party has an interest in creating designer babies through some of its supported work at the Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen. What will the partys stated stance be in Hes case? Meanwhile, Calcutta, too, is emerging as a potential hub for an Indian version of a similar socio-political experiment. In May 2017, the Calcutta High Court allowed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-linked Arogya Bharati organization to carry out a programme on how to conceive children who would be tall and fair (susantans) provided it adhered to strict conditions of garbha sanskar, apparently a scientific process being researched on by the Garbhvigyan Anusandhan Kendra of Jamnagar, Gujarat.Some reports indicate that prices for garbha sanskar facilitated designer babies will be about seven dollars approximately, which is about one-tenth the price of designer babies reported earlier in American media. While ambiguity still remains about capabilities, prices and the policy environment that will engender the market for susantans, the genie is clearly out of the bottle. Much of this race for affordable but quality genomically designed babies may soon be fought out in the Asian market.Hes work also raises some interesting questions about how institutional review boards for human research are interpreted, constituted and operationalized in Eastern and Western cultures. An outcome of the National Research Act of 1974 with predominantly American origins, it would be interesting to see if Hes actions create a new norm for IRBs in Asia that will push the frontier of medical ethics, the inspiration coming from Lulu and Nana. That apart, one can certainly expect some supply-side upstream ramifications. While China has, over the last decade, become a hotbed of genomics research, the origins of gene-sequencing and frontier work in the area may still be in the United States of America. Jennifer Doudna from University of California, Berkeley, the inventor of CRISPR, has a company, Caribou, to commercialize the technology. Even He and other researchers associated with him seem to be scientist-entrepreneurs with several companies being run to monetize their scientific work both in the US and in China.If such is the case, one wonders who will carry forward basic research in the labs of genomic scientists, for several issues in biology, physics, chemistry and related sciences remain untested. This also leads to the question of how scientific team formations will evolve in the world of genomic science given the shock delivered by He. Can one expect fewer international teams of co-invention constituting Chinese and Indian collaborators? One cannot also be sure about the future of international gene-editing experiments running at universities like Harvard and Stanford, among others. Medical ethics is also at a key inflexion point given the criticism of He, although some providing balanced support are also emerging (George Church, the Harvard geneticist, among others). We need to watch what happens to the trajectory of science fathered by the scientific fathers of Lulu, Nana and Durga."

The ready-roasted kind also goes down well.Rat has become a valuable source of income for the tribal people who struggle to make ends meet working in Assam's famed tea gardens.In the winter months when tea picking slumbers, the tribals go to rice paddies to trap rats for the market.A kilogram of rat meat, which is considered a delicacy, sells for about Rs 200 -- as much as for chicken and pork.Farmers say the region has seen growing numbers of rats in recent years.""We put traps in the fields as the rats eat people's paddy,"" Samba Soren, a rat vendor at Kumarikatan, said.The rodents are hunted at night during the harvesting season with traps made from bamboo.The traps are placed at the entrance of the rat-holes in the evening and the rodents are caught as they come out to scavenge.The vendors have to work at night to make sure other predators do not get to the dead rats first. Some of the rats weigh more than a kilogram and the market traders say they get between 10 and 20 kilograms a night."
