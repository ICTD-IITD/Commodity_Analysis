Sixteen of its 18 wards remained under water for about six days. More than 4,000 houses were damaged. Farm land came out of the floods in bad shape. Vegetable crops and a total of over 14,000 banana plants were lost to the floods.However, farmers in panchayat now promise to rise above their troubles, thanks to an initiative, Choornikkara Agricultural Package, aimed at using the post-floods soil conditions as a prop to revive agriculture.Silt deposit had resulted in total loss of soil aeration in most of the farm areas and there was serious depletion of micro organisms in the soil, said an officer in the Department of Agriculture. These posed a severe challenge.The floods had also left its mark in the increased soil acidity. Scientists from the Vyttila Rice Research Station, who did a preliminary study of the conditions, suggested remedial measures and the Choornikkara Package, recently approved by the government, is now being implemented.The Rs. 31-lakh project aims at increasing acreage under coconut cultivation, increasing the spread of paddy cultivation as well as organic farming in the areas that had seen huge silt deposits in the post-flood days.Department aidThe department has decided that most of the farmers, who had lost everything in the floods, needed to be given assistance.Works to help increase soil aeration for 5,000 coconut trees were carried out free of cost. Compost, dolomite, magnesium sulphate and borax were supplied free of cost to the farmers to improve the soil conditions.Trichorderma-coir pith cakes were supplied at the rate of three cakes per coconut trees to prevent the rot disease among the trees in the post-flood scenario.The package has also helped to bring over 22 acres of Katteppadam paddy collective under cultivation. The land has been lying fallow for over two decades, said the officer.Around 90% of the cost of the cultivation will be borne by the department under the agricultural package."

As per these instructions, auction of paddy land here for shrimp farming can be conducted only after October 31. Sluice gates that enable shrimp farming can be opened only after November 15, and their operation will have to be conducted under the supervision of the Irrigation Department. Shrimp farmers have to obtain proper licences for their farming activities, which have to be wound up by April 15.According to Francis Kalathungal of the Pokkali Samrakshana Samiti, this would be help pokkali paddy farmers in the area who have been facing low harvests over the past few years (primarily due to the early commencement of the shrimp farming season, which necessitates letting in saline water into paddy fields). While the increased salinity is ideal for the shrimps, the pokkali rice plants (which are at different stages of flowering and fruiting at this time) suffer, affecting paddy production.Lucrative shrimpsWith shrimps now emerging as an important export item, farming them has become more lucrative than pokkali paddy cultivation, he said. Government policies that offer more subsidies for pisciculture have also played a role in this trend.As a result, the traditional timelines for pokkali and shrimp or fish farming in these rice fields have taken a hit. Traditionally, fields are emptied of salt water by April 15 and dried. The first summer showers that arrive soon after wash away any remaining salt. By the time the southwest monsoon hits the area in June, the fields are ready to receive pokkali saplings and paddy cultivation begins in the low-saline conditions. By late October-early November, pokkali rice is harvested; shrimp cultivation commences in the same fields under high saline conditions and ends by next April. However, currently, leases for shrimp farming are available at the beginning of July itself, permitting shrimp farmers (who take the pokkali paddies on lease) to let in salt water.Hence we were able to harvest paddy only from three acres of the 220 acres of cultivable land within the Maruvakkad padasekharam this year, said Mr. Kalathungal, who also cultivates five acres of paddy in the area.But this could change if the new orders are implemented properly, said Chandu M.M., an award-winning pokkali farmer.The new orders regulating shrimp cultivation are strong and I hope they will be implemented not just in Maruvakkad but the entire pokkali-growing area in the State soon, said Mr. Chandu. These rules should also be made legally binding and any defaulters should be pulled up. It would also be ideal if leases for shrimp farming are not be given before October, added Mr. Kalathungal."

The ready-roasted kind also goes down well. Rat has become a valuable source of income for the poorAdivasi tribal people who struggle to make ends meet working in Assams famed tea gardens. In the winter months when tea picking slumbers, the Adivasis go to rice paddies to trap rats for the market.One kg of rat meat, which is considered a delicacy, sells for about Rs. 200  as much as for chicken and pork.Farmers say the region has seen growing numbers of rats in recent years. We put traps in the fields as the rats eat peoples paddy, said Samba Soren, a rat vendor at Kumarikata.The rodents are hunted at night during the harvesting season with traps made from bamboo.The traps are placed at the entrance of the rat-holes in the evening and the rodents are caught as they come out to scavenge.The vendors work at night to make sure other predators do not get to the dead rats first. Some of the rats weigh more than a kg and the traders say they get between 10 and 20 kg a night."

AP pictureIndonesian rescue teams on Wednesday struggled to reach remote areas on the western coast of Java amid an extreme weather rain warning after a tsunami killed more than 400 people last week.Heavy rain lashed fishing villages along the coast, muddying roads and holding up convoys delivering heavy machinery and aid to isolated areas while authorities urged residents to stay away from the shore in case of further waves.Clouds of ash spewed from the nearby Anak Krakatau, almost obscuring the volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide on Saturday sent waves up to 16ft high smashing into the coast on the Sunda Strait, between Java and Sumatra islands.Indonesias meteorology agency (BMKG) said the rough weather could make the volcanos crater more fragile.We have developed a monitoring system focused specifically on the volcanic tremors at Anak Krakatau so that we can issue early warnings, said BMKG head Dwikorita Karnawati, adding that a 2km exclusion zone had been imposed.The confirmed death toll is 430, with at least 159 people missing. A state of emergency has been declared until January 4, which authorities hope will make it easier to deploy assistance, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the national disaster mitigation agency.Search and rescue teams were focused on the town of Sumur near the southwest tip of Java, but the roads are damaged and clogged and helicopters had to be deployed to carry out assessments and evacuations, he added.Along the coast, thousands of people are staying in tents and temporary shelters like mosques or schools. Rice and instant noodles have been delivered to many shelters, but clean water, wet weather gear, fresh clothes, and blankets are in short supply, some evacuees said.Ade Hasanah, 45, staying in an emergency centre with her children, said people were being told not to return to their homes."

The singer rewrote the lyrics of the 1953 song to send out a message that she doesnt need Santa to buy her things because she can buy her own damn stuff. After all, she makes her own money! A far cry from the original lines, sung by Eartha Kitt, which has her giving Santa a long list of things she wants. Be it ...a yacht, and really thats not a lot or ...a sable under the tree for me (for the uninitiated, sable is a wrap or shawl made of fur), the womans list of wants seem endless. But Mileys version, revamped for women of 2018, will have none of that begging and pleading. In her assured, empowered style she screams out, Santa baby, I dont need any fancy jewelry, not me... No thanks, I can buy myself whatever I want.The song, presented on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night, also got a MeeToo update with the lines: Santa baby, Id love to know my ass wont get grabbed / At work / By some ignorant jerk / Tell the dirtbags, to put away their chimneys tonight.And last but not the least, the singer is incredibly on-point when she bats for harassment free workplaces with the lines: A girls best friend is equal pay / Stop interrupting me when I talk / And dont text me pictures of your [interrupted by a strategically timed ringtone].Women across the twin cities echo Mileys sentiments. Speaking to Hyderabad Times, self-made, independent and successful city women explain why they are their own Santa this Christmas.I dont need materialistic things, I have everything I want. I dont wait for Christmas to buy myself something. If I want something, I just buy it. Im looking for Santa though. If I find him, I will buy some stuff from him only. No one has ever asked him what he would want for Christmas. Im a self-made independent woman and I would like to be nice and buy some stuff for Santa.  Adah SharmaIve never waited for Santa (or anyone else) to buy anything for me! Travelling with my daughter gives me the greatest joy  teaching her that life isnt all about things and objects, but about experiences and connections. We are so fortunate and I work so hard to be able to share this with her. We are currently in Los Angeles  visiting with dear friends and learning about how big and beautiful this world is. And this Christmas, I bought my daughter a trip to Los Angeles and I am getting her everything on her list by myself.  Lakshmi ManchuEver since I was a child, my parents never let me believe that there was a Santa. They always told me that there are no free lunches or gifts and you always have to work for everything you want. And this is something I have always believed in. And yes, I feel everything you do in life depends on who you are and how you work for it. Everything I have is my hard work. I still have a lot of dreams and the Santa in me will fulfill those dreams. And I can buy anything I want to whenever I want. Rakul Preet SinghIve heard the Santa baby song since I was a child and always sang along to it. Its only when I heard Mileys version did it actually strike me that the lady does have a point! The original song does belittle the independent woman of today. Thankfully the times have changed! With so many women working and earning, many now have the freedom to swipe that card or write that cheque for whatever they want. And many have partners that encourage them to be independentand to be truly free to do as they please. We need to instil in our daughters that the sky is the limit. Teach them to work hard, earn well and buy what they want.You are your own Santa, baby!  Sabina Xavier, entrepreneurWe keep buying stuff like bags and diamonds for Christmas, but Ive always wanted to buy a luxury car. And my dad, who is a doctor, loves luxury cars. So I got one for myself, and my dad is ecstatic. I also have my own restaurant in Bangalore and I wish to open more in the future by myself. So, no Santa required. I wish to do buy myself fancy stuff and make my own investments. Pranitha Subhash , actorIve always believed that one should be their own Santa. Ive never got things easily in life and Ive learnt to work hard to make my dreams come true. And only you can do that, nobody else can do it for you. In fact, I always write down my goals and work towards them.  Mehreen Pirzada , actorIve grown up in a family that has always pampered me and never let me buy things on my own. My mom believes I am still the youngest in the house and that I have to save money for myself for the future, rather than spend it now. Yet, this year, I have become my own Santa as Im about to buy my first home. Being independent and capable enough to gift myself a home at an age where my friends are still studying in colleges is a special feeling indeed. Christmas for me has always been the time that I spend with family. However, because of my film career, I dont always have the luxury of staying with them all the time, but I hold the festival close to my heart. Jewellery is something Im extremely fond of and my mom indulges in them during this part the year to keep me happy. And its a privilege to receive gifts from a home-bound Santa and also be a Santa for myself.  Sayyeshaa, actorI bought myself a last minute solo trip to experience the Kochi Bienalle for Christmas. My role as an artist in this beautiful country is not restricted to just entertaining but also creating music that feeds the soul and make us a better collective. Creations of beauty with meaning have the power of doing that. The theme for this years Biennale  Possibilities for a Non-Alienated Life  is curated by the festivals first female curator, Anita Dube and has art that is much more inclusive, featuring many female artists from around the world. To spend the end of my year being stimulated by art and informed by politics of various perspectives is my gift to myself. I also plan to eat the delicious food on offer, proceeds of which Im told will go towards preserving some rare strains of rice in the sub-continent. Art to stimulate my creative juices for 2019 and great food for a cause, how much merrier can Christmas get!!  Sona Mohapatra , singerI have got everything in my life using my hard-earned money  be it my three houses to my cars to watches and diamonds rings, everything. Forget about Santa, no boyfriend got me all of these. I am independent and can buy myself anything this Christmas I want. Sanjjanaa, actorJust like how Miley mentioned in the song, I too have always bought myself whatever I wanted. I never waited for a Santa or anyone to come and buy me jewellery, house or a car. I got everything that I wanted as my parents always told me not to hold myself back and not depend on anyone. Materialistic stuff, in particular, is something that I can never wish from others.

However, an increasing demand of Chinese manja in the last couple of years has forced Rahmats family, which has been in the traditional cotton manja making business for 70-years, to look for new business avenues. The family now has opened a tiffin store, selling idly and dosa.Traditional manja makers in the patang markets of Dabeerpura, Gulzar Houz and Dhoolpet say the market has seen a major slump as demand for Chinese manja increases by leaps despite a nation-wide ban. The Centre had banned Chinese manja and other non-biodegradable threads made of plastic. On the other hand, traditional manja is prepared using gum, aloe vera, soap, egg , rice and glass powder and then the pulp is rubbed against regular thread to give a fine character. About 200 families in Dabeerpura, Gulzaar Houz and Dhoolpet involved in manja making spend six to eight months preparing the thread. Apart from being more dangerous, the Chinese manja is also expensive compared to the traditional variety.A bundle of Chinese manja is sold for 80 while the traditional variety costs 20. And yet, every customer asks for the dangerously sharp Chinese Manja, informed Rafeeq Ahmed, a wholesale Manja and patang dealer at Gulzaar Houz. More than 60% families have dropped out of the traditional manja making business owing to lack of profits, he added."

5ce53ac8e8e3fc56af40ad14,Elections in an embattled democracy,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/elections-in-an-embattled-democracy/article25829638.ece,2018-12-26,"Elections in Bangladesh are famously a blood sport. During the campaigns virtually every constituency turns into its own bull ring, as party cadres treat rival banners like a matadors red cape. With polls slated for December 30, the first two weeks of canvassing have already seen eight deaths and dozens injured. Given our historic standards, though, these numbers are still pretty low.With a first-past-the-post system, Bangladeshs elections come down to a choice between coalitions led by the two major political parties: the secular-centrist Awami League and the quasi-Islamist Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). The Awami League has governed since 2009, delivering economic growth and rolling back extremist militancy. The country hit 7.86% GDP growth in 2017-18. Under the Awami League government, the countrys power output has quadrupled in the last decade, and Bangladesh has topped regional rankings on many social indicators such as gender parity in primary education and maternal mortality.The BNP threatYet, the much beleaguered BNP still poses a threat to the Awami League. In addition to traditional anti-incumbency, a swathe of the public  especially sections of the intelligentsia and urban youth  has grown weary of the Awami Leagues heavy-handed rule, which was sorely on display during two rounds of student protests earlier this year. The Awami League also passed a needlessly harsh Digital Security Bill earlier this year. This has not gone down well with an increasingly digitised populace. Ironically enough, it is the ruling partys own massive programme of Digital Bangladesh that has led to the mass adoption of tech and Internet services.Despite some just criticism of the Awami Leagues record on rights, critics who pretend that authoritarianism is a problem unique to the Awami League are being disingenuous. Not only did Bangladesh suffer military dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s, the country has struggled to establish a culture of political tolerance even since the advent of democracy in 1991.To understand why, a quick recap of pivotal moments of the past is unavoidable. The BNP won the first democratic polls in 1991, but refused to step down when their tenure ended in 1996. The Awami League led a mass movement to topple the BNP government and won the ensuing polls. In a contrast to the BNP, the Awami League voluntarily stepped down from power in 2001, and handed over the reins to an interim government as the Constitution required back then.The BNP went on to win the 2001 polls, raising hopes of more trust-building measures. Instead, the BNP celebrated its victory in October 2001 with a pogrom on Hindu minorities that left hundreds killed, raped or injured across many districts. The BNP also pivoted sharply to the right and gave political patronage to extremist outfits which carried out a series of fatal attacks. One attack, in August 2004, targeted Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina, killing 19 people and injuring hundreds. Among the dead was Ivy Rahman, head of the womens wing of the Awami League. A separate attack the following year killed the Awami Leagues former Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria.When the BNPs tenure came to an end in 2006, once again the party refused to hand over power to a credible caretaker government. The ensuing Awami League protests led to a stalemate that was broken finally with the installation of a military-backed regime in January 2007. Dhakas self-styled civil society, dominated by Anglophone members of non-governmental organisations, and media, who enjoy disproportionate access to and credence with foreign diplomats and media, supported that non-democratic regime.An unusual coalitionToday, it is a leader of that civil pack, Kamal Hossain, who has joined hands with the BNP  and by extension their ally Jamaat-e-Islami  to promise a restoration of democracy. Mr. Hossain is a renowned lawyer who was tasked by the nations founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to author the countrys secular constitution. He also served as a minister in Sheikh Mujibs cabinet in the early 1970s. But he split from the Awami League in the 1990s and formed his own minor political party, the Gono Forum, which has never won a parliamentary seat.Mr. Hossain had promised that he would not form any alliance with the BNP if it didnt sever its relationship with the Jamaat. In reality, the BNP nominated 25 Jamaat leaders to contest polls on its ticket. As it happens, Mr. Hossains own Gono Forum is also running on the BNPs symbol of rice stalks. When journalists questioned Mr. Hossain about this awkward marriage, he yelled at them to be quiet, in Urdu (khamosh).It was perhaps always fanciful to think that any outsider could simply save the BNP, a party that has ceased to function like a mainstream participant in a democracy since 2001. Even in opposition, the BNP has resorted to grotesque forms of new violence. Ahead of the last polls, in 2014, the BNP and Jamaat sponsored petrol-bombing of commuter buses that left more than 100 dead. That violent campaign was resumed in 2015.Apologists for the BNP, including members of civil society, try to argue that all parties engage in violence. While violence has been sadly endemic to Bangladeshi politics, it has been confined mainly to clashes between party cadres and police. Ordinary citizens were never the target, until the petrol-bombing campaigns of 2013 and 2015.Awami Leagues recordThe Awami League has resorted to hardline tactics, no doubt. But in what democracy are incumbents facing a rival who had tried to literally bomb them out of existence? If anything, the Awami League may be at fault for not holding the BNP and Jamaat organisationally accountable for all the violence explicitly targeting civilians. It is not at all clear why groups that engage in violence akin to insurgent or terror groups should enjoy the respect or rights of a mainstream political party.Voters in Bangladesh face an imperfect choice today. It may feel unpalatable to many of them to vote for an incumbent which has been excessively heavy-handed at times, while delivering much economic and social progress. But if the alternative is a party with a record of stoking extremism and targeting civilians for violence, then one must ask if it is at all wise to seek change for the sake of mere change.K.

Mallikarjuna, Ms. Suryavathi highlighted the need for extending relief to all the affected persons. Reacting positively, Dr. Mallikarjuna asked officials of the civil supplies department to make arrangements for disbursing the relief material to all those affected by the cyclone.As many as 380 people from different parts of the district submitted their complaints and grievances to the district officials and brought to the notice of the officials issues such as land encroachments, boundary disputes, non-availability of ration card and pension and the issue of unemployment. The issues were forwarded to the departments concerned for appropriate action.

There is a crop insurance scheme for farmers. How much does the Centre pay? It pays Rs 20 out of Rs 100 and we give Rs 80. The state government gives 80 per cent of the cost. If we can give Rs 80, we can give the rest also. We do not need their pittance. We transferred the amount to the banks and now the Centre is taking credit for it and spreading lies, she said.Explained Measures positive, impact depends on implementation By promising measures such as increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for paddy and dealing with issues regarding middlemen, TMC is attempting to portray a farmer-friendly image ahead of election season. An agricultural expert opined that both moves are positive, especially the decision to rein in middlemen. However, the success of the measures depends on how well they are implemented after the time for poll rhetoric is over.Accusing the Centre of not being serious about addressing the farmers distress, the chief minister claimed her government has taken a lot of initiative for farmers, including raising the MSP for paddy.AdvertisingWe have waived off mutation fees and khajna tax on agricultural land. We have given financial compensation to farmers for natural disasters. We are procuring rice from farmers at Rs 1,750 per quintal (from Rs 1,550 per quintal last year).

People from all over the world are here. The occasion is the 715th urs of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya , which began on Monday.For Sufis, death is the end of mortal life and union with the almighty. Urs is a celebration of that. Hazrat Nizamuddins urs began with the fateh dua (prayer), followed by a qawwali performance and langar distribution.This year, a delegation of about a hundred people has come from Pakistan to take part in the urs. Only last week, the Pakistan High Commissioner had visited the dargah to present a chaddar.Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia preached and practised the principles of humanity and brotherhood without any discrimination. That is why people irrespective of religion, caste and creed come here in large numbers. You will find that 70% of the crowd here is non-Muslim, said Syed Aziz Nizami, the sajjada nashin.Kanwal Narain Sharma (84) has been distributing tea among the devotees for the past 65 years. The desire to serve tea here every day is my hunger, Sharma said, handing out biscuits to the younger crowd. People come here when they feel troubled or face any problem. And I wholly believe in his (Nizamuddin Aulia) power to heal, Sharma said as someone standing behind him added, Badshahon ka badshah (king of kings).Syed Mohammad has come all the way from Kabul. I come every year. The whole experience brings me great inner peace, he said.There are many from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh who come here every year despite difficulties. The difficulties seem worth it at the end. I visit without fail every year, said Mohammad Hasan, a driver from Bihar.At the dargah, the music of qawwali melds with voices of people lining up to receive the days langarbiryani. Nizami says the qawwals arent hired by the dargah but they all volunteer22 or 24 groups, all famous ones from all over the country. At the Urs Mahal outside, musical performances are held separately.Its chilly outside, but hot tandoors and grills cooking naans and kebabs provide some warmth.The urs celebration would continue till December 28, beginning every day at 11am. The qawwalis would continue till late into the night as would the langar and tabarruk, a kind of prasad in the form of sweet rice or gram flour chappati.The nearest metro station to reach the dargah is JLN Stadium."

These are some of the serious fall outs of ecological devastation caused by sewage water being released into the forest area by both Haryana and Punjab for several decades.The chief conservator of forest ( CCF ) Chandigarh has written to additional chief secretary, Forest and Environment and principal secretary local bodies of these states urging them to arrange for their own STPs to stop the release of untreated sewage water into the protected forest area.Since there is no sewage treatment plan in Kansal and Nayagaon so all the sewage of these areas are released into Chandigarh forest behind Sukhna lake. Untreated water of Saketri and Mahadevpur village, adjoining Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary is also being discharged into the Nepli Choe. The untreated water is likely to be mixing in the Sukhna Lake, one of the citys hot spot, so the water discharge must be stopped immediately, wrote Dabendra Dalai, CCF.Dalai said that a letter was written by his predecessor to these officials two years ago but received no response, not to talk of swift action by them. The Sambar deer caught skin disease by standing in the waterlogged area full of sewage to feed on Saccharum Munja vegetation. There can be other grave health hazards to the species and others which are yet to be examined, said forester Jitender Kumar Ranjan.According to Abdul Qayum, deputy conservator of forest, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) conducted a damage assessment of the area two days ago and found Carbon Organic Dissolve (COD) and Biological Organic Dissolve (BOD) level threatening to the ecosystem. Owing to this the forest department has begun some traditional method to cure water which has helped in reducing the BOD and COD level from 208 mg/l and 72 mg/l to 27 mg/l and 7 mg/lThe sewage water was bio-treated by constructing a 2.3 km water channel to divert water to shallow water body created under the City Forest Plan. Things like Saccharum Munja, rice straw bunch and gravel Iron ore were also put in the channel in order to increase the oxygen level in the water. Sand and gravel were put under the bed of channel as filtering agent.The roots of trees like Shisham, Sahtoot, Kikar, eucalyputurs, Dhak and so on also played role in absorbing some of the impurities and releasing oxygen into the sewage water before entering into the shallow water body, Qayum added."

The high court expressed surprise at the fact that the law department had not responded to a notice sent to it through registered post when the case was last heard on January 4, 2013.The division bench of chief justice K S Jhaveri and justice K R Mohapatra posted the matter in the last week of January 2019, giving the law department time till then to file a counter-affidavit to the PIL. The food supplies and consumer welfare department, however, had earlier filed a counter-affidavit to the PIL.The PIL  filed by high court lawyer Dillip Kumar Mohapatra in 2011  requests the court to direct the state government to grant stipend to young lawyers with an annual income of less than Rs 24,000 from the date of their enrolment. Most law students start their profession as lawyers after paying a huge amount (nearly Rs 23,000) towards registration fees for enrolment with the Orissa State Bar Council, incurring loans from their friends and relatives.The petition contends that it is difficult for young lawyers to survive after starting practice at the high court in Cuttack or the other district headquarters as most of them hail from poor families in rural areas. It urges the state government to provide essential commodities (wheat, rice , sugar, kerosene and so on) to junior lawyers at subsidized rates. In a counter-affidavit, the deputy secretary of the food supplies and consumer welfare department, Manjulata Swain, said, There is provision for establishment of retail shops in an area having at least 500 consumers in all gram panchayats/wards throughout the state. The advocates, if eligible, and bonafide Above Poverty Line (APL) consumers/card holders may get legitimate quota of essential commodities such as wheat and kerosene oil from the respective retail shop near their residence. She clarified that only Below Poverty Line (BPL) card holders were entitled to get rice, sugar and kerosene oil at subsidized rates.The PIL also urges the state government to build hostels for junior lawyers and law students in Cuttack and other districts."

The winners were selected from among nearly 250 students, researchers, entrepreneurs, NGOs and citizens from India and other countries. However, only one of the three innovations has been successfully implemented as part of a pilot project in Delhi. Mahila Housing SEWA Trust, in collaboration with the Tata Centre for Development at UChicago, Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicagos India team and Energy and Environment Lab, has deployed cool-roofing solutions in a west Delhi slum in an attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of using heat-reflective paints on roofs in lowering indoor temperatures and improving quality of life.Houses in low-income communities in India are often constructed with materials that absorb heat and require more energy to cool down. These communities often use cooling fans and air coolers for several hours a day, raising their energy bills. By shifting to passive cooling, these homes could be better adapted to days of extreme heat, which could make households less vulnerable to weather impact and improve their resilience against climate-change risks, Anna Agarwal, associate director, urban innovation, at Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicagos India team, told TOI.According to her, while these paints were widely used, there was little rigorous evidence on their effectiveness outside of small-scale pilots.The second innovation involved Chakr Innovation Pvt Ltd, which proposed to pilot a technology that, coupled with the exhaust pipe of diesel engines, absorbed PM emissions and converted this captured particulate matter into black ink and paints. In this project, the goal was to test the effectiveness of Chakrs device in reducing PM emissions, and assess if this technology was a cost-effective way of reducing diesel genset pollution.This project could not be implemented, as due to the DPCC ban on the use of diesel generators in Delhi, Chakr lost a significant number of sites in the study and had to identify and recruit additional ones. This led to considerable delays and, then, Chakr did not have resources for the project, the University Of Chicago official said.The other project, Charvesting, proposed to deploy Charvesters that would recycle rice straw into biochar with clean emissions using the biochar reactors. It was supposed to help farmers comply with existing air pollution laws at minimal cost and effort, increase soil productivity and restore depleted land. This project was not easy as there was no prior experience in implementing the technology at scale, and required engagement of multiple stakeholders. We worked with the winning team for over a year on the plan and the research design, but due to slow progress, we had to cancel the project, Agarwal said.Sampath Kumar from Tide Technocrats said: Even though the funding has stopped, we are still working on the technology part."

The family would make a trip to Moore Market in Madras where dresses, knick-knacks and gifts would be bought. Tanya Figredo, secretary, remembers London Stores where her mother buys veils for Christmas mass and handkerchiefs to match the dress. They would bump into relatives from Tiruchi. For shoes, they go to Fair Deal and Bellino at Vepery.Men in the family would wear similar shirts and trousers for Christmas as they would have been cut from the same bale, as it was easy on the purse, says Marcus Cleur, member of Flashback band. Back in Madurai, the men would head to either Peter Tailors or Bombay Tailors. For women, the tailors would come home. Each family had a favourite. Ms. Tanya remembers her father-in-law shoplifting the scissors from the tailor so that he would be forced to make their clothes first. The women would draw designs for frills and flounces. With the sewing machine humming in the background, it was time to make the plum cake, kulkul, a savoury, dhool dhool, a black rice halwa.The Anglo Indian women would take a jutka ride to Kandy Kalaimaligai Store for new curtains and bedcovers. The lady of the house would decide on the colour theme. If it was pink, the Christmas would see pink curtains for windows, pink floral bedsheets and vases with pink flowers. The boys would pedal to Vilangudi to cut and lug the Christmas tree. The rum-soaked raisins will wait for their time in the sun. Making the cake batter, Ms. Tanya says was a mans job.Once the flour was folded in along with marinated fruits, it was poured into tin containers, wrapped in butter paper and ferried on a jutka to Jeyaram or Raja Barley or Jupiter bakeries. After a few hours, the heady smell of freshly baked cakes would waft out of jutkas returning to Railway Colony.As guests dropped by, they were also served with home-made wine along with pieces of plum cake and seed cake. Another drink that was relished was Potello, made out of tonovin essence and sugar. It resembled and tasted like Bovonto. Ginger wine was a must on the seasons menu. No dinner was complete without pork sausage, brought from Tiruchi.On Christmas eve, Says Ms. Tanya, thin wires were much in demand - to perm and curl the hair of the girls. Even little strips of cloth were tightly wound around strands of hair and after a nights sleep, the girl would let loose a shower of little curls or bouncing rolls. And with the use of magic potion in Lacto Calamine bottles, ponds pink powder and lipstick, the women were ready to jive. The grand finale was on 25th, when after a breakfast of appam and stew, and turkey for lunch, it was time for the Christmas Ball on the wooden floor of the Railway Institute in the evening. Mr. Marcus recalls the three bands - Surfers, Bluebirds and Deep Reflection with a crooner - Honour Almedia, besides Valentine Vanspall, Bernard Vanspall and Bradley Woolridge, who also played the saxophone.Ms. Tanya remembers another female crooner Jackie Fernandez. These bands would set the floor on fire.But times have changed. Railway Institute has become a recreational area for railway staff. The Anglo Indian community itself has dispersed across the city. Now, a hall in a nearby hotel plays host to the Christmas Ball attended by the 250-odd Anglo-Indian families who are still in Madurai.While Mr. Marcus and his troupe still play country and western music, they also have a DJ who plays a mix for the young ones. With numbers shrinking and marriages outside the community becoming common, many who come for the Ball just watch the proceedings from the sidelines. At home, there are no more Christmas cards; artificial trees are lit up and though kulkul, and dhool dhool are passed around, few have started buying plum cakes. Dresses are bought online and perms and curlers have given way to hair straightening et al at the parlour.Today, Railway School does not break for vacation until Christmas eve and till the last day, the children find no time to serenade as they burn the midnight oil.The festive season would kick off in November itself and the family will make a trip to Moore Market in Madras where dresses, knick-knacks and gifts are boughtMoses PearcePresident, All India Anglo Indian Association-MaduraiOn Christmas eve, thin wires were much in demand - to perm and curl the hair of girls, and even little strips of cloth were tightly wound around strands of hairTanya FigredoSecretary, All India Anglo Indian Association-Madurai"
5ce54f16e8e3fc56af40b449,Rumblings over shifting of Archaeology Department,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rumblings-over-shifting-of-archaeology-department/article25816543.ece,2018-12-24,"There are rumblings in the State archaeology wing following the governments decision to shift the departments headquarters from Mysuru to Belagavi.The proposal to shift the office received Cabinet approval recently but the government Order regarding the same was yet to be issued and notified, said Commissioner of Archaeology Venktaesh.He said it was likely that even the office of the Directorate of Museums will be shifted from Bengaluru to Belagavi, but things would become clear once the official notification was issued. If the directors office was relocated to Belagavi, the Mysuru office would be left with a few engineers.Though a section of the staff welcomed the decision and said that shifting the office of the director would help give a renewed thrust to conservation of monuments in north Karnataka, others pointed out that monuments have received importance irrespective of the location of the headquarters. What mattered was the budgetary allocation, they argued.Incidentally, the head office of the State Archaeology Department was shifted from Mysuru to Hosapete in May 2000 precisely for the same reason: to give attention to monuments in northern parts of the State. But it was relocated to Mysuru in July 2000.Previous experienceRecalling the experience of shifting the Archaeology Department to Hosapete in 2000, the staff pointed out that functioning was affected as the heads had to frequently travel to Bengaluru for court cases, attending Assembly sessions, to apprise the government of various issues and more fund was spent on travelling than conservation.The department has a history of nearly 135 years and was established by the then princely State of Mysore in 1885 with B.L. Rice as its first director. Even when all important offices shifted to the State capital Bengaluru in 1956, the Archaeology Department was retained in Mysuru and shifting it to Belagavi will bring no tangible benefits, according to senior officials.Speaking on conditions of anonymity, the staff said there were offices of the deputy director of Archaeology in Dharwad and shifting the same to Belagavi was more prudent. Besides, the treasure trove containing invaluable artefacts were preserved in Mysuru and could not be relocated and this would create additional administrative problems, they said.Besides, Mysuru already has a full-fledged office with a museum and it is not practical to disturb it, said the staff."

For generations, they passed on their history, poetry, folksongs and ancient wisdom that way. Much of this vast treasure trove of knowledge and information has already been lost because of the dying art of storytelling and the zeal of the early Christian missionaries. Though they introduced script to the Naga people , the early missionaries saw everything traditional as anti-Christian and prohibited it, from traditional songs to hairstyles to rice beer, said Tuisem Ngakang, a doctorate on Naga culture and former assistant professor with Hindu College in Delhi University.So, camcorder in hand, 42-year-old Ngakang goes to distant Naga villages, interacts with elderly residents and requests them to sing old songs. Among Nagas, it is considered a duty of the elders to pass on what they know to youngsters. So, these people, mostly in their 70s and 80s, are only too happy to share, he said. Ngakang is on a mission  to document and preserve whatever is left of the fast-vanishing folklore of the indigenous people.A deep sense of urgency is visible among Naga tribes as they race against time to record whatever they can. But its not easy, going by the vast number of local languages and dialects they have. There are about 35 Naga tribes in Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal. D Koulie, professor of linguistics at Nagaland University , said there are 89 dialects in 89 villages of just the Angami Naga people. Koulie is also secretary of the Ura Academy which works to preserve Tenyidie  the mother language of 10 tribes, including Angami, Chakhesang, Rengma and Zeliang.In earlier times, when villages got congested, a member would venture out to establish another settlement. But it was taboo to set up a village without a new language. So, the same tribe would speak different languages in different villages, giving rise to numerous dialects. These dialects are morphologically similar but different phonologically. To preserve folklore, we ask students to visit their village homes, listen to the elderly and document stories and poetry, Koulie added. The Ura Academy regularly brings out journals and books documenting poetry, stories and dramas in Tenyidie. Easterine Kire, one of the foremost writers from the northeast, has collected 200 poems in Tenyidie that had been passed on orally.Tangkhul Nagas of Manipur have embarked on a similar mission. Members of the Hao Folklore Society (HFS), formed in March this year, have visited 15 Tangkhul villages in the last five months. We met senior residents, recorded and archived folksongs, folktales, histories and genealogies, said HFS president Raising Shimri. HFS also tries to preserve traditional houses and artefacts. Members of the society include lecturers, media professionals, photographers and lawyers, and live in cities across India but return to villages to document and record the oral history of their people. Armed with sound recorders, DSLR cameras or just their cellphones, HFS members fan out looking for elderly people and requesting them to perform traditional songs and dances.But there is a Himalayan task ahead of them  they need to cover about 206 Tangkhul villages, each with different dialects.Not all tribes, however, are so organised. The Konyak tribe of Mon district in Nagaland were the last to get introduced to the modern education system. Only some individuals have taken it upon themselves to preserve their folklore. Phejin Konyak has written a book on the last of the tattooed headhunters of her tribe, describing in detail the rituals involved and what the tattoo patterns mean. It is a solo effort, said Phejin.Nzanmongi Jasmine Patton, an assistant professor at Gargi College in Delhi, too has taken the solo route. She has published a collection of 30 stories from her Lotha tribe in A Girl Swallowed By A Tree: Lotha Naga Tales Retold. Though Lotha Nagas have Kyong Academy that is supposed to work towards preserving their culture, the 35-year-old writer said most effort regarding documentation is being made by Lothas individually.As early missionaries prohibited institutions like morungs (traditional Naga youth hostels) and indigenous rituals, songs and music too disappeared soon. We have lost most of ritual music associated with events like rice-pounding or house-building,"" said Ngakang.Koulie, who has written 21 books of which 18 are in Tenyidie, said, If you look at school curriculum, there is no material on tradition and folklore. Every Sunday we gather for sermons, but have no time for traditional stories, he said.H Khehovi Yepthomi, advisor to the Nagaland government for tourism, art and culture, admitted nothing much has been done till now and Naga folklore is going to be extinct if proactive steps aren't taken. I have asked cultural officers to identify heritage sites and look for experts willing to document oral history. The government has now decided to hold three-day mini Hornbill festivals in all the districts spread all though the year.But hope comes with anxiety. Shimri said, Time is against us. It is disappointing when we reach a particular village to find a majority of the elderly have passed away, and along with them stories that have got buried forever."

IRRI-Indias success had begun with the introduction of IR8  high-yielding rice variety known as miracle rice which helped save India from a famine in the 1960s.According to an IRRI report, though IRRI and India have collaborated for over five decades, Modi was the first Indian Prime Minister to visit IRRI headquarters in the Philippines in November 2017, where he discussed agricultural innovations and research advances for the rice sector. He had also inaugurated the Resilient Rice Field Laboratory at the IRRI headquarters.According to the report, India began its partnership with IRRI through the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1967. The partnership resulted in advances in developing disease- and insect-resistant varieties suited to various rice environments, developing and releasing hybrid rice varieties bred through government and private sector programs, streamlining rice production practices, and improving post-harvest technologies for improved sustainability and productivity.From 2009 to 2012, ICAR and IRRI worked together on 37 research projects, including two major regional initiatives  Stress-Tolerant Rice for Africa and South Asia (STRASA) project and Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA).Indias extensive partnership with IRRI involves about 250 institutions all over the country. The IRRI South Asia Regional Centre is a regional facility that supports research collaboration, training, and service provision to institutions, scientists, and other stakeholders from India and other South Asian and African nations.IRRI scientist Ashish Pathak said that the centre aims to deliver rice research expertise by producing stress tolerant rice varieties and conducting trainings in mechanization.It will support research collaboration, training, and service provision to institutions, scientists, and other stakeholders from India and other South Asian and African nations.It also aims at enabling knowledge transfer through short courses on rice-based agri-food systems and other IRRI education products within the region.Chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi visited the centre on Saturday to take stock of the preparations for PMs visit."

The GI-tagged Pokkali is a saltwater-tolerant paddy grown in the coastal fields of Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts. Endemic to central Kerala, the variety is now grown in only over 5,000 hectares, a drop from over 25,000 hectares a few decades ago, due to high labour cost and poor returns.The single-season paddy is raised in saltwater fields between June and November followed by a season of fish-farming. After the harvest, the paddy stubble in the fields acts as food and shelter for shrimp and small fish. Fish excreta and scales, along with the decomposed stubble, provide excellent natural manure for another season of Pokkali.Today, this farming tradition is under threat. While Pokkali rice fetches a good Rs. 110 a kg, the production does not compensate the farmer for the strenuous, labour-intensive cultivation. Lack of labour has forced farmers to try using mechanised tillers and rice planters for cultivation lately, but harvest remains labour-intensive.Pokkali rice is consumed locally. With just a few farmers growing the crop now, local societies, cooperative banks and MGNREGA groups have stepped in to protect this variety of rice, which the local people believe has medicinal properties."
5ce5594ee8e3fc56af40b895,Invisible people: Aadhaar versus particularly vulnerable tribal groups,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/invisible-people-aadhaar-versus-particularly-vulnerable-tribal-groups/cid/1679711,2018-12-24,"More than 40 per cent of respondents in a recent survey reported Aadhaar-related problems such as ration cards being cancelled for lack of Aadhaar linkage, children being refused admission for lack of Aadhaar, NREGA wage payments being rejected, and so on (PTI)Particularly vulnerable tribal groups, earlier known as primitive tribal groups, are the sort of people you may never meet unless you take the trouble to look for them. In Jharkhand, they live in small hamlets scattered over the nooks and crannies of the states undulating forests. Without a purpose and some local guidance, it is unlikely that anything will take you there.Last month, the Sahayata Kendra (help centre for rural workers) in Manika block of Latehar district completed a house-to-house survey of all the PVTG families in the block, and also in the adjacent block of Satbarwa in Palamu district. We found 325 PVTG households  spread over 18 hamlets  in these two blocks, compared with 256 listed in the Socio-Economic and Caste Census of 2011. All of them belong to the Parhaiya community. They came across as uprooted people, who have been deprived of their traditional resources and are now struggling to latch on to new sources of livelihood.PVTG families in the area used to subsist mainly on forest-based activities such as hunting, gathering, selling minor forest products (roots, berries, wood, mahua, tendu, lac, herbs, among others) and manufacturing simple items from straw, bamboo and such. Not so long ago, the forests of Jharkhand were dense with flora and teeming with wildlife, but recent environmental degradation has taken a toll. Today, most PVTG families in Manika and Satbarwa subsist on a little farming, casual labour, and residual forest-based occupations such as making ropes or baskets. Some of them work as seasonal labourers in the rice fields or brick kilns of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and occasionally migrate to more distant places.Public facilities in PVTG hamlets are abysmal, in spite of some recent progress. None of the 18 hamlets we visited seemed to have a well-functioning school. Few had their own anganwadis, keeping child development services out of reach of most PVTG children. Health centres, banks and administrative offices are far away and public transport is nil. Government officials rarely visit these hamlets. Isolation, poverty and low education levels have turned PVTGs into sitting ducks for exploitative contractors and middlemen.In this situation, PVTG families depend critically on two entitlements for their survival: social security pensions and food rations from the public distribution system.Under a Supreme Court order of May 2, 2003, in the right to food case, Antyodaya ration cards are to be distributed to all PVTG households. This entitles them to 35 kgs of foodgrain per month from the PDS at a nominal price; in fact, for free in the case of Jharkhand. Among the 325 households we surveyed, 87 per cent were on the Antyodaya list. Further, Antyodaya households reported that they were receiving the bulk of their PDS entitlements: about 33 kgs per month on an average. This is good news of sorts in a state where PDS grain used to be siphoned off with abandon by corrupt dealers. Even the reduced levels of pilferage, however, are unacceptable, and a significant minority of PVTG households is still deprived of Antyodaya cards.Turning to pensions. All PVTG families in Jharkhand are entitled to a pension of Rs 600 per month  if not under an existing old-age, widow or disability pension scheme, then under the state governments special pension scheme for PVTGs. The survey, however, reveals that only two thirds of all PVTG households in the area are receiving a pension. One reason for this is that many pensions have been discontinued in recent years owing to Aadhaar-related problems. The main problem is that all pensioners in Jharkhand are now required to meet the e-KYC (electronic Know Your Customer) banking norms. This means that Aadhaar must be seeded in their bank account and also that the seeding must be verified through biometric authentication. In the absence of biometric facilities at the bank, pensioners have to go to a Pragya Kendra (customer service centre) for authentication, take a certificate from there to the bank, and then hope that the bank will complete the formalities in good time. Lapses, errors, glitches and delays abound. For pensioners, especially for the elderly, these hurdles are daunting. Many of them do not know what they are supposed to do or how to seek assistance if a problem arises. None of this has changed  so far  after the recent Supreme Court judgment on Aadhaar.In our small sample of 325 households, 28 pensioners were currently deprived of their pension, mainly owing to Aadhaar-related problems. Another 30 or so had been temporarily deprived of their pension for several months, sometimes more than a year, at the time when they were struggling to meet the e-KYC norms. In cases of temporary discontinuation, there are no retrospective payments for the gap months after a pension is resumed.The discontinuation of pensions is just one among a long series of Aadhaar-related problems that emerged from the survey. Examples include inability to get an Aadhaar card because of blindness or deformed hands, ration cards being cancelled for lack of Aadhaar linkage, children being refused admission for lack of Aadhaar, NREGA wage payments being rejected, bank accounts being frozen for lack of e-KYC, and problems of biometric authentication at the Pragya Kendras. More than 40 per cent of the respondents had experienced problems of this sort.Aside from the pathologies of Aadhaar, PVTG families have to contend with merciless harassment from local exploiters. In Uchvabal village, a para-teacher, Krishna Ram, was caught trying to siphon off childrens scholarships. In Sewdhara, a PDS dealer, Dinesh Rai, measures food rations using a recycled tin instead of a weighing machine, pruning them to 31 kg per month instead of 35 kg. Pragya Kendra operators routinely take bribes for services, and one of them (in Namudag) tried to extort Rs 2,000 from an illiterate woman who needed help to apply for a pension. Another one, in Rewat Khurd, even siphoned off a Rs 56,000 housing subsidy from the account of an elderly widow who blindly lent her thumbprint for this purpose.These and other acts of exploitation were brought up at a public hearing held in Manika on December 13. Block-level officials, however, did their best to protect the exploiters. The block supply officer, for instance, acted like Dinesh Rais well-wisher. Hopefully, the district administration will crack the whip, but who knows, crooks often have patrons in high places.The experience of the Parhaiyas in Latehar and Palamu confirms something we have already learnt from other states: the PVTGs need special support and it is perfectly possible to help them. The existing support systems, however, are patchy and inadequate. Indeed, in spite of receiving some assistance from pensions and the PDS, the Parhaiyas continue to live in the shadow of hunger. Almost half of the respondents said that some members of the households had to sleep hungry at some point in the preceding three months, and as many as 10 per cent said that they had gone hungry many times in that period. The situation was better among households that had a ration card and a pension, but even they were not exempt from food insecurity. There is a strong case for raising pension amounts and expanding Antyodaya entitlements without delay. Strict action against those who exploit PVTGs would also help. Taking a longer view, PVTG hamlets need better public facilities, especially well-functioning schools and anganwadis. Failing that, PVTG children are unlikely to live much better than their parents when they grow up.The author is Visiting Professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University"

The New York TimesSprawled on a bamboo mat, Supattra Inthirat closed her eyes as her father massaged her hard arms with oil and menthol. In preparation for her 15th muay Thai bout, her father whispered a prayer into her ear.When Supattra, a 12-year-old fighter known as Pancake, faced her rival and 400 fans under halogen lights, she would be fighting for a purpose: $60, almost a half of a months salary for Thai families in this region.She will be a champion, he said. She must train early to build up her boxing bones.Across Thailand, muay Thai is a hallowed style of kickboxing propelled by both rich and poor. For the poor, it can be a form of social mobility, a means for muscled young boxers to fight their families way into the burgeoning middle class. For the rich, its a brutal gambling form in which tens of thousands of dollars can be won and lost each night.Last month those worlds collided just south of Bangkok when Anucha Tasako, 13, died of a brain hemorrhage after being knocked out in a muay Thai fight. Video of the knockout showed five fierce blows to the head, then Anucha limply buckling to the ground as the referee tried to stop the action. Two days later, Anucha died in a hospital. He had fought an astonishing 174 bouts since the age of 8.Now Thailand has been left to reconsider the brutality of a sport involving underage fighters and the shadowy gambling economy built around it.Its child labor and child abuse, said Dr Jiraporn Laothamatas, a neuroradiologist leading the charge to ban boxing by children. Last month she released a seven-year study on the effect of muay Thai on childrens brains, showing a steady drop in IQ and brain function for those who fight. These kids earn. They feed their families and their promoters with their winning. We are destroying our children for sport.Anuchas death stirred a wave of shock and anger across the nation, leading Thai lawmakers to propose a measure that could put stringent limits on fights and bar children younger than 12 from competitive boxing.This will destroy muay Thai, said Dr Sudhichai Chokekijchai, a doctor for professional boxers in Bangkok and a fight enthusiast. We should be focused on prevention instead of pushing kids away. They are fighting for their lives.Supattra Inthirat, 12, known as Pancake, during a fight at a small local fighting stage in That Phanom, Thailand. The New York TimesThe national rules state that boxers over 15 are required to register to fight officially. For competitors under that age, the rules are vague, requiring only parental permission and offering little guidance on gambling and safety.Most fights happen off the books, though. A Thai investigative journalism centre reported that only 10,373 child fighters had registered between 2010 to 2017, while according to boxing officials nearly 200,000 children under 15 regularly compete.Its in our blood to fight, Sudhichai said. These laws will only push people away from doing it safely. These kids are healthy, they stay away from drugs and crimes. How will the government support them if they take fighting away?Muay Thai is known as the art of eight limbs, mixing kicking, punching, kneeing and elbowing to defeat an opponent. Fights are typically five rounds of three minutes of fighting with no headgear and competitors wearing 10 ounce gloves. Over the past 400 years, it has grown from a local sport form into a worldwide phenomenon popularised by films, video games and fitness enthusiasts.In Thailand, muay Thai competitions have managed to stay outside the child protection and labour laws, which designate that only salaried children are considered workers. Money won in muay Thai fights is considered an award and is legal.In the poorer and more rural regions of Thailand, where child boxing has its strongest following, that money can become an important buoy. Compared with families that may earn an average of $200 a month working farms and rice paddies, a budding child fighter can bring in $60 to $600 for a victory  or even more for a knockout.Do you want them to play golf? said Sukit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who defends fighter rights. Every famous professional boxer starts at 7 years old.Spectators in the stands of the Rajadamnern Stadium in Bangkok. The New York TimesPancakes career has had a promising start. Girls are relatively new to muay Thai, but comprise a growing sector, and Pancake has won 12 of her last 14 competitions. Coming from a middle-class family, she is one of the luckier boxers, able to train with her father, a former fighter himself, in their makeshift home gym.On the night of her fight, she climbed into the ring to face another 12-year-old girl. Before the bell, the two wore stony faces and performed a swirling, traditional warm-up dance. Over a loudspeaker, an announcer called out the nicknames of others on the lineup: Super Small, Mint, Diamond Lighting, Diamond Cactus and Sidewalk Flower.After five rounds of flailing arms and legs, the two girls walked off, faces sweaty and battered. The judges unanimous decision: Pancake had lost. Her father gathered her things.Shell need to train harder, he said.c.2018 New York Times News Service"
5ce55958e8e3fc56af40b8a6,Is there turkey on your Christmas menu?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/is-there-turkey-on-your-christmas-menu/cid/1679629,2018-12-23,"Sanjit Mondal is mixing something in a plastic tub. Soyabean, bhutta (corn) rice flour, shutki machh or Bombay Duck (a kind of dried fish), seed meal, a mineral and vitamin powder, he rattles off the ingredients list. This is turkey feed and we are at Mondals turkey farm in Sodepur, 20 kilometres north of Calcutta.He continues, This I have to feed them four times a day. They grow very fast; attain maturity by six-and-a-half months and can lay eggs anytime after that.Mondal has been rearing turkey in his four-storey house the past three years. I find him after a spot of reverse investigation. The starting point, a shopping mall advertisement about pre-ordering Christmas meats.Indeed, it is Christmas season and our man is very busy. The turkey is a relatively new entrant to the seasons menu but one that is gaining in popularity. Mondal has just got an order for 100 birds from Siliguri. Some of the other places from where he gets regular orders are Coochbehar, Calcutta, Malda and North Dinajpur.People seem to think this meat is healthy, at least that is what Mondal has gathered. He says, The market in West Bengal is still premature. The demand is low and prices are high. And that perhaps explains the presence of the shy quails, the robust desi roosters, jet black Kadaknath roosters and plump ducks on his farm.The longish hall on the first floor is partitioned into several netted enclosures. One enclosure is chock-a-block with 50 turkeys  there are two more enclosures on the second floor, I am told. The gaggle of birds are most odd-looking. Pale pink head, somewhat like a bald pate, a long neck  part pink, the rest black  and body covered with jet black plumes with white trimmings.There is one of the flock that stands out though. A handsome bird that struts and swaggers from one corner of the enclosure to the other, occasionally stopping to preen. It is quite obvious that he is upset with the advent of inquisitive strangers into what is his private space. He rolls his eyes and the pink of his neck and chin appears flushed  from displeasure, most likely. Mondal cannot say if it is a gobbler (male) or a hen. It is difficult to tell them apart till the birds are about six months old. These birds are younger.The TelegraphMondal, who has been into livestock farming for many years now, bought his first batch of turkeys only three years ago. I got 55 birds at Rs 600 each from Midnapore. But after that I decided I would breed eggs on my own, rear birds and sell them myself. That way, it is more cost-effective. Today, he also manufactures and sells the breeding apparatus.He talks excitedly, quite knowledgeably  clearly no one has had a turkey conversation with him before. No, he cannot say what triggered the turkey farming trend. The bird is not native to India; there are two breeds available here  one from Holland and another from the US.But Mondal holds forth confidently on other specifics  how a turkey is not banquet-fit, in terms of size as well as taste, unless it is at least eight months old. That is when it weighs eight to 10 kilos. More facts: by the time a bird is two years old, it is full-grown and weighs about 20 kilos, the average lifespan of a turkey is 13 years, and so on and so forth.Mondal says a female bird lays about 100 eggs a year but makes an impatient mother-to-be; wont warm the eggs diligently, leading to a lot of wasted eggs.The birds are also apparently most quarrelsome, especially the male of the species. Says Mondal, During breeding season, when we put both the sexes in the same enclosure, the gobblers are forever pecking at each other. We have to be careful. It is not easy to prise them apart. I have lost a couple of birds this way.And has he ever cooked turkey meat himself? Mondals expression relaxes for the first time. Smiling and a tad shy, he says, Yes. Once during Vishwakarma Puja. We cooked it just like we cook chicken kasha (a dry dish). But later someone who lives in the US told me this is not the way to cook a turkey. And then very swiftly his expression changes and he says earnestly, But you know, it didnt taste bad this way either. It was quite good, in fact. In India, curry works."

We are ready to accommodate as many bovines as posisble in our cow shelter, he said, while talking to TOI on Friday. He added that his shelter was already home to more than 11,000 bovines, mostly cows.In recent past, a 65-year-old man was mauled by a stray bull near Durgiana Abadi. Earlier, cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had a close brush with a stray bull during his visit to Durgiana Temple Bhagirath said all cows were provided feed and shelter with offerings received from people. We have stocked turi (thrashed wheat straw) and prali rice stubble) in sufficient quantity, he added. He said devotees also made offerings of green fodder every day We are of view that these bovines are also born with the blessings of Almighty. So, it is our duty to look after these cows which provide us milk while living and leather after death, said Baba Sher Singh , an associate of Baba Bharthia.When contacted, MC health officer Ajay Kanwar said they had already sent over 100 cows to the cow shelter. If need be, we will again send cows to his shelter . We are also making our own cow shelter in Fatahpur. Once it is completed, we will divide the stray cattle between our shelter and that of babas, he said.Kulwant Singh Ankhi, patron of Amritsar Vikas Manch, said it would be better for authorities and officials of C to shift stray bovines to the shelter. The MC will only have to arrange transport in that scenario, he said.Ankhi added that hundreds of stray bovines were wandering on city roads, inconveniencing commuters."

They are mostly built by the family members themselves, sometimes, with a helping hand from neighbour of the same tribe in erecting poles and laying the roof.Eega Ramanammas house is a model, meeting all the features of the mud-walled house - with three rooms including a hall, bedroom under one thatched roof. It has a separate fireplace made of mud and a kitchen meant both for cooking and storing grains and water. The motifs of various floral designs and birds are drawn on the floor with rice powder. They use chalk powder to draw the motifs on the walls.The life of the roof laid using grass procured from the river is at least five years while mud-walls sustain the same period. Cow dung is applied on the walls occasionally to maintain the smoothness, Ms. Ramanamma told The Hindu , daughter of a crab hunter.A majority of the houses have trees and flowering plants. Some houses have a bathroom that is covered with plastic bags, indicative of their hygiene awareness.Pollution-free livingOther Yanadi tribal families said that they enjoy the fresh and unpolluted air on the bank of the irrigation channel and take the responsibility of maintaining the house.Presently, the Yanadi families live in a pathetic condition, with no access to proper planned house and hygienic conditions in the rest of the Krishna district. Having a secured livelihood from crab hunting, the group of Yanadi families here has set an example by creating a healthy and sophisticated housing facility for them in comparison to their tribal cousins in the rest of the district.Both men and women are engaged in crab hunting in the mangrove cover including the Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary.The collected crabs are directly exported to Asian countries for consumption and cultivation in brackishwater ponds in Krishna district.However, this tribal group is yet to realize the importance of education. Despite various serious attempts to bring the children back to school, parents still want their children to accompany them during crab hunting."

While she procured only five kg of bitter gourd from the farmer in Gannavaram of Krishna district on the opening day, she she sold 37 kg on Friday evening.Like her stall, 56 organic vegetable, fruit and millet stalls have been allotted space by the government at Rythu Bazaars  markets where farmers directly sell their produce to buyers without middlemen across urban areas in the State.Hari Babu, a lift operator by profession, says he made the switch to organic vegetables two years ago. I care for my health and have been buying organic products for two years now. Prices here are Rs. 3-5 cheaper than in supermarkets, he says.For vegetables that are not grown locally in Gannavaram, Nunna, Kankipadu or Penamaluru, products are sourced from West Godavari and Srikakulam districts, and even from Karnataka.Networks of farmers like Go Adharitha Sangam, a farmer producer organisation (FPO), in every region helps them source goods from their peers in other areas. Organic custard apples, for instance, are sourced from Srikakulam district to Vijayawada, says horticulture officer Chandu Joseph Sundaran.Multiple challengesThe State has roped in the International Competence Centre for Organic Agriculture (ICCOA) and the Sikkim State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Ltd. (SIMFED) to farm and market produce from 10,000 hectares of certified land. A farmer gets certification if he/she has been practicing the method for at least three years, according to Horticulture Commissioner Chiranjiv Choudhary.Lack of certification remains a challenge. Except for rice and millets, the products sold at Rythu Bazaars are uncertified. It is mostly word of mouth and the trust of customers that keeps these stalls going, Mr. Choudhary says, adding that farms in transition that have not been in organic farming for three years are supplying to the bazaars.Moreover, in the country, certification is done by third party agencies that are recognised by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA). These agencies ask for a hefty fee, which, if farmers pay, would inflate prices at the bazaars.At the Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazaar here, Vijaya Babus rice stall wears a deserted look.Out of varieties like sugar-free, raw, organic and black, hes sold just four packets of organic rice priced at Rs. 60 a kg, which is twice the price of regular rice.A bazaar official says the quality of organic rice supplied by the government is not good enough.Ms. Gayathri says buyers sometimes return with purchase saying the same vegetable is being sold for cheaper price at another stall. We have fixed rates. Those who know what organic is, dont bargain, she says, adding that mostly office-goers, who are aware of the benefits of organic produce, are her regular customers.The government had asked farmers to sell produce at just Rs. 5 more than the price at which they procured it. However, they are selling at twice the rates to increase their margins as the yield in organic farming is lesser, says Mr. Sundaran.Among districts, Krishna has 20 stalls at all bazaars, Visakhapatnam has 14 at 14, Nellore has 4 at 10, East Godavari has 15 at 4, Chittoor has 2 at 2, Kurnool has 5 at 2, Kadapa has 1 at 1, Anantapur has 1 at 1, Srikakulam has 2 at 1 and Prakasam has 4 at 1.

She had gone to the Khan Market eatery, and enjoyed her chorizo and baby potatoes with wilted spinach and poached egg so much that she had a second helping of the same dish. I am, at present, not on speaking terms with chorizos and other porky products, but still thought Sly Granny deserved a dekko. Then, just a few days ago, we got a call from a dear friend.

I asked around, and was told to take the middle lane, turning left if we were approaching it from Bahrisons. Sly Granny is on the left, on the first floor. The address is 4, Khan Market, and the phone number for booking your tables (which you should do, because it was rather busy on a weekday, too) is 011-4905 8941.The dcor is pleasing, with nice old-style posters on the staircase and the walls. And on the window sills they have lots of fresh herbs growing, which are added to salads and other dishes, we were told by the helpful servers. Sly Granny, which has a branch in Bangalore, opened in Delhi in August.We asked for chicken salad with walnut and celery  from the small plates section. Our friend wanted fish moilee with curry leave rice and kasundi jhal muri, and the niece, mushroom and black olive tortellini. My wife asked for the roast chicken with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus and I, the grilled fish. Mine was a Calcutta betki, which is a fish that I enjoy, and the friends moilee was sole. And for dessert, since we were told brie en croute would take some time, we asked for lava cake and affogato.Crispy textureEvery dish was superb. The walnuts in the salad were crunchy, and the chicken had infused in the flavours of celery. The moilee was a bit different, and we had been told that the fish would be crumb fried. So the dish consisted of a little mound of flavoured rice with two pieces of golden fried fish on top, and some sauces on the side. The friend loved it. My fish was delicious, too. It was firm within with a crispy texture and came with a lemon-garlic butter sauce on a bed of lip-smacking buttered and mashed potatoes and topped with micro greens (from the window sill!). I squeezed a piece of lemon over it, and it was like nirvana.The mushroom and black olive tortellini was nice and rich, and had a sauce prepared with basil cream and brown butter and flavoured with sage and toasted pine nuts. I had a bit of the chicken (with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus)  and thought it was amazing. It had a crispy skin, while the flesh was juicy and tender. We ended our meal with a rich lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream, and the affogato, a nice mix of bitter and sweet tastes.This is a place that is known for its food  its Salmon Gravalax (salmon cured with salt, sugar and dill), pulled chicken tacos with tomato chutney and pickled onions, duck ragout tagliatelle and black pepper salmon. But I know what I am going to go back for once pigs and I resume our happy relationship (happy for me, that is, alas not so happy for the poor pigs). I will have their biscuits and gravy  buttermilk biscuits, pork sausages, sage and bacon gravy.I am counting the days. 10, 9, 8..."

It is shocking that religious prejudices can rob children of their fundamental right to food in a secular country like India. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that a nutritious and hearty mid-day meal can reduce dropout rates in schools along with checking malnutrition among children.Given that India is home to 48.2 million malnourished children with stunted growth, the careless disregard towards the menu of mid-day meals reveals the establishments apathy. Eggs are highly nutritious. Further, a boiled egg cannot be adulterated in any way, making it the perfect component of welfare schemes. Add to this the fact that five million eggs reportedly crack or go bad in India owing to the lack of adequate cold storages and the absence of the protein from mid-day meals seems more senseless.The purpose of the mid-day meal scheme is to provide nutritious food to students and address the problem of malnutrition. The government should ensure that no prejudice stands in the way of this.Sujit De,CalcuttaSir  The task of deciding the items on the menu for a mid-day meal should lie solely with the nutritionists or public health experts. The human resource development ministry or any private agency contracted by it to serve mid-day meals should not have a say in what the children will eat. It has been reported that Akshay Patra, the organization which provides mid-day meals to over 1.76 million children in 14,700 schools, has deliberately kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for its own religious beliefs. But according to the agency, the meals it supplies comply with the norms of the HRD ministry.The government must remember that its decisions affect a vast number of people critically. The least it can do is set up a commission of experts to determine food items which will provide the highest amount of nutrition to children from underprivileged families.Sukhamay Biswas,CalcuttaSir  Akshay Patra has been praised for the nutritious, clean and hygienic food that it serves to children as part of mid-day meals. The controversy around the inclusion of eggs, onions and garlic is needless, especially since the eggs that are mass-produced these days in factories are often laced with antibiotics. Worldwide, there has been a shift in consumption patterns towards plant-based food and beverages. These are widely believed to be more natural, sustainable and healthy. Akshay Patra should be allowed to continue running its well-managed programme.H.N. Ramakrishna,BangaloreFlavours of BengalSir  Bengalis have always taken pride in having a nuanced palate. But time  and the Green Revolution?  seems to have tamed their taste buds. A plate of pulao served at a famous Bengali establishment convinced me of this. The short-grained, sweet and sticky variety of rice known as gobindobhog that was synonymous with pulao has been replaced in most places with the long-grained basmati. No one can deny that basmati is flavourful, but can it ever replace the taste of parboiled rice with mangsher jhol? The ubiquitousness of basmati is killing the vibrance of Bengali cuisine.Sanchari Mukherjee,CalcuttaParting shotSir  Amitav Ghosh should be congratulated for winning the coveted Jnanpith award. He has the rare distinction of being the first Indian writer in English to bag the prestigious prize. Ghoshs writings paint vivid pictures on a wide variety of themes like travel, the unique problems of the diaspora, post-colonialism, postmodernism, eco-criticism, history, memory, time, political struggle, communal violence and loss, among other things.Ghoshs research is always deep and illuminating and his books like The Shadow Lines and The Hungry Tide tug at the readers heartstrings. The award that he has just been given is well-deserved indeed. One expects many more enriching books from Ghosh.Dileep D. Anand,Alappuzha, Kerala"

Native Americans marked December's full moon as the beginning of the coldest part of the year.The American Meteor Society says the Ursids should be visible in the mid-Northern Hemisphere. At the peak there should be about 11 sporadic meteors per hour just before dawn.Friday also marks the first day of winter in the Northern Hemisphere when it will pass through its longest night of the year.The Google Doodle features a ""mousy"" animated figure ice skating above a mouse hole. It appears, he has collected food for hibernation. The animation ends with the figure rolling into the hole while covered in snow.In India, winter solstice will take place at 3.53 a.m. on December 22 and will be marked by a host of religious observances and celebrations.On this day, the North Pole angles farthest away from the sun, the Google blog explained. The sun would be at its lowest position throughout the Northern Hemisphere sky.People around the globe have celebrated this astronomical milestone for centuries.In Ireland, people gather days before the solstice at Newgrange -- a massive gravesite that is more than 5,000 years old. Crowds selected by lottery wait for a chance to see the sunrise light up the ancient passage tomb.At Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England, large crowds gather to celebrate and capture the moment when the sun directly aligns with the famous stones.In China, where they call the Winter Solstice Dongzhi Festival, people enjoy rice balls called tang yuan, which translates to ""family reunion"". This treat is said to bring prosperity and unity-something all of us can enjoy on this auspicious day."

Kamalakannan said that the Congress has decided to take corrective steps, including procurement of paddy, to improve the livelihood of farmers.The recent Assembly elections have proved the might of farming community. We have taken note of the issues pertaining to farmers in the Union Territory. The government has constituted a committee headed by the Development Commissioner to look into procurement of paddy from farmers, Minister for Agriculture R. Kamalakannan told The Hindu .One of the first steps that the Congress took after assuming office was to waive farm loans totalling Rs. 19 crore, he said.For the last few years, neither the territorial administration nor the Food Corporation of India had been procuring paddy from farmers in Puducherry and Karaikal regions. The farmers were selling paddy at Rs. 250 lower than the minimum support price, he said.We are aware of the plight of paddy cultivators. The main issue before farmers was that we were not able to procure rice from farmers. So, a committee headed by the Development Commissioner has been constituted to look into various aspects of paddy procurement, he said.The main issue in procurement, he said, was the loss the government sometime incurred while selling it in the open marker after procurement. There was a Central scheme to reimburse the loss suffered by the State government, he said.The government had been planning to start paddy procurement from the beginning of next year, Mr. Kamalakannan said.Govt. to pay interestThe government would issue a notification soon to bear the interest of loan taken by farmers from cooperative societies. The societies charged 4% to 7% as interest from farmers. If the interest of farmers could be absorbed by the government, the burden of farmers to repay the loan would come down, he added.The government had started transferring the subsidy to farmers account for buying fertilizers, pesticides and tractors. The government had decided not to insist on buying a particular brand of tractor. Instead, the farmer would be given the choice to from a panel of companies, he added.A notification had been issued recently to include banana cultivation under insurance cover. The government was committed to the welfare of farmers by assisting them to improve the yield, he added."

Nalgonda to Devarakonda is 60 kms, and from here to the farthest village or mandal is another 40 or 50 kms. Youth for lack of education facilities or jobs take to driving share taxis to Hyderabad, a member of Devarakonda Jilla Sadhana Samithi says.Villagers of Ammanabolu near Narketpally are another group, even willing to boycott the panchayat elections if it is not declared a separate mandal soon.Leaders from all groups and levels are upping the ante in several forms  releasing wall posters, organising sit-ins and road blockades, petitioning Mandal Revenue Officers and writing to the Chief Minister."

Though eager to outsource it to SHGs, schools do have apprehensions about accountability in the way the system will be run. TOI has learnt that the issue will be discussed in the principals association meet in January.A principal of an aided school told TOI on condition of anonymity that the idea of outsourcing was not a bad one considering the hassles schools have to deal with. We have to coordinate with the officials who deal with MDM and maintain records of each and every transaction plus students fed. One of the office staff is continuously engaged in this operation only, so one would feel that its best to hand outsource this operation, the principal said.TOI has been told many schools are being urged by MDM officials to select SHG as their vendors. The principal, added  I hope the money and raw materials are properly accounted for. Pilferage can happen very easily with the school not being directly involved.The current set up for aided schools is such that schools get rice directly from the government. The rice sacks are delivered every month straight to the campus from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns, with no monetary exchange happening between schools and FCI. The quantity of rice sacks to be delivered is conveyed by the school to the education department, which then informs FCI about it. This is the only part of the purchasing process that is common for both urban and rural schools.Vegetables, pulses and other cooking materials have to be purchased by urban schools which then get reimbursed within two or three months. In rural areas, schools have to simply pick up the ingredients from designated shops and the education department takes care of the payment.Almost all rural schools have cultivated kitchen gardens and use fresh vegetables in their MDM. Apart from SHG, even NGO Akshay Patra is providing MDM to certain schools as pilot project."

Mother Dairy will source from major organic goods producing states, including Maharashtra , Madhya Pradesh and Sikkim, sources told TOI . A Mother Dairy spokesperson did not reply to an email.In addition, a range of organic kitchen ingredients such as pulses, rice , spices, millets, dry fruits and wheat flour are being introduced as per the regulations of National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP), Government of India and FSSAI's Jaivik Bharat norms. The company plans to further expand its organic portfolio in near future.The Rs 4,000-crore domestic organic products market, consisting packaged food, textiles and personal and beauty care, has been growing at around 25% annually and is expected to touch Rs 10,000-Rs 12,000 crore in two years, according to an Ernst & Young report.Despite its steady growth, the organic products market in India remains niche and relegated to affluent urban consumers. For instance, the domestic per capita consumption of organic produce is pegged at around Rs 80 per year.Mother Dairy currently operates around 300 Safal stores across Delhi-NCR."

Though she didnt share the division, this amounts to roughly Rs 142 crores in welfare handouts per year.But the reality in the tea gardens of the state remains grim.The tea industry is the second largest employer in India. In its ranks are 3.5 lakh workers from North Bengal. Crippled by starvation, unemployment, low wages, inadequate medical facility and to top it off corruption, the lives of plantation workers here has turned into a brewing cup of misery.The picturesque tea gardens in the Dooars region of Bengal spread over Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts account for 330 registered big tea gardens where 186559 families reside.The tea business that witnessed a boom in the mid-1990s is now facing an existential crisis. As per Tea Board data, the number of tea plantations in north India, including in Bengal and the seven northeastern states, had scaled up from 3141 in 1994 to 36836 in 1999. In the Dooars alone, this number went up from 168 to 532 during this period.But the cost of running many of these major plantations shot up and an increasing number of them were shut down over the past decade. This led to many second-generation workers losing their jobs. Uneducated and in search of a living, many turned to breaking stones to make money.Out of the 32 defunct tea gardens across the Dooars, the condition of Nirpania tea garden in Alipurduar is reportedly the worst. Madhu, Bandapani, Dheklapara, Lankapara and Dimdima tea estates have also been shut down for years. With no immediate chance of re-opening, the workers are staring at a bleak future. Taking advantage of their destitution, local contractors, who operate within the closed tea estates, have started exploiting the workers by paying salaries as low as Rs 70 a day.In August this year, thousands of workers finally decided enough was enough and under the banner of Joint Forum of Trade Unions went on strike demanding a hike in their minimum wages.Currently, the prevailing daily wage is Rs 159, whereas the prescribed minimum wages for unskilled agricultural workers in West Bengal is fixed at Rs 244 while the MGNREGA wage is Rs 191 per day.Following a persistent protest, the state labour department on August 29 announced a hike in the minimum wage but the new amount is still unknown. Neighbouring Assam has already proposed a composite daily wage of Rs 351.33 and sought the opinion of tea planters so that it can be finalised.Seeking to get a similar deal in West Bengal, tea plantation workers under the banner of 'Joint Forum of Traders Union' have called for a nationwide strike on January 8 and 9 to voice their demands.Neither the Centre nor the state government is paying heeds to our demands. (The ruling) TMC alleges that the CPI(M) failed to do anything for us, but the present government is also not doing anything. The government is blatantly lying. We dont get ration under Centres flagship programme National rural health mission, which we used to get few months back, rued Mani Darnal, INTUC leader and general secretary of National Union of plantation workers.He says the beautiful landscapes of the hills have been guarding the secret of the state government well. Although Mamata Banerjee has been lauded for her Khadya Sathi (Food Partner) scheme (under which rice is sold at Rs 2 per kg), the starvation deaths in the hills highlight a different reality altogether.Between 2014 and 2015, over 150 starvation deaths were reported in the Dooars and despite the Tea Association refusing to comment on the subject, stray incidents of deaths often pop up from the Bengal hamlets.Ms Banerjee rubbished the reports of deaths and said, her government ensures supply of foodgrains to every single individual and there is not a single person in the state who does not get food. However, contrary to her claims, post demonetisation in 2016, workers in the tea gardens of Darjeeling have on many occasions been left to consume tea leaves in order to appease their hunger. Darjeeling, it must be underlined, alone has 38 registered tea gardens.Not only nutrition, but the tea workers are also deprived of basic amenities such as toilets and access to clean water. Under the Plantation Labour Act of 195, the workers are entitled to basic shelter. However, most of those working in gardens are homeless, shelterless or living on leased lands.Whatever development CM Banerjee has been talking about must have been on paper because, in reality, we dont see anything. Foreign export has tanked and the market rates have fallen drastically. Nobody wants to invest in this business. Only the two Tata and Godrej estates are making profit. There are no proper health or educational institutions, says Raju Nepali, social activist.A sliver of good news is the drop in child trafficking once rampant in the secluded parts of the Dooars. This has fallen since the introduction of state governments flagship programme Kanyashree, Raju added. Under the scheme, underprivileged school going girls are given a cycle to cut down their travel time."

5ce581fde8e3fc56af40ca9d,"Keep away blood pressure, diabetes the Yanomami way",https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/keep-away-blood-pressure-diabetes-the-yanomami-way/cid/1679249,2018-12-19,"Studies of adult Yanomamis since the 1980s have shown that atherosclerosis and obesity are virtually unknown among them iStockThe reason blood pressure tends to rise with age may be a Western diet and lifestyle, concludes a study of remote tribal communities that has been recently published in the journal, JAMA Cardiology.High blood pressure or hypertension is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In many countries, including India, the likelihood of developing high blood pressure increases with age.The study, led by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, US, found that the Yanomami people, an Amazonian tribe living in near-total isolation and with no Western dietary influences, showed no increase in average blood pressure from age one to age 60. In comparison, the Yekwanas, a nearby tribe whose diet includes some processed foods and salt, showed higher blood pressure in late middle age.The Yanomamis live as hunter-gatherers and gardeners in the rainforests of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela in South America. Their diet is low in fat and salt and high in fruits and fibre. Studies of adult Yanomamis since the 1980s have shown that atherosclerosis and obesity are virtually unknown among them. They have extraordinarily low blood pressure on average, with no apparent increase as they age.Dr Punyabrata Gun, a doctor involved with Shramajibi Swasthya Udyog  an organisation of doctors and health workers trying to reach healthcare to the poor and marginalised  has been associated with the treatment of tribals for several years. When I was in Chhattisgarh 30 years ago, the tribal people didnt suffer from any lifestyle disorder  high blood pressure, diabetes or cholesterol. Their diet was frugal yet more or less balanced, he recalls. In those days, there was little salt, sugar or oil in their cooked food. For protein, they depended on the fish found in plenty in streams and ponds. Wild fruits were abundant in the jungle. However, they didnt have access to enough rice or staples, Gun explains.For their study, the Johns Hopkins researchers took blood pressure measurements of 72 members of the Yanomami tribe aged between one and 60. They found that the blood pressure measurements averaged 95 (mm Hg) systolic over 63 diastolic. (In US adults, the average systolic is 122 and diastolic 71.) While this low figure is consistent with prior studies in Yanomami adults, the researchers measured roughly the same blood pressure among Yanomami children too. In fact, the data suggest that blood pressure in this population remains close to the same low level from age one through age 60, with no trend towards an increase or decrease.The Johns Hopkins study also reveals that this age-stability of blood pressure among the Yanomamis starts in early childhood. It is the first to compare the Yanomamis to the geographically co-located Yekwanas, who have been influenced by a Western diet and lifestyle. The researchers measured blood pressure in 83 members of the Yekwana tribe.That rising blood pressure is a result of ageing is a widely held belief in cardiology, but our findings add to evidence that rising blood pressure may be an avoidable consequence of a Western diet and lifestyle rather than ageing itself, says Noel Mueller, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Bloomberg School and member of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research.Dr Guns observations in the Indian tribal population reflect a somewhat similar pattern. He says, I no longer work with tribals in Chhattisgarh, but often visit tribal hamlets in the tea gardens of North Bengal. The dietary pattern here has a strong Western influence with more salt, sugar and oil. But they dont have enough protein and the diet is not balanced at all. There is malnutrition and a new type of diabetes  nutritional diabetes. This is accompanied by high blood pressure.In comparison among the Yekwanas, blood pressure readings at the youngest ages were virtually the same as those for their Yanomami peers but there was a statistically clear trend towards rising levels with advancing age  roughly 0.25mm Hg per year  such that the Yekwanas had levels averaging 5.8mm Hg higher by age 10, and 15.9mm Hg higher by age 50. This age-related rise in blood pressure begins in early childhood  which suggests that early childhood may be a window of opportunity for lifestyle interventions to prevent later rises in blood pressure, Mueller says.Mueller and his colleagues plan to follow up this study with one on the gut bacteria in Yanomamis and Yekwanas  to determine if the gut microbiome accounts for the two tribes differences in blood pressure with advancing age.The lesson here? Adhere to the Yanomami tribal diet as closely as possible to avoid hypertension and other lifestyle diseases."

5ce588bfe8e3fc56af40ce5a,Bad egg: Mid-day meals that only feed political goals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/bad-egg-mid-day-meals-that-only-feed-political-goals/cid/1679148,2018-12-18,"An egg a day keeps the doctor away. Eggs are among the most nutritious food items and contain almost all the nutrients required by growing children. This explains the long-standing demand to include them in mid-day meals, which is the primary  and, at times, the only  source of nutrition for close to 10 crore children. Given that India is home to a third of the worlds malnourished children, the importance of nutrient-rich items in the meal cannot be emphasized enough. Yet, time and again, religious and caste considerations of the majority  or should it be minority given that some estimates show only 23 per cent of Indians are actually vegetarian?  are allowed to come in the way of a childs health. It was recently revealed that an NGO contracted by the Centre to provide mid-day meals in 12 states kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for religious reasons. This is disturbing. But more worrying is that many state governments in a secular country have been influenced by similar concerns. The fundamental right to food also involves a right to choice, and surveys show that both parents and children in the states that do not serve eggs in mid-day meals are eager for its inclusion. What, then, explains the governments reservation against incorporating a non-vegetarian item? There are allegations that it is the result of pandering to influential caste groups and private contractors like the one in question. But such appeasement seems innocuous before more sinister influences of caste equations. Children from the scheduled groups  those who need it most  are reportedly given insufficient quantities of food, served last and asked to sit separately for mid-day meals.Yet, these biases are far from the only reasons behind the inadequacies of the scheme. Food procurement for mid-day meals is increasingly being centralized, wiping out traditional local diets  often more nutritious than the rice and pulses that are served  like various kinds of millets. Worse, the scheme is being used to replenish State coffers. For instance, in 2017 the ministry of human resource development directed that pulses for the scheme would come from the buffer stock of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation. In other words, help the Central body exhaust produce that it was unable to disburse. There are also directives to use fortified nutrients and packaged food on the pretext of making mid-day meals more hygienic. This opens the scheme up to private players. In the end, the scheme benefits a myriad stakeholders but one: children."

Nagar and T. Narsipur taluks.In 2017-18, 2.12 lakh tonnes was produced when the region was ravaged by drought and the government decided against releasing water from reservoirs for paddy cultivation in order to conserve water. But bountiful rains coupled with an expansion of area under paddy cultivation has helped both K.R. Nagar and T. Narsipur to register a leap in production this year. While K.R. Nagar has topped the district with 1,26,298 tonnes of paddy produced, T. Narsipur is close behind with 1,23,699 tonnes.While 26,100 hectares were brought under paddy production in K.R. Nagar, it was 25,563 hectares in T. Narsipur. Paddy production in other taluks was also high, with Nanjangud producing 79,604 tonnes, Mysuru producing 30,592 tonnes, Hunsur 48,342 tonnes, H.D. Kote 33,631 tonnes, and Periyapatna 40,914 tonnes, according to P. Shivanna, joint director of the Department of Food, Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs.In the meantime, the district administration has established paddy procurement centres, for which registration and enrolment will take place at 12 places, including the APMC yards in taluk centres, said Mr. Shivanna. Farmers should register themselves by producing the documents stipulated by the government. The APMC yards will also assess the quality of the paddy produced, after which it will be directly procured by rice mills. The farmers will have to bear the transportation charges.Mr. Shivanna told reporters recently that consequent to farmers and their produce meeting the stipulated standards, the rice mills will directly procure paddy and the payment would be transferred to the bank accounts of ryots. The government has announced a procurement price of Rs. 1,750 a quintal; it will be Rs. 1,770 for Grade A paddy. Consequent to the announcement of procurement price, the open market rates for paddy also registered a surge, Mr. Shivanna said.The procurement process will commence in the third week of December and end on March 31, 2019. The enrolment process began on December 5. The authorities have warned against the intervention of middlemen and brokers at procurement centres, saying that criminal cases would be registered against them if found in the vicinity.Govt. policy flayed.However, the government policy on paddy procurement has drawn flak from farmers organisations.Kurubur Shanthakumar of the Federation of Indian Farmers Associations said the limitation of procuring only 40 quintals from each farmer has to be lifted. He said that for two years, the region experienced drought and production had taken a hit, but this year, there has bee good harvest thanks to bountiful rains. The government is now set to neutralise the gains the farmers have made, he claimed.Likewise, direct procurement by rice mills has been criticised as farmers have to bear the produce transportation charges."

In a year, farmer-shareholder count has risen to 41, with a share capital of Rs. 8 lakh. The collective has been engaged not only in conserving and propagating traditional rice varieties by following organic methods of cultivation, but also in procuring them from its members at a premium and selling the end product at an affordable price, after making some value additions.Focus on fair priceThe company was constituted last year as an agri start-up to ensure fair price for the produce of farmers who are doing ecological farming, besides ensuring consumers get safe food at an affordable cost. In the process, [we] generate rural employment, says Rajesh Krishnan, the CEO of the company, who is also a farmer.The firms main focus is to revive traditional paddy varieties of Wayanad, which include aromatic rice varieties such as Gandhakasala and Mullan kaima, and others including Thondi, Paal Thondi and Chennellu , says chairman O.V. Johnson. Chennellu and Mullankaima are known for their nutritional and medicinal properties, he added.While the government procures paddy at a minimum support price of Rs. 25.30 a kg, the company offers Rs. 30 for traditional rice varieties and Rs. 50 a kg for aromatic varieties. These are sold in the market from Rs. 70 to Rs. 110 a kg, and the profit is given to members as incentives.Aiming to promote the Mullan Kaima variety, the company has expanded cultivation on 8 acres of land this season. In FY18, it procured 35 tonnes of organically-grown traditional varieties of paddy. This year, procurement is projected at about 100 tonnes from around 65 farmers, including two self-help groups."

Kaipad rice tracts spread in about 3,100 hectares in Kannur, Kozhikode and Kasaragod districts will be the area of jurisdiction of the agency.It will function as the apex body of Malabar Kaipad Farmers Society (MKFS), which was formed in 2010. Kattampally Nelkrishi Vikasana Agency, which was formed only for Kattampally Kaipad, will merge in KADS.The formation KADS is the outcome of the efforts to sustain and protect organic Kaipad rice tracts in the region as part of the research activities initiated by the Kerala Agricultural Universitys Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Pilicode in Kasaragod.The formation of KADS is the latest landmark achievement of the sustained research and development activities carried as part of our research, said Vanaja T., professor at RARS and principal investigator and breeder of the Kaipad rice variety development project. The research programme launched in 2000 led to the release of four saline-tolerant high-yielding organic varieties, she said adding that the idea of a new agency for Kaipad farming was formulated following a State-level workshop for coastal rice farmers in 2014.Kattampally Nelkrishi Vikasana Agency, which was formed only for Kattampally Kaipad in this district, will merge in KADS.Governing bodyThe new agency has a governing body with the Agriculture Minister as chairman.The 40-member body includes MPs and MLAs of constituencies having kaipad tracts in the region, district panchayat presidents and Collectors of the three districts, representatives of related departments and the MKFS.The 16-member executive committee has the Collector of Kannur as chairman, Collectors of Kasaragod and Kozhikode as vice chairmen and Principal Agriculture Officer of Kannur as convener.It also has four regional level advisory committees representing Traditional Kaipad and Kattampally Kaipad of Kannur district, Kaipad tract of Kozhikode and Kasaragod districts."

Several districts of West Bengal were flooded. Walking through one such limpid countryside along the banks of the Kulik river in North Dinajpur, Das, a Geography teacher, was surprised to see some paddy crops still standing erect, undamaged.That left Das and his two friends  Sudipta Mukherjee, an officer with the fire services department in Calcutta, and Rupak Kumar Paul, a college teacher  intrigued. Das says, That is the first time we learnt about paddy that is flood-resistant. Thereafter, the three decided to follow up the revelation with some serious research. In due course, they came to know about paddy varieties that are drought-resistant and others that can grow in brackish water.They also learnt that these indigenous or folk varieties with names such as Kalli, Changa, Kochi, Malsera, Kakri, Bahurupi had ceded place to high-yielding hybrid rice, a hot market favourite. Five years later, Das and his friends launched the Forum for Indigenous Agricultural Movement or Fiam, a platform to rejuvenate lost varieties of rice.The first step was finding as many varieties of seeds as possible. One stop was the Agriculture Training Centre at Phulia; it had over 400 varieties of heirloom seeds. The other thing to do was identify individuals with collections.Abhra Chakraborty of Guskara in Burdwan is such a person. Chakraborty works in the state fisheries department but paddy is his passion. He has preserved nearly 440 varieties. He has also cultivated some and taken more land on lease recently to plant the rest.Abhra talks about how seed conservation is a tricky science and has to be done with some art. It needs a lot of knowledge and involvement. I divide my plot into several parts, keeping in mind the time of pollination of each variety. He explains that self pollination does happen but it is not desirable as it compromises the genetic purity of a particular variety.Das has also converted a portion of the 24 bighas of land owned by him for conservation. He has planted a variety of paddy seeds. The thrust of his initiative, Fiam, is to produce more rice of the available variety so that there is enough seed for mass production.He distributes these seeds among farmers, simultaneously educating them about the virtues of indigenous crop. We managed to cultivate 50 bighas of land in 2014; 200 farmers were involved, he says.Ten years on, Fiam has many more stakeholders. Says Das, It is a mixed group. There are those who have degrees in Computer Science, there are English Literature graduates. Many of them have chosen not to leave their native village for urban opportunities. Instead, they have taken up farming and the cause of folk rice.Fresh graduate Tanmay Das of Raiganj district is one of them. He tells The Telegraph, It is a misconception that hybrid varieties give better yield. There are high yielding folk varieties too. Also, hybrids require a lot of chemical fertilisers; this is bad for soil health. Salim Naskar is also a graduate farmer from South Dinajpur. He says, I have come to know about organic farming. I can easily integrate my knowledge about modern farming techniques with the legacy knowledge handed down to me by my forefathers.The vice-president of Fiam is Dr Sudeb Saha, a practicing doctor. It has been 30 years since hybrids took over the market. There is a resurgence of folk varieties no doubt, but it will be some time before they can even begin to catch up, he says."

There were many at the temple waiting to have the prasada and were fortunate, said Nagaraju, a native of Hanur, who lives in Mysuru.A majority of the victims were women and children, and locals accompanying them. They were from Bidarahalli, Marthahalli, Voddaradoddi, M.G. Doddi and Sulwadi villages, and worked in local granite quarries or as daily wagers. The temple is also frequented by devotees from neighbouring Tamil Nadu. The number of devotees was more on Friday as there was a guddali puja to the temple gopura.I saw the devotees dancing soon after eating the rice baath served at 10.30 a.m. Within 10 minutes, they started collapsing one after the other, complaining of stomach pain and dizziness. Soon, most of the devotees started experiencing breathlessness, said an eyewitness, Susheela, who had gone to the temple with her mother. Susheela, a student at Maharanis College in Mysuru and a native of Bidarahalli, said she told the devotees not to eat the prasada because of some strange smell coming from it.One of the relatives attending to an ailing man at K.R. Hospital in Mysuru said it took time to shift patients because of the location. The village was close to the forest border and the people faced communication problems, said the relative, who works in Mysuru.The devotees who took ill were immediately rushed to the local primary health centre for first aid, but the doctor and the paramedical staff at the PHC, suspecting that their condition was grave, immediately shifted them to different hospitals, including K.R. Hospital in Mysuru, Government Hospital at Kollegal, and a few private medical institutions at Kamagere and Ramapura.The doctors and the nurses were at their wits end to handle the sudden rush of cases and the more serious ones were shifted to K.R. Hospital in Mysuru where 32 patients were wheeled in. Of them, 10 were in an unconscious state. They were immediately put on life support system, while five others were shifted to JSS Hospital where ventilator support was available.Doctors at the K.R. Hospital said all the symptoms are pointers to poisoning as patients were suffering from muscular pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting, besides breathlessness.Senior officials of both Chamarajanagar and Mysuru district administration are coordinating and supervising the relief operations. Some unconfirmed reports coming in said the carcass of some birds had been found at Sulwadi and were suspected to have consumed discarded prasada.CM rushes to MysuruChief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who rushed to Mysuru on Friday night, said that initially it was presumed to be a minor incident and neither the government nor the district administration knew about the gravity of the situation. Expressing deep sorrow over the tragedy, he said he has ordered a probe and two people have already been taken into custody."

They are mostly built by the family members themselves, sometimes, with a helping hand from neighbour of the same tribe in erecting poles and laying the roof.Eega Ramanammas house is a model, meeting all the features of the mud-walled house - with three rooms including a hall, bedroom under one thatched roof. It has a separate fireplace made of mud and a kitchen meant both for cooking and storing grains and water.The motifs of various floral designs and birds are drawn on the floor with rice powder. They use chalk powder to draw the motifs on the walls.The life of the roof laid using grass procured from the river is at least five years while mud-walls sustain the same period. Cow dung is applied on the walls occasionally to maintain the smoothness, Ms. Ramanamma told The Hindu , daughter of a crab hunter."

She said that it develops due to bad nutrition.Dr Kotchea was speaking at the 8th World Ayurveda Congress organized in the city. The four-day event, taking place in the city for the first time, will conclude on December 17.Majority of the diseases occur due to our deviation from normal practices of living, eating and exercise, she said. Compared to allopathy, Ayurveda looks at diabetes with a different perspective  we never ask the patient to stop consuming ghee or oil as it increases vaat prakriti, causing further problems. We also advise two meals and nothing in between. The meal has to be taken at 9-10 am in the morning and around 7.30 pm in the evening. The person can take fruits or juice.She suggested Trikonasana, Chakrasana and Dhanurasana in asana and practice of Bhramari and Kalapbhati pranayam.One should not have chapati, rice and potato together. If you are eating one, avoid the other two for the day. We also suggest use of coarse grains such as pearl millet, corn, jowar, etc. in making of chapatis, she said. One should keep changing the grains for the maximum health benefit.Dr Gurudatta Amin, a diabetes expert from a Mumbai, said that they have devised a concept of diet kit and the patients are advised to reduce their food intake at 800 calories daily.Along with techniques like Panchkarma, diet control seems to have the best effect on the diabetes patients , he said. In many cases, we also see the reversal. The patients have to follow the regime. More and more India-based Ayurvedic facilities are conducting scientific research in the field with increased interest from foreign scholars who look at the method as complementing conventional remedies."

A camera focusing on the kitchen, where the tomato bath that was served as prasadam to the devotees was prepared, is also dysfunctional, much to the cops chagrin.Police pointed out that the temple premises are mostly uninhabited in the evening, and as evidence of the tragedy having been an act of sabotage mounts, cops said that miscreants may have been up to some mischief at that time. Had this been a case of just food poisoning, we would not have seen the effects as immediately, nor would they have been so severe. In this case, reaction to the prasadam was immediate. All those who had the tomato bath were seen writhing in pain near the kitchen, a police official said.Shankar, one of the priests at the temple, said that nearly 15kg of rice was used to prepare the tomato bath, which was to be distributed among them and the devotees. It was for a special occasion since the foundation stone was laid to build the temples gopuram . But, some devotees arrived early, and we served them food, deciding to eat the same at a later time. But fate had something else planned, said Shankar.Chamarajanagar superintendent of police Dharmendra Kumar Meena told STOI that a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder had been registered against thus far unknown miscreants. We have launched a probe, Meena said.Kollegal deputy superintendent of police Puttamadaiah, who is heading three investigation teams constituted to probe the incident, said that they were quizzing many people, and that it was too early to state anything conclusively since cops were awaiting reports."
5ce59f0ee8e3fc56af40d94b,Laid bare: the limitations of identity politics,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/laid-bare-the-limitations-of-identity-politics/cid/1678818,2018-12-15,"By ascribing its debacle in five states to tactical and technical reasons, Bharatiya Janata Party propagandists and apologists are trying to shift attention from the substance of the partys appeal to its style of presentation. The tactic also implies that some kind of sleight of hand like Rahul Gandhis digital internal feedback system enabled the Congress to secure Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The achievement of the two regional parties in Telangana and Mizoram can then be written off as exploiting local sentiment.Watching live coverage of the British House of Commons in recent weeks, I was struck by both the contrast and similarity with our legislatures. The contrast is that British parliamentarians are genuinely debating a matter of vital importance (Brexit) with passion but politeness, obeying the authority of a Speaker who does not hesitate to reprimand even the prime minister. Points are made without any trace of the personal vitriol that disfigured Indias election campaign. The similarity is that both countries are saddled with prime ministers who place career above other considerations and exude an air of insufferable smugness. While the Commons has given Theresa May a 12-month reprieve, Indian voters have reminded Narendra Modi that even heady populism makes little impact on empty stomachs. Modi has till March to ponder on how to cope with disappointment at the gulf between his governments promise and performance.Beyond the cow belt, Telangana and Mizoram highlighted both the competitive nature of the identity politics that is the BJPs stock in trade and its limitations. The Telangana Rashtra Samithis sweep of 88 seats did not include the former Speaker and four cabinet ministers whom voters refused to endorse this time. Either their performance left something to be desired or their Congress opponents were more persuasive. Either way, the outcome demonstrated it isnt enough to be a Telugu. By that token, the BJPs dwindling representation  down from five to a solitary legislator with even the president and former president of the partys state unit losing their seats  suggests it isnt enough to flaunt saffron either.The chief minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, and his son, K.T. Rama Rao, winner of the Most Inspirational Icon of the Year 2015 by CNN-IBN and Ritz Magazine, have at different times touched on what really matters in any leadership contest in a society where poverty goes hand in hand with strong sectarian loyalties. The chief minister, who famously broadcasts his freedom from bigotry with the slogan I am the best Hindu. I am the best Muslim. And I am also the biggest Communist, lives up to the boast by maintaining friendly relations with the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief, Asaduddin Owaisi. His son hit the nail on the head after the results were announced, saying, Irrigation has to be a huge priority because we have given the people of Telangana a categorical commitment that we will ensure one crore acres of land will be irrigated. Whether he will keep his word is another matter. But the election results confirm that Indian voters give short shrift to politicians who talk big and deliver little.The message from tiny Mizoram tucked away in the northeastern hills, where also a local party swept the board, capturing 26 out of 40 seats, and whose 84-year-old chief minister categorically repudiated the BJPs ideology, is no less relevant to the periodic tests of popularity inherent in the democratic process. Some years ago, European Union delegates at an Oxford seminar on the linkage between politics and territory wondered at Mizorams inclusion in India, and New Delhis management of such a remote territory. The historical explanation that Mizoram is Indian because the British included the Lushai Hills (as the region was called) in pre-Independence Assam was not to the liking of political delegates from India who rambled about Asokas extensive empire. Its easier, therefore, and also more pertinent, to explain how India almost lost Mizoram through economic neglect when the bamboo flowered (as Mizos say) in 1959. That produced a boom in the rodent population which wolfed down bamboos and bamboo seeds, then turned to crops, and infested huts and houses. The havoc was terrible and very little grain was harvested. Mizos who didnt die of starvation survived on roots and leaves from the jungle.Mizos called the famine Mautam, and in March 1960 the Mizo leader, Laldenga, changed the name of their front organization, the Mizo Cultural Society, to Mautam Front. It evolved into the Mizo National Famine Front which, as the Mizo National Front, mobilized young Mizos to collect rice and other essential commodities for the deprived and suffering interior. The MNF wanted economic relief to start with but then demanded political independence and waged a secessionist war for 20 years until Rajiv Gandhi persuaded the guerrilla fighters to lay down arms, renounce secession and sign the Mizo Accord in 1986. The MNF won that years election and formed a government with Laldenga as chief minister. Zoramthanga took over after he died, heading the government from 1998 to 2008.The aged former rebel leader who was twice chief minister has now returned to the chair a third time while the Congress, which ruled Mizoram for a decade, has been reduced to five constituencies. Apart from the anti-incumbency factor, explanations include Central indifference to Mizo problems, mismanagement allegations, and the suspicion that all national parties impinge on regional rights, reinforced by the Congress abolition three years ago of prohibition which is almost an article of faith in an evangelical society. Religion also militates against the BJP which did win a seat but in a non-tribal area. Zoramthangas comment, Mizoram is a Christian state and we are a compact society so there is no space for BJP ideology, warned that Mizoram is jealously determined to guard a cultural identity that is quite as unique as that of the reclusive Sentinelese islanders. Thenphunga Sailo, a former Indian army brigadier and chief minister from 1978 to 1984, persistently highlighted another aspect of the conflict of identities by exposing military atrocities against civilians. As in Nagaland, MNF fighters are viewed not as traitors but patriots who might be misguided.The three mainline states the Congress has wrested from the BJP highlight fundamental complaints about the problems created by demonetization washing away 86 per cent of the currency in circulation, a probably well intentioned but poorly administered goods and services tax, farmers indebtedness and poor support prices for cereals, oilseeds and milk, rising unemployment, and welfare schemes that have become instruments of political patronage. The low-level corruption that continues to flourish is far more irksome for ordinary people than the alleged cupidity of the glamorous, flashy playboy that Vijay Mallya is said to be or the supposed international wheeling and dealing of a British subject like Christian Michel whom the Indian government is suspected of having traded for the Sheikh of Dubais runaway daughter. These are national distortions like trying to grab the Reserve Banks savings to fund politically-inspired projects or the determination to misuse the Central Bureau of Investigation. They are part of the great betrayal. Just as Swachh Bharat has not made India any cleaner, Make in India has not boosted domestic manufacture.But Telangana and Mizoram are significant. They are a reminder that although 79.8 per cent of the population is listed as Hindu, any audit of all the different communities that treasure their distinctive group identities at once reveals India as a nation of minorities. They cannot be welded together into a strong national whole by constantly trying to fan anger against waves of Muslim invasion and conquest many centuries ago. These election results show that while some resentment might still linger it is not powerful enough to distract attention from the BJPs administrative failures."

Curtains can be made from tarpaulin, bamboo, dry grass, paddy straw, guinea bags and jute. Shady trees around the shed should be trimmed to encourage the infiltration of sunlight in the shed which will not only provide warmth but will also disinfect the animal houses due to action of ultraviolet rays.He suggested animals should be taken under direct sun during daytime. Animals shed and its floor should not remain wet and cool for longer periods of time. This may expose the animals, especially younger ones, to various ailments like pneumonia, fever, coccidiosis, diarrhoea and even death in severe cases, Dr Malik added.Dr Malik suggested that suitable bedding up to the depth of 4-6 inches in large animals and 2 inches for smaller animals should be provided on puccaa (concrete) floor as direct contact of animal with cold floor will leads to more body heat loss through conduction.Paddy straw, dry grass, wheat bhusa, saw dust, rice husk could be used as bedding material. Jhuls (clothing) made up of gunny bags may also be used on larger animals to provide them insulation and warmth during extreme winter season, he said.Good ventilation must be ensured during winters. Shed should be cleaned at least twice in a day for proper disposal of wastes and minimum piling up of ammonia gases.Animals should be cleaned regularly with clean cloth or some brush. Hairs of animals should not be clipped during winters. Bathing of animals with cold water during winter should be avoided.Animals should be provided with good nutritious and balanced diet during winters. Berseem, most abundantly available green fodder, has high protein percentage and water content, can easily support production level of lactating and growing animals. So, accordingly protein containing ingredients i.e. cakes in concentrates shall be reduced for economical production.He advised that one should never forget to incorporate 2% mineral mixture and 1% salt in concentrate feed during winters. It should be purchased from reputed manufacturers. Clean, fresh, lukewarm water should be offered to the animals during winters.De-worming should be repeated 21 days after the initial dose to prevent other worm eggs and larvae in their additional stages of development. One should use suitable acaricides in the shed and on animals to control this problem, he added."

Although TDP president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has campaigned in many constituencies in the city, the partys focus was on Kukatpally with AP Minister Paritala Sunitha and several other leaders camped in the constituency till completion of electioneering.Apart from seeking the support of beneficiaries of welfare schemes such as social security pensions, Kalyana Lakshmi/Shaadi Mubarak and others, the TRS poll managers have adopted a strategy particularly to woo the communities that are traditionally opposed to the ruling community in AP.Accordingly, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Raos son K.T. Rama Rao directly contacted whos who of the two communities by organising meetings in the name of Hamara Hyderabad, where he successfully drove home the point that Mr. Naidu was trying to divide the Seemandhra society settled in Hyderabad.Mr. Naidus efforts to polarise the electorate by making allegations against TRS that the latter had terrorised Seemandhra settlers during the GHMC elections to win 99 out of 150 divisions was also not well-received by the settlers. The TRS leadership on the other hand, repeatedly appealed to settlers not to fall into the trap of Mr. Naidu and they were as much Hyderabadis as others settled in the city from other parts of Telangana and neighbouring States.The TRS leadership also explained to the electorate as to how the government did not discriminate in extending the welfare schemes on basis of nativity/region.Beneficiaries of schemesWe have supported (voted) TRS as our family has been getting welfare schemes such as sufficient rice on ration cards and old-age pensions, Shamshad Begum, working as a maid in Kukatpally area said when asked why they had supported TRS.The YSR Congress and Jana Sena Party, which are identified with two influential communities in Seemandhra regions, have also extended support to the TRS indirectly to ensure big win for the TRS candidates.We are fed up with the domination of the ruling community across AP and accordingly, our community leaders have decided to support TRS to teach a lesson to the TDP in Telangana for now.The message to support TRS was spread through social media tools such as Whatsapp effectively, K. Veera Reddy, a native of Tadipatri area settled in Hyderabad for over 25 years now said, explaining how they supported TRS in this election."

FCI authorities fear that if the strike is drawn out longer, millers and the central procurement agency could face problems.Millers started delivering rice on November 22. More than 170 lakh metric tonnes of paddy has been procured in Punjab and is stacked in rice mills. After every 100 kilograms, millers return 67% rice to the FCI after custom milling of paddy.Rice millers in Punjab say they are finding it difficult to deliver rice in the central pool after custom milling because of the strike. Cold weather and space constraint are also making storage difficult, they said.FCI workers association member Anand Kumar said, employees have been raising the demand for wage revision for a long time but no one paid heed. We started work to rule from November 8, meaning working up to 5pm. On December 10, we went on a complete strike. If our demands are not met, we will intensify the protest and make all operations come to a standstill.Association member Satish Kumar said if the strike continues, millers may have to face financial losses as rice would have to be stored in moist conditions after custom milling, which could lessen its weight. We want FCI management to make alternative arrangements for movement of rice from mills, he said.Manager, procurement, Bathinda Siddarth Chakkerpani said millers approached them for making alternative arrangements, but they are helpless."

What followed was a medley of comments ranging memes to trolls. The main point of criticism was that the vegetables looked too raw and remotely resembled a decent avial.Some commented that it was good that they mentioned avial or else they would have mistook it for a salad. Malayalam writer N S Madhavan wrote ""Any family court in Kerala will grant you an easy divorce - and hefty alimony - if your spouse actually made you this aviyal""If this is Aviyal, I just grew a peacock tail and a second head, tweeted writer Anitha Nair.Taking the criticisms in right spirit, the Kerala Tourism handle came with a comment hours later after the first ' Avial ' tweet.

And some are former students of the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, who have made it to the festival despite the scaled down nature of the event.One such enthusiast is Nadi Palshikar from Pune, who has been coming to the festival since 2005 when she was selected for a filmmaking contest held alongside that years film festival.Reaching outThe Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) alumnus is a medical doctor, who makes use of films to reach out to women from the less affluent sections.I did a film appreciation course from the National Film Archives in Pune in 1999. It was then I felt I could use films to sensitise women on issues that otherwise would take a planned project to implement, she says.Nadi later did a course in script writing with the FTII to get to know the making of films. But instead of writing a script, I ended up writing a novel, Sutar.Films have always fascinated her and the IFFK is a festival she holds dear for the common man link it has. Any day, she would choose to come to Kerala for the stock of good films shown here, for the people with whom she feels a camaraderie and for the brown rice and avial she enjoys.The IFFK has sure been scaled down but we did not come for the grand functions but for the films, she says.According to her, there are many among the FTII alumni who would choose the IFFK over the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) for the choice of films and as a festival where the red carpet remains subdued in comparison to the content.Rebuilding processAnother FTII alumnus and freelancer script writer Samvartha Sahil is here both for the love of films and also to be able to contribute to the rebuilding process after floods.I wanted to go for the IFFI but was caught up in a documentary work in Kolkata.

I am happy to be able to contribute for flood relief as an IFFK delegate, he says.The FTII students are mostly encouraged to attend the IFFI in Goa due to the proximity of the place to Pune, but there are some who choose to come here for the quality of films shown.Rachitha Gorowala had come here in 2012 when she was still a student at the FTII.Now, a documentary filmmaker in Bhopal, she makes movies for the government and has recently finished one on Bhopal for the Films Division titled Begamon ka Bhopal .Political undertoneI also attended the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala (IDSFFK) but found the movies selected have a political undertone. This baffles me, as movies can also be about the poetry and drama that life offers, she says.She loves the festival for its treatment of cinema and for the city which according to her is as laidback as her hometown yet has people patient enough to wait and watch good movies."

The ruling dispensation had earlier announced its decision to ban single use plastic products across the state from January 1, 2019.Retailers have started to stock up alternatives for plastic bags - molasses containers, and bags made of cloth, biodegradable materials, paper and more.We have put up notices asking customers to bring cloth bags. We also remind them about the plastic ban from January at the cash counters. We are still thinking about an alternative to pack liquid items in our food court, said Dharmar C, manager, Shri Kannan Departmental Store at Ganapathy.Karthick P, manager of LongLive Pizza shop at Saravanampatti, said they have ordered for food containers made of molasses. He said they would also use paper boxes with handles, instead of plastic covers.A rice shop owner in Saibaba Colony said he has found an alternative in non woven carry bags. If customers buy 5kg-10kg rice, we will pack them in cloth bags. For smaller quantities, we will just use newspaper bundles as old days, he said.Restaurant owners have, on their part, decided to use cloth bags, newspaper and banana leaf. They are, however, yet to find a solution for packing liquid items.If we use containers to pack sambhar or rasam, the cost would be higher. Neither can we take the burden of packing expenses nor leave it on customers. We hope to come up with a solution soon, said Vivek Srinivasan, executive director of Sree Annapoorna Gowrishankar group on Mettupalayam Road.Another hotelier, Mukesh T, said he would ask customers to bring tiffin boxes. Another option for him is banana leaves.Textile shop owners said they have already started switching to cloth bags. We had placed orders for cloth bags as soon as the government announced the order. Our customers wont feel comfortable carrying bags and hence we give them cloth and jute bags, said Amulraj A, manager, Chennai Silks on cross cut road.Compostable bag manufacturers are, meanwhile, gearing up to face the demand for alternative bags. We make compostable bags using tapioca starch and waste vegetable starch that would compose within 115 days, said R Soundharya of Ecofora.The city corporation is likely to penalise the violators. An official said corporation commissioner had taken steps to create awareness on the need to avoid use and throw plastic items. Strangest action should be taken against the violators, he said."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.NEW DELHI: When the poll results came in on Tuesday, one thing was clear: BJP had taken a hit in rural areas. And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

Rangarajan has emphasised the need for sustained economic growth in Tamil Nadu even as the State implements various welfare schemes.During a discussion on the book, The Dravidian Years: Politics and Welfare in Tamil Nadu, authored by retired IAS officer S. Narayan, at the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS), Mr. Rangarajan cautioned against distributing freebies without focus and a targeted approach.Mr. Rangarajan, also the Chairman of the Madras School of Economics, said: Welfare is important, but to what extent can it go? Some lines have to be drawn!While stating that the distribution of bicycles to girl students and mixies to rural women were understandable, he reserved his views on the distribution of TV sets.Defending his analysis, Mr. Narayan questioned why the distribution of freebies cannot be equated to asset transfer, like in Kerala, where land is acquired and redistributed to the poor. He also compared governance and the social equalisation that took place under three Chief Ministers - M. Karunanidhi, M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa.Historical perspectiveProfessor Reetika Khera of the Indian Institute of Management  Ahmedabad pointed out that there was a need to unpack the political will during the initial years of Dravidian party rule to understand how peoples welfare schemes were implemented on the ground. She contended that freebies, as small interventions, had put pressure on private players catering to the needs of the poor.Referring to the baby kits being distributed by the Tamil Nadu government, she said a study of such kits in Scandinavian countries showed that young mothers preferred them over cash.Reducing dependenceJ. Jeyaranjan, Director of the Institute of Development Alternatives, observed that freebies helped reduce the dependence of the poor on the landed. With free rice over the years, the poor became less dependent on the landlords, and thus, [such freebies] ensured social justice, he said.Professor M. Vijayabaskar of MIDS pointed out that the Central government followed the Tamil Nadu government in implementing the noon-meal scheme.Assistant Professor A. Kalaiyarasan said that the capacity of the people in Tamil Nadu to aspire for more was among the major reasons for the successful implementation of both State and Central government schemes.MIDS Director Shashank Bhide was also present at the occasion.Welfare is important, but to what extent can it go?

The Lebanese photography, Fouad Elkoury, has a series of images called Civil War: Volumes 1 to 4. Elkoury used to walk through Beirut carrying two cameras around his neck, one loaded with black-and-white film and the other with colour film. He would take two consecutive photographs  two distinct points in time, separated only by the time it took to put down one camera and focus the other. Sometimes the passage of time is imperceptible and sometimes it is dramatic  the world seems suddenly transformed. When I first saw this series, I felt a great admiration for it. I think Im interested in those distinct points in time that we begin to see as one unfolding moment; we catch something in mid-motion. I think thats what I was trying to do in both those books, Do Not Say We Have Nothing and Dogs at the Perimeter. The moment by moment before catastrophe, and the moment by moment afterward. I think both books are about revolution, about idealism crippled by violence, and how we live or try to live as the worlds we know are collapsing and changing.Q:A: Perhaps the loneliness. Sometimes people come alone, or are cut off from family and friends, routines, rituals, possessions. I think, with my parents, immigration was both liberating and emptying. They came to some essentialness about themselves but it was also disorienting because they were also being re-created in a new place. Not all migrants have this melancholy of course, but maybe it occurs when one feels that a decisive and irreversible rupture with the past has occurred. And also it comes and goes, or disappears for decades only to reappear later, long after another life has been lived. Eventually people arent exactly missing a physical place, but a time.Q:A: Even now, twenty years after writing this story, it still holds something mysterious to me. Perhaps food has this presence in immigrant lives becomes it becomes so freighted with other meanings  parental love, protection, memory, tradition, reinvention (not all tastes or dishes can be re-created elsewhere), skill or expertise. Plus, will the gift or the offering be accepted by a child? Can they reject this food without rejecting the care that went into making it? From personal experience, I would say the answer is no. When my father was in the kitchen cooking  he cooks beautiful Hakka cuisine  he was at his most relaxed, confident and at peace. I loved watching him cook. It was a glimpse into other things that might have been.Q:A: I've never been to Mumbai before, and never to India, and I feel so happy that I finally have the chance to visit. The two writers that spring to mind are both Canadian, born in Mumbai.

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.HUBBALLI: Is jowar, a staple food of North Karnataka , slowly disappearing from their diet? If you go by experts views and agriculture department data, this could well be the case.Due to continued drought and farmers eyeing commercial crops, cultivation of jowar (sorghum) is shrinking year by year. In the past 10 years, the cultivation has reduced to almost half. According to the agriculture department, in 2006-07, the crop was grown on 14.19 lakh hectares across the state, but in 2016-17, it was just 9.46 lakh hectares. In 2018-19, it further reduced to 7.5 lakh hectares.The major reasons for fall in cultivation area are incessant drought, labour intensive, low productivity and high input cost. Though the produce has a good price in the market, farmers get less after deducting all expenses.Experts attribute low consumption of jowar to the state governments Anna Bhagya scheme. They say it has changed the food culture of the region.Agricultural expert R V Patil Suresh Gowda said under the scheme, the government is distributing rice and people have started to use it extensively. The government should have reduced the quantity of rice and distributed more jowar under the Public Distribution System He added that farmers have started using machines on their farms instead of cattle. They used to grow jowar at least to provide fodder for cattle. Now, farmers are growing jowar just for their consumption. It needs less water compared to other crops, but the problem is that farmers are not encouraged to grow it, he said.Dr Sanjeev Kulkarni, a gynaecologist-turned-farmer, said as irrigation is increasing, farmers are eyeing commercial crops such as sugarcane and pomegranate and therefore the area used for cultivating jowar is decreasing. Moreover, people are consuming more instant food. The new generation doesnt know how to bake jolad rotti (jowar bread).Making jolada rotti is a laborious job. The new generation finds it difficult to bake rottis and children prefer rice and chappati instead. Parents pack their wards lunch boxes with rice or chappati items. The tradition of jowar rotti for breakfast is also fading, Dr Kulkarni said.Ningappa Kurbar, a farmer from Annigeri, said he had sown sorghum in 3 acres last year, but the yield was just 3 quintals which he kept for domestic use. ""Usually, the yield used to be around 6-7 quintals per acre if it rained well, but for the past few years, I havent sold a single kilogram of jowar in the market,"" he said."

Godavari may miss March 31 deadline for canal closure,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/e-godavari-may-miss-march-31-deadline-for-canal-closure/article25715359.ece,2018-12-11,"Agriculture officials in East Godavari district are caught in a Catch-22 situation this Rabi season.Officials want sowing operations to be finished by March 31 so that all canals in the district can be closed for modernisation work, but farmers are unwilling to opt for short-duration paddy varieties as they do not offer the same yield as long-duration ones do.Paddy is sown in an extent of 4.36 lakh acres in the district during the Rabi season that usually starts on December 1 and ends by March.If the canals are closed by March 31, irrigation officials can undertake comprehensive modernisation works from April 1 and complete them before water is released into the canals from the Godavari river for the next Kharif season from June 1.However, the long-duration paddy varieties take about 135 days to yield, making the March 31 deadline tough to meet.If farmers continue to go for the long-duration variety, officials will have to defer closure of the canals to April-end. The irrigation department will then be unable to undertake modernisation works on a large scale.Selection of the seed variety will be crucial, as the closure of canals will directly impact varieties with longer crop duration.Bondalu a safe betThis year, we have come up with the MTU rice varieties, which have a duration of 120 days. Despite publicising the varieties, not many farmers are evincing interest. Instead, they prefer to go for the traditional Bondalu (MTU-3626) variety that has a 135-day crop duration, said K.S.V. Prasad, Joint Director of Agriculture.Though the farmers are following the advice of the officials to opt for the direct sowing method, they are keen on opting for the Bondalu variety for the simple reason that it gives high yield.Swarna variety is a safe bet for us during Kharif, as it can sustain cyclones. But the yield is hardly 35 bags per acre. During Rabi, we can expect a yield of 55-60 bags per acre by sowing the Bondalu variety, said Sathi Venkata Reddy, a paddy farmer from Rayavaram.Transplantation is getting delayed by a fortnight in the eastern and central deltas, which will delay the canal closure. We are trying our best to convince farmers, as the canal repairs and maintenance works too are equally important, said Mr. Prasad."

Singh Deo. Rahul Gandhi will now pick the head of the government, keeping the 2019 parliamentary elections in mind.While Baghel is a four-term MLA and was a minister in the Digvijaya Singh government of Madhya Pradesh, Singh Deo, the current leader of Opposition in Chhattisgarh, comes from the Sarguja royal family.Mahant, a three-time Lok Sabha MP, was also a minister in the Digvijaya cabinet as well as being a central minister in the Manmohan Singh government. Mahant was the state Congress president in the 2013 elections.The Congress, which lost its entire frontline leadership in Chhattisgarh in the worst-ever Maoist attack in 2013, came tantalisingly close to victory in the last election but a wafer-thin margin of 0.7 per cent votes handed a third term to Raman Singh who had become a colossus in the state by distributing cheap rice among the poor.The chawal wale baba, as Singh is known, faced an entirely new narrative in this election as the Congress succeeded in turning the tables on him over the same rice.Congress president Rahul Gandhi led an aggressive campaign that painted Singh black over a perceived Rs 36,000-crore rice scam, reminding the voters at every rally about a diary seized by the CBI that had the names of the chief ministers relatives as bribe recipients.There were several scams during Singhs tenure and the chief ministers sons name also cropped up in the Panama Papers. This allowed the Congress to discredit the BJP leadership even as the Congress grappled with its own leadership crisis after the exit of veteran former chief minister Ajit Jogi.While many leaders felt Jogi was primarily responsible for the Congresss plight as he had recklessly indulged in internal sabotage in order to capture the reins of the party, others feared his alliance with Mayawatis BSP would pose a formidable challenge.The BJPs strategy relied on the Jogi factor as the Congress portrayed him as Singhs hidden collaborator. The Jogi-Mayawati tie-up did make an impact, but the people were so angry with the government that the contest became one-sided.The Jogi factor is still alive in the state but the Congress is now powerful enough to handle him according to its own political convenience.Jogi would ideally have liked to merge his party with the Congress and set his sights on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but the current state leadership is vehemently opposed to him.Rahul will have to do a lot of cajoling to get Jogi back into the fold. The Congress high command may adopt that approach to avoid a split in anti-BJP votes in 2019."

promise",http://www.newindianexpress.com/elections/chhattisgarh-elections/2018/dec/11/raman-singh-doling-out-rice-and-mobiles-he-saw-entertainment-in-rahuls-loan-waiver-promise-1910111.html,2018-12-11,"By PTIRAIPUR: Climbing the populism ladder, the BJP's longest-serving chief minister Raman Singh gave rice, mobiles and even medical advice almost free to a large population, but his bid for another shot at ruling Chhattisgarh saw him touching feet of his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath and dismissing Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's aggressive campaign as mere ""entertainment"".He also took jibes at his predecessor Ajit Jogi's alliance with Dalit leader Mayawati for polls in his state with a large population of tribals and other backward castes, saying 'A plough-carrying farmer' does not need an 'Elephant' -- referring to the party symbols of the two leaders who had joined hands to present a third force in an otherwise direct fight between the ruling BJP and the challenger Congress.In the end, the election results showed that farmers, as also tribals and other voters of his state, did not want even 'Lotus' of the saffron party and decided to support the 'Hand' of the Congress.The results, while bringing Congress back to power in this state, also end the rule of the 66-year-old BJP stalwart, who has earned several monikers during his 15-year-long tenure -- 'Doctor Saheb' being a trained Ayurvedic medical practitioner, 'Chaur Wale Baba' for his popular rice scheme and the 'Mobile Wale Baba' for giving free smartphones to 50 lakh women and students.The last time the Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh was in the first three years of the state being carved out of Madhya Pradesh, after which it was Singh who was at the helm -- that too for 15 out of the state's overall history of 18 years.He started as a councillor in his native Kawardha (Kabirdham) district in 1983 before becoming an MLA in 1990 in the undivided Madhya Pradesh and then a Lok Sabha MP in 1999 by defeating Congress veteran Motilal Vora from what became his bastion, Rajnandgaon.Singh, who was inducted into the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government as Minister of State for Commerce and Industry in 1999, was sent back to state politics to lead the BJP in the 2003 assembly polls and steered the saffron party's bid to dethrone the Jogi government of Congress in 2003.While the then Union minister Dilip Singh Judeo, a former royal, was a front-runner for the CM's post at that time, a controversial sting operation extinguished his chances and Singh was put on the hot seat.Singh again led his party to victory in 2008 and 2013 and earned the distinction of being the longest-serving BJP CM since the party was formed in 1980.The only time he suffered a personal poll defeat was to the Congress' Yogeshwar Raj from Kawardha in the MP Assembly polls in 1998.While the Congress has regularly attacked him over issues of corruption, mainly focusing on the civil supply scam, the chit fund scandal and allegations of his son and BJP MP Abhishek Singh holding accounts in foreign banks, he managed to hold on to his own in the state with a slew of populist welfare measures.The BJP's campaign in the run-up to the two-phase assembly polls on November 12 and 20 this year totally centred around Singh, who had started his political journey has a member of the erstwhile Jan Sangh and then of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since the very beginning of the party.Born on October 15, 1952 in a Rajput family in Kawardha town in undivided Madhya Pradesh, to Vighnaharan Singh Thakur, a prominent lawyer of the town, and Sudha Singh, a housewife, Singh obtained a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) degree from Raipur's Government Ayurveda College in 1975.Party functionaries say that, as a doctor, Singh either charged a nominal fee from his patients or none at all.The Congress, however, has continually alleged that the state's public distribution scheme was defrauded of Rs 36,000 crore and a CBI probe led to several officials being booked in 2015.The party has also routinely raked up allegations that Singh's son, Abhishek, a Lok Sabha MP from Rajnandgaon, was mentioned in the Panama Papers leak, a claim he has denied.Left-wing extremism, however, remained the 'Achilles' heel' for the state, with the Congress claiming that 15 years of BJP rule had worsened the Naxal menace, even as Singh continued to claim that Naxalism was on life-support in the system and the affected districts would soon see peace.Singh's government came under fire when a coordinated attack in 2013 on a Congress convoy in Jhiram Valley in Sukma left several senior party leaders including Nandkumar Patel, Vidyacharan Shukla, Mahendra Karma and Uday Mudliyar dead.While the opposition and some from his own party have been critical of his working style and the behaviour of state bureaucrats, Singh, with his amiable, soft-spoken demeanour, generally managed to win the day against dissidence.In the end, political pundits say, it was Congress president Rahul Gandhi's promise of farm loan waiver that turned the elections away from Singh, despite his claims that farmers in his state were already been given zero-interest rate loans.In the meantime, there were also talks about Singh returning to the central politics though he ruled it out saying, 'Abhi Dilli Door Hai (Delhi is far away as yet)'.During the election campaign, while talking to PTI, Singh had also dismissed any impact of Gandhi's extensive campaign in the state and said the Congress chief was ""sort of an entertainment"" only for people in the state and they do not take him seriously."

I dont think anyone has done it so far in Kerala. Her husband Dipin urged her, Why dont you do it then?That was in 2016. Two years later, as Reshma speaks to us, she has already staged Simhanandini a few times in Kerala. The 31-year-old techie, who is the mom of a six-year-old boy, is gearing up even to fly abroad to showcase Simhanandini within a few weeks.The 18th century art form involves a dancer sketching the shape of a lion on the stage with her footprints while doing a kuchipudi performance. Usually, the frame on which the dancer has performed is shown to the audience after the programme to showcase the lion figure. The dance form belongs to the genre of devalaya aaradhana natyams aka prenkhini natyams and was a temple ritual.Devadasis used to perform them during festivals and draw lion, the vehicle of Goddess Kali on rangoli powder sprinkled on floor, before starting rath yathras. Its called Simhanandini as it is performed in Simhanandana thaalam, explains Reshma, who is probably the first artiste to perform it in Kerala.She tells us dancers usually stay away from it as it is an extremely tough item. Each feature of the lion is sketched on the platform below within a stipulated time of the complex thaalam, during the performance. I was taught about the sketching during my training in Hyderabad. However, as far as figuring out the timing is concerned, a dancer needs to perfect it through practice, she says.As part of this dance form, there is also an item called lakshmivaibhavam in which dancers sketch lotus (Mahalakshmi Vaibhavam), and murugastuti in which a peacock is the end result (Mayura Kautvam).As per records, the last performer of this dance form was Kamalambal, a temple dancer, who lived in the 18th century. Renowned kuchipudi guru C R Acharya researched on it and choreographed it in a way that suits the stage, she says. His daughter Voleti Rangamani, who was also part of the extensive research, is Reshmas guru.Its complicated ragas, thaalams and jatis made me think hard for a year, on whether I should take it up at all. But I garnered courage and finally got in touch with Voleti maam, who trained me, says Reshma, who has also trained under renowned gurus like Mythili, Rigatta Girija and also a few from the Kuchipudi village of Andhra Pradesh.She performed Simhanandini for the first time at a Durga Temple near her home in Thiruvananthapuram. The feedback I got was promising and there on, I continued performing at other places too, she says.Reshma also made a YouTube documentary on Simhanandini. Drawing a sketch on a frame of rice or rangoli powder along with dancing isnt easy and, in the beginning, it would hurt your leg too, she says. Practising the art form at home was also a tough process, as it had to be done on the specially-made rangoli/rice powder platform.I have been performing kuchipudi for long now. I feel the pain during the initial training period of learning kuchipudi is more and that makes you tough to endure what you have to go through while performing Simhanandini, she says.Reshma, who has been into dance from the age of four, was a regular face at school youth festivals and was the district kalathilakam of Thiruvananthapuram in 2000. She was also the winner of many laurels including the Young Talent Award last year from the Ministry of Culture and the Balasree Award a few years ago.The young dancer credits her husband Dipin for all the encouragement. He is also the one who sets the frame on stage for my Simhanandini performance. There are many things that need to be ensured to get the sketch right, and Dipin knows it better than me, she says.On his future plans, she says, My dream is to put together a production and also be innovative with Simhanandini, as I believe thats imperative for any art form to survive.In Video: Simhanandini: When a lion is born of dance moves"
5ce5cf90e8e3fc56af40f1a0,Cultivable area fast dwindling in Madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cultivable-area-fast-dwindling-in-madurai/article25707265.ece,2018-12-10,"Sixty-nine-year-old Paramasivam, a farmer from Vadipatti block in Madurai, has an important question for Public Works Development engineers.While submitting a petition to Collector S. Natarajan at the recent weekly grievance day meeting, he asked him: Where is the water for irrigation?Speaking to The Hindu , he said, over the last 10 to 15 years, a majority of cultivable land in the district had shrunk due to various reasons. Out of the 13 revenue blocks, water from Mullaperiyar reservoir was fed into channels to benefit only five blocks - Vadipatti, Madurai East, Madurai West, Alanganallur and Melu.Armed with data obtained from Agriculture and Revenue departments, he said that in Madurai East block alone the cultivable area was 8,800 hectares in 2011. It shrunk to 2,570 ha in 2017 (due to drought) and in 2018, it stood at less than 6,500 ha, which means it had almost halved in less than six years.When this was the input from the agriculture officers, PWD officials maintained that water was released for 8,800 ha. When the actual water released or water consumed was only for 2,570 ha in 2017 and 6,500 ha in 2018 (as per records), how is that the PWD maintained it was right.Mr. Paramasivam again approached the PWD officials. They came up with a different interpretation this time, stating that water meant for irrigation was being distributed for drinking purpose. They even cited that residents in Theni district opposed the diversion by Madurai Corporation through a drinking water project that was built at a whopping cost of Rs. 1,100 crore.In many blocks, particularly in Madurai East, what was once classified as agriculture land had been reclassified for housing and industrial use in the recent years, he noted.Technology comes handyAn agriculture official said that though cultivable area had shrunk by almost 50% in the district, the yield had not come down. On the contrary, farmers have gained with the aid of technology. In the beginning of 2000, when the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technique was launched, only 5% of farmers evinced interest to switch over from conventional method. Today, over a period of 15 years, almost 70% of paddy growers have taken to the SRI technique. Not only do they save on cost, but water and labour too were minimal, the officer said.Former Additional Director (Agriculture) S. Kanagaraj said that rainfall pattern decided the extent of cultivable area. It differed from season to season. With global warming, within the district, rainfall levels varied from one location to another, thus depriving farmers of getting full benefit from rain, he added.Summer rain goodAn agriculturist, Vijayrajan, said that based on the normal rainfall data they should get 20% of the annual rainfall from January to May and 80% rainfall during the two monsoons.Sharing a few key points from the data furnished, he said, the important things were: In the last 15 years, during winter (January - February), we received more than the normal rainfall of 35.40 mm only in two years. Although this season accounted for only about 4 % of the expected annual rainfall, a couple of good wet spells during these months helped save paddy crop and other rain dependent crops. The last time the district received some decent rains was in February 2013 with 41.83 mm. The summer (March - May) rain had actually been the only season where we received average rainfall above the normal expected rainfall (at 135%). While this is helpful, the rainwater doesnt get stored in tanks and percolates into the ground and evaporates quickly due to the summer heat.Further, Mr. Vijayrajan said that during the two monsoon seasons, the region usually received about 80% of its annual rainfall. The rainfall over the years (2004 -17) is close to the average at 89% (S.W) and 98% (N.E) respectively. However, the average doesnt tell the whole story since there has been very large variations in particular years. Especially, the N.E. monsoon had seen a large excess in three years - 2005, 2010 and 2011, and had averaged the poor rainfall in other years. The N.E. monsoon after being excess in 2011 had been below average for an extended period since 2012 onwards (30% below normal from 2012-2017).The N.E monsoon is the most important for our region since it not only accounts for about 46% of annual rainfall but is largely responsible for agriculture and groundwater recharge. This deficit from 2012 onwards had largely led to the failure and distress in agriculture and in the depleting groundwater table.The Madurai Corporation can examine modalities to introduce turn system from January 2019 as storage in Vaigai dam stands at less than 60 feet. We can expect water into the dam from Mullaiperiyar only by June 2019 when the S.W. monsoon sets in, he says.Rainfall level decides the extent of cultivable area, but due to global warming, it varies from place to placeS.

5ce5d636e8e3fc56af40f4dc,are farmers all over India on the streets?,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-farmers-all-over-india-on-the-streets/article25701364.ece,2018-12-09,"What happened?Mass farmer protests have erupted across the country over the past few months from Maharashtra to Bengal, with the October march in Delhi leading to violent clashes with the police. Farm distress has been on top of the agenda for political parties in the Assembly elections.What is the problem?Apart from the headline-grabbing protests, data show evidence of farm distress. National Crime Records Bureau statistics show more than 3 lakh farmers have killed themselves in the last two decades. Indebtedness was cited as the reason for more than 55% of farmers suicides in 2015. Maharashtra, which saw the highest number of farmers suicides, has 57% of its farm families in debt. NSSO data show more than half of all farmers are in debt, with each household owing an average of Rs. 47,000. In States like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where levels of indebtedness are around 90%, the average debt of a household hovers around Rs. 1 lakh. Almost 70% of agricultural households spend more than they earn and almost a quarter of all farmers live below the poverty line. Census data for 2011 show the number of cultivators who own land have been overtaken by landless agricultural workers for the first time. Many of these 144 million workers earn less than Rs. 150 a day working in the fields, and the failure to generate jobs in other parts of the economy gives them few options.What are the reasons for this?Long-term issues include the increasing fragmentation of land  average plot sizes are barely more than one hectare  a lack of post-production infrastructure, marketing mechanisms and supply chains. The last two years have actually seen record farm output in most major crops, but the resultant glut has led to crashing prices. At the same time, input costs have spiked, with diesel prices surging 26% this year and fertilizer costs shooting up more than 15%. Demonetisation was a blow to many in the rural cash economy. The move affected farmers ability to buy seeds and fertilizers, pay off loans and hire farm labour, according to an initial Agriculture Ministry report to a parliamentary panel last month. The Ministry later rescinded its report, but farmers groups say the long-term impact of the note ban lingers.What is the government doing?The M.S. Swaminathan Commission had recommended that the minimum support prices for 23 major crops be set at 1.5 times the cost of production, and the government claims it has fulfilled its promises to do so. However, the governments calculation of the cost of production only includes actual paid-out costs and the imputed cost of family labour, while the Commissions formula also included the imputed cost of capital and the rent on the land. Moreover, the government only procures wheat, rice and a limited amount of pulses and oilseeds at MSP rates, benefiting only a fraction of farmers. While loan waivers are a popular poll promise and have been implemented in some States, small farmers without access to institutional credit are often left out.What policy solutions lie ahead?A government panel aiming to double farmers income by 2022 has come up with a 13-volume report, but its final set of policy recommendations is still pending with the Agriculture Ministry. It is expected to focus on ways to ensure sustainability of production, monetisation of farmers produce, re-strengthening of extension services and recognising agriculture as an enterprise and enabling it to operate as such by addressing structural weaknesses. This week, the Cabinet approved an agriculture export policy, lifting restrictions on organic and processed food, which it hopes will double farm exports by 2022 and widen the market for domestic produce. Farmers groups are urging political parties to support two private member Bills introduced in the last session of Parliament for guaranteed implementation of MSP and a comprehensive loan waiver and debt reduction scheme. However, they have also come out with a wider charter of demands, which deals with input costs, social security, farm workers employment, land rights, irrigation, agro-ecology, crop insurance and contract farming.Priscilla Jebaraj"

A crusader for revival of traditional paddy varieties, he had breathed his last at a private hospital in Chennai on Thursday. His body was brought to his native place on Thursday night after several political leaders including DMK president M K Stalin paid homage at a residence of his relative in Chennai.A large number of people queued up at his house at Kattimedu to pay their last respects to the man who spent a major part of his life for the revival of about 170 traditional paddy varieties. He also popularised the seeds by conducting national paddy festival in the past few years, a service which earned him the name Nel Jayaraman. Food minister R Kamaraj said the state government would bear the expenses incurred on his treatment. Leaders of farmers associations insisted on displaying the revived paddy varieties at the Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute in Aaduthurai. Jayaraman was honoured with Best Organic Farmer award by the state government in 2012 and 2013 and Genome Saviour award by the central government.For the last three months since he was admitted to a private hospital in Chennai for cancer treatment, Nel Jayaraman has been reliving memories of the journeys that he made into the rural pockets in search of paddy seeds. The humble farmer had started a journey with his guru Nammalvar more than a decade ago and his followers say the death will not stop the journey. At least 125 traditional paddy seeds that he revived have been documented. Jayaraman even brought out a book in Tamil with details about each seed that he collected from farmers. The book on native paddy varieties and their medicinal qualities even has numbers of farmers from whom the seeds had been collected.Senior agriculture journalist M J Prabhu, who accompanied Jayaraman in his seed-collection drive, described how Jayaramans initiative helped laid-back places like Kancheepuram get back to farming. Today, Kancheepuram boasts of three seed banks. Jayaraman gave 13 seeds specific to the region, he said.A school dropout-turned-farmer, Jayaraman revived the seeds as part of the Save our Rice (SoR) Campaign, a national movement aimed at conserving traditional varieties of paddy. It was through various experiments and observations that Jayaraman realised that native varieties of paddy are best suited for the coastal districts, which are prone to climatic variations."

Swaminathan, which describes Bt cotton as a failure, was criticised by Indias Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA), K . VijayRaghavan as deeply flawed.The paper, Modern Technologies for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security appears in the latest issue of the peer-reviewed journal Current Science . It is authored by P.C. Kesavan and Dr. Swaminathan, who are both senior functionaries of the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF). The article is a review of crop development in India and transgenic crops  particularly Bt cotton, the stalled Bt brinjal as well as DMH-11, a transgenic mustard hybrid. The latter two have been cleared by scientific regulators but not by the Centre.There is no doubt that GE (genetically engineered) Bt cotton has failed in India. It has failed as a sustainable agriculture technology and has therefore also failed to provide livelihood security for cotton farmers who are mainly resource-poor, small and marginal farmers, according to the paper, The precautionary principle (PP) has been done away with and no science-based and rigorous biosafety protocols and evaluation of GM crops are in place.Flawed and full of errorsThe piece also raises questions on the genetic engineering technology itself on the grounds that it raises the cost of sowing, and the insertion of foreign genes (in the plant) could lead to molecular and cellular events not precisely understood.The Kesavan and Swaminathan Review (sic) is deeply flawed and full of errors. Needs scientific rebuttal, Mr. VijayRaghavan tweeted from this personal account. Before being appointed the PSA, Mr. VijayRaghavan, a biologist, was Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, which funds a variety of molecular biology projects. Mr. Kesavan, who is the lead author of the piece, told The Hindu that he was unaware of Mr. VijayRaghavans comment but was expecting a scientific, point-by-point response (of any flaws).Im not on Twitter but I believe a senior scientist shouldnt be making such irresponsible comments, he said. The Hindu reached out to Dr. Swaminathans office and was told that the paper had raked up a lot of controversy.Press conference soonWell likely soon be holding a press conference or a discussion on some of the points raised since the paper was published, a spokesperson for the MSSRF said.Mr. VijayRaghavan said in a text message that he wouldnt be immediately elaborating on his criticism but would in a few days.Last resortMr. Swaminathan, credited with leading Indias Green Revolution, has in recent years advocated sustainable agriculture and said the government should only use genetic engineering as a last resort. Swaminathan emphasised that genetic engineering technology is supplementary and must be needbased. Only in very rare circumstance (less than 1%) may there arise a need for the use of this technology, according to the paper.However, the MSSRF also dabbles in GE research. It has a programme on developing drought-resistant GM rice by using genes from mangroves to potentially protect rice varieties grown along the coasts from being affected by higher saline content  a consequence of warming seas from climate change. The programme is ongoing but isnt aimed for the present. Genes from salt-tolerant plants too arent idealhowever GE may be deployed to manage against abiotic stresses, said Kesavan. Abiotic stresses refer to environmental factors that could meddle with plant yield, as opposed to biotic stressors such as insects."

Instead, the management was procuring sugarcane grown in Mandya.Also, he demanded payment of an additional Rs. 300 over the Rs. 2,650 a quintal of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) announced by the government in view of the high costs incurred by farmers.He said the ZP CEO had constituted a task force to study the complaints made by sugarcane farmers against the sugar factory.

Besides its taste, the price tag of Rs. 40 per meal made it a big hit.Considering the huge volume of plastic waste generated when people purchase food through online portals, Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has made a special arrangement with the Kudumbashree unit for supply of lunch packed in 300 dabbas to personnel manning the stations, including policemen.Green ProtocolWe wanted to adhere to the Green Protocol where plastic is a big no and hence wanted to extend the service to 16 metro stations as well, said KMRL managing director A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish.Aimed at combating plastic, the metro agency has already opened a plastic-collection point and shredding unit at its Palarivattom station. Our dabba initiative got a shot in the arm with Eastern Group sponsoring 300 three-tiered steel lunch containers under its corporate social responsibility scheme, said Radhika Lalan of Mythri.The lunch package costing Rs. 40 includes Jaya rice with sambar, curd, and fish curry / fry / chicken curry. Ten out of our 20 team members are engaged in making food for the metro personnel. Plans are afoot to supply breakfast and dinner too since they are posted in multiple shifts, she added.The team members will converge at Muttom and fan out across the stations in metro trains for which they will be permitted to travel free of cost.They will also collect the empty dabbas and take them back to Choornikkara.Even as KMRL is keen to rope in other caterers who adhere to the Green Protocol, it is still not sure whether anyone will be able to match the Rs. 40 price tag at which the Kudumbashree is supplying non-vegetarian lunch."

We had promised the niece a Chinese dinner. But I thought Id look at other options, too. I surfed the net and discovered a food site called Yum Yum South. But there was a glitch (I was ordering from the wrong site, as I later discovered), and I had to go back to the original plan of lemon chicken and crispy lamb. Then a few days ago, when I was getting a bit tired of my daily paneer, I went back to Yumyumsouth.com. This time I ordered from the site itself  and ended up with a delicious south Indian dinner.First, let me tell you about the outlet. It has branches across the city. The closest to my part of town is the one in Ghazipur. The food arrived within an hour. It was packed very well, too. The food was in small containers, in cheerful yellow cartons  with those quaint messages and images that most people in the north associate southern films with. There was a woman with dark glasses, a man with dark glasses, and two one-liners  Enna rascala and Eat it, mind it.We love our idlis and upma, so we asked for a plate of Deccan Delight (upma, idli, vada: Rs. 179) and mini idlis coated with podi, served with sambar and chutneys (Rs. 160). Then we ordered Mysore chicken with rice (Rs. 265), coconut chicken (Rs. 265) and lemon rice (with pickle and raita: Rs. 169). We got a complimentary bottle of spiced buttermilk (Rs. 99).Mildly spicedThe food was excellent. The chicken was soft and just mildly spiced. The chicken and gravy had the taste and flavour of coconut milk. The Mysore chicken with rice was rather similar to the other chicken dish I had ordered. I wanted to order the Kochi chicken pepper fry with parottas but wasnt sure if I could take the spices. The idlis and upma were superb. We had the mini idlis the next day for breakfast, and found them soft and moist. The sambar it came with was rather good, too  thick, mildly sweet and full of vegetables.The lemon rice was a bit disappointing. The rice was a bit too dry, I thought. But I enjoyed the raita  there was a separate container with some thick yoghurt, and another little box with crispy boondis in it.There is a lot more on the menu  such as Allepey style mutton ghee roast with parottas, spicy Chettinad chicken with parottas, Kottayam fish curry with rice, kadi patta peas masala and paneer 65 with laccha paratha. From what I could tell, the menu is not the same in every outlet.For the health freaks, they have beetroot idlis, ragi masala dosa and oats dosa. I would like to try out their sabudana khichri (sabudana, diced potatoes, peanuts, coconut powder, desi ghee, cumin seeds, curry leaves) and idli chaat (fried idlis in yoghurt, mint and tamarind chutney and crispy boondi).But before that, I have to call the friends and the much loved niece over one day for a south Indian dinner. I owe them one."
5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"

The move on a stable trade policy regime will minimise the practice of export curbs, assuring farm exporters of no interference from the government unless it is urgently needed to keep domestic prices under check. Export of organic products will, however, have no restrictions.Commerce minister Suresh Prabhu said the export policy would seek to remove all kinds of export restrictions on organic products. He added that the move was aimed at boosting export of agriculture commodities such as tea, coffee and rice and increase the countrys share in global agri trade.The cabinet also approved the proposal for establishment of monitoring framework at the Centre to oversee implementation of agriculture export policy. The monitoring framework will have representations from various central ministries and agencies, and concerned state governments. The government has come out with a policy to double farmers income by 2022. Exports of agricultural products would play a pivotal role in achieving this goal, said an official statement. It said the move would integrate Indian farmers and agricultural products with global value chains.The policy will promote cluster approach where identified districts would be developed as cluster to promote export through setting up entire value chain for particular area-specific farm produce. Besides, the policy would focus on all aspects of agricultural exports including modernising infrastructure, standardisation of products, streamlining regulations, curtailing knee-jerk decisions and focusing on research and development activities.According to an estimate, implementation of the policy will have financial implication of over Rs 1,400 crore."

For the last three months since he was admitted to a private hospital in the city, Nel Jayaraman struggled to strike a balance. Apparently, the memories took over most of the time, making him talk about the seeds he revived to those who visited him at hospital. But the humble farmer, who revived more than 170 traditional paddy seeds since he began a journey with his guru Nammalvar more than a decade ago, breathed his last on Thursday morning.Doctors in Apollo Speciality Cancer Hospital at Teynampet said his condition turned critical on Wednesday and the end came at 5.19am on Thursday. He was 54 and is survived by his wife and a son.The death of Jayaraman, however, will never stop the journey. At least 125 traditional paddy seeds that he revived have been documented. Jayaraman even brought out a book in Tamil with details of each seed that he collected from farmers. The book on native paddy varieties and their medicinal qualities even has numbers of farmers from whom the seeds had been collected.M J Prabhu, an agri journalist, who accompanied Jayaraman in his seed-collection drive, said Jayaramans initiative helped laid-back places like Kancheepuram get back to farming. Today, Kancheepuram boasts of three seed banks. Jayaraman gave 13 seeds specific to the region. Its because of his contribution that many raise eyebrows and foreign media, farmers and scientists are visiting the seed banks, he said.A school dropout-turned farmer, Jayaraman revived the seeds as part of the Save our Rice (SoR) Campaign, a national movement aimed at conserving traditional varieties of paddy. A native of Thiruthuraipoondi near Adirangam in Tiruvarur district, it was through various experiments and observations that Jayaraman realised that native varieties of paddy are best suited for the coastal districts, which are prone to climatic variations. Jayaraman has won the Best Organic Farmer Award in 2012 and 2013 from the state agriculture department.It was a turning point in the history of paddy cultivation when Jayaraman began distributing the revived native seeds to the farmers by organizing seed festivals every year in Adhirengam, his native village. This great service gave him a name Nel Jayaraman. A month ago, 51 rice lines from Jayaramans collection were handed over to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research to be preserved in a vault at the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR).Jayaraman was working on developing a transparent market to help traditional farmers get good price for their products. The organic agriculture has lost a giant whose vacuum cant be filled, said Prabhu.Chief minister K Palaniswami, DMK president M K Stalin and other party leaders condoled the death of Jayaraman. His mortal remains were shifted to his native place Thiruthuraipoondi where cremation will take place on Friday."

Mr. Singh said that the matter would be brought to the notice of Parliament. Revenue Additional Chief Secretary P.H. Kurian made a presentation on the post-flood operations being carried out in the State before the Finance Parliamentary Committee chaired by Veerappa Moily, MP,Mr. Moily said the sitting was aimed at collecting first-hand information about the post-flood situation in the State and to speed up the assistance. This is not aimed at finding the shortcomings but to understand the reality. Keralas health sector deserves appreciation for checking the outbreak of epidemics after the flood, he said.Study on disastersA high-level meeting of Chief Secretaries and officials will be held after conducting a study on the recent disasters in Kerala, Kudagu and Tamil Nadu and a report will be submitted to Parliament, Mr. Moily said.Mr. Kurian reminded the panel that the State had to face multiple disasters in the form of drought, Cyclone Ockhi and outbreak of Nipah in the last two years. The flood had inflicted a loss of Rs. 26,720 crore on the State. As per an UN report, around Rs. 31,000 crore was needed to overcome the loss and to restore the State to previous condition.Around 7 lakh houses and 3.5 lakh wells had to be sanitised in the aftermath of the flood. Over 7.15 lakh relief kits were distributed to the flood-hit. Mr. Kurian told the committee about the governments various projects for the reconstruction of 2.60 lakh damaged houses.So far, the Chief Ministers Distress Relief Fund has received contributions to the tune of Rs. 2,700 crore. Aid worth Rs. 214 crore had been received from the State Disaster Management Fund while Rs. 600 crore had been extended as additional advance allocation from the Central Disaster Management Fund. So far, Rs. 601.85 crore had been spent from the State Disaster Response Fund. Bills worth Rs. 700 crore are ready for issuance. An additional assistance of Rs. 5,615 crore has been sought from the Central Disaster Response Fund, out of which Rs. 600 crore was received. The assistance worth Rs. 2500 crore sought under various projects from NABARD and special GST cess for reconstruction has not yet been allocated, the committee was told. The Central government has been approached for funds needed for the distribution of free rice and kerosene in the flood-hit areas and additional one time assistance package of Rs. 5,000 crore.Even if the Centre was to allocate the assistance sought from it, the State would still need more funds towards its reconstruction. Aid worth $100 crore has been offered by the Asian Development Bank, European Union and World Bank. The Parliament Committee was also asked to consider the exception in loan limits."

He was 54.Adirangam, his native place in Tiruvarur district, is a famous Vaishnavite pilgrimage centre. In recent times, it turned into a hub of Paddy Festival, which was visited by many farmers every year. Jayaraman practised organic farming.Closely associated with CREATE, a consumer organisation, Jayaraman had been organising the paddy festival since 2005 and distributed 2 kg of traditional paddy seeds to farmers and they had to return 4 kg after harvest. He became so popular that the word Nel (paddy) became part of his name.Jayaraman, the State coordinator of Save Our Rice campaign, began with the distribution of 15 paddy varieties and increased to 64 varieties. He collected seeds of over 170 paddy varieties and organised training programme for cultivating them.Though the Cauvery delta region is known as the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu, it faced natural calamities year after year.Encouraged by late natural agronomist Nammalvar, he collected information about the diversity in traditional paddy in coastal areas as they have the potential to withstand climate variations.His enthusiasm earned the goodwill of an NRI from his village and he donated nine acres for crop cultivation and for organising training programmes, said S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Association.Mr. Ranganathan said traditional paddy grew very tall and the haystack was used to cover the roof of huts.Important varietiesAccording to Jayaramans website, some of the important varieties he maintained were Kattuyanam (best suited for flood condition), Poongkar (suited for saline soil), Karunguruvai (best for making biriyani), Kuzhiyadichan (for alkaline soil), Kudavaalai , Gauvuni , Mappillai Samba (for high energy), Samba Mosanam (best suited for making flat rice), Arupatham Kuruvai (short duration variety of 60 days).The website also gives details about traditional varieties, their special characters and land suitable for their cultivation. All the varieties can be easily cultivated under the SRI (System of Rice Intensification) method, it adds.He received the Best Organic Farmer award of the Tamil Nadu government in 2011 and the Central Governments Genome Saviour award and was invited to the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines. After he was diagnosed with cancer, actor Sivakarthikeyan admitted him to a private hospital and volunteered to take care of the educational expenditure of his son.Chief Minister Edappadi K.

Jayaraman is credited with tracing and reviving scores of traditional paddy varieties.Mannargudi S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, said Jayaraman would be remembered for his contribution to revive traditional paddy varieties, some of which were almost extinct, with the help of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University and others.His contribution was recognised by International Rice Research Institute too. It was unfortunate that he could not complete some of his research work. It is the duty of the government to take up his project and ensure the continuation of the good work done by Jayaraman, he said.The farm at Adirengam where he was working could be made a memorial for Nammazhvar and Jayaraman, he said.Echoing similar sentiments, Puliyur A. Nagarajan, president, farmers wing of Tamil Maanila Congress, said the Agriculture Department should establish a conservatory-cum-research centre on traditional paddy varieties in the delta districts in memory of Jayaraman.Stating that Jayaramans death had caused distress among organic farmers, Arupathi P. Kalyanam, general secretary, Federation of Farmers Association of Delta Districts, said the traditional varieties that he had helped revive would stand testimony to his contributions for centuries.His dedication and simplicity won him several awards, he said.Recalling his efforts to promote traditional paddy varieties, Chandramohan, State general secretary, All India Kisan Mahasabha, said, Jayaraman continues to live in every seed of traditional varieties that he revived."

The 50-member crew headed by Pazhayidom Mohanan Namboothiri, the chef-in-charge of the festival for over a decade, keep scurrying around preparing the first meal for the participants.But unlike previous years the organisers have set a different serving style this time as instead of one sprawling mess hall, food will be available in four venues, that too in buffet system. This is a budget festival but there wont be any compromise on quality, says Namboothiri.While he is preparing food for free, the Kerala State Teachers Association (KSTA) has sponsored the food for all three days. The KSTA had happily agreed to fund the amount required to feed the participants, parents, teachers and officials during the festival.

On the last day, we will serve Ambalappuzha palpayasam, he says.Green, for sureThe kitchen will follow the guidelines of green protocol, opting for reusable steel plates to minimise waste generation. We could have offered more items, but this time we are not following the traditional sadya format. Since we are opting for steel plates and buffet system, its not possible to add extra dishes, says Ms. Sreedevi. The 29 venues of the festival have been divided into four clusters. Mess halls will function in four venues, including EMS Stadium, SDV Ground, Government UP School, Thiruvampady, MIH School, Poonkavu."

The department officials also mentioned that they would conduct awareness programmes in rural areas of the district, since a few unregistered annadhanams continued to take place there only.The designated officer (DO) for the district food safety department, Dr R Chitra said that since several religious functions  especially Vaikunda Ekadasi  are scheduled very soon, the department would come up with strict measures so that annadhanams are done hygienically and as per the guidance. On Sunday, 46 people, including children suffered from food poisoning after they consumed food during a Mariamman temple function at Umaiyalpuram village. While a few received treatment at the Musiri government hospital, four children were referred to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH).Buttermilk, sundal (chickpeas), pearl millet porridge and curd rice were served for the devotees. Weve sent the food sample for testing and based on the result, we would take further action, food safety officer, Musiri block, M Vadivel said. He added that no one had registered with the department for conducting annadhanam at the temple.In the last three years, Trichy has seen two major mass food poisonings - one during a festival at Samayapuram temple in which more than 100 people fell ill, while about 100 fell sick at a private family function due to contaminated water served there. After these incidents, the number of people who register with us to organise annadhanams increased, an official told TOI.About 750 people have registered to perform annadhanam throughout Trichy district at present. Whenever theres a registered annadhanam event, the organisers are directed to keep food sample separately which would be tested by the department. While using a different oil was cited as reason for food poisoning this time, generally such cases are due to serving decayed food, spoilt milk, contaminated water or expired ingredients. A source from the department said that most of the cases were unintentional and due to ignorance. In some cases, items like mutton biryani and other non-vegetarian dishes are served to very young children too, the official added."

He was suffering from cancer.Doctors in Apollo Speciality Cancer Hospital at Teynampet , where Jayaraman was undergoing treatment, said his condition turned critical on Wednesday and he died at 5.19am on Thursday.Jayaraman was 54 and is survived by wife and a son.Jayaraman started his journey with organic guru G Nammalwar to revive the lost seeds in 2004. He could initially collect only 15 varieties.He cultivated them in his village and then distributed the same to farmers in the first Nel Vizha (paddy seed festival) that he organised in his native village Adirangam in Tiruvarur district in 2006. The festival got good response from farmers and agricultural experts.Jayaraman continued his journey in search of the lost paddy seeds and collected 169 seeds.A couple of weeks ago, 51 rice lines from Jayaramans collection were handed over to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research to be preserved in a vault of the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR)  a great recognition for a humble farmer like Jayaraman."

The chemical is carcinogenic and is naturally found in water supplies and soil, particularly in parts of North-east India and Bangladesh.Arsenate is the most abundant form of arsenic and is structurally similar to phosphate.Therefore, it is easily incorporated in to plant cells through phosphate uptake pathway the process of the roots absorbing nutrients.However, when a plant absorbs arsenic it can translocate it up to the edible part of the plant ultimately arsenic enters food chain.Plants have an inherent capacity to cope with arsenic stress by producing metal-chelating peptides called phyochelatins (PCs).PCs detoxify the arsenic and restrict the movement of arsenic in the roots, which in turn helps to reduce the root-to-shoot translocation of arsenic.Phyochelatins are therefore essential in trapping the arsenic absorbed by the plant in the roots.Scientists at the University of Warwick wanted to make plants with more phytochelatins in the roots, to stop any of the arsenic escaping and travelling up the shoot to the edible part of the plant.The university said this is being done by making transgenic plants with reduced cytokinin hormone in the roots, which means phytochelatin is boosted and can detoxify and hold more arsenic in the root."

The two IAS officers were cited to have clandestine approval for it.After the scam was exposed on February 12, 2015 during the ACB/EOW extensive raids in the civil supplies corporation headquarter and 28 other locations, the opposition Congress trained its gun against the Raman Singh government accusing it of being involved in rice scam cited to the tune of Rs 36000.During the raids, the ACB recovered Rs 3.64 crore cash and some incriminating documents from nearly a dozen officials who were then arrested and sent to jail. After the ACB investigations, as many as 18 people were made the accused in the case. The state sought the Centre's approval, which was granted some two years ago, for prosecuting Shukla, the then food secretary and Tuteja who was Chhattisgarh State Civil Supplies Corporation managing director.""Both the officers were issued the notices on December 4 and the court asked them to remain present when the ACB was to produce the charges against them"", said the public prosecutor Yogendra Tamrakar. According to officials of the ACB, after the court's warrant both the officials will soon be arrested. So far there are 294 witnesses in the PDS scam case. Some days ago the court had cancelled the petition of Anil Tuteja who sought anticipatory bail.The court proceedings in the given case will continue and statements of more witnesses will be recorded, he added. The PDS rice scam was raked-up by the Congress as one of the major issues during the recent election campaigns."

5ce5f36de8e3fc56af41073b,Cutting through the smog,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cutting-through-the-smog/article25667099.ece,2018-12-05,"Incidents of stubble burning  following the harvest of paddy crop in Punjab and Haryana  cannot be averted by imposing fines, or giving notice or giving farmers capital subsidy. Instead, the issue requires long-term vision and strategic policy interventions.Air pollution is a worry especially in north India. Stubble burning is said to be a key factor behind the formation of a dense cover of smog in this part of India though its contribution is less than 20%. Farmers are held responsible for the crisis but what is at fault are the flawed and short-sighted policies of the Central and State governments.Policy of rotationIn the 1960s, wheat-paddy crop rotation was encouraged in Punjab and Haryana to make India self-sufficient in foodgrain production. Large public investments in irrigation and adoption of high yielding varieties under the Green Revolution helped achieve the goal and make the nation food secure. However, the negative externalities in terms of land degradation, adverse soil health due to overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and plummeting water tables have surfaced.The share of paddy (rice) in the gross cropped area in Punjab has increased from 6.8% in 1966-67 to almost 36.4 % in recent years, while it has increased from 4.97% to 20% in Haryana. The increase has undisputedly been at the cost of the area under maize, cotton, oilseeds and sugarcane. The policy of minimum support price for crops, in tandem with their assured procurement and input subsidy, have left farmers with no option but to follow this rotation. Besides, Punjab enacted a water conservation law in 2009 which mandates paddy sowing within a notified period (some time in June instead of the earlier practice in May). A shorter period of sowing days prohibits transplantation before a notified date, which in turn limits the window available for harvesting paddy to between 15 and 20 days. As a result, farmers who are pressed for time to sow wheat and maintain crop yield find stubble burning to be an easy and low-cost solution.One possibility to curtail the practice is to ensure that the government encourages crop diversification towards less water-intensive crops by extending price incentives and better marketing facilities. In some districts, farmers have started growing kinnow fruit but are often dissuaded due to high price volatility and the absence of a market. The policy of a price deficiency system  as initiated in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh  should be adopted to strengthen the production and marketing of alternative crops. Another option is to replicate the Telangana model of providing farmers an investment support of Rs. 8,000 per acre each year and withdraw price-based support.Punjab faces another serious problem: labour shortage. In the Agricultural Census 2011, average land-holding size has increased from 2.89 hectares in 1970-71 to 3.77 hectares in 2010-11  higher than the national average of 1.5 hectares. Paucity of labour for various farm operations is substituted by machines for which the government extends financial support.A road mapFarmers have already made investments in seed drill machines for sowing wheat after paddy harvest. Increasing pressure by the government on farmers to purchase the happy seeder to abate stubble burning adds to the cost incurred by farmers. Even if the machine is available at a subsidised rate of nearly Rs. 1 lakh, it would remain idle the whole year and become a liability in terms of maintenance. It is not a viable option for small and marginal farmers who hardly earn Rs. 60,000 in a year. Imposing a fine for burning straw is again unreasonable. The fine imposed per hectare is much lower than the cost incurred on a happy seeder.A feasible remedy could lie in the setting up of custom hiring centres or inviting companies to make investments for rental purposes. If the state provides an app-based support system, to rent out tractors and farm implements and earn additional income  there are examples of this in Nigeria and also in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  it would be akin to the Uberisation of agriculture. It would avoid stubble burning and at the same time make farming more mechanised, cost effective and a source of employment.Another far-sighted approach could be in effective use of paddy straw. Unlike wheat residue, which is used as fodder, paddy straw is non-palatable to animals as it has high silica content. Farmers, who have already been sensitised to refrain from burning residue, should be given options such as biomass generation. Now, hardly 20% of straw is managed through biomass power plants, paper and cardboard mills. The government should use geospatial techniques to identify areas where stubble burning is severe and encourage installation of biomass plants at such locations. This will not only reduce transportation costs for the firm or village entrepreneurs but also help the government achieve its target of generating 227GW based on renewable energy sources by 2022. Farmers can also be incentivised to sell the residual for additional income. The residual has uses, such as in paper, cardboard and packing material making and also hydroseeding (defiberised rice straw can be used in hydroseeding for erosion control).Seema Bathla and Ravi Kiran are Professor and Research Scholar, respectively, at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi"
