Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday sprang a surprise on voters of the Nalgonda Assembly constituency, saying he had wanted to contest the election from here.But people of my constituency, Gajwel, witnessing the development made by me, didnt want me to leave, he said.Addressing several Praja Ashirwada meetings, in his fourth visit to the united district, Mr. Rao said ideologue of the Telangana movement Jayashankar had suggested to him that he contest from Mahabubnagar.However, if TRS nominee K. Bhupal Reddy won the election here, he would adopt the constituency, which had lacked infrastructure and largely remained unchanged.Mr. Rao, who was earlier in Kodad, Huzurnagar and Miryalaguda, said the difference between the rule of the TRS and that of the Congress or the Telugu Desam Party, was clear to everyone, and urged people to vote consciously.The Chief Minister remarked that the Bharatiya Janata Party-launched initiatives were not even 10% match to those in Telangana.In Kodad, Mr. Rao reminded people that nominee Bollam Mallaiah Yadav was from the Backward Classes, and asked them to make the best of the opportunity by choosing him.For Miryalaguda and Huzurnagar, dotted with cement industries and rice mills, mutual single permit directions would be discussed with AP.With bangaru Telangana, farmers in the State would have Rs. 5 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh in their bank accounts, he said."

For the novenas and feast of St Francis Xavier , the corridors of the four century-old Basilica teem with the enthusiasm of pilgrims, many of whom have come from far and wide to make the great Jesuit missionarys final resting place their own home.And their dedication to the patron is quite clear  they attend the novena masses on all nine days, often waking up in the wee hours for the first mass. For some of these groups, this is a decades-long tradition. A particular bunch of pilgrims from Margao have been doing this for as long as they can remember. Packing rice and other food from home, they cook on firewood behind the Basilica, and dont wish for any other accommodation.Unfailingly, year after year, they take ten days off their busy lives and flock to the abode of St Francis Xavier. Goencho Saib is our protector, so how can we not make time to come and stay in his temple? asks Succorine. He will help and give us what he has to give us.Also regulars at the Basilica are devotees from the Koli fishing comunity in Vasai . They arrived on Friday for the final few days of the novenas, and will return on Tuesday, just in time to sell their husbands catch. Like their fellow-pilgrims from Margao, they too carry fish and meat in ice, and cook in large utensils behind the Basilica.We are all Christians, said one devotee from Vasai, sticking out her thumb tattooed with a cross.We dont like to go to a hotel. We bring all the food from home and like to stay close to the mandir, she said, adding that for them, St Francis Xavier is immortal.In the swarm of pilgrims is some serious academic presence, too. From Kuzhithurai in southern Tamil Nadi, a group of 60 headmasters and headmistresses from 56 diocesan schools planned their trip to Goa to coincide with the feast. We also celebrate the feast in Tamil Nadi, Leema Rose, one of the headmistresses, said.While the massive crowds that converge in the pandal of the Basilica may be commonplace for Goans, its not so for visitors. Its the first time Ive seen so many people, remarked Sister Ines from Argentina, member of the congregation of the Daughters of the Immaculate Conception of Buenos Aires, based in Belgaum. She attended the feast for the first time, and found everything well organized, and said that despite the numbers and the heat, there was silence. I saw a lot of faith in people, she said.Sister Diana, from Raia, from the same order, was happy to bring her colleagues for the feast. I was in Spain for ten years and thrice visited the castle of St Francis Xavier in Navarra, she said. I have also seen the cross at which his mother cried when she found out that he passed away."

Though the collection centres are at the sites of Large Area Multi-Purpose Societies (LAMPS) in most of the blocks, the district administration said it will buy paddy directly from farmers at the rate of Rs 1,750 per quintal. Currently, about 8,018 farmers are registered as sellers with the district supply officer (DSO) in the district and each farmer has to be registered online for selling their paddy produce this year.""We have provisions to buy 16 quintals of paddy for every acre of cultivated land. For selling their paddy to us, the farmers need to apply for empanelment through the circle officer. Once the area of the cultivated land is physically verified, the paddy is bought from them directly, leaving out middlemen and agencies. It will help them have complete control over their produce for the season,"" said DSO (Ranchi) Narendra Gupta said.This year, the Centre set two different rates for paddy - Rs 1,750 per quintal for the coarse variety, commonly cultivated in Ranchi district, and Rs 1,770 per quintal for the finer quality of rice . ""Though our repository has no records of the finer variety being cultivated, we will send samples for testing if a farmer claims that their crop is of the better variety. Last year, private agencies were engaged in procurement of paddy, but this year we are directly buying produce from the farmers.

As help is pouring in from across the state for the people in the coastal districts, whose livelihoods have been affected by cyclone Gaja, an art teacher from the city is planning to provide relief materials to the affected by selling some of his paintings.P Nandakumar, an art teacher at the CS Academy School in Kovaipudur, has raised Rs 95,000 after selling six of his paintings. He plans to use it to buy rice, blankets and milk powder for the people of a village near Vedaranyam. While I wanted to help people affected by the cyclone, I had no means to do it. All I had was some paintings and Rs 15,000 I got after selling a painting. So, I decided to sell some more to raise funds. I asked my close friends and three of them bought a few more paintings, the 37-year-old man told TOI.One of his friends from Nagapatinam told Nandakumar that a few villages still hadnt got any relief material. We selected Karuppankulam situated between Nagapattinam and Vedaranyam, which has about 200 families. While we have already bought milk powder, mosquito repellents and biscuits, we arranged blankets from Chennimalai and rice from Kangeyam in subsidised rates. We will pick up the materials along the way to the village on Saturday evening, he said.Nandakumar, who has exhibited his works in group shows in New Delhi, Kolkata and Vijayawada, said he had earlier used money got from his paintings to help students in government schools. I have also started a trust to help government schools in need. But I never go ask for funds. I only use money from selling paintings.He plans to sell 50 more paintings to raise funds for his philanthropic work. His panting on organ donation, which was exhibited as part of the art and culture departments show held in August in the district, had earned him praise from the officials and public alike."

The freebie culture, PMKs Anbumani Ramadoss, maintained, was responsible for most of the states ills.The three were discussing The Welfare State: The Future of Freebies, organised by the Times of India on Saturday as part of Times Conversations Even the noon meal scheme had been criticized by former DMK chief M Karunanidhi but he later added eggs to the meal [when he became chief minister] and continued it, Pandiarajan said.While a few states had emulated the free laptops scheme that helped bridge the digital divide, thousands of weavers families had been provided a livelihood after being able to supply dhotis and saris to the government scheme, he said.Anbumani Ramadoss, a former Union health minister, said people queuing for free dhotis and other gifts each Pongal was not a pretty sight, wondering if this was the achievement of 50 years of Dravidian rule. Our policy, he said, will be to provide free services. Students will be provided free education, noon meal, books, notebooks and all other things they need. Healthcare will be provided on the lines of UKs National Health Service.The payment of interest on the high debt the state had incurred had become a major expense, he said. Pointing to the death toll due to Cyclone Gaja that ravaged the states central region earlier this month, he said most of the victims were hut-dwellers. Successive governments have not been able to provide them pucca houses, he said.The two Dravidian majors spend most of their time distributing freebies for the sake of votes, he said and blamed poor quality education for many engineers failing to land jobs and medical aspirants faring badly in NEET.Manuraj didnt agree and recalled how introduction of reservation for backward classes by the Justice Party in 1920 had brought helped bring thousands from these classes into the mainstream. If freebies make people lazy, he said, all those who receive doles in industrially advanced Scandinavian countries must be so. There is no research to show a welfare state leads to laziness."

Water shortage and the resultant bad crop conditions in some parts of the state may lead to a significant escalation of prices in the wholesale market, which will push the retail prices up as well.Already prices of rice varieties have gone up by 5% and they may go up further by 10%-15%, Dhaval Shah, the director of Jairaj Group in Market Yard, told TOI. There is a strong possibility that pulses like chana, tur, urad and moong may increase by Rs7-Rs10 in the wholesale market over the next 15-20 days, he said. Shah added the new rice varieties  produced during kharif  are usually cheaper than old rice varieties. But this time, the difference isnt significant. In some basmati varieties, the price of the new produce is higher. We expect the prices of new rice produce to further rise by 10-15%, he addedNitin Nahar, a wholesaler and the director of the Federation of Associations of Maharashtra , said prices of all types of pulses have increased by Rs 3 to Rs 6 in the last 15-20 days. The price rise has begun to translate into an increase in the retail prices as well, he said and added that produce coming into the wholesale market is from the recent kharif season, which saw 30% dip in production.The per kg retail price of urad dal, which was Rs64 during Darasa, has reached Rs72, said Hanuman Unecha , a retailer on SB Road. Prices may increase more, but that will depend on the demand and any new government policy, he said.Vijay Rathod, another wholesaler, said the prices may increase if the kharif supplies are in reduced quantities. If the government releases its stocks, then there might be no problem, he added."

I primarily grow rice and wheat. Almost everything was damaged this year.But it is just not poor prices of farm produce that affect the farmers. They are also worried over unemployment and malnutrition among their children.The government is serving the corporate interest and lands are being acquired in the state without consulting the gram sabhas. If agricultural land is taken away, what will be the other means of earning for the farmers? There wont be any yield from barren land, asserted Surjit Sinha, general secretary, Jharkhand Raj Kisan Sabha.

His colleagues, C Chandra Sekhar and KP Singh, who have managed to stay free in Addis Ababa, said the situation was very grim and they feared water supply would be snapped in the next few days. The seven employees are under ""house arrest"" and are not being allowed to venture out of their rooms, said one of their colleagues.Raghuvanshi, Sekhar and Singh are part of a group of 15 employees of a joint venture between IL&FS Transportation Networks and Spanish company Elsamex that is engaged in road construction.They are now facing the consequences of the mismanagement of former IL&FS chief Ravi Parthsarathy and his ousted team of executives. The Indian expats themselves have not been paid salaries for months, with some of the dues dating back to April.With funds drying up, the Ethiopian Roads Authority has terminated the contracts and there is a fear that the joint venture may leave behind unpaid dues.IL&FS Transportation Network was unable to pay salary to its 500-600 local staff in October and the dues for November, too, have piled up. The demand is for an immediate payment of around $300,000. ""But the problem will not stop there. Under local laws, the company has to offer severance packages for six months and there are unpaid dues of vendors,"" Chandra Sekhar, the country coordinator for ITNL Elsamex JV told TOI.What has compounded the problem is that even Ethiopian authorities are worried that the company may not clear its dues, creating distress in the African country as the local employees are very poor and depend solely on their salaries for survival.While the problem has been building up, the IL&FS management has refused to provide any help, alleged some of the employees taken hostage.

I then boiled it along with jaggery syrup and ghee till the wheat milk turned into a halwa and garnished it with cashew and almonds, Ms. Zeenath shared the recipe even as people in the vicinity scooped out large portions from the bowl on the table before she knew it.Even after a century, the melt-in-the-mouth dish has not lost its original flavour that continues to tantalise the senses of people with sweet tooth.Nagalakshmi combined prawns with chintakaya (raw tamarind) to create a perfect taste liked instantly by the two-member jury.

5ce6112be8e3fc56af4117bb,Destruction in the delta,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/destruction-in-the-delta/article25638775.ece,2018-12-01,"When T. Govindarajan, 51, began growing coconut saplings alongside the groundnut crop on his 1.5 acre plot in Orathanadu, Tamil Nadu, nearly two decades ago, he thought he was making a safe bet on his future. A decade later, as the tall trees completely replaced the groundnut crop, his portion of land, though not large, began to provide a stable income that allowed him to dream of better things for his family. I have two sons. One in class 11, and the other in class 6. Both go to a private school. Every other investment I have been able to make is thanks to this coconut plantation.Standing under a cloudy sky that now casts a forbidding pall over the Orathanadu region near Thanjavur district, Govindarajan can only look on helplessly as his coconut farm lies flattened. It was just another casualty of Cyclone Gaja which ripped through the delta districts of the State about 10 days ago.As farm hands work to clear away fallen leaves and tree trunks, he trades stories with other farmers whose plots adjoin his. They talk about B. Sunderraj, a farmer, who is said to have committed suicide over the loss of his coconut trees. And of the plight of N. Karunanidhi, also from their village, who was planning to sell an acre of his coconut farm in order to conduct a grand wedding for his daughter but can no longer do so. They speak with an anxiety about the future, and about the possibility of planting hybrid varieties of coconut saplings that would provide yields quicker. As they talk, they cannot help but acknowledge a grim reality  that they too are not safe from the agrarian distress that has affected paddy farmers in the region.Blown awayIn the deluge of reports about the destruction wreaked by Cyclone Gaja, there is one statistic that stands out, and is also viscerally evident  that it felled 60-80% of all coconut trees in the region. Initial estimates by the State government show that around 75 lakh coconut trees were damaged either fully or partially in the gale winds.Initially, Gaja was forecast to affect the area around Chennai and Puducherry, but made landfall further south on Tamil Nadus east coast, covering the districts along the States famous East Coast Road. The districts affected most severely include Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam. The last three make up what is known as Tamil Nadus delta region, encompassing the lower reaches of the Cauvery river. Of these, Nagapattinam, the worst affected, falls on the coast line, with Gaja making a direct line inward over Tiruvarur and Thanjavur. Famous for rice farming, these areas have also begun contributing up to a quarter of Indias total coconut production, with the highest yield per hectare.In field after field of coconut trees across these districts, which have been either uprooted or stand tilting dangerously, the same story repeats itself: of marginal and small farmers affected by changes in climate and weather patterns. It has been difficult for them. When the frequent failure of the monsoons forced them to diversify their crop patterns, recurring cyclones could threaten to blow all their work away.About 30 years ago, farmers from various towns in the region, including Pattukkottai, Thambikottai, Peravurani and Orathanur began the switch to coconut plantations. The move was prompted by uncertainty over the release of water from the Mettur dam following the dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over the sharing of Cauvery river water. In subsequent years, as rainfall patterns became more erratic, farmers with smaller holdings also wanted an alternative. Says V. Narayanaswamy, a schoolteacher who also started growing coconuts on his two acre plot some years ago, For many of us, apart from the water issue, paddy farming was just too labour intensive. Regardless of how much we made on the paddy, we could still end up with a loss after paying for the labour. Farmers in the region also took a collective decision: first to grow trees such as jackfruit and coconut along with the regular crop, and then to move into coconut farming wholesale.The States granaryThis region, famous for its fertile soil, has always been known as the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu. But the character of its landscape is changing as fields of green paddy now share space with an expanding number of groves and orchards. To go with the burgeoning coconut plantations, farmers in towns like Vedaranyam, Katipulam, Chembodai and Pushpavanam in Nagapattinam district were also expanding farms with fruit trees such as mango, cashew nut and tamarind. However, it was coconut that made the most economic sense. Unlike paddy crop, which provides a yield every six months and is water intensive, coconut trees, which are a perennial crop, provided fruit every two months. A raw coconut would fetch anything between Rs. 12 and Rs. 18, explains Narayanaswamy, with the husk being sold at Rs. 1 a piece and the shell also being sold separately. Though the soil in this region is a bit saline and despite being away from the coastal region, the coconuts thrived. Even for a farmer with about 1.5-2 acres of land, the trees would provide upward of 3,000 coconuts every two months, Narayanaswamy says.Despite the growing supply, there was never a shortage in demand. Quite the opposite, in fact. Earlier this year, it was reported that while the demand for copra (dried coconut kernels from which oil is obtained) was growing at nearly 8% per annum, the supply of copra had been growing at just 2%. All the farmers in Thanjavur district cite the company, Marico, which makes oil under the Parachute brand, as a regular buyer. A news report from earlier this year says that the company even stepped in to help farmers, bringing in agricultural experts to advise those whose trees were not yielding enough fruit either due to pest infestation or unscientific crop management.In contrast, the fortunes of paddy farmers have continued to fluctuate. Last year , for instance, was one of relative drought, with the Southwest and Northeast monsoons failing. There were crop failures in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts, and sporadic reports of farmers ending their lives. It is not hard to see why coconut farming is more attractive and appealing as a sustainable and profitable enterprise  a virtual failsafe. On the issue of cyclones, several farmers in the region say the idea of insuring their crop did not occur to them as they had never even imagined that a cyclone could cause so much damage.Those who still have vivid memories of the past recall the last major cyclone in the region, and one of a comparable magnitude  in 1952. Yet, the frequency is worrying. A report in the Down to Earth magazine says that Gaja has been the 10th major cyclone to affect Tamil Nadu in the past 16 years. The number of cyclones that hit the State between 1891 and 2002 was 54, which works out to 0.49 cyclones per year. Between 2003 and 2018, this went up to 0.63 per year, a rise of 30%.The States action plan for climate change identifies cyclones as a major concern. In the past two years alone, it has seen the effects of three devastating cyclones that have caused major losses to life, property and tree cover. These are Ockhi, which struck in Kanyakumari in June last year, Vardah, which hit Chennai in late 2016, and now Gaja. This is quite apart from the fact that the Tamil Nadu coast has always been one of the most cyclone-prone regions in the country. Back in 1968, in the Tamil blockbuster, Thillana Mohanambal, the heroines mother mentions the place name Nagapattinam. In response, Nagesh, the comedian, quips: Is a cyclone coming?Waiting for reliefDespite the region being cyclone-prone, the State government has hardly taken note of the fact that most houses in the villages of Nagapattinam, Thanjavur and Tiruvarur are thatched roof structures. Landless labourers make up about 31% of the population of these districts, and are the worst hit in times of both drought and cyclones. This is one of the few regions in Tamil Nadu which has remained predominantly agrarian. It has not seen the expansion of industry or the trend of land being sold for real estate. Those old enough to remember the cyclone of 1952 recall similar destruction, but not much seems to have changed since then.In the immediate aftermath of Gaja, officials admit that the extent of damage has been beyond their comprehension. This despite their having taken active measures to establish emergency control centres in six coastal districts. Gagandeep Singh Bedi, an official in charge of rehabilitation in Thanjavur district, says the damage to property and infrastructure is 10 times more than what was caused by Cyclone Thane, which had hit the eastern coast along Puducherry and Cuddalore in 2011. At that time, Thane had become a reference point for disaster management officials, who had to contend with the loss of tree cover and destruction of numerous electrical posts and transmitters. If the overall damage to property in the delta districts is significantly worse, a big element of this is the destruction of virtually every thatched roof structure in these villages.Two weeks after Gaja hit, people are still camped out in temporary shelters, all along the main roads in Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur, waiting for relief materials to be handed out. These camps, each comprising 20 to 30 people, display signs that announce their having been affected by Cyclone Gaja and in need of assistance.Many of them use the relief rations to cook food for people in the village. They are able to manage just one meal a day. The damage caused to the power supply means that there is no drinking water in many of these villages.In several villages, for example, Rayanallur Katakam near Tiruvarur, most residents have had to sleep in some of the concrete structures that have escaped damage. In most of the houses, the roofs have either collapsed or the floors are too damp with heavy rains continuing in the area. In almost every camp, villagers say that relief workers travel along the main roads, refusing to move inside the villages and judge the extent of damage to the smaller houses.In its report to the Centre detailing the damage caused by Gaja, the Tamil Nadu government has estimated the number of people rendered homeless to be 3.7 lakh, and houses destroyed at 3.4 lakh. The State has submitted a memorandum to the Centre seeking about Rs. 15,000 crore for restoration, rehabilitation and mitigation, and another Rs. 1,431 crore for immediate relief work. These funds are imperative in order to re-establish a basic framework of normality  getting people back to their homes and restoring the supply of drinking water and electricity.Across the cyclone-affected areas, perhaps the only sight as common as fallen coconut trees are damaged electrical transformers. According to figures available with the State government, the cyclone has damaged 201 power substations, upended 886 transformers, and snapped 53,21,506 electricity connections.The Central government has sanctioned Rs. 200 crore to overhaul power networks in the region. Nearly 25,000 workers of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) are on the job. Trucks with teams of electrical workers are a common sight now across districts in the delta region. They are often accompanied by large truckloads of concrete pillars (to reconnect the wires) that have come in from neighbouring Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Cyclone Gaja has so far claimed over 40 lives, but the toll could have been much worse had it not been for the early evacuation of 2.5 lakh people. Given the extent of damage to property, it is clear that the State needs to come up with a more comprehensive disaster preparedness plan. This should start, first of all, with the rebuilding of houses to make them more weather-resistant. A step in this direction was taken when Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced on November 29 his governments decision to build one lakh concrete houses for those who had lost their huts in the cyclone. This is a start, but much more needs to be done.He also announced that relief materials such as rice, oil and clothing would reach those would have been affected within the next five days. So far, however, the distribution of relief materials has been sporadic at best, with some in the camps claiming that they get daily rations of rice, while others in the interior areas saying that they have to wait for hours just to receive even a couple of biscuit packets.Question of compensationThere is also the larger question of damage to farm property and how the region will move forward. While paddy crop remains a huge risk, given the erratic monsoons, they can nonetheless be sown again the next year if affected by unseasonal weather. Coconut saplings, on the other hand, will need about seven or eight years to take full root and start providing a harvest. Most farmers in the region are still unclear about the level of compensation that the State government will offer for their crop.The coconut producers union in Thanjavur says that it has asked the Coconut Development Board to raise the issue with the Union Agriculture Ministry and seek compensation to the fullest possible. The union says that the damage to coconut trees as estimated by the State government is about Rs. 3,000 crore. While farmers want between relief of Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 25,000 per coconut tree, petitions are being filed in district courts that seek an amount of up to Rs. 50,000 per tree. In neighbouring Nagapattinam, mango farmers, who claim that each tree used to yield a tonne of mangos in a year, are likely to demand more.Going forward, crop insurance is likely to be a key factor in encouraging farmers to rebuild all that they have lost. Unfortunately, there is very little awareness about this except among paddy farmers who are more accustomed to the process of filing for insurance.According to the Pudukkottai MLA, N. Rangarajan, who is also a farmer, the issue is being studied. There are loan schemes for coconut crops from the Coconut Development Board and under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance scheme), which has a coconut palm insurance scheme. Both offer very low amounts as compensation, he says and farmers in the region are looking at alternatives.Rangarajan adds that he plans to encourage farmers to go in for cashewnut crop instead of coconut as they have low-lying branches and less likely to be affected by strong winds. For the regions near the coast, however, there is no choice but to opt for coconut again despite the risk of another cyclone, he says, as the soil type is best suited for coconut farming.Institutes such as the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, which had initially advised and helped many of the farmers to switch to coconut farming, can also play a role in offering help and advice, he adds.For the regions near the coast, there is no choice but to opt for coconut again despite the risk of another cyclone.N.

I have no insurance or compensation, said the farmer, who grows rice, cotton and cashew on his two-acre land. However, Apparao is not in Delhi to complain about his personal disaster.Scale of disasterAs he marched from Nizamuddin toward Ramlila Maidan on Thursday along with thousands of other farmers in preparation for Fridays Kisan Mukti March, he detailed the scale of the disaster that has overtaken adivasi farmers in his district.Over the last 10 years, I know of some 40 to 50 farmers who have died by suicide because of increasing loans. I have come to Delhi to speak for my people and demand some relief, he said.His daughter Sandhya, who marched alongside carrying the green flag of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, has just completed Class XII.She would like to attend college but knows that her family cannot afford that right now, especially given the recent cyclone losses. There are some loans and jobs supposed to be available through the State tribal development corporation but like many adivasis in the district she is struggling to get the certificate that will enable her to benefit from the scheme.As the marchers made a pit stop near Raj Ghat, volunteers from Nation for Farmers handed out water packets and sweet buns.

On the Ministers report, Mr. Kejriwal ordered the suspension of the Commissioner, sending the file to Mr. Baijal, as matters of services are under the L-Gs control.Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, AAP national spokesperson Dilip Pandey said even 24 hours after the Chief Ministers order, the L-G has not acted against the official.

It is here that the half-burnt bodies of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were cremated on the banks of Satluj river on March 23, 1931, after they were executed at Central Jail, Lahore. The area across the Satluj is topographically close to Pakistan.Retired bureaucrat Kulbir Singh Sidhu, who has served as deputy commissioner and divisional commissioner of Ferozepur, said Hussainiwala was an important route for trade and transit in Punjab, and should be opened with mutual understanding. It is also an emotional chord between people on both sides of the border, especially for those residing nearby, he said.Historian Rakesh Kumar said the Hussainiwala-Ganda Singh Wala border had immense social and economic value. People in Indian and Pakistan will welcome efforts to open it, he said.Punjab Cotton Factories and Ginners Association former president Bhagwan Bansal said the opening of the Hussainiwala trade route would be of immense benefit to both countries. Hussainiwala is part of Malwa region, which is also cotton belt. Cotton, yarn and basmati rice could be exported through the Hussainiwala border, he said.All India Combine Manufacturers Association general secretary Amar Singh said combines could be exported to Pakistan through Hussainiwala, and those would help Pakistan farmers save money.Before he unfurled the national flag in Ferozepur on Independence Day last year, Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had stressed on the need to reopen the border route. At the time, he had said that a strong case should be made for reopening the Hussainiwala border for trade between India and Pakistan, as was the case before the 1971 war.Before this, former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had echoed similar sentiments in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to Hussainiwala on March 23, 2015, to pay tributes to freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev."

The officials sealed the stock of 50 tonne of edible oil worth Rs 42.92 lakh.The unit owner used to purchase cheaper edible oils in bulk and would do the branding, labelling and packaging at his unit located at Dangde Farm in Pisoli (Haveli taluka). When we raided the unit, we found large tanks of cheaper edible oils and mustard oils, Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner (food), FDA, Pune told TOI.The owner was also found operating the unit without oil testing laboratory, which is mandatory. Besides, the person in-charge of the operation at the unit was not technically qualified. The edible oil packaging unit needs to test the oil periodically and maintain a record of the same. But there was no laboratory on the premises. We have also drawn samples of the oil and sent them for tests to the government laboratory. Deshmukh said.The officials found that the packaging unit was selling adulterated oil when a sample drawn randomly during Diwali showed the adulteration. The officials then raided the unit late on Thursday night. FDA food safety officials Ulhas Ingawale, Santosh Sawant, Anil Gavate carried out the raid under the guidance of state FDA minister Girish Bapat.Incidentally, the FDAs vigilance department had raided several oil mills in the past, taken samples and found packets of sunflower, soybean, groundnut oil refilled with cotton seed oil. There are instances where miscreants removed oil from tins of reputed brands and mixed it with ordinary palm oil or any other cheap variety of oil, said another official.According to experts, such impurities are difficult to identify as the blending of cheaper oil like palm oil does not change the physical property or taste of the product. But it changes the chemical property, which affects the consumers health."

He is hopeful of heading there next summer and immersing himself in the citys sustainable and inventive approach to food.The head chef at Mumbais Olive Bar & Kitchen is on a mission to change the way people consume food and if his new menu is anything to go by, its a change we welcome with open arms and loosened belts.Backyard goodiesIn November, the iconic Mediterranean fine-dine in Bandra, Olive, celebrated its 18th anniversary. On offer are a new cocktail, and food menu. Not many may know that the restaurant has its own back garden; it flooded in the monsoon but is now blooming. It is here that bar manager John Leese seeks herbs and inspiration for a cocktail menu that aims to highlight agave spirits. The Garden of Eden (Rs. 630) has gin shaken with a lychee puree, with lemongrass and ginger adding fragrance and heat. The drink starts out bitter and then mellows down to a smooth sweetness; with basil oil adding depth. Tommys Margherita (Rs. 750) has agave nectar and El Jimador Blanco tequila and a sharp drink with citrus notes.In-house creationsThe drinks are respectable but its Olives food that makes the strongest impression. Sachdeva believes in treating ingredients and produce with respect and showcasing them to the fullest. Theres emphasis on organic and locally sourced fare (from across India), and reduced wastage. Everything that cannot be sourced locally is made in-house, including bread, butter, sauces, spreads, ferments, pickles and sausages. Earlier we did a lot of fruit and vegetables ferments. Now, we are pushing the boundaries using grain and wheat and fish, says Sachdeva. Its easier and simpler this way; we dont want to rely on cans. It makes for food that is inventive and indulgent.Take the Tuna Jerky (Rs. 525), richer and more nuanced than any meat jerky. Sachdeva takes fresh, local tuna and smokes it slowly till it dries up and intensifies in flavour. The jerkys saltiness is softened by crushed potatoes and smoked ketchup. A Red Velvet Fried Chicken 2.0 (Rs. 525) dunks chicken in a batter of cake crumbs and buttermilk and fries it till golden and moist and dusts it with red velvet crumbs. Its finger lickin good. The no-waste Sweet Corn Gnocchi (Rs. 375) is a Sachdeva favourite. It uses every part of the corn: cob and kernels become a puree, kernels turn into gnocchi, husk is fermented and added to puree, and some of the husk is used to smoke the accompanying cabbage hearts. All the trimmings from the corn and other vegetables go into a vegetarian XO sauce, smoky on the tongue and caramel in colour.Comfort foodThose with a dairy turn of mind will be delighted with the cheese on offer, sourced from different farms across India and some made in-house. Homemade stringy cheese is stuffed in rice balls, drizzled with truffle oil and served as a Mushroom and Truffle Arancini (Rs. 375). Its crisp, gooey and earthy. The Baked Brie & Truffle (Rs. 450) is stunning  truffle brie is paired with mascarpone and heaps of parmesan shavings, served on house-made raisin bread. Its a mouthful of umami, warm and creamy brie playing with the slight sweetness of the crunchy bread. Its a dish that shows off technique, has locally sourced ingredients and it serves as delicate comfort food. Theres homemade ricotta, crumbly and heavy pairs with smoky roasted sweet potatoes (Rs. 395); stringy burrata with fresh, sweet tomatoes (Burrata and Heirloom Tomatoes, Rs. 395) and chilled goats cheese with fresh figs and quinoa (Figs and Goat Cheese, Rs. 395).To round-off the meal is the Vodka Milk Panna Cotta (Rs. 450). Vodka added to milk helps the resultant ice cream set on its own. This intense combination is offset by a plain vanilla panna cotta, a berry puree for some sourness, and apple granite (with cucumber juice); theres white chocolate too, but it makes the whole dish too heavy.The menu will see a few additions over the next few months. Sachdevas homemade duck sausage, which sold out in a week is curing; and a new batch is expected in December. A spoiled can of expensive anchovies eventually led him to can his own fish so now mackerel bones and heads are being cured to make an intense oil. Expect many such experiments in the future, asserts Sachdeva.Olive, Khar (W); phone: 43408229, open from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. (Monday to Sunday) and 12.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m. (Saturday and Sunday)"

Likewise, Rajendran, Ravi, Soundaram and Kartik, all from Salem, died on the fateful day when the cyclonic rain hit the town and Karuppasami and Murugan of Oddanchatram died in a tree fall in their locality.The minister gave away cheques to the family members of Nileema, Karuppasami and Murugan and informed that the Salem district administration would give away the compensation to the families of Rajendran, Ravi, Soundaram and Karthik in their town.Speaking to reporters, he said that the Central team, which visited the delta districts were briefed about the scenario in Dindigul district. We have sought Rs. 250 crore from the Centre, he noted.Apart from loss of seven lives, the district lost 27 cattle. Over 3000 dwellings were damaged (fully and partially). During the rain, the survey revealed that 1098 high tension electric poles, 4096 low tension poles were uprooted. Similarly, tree numbering close to 1900 were uprooted. About 9000 hectares of crops including horticulture were damaged.

N. Jothimani, at 63, is still working in a fireworks unit, as hundreds of senior citizens are employed in cracker units for their hand-to-mouth existence. But Jothimanis case is different, for he had a close shave during one of the worst fire accidents on September 5, 2012.An employee of the ill-fated Om Sakthi Fireworks in Muthalipatti near Sivakasi, Jothimani had been to the CPI (M) office for some work. I had just reached the main gate when the second explosion took place and at least 41 persons were killed. I stood witness to those gory deaths, he recalls. After six years, Jothimani, his wife, daughter, son-in-law and son are employed in the same industry.P. Rakkammal, 63, of Murugan Colony goes to work to take care of her aged husband. All my three children and their families could not take care of our needs, she complains. She makes Rs. 150 a day. With the fireworks units closed now, she says the aged couple should make do with the 20-kg free rice distributed through ration shops.But things are different for P. Kaleeswari, 34, a single mother. Only if I work for all 30 days a month, I can run my family. She has to spend a minimum of Rs. 100 for transport and other expenses of her three children who are in school and college. Forty-two-year-old K. Sadachiammal, who has been making fireworks since young age, returned to Sivakasi within a few years of marriage with Karuppasamy in a different village. Working in farm land did not fetch the couple enough money to run the family with two children. Now, my husband and two sons (both married) are also into making crackers, she says with pride. She earns anything between Rs. 300 and 400 a day. The advantage of working to earn at piece rate is the flexible working time so that she can take care of daily chores at home.A. Akila, 33, who makes flower pots, does not see any another alternative employment. With class 5 as qualification, what job can I find at this stage? Let the government close down the industry after providing us jobs. What shall we do to bring up our children without any job, she asks.M. Mahalakshmi, general secretary of Virudhunagar District Fireworks and Matches Workers Association, concurs with Akila. Workers get handsome advance from factory owners around this time. The advance of Rs. 3000 to Rs. 20,000 per worker will take care of school/college fees and repayment of loans, she says.But, in the given jobless situation, workers and their families suffer. The State government should give Rs. 5,000 a month to every family that has lost jobs on the same lines as compensation to farmers for crop loss and fishermen for fishing ban period. Otherwise, the workers will be trapped in debt, she says.The worst part of the workers plight, according to Jothimani, is that even grocery shops and milk vendors would not offer the usual credit after Deepavali till puja for resumption of work is performed at factories. Otherwise, how will the poor shopkeeper feed his family, he asks.Last year, when the industry was closed for 28 days protesting against imposition of 28% GST, centres were opened to distribute free gruel for workers and their families. The hapless workers were also harassed by usury money lenders then for non-repayment of loans."

She continued, What is smog ? How can you stay safe from bad air? The class continued for 45 minutes, at the end of which she displayed different plants known to purify air that one can put up at home.Twenty students in the class of 11-year-olds sat in rapt attention, naming stubble burning, cars and crackers as the prime causes of bad air when asked.The teacher, Soniya Nagpal, explained, When the rice harvest is over, farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Western UP burn crop stubble, which is a leading cause of smog in our air. She added this was the third year running when air pollution in the NCR had become intolerable. When she finished speaking, students bombarded her with questions. When will this end? What can we do to ensure we breathe healthy? With patience, Nagpal replied: Wear masks when you go out. Maintain plants that purify air at home, as not everyone can afford air purifiers.City schools are holding special classes to teach students about smog, pollution, stubble burning, AQI PM 2.5 , etc. Schools said the impact of these classes has been phenomenon, as students are eager to know how to deal with the problem.Sudha Goyal, director, The Scottish High School, said: Every day, in the zero period before school starts, we teach students about changes in atmosphere. Teachers explain kids what is smog or AQI level, and why we need to monitor it. Pollution classes shouldnt be part of the curriculum, otherwise students will approach it by rote. This is something which all of us should know.In one school, a red flag is placed on the field and AQI readings are updated daily outside every classroom. The school regularly hosts informative sessions to spread awareness about the pollution menace among students. Y K Sindwani, the head of Lancers International School, said: We regularly teach students about air quality. Daily monitoring of air also helps us modify plans for our outdoor activities.Other schools have even begun sending notifications to parents on why they should know all about air quality along with their kids. We sent notifications to parents that were on pollution, and on why students should be taught about it, said Goyal of Scottish High.Alka Saxena, deputy director (health and wellness), Blue Bells Group of Schools, said: Weve distributed a circular among students on how to be safe during the winter smog, and the need to abstain from the outdoors especially in the morning and evening hours. In the morning assembly, we regularly advise students to wear masks when stepping out. Along with vertical gardens inside the school, a green belt has been created around the school, in which over 500 plants have been planted.Vaibhav Kapoor, principal, Ajanta Public School, said: We sent a circular, telling our students and their parents to avoid artificial or electric gadgets, and to maintain plants that purify air instead. Arti Chopra, principal, Amity International School, Sector 46, concurred, saying, Weve spoken about rising pollution at the morning assembly.Another institution is holding seminars on the topic. P K Samal, director, Discovery Montessori Preschool, said: Weve conducted seminars with students on which masks they should wear, why stubble burning is bad, how we need to stop burning garbage and ways in which pollution can be brought down.Where state authorities often appear clueless about the rising menace, the can-do spirit of Millennium City has awoken to take up the slack."

The kitchen is an extension of the dormitory where the students keep trunk boxes. Foul smell emanating from toilets behind the classrooms speaks volumes about the plight of the students.This is the situation at Balayogi Gurukulam at Adavitakkellapadu on the premises of Dakshinya Educational Society, one of the 16 schools run by the Andhra Pradesh Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (APSWREIS) in the district. Of these, five schools, one at Kakumanu, Tadikonda, Yadlapadu, boys school in Sattenapalli and the one in Guntur are being run from make-shift compounds. There are 180 such institutions in the State.The arrangement will continue till construction of new buildings is completed.In Guntur, former SW Minister Ravela Kishore established a school on the premises of Dakshinya School for Differently Abled. The government pays Rs. 54,000 for six rooms with a kitchen.For the inmates, coming from underprivileged sections, the lack of amenities has come as a rude shock.Some of my classmates sleep on trunk boxes as we dont have space in the rooms. The classrooms are small and during nights, mosquitoes swarm the rooms, says a student from Kaza village.Cut in grantThe APSEWREIS is not helping the cause either by scaling down the maintenance grant from Rs. 40,000 to just Rs. 15,000.As tenders for the catering agency and sanitation have not been finalised, the schools are forced to put up with the temporary arrangement.The State Government spends Rs. 28 on food for every student per day, but the students end up getting a recipe of sambar and rice every day.The APSEWREIS spends crores every year to send students of SW schools to Mount Everest or organises mega events to get into the Guinness Book of Records, but spends little on providing basic amenities, said a senior teacher."

In view of the request from the millers to extend some grace time, the government has decided to waive the penalty if the dues were cleared immediately.Addressing the media at Secretariat on Tuesday, Civil Supplies Minister Prathipati Pulla Rao said that 45 millers in the State failed to clear the dues despite repeated reminders and other legal actions, including arrest and seizure of the mills.

The State goes to the polls on Wednesday.The BJP is hoping for a straight fourth term in a State that has traditionally been a stronghold of the Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliates. But the Congress is banking on an anti-incumbency mood due to 15 years of uninterrupted BJP rule.Welfare politicsThe BJP is heavily depending on welfare schemes to deliver the goods. Schemes such as Lakshmi Ladli that provide financial assistance to a girl child up to the age of 21, free pilgrimage for senior citizens from economically weaker families and rice and wheat at Rs. 1 a kg to BPL families are popular in rural and semi-rural families that make up nearly 70% of the States electorate.For the BJP, a robust grassroots organisation, support from the Sangh in mobilising voters and the continued popularity of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan are the positives. But there is visible anger and an anti-incumbency mood against sitting MLAs. To counter this, the party dropped 47 MLAs and replaced them with new faces. But that has created a large number of rebels who may eat into the BJPs votes. And unlike the 2013 Assembly polls when the BJP was riding a wave after it announced Narendra Modi as its prime ministerial nominee, there is no visible wave.People of Madhya Pradesh had decided that they will negate this time Modi ji [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] and Shivraj Singh Chouhan ji . They have seen through the veil and seen what the BJP is all about, trying to dupe people and giving out false promises. This time, there will be no Modi ji or Shivraj Singh ji magic, Congress campaign chief Jyotiraditya Scindia earlier told The Hindu .The Congresss campaign revolved around issues such as agrarian distress, joblessness, price rise, alleged scams such as Vyapam and law and order, especially crimes against women. And the Mandsaur firing of June 6 last year that claimed the lives of six farmers was the turning point in the partys aggressive farmers outreach.Loan waiverParty chief Rahul Gandhi promised farmers a loan waiver within 10 days of the party coming to power.If he dithers, the Chief Minister would be changed ... The farmers in the State, for the first time in 15 years, will feel that they are in power, Mr. Gandhi said at a rally in Ujjain earlier this month.However, the Congresss failure to stitch together an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Gondwana Gantantra Party could prove to be a big setback. In 2013, though the BJP won 164 of the 230 seats and the Congress 58, the difference in vote share between the two parties was 8.32%.Adding the BSPs 6.29% vote share, Congress leaders said their seats could have gone closer to the three-figure mark.The stakes are high for the BJP as winning in the Hindi heartland will build a momentum for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by demoralising the Opposition camp. The party can also hope to corner the 29 Lok Sabha seats from the State, the reason Prime Minister Modi gave an extra push to his partys efforts in the last few days of campaigning.Accusing the Congress of dragging his mothers name into the campaign (Congress MP Raj Babbar had referred to her), the Prime Minister hit back at a public meeting in Chatarpur on Saturday. The people in the Congress, you do not have the strength to fight Modi. In the last 17-18 years, I have challenged you at every instance and defeated you. And you are dragging my mother into politics, he asked."

Drinking water was unavailable in many hamlets and people were forced to consume nonpotable water, she told reporters in Kodaikanal.Accompanied by party functionaries and her brother Sudeesh, she gave sarees, rice and biscuits and other essential items to women and children camping in temporary shelters in Moonjikal, Pudukadu, Kallaraimedu and Dobikana respectively.When asked about the Central assistance for cyclone-hit districts, she said, let the State government first give its promised Rs. 1,000 crore to the victims and then ask for assistance from the Union government.Expressing her anguish over the nonchalant attitude of the official machinery, she said that people were not only upset, but frustrated due to the lackadaisical approach of the officials. The party functionaries told her that the ghat road to Kodaikanal from the plains was still dangerous to drive as the PWD and highways engineers had not taken any permanent measures to strengthen the stretches which had been damaged in the landslide. She hoped the officials acted fast and ensured that people were safe in the hill station."

When the heroines mother mentions Nagapattinam, Nagesh, the comedian, says: Is a cyclone arriving? That donkey comes every year anyway!For a music lover and cultural enthusiast, the composite Thanjavur district, now trifurcated into Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, always conjures up images of great composers, musicians, dancers, bronze idols, and majestic temples built by kings, particularly the Cholas. The writings of T. Janakiraman, which capture the cultural milieu of Thanjavur, further strengthen my bond with these districts. I have visited these districts several times for stories on musicians, musical instruments, bronze statues and temples, and occasionally to report on an agrarian crisis.Cyclone Gaja, which has ravaged Nagapattinam and parts of Thanjavur and Tiruvarur, painted a different picture of these districts for me. I forgot all about temples and music when I travelled the length and breadth of these districts.It looks as if the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu is being transformed into a drought-hit area, with its great past being buried in the process.The cyclone has changed the lives of the people there forever. The poor are left with nothing, and the middle class and the rich have become poor. Villages and towns look like the sets of a Hollywood war film. Only concrete structures have survived; huts and tiled roof houses are beyond repair. Electric posts and cell phone towers lie twisted. Not a single electric post has been left untouched by the speeding winds. It may take at least a month to fully restore power supply. Sea water has spoilt the groundwater in the area. The delta region has been left without drinking water and is now dependent on water supply from tankers.People have been put up in camps or in temporarily created structures at the entrance of their villages, which are connected to the main road. This draws the attention of those distributing relief material. When I visited, I saw many of the affected stopping vehicles and pleading for help. When they came across media vehicles, they requested journalists to visit their villages so that the extent of the damage could be reported and could reach the ears of the administration.The bird sanctuary in Point Calimere (Kodiyakarai in Tamil) looked like an area that had suffered heavy aerial bombing. While many birds have deserted the sanctuary, thousands have died. The trees there looked bald without their canopy. It may take months for them to look alive.At the entrance of Point Calimere stands the temple of Kodiyakarai Kuzhagar, which has been sung about by the Shaivite saint Sundaramoorthy Nayanar. Writer Kalki, in his novel Ponniyin Selvan, describes the temple in such a captivating way that I have always wanted to visit it. In a hymn, Nayanar wonders why Lord Shiva prefers to stay in a forest when there are so many places where large numbers of devotees can visit regularly. Nayanar curses himself for seeing such the pathetic sight of the Lord in the forest. I cursed the cruelty of the cyclone and left the place without visiting the temple."

Residents say that though they have seen the area evolve and accommodate large villa type houses, the lack of common civic amenities is tangible.Uthangudi, a recently added ward of the Madurai Corporation, has a population of 22,240 according to Census 2011. K. Chandralekha, a resident for many years, is sure that this number has exponentially grown since.Ever since the construction of the Ring Road and the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, several people began flocking to Uthangudi. They also realised that the area had sufficient water supply thanks to the Uthangudi channel that runs through it. This was enough reason to move, she says.Living in Pandi Koil Street, Ms. Chandralekha says that despite this population explosion, there is high disparity in the ward. While areas like Valar Nagar and adjoining places have tar roads and door-to-door waste collection, those like Pandi Koil Street, Muslim Street, K. M. College Street, Rice Mill Street and several others do not have proper roads.H. Latha, a resident, says that one of the primary problems the area faces is lack of street lights, We can hardly see any vehicles approaching us at night time. It feels unsafe to walk along this stretch, particularly if you are a woman. Chain snatching is very common here, she says. She adds that though the Corporation has constructed 10 to 15 individual household toilets in her area there is a definite necessity for other amenities. People from at least 30 households do not have toilets. Unless a common bathroom-cum-toilet is built, open defecation will continue along the bunds of the channel, she says.There is no underground drainage across ward 28 and residents feel that this is a major cause for the prevalence of vector-borne diseases. There are at least 4,000 households in Uthangudi that do not receive water supply from the local body. Most people are dependant on their bore wells and only 1,151 houses receive supply through pipelines, says a Corporation official. Empty or vacant house site plots in the ward have become dumping ground for waste as waste collection extends only to some parts. Many residents of Uthangudi are conservancy workers of the Corporation. They say that since road condition is poor, they are unable to drive their tricycles into the ward. Hence, letting people dump their waste in empty plots.Uthangudi is home to one of Corporations newest shelters for the urban homeless. It has two community halls, four free toilets and a total of 14 over head tanks. There are 135 streets with few civic amenities.P. Raamakrishnan, a resident, says that if the Corporation could improve the number of street lights, it would be of use to the public. It would also be great if the Corporation constructs underground drainage, he says.An official from the local body says that since Uthangudi is an added ward, the Corporation has already made allocations to provide basic amenities. We are waiting for the monsoon to get over so that other works in the area can be completed, he says."

Sanjay K JhaInterviews are sometimes cut short because some questions make those interviewed uncomfortable.The roles were reversed at Khasrod village in Madhya Pradeshs Raisen district, around 50km from Bhopal.Questions about the so-called national issues  the temple, the tallest statue, the quality of the political discourse, the distortion of history  burst the dam on the everyday challenges.The flood that cascaded down centred on one issue: lack of employment opportunities in spite of some families breaking centuries-old barriers and sending out their children to study.So much so that eventually, almost every national question was met with an instance of how an educated sister is stuck at home and how a graduate son found out that farm labour pays better than a private company. The narrations ended with an appeal: Please write about the need to create jobs.The interview ended abruptly because every question was triggering traumatic accounts of lives spent in the hope that the system will deliver if the citizens fulfil their part.Rajkumar Uike, a tribal youth living in the village, had agreed to speak to The Telegraph on one condition that itself spoke volumes about what matters: the questions should be limited to the problems he faced as a farmhand.Rajkumars little home falls in the Bhojpur Assembly constituency, named after Raja Bhoj, one of the most celebrated Indian kings who ruled Malwa and was known for patronising the arts and science in the 11th century.This newspaper could not verify some of the specific information listed by Rajkumar as officials are busy with preparations for Wednesdays elections. But signs of abject poverty were visible everywhere and there was little reason to doubt the young man.Excerpts from the unfinished interview follow:Q: You are a farmer?Rajkumar: No, farm labourer. I look after somebodys farm.Q: How much do you earn in a month?Rajkumar: (Smiles and gives a blank look. Wretched poverty displayed all over, on clothes, on the hut, on the utensils.)Q: What are the problems you face in looking after the farm?Rajkumar: DAP (fertiliser) price is up. Electricity comes from 2.30 at night to 6 in the morning. I have to wake up at night to start the pump. We want electricity from 10am to 6pm.Q: But the chief minister says 24-hour power supply is ensured.Rajkumar: For 24-hour supply, they charge Rs 32,000 for four months. We pay Rs 15,000 for four months.Q: You get the MSP decided by the government for your produce?Rajkumar: Got Rs 1,750 for wheat, MSP is Rs 1,840.Q: Got money for building a house?Rajkumar: No, nobody got it in our village. Only one house under the PM Awas Yojana, nobody under the state scheme. Officers say no scheme for your village.Q: But you didnt follow it up?Rajkumar: Officers dont listen. So many documents they ask for. Even in banks, Aadhaar has become another problem. Chappal toot jate chakkar lagate (the footwear gets worn out, going around in circles).Q: But Modiji says he opened bank accounts for the poor.Rajkumar: Anybody who had money could have opened an account anyway. Whats the benefit of a zero balance account?Q: But you are at least allowed to enter banks.Rajkumar: (Points to another person who had just arrived.) Ask him if the accounts could be opened earlier. He is Harlal Gaur, a big farmer.Harlal: I opened my account 30 years ago. Earlier, you had to fill up one slip, now they torture you by asking for endless sets of documents.Q: Did you get fasal bima (crop insurance) benefits?Rajkumar: Not one paisa. Neighbouring villages Ashapur and Nimkheda got it. Here we dont have good quality dhan (paddy) but they put us in that category. Our dhan was bad but we didnt get anything. Nothing for wheat.Q: Did you benefit from the Ladli scheme for daughters?Rajkumar: Nobody so far. They registered girl children but they will get Rs 1 lakh only when she passes Class VII after reaching the age of 18 years. Over 80 per cent of girls drop out after fifth or sixth as there are no schools in the village. A few who will get will have to wait till they turn 18.Q: But you get wheat and rice for Re 1 a kg?Rajkumar: Yes, I do.Harlal: I dont, only BPL cardholders do.Q: Will the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government come back?Rajkumar: (Silence)Harlal: No way.Q: So, do you feel proud Modiji enhanced the prestige of the country in the world?Rajkumar: There are no jobs. It is becoming a big problem.Q: But you got the biggest statue of Sardar Patel worth Rs 3,000 crore.Rajkumar: I am a BCom (graduate). Private companies give Rs 6,000 a month. Thats why I chose to be a farm labourer.Q: Arent you proud Hindu leaders are in control now?Rajkumar: My sister is also a BCom (graduate). We studied in Obaidullahganj (the nearest town, 8km away).Harlal: My two sons did MCom from Bhopal. Both are sitting at home. Should I call them?(The floodgates open. Several people start recounting their plight.)Rajkumar stepped out of his home to remind the reporter: Write something about employment creation. Thats the main issue.His sister, the commerce graduate who assists him in farming and looking after the cow, was peeping from behind a curtain. She belongs to a rare tribal family that cared to educate its children despite facing extreme social and financial difficulties in this remote village.On the day the interview was conducted last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in the state explaining how Rahul Gandhi and Kamal Nath were seeking Muslim votes. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath was also campaigning here, saying the Congress needed Ali not Bajrangbali."

Prem said this during Javik Dhan Katni Mahotsav, an event organised by city-based organisation Tarumitra, which saw schools and colleges harvesting paddy on a two-acre land of Tarumitra on its Digha campus. Prem, too, joined in harvesting paddy with the students.Students from Don Bosco Academy, Gulzarbagh Government Womens College, Baldwin Academy, Adarsh Bal Vidyalaya, May Flower School, SR Vidyapeeth, St Gabriels International School, Shanti Kutir, Disha Rehabilitation Centre, along with several educationists, dignitaries and social activists of the city participated in the event.Sharing tidbits about him being involved in organic farming, Prem said: For the past 10 years, fruits and vegetables are being grown organically at my official residence. Today, we dont get fruits or vegetables free of pesticides and chemicals. So, I decided to grow everything organically.The minister also performed aarti at the farm and led the procession of students for the dhan katni ceremony (paddy harvesting festival). The students had their share of fun because for many it was the first time entering a farm and harvesting with a sickle.Tarumitras-founder-cum-director Father Robert Athickal said the rice paddy that was harvested by students and the minister was a rare one called Kunjunj from Kerala.This variety does not require much water unlike traditional varieties and the plant gets flower by the end of 49 days. While earlier the monsoon used to set in the state by June-July, now the monsoon enters only around August and people can cultivate paddy only in December. That means, the whole procedure gets delayed because of late arrival of monsoon. At least two varieties of paddy can be grown in case we opt to grow these rare varieties of paddy. This suits our rain-deficient state, said Father Athickal."

This comes at a time when farm loan repayment has dipped by 10% as farmers seem to be in wait-and-watch mode.Paddy procurement in MP began on November 15, but the response has been dismal, admit officials. According to government sources, about 71,000 metric tonnes of paddy had come into mandis by November 26 last year. This year, its a mere 11,000 metric tonnes, they said.Paddy is procured by two agencies in MP  marketing federation and MP civil supplies corporation. The buzz in mandis is that farmers are waiting for the next government to be installed. Anil Yadav of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, Those who have sold their crop in mandis were the needy ones, who had to repay loans urgently.These days, payment for paddy procurement goes directly into farmers cooperative bank accounts, and loan repayment deduction is automatic as well. Farmers told TOI if they sell their crop now, they will lose a chunk of the money in loan repayments as EMI will automatically get deducted. Farmer Bisahulal Mahule in Balaghat, known as MPs rice bowl, said: In case of transfer of power, I will have more money in my account.The bureaucracy is tight-lipped. However, a senior official agreed to speak on condition of anonymity and said, Yes, there has been decline in paddy arrival. It could be because of the Congress announcement. Farmers feel that if they delay selling their produce in mandis, they will save a lot, otherwise their loan repayment will be deducted from their paddy proceeds.In poll-bound Chhattisgarh, too, paddy procurement is down by 50%. BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal, however, denies there is a drop in procurement and accuses Congress of misinformation."

This sort of gene editing is banned in the U.S., though Deem said he worked with He on the project in China.Regardless of where it was conducted, this work as described in press reports violates scientific conduct guidelines and is inconsistent with ethical norms of the scientific community and Rice University, the school said in a statement.Gene editing is a way to rewrite DNA, the code of life, to try to supply a missing gene that is needed or disable one that is causing problems. It has only recently been tried in adults to treat serious diseases.Editing eggs, sperm or embryos is different, because it makes permanent changes that can pass to future generations. Its risks are unknown, and leading scientists have called for a moratorium on its use except in lab studies until more is learned.They include Feng Zhang and Jennifer Doudna, inventors of a powerful but simple new tool called CRISPR-cas9 that reportedly was used on the Chinese babies during fertility treatments when they were conceived.Not only do I see this as risky, but I am also deeply concerned about the lack of transparency around the work, Zhang, a scientist at MITs Broad Institute, said in a statement. Medical advances need to be openly discussed with patients, doctors, scientists and society, he said.Doudna, a scientist at the University of California, Berkeley and one of the Hong Kong conference organizers, said that He met with her Monday to tell her of his work, and that she and others plan to let him speak at the conference Wednesday as originally planned.None of the reported work has gone through the peer review process, and the conference is aimed at hashing out important issues such as whether and when gene editing is appropriate, she said.Doudna is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Zhang receives grant support from the organization, which also supports APs Health & Science Department.Another conference leader, Harvard Medical School dean Dr. George Daley, said he worries about other scientists trying this in the absence of regulations or a ban.I would be concerned if this initial report opened the floodgates to broader practice, Daley said.Notre Dame Law School professor O. Carter Snead, a former presidential adviser on bioethics, called the report deeply troubling, if true.No matter how well intentioned, this intervention is dangerous, unethical, and represents a perilous new moment in human history, he wrote in an email. These children, and their childrens children, have had their futures irrevocably changed without consent, ethical review or meaningful deliberation.Concerns have been raised about how He says he proceeded, and whether participants truly understood the potential risks and benefits before signing up to attempt pregnancy with edited embryos. He says he began the work in 2017, but he only gave notice of it earlier this month on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.The secrecy concerns have been compounded by lack of proof for his claims. He has said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.One independent expert even questioned whether the claim could be a hoax. Deem, the Rice scientist who says he took part in the work, called that ridiculous.Of course the work occurred, Deem said. I met the parents. I was there for the informed consent of the parents."

Stalin recently flagged off relief materials to affected areas.On the field, DMK MLAs like T.R.B. Raaja, who represents Mannargudi, have been at the forefront of organising relief materials and using social media to make appeals for more contributions.These relief efforts are not an attempt to earn peoples goodwill, that too at this juncture. We are all working towards getting these areas back on track because this is my soil, my people, Mr. Raaja said.He said the DMK president had visited Mannargudi to help the people. There has been no government help in Mannargudi. This is one of the worst affected regions and things dont seem to be getting any better, he said.Its our dutySanjay Dutt, All India Congress Committee secretary in-charge for Tamil Nadu, said: This is a human tragedy on a massive scale. It [our relief efforts] cannot be seen as an attempt to build goodwill. It is our duty to help our brothers and sisters. We have directed all Congress cadre in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to focus their energy only on the rehabilitation work at the moment.He said the party had arranged food items for the affected regions, and two truckloads of relief materials were dispatched two days ago. We have two more trucks leaving on Monday night, Mr. Dutt said.Things havent improvedMr. Raaja said his party had been arranging relief materials and routing them through party functionaries. This government lacks the brains to even get the basic things done. Everywhere I go in my constituency  this is my second visit to the affected areas after the Cyclone  things have not improved, he said. He claimed that the government had provided only three generators for the Neeramangalam block, which comprises 44 villages. In fact, the people and I are paying for diesel for generators. Why is the government not paying for it? he asked.Mr. Dutt blamed the Tamil Nadu government and the Centre for the failure to respond to this disaster of mammoth proportions. The Centre should have first sanctioned some initial relief before sending a team. The team will visit, submit their report, and then the funds will be granted  this is total insensitivity, the Congress leader said.MNM founder Kamal Haasan camped in the delta region to meet the affected people. Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran was among those to have toured the affected districts.The PMKs Anbumani Ramadoss too visited various relief centres and distributed relief materials to the affected people on the partys behalf.The Dravida Iyakka Thamizhar Peravai said it had collected Rs. 1.28 lakh, with which 171 bags of rice were procured and handed over to Mr. Raaja for distribution in his constituency.

But even when they dont kill, the cost of treatment can get astronomical, pushing the average monthly cost to at least Rs 10,000.Awareness about the known risk factors  diabetes and hypertension  isnt poor, but there seems to be a collective lax towards prevention, early diagnosis, treatment to slow or halt its progression. Statistics show that most patients are unlikely to know they have kidney disease until it reaches advanced stages, say doctors.For instance, the average intake of salt among Indians, is way above the requirement, increasing risks of heart and kidney diseases, strokes, and some types of cancers. Only a few products list the salt content and some list it as sodium. People dont take salt warning as seriously as they do for sugar, said nephrologist Dr Rajan Ravichandran, who heads the Sapiens Foundation and actively campaigns for action against salt intake.An online survey his foundation conducted among 1,500 adults showed that more than 70% of the population was aware that high salt intake is hazardous, but an equal number said they did not look for salt content in packaged foods and 80% of them were not aware of the WHO recommended levels.We see a bigger problem in diabetics who know they are at a greater risk yet fail to bring sugar levels under control, said senior diabetologist Dr V Mohan.The state health department, says several government policies are now directed towards prevention of non-communicable diseases. Through the year we hold massive health camps to detect diabetes and hypertension. We understand prevention is key and a part of it is government responsibility, said director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy. We have made at least three recommendations to the planning commission to strengthen prevention. First is a policy on sugar and salt. We will create awareness on what people should eat and to read labels on processed foods, he said.Second, the state has asked the agriculture department to ensure more small millets are grown so it can partially replace rice in the public distribution system and be availed at a subsidised cost in government supermarkets. Finally, the state has been encouraging local bodies to build large parks, for people to exercise."

After day-long campaigning in politically recharged Chambal-Gwalior region including a roadshow in neighbouring Ashok Nagar,presidentwas visibly upbeat of retaining power in Madhya Pradesh despite three terms of incumbency. After staying the night in Gwalior, he was ready to leave for Telangana. Before leaving, he spoke toon burning issues, including Ayodhya, andreiterated the promise of a grand Ram temple. Excerpts:BJP won many seats after you took over as party chief. But yourparty seems to be strugglingto defeat the challenge of incumbency in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Is the prospect of a setback unsettling you?It is fact that rising expectations have increased the vulnerability of incumbents. A long spell in power did impact your performance in Gujarat polls. You have been in power in MP and Chhattisgarh for 15 years now, whereas in Rajasthan you are up against the pattern of politics where the ruling party has invariably lost polls for two decades. Your party is obviously facing a challenge.Do you think the outcome, whichever way it goes, will have an impact on next years Lok Sabha elections?In Chhattisgarh, Congresss promise of a farm loan waiver appears to have helped them. But BJP did not move to match the promise in MP. Was it too late for you to make a similar announcement? After all, you promised and implemented loan waivers in both UP and Maharashtra.Demand for temple construction in Ayodhya is gaining momentum. RSS and VHP want construction to start and now Shiv Sena is seeking to outpace you on that front. Even Congresss C P Joshi has claimed only they can construct the temple. What is the problem in bringing a legislation to clear the way for temple construction as has been demanded by RSS and VHP?How do you see Congresss promises of gaushala, promotion of cow urine products, and Ram van gaman path. Congress has in the past accused BJP of Hindu polarisation by using these themes. Do you think they will use soft Hindutva from now on?But at the same time, Congress leader Kamal Nath was seen in a video asking Muslim groups to ensure 90% turnout of the community?Leaders like Kamal NathBJP quickly pounced upon remarks by Joshi about the non-upper caste backgrounds of Prime Minister and Uma Bharati, and Raj Babbar who brought in PMs mother. It seems you have too many friends in Congress.You have on several occasions said that illegal immigrants like Rohingyas will be deported but home ministry is planning to give them work permits although they will be disenfranchised?There were reports about anger in upper castes over changes in SC/ST Act. Dont you think it will hurt the party in the three states?In Telangana, BJP is suddenly very aggressive against TRS although there was speculation of a friendly fight between the two parties as TRS supported you in Parliament. What is the party strategy in the state?Rahul Gandhi has used his campaign against the purchase of Rafale fighter jets to attack the PMs image of honesty?The opposition has alleged misuse of central agencies and Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal CMs have withdrawn CBIs general consent. Isnt it a threat to the federal structure of the country?How do you justify dissolution of the J&K assembly? The opposition is alleging that if BJP wont rule, it wont let others rule.That is your perception. I know it is shared by others but I dont agree. BJP will retain power in all three states and the outcome on December 11 will enhance PM Narendra Modis stature as a strong and popular leader who will return as PM in 2019 with bigger numbers.There are two terms in political science  anti-incumbency and pro-incumbency. Unfortunately, our media friends focus on just one of them, that is anti-incumbency. We are contesting assembly polls on the agenda of good governance and development. There is pro-incumbency in the three states as people recognise the good work of our governments and want them to continue. We have implemented 129 welfare schemes in these states through which BJP governments have developed a strong constituency and support base. Anti-incumbency is being talked now just as it was invoked to claim that we would lose Gujarat polls badly. But we formed a full majority government. It is time people talked about performers too.Each election has its own dynamic and logic. Local issues and personalities matter a lot in state elections. However, ours is a federal polity and elections are not completely divorced from each other. They even influence each other. These elections will certainly have an influence on voters across the country and of course on the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Our federal structure is a factor in governance as well. For example, if you talk about Madhya Pradesh, the speed of growth and development in the first two terms of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government was not as fast as it was in the last five years as central assistance increased manifold after BJP formed government at the Centre. The result of 2014 elections created headwind for BJP in state polls as we scored victories in UP, Maharashtra, Haryana and many more. Therefore, I feel the elections in five states are important for us.There is already a loan waiver in MP. Congress government under Digvijay Singh used to give loan to farmers at 18% interest but Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been giving at 5%. Loan of over Rs 13,000 crore in MP has been distributed on 0% interest. Our government has done a lot for farmers. Huge quantities of wheat and rice being purchased at MSP and now soyabean has also been included in the price support scheme. What Chouhan and Raman Singh have delivered in the past 15 years, none has done that much. In UP and Maharashtra, the situation was different as farmers were distressed after years of misrule.Let me reiterate that our commitment to construct a grand temple of Lord Ram in Ayodhya is non-negotiable. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court and lets wait until it is heard in January. However, it should be borne in mind that the case was pending in the SC for nine years and still Congress leader Kapil Sibal went on to demand that the hearing should be taken up after 2019 polls. Lawyers of Akhara, Ram Lalla all have insisted on hearing the case on priority but Congress wanted to postpone it. We are expecting a favourable judgment and let us wait. However, no one can doubt our intentions. Congress should also stop making false claims. About Shiv Sena, we are two different parties although we are in alliance. There is no rift among us on the issue.After 2014, people of the country rejected 21 out of 22 poll manifestos of the Congress. Their manifesto will be rejected again. As far as their embrace of Hindutva is concerned, they are welcome. We have been talking gaushala and all such issues since 1950. We wish all political parties talk about these issues, but not for political gain and only during election season.Not just Kamal Nath wooed a particular community, even C P Joshi (senior Congress leader in Rajasthan) was seen talking about PMs caste and that shows the partys mindset. Congress is desperately trying to reintroduce the politics of appeasement, which has been rejected. People of the country have already suffered a lot but they have seen the true colours of Congress leaders, who were divisive in the past and are again trying to divide society on caste, communal lines.are hell bent on communal politics and appeasement and I am sure they will face the consequences.We dont need Congress leaders cheap gimmicks to boost party morale and our campaign. However, the levels to which Congress leaders are stooping is certainly a matter of serious concern. BJP has pledged to eradicate influence of dynasty, caste and appeasement from the countrys politics. However, Congress is hell bent on reviving them and making them central to the countrys politics. As far as language used by Congress leaders against Modijis mother, it is most unfortunate and highly condemnable.I have insisted on deportation of illegal immigrants settled in the country and I am firm on my commitment. However, there is a process for detection, disenfranchisement and deportation which is time consuming. We also have to abide by international conventions and laws. But we are clear that illegal foreigners are a threat to national security and they must not be allowed to enter. As far as reported work permits from MHA is concerned, I dont think any such initiative has been taken so far.I dont deny outburst of emotions when issues related to caste come to the forefront. However, BJPs main poll plank is inclusive development of all castes and communities. There are schemes of the Centre helping people of all sections. After several days of campaigning, I can say with confidence that BJP is getting support of all castes for its development oriented agenda.There is no question of a friendly fight. We are contesting Telangana assembly polls with full force. In Parliament, TRS had only two options  either to support us or stand with the opposition. They supported us but that does not mean that we are together even in the state.Whether allegations carry conviction or not depend on the image and track record of the person they are levelled against. In case of Narendra Modi, I can say with full conviction that such false allegations will not work as people wont believe it. I challenge Rahul to substantiate the allegations. The Centre has given details of the deal in a sealed envelope in the Supreme Court but Rahul has not done so because his allegations are blatant lies. In MP, they were talking about Vyapam but dropped the matter after the involvement of their own leaders came to light. Congress has no issues against the Centre, therefore, its president is trying to distract attention from core issues like development.What they (Naidu, Mamata) have done is most unfortunate. On CBI, two senior most officers of the agency were up against each other with allegations and counter allegations leaving no option for the Centre but to intervene. Complying with CBI bylaws, the matter related to the director was handed over to the CVC. Where is the scope for allegations against the BJP government. Even in case of RBI, the discussion happened as per the RBI Act, which doesnt amount to interference in independent functioning of the central bank.The decision was the prerogative of the state governor, who rightly dissolved the assembly as horse trading was going on for three days. Even I learnt about the decision through media. The PDP letter for government formation was merely a desperate bid as the letter had no mention of support of the other parties. There was no letter of any group supporting the PDP to form government."

My dream is to make Bihar an organic state like Sikkim, he said.Inaugurating the organic rice harvesting festival organised by Tarumitra on its premises at Digha in Patna, Prem expressed concern over the frequent use of pesticides and insecticides by farmers and its adverse effects on the land. Pesticides are also a health hazard for the farmers as well as the people who consume the farm produce, he said.The minister underlined the need to re-innovate the traditional farming technique such as using cow dung as a natural fertiliser. I have been using organic fertilisers in my farm for a decade to grow vegetables and fruits, he said.Prem expressed happiness over his second visit to Tarumitra and admired the work done by the organic farmers. He performed an aarti in the farm and led a students procession which was taken out as part of the rice-harvesting ceremony. The students also sang harvest songs.More than 200 school and college students, including those of Don Bosco Academy, Gulzarbagh Government Womens College, Baldwin Academy, Vanasthali, Adarsh Bal Vidyalaya, May Flower School, S R Vidyapeeth, St Gabriels International School and Shanti Kutir, along with several educationists and social activists participated in the event.Tarumitra has since 2011 adopted organic way of cultivation on its Digha premises. Tarumitra founder Fr Robert Athickal said Tarumitra was celebrating organic festival for eighth consecutive year.Padmashree Usha Kiran Khan, who was also present on the occasion, threw light on the agricultural landmark of the country, especially Bihar. My literary works have always touched the Indian agriculture along with women empowerment. This organic movement needs to be encouraged for a healthy future, she said.A PowerPoint presentation was also made on the occasion by organic farmer Margaret Molomoo."

It's a big deal.""However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University's George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called ""a major and growing public health threat.""""I think this is justifiable,"" Church said of that goal.In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body.The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that's causing problems.It's only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person.Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different the changes can be inherited.In the US, it's not allowed except for lab research.China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.He Jiankui, who goes by ""JK,"" studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the US before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.The US scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston.Deem also holds what he called ""a small stake"" in 'and is on the scientific advisory boards of' He's two companies.The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods.He said he chose to try embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China.He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said.The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin.Its leader, known by the pseudonym ""Bai Hua,"" told the AP that it's not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.Here is how He described the work: The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization.First, sperm was ""washed"" to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk.A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo.Then the gene editing tool was added.When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing.Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts.In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene-altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said.People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes.""It's almost like not editing at all"" if only some of certain cells were altered because HIV infection can still occur, Church said."

Many millet-themed stores, restaurants and cafes have sprung up in localities; close to 10 establishments serve anything from millet idlis , dosas and thalis to ice-creams and brownies.Even the menu at weddings, house-warming and birthday parties often feature a millet-based buffet, say proprietors. Areas such as Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Basavangudi and Brigade Road are on the radar of those trying to popularise the foodgrain.Jyothi Madinur, proprietor of Vaathsalya Millet Caf in JP Nagar, one of the first millet-themed cafs in the city, said 15 years ago, there were hardly any farmers cultivating millets in Karnataka and neighbouring states.The governments support for cultivation of wheat and rice could be a reason for farmers showing less interest to grow millets. They are naturally organic grains and do not require too much water to grow. I visited many farms in North Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to encourage and convince farmers to switch to millets. There was no demand from consumers and citing this as reason, farmers stuck to financial crops, said Madinur, who has set up a processing unit in Kanakapura.Now, people a re attracted to the high nutritional value of these raw grains, say restaurant owners who see a noticeable rise in the number of requests for millet-based dishes for children.A lot of consumers hav e realized that millets are not just for the health conscious. We aim to make them a staple in every home, as it used to be more than 50 years ago. We conduct millet-cooking workshops as well. The grains are an easy substitute for rice and wheat and also more filling. It has a high-fibre content, can stabilize blood sugar levels and requires little or no water for cultivation. The latter is the biggest reason why millets should be cultivated at a time when were facing effects of climate change, said Abhishek Beeraiah, founder of Millet Mama in Basavangudi, which now also caters to IT companies and directly sources produce from farmers in Tumakuru, Ramanagara and Tamil Nadu."

While a glass of 330ml draught beer is available for Rs 50, a cup of around 100ml tea or coffee is being sold at Rs 60.The stalls selling beer and wine were functional from day one, but the food cart became operational only on Day 3.Tea and coffee being sold is not only unreasonably priced, it is machine-made. This wasnt the case earlier, as there were stalls where Goan womens self-help groups offered tea at a much cheaper price, and it was regular tea. You cannot not provide regular tea. It comes next to water for Indians. Many of us have several cups of it a day, said Hemant Karnik, a delegate from Mumbai.The two stalls set up by groups from Jharkhand offer rice tea and herbal tea for Rs 30 a cup, but it doesnt have many takers as delegates have been looking for the sweet Indian chai.Even the simple lime juice is not available for those who dont want to have an alcoholic drink. The food is so exorbitantly priced that we go home in between the films to eat, said delegate Kadambari Panikar, a resident of Bambolim, around 10km from Panaji.But those who prefer a drink, the exotic flavours of beers and wines on offer are cheap with a glass of sparkling rose wine not exceeding Rs 150.At Kala Academy, the other screening venue, a cup of tea is priced at Rs 10. And just a kilometer away at the main venue, a glass of tea costs Rs 60. It is difficult to travel back and forth between the movie screenings, so I am forced to pay Rs 60 and buy tea here. The food is also very expensive, with a thali costing Rs 250 to Rs 300, that I prefer to spend Rs 60 on tea, a cup or two of which keeps me going, said an elderly female delegate, who did not want to be named."

So if someone says people are dying of starvation, it is untrue. I will not accept it,"" she said at a public meeting here.A section of media recently reported that seven people of Sabar community in Jangalmahal area of Jhargram district died due to starvation.Sabar community is an ethnic tribe, mainly residing in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal.The chief minister also claimed to have received information about people selling off their quota of food grains.""Every person gets 8 kg rice and 3 kg wheat per month. However, I have come to know that people who don't require the grains sell part of their quota in the open market,"" she said.Last week, during her Assembly address, Banerjee had said that the deaths in the former Maoist stronghold resulted from ""age-related ailments"" or ""excessive liquor consumption"".Maintaining that the West Bengal government gave subsidies and sops to people on all occasions, she asserted that no other state could match up to the welfare programmes run by her government.""The former CPI(M)-led Left Front regime had saddled us with debts.The NDA government, too, takes away huge amount of money for servicing debts.However, we haven't let all that factors affect our schemes.""From birth to death, the TMC government doles out benefits on all occasions, including marriage and child birth. No state in country in on par with the West Bengal government when it comes to sops disbursal,"" the chief minister said.Alleging that the BJP was trying to ""divide people on religious lines"", the TMC supremo sought to know the role played the saffron party during Maoist violence in Jangalmahal.""Hundreds of people died every year from Maoist violence and police action during the period of unrest in Jangalmahal. Where were they (BJP) when people were actually starving to death?"" she said.Maoist violence was largely contained in the rural areas of West Bengal after the Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) came to power in 2011.""I had visited all Maoist-affected places, including Lalgarh and Goaltore, where no one dared to tread foot at that time,"" she recounted.Without taking names, Banerjee also alleged that ""Maoists were being brought to Bengal from neighbouring Jharkhand"" to create unrest in the state.She also took at a dig at the Chhattisgarh government for not being able to control the menace.Banerjee's jibe at the Raman Singh-led government came around an hour after eight Naxals and two police personnel were killed in an encounter between ultras and security men in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district.""In Chhattisgarh, the BJP has been in power for many years, but the Maoist violence is still rampant in the state,"" she added."

Nine of the attackers were killed by police while lone survivor Ajmal Kasab was captured and hanged after handed down death sentence by an Indian court.Perpetrators of the 26/11 attack, including its mastermind and banned Jamat-ud Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Speed, continue to roam freely in Pakistan, indicating that Islamabad is not serious in bringing them to justice. The US has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.The 26/11 attack case has entered into the 10th year but none of its seven suspects in Pakistan has been punished yet, showing that the case had never been in its priority list.""The victims of 26/11 have yet to see the masterminds of the attack in the LeT and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) face justice; unfortunately, that is virtually impossible in Pakistan,"" former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official Bruce Riedel told PTI.Riedel, senior fellow and director of Brookings Intelligence Project, believes that another terror attack in India of similar magnitude would result in a war between the two countries.""If another attack of this magnitude occurs, there will be war,"" he said.Pakistan's former envoy to the US Husain Haqqani said: ""With US-Pakistan relations in a tailspin and hawkish attitudes dominating the subcontinent, one cannot predict if and how the situation would be controlled in the event of another major terrorist attack in India, with clear linkages to groups in Pakistan"".Currently a senior fellow and Director for South and Central Asia at the Hudson Institute, Haqqani said Pakistan ""must fulfil its promise of acting"" against the masterminds of the 26/11 attack.""That it has chosen to let them operate freely raises the justifiable concern that Pakistan's deep state does not want to deter or punish terrorists responsible for attacks in India.""In 2008, Pakistan's promise of acting against the LeT and those involved in the Mumbai attack prevented escalation of India-Pakistan hostilities. The US also helped calm things down by sharing intelligence with both Pakistan and India,"" he said.Agreed a senior Bush administration official, who was inside the White House at the time of the 26/11 attack.""That (India-Pakistan war) was a primary concern and a primary scenario that we wanted to avoid,"" Anish Goel, who was director of South Asia in the National Security Council of the White House at the time of the 26/11 attack, told PTI.Noting that there was a lot of pressure on then prime minister Manmohan Singh ""to react kinetically"", Goel said then US president George Bush and secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had to make a lot of efforts including several phone calls to New Delhi, Islamabad and leaders of several American allies to prevent such a scenario.""Bush was very concerned, and got on phone with Singh immediately, offering condolences and urging restraint,"" he said. Rice travelled to the region trying to cool things.""There's a lot of public pressure. I think prime minister Singh himself was showing a lot of restraint and was not inclined to do a counter attack right away, but there was a lot of political pressure on him to do so,"" said Goel.""The US, I believe -- I don't know for sure, you have to ask the Indian government to know -- having counseling or urging him to show restraint, gave him some sort of political leeway and maneuverability to resist the domestic political pressures from those calling for a quick counterstrike on Pakistan,"" he said, adding that at no point there was any evidence of military mobilisation.""There was a sense of nervousness in the then Bush administration about a possible nuclear war in South Asia.The Mumbai terror attack started a day before Thanksgiving  a national holiday in the US  and did not end till Sunday, the last day of the long weekend.Bush not only held situation room meeting on Saturday, but also mobilised his entire administration to try and prevent escalation of the tension,"" Goel added.A senior former Obama administration official said if another attack would have happened like that, it would ""quickly escalates into a regional war"".The current government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already ""taken a tough line"" against Islamabad including a surgical strike, the official said on anonymity.""I could certainly foresee a situation where he (prime minister Modi) escalates those quite a bit in response to the terrorist attack. Then for the US government, I just don't know if the Trump administration would counsel restraint the way the Bush administration did,"" he said adding that the Trump administration might say Indians are justified.""Not only are we not going to stop you, but we're going to help you. I don't know that they would do, but I don't know if they would carry the same message of constraints. So, when you're talking about what could happen in the region, if there was another Mumbai attack after the Pakistanis have promised there's no terrorists operating in our country and we're going after all of them, I could see a scenario which quickly escalates into a regional war,"" he added."

Rajagopal was elated when his daughter R. Jayavarshini told him she was keen on pursuing farming  an avocation that ran in the family  despite having completed an engineering course. The father-daughter duo underwent training at a poly greenhouse plantation in Hosur and began cultivating crops at Rajappan Chavadi near Needamangalam.But their hopes came crashing down as Cyclone Gaja struck. She did not want to take up any other job, and I started the plantation in her name. The yield was very good and encouraging. But Cyclone Gaja turned everything upside down as our greenhouse plantations were completely destroyed, said Mr. Rajagopal, whose plantation was, notably, inaugurated by the District Collector.He had set up three units, covering 25 cents each. Each unit had cost over Rs. 9 lakh for the greenhouse and an additional Rs. 2 lakh for the installation of a drip irrigation system. The government subsidy is limited to one acre, which means the unit would get only Rs. 4.5 lakh as against the Rs. 9 lakh spent on building it.I had a structure capable of withstanding wind speeds of up to 120 km per hour. The destruction [caused by Gaja] shows that the wind speed [during the cyclone] was much higher, said S. Jeethaman Krishna, who took up agriculture after completing an MBA from the University of Wales.We are a family of agriculturists, and I opted for horticulture in Tiruvarur  the rice bowl. I established the plantation in 2013, said Mr. Krishna, who cultivated cucumber, tomato and coriander as an intercrop. He said a unit could produce 20 tonnes of vegetables and bring revenue of Rs. 15 lakh per annum.When asked whether he would be able to use his plantation again, Mr. Krishna said he would have to start from scratch, as the wind had shaken the foundation of the structure. The absence of an insurance scheme was a major problem, he added."

On top of it, the 47-year-old was led out by the police as an accused on Friday evening. For someone out to fox gullible victims, he turned out to be rather naive, enabling the Shadow police to nab him with ease.Having received a tip-off that George was looking for potential buyers for the antler, a policeman approached him in the guise of a buyer. A deal was struck for Rs. 5 lakh and he was asked to come to the hotel room with the horn. He walked in, put up a show and demanded Rs. 5 crore. But the game was over by then, A.B. Vibin, sub-inspector, Shadow police, told The Hindu .The accused said he had the horn with him for two decades, a claim backed by his family as well. But the police refused to accept it. They found images and videos, including that of a sand boa and objects such as rice puller and alloys, on his mobile phone, confirming their suspicion that he had many tricks up his sleeve.Though he had no criminal background, we are pretty sure that he has links with operators dealing in wildlife trophies. The antler he tried to sell us was brought from Bengaluru to be smuggled out to Singapore as air cargo, said Mr. Vibin.Easy money?Forest authorities, however, felt that the antler, as the accused claimed, could have been with him for long and that he was just trying to make some easy money. Unlike genuine wildlife trophies like ivory, which has an international market, demand for stuff like deer antler or sand boa is often artificially created. It is a long chain. Someone fixes an unrealistic price for such stuff and a non-existent demand is created, trapping those looking for fast bucks, said Forest Department sources.Meanwhile, the Forest Department arrested another accused in connection with the case.According to department sources, Jose, 42, of North Paravur, was a middleman who facilitated the deal. Both the accused, who were produced in a Kuruppumpady court, were released on bail."

Following reports that the number of cases is set to go up, health department has initiated vigorous training for officials on Friday.As per the information available with the integrated disease surveillance project of the directorate of health services, 40 cases of H1N1flu were reported in the district in November alone.Three deaths and one suspected case of H1N1 death were reported. Death of a 30-year-old woman, a native of Veli, who was undergoing treatment for H1N1 influenza, was the latest incident. As many as 180 cases and 11 deaths were reported in the state this month. Though health officials are on alert mode, they said that there is no reason to panic.High number of H1N1 cases was first reported in Tamil Nadu. In Thiruvananthapuram , southern areas such as Parassala have recorded higher number of suspected H1N1 cases. This has put the district, which shares border with Tamil Nadu, in alert mode.Dr Neena Rani, district surveillance officer, said that a hike in H1N1 cases is expected this month. We are taking necessary precautions. Around 83 doctors of primary health centres were given training on early detection and intervention. Directions were given to start oseltamivir drug at the earliest for suspected H1N1 cases. Steps have been initiated to stock enough medicines in all health centres, she said.Fever, running nose, cough, sore throat and body ache are some of the common symptoms of H1N1 influenza. It is categorized into three types based on its severity. While A category flu usually disappears after use of paracetamol tablets, B category results in a sudden severity of fever. C category flu requires hospital admission.There is a nation-wide increase in number of HIN1 cases, said Dr Amar Fettle, state nodal officer (H1N1). People should use a handkerchief while they cough or sneeze, he said.Rest is important. It not only helps in preventing the spread of disease, but also eases recovery chances. Frequent washing of hands will help check spread of the disease. The patients must ensure that they take extra food and fruits such as papaya and gooseberry, which are rich in vitamin A and C. Patients should also drink a lot of rice water. They can also have ginger coffee, tulsi coffee and so on, added Fettle.Medical experts opine that delay in taking medication and discontinuation of Oseltamivir after few days are some reasons for fatality."

ShutterstockMadras High Court has suggested that free PDS rice be given only to families living below the poverty line, observing that the current practice of doling out the freebie across the board has turned the people lazy.It said the government was obliged to provide the bare necessities like rice and other groceries to the poor, but noted that successive governments had extended the benefits to all ration card holders for the sake of political gain.Consequently, people began to expect everything for free from the government. As a result, they have become lazy, and migrant workers are being brought in for even menial work, the bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and Abdul Quddhose said.The observations came on Thursday as the court heard a petition challenging the detention, under the Goondas Act, of a man accused of smuggling and selling PDS rice.During the hearing, the Tamil Nadu government said that Rs 2,110 crore had been spent on the distribution of free rice in 2017-18.The judges directed advocate-general Vijay Narayan to sound out the state government on whether the public distribution scheme could be amended to exclude all families that live above the poverty line.In an interim order, the bench sought to know whether any survey had been conducted to identify BPL families and, if so, what their number was, how much rice they needed and what the value of this volume of rice was.This court is not against the distribution of rice to the really deserving, economically backward and poor people. However, it should not be given to people irrespective of their economic status, it said.It added that the Rs 2,000 crore the government spent annually on the scheme amounted to a capital loss, and that since this expenditure occurred every year it amounted to a recurring capital loss.If the scheme benefits people other than poor people/ BPL families, it would amount to unjustly enriching other people at the cost of the public exchequer, the court said.It directed the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation to file its annual reports for the past 10 years and set the next hearing for November 30."

However, because of better realisations, basmati exports were higher in value terms by 6 per cent at $2.25 billion, while the non-basmati variety was down 12 per cent.Traders said the steep hike in minimum support price had affected their export competitiveness from countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar.We had sought a 10 per cent relief from the government for the exports to be competitive. The government has provided 5 per cent, which would help in competing in the global market. With this incentive, we hope to at least meet last years export level, B. V. Krishna Rao, president of All India Rice Exporters Association, told The Telegraph.The government in July this year increased the paddy MSP by 13 per cent to Rs 1,750 per quintal, the biggest hike in six years."

His challenger from the Congress is Vinay Saxena, a four-term municipal councillor, who is new to the constituency. The BJP has held the seat for the past three decades.Making the battle a three-cornered contest is Dheeraj Pateriya, a long-time BJP leader, who turned a rebel after being denied party ticket.Even when the Congress was in government, Jabalpur had voted for the BJP, said Mr. Saxena, as he moved house-to-house seeking votes in the Futataal area. This time, the people want to correct this and will bless us, he said.The Congresss main plank comprises issues such as the lack of a proper sewerage, authorities inadequate response to repeated outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya, the problem of stray cattle and the decision to declare Jabalpur a smart city without public consultation.Just three months ago, a person was gored to death by a stray bull, said Saurabh Sharma, a local Congress leader. But the government still has no answer, added Mr. Sharma, who is also leading a campaign against inflated power bills raised by a private company that has been entrusted the work by the State government.We want to make these elections a fight on local issues but they [the BJP] want to take it to another level since they face anti-incumbency, said Babu Vishwa Mohan, a popular Congress leader in the Hanumantaal area.While the BJP candidate Mr. Jain, declined to speak to The Hindu , citing his campaign schedule, the partys Jabalpur chief, G.S. Thakur, dismissed all talk of anti-incumbency.There would have been anti-incumbency when we wouldnt have worked. People compare 2003 when the Congress was in power with 2018.

You tell me where is anti-incumbency, he said.Notwithstanding the ruling partys confident talk, it is not only the eight seats of Jabalpur but the entire Mahakoshal region  including Chhindwara Narsinghpur, Seoni, Balaghat, Katni, Dindori and Mandla  that accounts for 38 Assembly constituencies, which is witnessing an intense electoral battle.In 2013, the BJP had won 24 seats, and the Congress 13. But this time the Congress aims to change the equation in Mahakoshal.Chindwara is one of the biggest districts in the region, with eight seats, and the Congress is banking on Mr. Naths Chindwara model of development to woo voters in other neighbouring areas as well.Chindwara modelThe development model in Chindwara is second to none, said Jai Vardhan Singh, son of former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh. Kamal Nath ji has set up BPOs, textile units that are providing local jobs.Pointing to the fact that the BJP won four seats in Chindwara in the previous Assembly election, while the Congress won only three, the BJPs Mr. Thakur said: Kamal Nath just couldnt even win all the Assembly seats under his Lok Sabha constituency and, this time, we will improve.In the tribal-dominated districts such as Mandla and Dindori, the Congress is banking on winning back tribal votes by highlighting the BJPs flip flop on the SC/ST Act.The BJP expects the Congresss votes to be split by an alliance between the Samajwadi Party and the Gondwana Gantantra Party, a tribal party."

Out of the meagre amount, Kerala has to pay back Rs. 265 crore to the Centre for the rice and kerosene procured during the floods.The United Nations and the World Bank had pegged the monsoon havoc at Rs. 31,000 crore. The Centres contribution ridiculously fell short of the actual needs of the State.The Centre also forestalled the monsoon relief offered by the United Arab Emirates. It prevented Cabinet Ministers from visiting foreign countries to mobilise funds from the diaspora of affluent Keralites.The National Disaster Management Plan, 2016 envisaged the freedom of State governments to accept donations from foreign countries to manage catastrophes.Mr Vijayan said the Centres stance was puzzling. The Prime Minister and the Home Minister had toured flood-hit Kerala and understood the gravity of the situation.They sympathised with the people of Kerala but offered little help. In contrast, the Centre government gave Rs. 546 crore to Karnataka, which suffered flood damage in just one district in August this year.In Uttarakhand, the Centre spent Rs. 2,300 crore on flood relief.It gave Rs. 940 crore to Chennai, which was ravaged by storm waters in 2015.Rs. 2,683 crore receivedHe said the government had received Rs. 2,683 crore as contributions to the Chief Minister Disaster Relief Fund. Most of it has been used to create habitat for people displaced by the floods that ravaged 14 districts in Kerala. He said Kerala would benefit from crowdfunding once the micro-level reconstruction plans for flood-affected villages were completed. It would enable authorities to raise funds through crowdfunding for location-specific needs."
5ce671d6e8e3fc56af41337f,It’s time for another green revolution,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/its-time-for-another-green-revolution/article25582864.ece,2018-11-24,"The organic food movement has been gathering momentum in India over the past several years. Farmers markets emerged on the scene almost a decade ago with Kavita Mukhis weekly market in Bandra that attracts a posse of dedicated shoppers. Since then, markets have sprung up in several neighbourhoods from Nariman Point, Shivaji Park, and Juhu to Powai, Thane and Vashi. In September, Caf Zoe launched a one-of-its-kind farmers market right inside their sprawling, light-filled space.The restaurant partnered with Taru Naturals, which works with small-scale farmers across India to provide resources and clean tech to enable organic farming. We met Tarus founder/CEO Ruchi Jain, who holds a Masters in Environment Change & Management from Oxford University, and is a passionate advocate of natural, organic farming.To marketWhat we need is to have thousands of farmers markets. People need to see that organic can be affordable, said Jain. Affordability has long been a pain point for the organic movement but the fresh fruits and vegetables at Caf Zoes farmers market are surprisingly well priced and of high quality. We stocked up on tomatoes and cucumbers, both sweet and flavourful, while the pomegranates are the deepest red we have seen and positively bursting with juice. All vegetables and fruits sold at the market come from Anil Rayates farm in Niphad in Nashik district. While farmers around him concentrate on grapes (Nashiks main cash crop), Rayate instead decided to go the organic route in 2009 with a mixed farm where he grows everything from leafy greens to onions, garlic, and other vegetables. He proudly showed us his certification from Participatory Guarantee System for India (PGS-India) a government body that certifies organic farming practices across India.I use traditional farming techniques like natural mulching, using jivamrut fertiliser (a fermented mixture of dung and urine of Indian Gir cows, jaggery, soil, and water), and natural fungicide made of fermented sugarcane juice, cow dung, yoghurt etc., explained Rayate.What made Caf Zoe venture into this area? We are now six-and-a-half years old and it has always been our plan to support communities, not just be a restaurant. Luckily we have been blessed with a large space that enables us to do these things, said Tarini Mohindar, co-founder of Caf Zoe. Mohindar had been toying with the idea of a farmers market for a while and had even spoken to a few organisers. But I didnt want to do something that was massive, just create a space where you can go and stock up on your veggies for the week, and you dont pay through your nose for it. You have a certificate that tells you its organic and theres no middleman involved, she explained. Mohindar met Jain at a pottery workshop organised at Caf Zoe (conducted by Jains sister), and was impressed with the work that Taru Organics did at the grassroots level. The restaurant has held two farmers markets since mid-September and the response has been encouraging. The Sunday brunch crowd has been leaving with bags filled with fresh produce as well as organic staples such as millets, dals, indie rice varieties like Indrayani, khapli wheat (emmer, an ancient wheat variety) atta, jaggery, turmeric, and more. Apart from partnering for the market, Caf Zoe sources produce from Taru Naturals, which also supplies to a handful of Mumbai restaurants like Kala Ghoda Caf, The Pantry, The Bombay Canteen, Olive, SodaBottleOpenerWala etc.Growing trendAs restaurants increasingly make an effort to source organic, a growing tribe of entrepreneurs is stepping in to fulfil the demand. One such is Zama Organics founded by Shriya Naheta. She graduated three years ago and returned to Mumbai from Los Angeles only to find that high-quality, organic produce was hard to come by at reasonable prices. What really inspired me to start Zama were the travels I went on after I was back. I went on a few trips to Uttarakhand and happened to visit farms in Pune and Nashik as well said Naheta. She started working directly with farmers to source organic produce locally, and currently works with three collectives  one small-time farmer in Pune and a group of farmers each in Nashik and Uttarakhand. One of my main sources is in Uttarakhand in a remote and inaccessible location above Nainital; they are so particular about crop rotation, and the time they sow the seeds or harvest the produce. They have really great irrigation from spring waters from the Himalayas, amazing air quality, and they have always grown organically. Everything they need for farming is grown in the farm itself; whatever vegetables get spoiled are inevitably converted into compost to be used back in the farming process, explained Naheta. Zama Organics supplies to restaurants like Masque, Suzette, Sequel, Rolling Pin, Quattro etc.Naheta also launched value-added products like honeys, jams, chutneys, and pickles, which were recently showcased at a four-course dinner at Masque. We want to really educate people on the concept of sustainability and gradually but surely create a shift, where people look at the benefits of eating sustainably grown and wholesome food, she said.Jain agrees; Restaurants are the harbingers of food innovation in India. So if restaurants like Caf Zoe make a statement with such markets that support small-scale organic farmers, we can get the message across, she said. Rayate had the last word; Now, everyone knows the ill effects of chemicals used in farming. Natural farming is the only solution if we have to sustain this for our future generations he said.Fresh produce and staples from Taru Naturals (tarunaturals.com) and Zama Organics (zamaorganics.com) can be ordered online with delivery available across Mumbai. The next Farmers Market at Caf Zoe will be held on Sunday, November 25 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.SANNIDHANAM: A week into the annual Mandalam season, there has been a huge dip in the revenue generated from Sabarimala following massive reduction in footfall due to the ongoing row over the Supreme Courts verdict on womens entry.Sources said 80,000 to 1 lakh pilgrims visited the shrine daily during the main pilgrimage season last year. However, the footfall this year from November 16th evening, when the temple opened for the season, to Thursday afternoon was just 1.5 lakh.Sources said there was a 33% dip in the revenue generated through offerings at hundis (offering box). The crowd at Sabarimala has always been unpredictable and we hope that footfall will increase in the coming days, said commissioner of Travancore Devaswom Board N Vasu. The board said over 6 crore devotees visited the temple last year, generating a revenue of Rs 255 crore.Theres also a huge dip in offerings. Devotees from other states bring half a kilo of rice in their irumudikettu (offering for Lord Ayyappa). The rice is machine-sorted and auctioned or used for vazhipadu (rituals). This year, rice deposits have fallen, said a TDB employee. Over a dozen rice offering centres at Sannidhanam where at least one truckful was collected daily from each counter last year  were collecting just a few sacks each day during the past week.Another important source of revenue is auctioning space to vendors. Almost 40% of space, which in previous years would be sold quickly after a bidding war, is yet to be auctioned. Auctions are still going on and TDB has brought down the rates by 35%, said a vendor.Revenue generation through appam and aravana sale is yet to gain momentum as TDB had to cut production of appam, owing to the fall in demand. TDB is also battling with food and accommodation requirements thanks to additional police deployment at Sabarimala. Compared to overall deployment of 2,000 policemen last year, nearly 4,000 have been deployed."

He strapped one to himself and the other to Haven's mom and placed Haven, then 14 months old, in between.The parents died instantly.Haven was catapulted out the door. Her legs were mangled beyond repair, but she survived.Her adopted parents, Rob and Shelly Shepherd, have pictures of Haven sitting on her maternal grandmother's lap a few days after the explosions, on a metal bed against a wall in a hospital that looks more like an Army barracks. The baby is wearing a gold tank top, holding a twig from a fruit tree. Her legs are meticulously wrapped at the ends of the stumps that remained after doctors removed everything below both knees.Months later, when the Shepherds brought Haven to a hospital in Kansas City, the surgeons were amazed. Often, children whose legs are amputated at a very young age encounter problems that require revisions through the years  surgeries that can be every bit as daunting and debilitating as the original amputations.Not for Haven.""They said the amputation was, like, perfect,"" Shelly Shepherd said.It's one of the many reasons Haven, now 15, developed into an elite swimmer and now has her sights set on the Paralympics in 2020.This 2004 photo shows Haven Shepherd sitting on her grandmother's lap in a hospital in Vietnam. APMiracle No. 2: Forgiveness.Maybe it's adolescent naivet. Perhaps it's due to wisdom beyond her years. Most likely it's a bit of both. But Haven harbours no resentment toward the birth parents who tried to blow her up.She was too young to remember any of it  not her birth mother who raised her in the early months, not the explosion that propelled her 30 feet out the door, not the grieving grandparents who had her potty trained before she was 2 and took care of her until the Shepherds came.""This is the dilemma about me,"" Haven says. ""I don't feel anything toward them because, in the end, they gave me the best life I could imagine.""That life begins in a desolate, thatched-roof hut in a remote village in Quang Nam Province in Vietnam.Her birth family was, by accounts from local newspapers at the time, the poorest in the village.According to the story told to Rob and Shelly when they arrived to bring Haven back to the United States, her parents weren't married to each other.Divorce in Vietnam was taboo, not considered an option. And because Haven's birth parents were each married to other people and had very little to live on, they felt stuck.And while the Shepherds reached out to help Haven recover from the unthinkable, the unwanted baby from Vietnam helped heal her adopted family, too.Two years before Haven was born, Rob and his brother Terry were towing a dunk tank from a company picnic at a rural flour mill in Pierce City, Missouri. As they exited, the truck got tangled on a decorative archway that guided visitors to the party, lurching backward as the tank fell forward.It landed on Terry's neck, killing him instantly.Four years earlier, Rob's dad died of a heart attack.The sudden, unexpected deaths of two of his closest relatives  who were also partners in the family's longtime hardwood-flooring business  shut off a light within Rob. The couple sometimes doubted it could be rekindled.""He was suffering in silence,"" Shelly Shepherd said. ""It's what made it so cool about seeing him on the trip to Vietnam. I could see him beginning to come back alive.""Before the trip, the Shepherds had reached another turning point.Though they had six children, Shelly started following stories about orphans in faraway lands who lived in abject poverty. She began feeling an urge to adopt.""It became the last thing I would go to bed thinking about, the first thing I thought about when I woke up,"" she said. ""We had to go through marriage counseling. I was like, 'I want to let this go, but I can't.'""Rob eventually, though reluctantly, came around to the idea of adopting a child. But the trip to Vietnam was not for that.The Shepherds made the journey to accompany Pam and Randy Cope, who sought permission to find a home for Haven in the United States after the story of the baby girl who survived her parents' suicide made big news in Vietnam.The Copes ran a foundation to help care for street kids in the country  established following the death of their own 15-year-old son, Jansen  and used their connections to open a path to place Haven with another family.It was going to be a difficult trip to one of the remotest corners of the country  a journey filled with red tape, government officials and, of course, the emotional handover of the girl from her still-grieving grandparents, who did not have the resources to care for her. The Copes asked the Shepherds if they wanted to come along.Rob and Shelly remember the trip vividly  from the long motorcycle ride through the jungle on roads that turned into paths; to the swarms of kids who scurried out of their ramshackle huts when Rob pulled out the bag of lollipops; to the rice that Haven's grandmother spilled onto the porch then quickly scooped up upon their arrival.They remember the way Haven pressed herself against Rob, at first, sensing he was the one she'd need to win over right away.They remember sensing, as they held the young girl and bonded with her, a gratefulness that could only be felt, not spoken.They remember feeling that something was changing.""We just kept saying, 'Her adopted parents should be here,'"" Shelly said.One night in Saigon, as they waited at the hospital for Haven to get the shots and medical papers needed for the trip back to America, Haven wore Shelly's sunglasses and bounced on her knee.Shelly swung her up high and Haven let out a huge belly laugh.""I felt something inside of me,"" Shelly said. ""It was like, 'Oh ... she's my child.'""Shelly didn't sleep a wink on the 38-hour journey from Saigon to the airport inTulsa, where she and Pam Cope handed off Haven to her adopting parents for the ride to her new home in southwest Missouri.It was devastating for Shelly.She had fallen in love with this young girl  nurtured her during the precious moments after her grandparents gave her away, been wooed by the infectious smile and the way she'd charmed Rob and brought him back to life.""The whole experience had that feeling of, 'What just happened?'"" Rob said. ""When we got off the motorcycles, and the grandma handed Haven to Shelly, and she was the very first person who touched her, I knew it. I was in trouble.""Haven Shepherd prepares for a race in July 2016. APMiracle No. 3: A second chance.Though the placement family had the best of intentions, it was not a perfect fit. The most pressing issue was that they already had their hands full with a 2-year-old girl at home.Shelly returned back to her busy life and gave up the idea of adoption. Though they had not considered bringing a child into their house with disabilities, the two weeks in Vietnam changed that. In Shelly's mind, she had found her baby but was forced to hand her off. No other child could replace that.It was Pam Cope's duty to make occasional visits to ensure everything was going well at the adopting home. When Shelly asked her friend how things were going, she noticed Cope's hesitation.After several more weeks, the call came. It was Shelly's birthday.""She said, 'I think we need to talk,'"" Shelly said.The Shepherds named her Haven  a name Shelly had long liked, and one that took on a whole new meaning after she and Rob received the toddler in their home. Next summer, Shelly will bring Haven back to Vietnam to meet the grandparents who gave her away 14 years ago.Haven isn't keen on the trip. Her mother feels it's necessary.""She says she doesn't need that, but I tell her, 'It's not about you,'"" Shelly says. ""It's about the fact that they gave us our child and, for you, you don't remember the pain in your grandmother's face. I hold that as a responsibility.""""I understand all this,"" Haven says. ""But really, I'm a country girl. I know where I came from.""With its population of 14,000, Carthage, Missouri is the kind of small town where everyone knows everyone.Given the long line of basketball and volleyball players, runners and softball stars who came up in the Shepherd household, it was more or less a given that, legs or no, Haven would be an athlete of some sort.She picked swimming, a sport her parents might have predicted shortly after they met her and placed her in the swimming pool, where they got the first glimpse of a smile that would change their lives.Haven swims 4,000 to 6,000 yards a day in preparation for a possible trip to Tokyo, for the Paralympics in 2020.It's a pressure-packed journey that, at times, can feel overwhelming.Sometimes, Haven worries about letting down a legion of fans that grows as her story becomes better-known and she and her mom broaden their footprint in the motivational speaking circles where they are in growing demand. Their key message: ""It's cool to be different.""Sometimes, Haven worries about letting down her family, well aware of the reputation for excellence the Shepherds have carved out in Carthage. Sometimes, Haven worries about being left behind and not being able to have fun with her friends in Tokyo.And at times, she is brought back to the humbling reality of how fortunate she is  and how swimming is only one part of her story.These days, when Shelly Shepherd tells that story, it elicits gasps  sometimes an involuntary ""Oh my God""  from the people who hear it.As her mom gets ready to deliver the gut punch  often to strangers who stop to chat with the friendly mom-and-daughter pair at Walmart, on the street, in the airport  Haven, standing to the side, will sometimes stealthily mouth the words: ""Wait for it. Wait for it.""Once the shock subsides, a beaming Haven assures whoever is listening that she's doing just fine.""I don't think I could've lived anywhere else or been raised any differently than how I was,"" she said. ""I'm a small-town girl from Missouri. When it comes to getting adopted, I got the long end of the stick."""

The court was hearing a habeas corpus plea moved by an accused in a rice smuggling case challenging his detention under the Goondas Act.It is brought to the notice of this court that for 2017-18, 2,110crore has been spent for distribution of free rice. 2,110crore is a huge amount, which should be spent judiciously including for infrastructure building. Government spends more than 2,000 crore and the money spent under this head would be like capital loss and the expenditure occurs every year and it is recurring capital loss, though it serves the people, the bench said.If the scheme benefits people other than poor, it would amount to unjustly enriching other people, at the cost of the public exchequer. Free rice should be given to families below the poverty line alone, the bench added and directed the government to file a report whether any survey had been conducted to identify BPL families. If so, how many families were below the poverty line in Tamil Nadu? If rice was distributed only to those people, what would be the volume required and the budget needed?To this, advocate general Vijay Narayan sought time to get instructions on whether the scheme could be amended so that those above the poverty line could be excluded.Recording the submission, the bench said the state had to provide bare necessities such as rice and other groceries to the needy. However, successive governments had extended the benefits to all for political benefits.Consequently, people have become lazy and we have to import workers from northern states even for menial works, the bench said and posted the plea to November 30 for further hearing."

Another delegation from Ukraine in central Asia is scheduled to visit the state to explore business opportunities in organic vegetables.Khorlo Bhutia, the secretary of both the agriculture department and Sikkim Organic Mission, said delegations of two Japanese companies, Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan and Kowa Company Ltd, and a team from the trade office of the South Korean embassy had held exploratory talks.The Japanese are also interested in importing sticky rice produced here. Sticky rice is being grown in 0.2 hectares of land at Kameray village in East Sikkim on an experimental basis. Even though it is being done on a trial basis, we are confident of its success, said Bhutia.South Korea, on the other hand, wants to import vegetables like garlic, zinger, cabbage, chilies and buck wheat.Even though Sikkim is a certified organic state, the Japanese and Koreans will conduct their own tests in their respective countries to see if the produce from here meets their standards.Once they are satisfied, they will start importing Sikkims organic produce, said Bhutia.D. K. Bhandari, the Sikkim horticulture secretary, said once those countries started importing local produce, it would give the agriculture sector a massive boost and provide business opportunities to the youth.We would like to appeal to the unemployed educated youth to take advantage of the opportunity by adopting organic farming and allied businesses, he said.Even though Sikkim is a fully organic producing state, it is not yet a fully organic consuming state because of multiple reasons, including massive gap between demand and supply, lack of production of certain vegetables like potatoes and onions, and the high cost of organic vegetables as compared to non-organic ones.Sikkim produces 91,000 metric ton of organic vegetables annually, but its requirement is 1,20,00 metric ton. In April this year, the state had imposed a ban on the sale of non-organic vegetables barring five items, including onions and vegetables. As the ban was ineffective, the government lifted the restriction on five more vegetables last month."

Swaminathan commission recommendations. They are also seeking land rights for farmers and compensation for farm labourers.The march started with 5,000 farmers from Thane, around 23km from here, and will culminate on Thursday in Mumbais Azad Maidan where they will be joined by another 15,000 farmers.Eight months ago, farmers led by the All-India Kisan Sabha had walked 180km from Nashik to Mumbai with similar demands. The march then had received widespread support from Mumbai residents.The farmers are carrying 2kg of rice and 1kg of dal. They will camp in Mumbai till the demands are met, said Pratibha Shinde, general secretary of the Lok Sangharsh Morcha.The government had assured that the Recognition of Forest Right Act would be implemented in six months. Out of the 3.64 lakh claims, only 5,448 claims have been disposed of. It is still a long way to go for the farmers and tribals, Shinde added.The march comes at a time when a drought-like situation has aggravated agrarian distress in the state. With the general election and the state Assembly polls both scheduled for next year, the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state cannot afford to ignore the farmers demands.The state government should provide compensation to the farmers in the drought-hit areas for buying foodgrain. They have lost their crops and need compensation, Shinde said.Water conservationist Rajendra Singh, who joined the farmers, said the gap between schemes on paper and their implementation was widening.There are many schemes dogged by faulty implementation. Water is diverted to cities while the farmers dont get enough for irrigation, he said."

On Wednesday, the villagers staged a road blockade to highlight their plight and agreed to disperse only after officials negotiated with them.Turning blind eyeWe are not seeking relief material. We just want the officials to see for themselves the damage caused to our crops. Officials are covering villages on the main road and turning a blind eye to places tucked away inside, charged S. Jayaraman, who mobilised the villagers.Since it is located near the seashore, sea water has entered the village and made the groundwater saline.This has made the land unsuitable for cultivation in the near future.Almost 1.5 km of the village was under sea water, said R. Asaithambi, even as he collected water from the nearby waterbody in his hands and displayed it.I lost 500 coconut trees and casuarinas, planted in two acres of land.

Jayapal, an agricultural labourer, has witnessed the fury of four cyclones in his life so far. A native of Thalaignaiyuru in Nagapattinam district, an area prone to cyclones, he has been flummoxed by the devastation caused by Cyclone Gaja.We have been left with nothing. We live in a camp as all our houses have been destroyed. My family does not even have a mango or tamarind to make fish kuzhambu . All is gone, and I am too old to see another mango tree or tamarind tree bearing fruits for the family, Jayapal told The Hindu .Vanished hamletsA grim picture unfolds as one travels from Velankanni to Thalaignaiyuru.Once small hamlets, Chadayankottakam, Cherankulam, Karapidakai, Chinthamani, Palattankarai and Ekarajapuram have simply vanished. There is not a single tree that has not borne the cyclones brunt. The remnants resemble a broken movie set or an area that has been carpet-bombed. There is no trace of Palattankarai having existed there, said Mr. Jayapal.Except concrete houses, there are hardly any structures that have remained untouched by Gaja in Vedaranyam taluk. Huts were swept off while tiled-roof houses retained only their walls, with many of them having crumbled under the weight of trees, coconut palms in particular, and cell phone towers felled by the speeding wind. The ferocity of the wind was such that it had chopped the trunk of coconut trees into two or three pieces. Students had lost their books and stationeries. Women were cooking on the streets or in camps, while men were mending the roofs of their homes.Villages on the main thoroughfare caught the attention of officials. We have remained in the dark ever since the night the cyclone changed our lives forever. We do not have drinking water. The entire village is living in camps, complained N. Sankar of Karapidakai.Such was their desperation for help that villagers rushed to any passing vehicle and poured out their complaints, believing the passengers to be officials.As many as 164 of the 170 houses in Santhanam Street in Thalaignayiru had been destroyed. Around 700 residents of the locality  all agricultural labourers  were living in a camp in the Panchayat Union School.Back to the hut ageThe cyclone has turned the clock 50 years back, and we are facing a situation akin to the period when we had only huts, said Somu Elango, a social activist from Thalaignayiru.The one bag of rice and Rs. 3,000 per day that the government is providing is inadequate to feed the 700 mouths thrice a day and to buy provisions and firewood, said Mr. Somu.Year after year, people were being subjected to natures fury, and it was no longer possible for them to get back to living a normal life after Gaja, former Nagapattinam MLA Nagai Mali said.

The woebegone sight of the once lush paddy fields of Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, joining the watery expanse of Vembanad Lake is unlikely to be erased from the minds of farmers any time soon.Farmers suffered huge losses after the entire second crop was washed out. With two back-to-back floods claiming everything they possessed, hope was in short supply as everyone scrambled to rebuild lives. But, they just could not stop in front of adversities as paddy is everything for them.Three months after the devastating floods, farmers in the region are starting to smile again. They have shown resilience and agility in preparing the flood-hit fields for the Puncha season and have overcome the shortage of seeds.According to the Agriculture Department, the Puncha-season sowing is nearing completion in Alappuzha district. The department has set a target of around 30,000 hectares for paddy farming, up from 23,000 hectares last year, a major portion of which is in Kuttanad.Sowing almost donePrincipal agricultural officer Beena Natesh told The Hindu that 90% of the sowing was completed in the region. It was a big challenge to prepare the fields following the deluge. The department has provided necessary help to Padasekhara Samithis to rebuild around 125 breached bunds. Then came the shortage of seeds. But, we have been able to overcome all challenges. Compared to the previous Puncha season, the paddy acreage in the district will see a rise this time around. Overall, paddy sowing has been completed in 60-70% of the targeted area in the district. We expect sowing to be over by the end of this month. We will distribute seeds to farmers who are yet to get them, Ms. Natesh said. The Agriculture Department has so far distributed 3,500 tonnes of seeds to farmers free of cost. It will distribute 150 tonnes more in the coming days. Those who have bought seeds on their own will be reimbursed, officials have said.Areas where the seeds are still to be sown include Mavelikara, Chengannur, and a few places in Kuttanad  Neelamperoor, Pulinkunnu, Veliyanad, and Kavalam.CompensationOfficials said the distribution of compensation to farmers who suffered losses in the recent floods was on. Around 40,000 farmers have been given the aid. We are awaiting the release of State funds to compensate the rest, an official said."

Be it a tree shade or a bund between two farm fields, it can be converted into the venue for the meeting and the stakeholders from the vicinity such as farmers and cattle rearers will take part in the meeting to give their feedback on the implementation of various schemes. The first such meeting was held at Pedda Bheerampalli village near here under the stewardship of Project Director of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency Nishant Kumar. It was decided to address the low-voltage problem at the Musurumilli lift irrigation scheme and to undertake repairs to the interior roads on priority basis. Distribution of pigeon pea seed to the tribal farmers from the next kharif season and steps to install mini rice mills in the tribal villages were the other decisions taken by the meeting that was held under a mango tree. Conducting review meetings in the fields will for sure help us understand the ground realities. Once we know the requirements, schemes can be designed accordingly, pointed out Mr. Nishant Kumar.Observing that more and more tribal farmers were evincing interest in zero-budgeted natural farming and intercropping, the official said that the soil was suitable for the natural farming. Minimum support from the government will help the farmers earn more profits from agriculture. We are planning to rope in bankers too in the meetings, so that delay in extending financial help to the needy can be avoided, he explained.Visit to nearby villageOn his visit to nearby Ootla village, where a good number of tribal farmers have been to sericulture, Mr. Nishant Kumar interacted with the mulberry farmers and noted down the issues raised by them. Paddy cultivation is going on in 8,100 acres in the Agency and cotton is planted in another 2,000 acres. There is a need to encourage aquaculture and sericulture here, besides extending support in the form of distributing cattle and poultry birds to the families, he said while referring to the agenda of the meetings to be conducted in the future."

Even as rescue operations are underway, Coimbatore has started doing its bit for the victims by sending relief and rehabilitation materials to the affected areas.C4TN, a group of 60 NGOs in the city, which was formed during the Chennai floods in 2015, has already sent four trucks of relief material. We have sent two loads to Kattimedu (ThiruthuraiPoondi), one load to Sendangadu (Pattukottai) and one load to Keeramangalam (Pudukottai). The biggest challenge was to reach these flood-affected areas as most of the roads are blocked. We have a base station where we are collecting materials and then supplying it to the victims, using two-wheelers and tri-cycles. The expenses have shot up this time around as the toll fee has not been waived. This was not the case when we were sending materials to Kerala flood victims and Chennai rain victims, says CGS Manion, co-ordinator of C4TN.Vignesh Kumar of Coimbatore Bikers Club, who is at Thiruthuraipoondi, supplying relief materials, tells us, The areas are marred by protests as the government relief has not reached them yet. Most of the relief materials sent here are by NGOs and other organisations. And, because of the protests and roadblock, it took us eight hours to reach certain areas. The good news is that the situation is slightly improving day by day.Food Bank Coimbatore is all set to send its first consignment this weekend. The public wants to help the victims, but they dont know how to contribute. We shared the requirements on social networking pages and soon we were flooded with enquiries. We have been collecting medical kits, water, milk powder, rice and dal, bread, biscuits, mosquito coils, candles, lighters, dress material for children, bleaching powder, gloves, cleaning items to name a few. We have opened collection centers across the city where relief material can be dropped, says Vaishnavee Balaji, founder of the food bank.However, Manion feels that Gaja victims are not getting the needed attention. The inflow of relief material is not so encouraging. I think the emotional connect is slightly less this time as there are too many distractions like the protests in the affected areas and the Sabarimala issue. Many are not aware of the magnitude of the problem. We will continue to send relief material for the next two to three days. Since, there are prolonged power cuts, we need solar lanterns, mosquito coils, etc. Rain is predicted in the state tomorrow and we will be working on stock accumulation. We are slowly moving from relief to rehabilitation. We are appealing for utensils, grocery and tarpaulin sheets."

Police said the two clicked a selfie near the well and made it their display picture on both their WhatsApp accounts before taking the drastic step. Their footwear, anklets and cellphones were found outside the well, which led police to conclude that the duo had jumped in. No suicide note was found and the motive is not clear. Their phones could hold a clue though. This is the fourth case of suicide at the well located in Aareys unit number six in a span of two years.Minakshi and Sonali (names changed) were friends and neighbours at a tribal hamlet in Aarey. Their parents grow rice and sell it, besides doing odd jobs for a living. Minakshi was in Class XII while Sonali had dropped out after SSC and had taken up sewing. The girls left their homes on Tuesday afternoon without informing their families. Around 4pm, a known young boy spotted the two headed towards the well but they forbade him from disclosing their whereabouts to us, Sonalis father told TOI.Before taking the plunge, the girls called up a male friend and told him of their decision. He immediately called up my son who was at work. By the time my son reached the well, the girls had taken their lives, he added. Fire brigade was summoned and the bodies were pulled out around 11.30pm.The girls families and friends said the two had not shown any signs of being depressed nor told anyone of any problems.On Monday night, Sonali told me that she wanted five dresses that she had seen on a TV show. I promised to get them for her and placed an order. The clothes will arrive in a few days but my daughter is not around to wear them, said her father.

Naik, Vice- Chancellor of University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences(UAHS), Shivamogga, has stressed on the need to create a brand value for native rice varieties.He was speaking at an awareness programme for farmers on the campus of UAHS, Shivamogga on Monday.He said that native rice varieties are known for their distinct taste, aroma and nutrient values and there is a spur in the demand for them in recent times. It is necessary to promote experiments related to preparing value-added products from native rice. The nutrient value of native rice differs from one variety to another. It is necessary to document the nutrient value by conducting proper study and research in this regard. The creation of brand value for native rice would augment the income for its cultivators, he said.G. Krishnaprasad, convener of Sahaja Samrudha, a forum of farmers engaged in promoting native farming practices, said that it is necessary to organise exhibitions of native rice and millet varieties regularly at moffusil centres to promote their consumption.H.R. Basavarajappa, working president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, said that the high dosage of fertilizers and pesticides administered for cultivation of improved and hybrid varieties of paddy has proved to be detrimental to human and soil health.Moreover, farmers are forced to spend huge sums of money for purchasing the chemical inputs. The cultivation of native varieties of paddy in organic farming method has proved to be economically viable as the cost incurred here is less and the returns are lucrative, he said.The sowing seeds of native paddy varieties produced by the university were handed over to the farmers on the occasion. B.R. Gurumurthy, Director of Research of the university, and Saroja Patil, progressive farmer, were present on the occasion."

In the last century, 94% of the worlds seed variety has disappeared.In an effort to preserve seed diversity, essential for reducing crop diseases and increasing food supply, a few organisations have come forward to conserve them.In Jawahar block of Palghar district, Pune-based Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation (BIAF) has set up a seed bank with a collection of 547 varieties of rice and millets. There are 250 varieties of rice, 38 varieties of finger millets and 10 varieties of little millets.Sanjay Patil of BIAF said that the seed bank is an attempt to revive the seed varieties that are still preserved in some tribal pockets of the state.Wherever farmers have taken to sugar cane, cotton or other cash crops, the local varieties of food crops have nearly all been lost. The richness of diversity remains in tribal pockets, where there are no cash crops. However, even in these areas, we have had to identify the seed savers. This variety of jowar, for instance, is called chikani jowar  it is too oily for making rotis, and local people use it for making pappad, or for whipping up a wet gruel, he said, holding up a sample that he is putting up for display at the Wadia College Grounds, where a two-day festival of seed diversity is underway.Patil said BAIF works among tribals in the states six districts  Pune, Ahmednagar, Gadchiroli , Palghar and Nandurbar. The NGO holds exhibitions in schools to create awareness among children about different varieties of seeds and encourages kids to bring samples from home.Mono-cropping and hybridisation has affected seed diversity, but we find that for food and nutrition security, for better fodder quality for domestic animals and even greater environmental sustainability, it is important to conserve diversity in seeds. That is what we have been engaged in preserving seed varieties for 10 years, and the results have been promising, said Patil."

Take precautions for traveller's bug,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/travelling-take-precautions-for-traveller-s-bug/cid/1675970,2018-11-21,"The holiday season has started and elaborate plans are being made for pilgrimages, trips to holiday resorts and visits to exotic locations. Unfortunately, 40-60 per cent of travellers will be exposed to disease-causing bugs, which result in sundry infections. Of these, 'traveller's diarrhoea' is the most common and incapacitating. It forces sightseeing and travel to be put on hold, as the search for a toilet becomes a priority.The diarrhoea usually sets in within two to seven days of travel. It is watery and may be associated with other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and urgency. The good news is that it is self-limiting. It usually subsides within two or three days with or without treatment. One of the critical features of the travellers diarrhoea is that local hosts are immune to it. Their intestines have developed resistance over the years to the offending organism.Viruses belonging to the enterovirus and rotavirus family, bacteria (especially E.coli) and protozoa-like giardia can all cause traveller's diarrhoea. In 70 per cent of the patients, no one agent has been found to be responsible. There is therefore no universal cause and no common cure.Although the disease is self-limiting and usually subsides on its own, it is essential to prevent complications like dehydration. Fluids, such as correctly reconstituted, commercially available packets of ORS (oral rehydration solution), homemade ORS (1 litre of water, 1/2 tsp salt and 6 level tsp of sugar), salted rice gruel, khichdi, bananas, lightly salted buttermilk and lime juice with sugar and salt can be consumed for hydration. Alcoholic drinks and caffeinated, carbonated beverages are not recommended. It is also best to avoid milk. Keep in mind that rehydration will not reduce the frequency or quantity of the stool. It will only prevent complications.The frequency of diarrhoea can be reduced with anti-motility agents such as loperamide (imodium). More than 4-8 tablets should not be used as it can cause dizziness and bloating. These tablets are not advised for children under six years of age. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed, as often the diarrhoea is due to viruses or protozoa which do not respond to these medications. Also, inappropriate antibiotic treatment does not reduce the frequency and duration of diarrhoea. It is only likely to produce side effects like monilial overgrowth and resistant organisms. Superinfection with some of these organisms can be life-threatening. If the diarrhoea persists for seven days or more, antibiotics may be required with a medical consultation. A short three-day course is usually sufficient. Taking random antibiotics before travel to prevent diarrhoea will also not work.If the diarrhoea persists for 10 days or more after travel, it needs to be investigated. If it is associated with belching, bloating and large unformed stools, it may be due to giardia. If there is blood and mucous, organisms like shigella or cryptococcus may be responsible. If the diarrhoea persists a month or more, and no infectious agent can be found, it may be due to a non-infectious cause or a complication that has set in, such as IBS (inflammatory bowel disease) or milk allergy.Here are precautions you can take to reduce the likelihood of diarrhoea "

Ramasamy, former Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, does not completely endorse what Mr. Ranganathan said, but emphasises that seasonal fish culture can be taken up by farmers to supplement their agricultural income.As for the prawn farms, he said maintenance is an important issue that cannot be handled by every farmer. However, this position was not shared by others. Pointing out that Nagapattinam forms part of the traditional rice bowl of the State, Mani Shankar Aiyar, former Union Minister, who was elected from the Mayiladuthurai parliamentary constituency (which covers the district) thrice, said that it would be a great loss to the nations food security.He called for designing appropriate insurance policies that would protect farmers against cyclones and water shortages.Dam runoff helpsO.S. Manian, Handlooms Minister and Vedaranyam legislator, said that if water gets released from the Mettur dam on the scheduled day of June 12, there will be no problem.Recalling that prawn farms too were affected during the 2015 floods, K. Balakrishnan, State secretary of the CPI(M) and farmers leader, said that even though he does not view prawn farming as the alternative, there is a need for studying ways to improve the situation, a suggestion accepted by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.Quoting the 2015-16 figures of the districts paddy production, the official asked: When the district produces 3.4 lakh tonnes of paddy from around 1.5 lakh hectares, providing livelihood to 1.73 lakh land-owning farmers and over three lakh labourers, why should it give up paddy?"

Dhinakaran on Sunday questioned why the Chief Minister had not visited the affected areas yet. He demanded that the government raise the compensation for the families of those who lost their lives in the cyclone.Interacting with journalists at his residence in Chennai, Mr. Dhinakaran said: Why is he [the CM] afraid [of visiting the cyclone-affected areas]? He should have gone there. I saw [reports] this morning on TV that he would be visiting the affected districts only after attending the functions that had been scheduled before the cyclone struck. This is what the CM said. This is similar to when Nero played the fiddle while Rome burned.Mr. Dhinakaran recalled that former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa visited Tsunami-hit areas a day after the disaster struck. Explaining that his initial appreciation of the precautionary measures taken for Cyclone Gaja was only based on media reports, he alleged that the relief operations were bad.Essential supplies hitRecalling a cyclone that hit the Delta districts in 1977 when he was in school, Mr. Dhinakaran said that the then Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran took sufficient steps to restore normalcy. But now, MLAs and Ministers are being chased away from the [cyclone-affected] areas. People there are so angry. This government is boycotting the Delta areas, he claimed.The supply of drinking water, milk, rice and other essential commodities had been severely hit, and the State government should have ensured sufficient supply even before the cyclone struck areas like Mannargudi, Tiruthuraipoondi, Muthupettai, Velankanni and others, he contended. On the other hand, Tasmac shops are open there, he added.To another query, the AMMK leader said he would appear before the CBI Court on December 5 in connection with a case registered against him on the charge of attempting to bribe the Election Commission for obtaining the Two Leaves symbol of the AIADMK. He said he would go on to prove his innocence."

And now, 4-5 of them are regulars here, says Ishpreet Singh, a Punjabi, seen tossing the flat bread on a hissing plate at the Shake Square every evening.Although for many businessmen, professionals and students from other States, finding dishes familiar to their taste buds here has become easier and convenient, yet with tastes remaining incomplete, they are reluctant to call them homely.Do you remember how much weight we lost in the first semester? Prashant Mallick, Krishnas classmate in the fifth year of B. Arch at the School of Planning and Architecture, asks his friends, who nod in approbation.Even with familiar dishes here, vo baat nahi hai (something is amiss). Here, you get jalebis made of jaggery whereas back home its made of sugar. We survive only on chicken biryani, says U.P.-born Parag Raj Vaish, who became a non-vegetarian thanks to limited options available for vegetarians earlier.For Gaurav Das Swer, from Meghayala, finding mild flavours he is accustomed to is difficult. Only curd rice tastes homely, he quips.As for food trucks now lining up many roads to sell burgers, hot dogs and ice creams, Krishna attributes it to Pelli Choopulu , a 2016 romantic comedy film that made the concept popular.MNCs become popularThe students often flock to McDonalds, KFC and Subway, and refer, curiously, to items served by the multinational companies, which stepped into the city after the bifurcation, homely. Even local cafs offering Italian and Mediterranean dishes satiate them. But, for Vijendra Ranjilal, a Rajasthani who sells toys and balloons at the Benz Circle here, tiffin centres and small restaurants are yet to offer cheap cuisines familiar to him.Whenever I am in rush, I grab two samosas. Everything else tastes spicy, says Vijendra, of the Bagaria community, adding, I mostly prepare food at home. Even my neighbours ask for rotis I make.Even so, the city is beginning to welcome diverse tastes, says 47-year-old Poonam Mootha, a Rajasthani who grew up here. When I was in school, only Bhaiyaji Panipuri Walla in One Town sold North Indian street food. Now, you get pav bhaji and chole bhature everywhere.The change is more noticeable in terms of availability of non-regional fruits and vegetables to common people at Rythu Bazaars and with street vendors, says Karam Singh, a Punjabi who spent her early childhood here and has been in the city for 13 years as a consultant with an overseas education firm.I remember in my childhood when my father, returning from New Delhi, used to bring eggplants in sacks and distribute them among relatives fond of baingan bharta (mashed eggplant curry). Now, he doesnt have to do that. We now easily get carrots and radish too. Earlier, they were available only in supermarkets."

The focus so far has been on pushing agri-products into the Chinese market. Sensing that China would look first at its food security by diversifying imports in view of the trade war, New Delhi has stepped up its agro-diplomacy with Beijing.Over the past two months, Indian food and beverage producers have been conducting seminars and road shows in the Chinese capital.Soya sourceThough Indian soya bean exports are apparently a priority, especially after the China imposed a 25% levy on U.S. imports, success in the huge Chinese soya bean market is yet to materialise, though some progress may have registered during talks. Visiting Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan in a conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Shouwen earlier in November expressed satisfaction over progress on soya bean meal and pomegranate and related issues, an Indian Embassy press statement said.However, other agri-products may have stolen a march over soya beans in finding a niche in the Chinese market. On November 6, Jay Shree Tea and Industries Ltd. signed a $1-million black tea export contract with State-owned COFCO. Assam tea, in particular, has good prospects in China as it blends well with milk-based tea drinks. China has been traditionally a green tea market. But of late, its young people are developing a taste for milk infused bubble tea, potentially opening a larger market for Indian black teas, said Arun Kumar Ray, Deputy Chairman of the Tea Board, on a visit to Beijing.Indias efforts to export sugar to China, which began in earnest in June, also appear to have paid dividends. Earlier this month, a Commerce Ministry statement said the Indian Sugar Mills Association had signed its first sugar export contract of 50,000 tonnes with COFCO. During his visit, Mr. Wadhawan briefed the China Sugar Association about Indias proven capacity to meet Chinas sugar needs over the long haul.China has also opened up imports of non-Basmati rice from India in June on the sidelines of the Qingdao summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Officials say China is a lucrative $1.5-$2 billion market for Indian rice. A delegation of Indian rice traders was in Beijing in October on a follow-up visit after China, in principle, opened its doors to 24 India-based rice mills.Efforts to tap the Chinese agri-market, in view of the China-U.S. trade war, was flagged in April. In his opening remarks at the fifth China-India Strategic Economic Dialogue, NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said India was ready to step in and supply soya beans to China. I was noticing that there were some tariffs that were issued on farmers from Iowa and Ohio, etc. Maybe India can substitute for something like soya beans and sugar if we could have access to those exports with all the due quality considerations that you might have, Mr. Kumar had said.Trade imbalanceDespite signs of incremental progress, Indias $63-billion trade imbalance with China is alarming. In his meetings in Shanghai, Mr. Wadhawan stressed that pharmaceuticals, information technology services and tourism, in which India has a significant global footprint, had a minuscule presence in China.Earlier this year, India had raised the red flag about its adverse trade balance during Chinas trade policy review at the WTO, specifically citing hindrances that Indian exporters of rice, meat, pharmaceuticals and IT products were encountering to access the Chinese market.There are some positive developments... but we want that to be reflected in concrete trade figures before we can conclude that there has been a turnaround in our commercial ties with China, an Indian diplomat told The Hindu ."

The microbial consortium will help bring down pollution and will also increase fertility of the soil by adding nutrients, said NBRI director S K Barik.He said that four scientists, S K Tiwari, Poonam C Singh, Puneet Singh Chauhan and Suchi Srivastava were working on the microbial consortium and got results.It will be a double benefit technology as it will help to decompose crop residue left behind after harvest, said senior scientist Poonam C Singh.She said normally paddy stubble takes around 90 days for decomposition but the microbial consortium decomposed it in 30-45 days. The residue will be used to make rice straw pellets or cakes enriched with microbes for fast decomposition and plant growth promotion."

(Shutterstock)China, the largest importer of soybean, is likely to open its door for the oilseeds from India following a tariff war with the US. Beijing had recently allowed India to export non-basmati rice, rapeseed and raw sugar to meet its growing demand.The modalities to allow the export of soybeans to China is being worked out and an announcement from Beijing could be made very soon, a senior commerce ministry official said.Soybean is one of the items on which China imposed retaliatory duties of 25 per cent against the US in response to similar levies imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese products.The trade war is providing a window to the countrys agricultural products to enter the Chinese markets which will help reduce the trade deficit. The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling goods worth $250 billion, including bags, rice and textiles. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion, mostly chemicals, meat, wheat and wine.China had already cut import tariffs on soybean meals from Bangladesh, Laos, South Korea and Sri Lanka to prepare for more imports from these countries following its reduced purchases from the US. It is buying huge quantities from Brazil to meet its demand.Officials said quality inspectors from China are soon expected to visit India to inspect facilities.Beijing had imposed a ban on the import of soybean meals from India in 2012 over sanitary issues. India produces 10-11 million tonnes (mt) of soybean annually. Indias total soybean meal exports jumped to 2mt for oil year 2016-17 (October-September) from 320,000 tonnes the previous year.Expanding agricultural exports such as soybeans and cotton to China by exploiting opportunities from a global trade war will help cut the deficit, economists at Crisil said.Closely following soybeans is cotton. It puts India in a position to step up and fill the gap left by the US, economists Dharmakirti Joshi and Pankhuri Tandon said in a report.Amid expectations of exports to China, prices of the oilseeds in the country have started to firm up with soybean selling at 3,350 per quintal (per 100 kg) in wholesale markets in Maharashtra, the largest producer of the oilseeds. In the year-ago period, prices were ruling in the range of Rs 2,850 per quintal around the corresponding period. The prices may soon touch and surpass the MSP of Rs 3,399 per quintal set by the government, traders said.Globally, the US produces 40 per cent of the total production and India 4 per cent. The remaining is shared by countries such as Argentina, Brazil and others."
5ce6ac16e8e3fc56af4148d5,The sacred Indian games,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-sacred-indian-games/article25529137.ece,2018-11-18,"One evening, many years ago, my father asked if I would accompany him to a town in northern Kerala called Thirunavaya. The place was known, particularly among the Hindus of Malabar and Kodagu, for a small Vishnu temple. More importantly, it was famous as the place where one went to make offerings on behalf of ones ancestors, to ask of the cosmological order that release ( moksha ) be granted to them. In parts, this sanctity to Thirunavaya in the Hindu, and particularly the Vaishnavite, cosmos is bestowed by the river Bharathapuzha which flows by the temple, between the Vishnu temple on one bank and the Mahadeva and Brahma temples on the other. Alongside that slender but potentially perilous watery channel, like generations before, I sat on the gravelly steps leading down into the river.Like generations before me, wearing a ring made out of darbha grass and with balls of sesame and cooked rice laid in front, I too performed the pitru-tharpanam rituals. These were rituals in the name of those who had ceased to be. I invoked their spectral presence, reminisced about their life and histories, and asked the gods that their beings find release. Sitting there, as an observer and a participant, while the drone of the young priests voice rose and fell, I watched the river flow. The waters carried along with it refuse, debris, and residue to be poured out into the Arabian Sea near Ponnani. The river had survived sand mining mafias, invasive foreign species, chemicals  small and surreptitious abuses that wreck its ecosystem. All the while amidst the profane, natural and secular, the river made its way, unaware of the cosmological significance thrust upon it by humans.Sacred but pollutedThat Indian rivers have become sites where the sacred and the polluted coexist is not new. The Ganga is perhaps the pre-eminent example of this. In the summer of 1993 and 1994, during the course of her field work, the American anthropologist Kelly Alley, who now teaches at Auburn University in Alabama, asked the seemingly simple question of those who lived in Varanasi: How is it that a sacred river can be polluted? While she went about her investigation with compassion and rigour, the scepticism in her question was twofold: How can devotees let the river become polluted, and does the pollution itself not render the river less sacred? Variations on this theme had preoccupied the British colonisers as well, although their focus was inordinately on the macabre. (The Hindoo casts the dead naked into the sacred stream, wrote the authors of The Library of Entertaining Knowledge in the 1830s).When faced with the question of why a phenomenon or practice is held sacred, at the very end of that question often lie claims of civilisational epiphanies. This, in itself, is not unique to India. The scholar of myth and religions, Mircea Eliade (a student of Surendranath Dasgupta), wrote that sacrality bestowed on phenomena is, at its heart, an act of uncovering. Sacredness is the manifestation to all of what was a revelation to only a few. It is an act of what he calls hierophany (hiero: sacred; phany: to make visible). The great Martin Heidegger called this unconcealment of Being as aleitheia, as the truth of experience itself. Inevitably, like mushrooms after rains, stories follow that make the strangeness of hierophany palatable. In fact, according to the French sociologist Emile Durkheim, it is only by deeming some objects as sacred that societies can find reasons and means to cohere.But our lived lives sidestep such theorisations. Our rivers continue to be receptacles of our detritus and yet they remain as objects of veneration. Earlier last week, we saw photos of women, standing in the Yamuna and surrounded by chemical froth, performing the Chhath Puja. Unlike Islam or Christianity, which are abstemious in their relation to nature, the practice of Hinduism is intimately and extravagantly connected to the forests, plants, caves and rivers of India. These geographic features are not just instances of nature; rather, they become the locus of religion, the site where human consciousness acquires its Hindu identity via beliefs.An element of the schizoidWhat, then, happens to these beliefs, and inevitably identity, when these sources of sacrality are destroyed or polluted? We have found ways to make do, to coexist with ugliness, to ignore the discomfiting, and often to invent vocabularies that are elaborate and yet also expedient. The result is that there is an element of the schizoid, a sort of cognitive rupture: our beliefs about the sacred fail to correspond with our intuitions about sanctity. The more violent this rupture becomes, as India pollutes its way to middle-income status, the more strident will be efforts to insist on the sanctity of religious beliefs. At its extreme, our beliefs then become indistinguishable from mimicry."

The team was on a three-hour birdwatching trip in the Kadamakkudy area, which is home to almost 200 bird species, including winter migrants such as sandpipers and godwits that fly to India from as far as Europe and Siberia to escape the harsh winters of their temperate homes.We first thought it was a lesser whistling-duck, but our doubts were cleared when experts on the WhatsApp group of CNHS [Cochin Natural History Society] confirmed that it was a Ruddy shelduck, said Ms. Shaji, who is a final year postgraduate student of zoology.The team spotted only one individual of the species and have uploaded their bird list, including the sighting of the wild duck, on the online global citizen science website eBird.

Just four districts in the state recorded an almost 30% rise in crop fires while all the rest of the districts registered a decrease, eight districts by more than 25%, according to Indian satellite data with the government.The high number of crop fires  57,756 as per Nasa data till November 15 in Punjab and Haryana this year as compared with 55,404 last year  suggests the PMs Rs 1,151-crore package for management of paddy residues failed to make a dent this year.At the same time, the large variation in stubble-burning incidents, particularly within Punjab, indicates that several factors were in play, some that led to a spurt in burning as well as others that worked in reducing fires.The four districts where burning increased this year are Ferozepur (up 42%), Muktsar (38%), Moga (14%) and Bathinda (12%), as per figures collated till November 12 by the Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute (ATARI), Ludhiana. Together, these four districts alone accounted for 40% of fire events in the state, up from 29% last year. All four districts are in the western Malwa region of the state where kisan unions are strong, said a state agriculture department official.The unions have been demanding cash compensation of Rs 200 per acre to farmers for not burning stubble. In many areas, the unions ensured that farmers burned stubble in support of the demand, said a state agriculture department official.Political factors cant be ruled out as some of these areas are Akali strongholds, the official added.Time too played a big part in fuelling fires across Punjab. Rice sowing started late and harvesting was delayed by rains in October, leaving many farmers with a very small window to prepare the fields for the rabi (winter) crop.Each days delay in sowing of wheat after November 15 decreases yields by an average of 30kg per hectare. Pressed for time, many farmers opted to burn the paddy residue, said M L Jat from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), an international research organisation that promotes sustainable agriculture in the region in collaboration with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research and other bodies.TOI travelled through Karnal (in Haryana) and Ludhiana, and farmers in both districts said the respective state governments did not crack down on stubble-burning by imposing challans, particularly when the fires were peaking in November.In the midst of these failures, there was heartening news as well. Outside of the four Punjab districts and Sirsa in Haryana, all places reported a reduction in crop-burning, as per data released by ATARI.Among areas that see heavy stubble-burning, Kapurthala (down 53%), Ludhiana (46%), Jalandhar (37%) and Karnal (45%) saw impressive reduction in fires. In many of these areas, in-situ residue management techniques like the use of happy seeders have been increasing in the past two years.In Taraori village in Karnal, for instance, farmers said roughly 100 acres out of 2,000 saw burning this year. The village has farmers such as Vikas Chaudhry and Manoj Kumar who have been using happy seeders for the past six years.Farmers from the village and neighbouring areas have been coming to us to look at how in situ management works and have seen the results. Most of them have now adopted these techniques, said Chaudhry.Punjab agriculture commissioner B S Sidhu agreed that large-scale demonstration of in situ techniques was needed, along with training for personnel to handhold farmers making the transition to burning-free agriculture.We plan to take up these activities on a wide scale in the coming year. We are sure we will reduce stubble-burning significantly next year, Sidhu said.Meanwhile, this years burning season is expected to end in a few days, with just around 10-15% of rice harvesting yet to be done, officials said."

I was told we dont need another IP since we already have a 3qt mini. I couldnt take it anymore. I sneaked away and bought the Black Friday 6qt Instant Pot. Then I hid it away in storage so no one will know yet. Chrysta Broussard sent out this Facebook post on November 15 to 1.5 million members on the Instant Pot Community. This is just one of the many Facebook pages dedicated to a gadget that has transformed home cooking. And Indian cooks are embracing the product from a Canada-based company.Instant Pot, whats that?Its an electric cooker which can work like a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, warming pot, saute pan, steamer and yoghurt maker. Plug the device in and press a preset button or go for the manual setting button, which allows one to adjust the time and pressure level. The technology involved is not very different from that of a pressure or slow cooker. This one runs on electricity and instead of using too many pans, you can do several things inside one device.Archana Mundhes The Essential Indian Instant Pot Cookbook is a popular buy on Amazon Source: AmazonRobert Wang is a former home cook, with a PhD in computer science who rarely found time to make healthy meals for his wife and two children Source: Double Insight siteIs it a new gadget?No. The Instant Pot debuted in the US in 2009-10 but by then electric pressure cookers were already popular in China. Its inventor, Robert Wang, 53, started with around 50 employees and almost zero spending on advertisements. Amazon turned this small business into an overnight success. According to a profile in The New York Times, the former home cook, with a PhD in computer science, rarely found time to make healthy meals for his wife and two children. This is when he recruited two other engineers and spent 18 months and $350,000 of his savings developing a high-tech device that would combine pressure-cooking, slow-cooking, sauteing and other common cooking functions in a single appliance.Though kitchen appliances come and go, the Instant Pot is still going strong and even a major appliance maker like Cuisinart now has electric multicookers of its own. In India, one can get the real deal on Amazon.in but at a price of Rs 16,715. Too much? There are options like Redmonds digital pressure multicooker that comes for around Rs 10,000 and Preethis electric pressure cooker, which comes for around Rs 5,500.Urvashi Pitres Easy Chicken Korma from her book Indian Instant Pot Cookbook Source: Urvashi PitreIs it good for Indian recipes?Yes, and there are plenty of cookbooks around it, like Archana Mundhes The Essential Indian Instant Pot Cookbook with recipes like Chickpea Curry, Butter Chicken and Fig and Walnut Halwa. Also popular is Indian Instant Pot, by Urvashi Pitre, which has recipes like Easy Chicken Korma and Chana Masala. And coming in 2019 is Madhur Jaffreys Essential Indian Instant Pot Cookbook."

The proposal is part of the Green City-Clean City project that can make room for apartments with all modern facilities. ""The city will look better once the project in place with accommodation facilities for many,"" the CM added.Mamata has already asked the state urban development department to prepare a project blueprint. Residents here will get a bonus as hospitality and healthcare facilities have already applied for land in the area, which has a state-of-the-art convention centre Soujanya, along with an open air theatre Uttirna. A 2,000 seater auditorium Dhana Dhanya is coming up in the neighbourhood. The National Library and Alipore Horticulture Garden are two landmarks of the area.The proposal has come as a windfall for real estate developers. The unlocking of the idle asset will also fetch big revenue for the government as land price in this locality is over Rs 1 crore a cottah. The CM during inauguration of the Soujanya convention centre a fortnight ago had told the audience that she has start 4ed identifying idle assets in the city and will draw up a plan for the city's beautification.Nandu Belani, president of the Bengal chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), welcomed the development.""The idea to have a real estate project cashing in on an idle asset is a sound move,"" Belani said. However, he and other realtors were unwilling to comment on the proposal to shift Alipore Zoo as the area was a green zone and attempts to develop it would court unnecessary controversy.The CM announced the proposal soon after the first lot of 50 convicts from Alipore Central Correctional Home entered Baruipur Central Correctional Home on Wednesday. The convicts, some of whom have spent upto 35 years at Alipore jail , were brought to their new home at Baruipur.Among the 50 are Md. Nasib alais Naso who has been serving a life term for the last 35 years for the 1984 murder of DC port of Kolkata Police. Another lifer, Siddique Sardar of Bhangor, has so far served 16 years at Alipore for getting his wife murdered by a hired killer after he suspected her of having an extra-marital affair. Sardar wrote his M.A. exam from jail in 2010 and passed. Bird-lover Sankar Jaswara, also a lifer, has served 21 years at Alipore jail for murder. Seven months ago, Jaswara rescued an injured bird after a storm from within the Alipore jail yard. He was released on parole soon after and took the bird to a veterinary doctor for treatment.The CM inaugurated the new jail by pressing a button from her office at Nabanna. The convicts apart, Assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, state jails minister Ujjal Biswas and director-general (jails) Arun Gupta were present at Baruipur. ""More convicts will be brought to the Baruipur jail from Alipore in phases,"" said Gupta. The inauguration was followed by a cultural function at which some convicts also performed.The inauguration marks the opening of the first phase of the Baruipur jail project. ""Work on the second phase will hopefullybe completed by March-end,"" added Gupta. While the first project's first phase was built at a cost of Rs 70 crores, the second phase is coming up with an allocation of Rs 98 crores.The new jail has a hygienic kitchen and toilets. The kitchen is equipped with modern machines like large cookers for rice and rotis. Explaining the facilities, a jail official said, ""The new jail will also have an upgraded security arrangement. For instance, the boundary wall of the jail is 25 feet high compared to Alipore jail's 20 feet boundary. Moreover, there is another 15 feet wall around this wall, acting as a second security ring with several watchtowers all around to prevent prisoners from escaping. There are many more CCTV cameras to keep an eye on prisoners."

5ce6d8f6e8e3fc56af415788,Food security does not equal good nutrition,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/food-security-does-not-equal-good-nutrition/cid/1675213,2018-11-15,"One is what one eats. A study by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization confirms that poor-quality diet poses a greater threat to public health across the world than malaria, tuberculosis or measles and that diet-related factors account for six of the top nine ailments on the global burden of disease. This is worrying for India is home to no less than 196 million people with chronic undernourishment. Yet, it is a food secure nation; efforts at improving access to food and nutrition are led by the National Food Security Act, not to mention the special nutritional schemes for women and children like mid-day meals. Why then are Indias masses undernourished? The first hurdle  as with everything else  is corruption. The porous nature of the public distribution system ensures that actual beneficiaries end up getting only part of the allotted quantity of provisions. Even what is distributed is of an inferior quality. Then, measures to check such discrepancies end up reinforcing exclusion. Take, for instance, the Aadhaar scheme; thousands have been deprived of basic necessities because they do not have a unique identity card, often because of bureaucratic and technological failures. Another obstacle is wastage  61,824 tonnes of foodgrains were reportedly damaged between 2011 and 2017, enough to feed around eight lakh people for an entire year. There is also the thoughtless imposition of majoritarian beliefs like keeping eggs out of mid-day meals.The problem of undernutrition, however, goes deeper. In India, food security  largely owing to the push of the Green Revolution  is imagined in terms of rice and wheat. This has changed consumption patterns. Coarse grains  historically seen as food of the underprivileged  have disappeared from the plates and the fields. Low prices have not helped their cause either. Yet, coarse grains are packed with nutrition, containing high levels of iron, calcium and even protein. These are also water efficient and climate resilient. Introducing coarse grains into the PDS can go a long way towards tackling problems like anaemia, which affects more than half of all women and children under the age of five in India. This will require time and a comprehensive approach, including a rethinking of agricultural policies. The traditional attitude to food security has been to promote staples like grains, tubers and other starchy food, contributing to the twin burden of malnutrition  undernourishment and obesity. The focus must now shift to improving the nutritional value of meals."

It was Tamil Nadu that showed the way to other States on at least two welfare schemes  the mid-day meal programme and social security or old age pension.An information guide, published by the Director of Information and Public Relations in February 2017, gives an indication of the significance of the welfare state in Tamil Nadu. The guide runs to 585 pages, covering a host of welfare schemes being implemented by 31 government departments.The State has a wide variety of welfare schemes, ranging from the provision of bicycles free-of-cost to students, free rice through the public distribution system (PDS) to about 1.8 crore familiesand marriage assistance schemes to free bus passes for senior citizens living in Chennai.Between 2006 and 2016, successive governments  of the DMK and the AIADMK  took the policy on subsidies to a whole new level. While the DMK government (2006-11) distributed 1.64 crore colour TV sets free-of-cost at an outlay of Rs. 3,687 crore, the AIADMK regime, between 2011 and 2016, gave away 1.75 crore fans, mixies and grinders at a cost of Rs. 7,686.21 crore.Though the film seemed to advocate an outright rejection of freebies (the scenes in question have since been removed), economists, commentators and policy-makers do not share that position.Need to distinguishEmphasising the need for distinguishing schemes aimed at providing essential services or commodities from those that offer consumer durables, Paul Appasamy, veteran economist, says the former has made a meaningful difference to the quality of life of the poor, whereas the latter has often received public attention, for all the wrong reasons, as the quality of goods provided has been poor at times. He is for the adoption of direct benefit transfer so that deserving persons are covered, and the scope for leakages and diversion reduced. He underlines that it is due to the States track record in the implementation of welfare schemes that it has become known for its extremely low rate of multidimensional poverty, which covers three parameters  health, education and living standards.R. Thangathurai, commentator, recalls that when former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran launched the mid-day meal programme in 1982, the move came in for derision. But the programme eventually became a big hit. Mr. Thangathurai does not view the colour TV scheme as one of wasteful expenditure as, he argues, television has become a powerful instrument of information and entertainment to the lower strata of society.Strongly defending the schemes on bicycles and laptops for students, G. Palanithurai, former professor at the Gandhigram Rural Institute, , says they have empowered students, especially girls.K.R. Shanmugam, Director, Madras School of Economics, points out that the State government is providing subsidies to industrial units too, and hence, the issue should be considered in its totality.Several policy-makers have hinted that it is time for the State to shift to a targeted approach to providing subsidies. As a case in point, 100 units of electricity are being provided to domestic consumers free-of-cost every two months, costing Rs. 2,000 crore annually. This can easily be streamlined, they say."

To mark the occasion, a specially curated evening of Italian Gastronomy  Il Tavola Italiano, was organised. We spoke to the two Italian chefs -- Piero Ditrizio and Simone de SiatoWhat is a typical meal like in an Italian home?Simone: When it comes to Italian cuisine, regions have major roles to play. Everything we eat at home is totally dominated by the region we are in.Piero: In the south of Italy people eat a lot of eggplant. You will find heavy use of olive oil in the southern part, whereas in the north, the use of butter is more. So food varies according to the region. Nowadays you will find chefs creating and fusing different regions in the food they make but predominantly, Italian cuisine is about following and sticking to tradition.What are the must-have ingredients in Italian cuisine?Simone: Tomato, olive oil, basil, parmesan, balsamic vinegar, mascarpone and pasta. One of the most prominent features of the cuisine is that everything is fresh, so that you get the real taste of the ingredients. South of Italy uses a lot of rice while the use of wheat is more in the northern region. One thing common to both the regions is tomato.What lies behind the appeal of Italian cuisine?Piero: Italian cuisine is quite simple. The ingredients are low-fat and theres no overcooking involved. Olive oil is good for health. The use of butter is minimal.What are the different kinds of pasta?Simone: There are more than 100 varieties! This again depends on the region. You can make 10 different types of pasta with a single dough. Making pasta is something we learn at home as a child. Everything is handmade, rolled by hand too. There are two main types  fresh and dry. Dry pasta is industrial pasta. Its made with semolina flour and the quality of semolina is very important. If the texture of the pasta is smooth, it isnt good. It should be a little rough so that it can retain the sauce. The temperature at which pasta is dried is important too. Pasta should be dried at a low temperature. The more time it takes for the pasta to dry, the more time it takes to cook and the better is the mouthfeel. Fresh pasta is anyway rough because its handmade.Do Italian families bond over cooking?Piero: Family is something that plays an important role, it forms the base. Recipes from grandmothers and mothers are preserved in Italian households. The traditional recipes are important to us, be it for pastas or pastries.

It's a different technology than today's controversial ""genetically modified"" foods, more like faster breeding that promises to boost nutrition, spur crop growth, and make farm animals hardier and fruits and vegetables last longer.The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has declared gene editing one of the breakthroughs needed to improve food production so the world can feed billions more people amid a changing climate. Yet governments are wrestling with how to regulate this powerful new tool. And after years of confusion and rancor, will shoppers accept gene-edited foods or view them as GMOs in disguise?""If the consumer sees the benefit, I think they'll embrace the products and worry less about the technology,"" said Dan Voytas, a University of Minnesota professor and chief science officer for Calyxt Inc., which edited soybeans to make the oil heart-healthy.Researchers are pursuing more ambitious changes: Wheat with triple the usual fiber, or that's low in gluten. Mushrooms that don't brown, and better-producing tomatoes. Drought-tolerant corn, and rice that no longer absorbs soil pollution as it grows. Dairy cows that don't need to undergo painful de-horning, and pigs immune to a dangerous virus that can sweep through herds.Scientists even hope gene editing eventually could save species from being wiped out by devastating diseases like citrus greening, a so far unstoppable infection that's destroying Florida's famed oranges.First they must find genes that could make a new generation of trees immune.""If we can go in and edit the gene, change the DNA sequence ever so slightly by one or two letters, potentially we'd have a way to defeat this disease,"" said Fred Gmitter, a geneticist at the University of Florida Citrus Research and Education Center, as he examined diseased trees in a grove near Fort Meade.GENETICALLY MODIFIED OR EDITED, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?Farmers have long genetically manipulated crops and animals by selectively breeding to get offspring with certain traits. It's time-consuming and can bring trade-offs. Modern tomatoes, for example, are larger than their pea-sized wild ancestor, but the generations of cross-breeding made them more fragile and altered their nutrients.GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, are plants or animals that were mixed with another species' DNA to introduce a specific trait  meaning they're ""transgenic."" Best known are corn and soybeans mixed with bacterial genes for built-in resistance to pests or weed killers.Despite international scientific consensus that GMOs are safe to eat, some people remain wary and there is concern they could spur herbicide-resistant weeds.Now gene-editing tools, with names like CRISPR and TALENs, promise to alter foods more precisely, and at less cost, without necessarily adding foreign DNA. Instead, they act like molecular scissors to alter the letters of an organism's own genetic alphabet.The technology can insert new DNA, but most products in development so far switch off a gene, according to University of Missouri professor Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes.Those new Calyxt soybeans? Voytas' team inactivated two genes so the beans produce oil with no heart-damaging trans fat and that shares the famed health profile of olive oil without its distinct taste.The hornless calves? Most dairy Holsteins grow horns that are removed for the safety of farmers and other cows. Recombinetics Inc. swapped part of the gene that makes dairy cows grow horns with the DNA instructions from naturally hornless Angus beef cattle.""Precision breeding,"" is how animal geneticist Alison Van Eenennaam of the University of California, Davis, explains it. ""This isn't going to replace traditional breeding,"" but make it easier to add one more trait.RULES AREN'T CLEARThe Agriculture Department says extra rules aren't needed for ""plants that could otherwise have been developed through traditional breeding,"" clearing the way for development of about two dozen gene-edited crops so far.In contrast, the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 proposed tighter, drug-like restrictions on gene-edited animals. It promises guidance sometime next year on exactly how it will proceed.Because of trade, international regulations are ""the most important factor in whether genome editing technologies are commercialized,"" USDA's Paul Spencer told a meeting of agriculture economists.Europe's highest court ruled last summer that existing European curbs on the sale of transgenic GMOs should apply to gene-edited foods, too.But at the World Trade Organization this month, the U.S. joined 12 nations including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil in urging other countries to adopt internationally consistent, science-based rules for gene-edited agriculture.ARE THESE FOODS SAFE?The biggest concern is what are called off-target edits, unintended changes to DNA that could affect a crop's nutritional value or an animal's health, said Jennifer Kuzma of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University.Scientists are looking for any signs of problems. Take the hornless calves munching in a UC-Davis field. One is female and once it begins producing milk, Van Eenennaam will test how similar that milk's fat and protein composition is to milk from unaltered cows.""We're kind of being overly cautious,"" she said, noting that if eating beef from naturally hornless Angus cattle is fine, milk from edited Holsteins should be, too.But to Kuzma, companies will have to be up-front about how these new foods were made and the evidence that they're healthy. She wants regulators to decide case-by-case which changes are no big deal, and which might need more scrutiny.""Most gene-edited plants and animals are probably going to be just fine to eat. But you're only going to do yourself a disservice in the long run if you hide behind the terminology,"" Kuzma said.AVOIDING A BACKLASHUncertainty about regulatory and consumer reaction is creating some strange bedfellows. An industry-backed group of food makers and farmers asked university researchers and consumer advocates to help craft guidelines for ""responsible use"" of gene editing in the food supply.""Clearly this coalition is in existence because of some of the battle scars from the GMO debates, there's no question about that,"" said Greg Jaffe of the food-safety watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest, who agreed to join the Center for Food Integrity's guidelines group. ""There's clearly going to be questions raised about this technology.""SUSTAINABILITY OR HYPE?Gene-editing can't do everything, cautioned Calyxt's Voytas. There are limitations to how much foods could be changed. Sure, scientists made wheat containing less gluten, but it's unlikely to ever be totally gluten-free for people who can't digest that protein, for example  or to make, say, allergy-free peanuts.Nor is it clear how easily companies will be able to edit different kinds of food, key to their profit.Despite her concerns about adequate regulation, Kuzma expects about 20 gene-edited crops to hit the U.S. market over five years  and she notes that scientists also are exploring changes to crops, like cassava, that are important in the poorest countries.""We think it's going to really revolutionize the industry,"" she said."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityBHOPAL: Mahakoshal region spanning across eight districts - from Balaghat on one end to Katni at another- culturally and politically does not come across as unary as is a case with Vindhya, Malwa or Nimar region.The eight districts- Jabalpur , Katni, Narsinghpur, Seoni, Balaghat, Dindori, Mandla and Chhindwara - present quite a different picture.With the BJP and Congress state chiefs coming from Mahakoshal region, electoral battle between the two parties assumed greater importance. While Kamal Nath's claim to the post of chief minister would obviously get a boost, if party fares better on 38 seats of the region, Singh's political stature would rise phenomenally if BJP retains its ground in Mahakoshal or betters it further.Jabalpur, often referred as ""Sanskardhani,"" in pre-Independence era remained under Imperial rule for many long years. A hub of education in the state for long in the past saw medical college as far back as in 1955 before losing out the tag to Bhopal or Indore . The famous Robertson College came up in Jabalpur as early as 1873, attesting to its importance in ample measures. The Cantonment area with old British-style bungalows in lush greenery lends a different charm to the city.Katni is rich in minerals and one of the mining barons Sanjay Pathak who represents the seat- was elected on Congress ticket in 2008, but went over to BJP in the mid-term and is now a minister in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan's council of ministers.Narsinghpur, which of late has been in news for unrest among sugarcane-producing farmers and Congress has been trying to fish in the troubled water to consolidate its position in the district.Then, there is a vast tribal belt in the area known as eastern tribal belt of MP while western belt is dominated by aggressive Bhils, eastern belt has Gond tribals in majority, who are quiet by temperament. The area has been ruled by a clutch of Gond kings and legendary Rani Durgavati after whom Jabalpur University is named, was also a Gond queen. They have also been trying to come up as a political force in the area, but political outfit formed for the purpose - Gondwana Gantantra Party (GGP)- has failed them so far.Balaghat is famous for bamboos, zinc mining and quality rice production. Besides lurking fear of Naxalites using the place as a hide-out. However, they have not carried out any major operation in the district after alleged killing of Likhiram Kanware, a minister in the erstwhile Digvijaya Singh government. Yet, voting in the district ends far earlier than other places in the state so as to avoid any chance to Naxalites to strike during polling. Chief minister's brother-in-law Sanjay Singh Masani taking to electoral field on Congress ticket from Waraseoni has added extra spice to election in the region. Nath's constituency is also part of this tribal belt and three out of seven assembly seats in the district are reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST).As far as electoral history of the region-which had Congress fortunes plummeting to a new low in 2003 with the party restricted to five seats as against 32 of the BJP saw ""grand old party"" making sort of a comeback in 2008 election with Congress raising its tally to 16 as against 22 of the BJP. But in 2013 election, it was again reduced to 13 and BJP tally rose to 25.Gondwana Gantantra Party (GGP), which burst on the political scene by winning three assembly seats in 2003, could not make repeat performance in next two elections. And all the three seats it had won were not from Mandla or Dindori constituencies having 57% and 64% tribal population, but from Chhindwara, Seoni and Balaghat, respectively. Incidentally, in this election, Congress failed to get even a single seat out of seven in Kamal Nath's bastion Chhindwara. GGP, which split into three groups after 2003 elections, is regrouping and is hoping to recover lost ground in an alliance with Samajwadi Party (SP).(With inputs from Siddharth Pandey)"

Its the comfort food that would lift your spirits in an acrimonious world.Sandwiched between Mauritius and Africa, this paradise isle has mountains, valleys, sandy beaches, pristine blue seas and vertiginous falls. But more than the natural beauty, it is the people of the island that give it its distinctive characteristics.The paradise isle has mountains, valleys, sandy beaches, pristine blue seas and vertiginous falls Image: Sudha PillaiAnd people of Indian origin  about 45 per cent of the total population of 837,000 inhabitants  are shining testimonies to this amalgamation.How they came to be thereThe island, formed from a volcanic rising five million years ago, was first discovered by Arab traders. Soon the invaders -- Portuguese, British and the French -- arrived. Finally, the French colonised it, and christened it Reunion Island in 1793.An apt name for what the island is today, if not historically accurate.The island was formed from a volcanic rising five million years ago Image: Sudha PillaiReunion Island began as a place where prisoners were left to die. But the prisoners started living idyllic lives  swimming in the sea, climbing mountains, growing rice, vegetables and fruits in the fertile volcanic soil. After all, the island has 300 micro-climates.The French decided to reclaim this paradise for themselves. First they brought Africans here as slaves for the sugarcane plantations. After slavery was abolished, they fetched indentured workers from India.And that is how the Indian community started out on this unlikely island.Mary Theresa SubramaniamI met Mary Theresa Subramaniam at the Saint-Pierre market, where shes been working for the past 30 years. Marys great-grandfather came to the island with his wife and nine children. But he abandoned them and returned to India. His young wife raised her children in a foreign land.Clad in a skirt and lavender top, Mary has distinctive South Indian features. Shes never visited India. She believes she may have a few relatives back in India but has no clue about their whereabouts. This is also a typical story amongst the Indian community here.Mary is both a Hindu and a Christian. And there are many like her on the island Image: Sudha PillaiMary is both a Hindu and a Christian. And there are many like her on the island.When the Hindu Indians got off the boat two things happened at the immigration office. First, their names were Frenchified. Mary says, The immigration officers couldnt get the Indian names right. Vaidyalingam became Vaitilingam, Arumugam became Aroumougam, and so on.Second, they were asked to embrace Christianity. Due to the fear of retribution, they embraced it and a few continued to practise Hinduism secretly. Over time, the lines between faiths blurred. When Reunion Islands embraced religious diversity, most Indian families found themselves both Christian and Hindu.Priest BalaramA short walk from the market is the Mahakali de Bazaar or the Mahakali temple. Mahakali Utsav and Tamil New Years Day are big celebrations on the island.Tall and lanky Balaram, who can trace his roots back to Pondicherry, is the presiding priest at the Mahakali temple. He is, like most Indians here, fluent in French. Because that is what we speak at home, he says. Balarams great-grandfather came to Reunion Island. He is one of the few Indians on the island who still has some connection to India. Every year he goes to Munjod, a village in Kanjeepuram, to study Sanskrit.Balaram, the presiding priest at the Mahakali temple, speaks French at home Image: Sudha PillaiOn the island, Indians from South India, often Hindu, are known as Malbars. Immigrants from North India came later. Muslim Indians from North India are known as Zarabes.Temples and mosques - the first mosque of France was built here - stand alongside churches. Nowhere is this intermingling of faiths more evident than in the pretty cemeteries. At the St-Pierre Cemetery, amidst decorative family vaults and single graves with cherubs on tombstones, I found numerous graves of Indian-origin Christians. They had a saffron-coloured Trishul-cross combo on the headstones. This was the best religious khichdi I had ever seen.Tombstones of Indian origin Christians at the St-Pierre Cemetery Image: Sudha PillaiJacky ArourmougamMany elements of India are integrated into the weave of the island. But the influence of Indian cuisine stands out. Jacky Arourmougam, a celebrity chef on the Island, says, About 80 percent of Creole food is inspired by India. Rice and lentils are staples along with croissants and baguettes. Samoussas or Samosa is the undisputed national dish.I enjoyed an outdoor picnic at Trou deau at La Saline Les Bains with Jacky. His forefathers hail from Bengal and South India. Some of his unique dishes are inspired by the secret recipes of his mother and grandmother who came from Bengal. When the French-sounding achhard is placed on the table, you realise it is but the spicy Indian achaar and that kurkuma is turmeric which is used extensively in the island cuisine. And chicken cari draws heavily from the Indian curry. No doubt, the mingling of communities has given Reunion Island its unique food culture.Celebrity chef Jacky Arourmougam is inspired by the recipes of his mother and grandmother who came from Bengal Image: Sudha PillaiFor most Indians in Reunion Island, their acquaintance with India has been through faded stories of their ancestors travelling through the family vine or the banyan and mango trees in the backyard, the seeds of which were brought to the island by their forefathers or the recipes that are carefully passed down from great-great-grandmothers. While few Indian-islanders desire to travel to India, most of them are indifferent to the distant association. Reunion Island is where they feel rooted. Its not that they shun their past. It is just that they prefer to live in the present."

It is the only Hindu festival dedicated to Sun God. In Chandigarh, a gathering of over 1 lakh people is witnessed at the Sector 42 artificial lake alone, thus making it one of the grand affairs in the city. The festivity is being organised by Purvanchal Welfare Association in Chandigarh.Considered very auspicious by families residing in Purvanchal region, the festival commenced on Sunday with the ritual 'Nahaye-Khaye' and will go on till Wednesday morning with various rituals lined in between.The preparations of the festival however begins right after Diwali with people avoiding everything that might bring negativities into their homes. They do not even eat garlic and onion in their meals. Though the fast of Chhath Puja is very long there are special cuisines which are cooked for the righteous completion of the fast. The Chhath Puja fast begins with a traditional meal which is considered to be very pure.For making all the cuisines, new utensils are bought and new ingredients are brought so that the food cooked remains pure. On Sunday, people decorated their homes and all those fasting then cooked lauki (bottle gourd) in desi ghee , rice and chana dal.""This is a traditional food which is considered pure,"" said PN Shahi, a Purvanchal resident living in Chandigarh for several decades. After eating this meal no food is eaten.On Monday, a special meal, Kharna will be prepared. People fast for all day long and in the evening, the one who is fasting cooks kheer and roti as parsad and distribute it amongst friends and relatives, shared shahi. This kheer is made up of rice, sugarcane gur and milk and is eaten with roti's with ghee on them. It is said that this meal fulfils the wish of the people who make it and the people who eats it. That is why people from far away places visit relative's house to eat kheer and roti. This is also the last meal for those fasting. After this they eat after two days of continuous fasting.On Tuesday, people will fast all day long and in the evening they would gather at Sector 42 lake and offer water to the sun. With this the first step of Chhath Puja will end. Last year, nearly 1 lakh people visited the lake on this day. People from Zirakpur, Panchkula and Mohali also visit the lake.On Wednesday, which would be the last day of the Chhath Puja, people would gather at the lake at the 3.00am onwards to offer water to the sun along with all kinds of fruits available in the market, including sugarcane."

For Mma Farm, spread over 100 acres at the Dalma wildlife sanctuary, carved a niche for itself ever since it reached organic vegetables and milk produced in local villages to urban homes here through its portal www.mmawithlove.com in 2016.With proven expertise in supplying organic milk and vegetables to homes, Mma Farm has the resources to start this unique breakfast venture on a pilot basis, added Singh, who is part of the XLRI team that is collaborating with Mma Farm.Sharma promised an interesting menu that would keep changing so that children dont get bored.After the pilot run people can chose their menu on the portal. There will be a wide range, like, say, idli and vada made from organic batter from rice and dal grown at our farm. We will use power oil, which is light and has Omega 3. It is made from mustard and linseed grown in our farm, he said, adding that the selection will also include sandwiches made of organic vegetables, poha, paratha, dosa, dhokla, fresh juice, dahi vada, curd, corn chat, fruit salad and sprouts.In Jamshedpur, Mma Farm provides pure milk from Dutch cows that munch on fresh organic feed grown in Dalma, and organic vegetables that are grown using cow dung-based vermicompost. One can buy milk and vegetables by emailing order@mmawithlove.com or calling 9031730990.Mma Farm has adopted five villages of the Dalma sanctuary for five years. It has employed over 5,000 villagers in the project. Fifty per cent of its earnings (sale from products) go towards improving the health, education and living standards of local residents.We are planning to employ war widows or other needy women as cooks. They will be trained to work as chefs at our distribution hubs that will be set up at Baridih, Kadma, Sonari, Circuit House (Bistupur) and Adityapur. We hope to roll out the project by mid-November, Sharma said, adding that they would start visiting schools and homes to inform parents about the health benefits of the project."

Pune district has 17 tribal schools across five tehsils  Ambegaon Junnar , Khed, Maval, and Bhor. At least 3,000 tribal students study at these schools currently. The tribal development department had received complaints of dirty washrooms, no electricity, no benches for students, no warm water supply, among others.The squads will submit a school-wise report by the first week of December. We will forward their reports to the government so as to upgrade the infrastructure at schools, state tribal commissioner Kiran Kulkarni told TOI on Saturday.An official from the department added that the squads would aim to discuss infrastructural issues with the concerned school headmasters and other staff member s.Our endeavour is to provide better infrastructures to each school in the state. In fact, several schools have decent facilities in place, Kulkarni said.However, social activists and a section of department officials said that the schools are facing numerous issues that need to be addressed at the earliest. Sandeep Sable, chairman of the Integrated Tribal Development Project at Ghodegaon, recently visited tribal schools in Ambegaon. He shared, These schools do not even have basic infrastructure. There are no CCTV cameras to ensure security. We have raised these issues with the concerned authorities in the past but we are yet to get a response.As per rules, every tribal school must have a computer centre but, in the case of most schools in Ghodegaon, the computers do not work, Sable added.The Tribal English Medium School at Ghodegaon does not have a computer laboratory or a science laboratory. Even the library has very few books. Students and their parents have often protested over these matters but in vain, he said.Further, he pointed out that the tribal schools are supposed to provide nutritious food comprising fruits, vegetables, milk, bread, rice and roti, but several institutes do not have adequate kitchen facilities.Many kitchens at schools in Pune district were unhygienic. At some places, we even saw heaps of garbage near the kitchen. The quality of rice was poor. There was no supply of fruits or eggs. Students were being served the same menu every meal through the week. The government needs to equip kitchens with proper furniture to preserve foodgrain, said Sable, who has received at least 30 food-related complaints over the last 10 months."

5ce6fa4ae8e3fc56af416589,Is genetically modified food really safe?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/is-genetically-modified-food-really-safe/cid/1674765,2018-11-11,"GM technology  involving the introduction of foreign genetic material (transgenics) or editing of genes  used to alter the genome of plants and create what are called genetically modified organisms (GMOs) (Thinkstock)A few months ago, researchers of the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) chanced upon something quite alarming while testing samples of breakfast cereals, infant food, edible oils and other food products at their state-of-the-art laboratory in Nimli, Rajasthan. Their sensitive qPCR instrument reported the presence of genetically modified (GM) ingredients in almost one-third of these samples  80 per cent of these GM-positive samples were imported. Yet there was almost nothing on the labels to indicate the presence of GM ingredients, some were even labelled GM-free! Their report made headlines but was quickly forgotten, despite the serious health implications for every consumer. Incidentally, the legal and regulatory framework in this country does not allow GM crops to be commercially cultivated or imported without labelling and approvals.GM technology  involving the introduction of foreign genetic material (transgenics) or editing of genes  used to alter the genome of plants and create what are called genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is fraught with risks. This is because among other things, no independent, long-term study on the effect on human health have been done which proves beyond doubt that GM food is safe for human consumption. While researching my recent novel on eco-disaster, The Butterfly Effect, and as an environment campaigner earlier, I have closely studied the material put out by those who support GMOs as well as the reasons for countering such optimism.It is well-known that powerful multinational corporations control the global business of GM crops. As expected, the pro-GMO camp has come up with a variety of justifications to push this technology into the market. The Geneticliteracyproject.org website, citing an analysis of 1,783 studies on the safety and environmental impacts of GM food, goes on to state, the researchers couldnt find a single credible example demonstrating that GM foods pose any harm to humans or animals.The Hyderabad-based Centre for Sustainable Agriculture points out in its fact book that the tests conducted for approval of GM crops are usually performed on rats, whose lifespan is not comparable to humans. In fact, there are numerous studies pointing to adverse impacts of GMOs. One such compilation is available on the Coalition for a GM-Free India website.The threats from GM food in particular and GMOs in general, as outlined by researchers and activists alike, are manifold. There are well-argued health, environmental and economic reasons to be wary of these so-called Frankenfoods. The American Academy of Environmental Medicine lists infertility, immune problems, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulation and changes in organs among possible risks from GM food.There exists a multilateral framework to regulate the transboundary movement and use of GMOs, outlined in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Cartagena Protocol repeatedly invokes the precautionary approach in its goal to protect biological diversity and human health, which essentially holds that the lack of scientific certainty shouldnt prevent control measures on products and technologies which pose a threat.Golden Rice was developed to combat Vitamin A deficiency. But there are simpler dietary alternatives. (Thinkstock)India has established a regulatory and legal framework involving bodies like the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and laws relating to environment, food safety, legal metrology and foreign trade to control the production, cultivation, release and import of GMOs. Till date, not a single GM produce that is to be used as food has been approved for commercial cultivation.So the findings of the CSE study point to lax and impractical regulations and poor implementation. This newspaper recently reported a civil society groups assertion how an agriculture ministry panels approval for the import of papaya, maize and apple seeds or plants can lead to the illegal entry of GMOs and end up as GM food on our plates.Im in favour of GM food, says Moulinath Acharya, assistant professor at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, because of characteristics like increased shelf life, pest resistance, ability to thrive in adverse environment and enhanced food value. We know that GM technology is used to introduce or enhance desirable traits in target plants. In my novel, an Indian geneticist, who is in the process of developing a highly nutritive SuperRice, brags in his diary, If what we are doing here succeeds then we will have eliminated hunger from this world. In the real world too, Golden Rice, a GM variety, was developed to combat Vitamin A deficiency but counter arguments like loss of biodiversity and simpler dietary alternatives punch holes in this logic.Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of The Black Swan, has compared the optimism around GMOs to the optimism about financial markets before the global financial crisis. In a New York Times article co-authored with Mark Spitznagel, he points out fallacies in the arguments of the pro-GMO camp, which often states that there is no evidence of harm caused by GMOs. Through analogies, the authors show that the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Again, the pro-GMO camp points to scientific consensus about the safety of GMOs but Taleb has argued that the invocation of a consensus is not a valid scientific argument.The safety testing of GMOs uses the concept of substantial equivalence. If the GM product is not significantly different in its constituents (such as toxins, nutrients, allergens) from the naturally occurring product, then it passes this test. Critics like Taleb, however, say that nature creates its products through a process where errors remain locally confined while the damage caused by GMOs would be global.It has been also argued that certain GM technologies will help guarantee global food security. However, studies done by Karlheinz Erb, a social ecologist at the University of Vienna, among others, have indicated that this is not true; changing consumption habits  such as reducing over consumption in the West and reducing consumption of meat  can tackle the global food crisis.On the other side of such efforts is the desolate darkness of dystopias and end-of-the-world scenarios of fiction. The geneticist of my novel goes on to write in his diary, Life on earth will never be the same again. In the final scenes of the book, the citizens of a devastated Asian nation discover what those words could really mean.The writer has been a climate change campaigner at the UN. His novel on eco-disaster, The Butterfly Effect, has released recently"

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping in April, they had committed to a volume of sugar exports of about two million tonnes, said the official.Raw sugar is the second product after non-basmati rice that China will import from India, said the Ministry. It is a move to reduce the $60 billion trade deficit that China has with India. Indias exports to China in 2017-18 amounted to $33 billion while imports from China stood at $76.2 billion.The Ministry official said government delegations were also travelling to Malaysia and Indonesia next week, for talks to finalise sugar exports to those countries as well.India is the worlds largest sugar producer with a production of 32 million tonnes in 2018.

They rued that they had not been informed about the border closure on time.Avinash Yadav, a truck driver who headed to Narela in Delhi, said that he had to stay put till the border opened as taking the EPE would be futile. It will not serve my purpose. I will have to drive an extra 60-70 kilometres and after reaching Kondli, I will be stopped again from entering Delhi. I should have been informed about this move before entering Agra, so that I could have gone back and not headed towards NCR, he said.Drivers complained that there was no direct link to EPE for those travelling to Delhi via the Yamuna Expressway. We should be able to access the EPE after taking the direct link road from the Yamuna Expressway , said Dharmendra, a truck driver who is transporting rice from Mainpuri to Delhi. Some drivers claimed that their transporters had asked them to stay put but they had no food or water. Dalbir Singh, a transporter whose trucks run on the Yamuna Expressway, said that those approaching Delhi from Haryana could take the EPE, but those travelling from UP cities such as Agra, Kanpur, Lucknow via the Yamuna Expressway, had been hit by the move.Meanwhile, traffic police said that the trucks would be shifted to an empty space near Gaushala Road on Saturday. With respect to the demand for transit to EPE from the Yamuna Expressway, SP (traffic) Anil Jha said that a link road was being planned from near Jewar toll by YEIDA.In neighbouring Ghaziabad too, the traffic department has put a diversion plan in place. Vehicles meant to transport goods to Delhi have no option but to wait in Ghaziabad till 11pm on November 11. However, we are allowing transportation of vehicles carrying essential goods such as medicines or food. Vehicles meant for states other than Delhi are being diverted through the EPE. These vehicles have been allowed to access the expressway either from Duhai or Dasna, said Ghaziabad SP (traffic) Shyam Narayan Singh."

If Congress comes to power, it will give rice at Re 1 to all families, pension to farmers above 60 years and stipend to more than 10 lakh unemployed.The 'people's manifesto', released by Rahul at a press conference at Rajnandgaon in the presence of state Congress leaders, says that a total ban on sale of liquor would be imposed in the state while in tribal areas, gram sabhas or village councils would be empowered to decide on prohibition.The manifesto promises strict implementation of Land Acquisition Act 2013 to ensure that compensation equivalent to four times the market rate is given farmers in the event of land acquisition in rural areas. It promises substantial increase in MSP of paddy, maize, soybean, sugarcane and gram and other crops cultivated in tribal areas.

PTIRAIPUR/JAGDALPUR: Ban on liquor, interest-free loans, almost free rice and a 'Naxal-free' state -- political parties have tried every trick in the book to outdo each other with their poll promises as the voting begins Monday with Maoist-affected areas of Chhattisgarh for a multi-phased poll season across five states.Amid tight security arrangements in the wake of recent naxal attacks including one in which a Doordarshan cameraman died with two policemen, voting will take place in 18 assembly constituencies of Chhattisgarh, including 12 'red zone' seats, in the first phase on Monday.The remaining 72 seats of Chhattisgarh assembly will go to vote on November 20 as part of a multi-phased voting across five states that also include neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Mizoram.While the last phase of voting is scheduled for December 7, counting of votes for all five states will take place on December 11 for what is being dubbed by political pundits as 'semi-finals' before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make his bid for the second term in office.Chhattisgarh itself has over 1.85 crore registered voters, while it is over 5 crore in Madhya Pradesh and about 4.75 crore in Rajasthan.Mizoram has more than 7.6 lakh voters while the same for Telangana is about 2.6 crore.The number of assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh is 230, in Rajasthan 200, Telangana 119 and in Mizoram 40.In Chhattisgarh, MP and Rajasthan, the ruling BJP is pitted directly against the Congress.READ HERE | Digvijaya Singh opens third dimension to Madhya Pradesh leadership issueHowever, the Congress's efforts to forge a broad-based anti-BJP alliance has failed to fructify fully, putting a spanner for the time being in the Opposition's plans for a 'grand alliance' to take on Modi in 2019.While Chhattisgarh has traditionally seen a direct fight between the BJP and the Congress, a third force has emerged this time in the form of an alliance between former Congress chief minister Ajit Jogi's own party Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and Dalit leader Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party.The BSP got just one seat in the 2013 assembly election, with the BJP and the Congress cornering 49 and 39, respectively.An independent candidate got one.Jogi, who served as first chief minister of Chhattisgarh for three years after the state was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000, is still seen as a key force in the state's political landscape.The BSP has just one MLA in the outgoing assembly, while its vote share fell to 4.27 per cent in 2013.However, combining of forces between Jogi and Mayawati is being seen as having a multiplier effect, especially in terms of caste equations.Out of total 90 seats, 29 are reserved for tribals and 10 for Scheduled Castes.In the non-reserved seats, the population of SCs is more than 10 per cent in 40 assemblies.Besides, the other backward classes constitute about 48 per cent of the state's population.While Mayawati is known to attract Dalit voters, Jogi himself is said to have a stronghold among voters from his caste base of Mahars and Satnamis.Their alliance has projected Jogi as the state's chief ministerial candidate and Mayawati for the prime ministerial post in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.In what could be seen as indication of the kind of politicking to expect going ahead, the election campaign reached a feverish level in the first phase itself with the arch-rivals BJP and Congress indulging in searing attacks against each other.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the Congress of backing 'urban Maoists', Congress chief Rahul Gandhi alleged that the prime minister and Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh did not do any work without ""permission"" from their ""industrial friends"".Eyeing his fourth term as chief minister after already having ruled Chhattisgarh for a record 15 years in of its 18-year history, Singh hit back by calling Gandhi a mere ""entertainment"" for people in the state who could be detrimental to his own party.Voting in the chief minister's constituency will also take place in the first phase.When not levelling allegations and counter-allegations, the political leaders made a plethora of promises, including big sops, if voted to power.In its manifesto, the BJP has promised to make Chhattisgarh a ""Naxal-free"" state and give pension to small and marginal farmers.It also promised to set up multi-speciality hospitals and take the state towards prosperity.While the BJP leaders hit out at the opposition Congress for offering sops to farmers in its manifesto, the chief minister himself said his party will give Rs 1,000 per month as pension to small and marginal farmers and landless agricultural labourers aged above 60 years, among other freebies.The BJP manifesto also proposes to increase the minimum support price for several commodities.It has also promised to make the state free of Naxalism.Besides, it has promised interest-free loans for women entrepreneurs and self-help groups, promotion of tourism, a film city, milk revolution and cow sanctuaries in all divisions.On the other hand, the Congress manifesto has promised farm loan waiver within 10 days, a higher minimum support price for crops and a ban on liquor.Besides, it has proposed pension for farmers, halving of domestic electricity bills, rice at the rate of Re 1 only and a monthly stipend to 10 lakh unemployed youths.Jogi's party leaders have also promised higher subsidy for rice and other foodgrains, as also a ban on liqour."

After visiting Tapa grain market in Barnala, Sukhbir said, I have met a number of farmers who have been sitting for many days waiting to sell the crop. I have also come to know that the rice millers are demanding up to 7-8kg more paddy per quintal to store in their mills, which was illegal, but the state government is doing nothing to stop all this.He said SAD would not allow the loot of farmers and stage a protest if paddy purchase was not improved at the earliest. Former rural development minister Sikander Singh Maluka and former finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa accompanied Sukhbir in the mandis. He said that with an aim to saving free electricity being given to the agriculture sector, the state government made farmers delay transplanting of paddy by five days due to which the crop got less time to mature and the moisture content went up in the crop.Meanwhile, farmer organisation BKU (Sidhupur) started an indefinite hunger strike outside the Bathinda district administrative complex against no procurement of paddy with moisture content higher than 17%. Members of BKU (Sidhupur) are demanding a raise in the limit of moisture content to 24%."
