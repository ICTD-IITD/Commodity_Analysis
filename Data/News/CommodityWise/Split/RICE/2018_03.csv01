Among these, the humble millet seems to be going through a reinvention of sorts as health conscious consumers plagued by lifestyle diseases hunt for healthier alternatives to rice and wheat.Naturally Yours, a two-year old organic retail startup specialising in superfood categories such as millets, quinoa, and others, has seen almost two to three times increase in the sales of the native food grain across channels. Further, the growth has gone up to eight to ten times in case of their easy-to-make and ready-to-eat products made from the crop, including millet noodles and millet dosa mix. Vinod Kumar , CEO, Naturally Yours, said that while native foods such as millets are more affordable than global alternates like quinoa, there is still less awareness among consumers on how to cook and consume them.Similarly, Soulfull, a startup that has an objective of bringing traditional foods to the modern consumers table, and specialises in breakfast cereals such as ragi flakes, flavoured ragi bites, millet muesli , has seen its business grow 2.5x from 2015 to 2018, and with the current demand trends, expects growth to be around 5x by 2019.iD Fresh Food, a startup in the instant food category, is new to the superfoods space, but is already reaping benefits. The company launched their first product in the variant, the Ragi idly dosa batter a year ago, and since then its sales is growing 6-10% month on month.Organic food retailer 24 Mantra too has seen around 15-20% increase year-on-year in the sales of its millet products, but Raj Seelam, founder and CEO, 24 Mantra, said the grain still makes up a low share of their total revenue, as rice and wheat continue to dominate. We are seeing more traction for millets such as Ragi from the South of India, he added. Millets have also started to find its place in the menus of restaurants, both small and big. For instance, Chennai-based Millet Magic Meal, a kitchen that exclusively serves millet-based dishes launched in 2015 (a time when awareness was quite low), and has since then served over 40,000 customers, growing almost three times from 2017 to 2018. The startup, run by co-founder couple Adhieswari S and Suresh Kumar has over 10,000 ratings on Swiggy with an average 4.7 rating, and is in early talks with investors for fundraising."

He told me there were leopard cubs in his agricultural land in Nanoli Tarf Chakan near Talegaon Dabhade. I, along with Anil Andre and Nayan Kadam, went to the spot and called the forest department officials. These cubs were of fishing cat and not of a leopard. Later, the cubs were taken away by their mother at night. Somnath Takawale, range forest officer (RFO), Vadgaon Maval, confirmed that three cubs of fishing cat were found at Nanoli village and their mother took them with her in the evening.Dabhade said, I own around 12 acres of agriculture land on the foothills of Firangaidevi hill. Labourers have been cutting sugarcane for a fortnight. On Sunday, they found cubs in the field. They feared the cubs were of a leopard. So, I called Garade to check which species the cubs belonged to. We relived a sigh of relief on knowing that the cubs were of a fishing cat. Garade said, Indrayani river flows near the village. Also, there is Jadhavwadi dam nearby to provide fish to the cat. People grow sugarcane, rice and other crops using water from the wells and Indrayani river. These fields provide hiding place to the wildcats."

It will reduce terminal congestion at Thiruvananthapuram railway station. Chennai Egmore-Kanniyakumari Express is the primary train for travellers from southern districts to Chennai. The trains coaches are lying idle at Nagercoil station. Southern Railway is planning to operate a new service using this rake. We strongly oppose the move because any hindrance caused to the service will affect the operation of Kanniyakumari-Chennai Express.P. Edward Jeni,Nagercoil.Expedite projectsSome of the problems faced by Nagercoil will be solved if unfinished projects like Puthan anai drinking water scheme, underground drainage, removal of encroachments, creation of parking space and widening of roads are expedited. Inadequate parking space, results in pavement parking, accidents and chaotic traffic. As the Anna bus stand at Meenakshipuram was once a lake, it is much below the road level. Hence construction of a multi-storey parking facility above the road level over the bus stand will solve the parking problem to a very great extent,G. Stanley Jeyasingh,Nagercoil.Nilavembu kudineerRecently, Virudhunagar Collector imposed a fine on a school and a private office for allowing breeding of dengue-causing mosquitoes on their premises (October 25). The intention of the Collector was to create awareness among the public of not letting Aedes Egypti mosquitoes breed in their locality to prevent break out of dengue. Mosquito eradication must be done in Tirunelveli district also. Two years ago Nilavembu kudineer was supplied freely in Siddha Medical College, Palayamkottai, in the morning to the public. In the interest of the public, the Corporation Health department may arrange to supply Nilavembu kudineer at the same venue till the end of December.P. Victor Selvaraj,Palayamkottai.Dengue spreadIn order to contain the spread of dengue, anti-larval chemical should be supplied to the public through fair price shops to eradicate mosquitoes. Public will use the chemical to prevent breeding of mosquitoes around their dwellings as and when necessary. If done so, Tamil Nadu will be able to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. The Public Health department should swing into action in this regard.K. Chelliah,Aundivillai.IICases of dengue and swine flu are reported from all over the State. The efforts initiated by local bodies to prevent the spread are to be appreciated as health workers are visiting houses to offer tips on preventive measures. Hefty fines are imposed for repeated violations. But regulators themselves have to act in some cases.Especially in the extended area of Thoothukudi Corporation, where the fourth pipeline scheme is implemented, potable water leak is observed in many places. These leaks facilitate breeding of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Hence I appeal to the authorities concerned to arrest the leaks at the earliest.J. Edison Devakaram,Thoothukudi.Open parksSeveral parks and playgrounds meant for children in Tirunelveli have not been thrown open for public use. Children are not able to use the play materials provided in the parks and the use of pathways for taking a walk is denied for aged people. Tirunelveli Corporation Commissioner is requested to take action to open the parks as early as possible.Shanmugasubramanian,Tirunelveli.Who is to care for them?Recently, during a visit to Tirunelveli, I could see many people, especially mentally affected and physically challenged people, seeking alms all along the way from Junction to Palayamkottai. Why do these people have to suffer in a civilised society? At a time when the poor are provided with free rice every month, is there nobody to take care of them? I request the Social Welfare department and NGOs to take joint action.S. Meenakshi Sundaram,Pavoorchatram."

Many recognised the dark-haired, tall stunner from her television appearances as an anchor for ProKabaddi League.Ten years ago, the Australian swimmer had surprised the world when she won three gold medals with World-record timing at the Beijing Olympics. But, shortly after, she struggled at the London Olympics in 2012 with shoulder injuries. She retired at the age of 24.Now she is enjoying life after sports. Besides doing television, she conducts swimming clinics; she has done quite a few of them in India and is keen to help the country make a splash at the global arena.There is no reason why India cannot do well in swimming, Rice, who was one of the speakers at the Ekamra Sports Literary Festival, organised by the Odisha government and Emerging Sports, told The Hindu.Rice feels there is a lot of potential in India. I have come across some promising swimmers through the clinics I have conducted here, she said. They have good technique, but needed to be trained by coaches who have trained high-profile swimmers.I feel India could take a leaf out of South Koreas book. They used to send 10 or 12 swimmers to train with us in Australia and then our coaches would go to Korea, she said. That is the way forward for India.She said the Indian administrators have to be serious first. I have visited India seven times and I have been asked by the authorities here eight times to help them, but nothing has happened so far, she said. India should think of a four-year programme. The Tokyo Games should not be the goal; it is just a year and a half away.On her career, she said she didnt imagine she would do so well at the 2008 Olympics. The three golds were special and nothing less than a dream-come-true, she said.She said the decision to quit, in 2012, was not easy. It was tough emotionally, she said. But I didnt see myself swimming for another four years (till Rio). It took me three or four years to discover what I enjoyed doing."

On Diwali, Gujjars don't sell milk, but distribute it free.The tradition dates back to Ramayan era. It is said that when Lord Ram returned to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile, he first performed shraadh for his father king Dasrath who died when he was away in jungle.Community leader Nand Kishore Gujjar said, his community finds mention in Ramayana era and ancestors were followers of Lord Ram. The tradition still continues and generations after generations perform shraadh on Diwali.Kushal Chandela said that Gujjars don't sell milk and if they want to give, they give it free. Mostly rice pudding is prepared on this day and distributed among the community members. There is no ritual of feeding Brahmins, he said.The members of the Gujjar community gather near a water source and offer "" tarpan "" (food) to the departed souls. The food is left in the water along with a climber. This is the symbol that their generations are tied up in that way.Preforming shraadh doesn't mean Gujjars don't celebrate Diwali. After shraad, they greet everyone on Diwali and visit their houses to light up lamps."

The canteens have become a huge hit in Bengaluru and other parts of the state. The three canteens opened at S M Krishna Nagar, Sonia Gandhi Nagar and New English School in Hubballi in September, have been receiving an overwhelming response.However, the Indira canteens set up at Unkal, New Bus Terminus, Bengeri in Keswapur and KIMS, are yet to be inaugurated. Besides, the canteens at Mini Vidhan Soudha and New Bus Stand in Dharwad are also to be opened.Prakash Pawar, an operation manager of an agency which supplies food to all canteens in twin cities told TOI, People are enjoying quality food at an affordable cost at the three opened canteens. We are ready to supply food to all the canteens if they are opened at a time. But we do not know why there has been a delay in opning the six other Indira canteens.We serve breakfast from 7.30 am to 10 am, lunch from 12.30 pm to 3 pm and dinner from 6 pm to 8 pm. Breakfast costs Rs 5 while lunch and dinner Rs 10. For breakfast, idli and sambhar/chutney is served. Puliyogare, kharabath, pongal, rava kichadi, chitranna, vangibath and kharabath and kesaribath will be served from Monday to Sunday, respective. For lunch and dinner, rice with vegetable sambar and curd rice is available, he added. HDMC commissioner Shakeel Ahamed said there wasnt any technical problem in opening the other canteens. We are opening the Indira Canteens in a phased manner and we dont want to create unnecessary chaos by opening all the seven canteens at a time. We opened three canteens in the first phase and also got a positive feedback from the public. We are now ready to open four more canteens in Hubballi and two in Dharwad in the next week after Deepavali, he added.Condemning the delay in opening of Indira Canteen in Hubballi-Dharwad Central constituency, Congress workers blocked a road and burnt an effigy of former chief minister Jagadish Shettar here on Monday.Led by Hubballi-Dharwad City Congress unit president Altaf Hallur, Youth Congress, NSUI and Mahila Congress workers staged a protest in Gokul Road and at Keshwapur. Hallur said MLA Shettar was playing dirty politics to start the canteens. Indira Canteen is one of the important schemes of the Siddaramaiah government and Shettar should have shown interest to inaugurate it for the benefit of common people, he said. If authorities fail to inaugurate the canteen at Keshwapur by November 15, then the Congress party will inaugurate it by inviting district minister R V Deshpande, he added.HDMC zonal assistant commissioner V M Hiremath said no elected representative had opposed the inauguration of the canteens. We have discussed the matter with the HDMC commissioner and the canteens will be inaugurated by November 15, he said."

(Thinkstock)The Mamata Banerjee government on Monday suspended an official for delay in distribution of cheap food grains among farmers unwilling to part with land in Singur for a Tata car project.The food and supplies department suspended the Hooghly district controller of food and supplies after it was found that 1,600 unwilling farmers did not receive monthly allotment of 8kg of rice at Rs 2 a kg for October. The preliminary finding is that it was a fault on part of the officer, said a senior government official.Sources said 1,600 families, who had already received their land back two years ago following a Supreme Court order in 2016, were getting cheap rice and Rs 2,000 every month since Trinamul came to power in 2011.An official said the beneficiaries were issued special coupons to claim their allotment from local fair price shops twice a year.The farmers were supposed to get fresh coupons in September to get their allotment from October, but they didnt.It was found that though required quantum of rice was sent to Singur, the district controller could not supply the coupons. He explained to the government that he had floated a tender to print fresh coupons. The government is not buying his argument as this should have been done on an urgent basis, said the official.Along with cheap rice, the families did not get Rs 2,000 either in October. The industries department, which gives the financial support, told the government that it was a fault on the part of banks as the funds were transferred to the banks.Initially the state government did not take any action against the industries department, but the matter will be investigated, said a source.Questions have been raised on why and how long the farmers will live on doles from the government as they had got back their plots two years ago.The chief minister had announced that the farmers would get back their plots in cultivable condition.The government spent nearly Rs 100 crore to make the plots cultivable by uprooting the structures put up by the Tatas and filling up low lying areas. But it now appears all these were not enough, said a bureaucrat.Sources in the agriculture department admitted that the majority of the plots were not cultivable right at the moment as the top soil, the most fertile portion of land, was destroyed due to the concrete structures put on the plots.It will take few years to get the plots settle down. Till then, it is not possible to undertake cultivation.

(Photo | AP)At the vocational college in the capital where former president Andry Rajoelina is expected to cast his ballot, several dozen electors queued patiently, an AFP team saw.""I've come here to do my duty by voting before going to get something to eat for me and my family.I want a president who gets me out of poverty,"" said Eline Faraniaina, an unemployed 60-year-old.One presidential contender must win 50 per cent of votes cast or a second round will be held on December 19.Rajaonarimampianina is competing against two of his predecessors.Marc Ravalomanana, a milk mogul, ruled from 2002 to 2009 and Rajoelina, a former club night promoter nicknamed ""the disc jockey"", succeeded him and was in power until 2013.The trio staged massive rallies over the weekend in the capital, each attracting tens of thousands of supporters.The former French colony has struggled to overcome political divisions after a disputed 2001 election that sparked clashes and a 2009 military-backed coup that ousted Ravalomanana.Apart from protests earlier this year, Rajaonarimampianina's term was mostly peaceful but anger over the past still simmers.He has promised ""a new phase"" in Madagascar's development if elected.""I'm poor. I live hand to mouth, day to day. I don't have anything to eat for tomorrow,"" said Coledette, a mother-of-four angered by recent increases in the price of rice ahead of the poll.The key battle will be between Rajaonarimampianina and the former presidents Ravalomanana and Rajoelina, according to analysts and the findings of a banned pre-vote poll seen by AFP.The survey, commissioned by the German Friedrich Ebert Foundation, gave Rajoelina support of 25 per cent, Ravalomanana 17 per cent and four per cent for Rajaonarimampianina.""The big risk of this election is that it will return us to an era of crisis,"" said Sahondra Rabenarivo, an analyst at the Malagasy Observatory on Public Life.""It's very important that the results are credible and that the third-placed candidate accepts them,"" added Rabenarivo referring to the leading hopeful who will not advance to any second round which could see the leading two hopefuls do battle.Tensions are high between Ravalomanana and Rajoelina who succeeded him with the backing of the army in the 2009 uprising.Madagascar is one of the world's poorest countries, according to World Bank data, with almost four in five people living in grinding poverty.The trio of main contenders -- armed with significant campaign resources -- have criss-crossed the island of 25 million by helicopter promising voters a better future.""They should revive the country. Madagascar suffers malnutrition and is ravaged by cyclones,"" said retiree Lili Rahaingo, 68, as she queued to vote in the capital.Although there were bloody protests in April that left two people dead, campaigning passed off peacefully.The candidates have however been accused of vote-buying.The head of Transparency International in Madagascar, Ketakandriana Rafitoson, was ""disgusted"" by what she says was the use of T-shirts, sewing machines and even floor tiles to secure votes.The election will be seen as an important opportunity for rivals Ravalomanana and Rajoelina to settle past scores at the ballot box, according to commentators.Both were banned from contesting the last elections in 2013.Ravalomanana, who lived in exile in South Africa until 2014 after his removal from office, is still bitter after his removal by Rajoelina in the coup that left the island internationally isolated and bitterly divided.Rajoelina is banking on his youth and communication skills to rally support.Around 20 lower-profile candidates have alleged irregularities in the electoral roll and had unsuccessfully called for the poll to be delayed."

And a few people are using this opportunity to spread some cheer and light. Instead of opting for the usual boxes of sweets and dry fruits, they are choosing gifts that are meaningful  ones that either spread an important message or support a cause.Dr Padmini Sharma, for instance, is buying her diyas from Madhuram Narayanan Centre (MNC) for Exceptional Children, which provides hands-on training for children with various developmental disabilities.This year, for Diwali, the children have hand-painted clay diyas, and made marble envelopes and gift bags with the help of their parents. It is really fascinating to see what they have done. The diyas are beautiful and I gift them to friends and relatives every Diwali, says Dr Sharma, who is also a volunteer at MNC.Nammanellu, a city-based organisation that aims to conserve indigenous seeds has come up with a Diwali hamper, comprising an array of indigenous rice varieties packaged in colourful gift boxes. The idea is to promote consumer awareness so that more people opt for traditional rice varieties that also have more nutritional benefit.If you believe in living green, you can opt for upcycled products made by Mridula Harihar, who creates wonders from waste. An artist whose forte is fused glass art, she collects old bottles and pieces of broken windows and transforms them into works of beauty. I dont want upcycled products to look like they are made from waste. I want to use waste and create products that look new and unique, she says.Her creations range from coral diyas, multipurpose dishes, and pendants, to cat and dog-inspired suncatchers. In August, Mridula made diyas from waste that resemble corals. These were dedicated to the beaches of Chennai.And her products are a hit with people. I buy the upcycled pendants, as they are a definite style statement, says Karthik Magesh, a customer."

Much in demand were blankets to ward of the chill, a big change after trudging for three weeks in tropical heat.ALSO READ | Caravan migrants split up in Mexico, continue their journeyMany people went to medical tents to get treatment for blistered and aching feet, illness and other maladies. ""Since we got here, we have not stopped,"" said Tania Escobar, a nurse with Mexico City's public health department.Melvin Figueroa, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was traveling with his pregnant wife and two children, 6 and 8. He brought the 6-year-old girl to the tent because her eyes were irritated and ""she throws up everything she eats.""Several thousand more migrants were trudging along the highway between the city of Puebla and the capital, catching a lift from passing vehicles when possible.Nashieli Ramirez, ombudsman for the city's human rights commission, said the city was preparing to accommodate as many as 5,000 migrants from the lead caravan and several smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it, for as long as necessary.A Central American migrant covers himself from the cold at a shelter in the Jesus Martinez stadium, in Mexico City, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018. (Photo | AP)""We have the space in terms of humanitarian help,"" Ramirez said.As U.S. election day neared, Trump has seized on the caravan and portrayed it as a major threat, even though such caravans have happened regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed.He ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border when the migrants were still hundreds of miles to the south, threatened to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.In dozens of interviews since the caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are fleeing rampant poverty and violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence; others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support loved ones back home.Alba Zoleida Gonzalez, 48, from Valle, Honduras, said she had walked for five hours and hitched a ride on a tractor-trailer with about 150 people. Her calf muscles were aching, but that was a small price to pay for the chance at a life better than the one back home.""I looked for work, and nothing,"" Gonzalez said, adding that her husband had been robbed and had to hand over everything he made selling crabs so his assailants wouldn't do worse. ""And when one does find a little job they kill you for the money,"" she said.U.S.-bound Central American migrants begin their morning trek with a free ride on a truck, as part of a thousands-strong caravan leaving Cordoba, Veracruz state, Mexico, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018. (Photo | AP)Arriving in Mexico City, some migrants stopped at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a major pilgrimage site, to thank the Virgin Mary for watching over them during the journey.Many had struck out ahead of the larger caravan but intended to regroup in the capital. Oscar Ulloa, 20, an accountant from Honduras, said he arrived by bus from Puebla thanks to handouts from Mexicans. He expected the group would assemble and vote in the coming days on their next moves.The 178-mile trek (286 kilometers) Monday from the Gulf state of Veracruz to Mexico City was the longest single-day journey for the group of about 4,000 migrants.But there were obstacles on this latest stretch.ALSO READ | Caravan migrants' brief hopes of buses to Mexico's capital dashedTruck after truck denied the migrants rides as they trudged along the highway into the relatively colder November temperatures of central highland Mexico.At a toll booth near Fortin, Veracruz, Rafael Leyva, an unemployed cobbler from Honduras, stood with a few hundred others for more than 45 minutes without finding a ride.""People help more in Chiapas and Oaxaca,"" Leyva said, referring to the southern Mexican states the group had already traversed and where pickup trucks frequently stopped to offer rides.Migrants converged on tractor trailers, forcing the big rigs to stop so they could climb aboard. Such impromptu hitchhiking is precarious with dozens scrambling onto vehicles at a time.Cesar Rodas, 24, had pushed a friend's wheelchair for 24 days across three countries. But he couldn't lift his friend and the chair onto a truck bed crammed with 150 people. Rodas was trying to get Sergio Cazares, a 40-year-old paraplegic from Honduras, to the U.S. for an operation that Cazares hopes will allow him to walk again.Central American migrants, part of a caravan hoping to reach the U.S. gets settled in a shelter at the Jesus Martinez stadium, in Mexico City. (Photo | AP)Mexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.Many said they remain convinced that traveling together is their best hope for reaching the U.S.Yuri Juarez, 42, said he thinks there's a ""very low"" chance he will get asylum in the United States. But he said he had no way to work back home in Villanueva, Guatemala, where he closed his internet cafe after gang members extorted him, robbed his customers and finally stole his computers.Mexico faces the unprecedented situation of having at least three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz. The largest group has been followed by about 1,000 who crossed over from Guatemala last week and a second group of about the same size that waded over the Suchiate River on Friday.ALSO READ | Donald Trump suggests firing at migrant caravan if people throw stonesMexico's Interior Ministry estimated over the weekend that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through Mexico. The ministry said 2,793 migrants have applied for refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their home countries.The presidents of Guatemala and Honduras, which have been under intense pressure from the Trump administration, called Monday for an investigation to identify the organizers of the caravan.Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that ""thousands"" of his countrymen have returned to Honduras. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales went further, calling for an investigation of people who ""promote or participate"" in the caravan, saying they ""should be judged based on international laws.""Most of the migrants interviewed say they joined the caravan spontaneously to stay safe, and many were already on the road when it caught up to them. Activist groups that have been trying to help organize things appear to have emerged only after it formed and began moving north."

On Sunday, meat stall owners were busy prepping up for Diwali special sales by procuring large number of goats and chickens. The festival special sale is set to kick-start from Monday evening and go on till Tuesday morning. Mutton curry served along with idli for breakfast or with rice for lunch is a ritual among many households in the city. As a result, sales are expected to be at least twice compared to a usual busy Sunday.This demand has led to meat stall owners increase the retail price of of mutton (with bone) from around Rs 600 to Rs 650 per kg.According to Jayaraman, the owner of J Prabhakaran mutton stall at Irudayapuram, Diwali is one of the most profitable season for meat sellers. As the demand increases by at least by 100% compared to normal Sundays, we procure huge amounts of goats. Normally, I only get four goats per week, but Ive already purchased 10 goats for the festival sales and will procure more before the sale which starts on Monday night, Prabhakaran said.Most of the meat shop owners in the city procured goats from Samayapuram and Manapparai, while a few purchased from a few villages in Karur.The Saturday market at Samayapuram and Wednesday market at Manapparai saw meat sellers from across the central region throng there to procure goats. The price of one goat in the market started at around Rs 500 and went up till Rs 8,000.S Sadiq Basha, who owns a mutton shop at Puthur, said, Kongu goat breed is in high demand this festive season. The taste is really good and thats why many people are opting for this. We have procured 25 Kongu goats from a few villages in Karur district, Basha said.As the sale of chicken is not expected to increase as much during Diwali, meat stall owners have not increased its price. Broiler chicken is usually sold at Rs 144/kg and has not been increased this season too. Same is the case with country chicken, which costs Rs 380/kg,said R Kannan, owner of RKS Broilers at Sangiliyandapuram. However, he expressed concern on sales being limited to a certain extent as Diwali falls on a Tuesday, the day when several Hindus usually avoid eating meat. The sale of fish does not increase during the festive season."

But Ben Johnson's victory in 100 metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics was short-lived. A positive dope test saw him turn from world beater to a disgraced sprinter. It's been 30 years since, but the dark days of the far east still travel with him. But it's his eyes which betray that despondency, the fire in them still burning, one which had singed opponents and burnt record books in his prime.These days Ben Johnson speaks about doping and its perils, as he was doing on the concluding day of the inaugural Ekamra Sports Literary Festival here. ""I was a victim of dirty politics,"" Johnson said. ""What happened with me in Seoul was premeditated. I knew that from day one. And 30 years later, the truth has come out. But what happened was my destiny and I cannot change it. But I wish no one else faces a similar situation.""Recently, a Canadian newspaper had reported severe inconsistencies in Johnson's dope test report at the 1988 Olympics. Recalling the dark days, Johnson said, ""I feel like yesterday and I still get the shivers when I remember those dark days. It took lots of power, strength and courage to overcome."" The athlete-turned-coach said after if he puts in six to eight months into training, he can still run 100m in 10.6 or 10.7 seconds. Johnson, incidentally, had clocked 9.79 sec in Seoul.When asked about the existing practice of doping in sports, Johnson said, ""I am out of the game for so many years and I cannot really comment on what is happening. But I think people are still doing what they want to. It is very much in the game.""The star-studded festival also witnessed the presence of gymnast Dipa Karmakar and her coach Bishweshwar Nandi, besides the likes of cricketer Ajinkya Rahane, former international Mohammad Kaif, London Olympic Games bronze medal winning wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt and 2018 Asian Games gold medallist wrestler Vinesh Phogat as well as former India hockey player Sardar Singh. Speaking on the occasion Karmakar said, ""A lot has been written about my narrow miss at the Rio Olympics but not many seem to know that Tripura has been a cradle of Indian gymnastics from the 1960s. I do hope that my story inspires many more children to take up gymnastics and never take no for an answer.""Australian swimmer Stephanie Rice shared some personal moments from her childhood.during one of the sessions.Besides highlighting the road to success, she also spoke about the pitfalls and also what a nation like India needs to do to create a environment where children can pursue swimming as a sport.EoM"

Amma Mess, run by V M Ramalingam, serves at least 100 customers daily, with some even travelling kilometres to just have a taste of the crab delicacy.According to Ramalingam, a talented cook, the eatery became a favourite among people as all their dishes reminded many people of home-cooked food. The name Amma Mess fits very well with our style of cooking because people tell us that the food they taste at my eatery reminds them of their mothers cooking, the 55-year-old added. The eatery is open everyday from 12pm to 4pm and 7pm to 11.30pm.While nandu milagu kuzhambu is the most sought-after item at the eatery, kaadai (quail) milagu kuzhambu and country-chicken curry are the next most popular dishes.

Items like parotta and idli are mostly associated with chicken or mutton gravy. But here, many have the crab gravy with these items as it tastes unique, he said. Nandu milagu kuzhambu and kaadai milagu kuzhambu each cost Rs80, while an idli and a parotta cost Rs6 and Rs8 respectively.Ramalingam also said that people from the outskirts of the city many a time travelled all the way to his eatery just to taste the crab curry. Some people travel 20km to taste the gravy at our eatery, while a few others come and get it parcelled.

Over the course of these years, we have not changed the appearance of the eatery much. But now we are looking to extend it so that we can serve more people, he added."

Here to anchor a sports show, Rice's Instagram account is overflowing with posts showcasing her strong love for India. She even dressed up in a sari for one photo.The one thing that has genuinely caught the attention of the five-time world-record holder is India's #MeToo movement, which is growing in power with each passing day. In India for nearly a month now, Rice has been reading about the disturbing tales of sexual harassment being shared by Indian women on various social media platforms. The movement has seen several women working in the media, corporate sector and the Indian film industry speaking out and recounting their anger against the exploitation they faced.Rice, who is also involved in several public awareness campaigns back home in Australia and the US, where she coaches, feels that that it's India's moment to stand up to its women and make them feel strong.""The #MeToo movement globally has definitely allowed women to have a voice and to be heard. In India, it's equally important as well, especially for a female, to speak up against the sexual crimes. I think outside of all the ins and outs of the gender equality and sexual harassment remains the fact we are able to set the foundation of doing certain things properly. The whole movement has shown that people can't get away with it anymore and that's a really good thing,"" Rice told TOI in an exclusive chat on the sidelines of the 'Ekamra Sports Literary Festival' - Asia's first such theme-based lit fest - organized by the Odisha government on Friday.The Australian spoke about the cultural differences between India and the west. ""What I know from my time in India is that culturally things are very different to that in the US. For a woman to come out and be vocal about the harassment here, it's different to America. So, that opening up has strengthened the movement and I think it might take some time to have proper ramifications,"" she added.For Rice, the life after retirement from swimming in 2014, has allowed her to excel in her other areas of choice. Apart from her impressive swimming credentials - she is also a two-time World championships silver medallist --Rice is a reality TV show winner, a TV show presenter and a successful entrepreneur, running her own swimming coaching programme for young kids.""I always wanted to be the best in what I do. My strife for excellence has allowed me to succeed in swimming but also in TV and business. When I was a swimmer, I used to do the same thing like train for seven hours every day. Now, I like to do things differently. I am loving the new person in me,"" added Rice, who just about managed to make it to the fest after flying in from the US this morning.Talking about her love for India, Rice plans to open swimming academies where she could personally train the young kids looking to build a successful career in the sport. ""I really want to do academies, some serious work here and not like just coming for one day. I hope to develop the sport of swimming in India,"" she said."

Sydney is the perfect first stop Down Under and what a foodie paradise it is!Start your journey on Singapore Airlines, not the national carrier Qantas. You wont regret it. Apart from the seamless service, great big seats and plenty of legroom, the food and drinks are outstanding. SIA has won the prestigious award for the Best Overall Wine Cellar 2017.If youre in the rarefied atmosphere of first class, they serve Krug 2004 Champagne and one of the best Aussie wines, a Pinot Noir from Paringa Estate. In business and in all the lounges, youll be very happy with the delicious Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve. The food is designed by a panel of international chefs, so youll find Indian, Asian and Australian menus on routes Down Under and fabulous illy single-origin coffees, TWG teas, cocktails and mocktails, all served with a smile.Sydney SeaplanesReady for a bit of the high life? The luxury seaplane operator offers sightseeing tours in a classic Beaver aircraft. Whether its a scenic flight over the beautiful Sydney Harbour, a flying journey of the golden sandy Northern Beaches, a romantic picnic for two on a secluded beach, or the best taxi ride to one of Sydneys river or ocean restaurants  Sydney Seaplanes will get you there in style. They take off from Rose Bay, which you can reach by either taxi or even better, a lovely inexpensive ferry ride from Circular Quay. On a fine day, the dashing young pilots in shorts are happy to take you on a scenic tour of Sydney over the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, down along many of Sydneys beautiful northern beaches and harbours to our destination, which happened to be Whale Beach, a stretch of pristine white sand and spectacular views. It would normally take an hour or so to reach here by car from Sydney but in the seaplane it takes only 20 minutes.Tasmanian Pacific Oysters with rice wine vinaigrette at Tetsuyas, which is owned by Tetsuya Wakuda (below) Sourced by The TelegraphTetsuyas restaurantYes, believe it or not, there are some really world-class food experiences to be had in the city. One of my favourite fine dining restaurants is Tetsuyas, which combines a masterful blend of skill, artistry and taste. Tetsuya Wakudas attention to detail is consistent and beyond sublime. Signature dishes include the confit of Ocean trout, consomme of tomato and tea, Tasmanian Pacific oysters with rice wine vinaigrette, tuna with daikon and wasabi, sea scallops with lemonade fruit and yuzu, and the sashimi of hamachi (kingfish) with blood orange and vinaigrette.The petuna ocean trout dish has been served in the restaurant ever since it was a humble first-floor dwelling in a very ordinary suburb of Sydney. Tetsuya was the first chef to discover this fish and to source many wonderful products from all over Australia. Do not leave without trying the warm kombu bread and truffle butter served regularly in between courses. Not that you need any more food but this is a must-do. Tetsuyas only does a degustation menu  10 courses paired with world wines. There is no a la carte. Each dish is truly a culinary masterpiece. If you have the time, budget and inclination (youll have to reserve way in advance), dont miss it. Aus $240 pp for the whole experience.Bondi Beach Sourced by The TelegraphBondi BeachI heard plenty about Bondi Beach but had not realised that it has a sub-culture of its own. Its not just a series of serious beaches (Bondi/Tamarama/Bronte) but an area of great restaurants, cafes and shops which makes Bondi a real Sydney suburb worth talking about well beyond the hippie image it once had. Musts to visit in the area are Camilla for silk kaftans, Gertrude & Alice for books and coffee, and Icebergs for the most spectacular lunch overlooking Bondi Beach. Its not just a restaurant serving outstanding food (not surprisingly a huge variety of seafood and Italian), its a style statement. And dont forget to listen to Bondi 88 FM, the local radio station, while you are there.Jonahs offers an excellent view and seafood Sourced by The TelegraphJonahsPerhaps the only feature that can divert your attention from the stunning view at Jonahs is the exceptional food and wine offering. The award-winning hatted restaurant offers excellent contemporary Australian cuisine under the direction of chef Matteo Zamboni. They were the recipient of Australias Wine List of the Year Awards in 2017 by Gourmet Traveller with a cellar containing over 11,000 bottles of vintage Australian and international wines and a wine list of more than 1,600 different labels.Apart from the fabulous food and wine, Jonahs is a little luxury getaway with 11 beautiful rooms, all with stunning sea views, a spa and all the trimmings. The seafood platter for lunch which consists of a deck of raw and cured fish and oysters to crayfish thermidor and warm Coffin Bay scallops along with a glass of Aussie Arras sparkling, is a must-have. And yes, an added bonus is that you can spot whales as they migrate between May and November.Sydney Opera House Sourced by The TelegraphSydney Opera HouseGo for a guided tour or, even better, go see an opera at any of their six halls. Join the one-hour Essential Tour and see inside the World Heritage-listed House. Your guide will show you the theatres and stages where more than 1,600 performances come to life annually. Youll see some of the thousand rooms and 300 corridors of the building. Youll leave this tour with a fascinating account of the Houses history and architecture  its an exciting introduction to Sydneys vibrant performing arts scene.QT Sydney shares the building with two historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre Sourced by The TelegraphQT SydneyA new Australian brand of hospitality, QT Sydney had a much-anticipated opening this year and is the only Sydney hotel to be a member of the exclusive Design Hotels. Rocking the city with their edgy, quirky design, happening F&B spaces, bars and beautifully decorated contemporary rooms, QT Sydney shares the building with two of the citys most majestic historical buildings, Gowings and The State Theatre. The eccentricity of the hotel is offset by the historical features of the building, such as the blend of gothic, art deco, and Italian-influenced architecture. Although I didnt stay at the QT, the vibe intrigued me as I walked in off the busy and bustling Market Street where most of the high-end shopping, restaurants and bars are. I was hoping that quirky didnt stretch to the bedrooms and was pleasantly surprised at the comfort level of their spacious rooms. Apart from this, it seems to be the place for the wild, wacky and cool crowd to party.A salad of spring peas stracciatella, smoked almonds, rye crumble, asparagus and tomato chutney Sourced by The TelegraphBennelong RestaurantUpmarket yet relaxed, Bennelong Restaurant is an absolute treat for lunch. The bar is literally under the Opera Houses shell vaulted sails with spectacular views over the Harbour Bridge. The restaurant with huge glass panels overlooks Circular Quay and the Harbour. The menu is based on award-winning chef Peter Gilmores vision of Australian cuisine. Incidentally, he also runs the other culinary icon in Sydney, Quay restaurant which is just opposite. You can choose from a two- or three-course a la carte menu with service starting early, catering to the pre-theatre dining crowd. Dishes to go for are the salad of spring peas, smoked almonds, asparagus and tomato chutney; wild cape york barramundi and the mooloolaba yellowfin tuna with kohlrabi remoulade. Benelong offers 180 of the countrys favourite and small-scale wine labels from an eclectic collection of winemakers. This is quintessential Sydney for me.An usual evening at Bennelong Restaurant Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish market Sourced by The TelegraphSydney fish marketFirstly, unlike many fish markets I have visited round the world, it doesnt smell fishy. The variety of Australian seafood alone is quite staggering  from Tasmanian giant abalone and crabs weighing 17kg to prawns, crayfish, Moreton Bay bugs, marons, Balmain bay bugs (all Aussie crustaceans), rock lobster and, of course, oysters galore. Each fishmonger in addition to selling fish has ready-to-eat dishes, including sushi, lobster thermidor and shucked oysters. If that isnt enough, there are plenty of restaurants both within the market and outside where you can enjoy a seafood lunch in comfort.On the first floor is the Sydney seafood school, which conducts cookery classes. On certain days of the week, they also have master classes by Sydneys top chefs. Although most of the classes are over $100 for a two- or three-hour class, lunch or dinner and a glass of wine is included. For someone who really enjoys cooking, this is a must-do. Classes run throughout the week but there seems to be a better choice over the weekend. Check for substantial discounts if youre a group of six or more.Hyatt Sydney Sourced by The TelegraphRock a 180-degree viewLocation. Location. Location. Whoever said that must have been thinking about the Hyatt Sydney. Right opposite the Opera House, under the Harbour Bridge on the edge of the fashionable area known as The Rocks, the Park Hyatt is the place to stay in Sydney if you want a view to beat all views. Choose one of the suites on the circular front of the hotel and youll have a 180-degree view of the Opera House as your 25ft electric curtains draw open. It also has one of the citys nicest restaurants on the ground floor facing the boardwalk and Sydney Harbour.Karen Anand is a culinary consultant, food writer and entrepreneur.

5ce746b0e8e3fc56af41853a,Quick and easy recipes for Diwali parties,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/quick-and-easy-recipes-for-diwali-parties/cid/1673711,2018-11-03,"Since people are hungry when they arrive at a party, they tend to load up on appetisers. So, its a good idea to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger food. Source: `www.cucinamiabynatasha.com`I love how the festive season in India stretches for so long. In Bengal it starts with Durga Puja and in other parts of the country with Dussehra. Once that is done, the countdown to Diwali begins and then theres bhai phonta or bhai dooj.It goes further on to the New Year for some communities. So its a long time before people are back to normal life! And this means parties, celebrations and more eating and drinking. And lots of hosting! Heres a guide to make you shine as the host at your festive celebrations.DECIDE ON DECORYou do not need to spend a fortune to decorate your home to reflect the festive spirit. Diwali is all about light. So simple diyas and tea lights around the house can create magic. Pair those with fresh orange and yellow marigold and you have a gorgeous traditional look.The entrance to your home should give a positive first impression. Do it up with floating candles and flowers in a large bowl of water or a simple rangoli on the floor adorned with diyas.For me, the dining table is always the highlight as food is an integral part of any party. I love doing up the table based on the occasion and theme. At my own Diwali party in Bangalore, I added a south Indian touch with banana leaves, flowers from the local market and classic earthen diyas. All for less than Rs 200!PREP IN ADVANCEWe all host parties and get-togethers because we want to share these happy moments with our loved ones. However, most of the time, the host ends up running around and getting stressed during the party. This would not happen if you organise yourself and also reduce the number of unnecessary tasks.Choose a menu which you can prepare a day in advance. Dishes which have to be made or assembled just before serving are a complete no-no.For garnishes like fresh herbs, lime wedges and other fresh ingredients, prepare them just before the party and keep them ready on a tray in the service area of your kitchen. That way you dont have to go rummaging around in your overcrowded fridge for the dhania while the hot food is waiting to be served.Use disposable crockery and cutlery to reduce washing up. These days you get lovely bamboo and paperware which are eco-friendly and look nice as well.Ice, ice, baby! How many times have you been at a party getting your drink from the bar, only to be told Sorry we are out of ice! There is nothing more putting off than a warm drink, be it a whisky or a cola. Do remember to start stocking up on ice cubes a couple of days in advance so that will be one big job out of the way.Sweet potato chips www.cucinamiabynatasha.comSWEET POTATO CHIPSGet healthy and gourmet with these oven-baked sweet potato chips.Ingredients4 sweet potatoes2tbsp olive oilSalt and pepperChilli flakesMethodPeel the potatoes and cut into chips.Steam half-way.Heat the oven to 180C.Combine the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, salt and pepper.Bake on a baking dish or tray for about 30 minutes, tossing in between till crispy.Serve warm with any dip, sauce or chutney.Minted pea hummus/ beetroot hummus www.cucinamiabynatasha.comMINTED PEA HUMMUS/ BEETROOT HUMMUSWhen the classic hummus bores you, you revive it by adding vibrant colours and veggies! You can use either peas and mint, or beetroot in this recipe for some gorgeous hummus.Ingredients1 cup chickpeas (boiled)2 beetroots, cut in large cubes, or 1 cup of boiled peas and some mint leaves1tbsp tahini2 garlic clovestsp cumin powderJuice of  lemonChilli flakesSalt and fresh pepperToasted pine nuts or walnuts for garnishMethodSteam the beetroots/boil the peas or bake in the oven.In a blender, blend together the boiled chickpeas, beetroot/peas and mint, tahini, garlic, cumin, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Add lemon juice and 2tbsp of water till you get the right consistency.Garnish with toasted nuts and seeds. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil just before serving.GET THE MENU RIGHTIt is incredible how much food gets left over at parties and then the host family ends up eating the same thing for the next couple of days or distributing it to neighbours and domestic staff in the justification that they are not wasting food. Well, why not just make less of each with the idea that if one dish finishes there will always be something else to eat.In my opinion, the appetisers or finger food and the dessert should be the main focus. The main course could be very light or just a one-pot wholesome dish for those wanting something more. People are hungry when they arrive. So they tend to load up on appetisers.A good idea is to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger foods which people can have while playing cards.Try out some healthy appetisers like sweet potato chips with beetroot/pea and mint hummus or curried peanut dip which you can make in advance. These are regulars on my party menus by popular demand. You can also make them for your post-Diwali visits or bhai phonta gatherings as, by then, people are really done with all the heavy eating of the season.So go on, get cracking to make your festivities super special.Wish you all a shining and enjoyable Diwali!The dining table can be a highlight; decorate it in the traditional way with diyas, flowers and banana leavesCurried Peanut Dip www.cucinamiabynatasha.comCURRIED PEANUT DIPThis is a new addition to my recipe stash with an interesting desi touch of spices, peanuts and coriander.Ingredients1tbsp vegetable or olive oil1 small onion chopped1tbsp garlic, mincedtsp coriander powdertsp turmeric powderRed chilli flakes to taste2 large carrots, finely chopped cup toasted peanuts4tsp fresh lime juice1tbsp soy sauce1tsp brown sugar1tbsp crushed peanuts (for garnish)1tbsp chopped fresh coriander (for garnish)1tbsp crumbled feta cheese (optional)MethodIn a pan, heat some oil and cook the onion and garlic.Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder and red chilli flakes.Add the carrots with salt and pepper and saute until carrots are half-cooked.Add in the toasted peanuts, lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar.

5ce74ee3e8e3fc56af41898f,Efforts on to promote SRI in paddy cultivation,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/efforts-on-to-promote-sri-in-paddy-cultivation/article25385471.ece,2018-11-01,"The Agriculture Department is looking to promote the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in at least 70% of the area covered under samba season in the district this year.SRI helps maximise yield with less water. We are hoping to bring at least 87,500 acres under SRI, out of the total of 1.25 lakh acres expected to be covered under samba paddy, K.Balraj, Joint Director of Agriculture, told reporters here on Tuesday.In an attempt to persuade farmers to take to the system, the department has asked each of its 84 Assistant Agriculture Officers to adopt one revenue village to promote SRI in the entire village.On Tuesday, Collector K.Rajamani inspected some fields at Kuvalakudi, Vengur and a few other villages in Tiruverumbur taluk where SRI had been adopted. Samba paddy has been raised on about 10,115 acres in the taluk so far. Of this, the crop has been raised under SRI on about 8,775 acres. The total expected coverage of samba paddy in the taluk is 18,350 acres.Explaining the salient features of the system, Mr. Balraj said as against normal practice of transplanting paddy nurseries in about 30 days, transplantation under SRI can be done in 14 days. SRI helps reduce water requirement by 30 to 40 %. Nurseries need to be raised only on about 40 square metres to cover an acre while under conventional methods nursery is raised on about 320 square metres for an acre. Only three kg of seeds is required for an acre while farmers normally use about 20 kg of seeds for raising nurseries under the conventional method.Wider spacing between seedlings keeps pest attacks and rat menace under check and the use of cono-weeder effectively controls weed growth.R.Srinivasan, a progressive farmer of Ariyamangalam, who has been raising paddy under SRI for the past 10 years, says that he has been able to get 700 kg more yield an acre by adopting the system. I used to get about two tonnes an acre under the conventional system. Under SRI, I get at least 700 kg more an acre. Under SRI, quality tillers are ensured through line planting and good aeration, he said.Collector Mr.Rajamani said by adopting SRI farmers can save at least Rs. 5,000 an acre in the cost of cultivation. Following complaints, officials have issued stop sale orders against 24 tonnes of complex fertilizers as the maximum retail price was not printed on bags. He instructed officials to keep a close vigil against old stocks of fertilizers being sold at revised rates in the district."

Pushparaj, Chairman of AP Food Commission, at a press conference here on Wednesday.He said the Commission had reviewed key issues of ICDS projects, mid-day meal scheme, targeted public distribution system and maternity entitlement under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana scheme. Mr. Pushparaj said the government was keen on improving quality of food and nutrition levels for beneficiaries of PDS through fair price shops but the result was not on expected lines at the ground level.He said fortified rice was being given to Anganwadi centres and for the mid-day meal scheme in the districts of Krishna, Guntur, Kurnool and West Godavari. The Commission had also recommended supply of unpolished rice (brown rice) as diabetes was rampant in rural areas of Krishna, Prakasam and West Godavari districts. Similarly, red gram, sugar and millets like ragi and jowar besides double fortified salt were being supplied but the consumption was very low. The food commission chief said the civil supplies wing should take up an extensive campaign to make people aware of the significance of consuming food items with high nutritional value.Aid for Titli victimsHe said the Civil Supplies Department had distributed rice, dal, ragi, sugar, palmolien oil, potatoes and onions to the 2.48 lakh cyclone-affected victims.He said based on a recommendation by the Food Commission, the government had asked for constitution of district-level task force, a five-member body to prevent recycling of or supply of inferior quality rice. Many of the districts have not constituted the task force till date, he said. Following complaints of corruption in supply of eggs to Anganwadi centres and mid-day meal schemes, the State had decentralised the purchase system and had blacklisted the three suppliers, he said. Commissions member-secretary Ravi Babu said a legal cell had been set up to take action against those resorting to malpractice."
5ce7513fe8e3fc56af418ac3,Dye Another Day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/dye-another-day/cid/1335376,2018-11-02,"The colour of indigo, to a lot of Indians, will always be red. Not scarlet or rose or even ruby, but red like the blood oozing from a ruptured vessel and dripping with the sting of several lost generations. Less crop, more a byword for colonial excesses.Which is why, talk of an indigo resurgence across the subcontinent - Bengal, Uttarakhand, Assam, South India, Bangladesh - elicits a reflex cringe. The reaction that follows is really a question. Why do we need a crop that has been known to decimate son and soil?That was also the response Amrita Mukerji got from the farmers she employed when she decided to grow indigo in her smallish plot in Santiniketan. ""Don't grow these. They will harm the land,"" is how they warned her. ""When I asked them who had told them as much, they said they just knew,"" says Mukerji, founder of the NGO, Sutra.Around the turn of the century, after years of globe-trotting with her husband, Mukerji settled down to a retired life in Calcutta. She says, ""I had visited production centres in Nigeria. And over the years, attended indigo exhibitions, met scholars studying the history of the plant, bought prints... I started to fall in love with the blue of the indigo.""And then in 2003, textile researcher Charlotte Kwon met her in Calcutta and handed her a packet of indigo seeds.The indigo project was apparently a whim. That year, after harvest, Mukerji noticed that the land had yielded a rush of mustard. The farmers were surprised.They needn't have been. Indigo is a leguminous plant, fixes nitrogen to the soil, enhances soil quality and soil productivity and has been popular in India from time immemorial as a virtuous rotational crop. From 2016, Mukerji turned to indigo cultivation in all seriousness.Around the same time in Uttarakhand's Kumaon region, Rashmi Bharti was also planting indigo. In Uttarakhand, food crops are prone to pest attacks; monkeys, parrots and wild boars are also known to destroy food grains. Farmers were fed up. And that is when Bharti, co-founder of the NGO, Avani, that creates viable employment opportunities for rural men and women, thought of indigo cultivation as a sustainable alternative. And for good reason - not only is the plant hardy and low maintenance, monkeys do not like the taste of it and there is nothing to peck at for the birds either.Mukerji is aware of cultivation in Murshidabad. Bharti talks about other geographies - Bihar, Andhra, Karnataka. It might be too soon to call it a revolution, but there is a definite indigo wave sweeping India.Indigo is indigenous to India. One finds mention of it in works as diverse as the Atharva Veda and the Ain-i-Akbari. Jenny Balfour-Paul, an expert on the subject, writes in her book Indigo: Egyptian Mummies to Blue Jeans, ""The word indigo itself derives from the Greek indikon, Latinised indicum, originally meaning a substance from India, indicating the import of indigo pigment by the Graeco-Roman world. The Sanskirt word nila, meaning dark blue, spread from India eastwards into Southeast Asia and westward to the Near and Middle East, probably both through the pre-Islamic trading routes and subsequent trade diffusion of the product in the Islamic era...""In a WhatsApp call from London, Balfour-Paul tells The Telegraph that Bengal in particular produced the best quality of indigo. ""Bengal had the perfect soil to grow this tropical plant. There are 800 species of indigo, of which only 10 will yield colour. Indigofera tinctoria is what is found in Bengal.""So when and how did indigo come to be a pejorative? The East India Company was aware of the commercial worth of indigo. There were indigo plantations across colonies.In her book, Balfour writes about how the company actively promoted Bengal's indigo industry by providing heavy subsidies and underwriting initial big losses. It brought over European indigo planters from the West Indies to establish efficient factories, and Bengal indigo soon equalled in quality the finest West Indian product. ""So successful was the operation that the company's Asian indigo imports into London jumped from 25,000 pounds in 1782 (when most of the indigo came from America and West Indies) to 43,68,000 pounds in 1795, the bulk of it from Bengal.""At the time, four million people were employed in the production and manufacture of indigo in Bengal alone. Indigo was a hugely profitable enterprise. Its colour was gold.Research associate Sanjukta Ghosh of SOAS South Asia Institute, London, tells us that W.B. Hudson, a major planter in the region, claimed that 4.5 million was invested in the indigo industry. The problem started when profits were not ploughed back to the ryots or indigo farmers. She talks about the planters' ostentatious lifestyle - sprawling bungalows, obliging servants. As the returns on indigo increased, so did their greed, and a time came when they started taking away every cultivable land for indigo cultivation.Indigo might have been gold, but what is gold in the face of hunger? The aggressive push landed on the farmer's stomach, fair and square.By the mid 19th century, the exploitation had assumed monstrous proportions. In 1860, on the back of the uprising of 1857, Dina-bandhu Mitra, an employee of the Raj, wrote a play on the subject. Titled Nil Darpan, it was meant to show the mirror to the Raj, the story behind the indigo success story. In his biography of Mitra, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay wrote: ""Nil Darpan is to Bengal what Uncle Tom's Cabin is to America's slave movement.""Taking a cue from Nil Darpan, several learned men of Bengal took up the pen. One such anonymous writer's song goes thus: ""Hey nirodoy nilkargan/aar shohena praney ei nildahan/Krishaker dhoney praney/Dohile nilagune..."" The farmer writhing in agony is crying out to the indigo planters for mercy, pleading with them to rein in their indigo lust.Nil Darpan shook up British Parliament after 200 translated copies landed in Britain. It decreed that one could cultivate indigo in Bengal only if one was a landowner. Most of the planters were using leased land and when this diktat kicked in, they started looking for bluer pastures.Balfour-Paul tells us that two-fifths of the million-and-a-half acre of land that was under cultivation in India was in Bihar. She writes, ""Though the term satyagraha was coined much later in history, 'Champaran Satyagraha' began with peasants revolting against the Indigo planters.""From gold, indigo had taken the colour of death - black.Every drama must have its denouement. Indigo's was written by a German chemist. Adolf Von Baeyer invented synthetic indigo towards the end of the 19th century. It was cheaper, came minus the bloodbath and made natural indigo inconsequential.But not all the holy waters of India could wash the taint off the Blue Devil. At some point, history polluted fact and it came to be accepted, most mistakenly, that indigo was a villainous plant.Crops do not understand man-made divisions. As then, so also now, indigo is a common benison of India and Bangladesh.Ruby Ghuznavi is the founder of Aranya Crafts, an indigo enterprise based in Dhaka. She says, ""We first cultivated and extracted indigo in Bangladesh on an experimental basis in 1984. It was not very well received by the farmers because of its negative history. But once it was apparent to them that they would be the actual beneficiaries and indigo would no longer be the exploitative crop of the past, they accepted its production very eagerly. The fact that indigo as an extra crop between two major rice harvests has brought extra earnings for the farmers, is well appreciated by them.""Mishael Aziz Ahmad is also from Bangladesh, and runs the social enterprise Living Blue. He says that farmers in north Bangladesh were intercropping Indigofera tinctoria all along, as a fertiliser. Thus, in reality, indigo had never died out. What had happened was its use had changed from dye to fertiliser. Ahmad says, ""Now about 3,000 farmers in 80 to 100 villages are planting indigo in the peripheral lands. Landless labourers are also planting it by the roadside and earning a few bucks during the lull period. In Bangladesh, people have accepted it as a crop that is creating more employment opportunities.""Ahmad's account dovetails into Rashmi Bharti's. In Uttarakhand, there was a problem. Men would leave their villages for cities in search of jobs, and the women were left behind. The large tracts of unused land invited soil erosion.Indigo cultivation has addressed all these problems. Apart from the fact that it can grow at an altitude as high as 5,500 feet, indigo cultivation is not very labour intensive. Bharti's NGO has trained the women of these villages to do both. She says, ""In the first year, we had started with only 20 farmers. In 2017, we had 250 farmers. Their total earnings this year was Rs 4.6 lakh.""Avani consumes most of the produce currently as the market in India is nascent. Apart from dyeing - it is widely used in dyeing jeans - indigo is used for products such as watercolours, crayons and wood stains.Amrita Mukerji tells us that indigo is a non-pollutant and eco-friendly natural dye.In several pockets in south India, it turns out that indigo never went out of fashion. Victoria Vijayakumar, who runs Aranya Naturals, a community development project by the Tatas, tells us that indigo cultivation has been going on for generations in Munnar. It was used as manure. Vijayakumar also confirms that the renewed use of indigo for its dye is relatively recent. She tells us, ""We have six acres of land under indigo cultivation and in three years we have had 18 harvests. This year 80 kilos of indigo was extracted.""And so indigo has come full circle. From blue to gold to black to red, it is back to being a vivid blue once again. The colour of the expansive horizon, of the bottomless waters, and above all, of freedom and promise."

A closer examination revealed that the sugar they had bought from the neighbourhood grocer to prepare the sweets was in fact teeming with plastic grains. On Tuesday, prof Ashok R Patil, a neighbour of the aggrieved family, complained to the food safety commissioner and health commissioner about the suspected plastic grains found in the sugar.The head of the family, SV Karki, had bought 5kg of sugar from Krishna Provision Store on Sunday. My wife made besan ladoos and some other sweets for my daughter who was set to leave for the US. We used up all the sugar. While tasting the ladoos, we realised it was impossible to bite into them. When we dissolved them in water, we could see transparent crystals settling down. I complained to the shopkeeper, said Karki.Prof Patil, chair professor of consumer law and practice, National Law School of India University, learnt about the matter and lodged the complaint  TOI has a copy  alleging that the sugar was adulterated with plastic grains.We informed the food safety officer to take action against the manufacturers and sellers involved. We have kept a sample of the sweet for lab test. The matter needs to be investigated further, said Patil. With the family having used all the sugar purchased from the store, theres no way to verify the extent of adulteration Maneesh Singh, proprietor of Krishna Provision Store, said he did not receive a complaint from any other customer. I buy a gunny bag of 50kg of sugar from the wholesale market, he said.However, Patil claimed the shopkeeper had admitted to some problem in the sugar when Karki questioned him.Dr Harshavardhan B, joint commissioner, Food Safety & Standard Authority of India (FSSAI), Karnataka, said he has received a complaint and his officers would inspect the store.If it is settling at the bottom of the vessel, it might not be plastic grains. They would float. We have received over 90 samples of rice and sugar in the past one month and in none of the cases was the presence of plastic grains proven. Testing samples for the presence of plastic grains costs Rs 6,000. The complainant has sent us an email. We will collect the sample and test it further, he said, adding that it could be a case of adulteration."

Vanaja, professor at RARS and Principal breeder of the first organic rice varieties. Grain production under the Kannippadam mission was estimated at 1,800 kg/acre, she said.While good straw production was another feature of the organic varieties used, cultivation expenditure had been reduced mainly owing to mechanisation. The estimated expenditure was Rs. 15,000 per acre, Dr. Vanaja added.Cost of productionAccording to RARS, approximately 40 women were required for harvesting and threshing paddy in one acre of land under the traditional system being practised by farmers.Total expenditure for manual labour would be Rs. 12,000 for harvesting and threshing alone, Dr. Vanaja said, adding that the use of combined harvester reduced the cost to Rs. 2,300. Moreover, the work would be over in an hour, she said. The net profit from cultivation in one acre is estimated to be Rs. 35,000.Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar inaugurated the harvest of rice cultivated under the Kannippadam mission at a function at Payyannur on October 30."

They fled their villages in Bijapur district, one of the worst affected by Naxalite violence in Chhattisgarh, in 2005, crossing the Indravati river to escape the crossfire between security forces and naxals.They [State administration] say the bridge has been approved, but funds are yet to be sanctioned. They are fooling us again, Mangluram Mandvi, a Moria tribesman, says. His family and 52 others have been living in a camp at Bangapala village.Salwa Judum daysFrom 2005 to 2007, Salwa Judum, a militia of villagers supported by the government, was fighting along with the security forces against the Naxalites.The people fled more out of fear of retribution by the troops.The paddy crop standing in the fields reminds Dhan Singh Puyam of those days. Just a few days from harvest, he fled with his mother, wife, one-year-old daughter and two brothers to Bangapala on the boundary of Bijapur and Dantewada. They had rice for just two meals. There were no boats. We waded through the river, with water reaching up to our chests. It was around 5 p.m. when we reached here, he recalls.The next day, the police served them food at the station. But only men were called. He had 15 acres of land back in his village. Now we work on other peoples lands to earn a living, he says.Camp lifeThe people say they have become inured to life in camps. Back home, there are no hospitals, schools or angandwadis. To go to weekly markets, they have to cross the river on boats, a next-to-impossible task during rain. The camp is dotted with dish antennas, and every third person has a mobile phone. Outside, solar power runs borewells all day long.We have no enmity with the naxals, but if the bridge is constructed, we are sure they will have to leave, Mr. Puyam says.About a kilometre away on another camp site, a few people, especially those who could not find viable employment, have started trickling back.My fathers elder brother and his wife, they are old and had nothing here. About a year ago, they returned to their village across the river, says Kalicharan pointing at the direction of the village.He was five when his family fled Belanar village, and now he just completed his 12th standard. He does not want to go back.This time of the year, the river is thin and its banks are being hollowed out with truck after truck carrying away sand.The camp residents are politically vocal. They want change. For the past 15 years, the Raman Singh government has been minting money; now someone else should get a chance, they say.There are 23 relief camps in Dantewada."

The normal area of samba paddy cultivation in Thiruverumbur taluk is 18,350 acres, the joint director of agriculture K Balraj said.Kuvalakudi, Natarajapuram, Theneripatti, Asoor, Keelakuruchi and Vengur have been selected under the scheme in Thiruverumbur taluk, the joint director added.R Srinivasan, 56, a progressive farmer from Ariyamangalam has cultivated paddy using SRI methodology on 13 acres in the district. For paddy, SRI is the best method to get high yield, he said. Srinivasan was the first to successfully take up cultivation by adopting SRI in Trichy. It has proved that it is the best-ever method to earn more, he added. He adopts the same method for pulses too.The system is an effective method to overcome the looming water crisis as paddy is a water intensive crop. As the method has been proven to be the best for good yield in rice production, adopting the method is the need of the hour, district collector K Rajamani said.As per the field experiments conducted to compare rice production using modified methods of irrigation, planting, weeding and nutrient management against conventional methods, SRI has proven to be the better option, the collector said, appealing farmers to adopt the method for better production while having to spending less.To divert pests and insects away from paddy crops, agriculture officials have advocated bund cropping. Planting a variety of flowering plants will attract pests and insects away which pose threat to paddy crops, the collector added."

Otherwise, not only do you lose on nutrition but there are also chances the food may turn toxic, leading to several disorders and illnesses. Lets take a closer look at the cookware used in Indian kitchens.Chopping boardMost people use a plastic one but the problem with plastic boards, even branded ones, is that chopping creates grooves that can harbour harmful microbes such as E. coli and salmonella. These germs get into cooked food via the next lot of sliced vegetables. Contamination is even more likely if the same board is used to chop meat or chicken. Worse, these bugs are so stubborn that even cooking may not kill them. Switch to wooden or rubber chopping boards and replace them every year.Aluminium utensilsBecause these vessels are oxidised, there is little chance of the aluminium leaching into food. Aluminium wrap, on the other hand, can leach metal if the food stays in it too long, especially if the dish has tomato, lemon juice or vinegar. A study in the Journal of Alzheimers Disease reported cases in which leached aluminium had led to Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases at a relatively young age. The US-based Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry (ATSDR) features aluminium prominently on its list of 200 toxic items. Switch to packing food in parchment paper. Wax-coated parchment paper is as effective as aluminium foil.Non-stick cookwareThese are extremely useful as they aid low-fat cooking and are easy to clean. The non-stick coating debuted as Teflon, which was later followed by several clones. In recent times, some of these new materials have been found to be associated with a host of diseases such as dyslexia and infertility. Improper use of these utensils compounds the problem. For instance, cooking over high heat or damaged coating can make these pans unsafe. You should use non-stick pans with great care or sparingly.Stainless steel vesselsQuality stainless steel looks good and there is barely any leaching. What there is  iron, manganese or chromium  can actually take care of possible mineral deficiencies. However, one ingredient is harmful  nickel. Dont scratch the utensil with scrubbing aids such as steelwool. A scarred surface would leach nickel.Iron woksTo me, iron pans may look ugly and, sometimes, the food you cook in it becomes black, especially if you cook sour items. But even if iron does get leached into food, its good for those who have anaemia. However, if any family member suffers from blood disorders such as polycythaemia and thalassaemia, iron in food can be harmful.PlasticwareHot food in a plastic container can get contaminated with the material, leading to heart diseases, infertility, some brain ailments and even cancer. A recent Harvard research also showed that BPA  found in certain types of plastics, especially that used to make water bottles  plays a key role in weight gain. Melamine is not as bad as plastic but it too gives off toxic substances when it comes in touch with steaming hot food. Do not use melamine containers to heat food in a microwave (even if labelled for use in microwaves).CeramicwareThis is perhaps the best cookware material. It can withstand high heat and be used in an oven, a microwave and even broiler. It is also good looking.Bone china and porcelainThese products are light and pleasing to the eyes. They can be used to heat food in the oven but are best used to serve food in. However, some porcelainware is embellished with gold or silver. Such pieces cannot be used in the microwave. The only problem: chinaware is fragile and needs careful handling.Earthenware and stonewareIn olden times, rice was cooked in earthenware. But earthenware as well as stoneware are liable to crack with sudden changes in temperature. Some people use stoneware crockery. However, you cannot use earthenware or stoneware in microwave ovens."

Ramila Umashankar, as they were not in the right frame of mind and were upset.A few others, who are diabetic, did not have food, as they dont have rice and prefer ragi mudde or chapati, he said.He also said there have been demands from councillors and the general public on introducing ragi mudde and chapati on the menu in the Indira Canteens, apart from tea and coffee. The whole intention of getting food from Indira Canteen was to ascertain if the quality needs any improvement. As councillors, it is our responsibility to ensure that quality food is served to the general public in the city, he said.The BBMP will get food from the Indira Canteens for the council meeting scheduled on October 31. It remains to be seen if there will be more takers that day.Ramila rememberedThe council condoled the passing away of Deputy Mayor R. Ramila Umashankar. She died of a cardiac arrest on October 5 days after being elected as Deputy Mayor. Councillors, cutting across party lines, recalled how she worked for the electorate in her ward (Kaveripura), her resourcefulness and their interaction with her.

Village Child Development Centre (VCDC) Scheme2. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for PDS3. DBT for Tribal Ashram Shalas4. Public Health SchemesDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityThe BJP government in the state spent the last four years announcing social sector schemes  each more ambitious than the other  at a rapid pace, but the public reaction has been far from uniform. In other words, the government's social sector sops have been a mixed bag.Its blood on call' scheme earned bouquets, but its announcement to provide premix food as children's meal got widespread flak for being unimaginative. Its decision to introduce direct benefit transfers in the public distribution scheme was trashed, but beneficiaries of the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule insurance scheme have been ecstatic to get angioplasty costing lakhs for free.The budget also reveals a worrisome trend: allocations for schemes have been slashed or the private sector has been roped in areas that have traditionally been the domain of the government sector.An analysis of state budgets from 2015-16 to 2017-18 by Jaganyachya Hakkache Andolan showed consistent failure of Maharashtras government to allocate adequate funds for social sector, despite a deep agrarian crisis and peoples undeniable need for social services. There is continued and deliberate massive underspending of allocated funds, said health economist Dr Ravi Duggal. Only 40% of allocated funds were spent by February 14, 2018, a few days from the close of the financial year.Heres a performance report:The women and child development department launched a Rs 100-crore scheme to fight malnourishment after the Centre stopped funds three years ago. The scheme envisaged giving children in villages premix food thrice a day  an idea health experts felt would not be popular. This was the third time in as many years that the ministry was caught in a storm. In June 2015, minister Pankaja Munde courted controversy for clearing purchase of chikki , mats and books for Rs 206 crore without floating tenders. The next year it emerged that the department's Take Home Ration scheme distributed packets of sheera or upma to womenfar from a balanced diet. Dr Ashish Satav, who works in the tribal-dominated Melghat area, said the VCDC scheme should be scrapped. It does not administer WHO-UNICEF recommended diet or micronutrients, said Dr Satav. Unless we know the real figure of malnutrition, appropriate measures cannot be planned to reduce child deaths.The state decided to implement the DBT scheme as part of the public distribution system (PDS) in two ration shops in the city with 1,400 Antyodaya and priority household ration cardholders as an experiment. The Food Security Act entitles the neediest families in the country to 35kg of grain at heavily subsidized rates per month under the Antyodaya scheme, while each member of a priority household is entitled to 5kg. Both have to pay Rs3 for a kg of rice and Rs2 for a kg of wheat. The social organization Anna Adhikar Manch slammed the scheme, alleging that it is a step towards dismantling the PDS system. This is a ghoshnabaaj sarkar. The scheme has amounted to diluting food security, which was guaranteed to the poor after a long agitation. The cash transfer business is part of doing away with PDS and also do away with buying grains from farmers for FCI godowns by providing them a minimum support price, said activist Ulka Mahajan.The state implemented DBT in tribal ashram schools. It was meant for the purchase of 17 essentials items like toiletries so that these reach them directly instead through a contractor. The state has started transferring cash to students bank accounts as food allowance or scholarship (for hostel students). The state said the scheme has 4.14 lakh beneficiaries, with Rs 1,474 crore spent till date. As of now, it is being implemented in only 120 out of 491 hostels, located in the jurisdiction of corporations and districts. Minister for tribal welfare Vishnu Savara claimed this was being done to put an end to the constant complaints of poor quality of items reaching tribal children. Rajendra Maraskolhe, president, Organisation for Rights of Tribals, said the scheme is good, but needs awareness among tribals. The tribal community is different. They still hesitate to mix with others; so, they are not aware about how to spend the money. The state should consider counselling them, he said.The government flagged off many schemes, but the blood on call' program seems to be the most popular one, with experts and critics acknowledging that it fills a yawning gap in the public health system . The government's bike ambulances have also met with positive response, but these have a limited role and cannot do much in big crises, said Dr Abhijit More of the NGO Jan Arogya Abhiyan. The free health insurance scheme Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana has been the government's most visible scheme for the masses as it provides free access to 1,000 surgeries that cost up to Rs 1.5 lakh. This year, after the Centres Ayushman Bharat scheme was launched, the benefit has climbed to Rs 5 lakh. But some economists are not happy. There have been complaints of patients still not getting proper access. Until a few months back, some hospitals made patients pay extra, said one. The biggest criticism, according to Dr More, is that the scheme is only dedicated towards surgeries. What about hospitalisation due to chronic diseases? We get calls from people across the state to enquire if hospitalisation could be covered under the scheme, he said. It's time to revamp the scheme and make it more broad-based."

The SC registry deposited the cash into the accounts of the victims of the regressive practice of bonded labour. The cash was given by the convicts to secure their bail.The SC had, on September 21, 2017, issued an order stating that the bail applications of the two convicts in the case, K Sivakumar and Munusamy Naidu, would be considered only if they handed over 75 lakh to the court registry on or before October 6 the same year.The amount paid by them was deposited into the accounts of the victims on a pro rata basis. They were rescued on August 9, 2005 from a rice mill by revenue officials, who acted upon the information from IJM, an NGO.The rescued bonded labours were informed about the cash deposits three days ago. ""We were surprised when my uncle (Ramalingam) told us that 4.75 lakh was deposited in his account. I checked my account and found the account balance had increased to 4,77,061 lakh from 2,061,"" said 28 year-old Chinnarasu, who was rescued along with his parents, Malliga and Mari.Recalling the days in the rice mill in Kadambattur village in Tiruvallur district , Malliga, 42, said it was ""nightmare"" and they were treated like animals. ""They beat my husband with slippers for not working for long hours. Unable to bear the humiliation, he ran away from the mill. Hence, the owners of the mills forced our elder son (Chinnarasu) who was then 15 years to work,"" she said.They worked for 10 to 12 hours a day and had been paid around 250 per family every three days, said Malliga, who now works under the MNREGA scheme.The revenue officials had filed a case against owners Kandasamy Mudaliar, his son Sivakumar and their manager Munusamy under various sections of IPC and Bonded Labourer System (Abolition) Act. The Tiruvallur district's fast-track court, on May 18,2010, awarded five years rigorous imprisonment and imposed fine ranging from Rs 26,000 to 52,000 for them.Though the trio approached the Madras high court against the verdict in the lower court, it upheld the judgment in June, 2017. Following this, they approached the SC for bail. Welcoming the SC's direction, activists said it would set a precedent for all cases of bonded and forced labourer."

Later, the same persons will blame the Lt Gov office for not giving free rice to the poor. The elected reps (representatives) must share with people why the Lt Governor has returned this proposal, she said.Bedi asserted that her office protects the interests of the poor for whom the money is meant and ensures that money allotted for the poor is not diverted.I am amazed how many of the liars are getting away from one lie to the other. And we have chosen some of them to represent us. To save ongoing exploitation of the common people here in Puducherry, there is an urgent need for a lie detector system. If one party alleges, alleging parties must submit. This will be fair to people at large and contain the growth of lies and check the moral decline we are currently facing in Puducherry, she said.Bedi insisted on a technological solution to the issue. Countering lies in Puducherry is the real challenge in serving Puducherry. For protecting common peoples protection. People need to understand who is lying. And misleading them. Insiders or outsider. I am an outsider serving u as long as President of India wants. Whatever Lt Gov is doing is for largest interest not the few, she said.She said beginning with the private medical colleges' issue she has been investing time daily countering lies.The mistakes made were corrected by the judiciary right up to the Supreme Court, at a heavy cost of time, money and agony. It is not in everyones capacity to do. Hence common people suffer. We need to catch lies before they bear weeds and take root in peoples minds. I as Lt Gov could expose these weeds because I fortunately had/ have direct access to information which ordinary citizens did and do not have. I deem it my duty to counter. Or we will give walkovers to the liars and exploitation will continue and increase, she said."

The mill owner did not produce any document pertaining to the purchase of paddy,"" Singla said.""Prima facie, this appears to be an attempt to sell paddy purchased at cheaper rates from other states in Punjab mandis. The modus operandi is to arrange a bogus auction of such paddy, which is purchased from other states at about Rs 800 to Rs 900 and sell in Punjab mandis at MSP of Rs 1,770 and earn a direct profit from the transaction as well as commission on selling it (during procurement by government agencies),"" he pointed out.Officials said that the Punjab Food and Civil Supplies Department, through a series of raids over the past month, has recovered nearly 2.5 lakh bags of paddy and 2 lakh bags of the previous year's rice which was set to be pumped into Punjab this Kharif season (2018-19)."

The organizers had targeted to treat around 60,000 patients, but received 42,155 registrations.While patients were registered across all faculties, several of them had to return home without treatment, with assurances of being contacted within two days.Jagdish Nagar resident and a heart patient Vijay Ramdas Kamble passed away at the camp. After being taken to GMCH, he was declared brought dead. A post-mortem was not conducted as the relatives took the body for funeral. Since midnight, his health had worsened.

Perhaps, he was contemplating the next item on his agenda.Asked how the campaign was going and whether the BJP stands a chance of recording an upset, Yeddyurappa said: We are certain to win Shivamogga and Ballari, but we will give a tough fight in Mandya.For over six decades, politics in the rice and sugar bowl of the state has been a sort of turf war between the Congress and JD(S). Voters loyalties have swung only between these two parties. However, for the first time, the pre-poll alliance between the archrivals has opened the door for the BJP to make inroads in the Vokkaliga heartland.State intelligence reports suggest the BJP is set to gain a foothold in Mandya even if its candidate is defeated. Reports say the swing may be comparable to the 1994 elections when the Ayodhya and Ram Janma Bhoomi issues swung a lot of votes for the saffron outfit.However, Yeddyurappas statement that the BJP stands more than a chance is far removed from facts on the ground, with every village and town in the constituency reaffirming its loyalty to the JD(S) and the tallest Vokkaliga leader in the state, H D Deve Gowda. However, some are considering the BJP as an alternative, thanks to the void left by the Congress.In Thatahalli, 82-year-old Chinne Gowda, puffing on a beedi outside his home, reflected on loyalty to the JD(S). It does not matter who the candidate is, we are going to vote for Dala (colloquial name for JDS), he said. Previously, we had voted for Congress when the JD(S) failed to deliver on its promises. However, considering the stature of Deve Gowda and his ability to deliver on promises, we have always come back.However, in Koppa, some 15km away, staunch Congress workers say the decision of the partys high command to surrender the seat to the JD(S), has undermined their efforts in the constituency. They say their younger colleagues could shift to the saffron party.With local leaders not spelling out clearly whether to work for the JD(S), a lot of Congress sympathisers have openly declared they will vote for the BJP, said a senior Mandya Congress worker. Local Congress leaders fear their party could be wiped out in Mandya. They say it is possible their substantial vote base could be handed on a platter to the JD(S).With the JD(S) sweeping Mandya district in the assembly polls earlier this year  the party won all eight segments by margins ranging between 30,000 and 50,000 Congress leaders are peeved with the alliance that has been forced on them by its high command.Congress losing candidates and former JD(S) MLAs Ramesh Babu Bandisiddegowda and N Cheluvarayaswamy are not campaigning as no invitation was extended to them. Their supporters have only been holding indoor meetings.Making it even easier for the BJP to expand its voter base is the choice of L R Shivarame Gowda as the alliance candidate. The alliances choice of candidate is not good and it will help us, said Yeddyurappa, reflecting on the popular thought in Mandya that Shivarame Gowdas name had figured in the alleged murder of a journalist. The wave of discontent has been so strong that chief minister H D Kumaraswamy has been forced to defend Shivarame Gowda at every election rally.Every media house carried a report on the 22-yearold case and of Shivarame Gowda being a murder accused, said Kumaraswamy at a rally in Maddur. However, he has been acquitted by the judiciary. If the disgruntlement is simply because he was jailed, then let us remind the people that even Yeddyurappa and other BJP leaders have also gone to jail.The murdered journalist was from the Kuruba community which has more than two lakh voters in the constituency. The BJP is expecting to swing these voters to their fold."

The water was collected from the bore well using the generator sets, and started distributing it to people. I did it with the support of local people after watching the sufferings of people. But, we had not expected that chief minister would felicitate us for our work.A Gajapati village sarpanch Padma Nayak described how he, along with a village-level government official Minati Mishra, reached the interior areas hit by Titli carrying the relief material. As we could provide relief to the people in time, many precious lives were saved, said Padma.The cyclone, which was expected to cause major damage in the coastal belt, had taken the state administration by surprise leaving a trail of death and destruction in interior districts such as Gajapati, Kandhamal and Ganjam. As many as 77 persons died in the cyclone. The state government has asked for an interim relief of Rs 1,000 crore to take up relief and restoration work in the affected areas. It has also sought Rs 2,014 corre from the National Disaster Response Fund."

Many fuss over fever, ignoring signs of dehydration. Increasingly, most patients, particularly children who are brought to hospital after their fever does not subside within 48-72 hours, suffer from acute dehydration, said Dr A T Arasar Seelar, director of Institute of Child Health and Hospital.The aches and fever are a sign that the bodys immune system is fighting the micro-organisms including viruses that cause dengue and H1N1 This can make a person, particularly children, dehydrated, he said. Urine gets darker and the output is reduced. If the output is less than four times a day, its a sign that the child is critically ill and needs immediate attention to prevent shock, he said.Drinking fluids can reduce headaches and bolster immune response because the protein is carried via bodily fluids and dehydration hampers it. Its one reason grandmas would recommend soups, rasams or rice porridge when nursing the ill. Sick people too may crave watery fruits like mausambi or tender coconut, said director of public health Dr Kolandaswamy. He has sent an advisory note to doctors telling them why its critical to maintain adequate hydration from the beginning of dengue or other fevers.More patients are treated as outpatients. Domiciliary care is good, but doctors should take time to talk to patients about hydration, Dr Kolandaswamy said. In dengue the virus ultimately targets vascular endothelium, platelets and various organs leading to blood vessel damage responsible for the development of haemorrhage and shock.With adequate fluids, toxic substances get diluted and cause mild damage and less complications. Even if some complications occur, it can be reversed easily with appropriate treatment. But when toxic substances get concentrated, even with best treatment it becomes difficult to reverse the complications and save the patient, he said."

Picture by Bishwarup DuttaA model highlighting the potential of producing furniture and a pens plastic body from rice husk was adjudged the Hult Prize 2018 champion at the IIT Kharagpur on Sunday.The Hult Prize, in association with The Telegraph, is an annual competition that collates idea from students after challenging them to solve a pressing social issue revolving around topics such as food security, water access, energy, environment and education.At the two-day event that started on Saturday, more than 50 teams from IIT Kharagpur vied for the top spot with their start-up ideas on social enterprise before a panel of six judges.Former US president Bill Clinton selects the challenge topic and announces the winner every September.Team Metal, comprising four IIT students, topped the list with their sustainable model that is expected to create a social enterprise impacting the lives of tens of thousands of people, the judges said.The Hult Prize named after the international business school that has campuses in London and San Francisco collates ideas through which budding entrepreneurs strive to create social enterprises that would impact the lives of 10 million people by 2025.The panel scanned six models before selecting the one by Metal.India is a leading paddy producing country and if stuff like pen, furniture, pitch board and kitchenware can be produced on a large scale from rice husk, it could reduce the problem of plastic consumption, Harshit Garg, member of Metal and a student of the five-year integrated geo physics and geology course, said.We are pouring adhesive and chemical in the rice husk to produce a roll of sheet. That sheet can be used to produce the body of ball pen, kitchenware and pitch boards, Garg said.The team has developed the prototype and has two third-year students of chemical engineering department providing them with technical support.China uses rice husk to produce the plastic tiffin boxes.When the judges sought to know what was the job prospect of their model, Shivendra Gautam, another team member said, the assembly line could generate tens of thousands of jobs.Team Tillagers model focusing on creating a direct supply chain between farmers and retailers curtailing the role of middlemen stood second.Sandeep Kumar, associate partner, Mckinsey and Company, who was one of the judges, said the event stood out as the participants came up with models with an innovative approach and sought to take care of challenges facing the society.Vinod Sood, MD, Hughes Systique Corporation, another judge said the event stood out because the students came up out-of-the-box and diverse ideas.Nancy Charaya, COO, Anthill Creations and a Tedx speaker, said: There was a social angle to each presentation and that was commendable.Team Metal will represent IIT Kharagpur at the regional round in March 2019, Harsh Goyel, IIT campus director for the Hult Prize, said.The regional round will be held in several places, including in London and Boston.The winning team at the world final in September 2019 at the United Nations will get a seed capital of $1 million in collaboration with the Bill Clinton Foundation to sustainably solve the worlds most critical social challenges."

The findings also revealed that rice residue contributes 56% of the total PM 2.5 emission, and wheat residue contribute 32%. While for PM 10 emissions, 56% is comes from rice and 22% from wheat residues.This is the first such inventory of crop residue burning emissions including greenhouse gases (GHG) and various air pollutants prepared by the School of Public health in PGIMER. The results of the inventory have been recently published in a high-impact Journal of Cleaner Production.The study, Emissions of air pollutants from primary crop residue burning in India and their mitigation strategies for cleaner emission, has been authored by Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, Dr Tanbir Singh and Dr Suman Mor from PGIMER and department of environmental studies, Panjab University.Using available data and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines, the researchers documented that last year, one fourth of the crop residue generated was burnt in the open agricultural fields.As the crop production increased from 476 metric tonnes to 618 metric tonnes, since 2003-2004 to 2016-2017, the crop residues burnt rose by 1.3 times from 89 metric tonnes.Indian agriculture accounts for 12.2% of worlds total GHG emissions. These emissions can be avoided if crop residue can be utilized in biomass power plants to generate electricity, said Dr Suman.Rice and wheat contributed maximum to crop waste residue, which is 63% of total crop primary residue. The inventory gives crop-wise waste residue contribution where rice is the highest at 43%, wheat 26%, sugarcane 10%, and coarse cereals 11%.The inventory is a database which will help to know the extent of air pollution due to crop burning. Accordingly, steps to mitigate the emissions can be taken, said Dr Khaiwal.Also, the carcinogenic emissions from the crop residue burning increases with increase in the values of PM 2.5 and PM 10. This decline in the air quality adversely impacts the health.Former national president of Indian Medical Association Dr K K Aggarwal said, The particulate matter results in inflammation of the respiratory tract. Now, we are more concerned about the indoor pollution as its too tough to regulate the outer pollution.The report concluded that if all crop residue will be used for energy production, it can account for 10% of current energy production in the country. We have done systemic reviews on how to mitigate farm fire by use of technology, non-technical ways and policy issues, said Dr Khaiwal.Despite the Punjab government's two-year plan under which it would be spending Rs 665 crore on providing straw management machinery, there has been a rise in fire farms. In 2015-16, the residue burnt in the country was 110.05 metric tonnes which was 116.82 metric tonnes in 2016-2017."

Hugh Jackman falls into the first category, as witnessed when he recently settled into a well-positioned banquette in a West Village restaurant and faced his dining audience, the better to disarm and dazzle.But his latest character  former United States Senator Gary Hart of Colorado  is definitely not a fan of the limelight. In The Front Runner, the director Jason Reitman chronicles the three weeks in 1987 when the presidential candidacy of Hart, a Democrat who was considered the man to beat, imploded after journalists caught the scent of a supposed extramarital tryst with Donna Rice. It didnt take long before that infamous photo of Rice sitting on Harts lap near the Monkey Business yacht was splashed across the National Enquirer. (Both Hart and Rice have denied an affair. And earlier this month, The Atlantic reported that a dying Lee Atwater  the campaign manager for George H.W. Bush, the presumed Republican candidate, who trailed in the polls  claimed that he had set Hart up.)Gary is a private person by nature but also a believer that there should be a separation between the public and private lives of politicians, said Jackman. And what I love about the movie is it does not give any easy answers on that. Were all human, weve all got flaws, but what level of flaws would you accept? Its actually Garys line: In public life some things are interesting; it doesnt necessarily mean theyre important.Jackman, on the other hand, seems to have no obvious shortcomings: His offscreen persona is that of a happy husband to the Australian actress Deborra-lee Furness and a doting father to their teenagers, Oscar and Ava, who sings in the shower and makes his best decisions while tap dancing.On the day before his 50th birthday  which he would celebrate with his wifes ricotta hot cakes before heading to the set of Bad Education, about an embezzlement scandal in a Long Island school district  Jackman talked about politics and privacy, whats next for The Greatest Showman and why his life just keeps getting better.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.What was it like being cast as Gary Hart?It produced a little anxiety in the right kind of way. I mean, nerve-racking for many reasons  [Gary] is mysterious, hard to pin down, closed off. Even he said, People call me cold and aloof but if I start winning theyll call me enigmatic. Then of course Ive never played someone whos alive. But I feel very strongly that our stories are one of the most valuable things to people. How were seen in the world, potentially how were remembered. And I wanted him to know that I took that very seriously.Before Hart, presidents had affairs but the news media mostly left them alone. What changed?This was really a key turning point, particularly in the relationship between press and politicians, and also politics and personality. Once the private life became a really important indicator of character, and something that voters and press could latch onto to describe their worthiness to lead, then the floodgates opened. Its the most important job in the world, arguably, and you are making a decision about the character of someone in terms of what they say theyre going to do. For me, how they conduct their marriage is not that important.In 2017, with Logan, you retracted your Wolverine claws after 17 years, a decision which you credited to Jerry Seinfeld.I was asking him about the end of Seinfeld, and he said: Im a firm believer that its very important for your creative self not to run your self ragged. Leave before youre completely worn out on something because it catapults into the next thing. As he was telling me the story, I just knew in my gut it was time.After which you made your passion project, The Greatest Showman, about P.T. Barnum, which became a box-office smash. Will there be a Broadway version?I dont know. Its not definitive at all. Theres a lot of people working on what a live version of that would be. Is it something thats on the West End or in Vegas? Is it a touring tent show? Is it an arena spectacular? All I know is when we were in the room during those workshops, you get a really keen sense if its going to work in a theatre. And I know it will work. I just know the power. Ive seen Keala [Settle] standing in the centre of a room singing This Is Me, and there was not a dry eye in the house.Agency pictureOr maybe a film sequel?Im sure there are pitches being done but I have no idea whats going on.What is 50 like?For me, life feels better and better. People talk a lot about the arrogance of youth and how the world is at your feet, and I didnt really relate to that. I felt more insecure certainly than I do now. But a bit of insecurity is good. It makes you work harder.Is there anything youd like to do that youre not ready for yet?Hmm, no. Maybe I am arrogant. Because Im promoting this movie, people are like, Wow, are you going to run for prime minister [of Australia]? [Laughs] And Im like, No, thats not happening. Any job where the day you sign up literally 60 per cent of the country hates you, I dont know if Id be able to cope with that.Its hard to imagine 60 per cent of any country hating you. After all, 20.8 million followers enjoy watching you make fun of yourself on Instagram.I do try to hold onto the bubbly colloquial Aussie way of not taking things too seriously. I know its probably breaking all the movie star rules where youre supposed to be mysterious and not show who you really are, but I really dont care that much about it. I prefer to do my pretending on film or on stage."

With former Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Ajit Jogi joining hands with Mayawati to contest elections in the state, Singh feels that he is a formidable opponent and will have an impact on some seats.Raman Singh promises to focus on improving social indicators in the state in the next five years if he wins. He launched his election campaign on Saturday from Naxal-infested and tribal-dominated Bastar region, that goes to poll on November 12.After 15 years of rule, will anti-incumbency be a major factor?I covered over 12,000 kms during my Chhattisgarh yatra across 90 constituencies and I did not find anti-incumbency anywhere. It is instead pro-incumbency because the kind of work we have done in the state is something that no one had thought of. We are in Geedam (Dantewada) today which has created history in the field of education.The focus of the Prime Minister, President and Chhattisgarh government has been to ensure development in special districts like Dantewada, Bijapur and (other) backward districts. These districts are core to the governments development planning. We have succeeded in providing health and education infrastructure and will keep focussing on these areas as this is our strength and power.Do you think Ajit Jogi will be a key player in deciding who forms the government?I think Congress is the main rival of the BJP, but in over 24 seats, the Jogi-led alliance is a formidable force. No one should be underestimated.What are the issues on the basis of which you are seeking votes?We are reaching out to the people of Chhattisgarh through the development work we have done and our plan for the next five years. The power sector has been our major focus area and we are ensuring the availability of electricity for all. In so many decades, Congress governments never did the kind of work that our government is doing.Whether it is our Public Distribution System, road infrastructure, increased rates for paddy procurement, bonus for crops or education, we have fulfilled all the promises that we made to the people of the state to ensure a better life for them.Under health insurance, we provided guaranteed insurance cover of Rs 50,000 and now under Ayushman Bharat, Rs 500,000 health cover has been assured. So all the major steps are being taken in various areas and will benefit us in the Assembly elections.The BJP is focussing on Mission 65, do you expect to get the numbers?I am confident that we will fare better than the previous three Assembly elections and sweep in all 11 constituencies in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. I am sure BJP will form the government both in the state and at the Centre.This time, our focus is on getting 65 seats. Last time we got left behind due to few seats because of a small margin of votes in the Dantewada area.Is Naxalism in Bastar hampering Chhattisgarhs progress?Travel in any (Naxal-hit) districts like Sukma, Dantewada. Go anywhere, there is nothing. Its just written about in books and shown on TV. These are very good people and believe in simple living. Girls travel on a scooter in Dantewada even at midnight.There cant be better people than that of Bastar. Globally everyone is talking about the development in Dantewada and everyone wants to come here.What will be the focus of your government if voted for fourth time?It is just a start and there were a lot of problems that we had been focussing on. My focus will also be to present Chhattisgarh as a developed state before the country and for that, we have to walk miles. I want social indicators like Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate and malnutrition in the state to go down.Chhattisgarh is among the top states as far as infrastructure is concerned and we will also make it best in area of social infrastructure. We will keep walking and fighting till we achieve our goals."

For one, it will bring her a step closer to an age-old ingredient her mother-in-law swore by  cow dung  a natural disinfectant and pest repellent. While the practice of cleaning the home with it may have become tedious to follow in this day and age of gated urban dwelling, for Anusha, a close alternative has come in the form of cow dung diyas. ""Its an opportunity to incorporate a traditional ingredient into our modern lifestyle. Whats even better is that some of these diyas come loaded with ghee, which means I dont have to spend hours filling them with oil,"" she says.The diyas have been manufactured by Mumbai-based entrepreneur S Kalyanaraman under his marketing platform The Zero Brand Zone. Kalyanaraman developed the technology in July 2017 and filed the patent for it in December. His technsology combines panchakaviyam  the traditional mixture of cow dung, cow urine, milk, curd and ghee  with a natural binding mixture of cow butter, neem, peepal and lemon tree leaves. The mixture is put under pressure and heated to 100 degrees to produce lamps.Even as he awaits the grant for the patent, Mumbai-based NGO We Change, decided to market The Zero Brand Zones dung diyas through social media earlier this month. Besides being thriftily priced at an average of `4 a piece, the diyas burn away along with the wick, leaving zero toxic residue and keeping insects at bay.""In over a week that we started marketing these lamps, we have received orders for 1,50,000 diyas from across the globe. We have bookings for the next one year,"" says Sridhar Lokanathan, founder of We Change.We Change is now in the process of manufacturing its own range of cow dung diyas that would be ""completely vegan"", made without the panchakaviyam. ""Were making our diyas with different natural binding agents and rice flour. Since we began promoting cow dung diyas, goshalas, farmers and individuals taking care of abandoned cows have been reaching out to us. The prototype of our product is almost ready and we plan to unveil our first batch around mid-December,"" says Sridhar. He adds that the diyas would also also come as a solution to farmers forced to sell their cows to slaughterhouses once they stop milking.Kalyanaraman too has been working with farmers from various states. ""There are close to 5,000 people from the villages who have found employment creating these lamps,"" he says.Today, most of the clay lamps stocked in stores arent made of pure clay, but fortified using chemical additives in order to extend their shelf life, says researcher and managing trustee of Chennai-based Care Earth Trust Jayshree Vencatesan. ""In this regard, cow dung lamps are a better alternative. This is a welcome step towards reviving a tradition thats also easy on the environment,"" she says."

What was different this year?Have you had the chance to step out and eat street food in Delhi?How does Indian food stand from the innovation perspective?Any Indian dish you would want to reinvent?Which Indian dish do you make the most at home?Is there still some Indian dish that you havent tried yet?Download The Times of India News App for Latest CityGary Mehigan first visited India way back in 2012, and it has been a continued love affair since then. The Australian chef, who is one of the judges on the widely popular MasterChef Australia show, was in India recently to celebrate the countrys culinary culture as part of the Australia Fest. He travelled to Mumbai and Delhi, judging Mystery Box Challenges and holding masterclasses. From how Indian food has evolved over the years to his favourite Indian dish to make when at home (the answer will surprise you) and even a little nugget of info about the history of biryani in the country  he spoke to us about all that he loves about desi food.The Indian food is really stepping up on the world stage. You have got a lot of regional diversity in India, but around the world, there is a very limited range of Indian dishes, and people see it as a homogeneous cuisine. But now, Indian chefs have been travelling, and when they come back, they do incredible things locally  especially the young chefs. They are doing things differently, they have got experience that they are applying it to local, sustainable and indigenous food here. The next step is the export and that needs new intellectual properties, creative ideas. I think the world is realising that there is a huge amount of creativity, diversity.Whats exciting about the food that Loki Madireddi and Sashi Cheliah (who won the season) cooked this year is that Australians love spice, they love sweet, sour, salty. And like Indians, they love crunch too. Crunch is a major part in what drives our taste. A simple chaat for example, you know, we have got samosa chaat or chhole bhature, they are quite new to most Australians. We dont see that kind of thing a lot, its very traditional, even if they are given a new twist. They are really complex and delicious and they appeal to the Australian sense of taste. We love hot food, we love chilli, a lot of south east Asian food and Indian food really appeal to Australians. So I think thats why the contestants did so well this year.I have actually had quite a lot of street food, and the dumplings  momos  is high on the list for me. They are always a must. I have also been to couple of restaurants in Delhi. I like all of the very traditional, staple dishes  the paani puri, the bhature, chaat. I love dosa masala. Some of the desserts. My wife is visiting for the first time this year, and so is my daughter. So they went out and had a lot of street food  gulab jamun and jalebi, and this dessert made from chickpea flour and jaggery  is it called laddoo? These things are a little addictive, so maybe theyll turn me into a diabetic, but they are very delicious!I think innovation tends to happen in the big cities. So Mumbai, Maharashtra, is like the epicenter I suppose for cosmopolitan dining  but dont tell Delhi that, dont tell Calcutta that, because everyone will get upset (laughs). But from the traditional perspective, I am a massive fan of south Indian cuisine, particularly Kerala and Chennai. I like Kerala-style fish curry, that are really kind of dark and red, its delicious, but I also like the subtleties of south Indian food. I like the rice cakes  the idlis, the appams. And I love I suppose the familiarity of the coconut cream, lime or lemon, curry leaves. I had a beautiful goat curry with a creamy cashew sauce with green cardamom and clove. So even though I like the big spicy dishes from the north, like Rajasthan, going south is kind of refreshing and the kind of food that I really enjoy eating every day.Oooh, reinvention of an Indian dish... You know the south India podi, those powders  I love those. I make a couple of different podi at home, and they are probably not traditional at all. And I play around with things like the galouti, which is like a very traditional dish. The galouti spices in itself are really delicious, and dont have to be in galouti. So I use them for other things like roast chicken because I love that combination of rose petal, clove, mace, the different spices, that lend themselves to lots of different things. There is also a black pepper chicken, a south Indian dish, that I picked up the recipe for  black pepper, a little bit of chilli, fennel seeds, yogurt, curry leaves and cashew paste. And I make that dish all the time and I play around with it at home.I like butter chicken (laughs). Last time I came to Delhi, I think every restaurant I went to, they wanted to give me their version of butter chicken. So I got a pretty good idea of whats good and whats not good. So I make butter chicken, I make that black pepper chicken a lot. I make dosa, I make a really rich lamb curry and we make biryani often. I have had a couple of different types of biryani over the years. I have had a rice-less Irani biryani. Apparently, when the Persians brought biryani to India, Indians added the rice. I never knew that.Wow, there are too many to even mention. The food in northeast India is completely different because it is in the border of China and there are a lot of different influences. So I look at that and I go wow, I havent been there. I want to go to Kashmir as well. So theres lots to see and lots to experience. Sharmila.

RLSP has 10% vote share in the state, but it is still being given just 2-3 seats. Our party is not a slave to any other party as we have our own mass reach in the state.

The cases were even higher in 2016 as 1,240 incidents were reported in the year.Aggarwal provided the information during a meeting with principal secretary (Sports) Sanjay Kumar and other officers at Bachat Bhawan.The DC said, The district administration is making extra efforts to ensure that farmers are educated about the ill-effects of burning of paddy straw. To keep constant vigil over the issue, nodal officers have been appointed for all villages and a cluster officer has been appointed to supervise the working of 20 such nodal officers and the cluster officer is supervised by BDPO or an SDM-level officer.Besides, all the SDMs have already formed WhatsApp groups in their respective sub-divisions so that they can keep a tab on such activities on ground level and cluster officers and other officials are part of these groups, he said.Aggarwal said till date, the district administration has imposed a fine of Rs 2.32 lakh on violators who set the paddy straw on fire.Sanjay Kumar appreciated the efforts of the Ludhiana district administration and urged them to make extra efforts so that the farmers are made aware about the ill effects of burning paddy straw to our environment as well as our health.Sanjay Kumar asked the agriculture and farmers welfare department to ensure that this machinery covers all 928 villages of the district so that maximum number of people can be benefitted from this scheme.He also directed the officials to ensure that paddy crop is purchased, lifted and payments made strictly within the timeframe set by the Punjab government.

The first happy seeder was handed over to Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Samrala. The happy seeder allows sowing of new crops without removing standing rice and deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch.Baranwal also informed that cricketer Harbhajan Singh too has joined CGSTs campaign and has also voiced his concerns against stubble burning.The officials of the department are also conducting a swacchata pakhwara at the CGST Commissionerate and all of them took a pledge to keep the environment clean which was administrated by assistant commissioner V J Saharan.Other activities are also being undertaken by the department under its initiative which included organising a painting competition on the subject of cleanliness at Government Middle School, Civil Lines and donating one RO water purifier system for providing clean drinking water to students and staff. The officers also under took activities of cleaning the school premises and encouraging tree plantation drive."

The department has directed the field officers to conduct the the crop cutting experiments in a proper and effective manner.Mr. Dakshinamoorthy said that steps should be taken to bring more than 80 per cent of the paddy area in the rural areas under the system rice intensification for getting more paddy yield.The Director of Agriculture said that the current year has been declared as Year of Millets. Farmers taking advantage of the various programmes implemented under this scheme, should take steps for increasing the production of millets such as kambu, raagi, cholam, thinai, varaghu saamai etc.Steps should also be taken to bring more area under the maize (makka cholam) crop.The department for achieving more kambu, raagi, and cholam yield was distributing new varieties mini-kits to farmers.He suggested inter-crop and mixed crop in the pulses fields and the same should also be brought into account. The department officials should extend a helping hand to the farmers for achieving higher yield by introducing new crop varieties and adopting latest farm technologies.Mr. Dakshinamoorthy said that the department expected a favourable climate with good monsoon rainfall this season, leading to increased farm production. This is expected to enable the department in achieving the 130 lakh metric tonnes target.The joint directors of agriculture and senior officials participated."

For it has never been as easy to order food  of different kinds  as it is now. You click a few buttons on your phone, and before you know it, someone is at your doorstep, carrying a hamper of the good stuff.It is a win-win situation for new start-ups. There was a time when food delivery was limited to fast food outlets or just a few dishes such as tandoori or butter chicken. If someone wanted to start a food business serving gourmet food, they had to open a restaurant. But renting or buying space in a happening shopping area was truly expensive.Opening up a home delivery outfit, on the other hand, can be a booming business. After all, there is a great demand for good food. People are increasingly seeking to try out something new, and are on the lookout for fresh order-in options.The Biryani Project (TBP), I just learnt, is one such place that has been offering different kinds of biryanis for those who like their rice dish. Earlier this week, they sent two kinds of biryanis over. Since I can only taste a bit, I asked some connoisseurs (essentially foodies!) over. And we had quite a nice feast, indeed.Roasting twelve spicesTBP (phone no: 8750212212) offers various kinds of biryanis  such as Hyderabadi chicken and mutton biryani, Lucknow mutton biryani, Bohra boneless chicken biryani, Andhra Godavari biryani and mixed vegetable Hyderabadi biryani. The people behind the project tell me that they cook dum pukht biryani with the best of ingredients. I got a sampler of Hyderabadi chicken biryani and Godavari chicken biryani. And there was a creamy curd dish to go with it. The chicken biryanis are for Rs. 699 (to serve two), or full handi for Rs. 1099. Vegetable biryani (full) is for 999, the boneless Bohra is for Rs. 1149 and the mutton biryani for Rs. 1199.The friends who had come home like their food spicy, and enjoyed the Godavari biryani hugely. It was certainly a different kind of a rice-and-meat dish, flavoured as it had been with curry leaves and other spices. I am told that 12 spices had been dry roasted and pounded for the biryani, and then pan-fried chicken and had been cooked with baghara rice, and the spices. TBP tells me that what makes this dish special is the combination of spices. If it goes a bit awry, the dish falls apart. Apparently, they had to try it out several times on themselves before they got it just right. I bet they enjoyed themselves!Kashmiri saffronThe Hyderabadi kachche gosht ki biryani was lightly cooked. The meat had been marinated with coriander, mint and green chillies. The dishes, TBP states, are tempered with spices that come from Telangana. And the saffron, it adds, is from Kashmir. The thick curd, spiced with some whole red chillies, went deliciously well with the biryanis.All in all, it was rather nice. And so very convenient. Browse, press a few buttons, open the door  and dig in."

The workshop was being organised by Vanvadi, a forest collective around 15 kms from Neral railway station. After a close to 45-minute auto rickshaw ride, I reach a place far removed from the urban development, yet just a few kilometres away from one of the busiest cities in the world.Back to natureMore than two decades ago a bunch of like-minded people pooled in their resources to buy undulating land in the foothills of the Sahyadris in the north Konkan Western Ghats. Ecological regeneration and local self-reliance was our primary aim, says Bharat Mansata, an active founder-member of the collective. We were initially looking to buy about 10-15 acres for organic farming, mainly of fruit and vegetables. This was to be divided among three-four of us. But with more like-minded people joining, I began dreaming of an alternative community of sorts gradually evolving  a community that aspired to meet its varied needs in harmony with nature and fellow humans, he adds. The venture was tentatively named Vision Acres which was later changed to a more local name, Vanvadi which means forest settlement.Over the past 24 years, the 64-acre land has regenerated into a magnificent forest, dense and rich in biodiversity. A local Adivasi family looks after and works at Vanvadi, almost since its inception. Bua, the eldest member of the family, guides us inside the forest to introduce us to various edible wild greens and plants that grow in abundance during monsoon. He gently navigates his way and points out various vines, plants and trees that either yield seasonally edible parts, or are useful to the Adivasis in some other way.Jewels of the forestDuring the trail we spot suran (loth), a wild variety of yam which has a beautiful ruby red flower sprouting from the ground like mushroom. Its tender leafy growth is also consumed as a vegetable, cooked along with another forest plant bondara. Bua plucks a young leaf off a plant and hands it over to us to chew on, the leaf is bitter with a sour aftertaste. We also munch on tiny variety of awala and aliv, a fruit which looks like chikoo but has a sour aroma when its not fully ripened.Vanvadi, with the help of local Adivasis, has listed over 120 plant species in its forest which are useful to the locals in some way or the other. Out of these about 52 species provide edible yield (leaf, fruit, flower, stem, tuber/root) at a certain time of year. However, early monsoon is the peak season for harvesting many wild greens  the fresh, tender growth of almost a dozen vine species. Certain trees have multiple uses like mahua for instance. While Mahua leaves are converted to fodder, the flowers which are best known for brewing liquor are also cooked in various ways (there are dozens of recipes in Central India that use mahua flower).The mahua fruit can be cooked like a vegetable and its seed is crushed to yield cooking oil. The residual cake after extracting the oil works as manure for the crops. The wood is used to make furniture, musical instruments, agricultural tools etc. However, its sacrosanct to cut a mahua tree; the wood is only used if the tree dies. At present, less than two acres at Vanvadi are being used for farming. Mansata tells us that while the original plan was to plant mainly fruits and vegetables, the Aadivasis showed them that a variety of local millets like nachni, varie, kangu, jowar can also be grown on the gentler slopes. Rice is also farmed on the relatively flat, lower-lying areas.Natural harvestAfter our walk in the woods we come back to the mud cottage, the only house in the midst of the forest, for a lunch cooked by the Adivasi family and Vanvadi volunteers. On the menu there are greens like a wild variety of amaranth, wild colacassia leaves, and ulshya, all stir fried with minimal spices. For accompaniments theres sesame and garlic chutney, koshimbir with mahua flower and dry black chana with dried mahua flower. We polish off the humble meal with nachni bhakri and a local variety of rice.The forest regeneration has also helped the area solve the problem of water scarcity in summer. We get around 8 ft of rain in an average year. With such a generous supply any water scarcity is a human failure, not natures short-coming, shares Mansata. The porous soil of the forest acts as a massive sponge to efficiently recharge the groundwater drawn from wells and bore-wells, while the stream-bed acts as a check and dams helping to harvest rain. The land and its downstream villages now have water all year round, despite a proliferation of one-way extraction bore wells in surrounding areas in recent years.Land rightsVanvadi has had its fair share of struggles and fights too, mainly dealing with the builder community which is deforesting big chunks of land to build resorts and holiday homes. When locals cut the trees for firewood or other use, they dont damage the roots and most trees regenerate. However, the developers dig out the roots with JCBs, which is the major reason for soil erosion under heavy rain, which then silts up stream-bed water bodies, says Mansata.While there are challenges, Vanvadi is also slowly growing as a space to host workshops, work camps, forest food trails and ecology-related educational activities to understand the local flora and fauna, and the vital life-supporting environmental services that the forest provides. In the past, Vanvadi has hosted a nature trail to understand various micro-fauna and reptile species of the region. Every year, the farming community also hosts a Vanutsav or forest festival that celebrates nature and community.Stay updated with the events and workshops at Vanvadi, by joining their Facebook group www.facebook.com/groups/vanvadi"
5ce782d8e8e3fc56af419f55,Punjab’s burning problem,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/punjabs-burning-problem/article25341201.ece,2018-10-27,"The highway to Bibipur, a hamlet about 50 km from Patiala town, cuts through acres of paddy. Some of the rice stalk are still a couple of feet high and green but many fields have taken on the distinctive yellow of straw that is ready to be harvested. About 200 km northwest of Patiala, in Amritsar  from where the monsoon winds recede earlier  the fields have already been harvested and readied for the winter crop. In Patiala, this step is still some time away, as the fires attest. Flaming carpets belch white smoke into the clear blue sky along this stretch of highway.Until October 14, 321 cases of fires were recorded in Amritsar. In contrast, there were only 81 in Patiala, according to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, which tracks such fires via satellites and reports them to the government. Punjab alone generates about 20 million tonnes of straw, three-quarters of which are burnt. Behind the generation of such a huge volume of chaff is the increasing popularity of combine harvesters. Farmers prefer these machines as it helps them save on the high labour costs of manual harvesting. But one advantage of manual harvesting is that the stalk which remains is extremely small and does not impede the sowing of fresh seed. But the machines leave stubble shavings that are 6-8 inches high, which if not cleared make fresh sowing impossible.There are just two things needed for the quickest and the cheapest way to get rid of this stubble: diesel and a match box. Not surprisingly, setting the stubble on fire to prepare the fields for wheat has become a common practice in Punjab. Until a few decades ago, the straw generated by the machines was manageable. They could be sold to the packaging industry and also turned into mulch within the field through the natural, slow process of organic decomposition. Now, however, with about 20 million tonnes of straw generated in the State, and barely two to three weeks to dispose them of and prepare the fields for the next crop, cost-conscious farmers are left with few options other than burning the whole lot.For about a decade now, the Delhi administration has been complaining about this practice, holding it responsible for the abysmal air quality in the capital in winter. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal issued a directive to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh asking them to ban such stubble burning. The environment ministers of these States as well as top officials at the Centre declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble, which has been estimated to contribute anywhere from 7% to 78% of the particulate matter-emission load in Delhi during winter.Since then, farmers in these States, particularly in Punjab, have been at the receiving end of an arsenal of measures which have ranged from persuasion to threats, incentives and entreaties, aimed at dissuading them from the practice.Are machines the answer?In Bibipur, on an early October evening, a group of farmers have gathered at the village council office, a single-storey structure with a corrugated metal roof. In the buildings porch are what the State (and Central) government consider to be the instruments of emancipation: a Happy Seeder machine, a paddy straw chopper and a super straw management system.Broadly, they are a family of hulking, mechanical attachments hitched to tractors. Between them, they can cut the rice straw, chop it finely, and strew it in the field so that over time it decomposes into mulch and becomes organic manure. The Happy Seeder, in particular, allows the rice straw to be cut, new seed (wheat, in the case of Punjab) to be sown, and the residual chaff to be strewn.Seeders and choppers have a long history in India. Inspired by the design and make of similar implements in fields in the U.S. and Australia, they cost Rs. 1-2 lakh a piece.Until 2016, Gurubans Singh, who is Bibipurs biggest farmer with 70 acres of land, was not convinced about the benefits of mechanised harvesting. Singh, who worked as a senior official in the State excise department, returned to farming post-retirement, leasing out portions of his land to tenants. We have been hearing about the harmful effects of stubble burning for some years now. But there were few practical alternatives, he says.This year, Singh says, he was convinced by an environmental engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to try out the machines. Further, there was a new scheme, funded by both the State and Central governments, to defray the expense of buying these machines.Earlier this year, the Union Agriculture Ministry earmarked Rs. 591 crore for disbursal to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the idea being to help farmers access these machines. Individual farmers could buy them at half their retail price; if bought through self-help groups, they got an 80% discount. In Bibipur, Singh and nine other farmers got together and formed such a group. The cost price of the equipment in the Bibipur council office yard is Rs. 10 lakh, but thanks to the government scheme, Singh and his associates bought it for Rs. 2 lakh.According to Hardeep Singh, a local farmer, there are about 800 households in Bibipur, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields that are ripe for harvesting. These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are just three to four machines available [for a variety of tasks such as cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw] for all of us, says Hardeep. That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. But farmers have barely two months  from mid-September to mid-November  to clear out the field. This year, delayed rains have shrunk that window further, and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times in keeping with subtle weather differences. In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, says Hardeep.Given the narrow harvesting window, farmers who require the machines have to line up at the village office to rent them, at Rs. 150 per hour. These machines, now gleaming as they are fresh from the factories, will last about seven to eight years, during which they would lie idle for 11 months in a year. There are servicing costs as well. Sub-optimal machines could backfire and even reduce the yield of the wheat. Servicing and maintenance costs, however, are not included in the government subsidy.Even Singh, who is optimistic that farmers in his village would, like him, whole-heartedly eschew stubble-burning doesnt expect it to happen this year. There also remains to be addressed the matter of inadequacies in the harvesters. For instance, the implements that Bibipur has procured are suitable for large tractors, whereas many farmers here only have smaller ones. This problem is prevalent in other villages too.In Rolu Majra, a village in Rupnagar, Ajaib Singh, 58, who has three acres of paddy, points out that to derive optimum results from the Happy Seeder machine, a tractor with a capacity of 45-55 hp is required. I have a tractor of only 35 hp. Tell me how can I use this machine in my field? The government is pushing these machines without realising that they are not viable for small and marginal farmers, and that they will only increase their straw management costs, he says, adding that given the speed at which the Happy Seeder machine operates, it would take several days to sow wheat as farmers in the village would have to use the machine turn by turn. This would mean that the farmers either have to lease bigger tractors to use these implements or procure customised implements that may cost them more. Just one self-help group in a village is not adequate. What we hope is that by next year (the subsidised-implements scheme is expected to continue) there will be greater supply, Ajaib says.According to government figures, there are around 1.85 million farming families in Punjab, of whom 65% are small and marginal farmers. Of the 5.03 million hectares of land in Punjab, around 4.23 million hectares are under cultivation. Patiala has about 270,000 hectares under cultivation, and in line with the rest of the State, follows a rice-wheat cropping pattern, with rice sown in July and harvested in October-November, while wheat is the winter crop harvested in March-April.A routine practiceAbout 100 km from Bibipur, in Ludhianas Rola village, a paddy field that is barely an acre, is on fire. Upendra, a daily wage labourer from Bihar, is navigating the periphery of the field with a thresher, pushing in stray clumps of straw into the flames to ensure they burn better. He says he is merely following instructions from his paymaster (a farmer whose name he does not know) for Rs. 300 a day.Sarabjit Singh, another farmer from Rola, says that for him, burning the paddy field after harvest is a routine, annual practice. He adds that in his village and for 50 others in the region, no machines have been made available nor have there been any awareness programmes on the harmful effects of burning.State government officials, however, claim that Punjab had disbursed about 8,000 farm implements to individual farmers and set up 4,795 custom hiring centres, from where such machinery could be leased. The cost of hiring these machines, according to Sarabjit, was Rs. 5,000 an acre, and setting the field alight only cost him a few litres of diesel. The per-acre costs also vary depending on the size of the landholding and the cost of fuel on a given day.This narrative, of many farmers being too poor to afford the machinery, is one that State pollution control board officials routinely encounter through the year.Until mid-October, the PPCB had levied Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they have managed to collect only Rs. 3,05,000, according to PPCB figures.The fines are collected over time. Often the farmers do not have the money to immediately pay these fines, says Gulshan Rai, chief environmental engineer, PPCB. Another PPCB official, on condition of anonymity, says that they often do not enforce the fines as these work out to about Rs. 2,500 per acre. Officials say that satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complicated affair. We get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to identify the farmer concerned. Sometimes the farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence, and sometimes poverty, says the officer, who is tasked with following up on stubble burning incidents in Punjab.There is also the danger of violence. The cropping and harvesting seasons are highly stressful times for the farmers who have their hands full coping with uncertainties on the procurement and weather fronts. There have been instances when our officials were gheraoed, or asked why am I being punished, when youve let my neighbour get away, and then there are the farmer unions backed by different political groups. These are complications that we face every year. This year is no different, says another PPCB official.Jaspal Singh, another farmer from Ludhiana, says that rising diesel prices are another factor that farmers bear in mind when choosing between mechanised stubble harvesting and merely burning the field. The machines consume about five litres of diesel per acre. If we grow potato, then about 20 litres. The cost for potato is higher because it is not possible to deploy a Happy Seeder, which is only equipped to thresh rice-straw and sow wheat. In other words, other instruments, such as the mulcher plough, are needed to prepare the field for potato, which would add to the costs.In Punjab and Haryana, there are restrictions in place on how much groundwater could be drawn, as farmers in these States like to flood their fields to sow the rice crop. This, according to Jaspal, has further narrowed the window to a mere two-three weeks for clearing out the rice stubble, forcing farmers like him to burn away the stubble.The government lineBut officials from the PPCB insist that enforcement of the stubble-burning ban has been stepped up, and so far, there have been fewer fires this year when compared to the same time frame last year. From September 21 to October 21 this year, there were 2,589 cases of stubble fire in the State compared to 7,613 such cases during the corresponding period last year.There has also been independent confirmation (though relying on the same satellites) of this decline from Hiren Jethva, a U.S.-based researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-affiliated Universities Space Research Association. Jethvas analysis of crop fires in Punjab and Haryana between October 1 and October 22 suggests that there were 12,194 instances of fires in 2017 and only 5,893 this year. There had been 16,275 of these in 2016.For Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, this is a sign that government intervention is working. We have scaled up several measures this year. Now the crop residue is also being used for seven biomass-based power projects with a combined capacity of 62.5 MW, he said at a recent media briefing. We are educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys the soil nutrients and increases their fertilizer requirement. We have run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier, just Rs. 300 more per acre, than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as their health.Apart from efforts to motivate farmers to sell their field residue to power generation companies, the administration is also trying to build a narrative on how stubble-burning damages the soil.According to Punjabs Additional Chief Secretary (development), Viswajeet Khanna, burning a tonne of paddy straw leads to the soil losing about 5.5 kg of nitrogen, 2.3 kg of phosphorus, 25 kg of potassium, 1.2 kg sulphur, and 400 kg of organic matter, besides causing the death of useful microbial population. Currently, about 4.30 million tonnes of paddy (21.82% of the total paddy straw generated) is being consumed by various stakeholders, as opposed to being burnt in the fields.Pointing out that mechanisation is not the sole answer to the problem of stubble burning, Umendra Dutt of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation promoting organic farming, says that mechanisation is only a partial solution, since most of these machines would be used for just a month and lie idle for the rest of the year. Instead, farmers should be motivated to diversify their crops, focussing on domestic diversification and not just commercial diversification.Yet, even the most optimistic of pollution board authorities, be it in Punjab or Delhi, is not expecting instances of stubble-burning to drop down to zero. In his briefing a fortnight ago, Garg said that 80,879 fire incidents were detected during the season in 2016, and 43,660 in 2017. This year, we expect a 50% reduction, he said. This is roughly in line with the reduction last year. Garg also contends  and this is a widely prevalent view among farmers in Punjab as well as among other PPCB officials  that the pollution from stubble-burning in Punjab contributes minimally to Delhis pollution. We frequently see that air pollution remains low in Punjab but becomes very high in Delhi. Surely, if stubble-burning is a major factor, would not that be reflected here too? he asks.While studies over the years have established that pollutants can travel great distances and survive in the atmosphere for a long time, the contribution of Punjabs stubble-burning to Delhis winter smog has not been precisely determined. A Harvard University study published in March 2018 said that 7-78% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi is due to agricultural fires.Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and an expert on air pollution, says that the relative contribution of crop burning to Delhis pollution episodes is over-emphasised and gives a simplistic explanation for severe pollution episodes. Stubble burning does play a role, but our recent studies show that 60% of Delhis pollution is due to a wide range of sources within Delhi NCR, such as industries, coal burning, and vehicular emissions. Efforts should be made to address them too.Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier than burning the field, and it helps preserve the environment as well as the health of farmers.Krunesh Garg,Member Secretary, Punjab Pollution Control BoardIn many cases there is no option but to burn because it is quick and cheap.Hardeep Singh,Farmer"

(File photo)PATNA: NDA allies Ram Vilas Paswans LJP and Upendra Kushwahas RLSP wasted no time in starting off hectic parleys with Lalu Prasads RJD on Friday, the moment BJP chief Amit Shah and JD(U) president and CM Nitish Kumar announced in Delhi that their parties would contest equal number of Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, which sends 40 MPs to Lok Sabha.Kushwaha met Lalus son Tejashwi Yadav while LJPs parliamentary board chair and Jamui MP, Ram Vilass son Chirag had a 10-minute phone chat with Tejashwi.Though Kushwaha sought to clarify it was a mere chance meeting, an RJD functionary confirmed that Chirag had called Tejashwi. Im unaware what exactly transpired, but it seemed a positive talk minutes after seat-sharing announcement between JD(U) and BJP, the RJD man, who accompanied Tejashwi, said.Chirag, however, claimed LJP would remain in the NDA. Well continue to work together. We hope LJP will get a respectable share of seats to contest, Chirag said in Delhi.LJP has demanded the seven seats it contested in 2014 Lok Sabha election, and is unlikely to settle for a lesser number, LJP Bihar chief Pashupati Kumar Paras said on Tuesday. He also demanded a few seats in UP and Jharkhand.RLSP too has flexed muscles with RJD, repeatedly weighing its kheer option (milk of Yadavs and rice of Kushwahas). As far as 50:50 seat-sharing is concerned, the exact numbers are to be announced. We expect a final decision in the next two-three days, Kushwaha said.Speculation is rife that if RLSP is not given the desired number of seats, Kushwaha will move to the RJD-led grand alliance. We dont have any problem with 50:50 arrangement, but Amit Shah has also said all NDA allies will get respectable share of seats, RLSPs national general secretary and spokesperson Madhaw Anand told TOI."

Police later arrested three persons, the members of a local club.The traders of Natun Bazar near Dum Dum Cantonment at ward no 4 in South Dum Dum municipality on Friday morning launched an agitation to protest against the incident. Fearing attempt on their life, the agitators also put up a road block demanding police protection to run their business in the area.According to a local sources, all the accused are associated with ""Rabindranagar Natunbazar Welfare Society (RNWS)"" that organises kali puja in every year.Chandan Kundu, the owner of a sweetmeat shop said, the youths demanded Rs 40,000 from him. ""I had paid them Rs 2000 as kali puja chanda last year but they demanded Rs 40,000 this time. I pleaded them repeatedly that I couldn't pay it and urged them to take Rs 3000. But they didn't pay any heed to my request and threatened me before leaving my shop. On Friday morning, I rushed to my shop to find its shutter sealed with m-seal plaster that fixed the keyhole,"" Kundu said.Another shop owner, a rice trader Santosh Das said, ""In last year, I was asked to pay Rs 1000 but I managed to pay them Rs 500. But this time they asked me to pay Rs 5000 as puja chanda. When I refused to pay it, they tried to force me to pay. As I turned down their unjustified demand, they sealed my shop with fixing the keyhole on the shutter.""Samir Guha, who runs a fast-food centre at Natun Bazar, alleged that he was threatened with harm as he refused to pay Rs 10000 as puja chanda. ""The door of my shop was also sealed. Though we could reopen the shop with the help of police, but we are afraid of further attack."" Guha said.Police arrested three accused identified as Vivekananda Dey, Tapu Biswas and Manik Das.Sources, however, said, all the accused allegedly owing allegiance to ruling Trinamool Congress are associated with RNWS and Trinamool councillor Gopa Pandey, a CIC(health) member in South Dum Dum municipality is also named in the puja committee banner.Gopa Devi, however, said, ""The law will take its own course. If somebody is found guilty of forcing someone to collect puja chanda in the name of puja committee, we asked police to take stern action against them.""Ananda Roy, DCP, Zone II, Barrackpore commissionerate, however, said, ""After checking CCTV footages we have already identified three accused and arrested them for making nuisance in the area ."""

The initial amount of cash-dole was Rs 5 per head per day for an adult member and Rs 2.50 for a minor.The memorandum pointed out that minor members as of 1997 are still getting amounts allocated to minors even when 16 years have elapsed, and that there has been no bifurcation made in families that have separated after getting married and formed their own separate families.According to the MBIDM, there are presently over 35,000 Bru internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in seven relief camps in Kanchanpur and Panisagar of North Tripura district. So far, approximately 800 families have been repatriated in six phases of repatriation initiatives since November 3, 2010.However, due to allegations of lack of proper implementation of repatriation packages, particularly due to non-fulfilment of demands made by the internally displaced Bru Indigenous refugees in terms of formation of a Bru Autonomous Council, this has been discontinued."

Picture by Manob ChowdharyCongress workers on Friday staged two demonstrations in the capital to protest against deteriorating law and order, Rafale deal and the CBI fiasco.Around 11am, a section of the party workers, under the aegis of Ranchi Mahanagar Congress Committee (RMCC), burnt the effigy of police director general D.K. Pandey near the SSPs office at Kutchery to denounce the worsening law and order situation in the state.A rice trader was shot dead in the city. Serial loots are being committed at petrol pumps. These are glaring examples of a complete collapse in law and order. Congress will not allow this to happen and agitate till each citizen feels safe, RMCC president Sanjay Pandey said.Another demonstration against Rafale deal was organised at Albert Ekka Chowk. Former Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay and other prominent faces of Congress in the city, including Ravindra Singh and Rajesh Thakur, took part in the agitation.It is part of a countrywide protests by Congress against Rafale deal in which Rs 58,000 crore has been spent in the name of purchasing 36 fighter aircraft to benefit Anil Ambani, a close associate of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Through such programmes we are trying to inform common people about the corrupt practices adopted by the BJP government in the Centre, Youth Congress president Kumar Gaurav said.Sahay supported the view.We are also protesting against the way the Prime Minister has put the apex investigating agency of the country in trouble by his action. People in the country are confused after the special director of the CBI Rakesh Asthana was sent on leave and then director Alok Verma was relieved of his post. Ever since Modi came to power, he has put institutions such as the CBI and Election Commission in trouble by his controversial decisions. He now stands exposed, Sahay added."

Picture by Anirban HazraHundreds of farmers in East Burdwans Bhatar and Mangalkote let cows into their paddy fields on Friday to protest lack of irrigation facilities.The agitation to save the kharif (monsoon) crops from drying up left the administration in a fix as it came barely three weeks before harvest.The crop is fast drying up due to lack of rain since September-end. The situation is alarming and water is needed immediately, said an agriculture department official.A 13-day Puja holiday made matters worse as the departments concerned could not arrange for water then. Sources said in East Burdwan said monsoon-dependent paddy on 2.8 lakh hectares of the 3.3 lakh cultivated (84 per cent) was in danger, sources said. Birbhum received 60 per cent less rainfall since September-end and East Burdwan 84 per cent, said a source.A scientist in the agriculture said most rice varieties cultivated in Bengal needed abundant water in the final stages when the grains start maturing.Sources said the water shortage could have been averted had the agriculture and the irrigation departments kept track of the situation and responded accordingly.State agriculture minister Ashish Banerjee met Burdwan officials on Thursday. We have asked the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) to release water from its dams but they do not have enough in their reservoirs because of inadequate rain (upstream) in Jharkhand, said Banerjee.A DVC official contested the ministers assertion. We have shortage but had released water between October 12 and 18, said the official.The release came after the state approached the Central Water Commission on October 10.But nobody followed it up during the (Puja) vacation as the officers could not realise that water released during the seven-day period was not enough, a state official said.Burdwan and Birbhum account for almost 30 per cent of the states kharif output of around 110 lakh tonnes.The crisis could reduce production by 6 lakh tonnes. This is significant as the state produces about 155 lakh tonnes of paddy annually against its requirement of 150 lakh tonnes, said an official."

That certainly seems to be the case. Take, for example, 30-year-old Rahul Mandal, who moved from Calcutta to Loughborough University eight years ago to do a PhD, now works as a research scientist, and has become a national figure because he has a one-in-three chance of winning The Great British Bake Off.This is a hugely popular TV programme which began life on the BBC but was sold for a sack of gold to Channel 4 two years ago and is routinely watched by around six million viewers.Each series begins with 12 amateur contestants, who are asked to bake cakes, tarts, bread and the like and show off their culinary creative abilities. Each week one contestant gets kicked off the show amid usually tearful scenes until three are left for the final.The current judges are Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith, while the programme also has two presenters  broadcaster Sandi Toksvig and comedian Noel Fielding.For the current series, the final takes place on Tuesday (October 30) with Rahul as one of three left standing after 10 weeks of baking. That itself is remarkable because back in Calcutta he did no cooking and  like most Bengali boys  allowed himself to be fed by a doting mother.One of the other finalists is also Indian  Ruby Bhogal, 29, a Punjabi project manager with London Underground, who is one of four siblings who grew up with their mother making jalebis. She is backed by the Daily Mirror because of her gorgeous looks.The third contestant, Kim-Joy, is also not of English ethnicity, which must count as ironic considering tea, cakes, scones with jam and cream are an essential part of English culture.Rahul, whose PhD was in optical metrology, now works in Sheffield Universitys Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, where he specialises in light-based measurement of engineered components.He says he is inspired by an East meets West style of baking and that his instinct is to undertake every bake with a forensic attitude to research and an uncompromising attention to detail. He tries to ensure his creations are beautiful, full of flavour and structurally elegant, too. He is trying to come up with crisps with a flavour of pilau rice or Palak Paneer.Even five years ago he was not even aware of The Great British Bake Off, a programme which provokes deep passions among its viewers. Some think Rahul should have been jettisoned last week but that the judges allowed him to finish his decorations even after time was up.Although he was interested in watching cookery programmes rather than sports as a child in Calcutta. I never baked when I was in India. My baking journey began in the UK about five years ago when I was feeling lonely, and needed to do something along with my studies. At that time, it was limited to making bread and biscuits. The first cake I made was about two years ago, when my parents visited the UK for the first time.It was a friend who pushed him into applying for Bake Off. He was surprised when he was accepted but not as much as his family back in India.Another Bengali, Tamal Ray, who appeared in a previous series in 2015, tweeted: Oh my god, I could watch a whole show about Rahul Skyping his parents!"
5ce78a4de8e3fc56af41a0b9,A home for Mr Khan,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-home-for-mr-khan/cid/1672768,2018-10-27,"A large city has streets full of stories, of all kinds too. Now, some people like to lord over them  the streets  some end up on them tragically, some mingle with the paraphernalia, some guard, some terrorise, and some, like Yusuf Khan, come to turn it into a highway to a different life, a life of their choice and making.Khan came to Calcutta from Baruan, a small village in Jajpur district of Odisha, with a fellow villager. Qayoom was an employee at a leading confectionery shop  there were not many those days  in central Calcutta. It was 1974. Those were harsh days for people living in coastal Odisha. Frequent floods had devastated the farmlands. Poverty was widespread. People had to struggle for a square meal a day.Khan had two brothers, one five years older, the other five years younger. His tall and burly father was in possession of nothing but a small strip of land and that plot was barely cultivable. Grinding poverty and hunger forced Khan to leave for Calcutta. Why him and not one of the other brothers, one cannot say. Those who could throw light are not around any longer. But there he was, all of 13 and raring to venture out. Khans mother reposed a lot of faith in Qayoom, but even so, her heart trembled as she handed over her precious son to his care.Khan arrived in Calcutta with an urgent need to earn money. He started working in a small teashop on Collin Lane, a narrow stretch sandwiched between central Calcuttas Marquis Street and Maulvi Lane. He would serve tea to the shops in the neighbourhood, earning barah annas or 12 annas a day (an anna equals 1/16th of a rupee). And oftentimes, if he was lucky, he earned an anna or two as tip from his customers. Out of his total earnings, he spent four annas on food every day  a little bulky since childhood, he had a big appetite  and the rest was kept aside for home.Khan worked round the clock and at night he slept like a log on the footpath near the teashop, as did the others who worked at the various small shops and eateries of the area. Work and the junoon to keep earning consumed him the next many months. For two years, he did not return home to Odisha.Nothing and no one expressly stopped him, but the boy did not want to go back to the floods, the afternoons so full of hunger, the peech or leftover rice water for dinner, which too the hungry brothers and sisters had to share. Later, of course, he would say there was a pride in working in Calcutta, earning a living and shouldering responsibilities.His mother, however, was upset, distraught even. Whosoever travelled from the village to Calcutta, she would send with him some barley for her son and a plea to return home  for some days at least. After several such requests Khan relented. He returned, not just two years, but a whole childhood later.That year, his elder brother, whose education he had been funding, passed his matriculation examination. Khan felt proud and at the same time regretful for not completing his own education.But living on Calcuttas streets and negotiating his way through its lanes was an education no less. Khan now had an idea of the city and how things worked here. He had a clear distinction between the wrong and the right and the consequences thereof. Tobacco, gutka, paan, he tried them all at some point of time or the other, but they didnt entice him. But yes, he couldnt get over his love for fried beef, from Collin Lanes Teghiya Hotel.Those days, there used to be patrolling vans that would pick up people bathing on the streets and put them in the lockup. Once, bathing at one of those municipality taps, Khan too was picked up. He got out with Shauqats help.Shauqat was a friend and a brother. By now Khan could afford a roof above his head and he and Shauqat shared a single room in a three-storey building in Misri Gali, adjoining Collin Lane. Shauqat was also from a village in Odisha. He was older than Khan by a couple of years and worked as a cook at a local eatery, but eventually landed a job in a company guesthouse close to Camac Street.Days passed and after a couple of years Khan started working for a milk shop nearby. M.N. Pure Milk, as it was called; the owners paid him well at Rs 60 a month. Khan used to measure and serve milk to customers. He also picked up the tricks of the trade  how to make curd, paneer, kalakand, rabri. He would also deliver milk to households on a cycle. It was obvious to the shop owner, Haji Sahab, that this young man was honest, motivated and hardworking. And not just that, Haji Sahab was also impressed with Khans arithmetic skills. He could calculate really fast and in time was made cashier of the shop.In these 15 years away from his village, making a living, Khan had taken on all the financial responsibilities of his family, big and small. His elder brother, who completed his polytechnic degree, bagged a job at Rourkela Steel Plant. The familys days of hardship were clearly over. Khan now shifted focus on his younger brother.For eight years, Khan fulfilled his increasing responsibilities and, perhaps unknown to all, he nurtured a dream. He wanted to open his own milk shop. In 1988, when he told Haji Sahab this with some trepidation, the old man was not surprised. He was a kind man too and promised to help Khan as much as he could.With generous help from Haji Sahab, Khan opened his first shop  Pure Milk Emporium  in south Calcuttas Beckbagan area. With so many years of experience in his kitty, Khan had garnered enough contacts to help him with labour and other small details. He didnt have too much difficulty getting a couple of big clients either and their orders helped him kickstart his business.It was a success. Over a couple of years, Khans shop made a name for itself in the area. Next, he wanted to open another outlet on Shamsul Huda Road, since a lot of the orders were from that area. His reputation and finances grew day by day. And in 2004, he opened a confectionery and snacks shop, after a couple of years of planning.Back in Odisha, in his beloved village in Jajpur, Khan was now a hero to all who knew him and of him. He came to be known as that guy who had made it past all odds and managed to become a bada aadmi, a great big man.Whenever a less fortunate relation or villager approached him for help, Khan did whatever he could. But one thing he could not bring himself to do and that was return to Odisha. He cannot live anywhere else but Calcutta, he tells his family, stolidly, to this date.A moderately religious man, not a day goes by when Khan does not thank the Almighty for the food on his table. He remembers his mother and the pains she took to bring up her children. He remembers and recounts the teachings of Collin Lane.At 57, Yusuf Khan is far from done. He has watched his acquaintances and his elder brother retire, but such a life is not for him. He seems to believe that the day he becomes idle, he will also cease to be."

This means the One who possesses food. Although the Vedic mantra extols the Supreme One through this word, it may specifically be taken as referring to Lord Jagannatha of Puri, said V.S. Karunakarachariar, in a discourse. The prasAda offered in Puri is known as mahAprasAda. The Skanda Purana talks about this mahAprasAda. In other temples, He merely looks at the prasAda, which is then distributed among devotees. But Skanda Purana says that in Puri, the prasAda is tasted by the Lord and then given to devotees. The kitchen in Puri is busy throughout the day, with rice being steamed in mud vessels. The kitchen has a separate well. There is a bhOga maNDapa, for the various food offerings to be spread before the Lord. Every festival is marked by special food offerings. In Orissa, people arrange for prasAda to be made in the temple, and this is what they use in their homes during festivals, instead of preparing these things at home, as people usually do in other places. The cooked rice, after it has been offered to the Lord, is spread out to dry, and this is taken by those who live outside Puri. The mahAprasAda is said to destroy diseases; it ensures that a family is blessed with children; it gets rid of poverty, confers education, long life, and wealth; it is full of auspiciousness. With the sthala purana itself praising the qualities of the mahAprasAda, the Vedic reference of vAjI means Jagannatha of Puri. The word sahamAnah in the mantra can be interpreted as the One who is patient with His devotees. This too can be taken as a reference to His archa avatara as Jagannatha. When Jagannatha approaches His chariot, devotees grab His flowers. But He is patient and enjoys this, because it shows their love for Him."

There should not be a deficit of one single vote. We need to display our might once again to come back to power. Unlike Congress, who only deceived the poor and the farmers, we worked for the development of Chhattisgarh,"" Singh said while addressing a rally from his constituency in Rajnandgaon.Launching a scathing attack at the opposition Congress, Singh said, ""The Congress just took the people for a ride here in Chhattisgarh through their ""Garibi Hatao"" slogan. They did nothing for the poor here. The poor, these days, get rice at Rs 1 per kg, the women get gas cylinders for free. The Congress government here struggled to buy five quintals of rice to feed the people of this state. The farmers of this state badly suffered because of Congress,"" he added.Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath who was also a part of Singh's public rally, said, ""In the last 15 years, the state government through its various schemes have reached out to every single people living in Chhattisgarh. The Chief Minister through his humbleness, hard work, honesty, and his leadership deserves every credit for making Chhattisgarh what it is today. From the deprived, poor, to the Adivasis, everyone in the state has got food security under the Raman Singh government.""The state will go to polls in two phases on November 12 and 20, while the counting of votes will take place on December 11.On Saturday, the BJP announced the names of its candidates for 77 seats out of 90 in the state."

The ex-MP from Janjgir Lok Sabha constituency left the BJP ahead of state elections in 2013 and joined the Congress the following year. In a telephonic interview, Shukla speaks about her poll prospects and how she plans to snatch victory in the high-profile sea.How do you see the status and future of veteran leaders in BJP?There is no worthy place for senior respectable leaders who nurtured and built the BJP. As the BJP after Atalji has changed for what it stood for, my inner conscience didnt allow me to continue further after working for the party for 34 years. To remain with the BJP and to compromise self-esteem has become unendurable. Only those who have vested interests and are willing to live through the humiliation can sustain themselves within the BJP now.Poll in Rajnandgaon is going to be a big challenge as you are pitted against the chief minister who is in the fray for third time.Actually, I am the challenge for the chief minister now. The poll contest against him is not a tough battle for me.Raman Singh talks about development. How do you assess his 15-year performance?Chhattisgarh has witnessed large-scale corruption. He did nothing substantial in Rajnandgaon even after representing the constituency for 10 years. But, he succeeded in getting his son elected to the Lok Sabha from here. There are some 36 Incidents, including the Jhiram Ghati Maoist attack, where no inquiry was carried out.What issues does he face?The state under his government witnessed massive corruption and flourishing commissions such as Rs 36,000 crore rice scam, and state selling liquor for revenue. Thousands of girls are missing. There has been no probe into the biggest ever Naxal attack at Jhiram. The actual needs of Rajnandgaon were ignored. The CM was once forced to exhort his party leaders to refrain themselves from seeking commission.Are you comfortable with the Congress choosing you to fight the election from Rajnandgaon?Indeed, as a committed Congress party worker, I am here to accomplish the mission. The trust and confidence reposed on me by the party cadres and the state leadership has overwhelmed me. Ataljis niece will fight and win as fakir (ascetic) against the resourceful giant.What difference you see between Raman Singhs and PM Modis style of politics in BJP?There is no difference. The day when Atalji left active politics on the health grounds and L K Advaniji, Yashwant Sinhaji were left embarrassed, the changed chal-chehra-charitra of the BJP now stands exposed. Now, Raman Singhji too followed the same path.But, the CM eulogizes Ataljis vision and contribution. BJP leaders have high regards for Vajpayee after his demise.The BJP is politicising Ataljis name merely for electoral advantage. As long as he was hale and hearty, they (the BJP leaders) benefitted from him. When he was ailing, Narendra Modi-Amit Shah took control over the party. BJP used Ataljis name during his lifetime and after his death for gaining political mileage. Its sad when we see some BJP chief ministers and several other ministers giggle and laugh during the tribute paying occasion of Ataljis Kalash Yatra. One can gauge cultural ethos and the moral values of these leaders.Your thoughts about PM Modis rule.The nation is witnessing an undeclared Emergency where the media now has lost its freedom. The disparity over Kathni and Karni (words and actions) within the BJP has much widened after Ataljis exit. It appears that even the liberty to breathe happily has been taken away.How do see the BJP during Vajpayees regime and now?The BJP led by Atalji, Advaniji had inherent practice of democratic values with explicit representative character. Party workers were then heard and given high opinion. Now Modi, Amit Shah is running the party like a private company where core values, ethos and envisioned principles are missing. Apparently, its more of a power politics now."

Reservations are made online.The buses operated in the morning (8 a.m. from Central Bus Stand and 9 a.m. from Srirangam) and night (9.00 p.m. from Central Bus Stand and 10.00 p.m. from Srirangam) have always had full occupancy. Henceforth, there is going to be an upswing in demand, Panchamoorthy, Branch Manager of SETC Tiruchi, said.Mostly, there is repeat patronage from elderly passengers in Srirangam suffering from diabetes. The comfort is a notch higher now. Another advantage is the non-stop service from Srirangam to Koyambedu, according to Senthil Kumar, bus driver.There is provision for passengers using the morning service to place orders for food. Freshly cooked variety rice is supplied by a food contractor at Vikaravandi during lunch time.The bus halts only to receive the ordered food, which the passengers consume while travelling. There is no dearth of Amma water in the bus, the driver added.Two of the 10 SETC classic buses are being operated between Tiruchi and Chennai and one between Dindigul and Chennai via Tiruchi.Passengers do not mind the fact that the buses are non-airconditioned. The provision for air-conditioning was not made to prevent odour.Water to the extent of 150 litre is replenished in a tank in Tiruchi and Koyambedu. Likewise, the sludge stored in another tank is cleaned at the depots, the crew said.The non-stop service is another factor why the buses are well-patronised. It takes a maximum of six-and-a-half hours during the day and less than six hours during night between the two destinations, the driver pointed out."

We can increase our engagement with the US as also China, seeking to occupy the markets which would be vacated in the midst of the ongoing mutual tariff increases by the top two economies, Ravi Sehgal, chairman of EEPC India, said.The focus should be on value addition and increasing the competitiveness of exporters, which can be achieved by fixing some of the procedural issues for tax refunds and customs clearances, he added.EEPC India, representing engineering exports that account for about one-fourth of the countrys total exports, said it would work with the government in identifying opportunities arising out of the new global trade paradigm, marked by the tariff war between the US and China.According to a commerce ministry study, the hike in US tariffs on imports from China has give an opportunity to India to push for higher exports in 180 items  ranging from textiles to marine products  with additional shipment potential of up to $8.7 billion a year.Sources said Indian exporters could look at grabbing a part of the market of about $2-3 billion or more, depending on how quickly and effectively they move.The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling $250 billion worth of goods, including bags, rice and textiles. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion such as chemicals, meat, wheat and wine. The items where India can make inroads into the US market include shrimps and prawns, yarn, fabrics, steel and iron products, leather, rubber and wooden products.Arresting the cost of raw material such as steel will be of importance. Exporters, especially in manufacturing , need to keep their costs in check by getting the raw material at globally competitive prices while logistics support is also important, Sehgal said."

According to him, one should never forget ones mother tongue or motherland. Always speak in Punjabi at your home or whatever is your mother tongue, he said.Just recently, I returned from abroad and I found that even as people there know English but they prefer to speak in their mother tongue. It is very much required. Mother tongue is your eye sight and other languages are like your spectacles. Your eyesight is very important to use glasses also, he said, adding, First learn Punjabi and then Hindi , English.He observed that the heads of other countries who visit India also prefer to converse in their mother tongue. Once I asked our foreign affairs minister Sushma Swaraj if these visiting heads of nations didnt know English, she said that they know but they prefer to speak in their mother tongue. This should be the spirit of India as well. We need to promote our mother tongue, he said. He also advocated that medium of instruction from basic to higher education should also be in mother tongue. Those who wish to study in English, they can opt for that later, he added.He also expressed his concern over the fact that quality private sector education had become out of bounds for the poor and marginalized sections. Why should not private universities earmark certain percentage of seats for students belonging to poorer sections and subsidize their education, he asked.The VP pointed out that public sector alone cannot provide quality higher education and the private sector must pitch in. He said that industries and the private sector in general should supplement the efforts of the government in making quality education available to all. He also called for complete overhaul of the education system, adding that the majority of our colleges have become mere breeding centres for producing students with degree certificates rather than individuals with critical analytical skills. He expressed concern that students passing out of colleges were lacking in employable skills.Launching on the burning issue of the moment  farmers  Naidu lauded the farmers of Punjab for turning the state into rice bowl of India. He insisted that to make agriculture sustainable, innovative methods are necessary. He suggested that students studying agriculture must spend time with farmers to have a firsthand understanding of the problems faced by farmers. India must become self-sufficient to battle the challenges such as hidden hunger and malnutrition, he added.LPU chancellor Ashok Mittal and Punjab minister for industry and commerce Sunder Sham Arora were also present during the occasion."

All chef Mithilesh Tembe had to serve his guru, chef Ranveer Brar, was some finger-licking food.Tembe, executive chef at the 1BHK restaurant in Oshiwara, Mumbai, faced his toughest challenge ever when he had to prepare a meal for Brar, who has taught and honed his culinary skills.Memories, laughter and, of course, food filled 1BHK on Sunday evening as Brar arrived to celebrate International Chefs Day.Tembe started out as an expert in French cuisine, but he began trying his hand at Indian food after being trained by Brar. The food he served Brar, though, was not geographically limited. And it was a spread that would make the guru proud.Charred brocolli with rose harissa, Thai style sweet and sour fish, chickpea hummus with green chilli theecha and poi, prawns chil pil with steam bao, Goan fish curry with red boiled rice and chicken dhansak with brown onion pilaf. For dessert, Brar had creme brulee.Brar was well impressed by his student. The food created by Mithilesh was very expressive. The idea of adding a thecha to the hummus was very interesting, as was serving garlic prawns with poi bread. It was boundary-less and bold food, something that I always stand for, he said.In particular I loved how the Goan fish curry came out, nice consistency. The dish that stood out for me the most was the charred broccoli with rose harissa, he added.Recalling the beautiful evening, Tembe thanked Brar for visiting his restaurant. He said Brar had taught him the mantra of being a chef, which is not just making beautiful food ...its about the humility that you carry it with.Theres one thing, though, Tembe need not be so humble about  the creme brulee he made on Sunday night.

Marinate broccoli for at least 3 hours and allow it to rest in your fridge. While the broccoli is resting, you can get the harrisa ready. Quickly blanch dry red chillies with water and vinegar making them easy to blend. Put all the ingredients in a blending jar and blitz on medium high speed, quickly stirring in intervals. To serve, heat your grill up and char that marinated broccoli until the marination is nicely charred over the broccoli. Pair it with rose harissa and a generous sprinkle of roasted almond flakes."

Please dont give me advice. People are constantly trying to tell me if I am having a boy or a girl. I am told if my stomach is a certain shape, it means its a boy or a girl. And really, I am not interested.This is the third season of your show and you have Angad as a guest. What was it like to interview your husband?Thats a big one for me. It made me nervous. In the previous years, interviewing Karan (Johar) always made me nervous because he is a talk show host but this year, talking to Angad was nerve-wracking. When you are talking to your husband, you dont know where to draw the line and thats exactly what happened when we were recording. We ended up talking for two hours!Youve always talked about Shah Rukh Khan being a dream guest. Would he be on the show this year?Unfortunately not! We were in conversation but hes not doing interviews right now, so I guess next time.Over the three seasons, apart from Karan Johar, whos been your favourite guest and why?Every year theres one guest who surprises me. My biggest surprise this year has been Harbhajan Singh because hes literally done a lot of spin bowling in the comments that he made. And then last year, it was Rishi Kapoor who I was very fascinated with. Apart from Karan, the one guest who cracked me up the most was Farah Khan.You do audio, youre on television, you also act in films  is there a medium that has your heart?This ones very, very close because I am a producer and the host. Donning many different hats makes me feel like I have achieved a lot at the end of one season. But nothing gives me as much satisfaction as making a film. I have Helicopter Eela thats released recently and which I am very excited about.We (Neha and husband Angad Bedi) will be the kind of parents who will take each day as it comes. We dont have a single parenting book or have enrolled for any classes (Agencies)Are you are planning a maternity break after this?Errrr I dont know. I am hoping to keep working until the last day. And then I bring a new life into this world and then get back to work as soon as I can. Again, I dont think there is any such thing as a bad parent; one that gets back to work is just as amazing as the one who stays at home to nurture. I dont know which one of these Id be.Keira Knightley recently wrote an essay about pregnancy and the pressures that society puts on women to look perfect immediately after birth. In the past there has been a lot of scrutiny on Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Kareena Kapoor Khan regarding their post-baby bodiesShame on people who fat-shame new mothers. The most important thing for me is that I am feeling healthy. Will I get disturbed with peoples opinion on my body after I deliver my child? I dont know.There is always pressure on us in the public eye. But I also know that the first couple of months after a woman gives birth, her life is turned upside down. You feel like a wreck and if you look like one, its totally okay. This is the most beautiful time in a mothers life and how you look or dont should be the least of your worries. I hope that I can remind myself this every day. And if I forget, then my mother or husband remind me because their opinion matters the most in my life.Is Bollywoods #MeToo movement a long time coming?Of course. We need to clean up the industry. It makes me very angry that people are questioning the women who are coming forward. At the same time, I am very happy that women are talking. It takes a lot of courage. You cannot turn a blind eye when someone comes forward. When someone shares their story, you have to support them, no matter what. Whether I bring  a daughter or a son  into this world, Id want to teach them these right values."

Nevertheless, it may have a salutory effect of keeping catering contractors on their toes and ensuring they provide good quality food. More than anything else, it would really help if corporators drop by unannounced at these canteens, sample the fare and give their feedback. After all, its not just food but the ambience, staff attitude and overall hygiene which matters a lot in any food place.Download The Times of India News App for Latest CityBENGALURU: The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( BBMP corporators will now be served food prepared at Indira Canteen kitchens during the monthly council meetings at the civic bodys headquarters.While the corporators will have to pay for the food (Rs 5 for breakfast and Rs 10 for lunch/dinner), they will have the luxury of a menu that is slightly different from what is currently available to the public at the canteens. Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun met leaders of the ruling Congress, opposition BJP and ally JD(S) on Monday to discuss the change. Why is it that we cant eat the food thats being served to the public? Earlier too, Padmanabha Reddy of the BJP had raised the same question at the council meeting. I met the party leaders today and they have agreed to this proposition. Currently, we are spending Rs 1 lakh on food bills for every meeting. By switching to Indira Canteen, where corporators will have to pay for the food, we will reduce the financial burden on the civic body , said Gangambike.BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad, however, said a slightly different menu would be served to the corporators as he cant just give them anna-sambar.Apart from the daily menu, we will serve them a few additional items so that the food is similar to what they get now, said Prasad, adding the change will be implemented from this months council meeting on October 29.The BBMP council meets every month to approve resolutions, and discuss important issues that the city is facing. Since these meetings start around 11am and often continue till 4pm, corporators are provided snacks and lunch at the council hall.Indira Canteens regular clientle though can thank the corporators as the regular menu will change for them too on the days the council meetings. Since a few councillors may not be able to eat rice for health reasons, we will also serve a few extra items like a palya and roti. As our council meetings are held only once or twice a month, on the day of the meeting, the extra items that will be served to us, will also be made available to the public at all canteens, said Gangambike."

After conducting more than 100 raids on commercial establishments across Deesa, Gondal and Unjha during the period from June to September, the state GST department learnt that fake invoices citing amounts to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore were generated by the culprits, in a bid to evade paying taxes and still taking the benefit of input tax credit (ITC). ITC benefit worth Rs 58 crore has been illegally claimed by several culprits.Some six persons namely Vimal Bhut, Anil Bhut and Ravikumar Vaja from Gondal; Mehulkumar Thakkar from Deesa and Mayur Thakkar and Amit Thakkar from Unjha, were arrested by the state GST department and produced before the metropolitan court on Monday and were later given judicial custody.Explaining the modus operandi during a press conference on Monday, Ajay Kumar, special commissioner, state commercial tax department, said, To avail ITC benefit, bills for purchase and sales need to be produced. The culprits purchased rice bran oil from states such as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana at a premium and sold them without bill in other states such as Maharashtra and South Gujarat without bill. The purchase bills were later distributed to unregistered dealers who typically sell oil without bills and claim ITC benefit illegally.Offences have been registered against the culprits under section 132(1) of the GST Act, which is a cognizable and non-bailable offence. Several irregularities under the value added tax (VAT) regime have also surfaced against these culprits. In the next stage, we will investigate the traders who have purchased bogus bill to claim ITC benefit illegally and take appropriate action."
5ce7c4c7e8e3fc56af41b2e5,The pilgrimage’s progress,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-pilgrimages-progress/article25282141.ece,2018-10-22,"I remember seeing the birth of Ayyappa on stage during a Kathakali performance. Following the drama of Bhasmasuras destruction by Vishnu as Mohini, Shivas fear turning to gratitude, the two male gods retreated behind the curtain drawn across the stage. The curtain trembled to the clash and roar of cymbals, drums and singing, before being lowered to reveal an image of Ayyappa. We were overawed by the performance and did not think of raising questions about the ways of the gods. I remember too, in the late 1960s, participating in the kettanara rituals (the placing of the bundle of offerings and some items for sustenance on the pilgrims head before he sets off on the pilgrimage) of young cousins departing for Sabarimala on foot. The ritual involved all the women in the household. The young men were unshaven, in black, had donned the mala, and were ready to walk the long route barefoot after having observed their 41-dayvrathams. I was overawed by the faith of the young Ayyappa, the women, and was too young to raise any why nots.Shortcuts and compromisesIn the 1960s, the young Ayyappa would have been among the 15,000 or so who made that arduous journey. No longer. In the past five decades, as the numbers have burgeoned to millions, Lord Ayyappa has been witness to, and extremely tolerant of, every aspect of the pilgrimage being changed beyond recognition. Let us begin with the most important reason being cited for prohibiting women pilgrims of menstruating age: that they cannot maintain the 41-dayvratham. Yet, as we know from personal knowledge, and from detailed anthropological studies of this pilgrimage, the shortcuts and compromises on that earlier observance have been many and Lord Ayyappa himself seems to have taken the changes in his stride.Not all those who reach the foot of the 18 steps that have to be mounted for the darshan of the celibate god observe all aspects of thevratham. A corporate employee, such as one in my family, may observe the restrictions on meat, alcohol and sex, but has given up the compulsion of wearing black or being barefoot. I recall being startled when I saw Ayyappas clad in black enjoying a smoke in the corner of the newspaper office where I once worked; I was told that it was only alcohol that was to be abjured. My surprise was greater when I saw several relatives donning the mala about a week before setting off on the pilgrimage, a serious abbreviation of the 41-day temporary asceticism. Though this has meant no diminution in the faith of those visiting the shrine, clearly the pilgrims progress has been adapted to the temporalities of modern life.Lord Ayyappa has surely observed that the longer pedestrian route to his forest shrine has been shortened by the bus route. From 1,29,000 private vehicles in 2000 to 2,65,000 in 2005, not to mention the countless bus trips, this has resulted in intolerable strains on a fragile ecology. In other words, pilgrim tourism, far from being promoted by womens entry to Sabarimala, had already reached unbearable limits.One of the most vital practices of this pilgrimage enjoins the pilgrim to carry his own consumption basket: nothing should be available for purchase. Provisions for drinking and cleaning water apart, the sacred geography of the shrine was preserved by such restrictions on consumption. But like many large religious corporations such as Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the conveniences of commerce have pervaded every step of the way, with shops selling Ayyapan Bags and other ladies items that can be carried back to the women in the family. In addition to the gilding of the 18 steps, which naturally disallows the quintessential ritual of breaking coconuts, Lord Ayyappa may perhaps have been somewhat amused by the conveyor belt that carries the offerings to be counted. Those devotees who take a return route home via Kovalam to relieve the severities of the temporary celibacy would perhaps be pardoned, even by the Lord, as much as by anthropologists who have noted such interesting accretions. And in 2016, according to theQuarterly Current Affairs, the Modi government announced plans to make Sabarimala an International Pilgrim Centre (as opposed to the State governments request to make it a National Pilgrim Centre) for which funds would never be a problem.The invention of traditionLest this be mistaken for a cynical recounting of the countless ways in which the pilgrimage has been corrupted, let me hasten to say that my point is far simpler. Anyone who studies the social life and history of religion will recognise that practices are constantly adapted and reshaped, as collectivities themselves are changed, adapted and refashioned to suit the constraints of cash, time or even aesthetics. For this, the historians E.J. Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger coined the term the invention of tradition. Who amongst us does not, albeit with a twinge of guilt, agree to the token clipping of the hair at Tirupati in lieu of the full head shave? Who does not feel an unmatched pleasure in the piped water that gently washes the feet as we turn the corner into the main courtyard of Tirupati after hours of waiting in hot and dusty halls? And who does not feel frustrated at the not-so-gentle prod of the wooden stick by the guardian who does not allow you more than a few seconds before the deity at Guruvayur? All these belong properly to the invention of tradition leaving no practice untouched by the conveniences of mass management.But perhaps the most important invention of tradition was the absolute prohibition of women of menstruating age from worship at Sabarimala under rules 3(b) framed under the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965. Personal testimonies have shown that strict prohibition was not, in fact, always observed, but would such a legal specification have been necessary at all if everyone was abiding by that usage or custom from time immemorial? It is a custom with some aberrations as pointed out by Indira Jaisingh, citing the Devaswom Boards earlier admission that women had freely entered the shrine before 1950 for the first rice feeding ceremonies of their children.Elsewhere, the celibate Kumaraswami, in Sandur in Karnataka where women were strictly disallowed, has gracefully conceded space to women worshippers since 1996. The heavens have not fallen, Gandhi remarked in 1934 when a small state in south India [Sandur] has opened the temple to the Harijans. Lord Ayyappa, who has tolerated innumerable changes in the behaviour of his devotees, will surely not allow his wrath to manifest itself. He will be saddened by the hypermobilisation that surrounds the protests today, but would be far more forgiving than the men  and those women  who make, unmake and remake the rules of worship.Janaki Nair teaches history at the Centre for Historical Studies, JNU, New Delhi"

The confusion arises because the object of the villagers reverence is a young girl, who happens to be Mandodaris namesake. The story behind her elevation to divinity is marked with blood, and it goes thus.Young Mandodari lived in the village of Betki in the 16th century, at a time when the locals were trying hard to establish a water management system.It is not that Betki suffered from water paucity, in fact, quite the opposite. The lush agrarian hamlet was blessed with numerous springs that fed the water table and replenished its many waterbodies. Also, located as it was in a valley, it became the recipient of monsoon-fed streams. Rather than let the water go to waste, the villagers decided to harvest this bounty of nature and channelise it to ensure round-the-year water supply for their agricultural and horticultural activities. For this, they decided to dig a huge tank that would serve as a catchment area.Legend has it that, in a bizarre twist, no matter how hard they tried, all attempts by villagers to raise a mud embankment failed. After many tries, the frustrated villagers turned to superstition for relief, and as in the tradition of some dark rituals, it was decided that a blood sacrifice would be offered. Spilling blood to appease evil spirits is part of an ancient and complex tradition followed all over the sub-continent.It so happened that Mandodari and her brother, Narbando, lived near the tank with their widowed mother. And, for reasons unknown, the people of Betki decided to offer the blood of these innocent children in sacrifice.The embankment went up, and Mandodarichem tollem, one of the states biggest man-made lakes, was completed. But, the course of events leading to Mandodari and Narbandos elevation to divine status were yet to play out.In a dramatic turn, the grieving mother, on realising the conspiracy behind her childrens death, placed a curse on the village. No rice will be cooked in Betki for 24 years, she said.What then was the use of having such a huge water reservoir , one that recharged the water table of four villages in its vicinity? The irony of the curse defeated the very purpose behind constructing the lake.Fortunately, around this time, the Fadte Gaonkar community, in a bid to escape religious persecution at the hands of the Portuguese colonial rulers, migrated from Verna in Salcete and settled in Betki.Moved by the conundrum facing the villagers, they decided to help the people of Betki convince the widow to minimise the intensity of her hex. By then, the unfortunate lady had moved residence to a neighbouring village. They tracked her down and prevailed upon her to change the curse. And so, from not growing rice for 24 years, the widow changed the proscription to no rice will be cooked for 24 hours.The relieved villagers on returning to Betki built a shrine in the memory of Mandodari and Narbando near the tank. That was how Mandodari worship came to gain precedence in the village.Writer R B Phadte from Betki, says, In our village, the role played by the sacred tank dedicated to deity Mandodari is immense. There is a saying Shil Savoi, Betki aavai, which mean Betki is the mother of this tank while Savoi is the body.Every year on Mahashivratri, a palanquin procession is brought to the shrine of Mandodari and the goddess is worshipped. Once, this tradition served to create a sentiment of sacredness around the water body, which ensured its up keep.While this traditional water harvesting system survives and continues to be the main source of water for irrigation, the lake has silted and sustained neglect over the years. And the growing apathy towards ecology is sure to lead to its death."
5ce7d2b1e8e3fc56af41b789,Fines fail to deter stubble burning,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fines-fail-to-deter-stubble-burning/article25267643.ece,2018-10-20,"Between September 27 and October 14, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) imposed Rs. 8,92,500 as fines  or environmental compensation cess as it is officially called  on farmers burning paddy stubble. However, they collected only Rs. 3,05,000, according to figures from the organisation.The fines are collected over time  frequently the farmers dont have money to immediately pay them, Gulshan Rai, Chief Environmental Engineer, PPCB, told The Hindu . However our experience from previous years is that this is not a substantial amount.The Centre and the States  Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh  have in several meetings through the year declared a zero tolerance policy on the burning of stubble for farmers, which, according to various studies, contributes anywhere from 17% to 78% to the particulate matter-emission load in the city during winter.To discourage farmers in Punjab and Haryana  who are responsible for the bulk of such fires  the government has also disbursed Rs. 591 crore to these States to sell subsidised farm implements that can do away with stubble without having to burn them.Officials in the PPCB, on the condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that they were frequently lenient when they caught farmers in the act of burning stubble  an offence that invites fines of at least Rs. 2,500 an acre.Officials said satellite images alert them to fields set afire by farmers but actually confronting a guilty farmer is a complex process.We are helplessWe get in touch with the patwari (who keeps land-ownership records) to ascertain the farmer in question. Sometimes, farmers protest, sometimes they plead innocence and sometimes poverty. We are helpless at times, said an officer tasked with following up on stubble burning fires in Punjab.Despite a vigorous focus by governments on making mechanised farm implements  combine harvesters-cum-straw management system, seed drillers, rotary harvesters  available to farmers, its still inaccessible to many farmers with landholdings less than 5 acres or those not rich enough to invest in such machines.In Bibipur village, Patiala, there are about 800 households, according to Hardeep Singh, a resident farmer, and nearly 1,200 acres of paddy fields ripe for harvesting.These machines, at best, can harvest 10 acres a day. There are only three or four machines available (for a variety of tasks from cutting the straw, planting wheat, baling the straw) for all of us, he told The Hindu . That works out to 120 days for managing the fields. However, farmers have barely two months  between mid-September and mid-November  to clear out the field.This year, delayed rains have shrunk the window further and different regions in Punjab have different harvesting times, in keeping with subtle weather differences.In many cases there is no option but to burn because its quick and cheap, Mr. Singh added.Then theres the spike in diesel prices. Deploying the machines uses up nearly 5 litres of diesel per acre (running the tractors, to which these implements are hitched) to sow wheat and nearly 20 litres per acres to farmers who want to grow potato, said Jitender Pal, a farmer in Jaspal Bangar village in Ludhiana.At village Rola, in the Samrala tehsil of Ludhiana, Upendra, a daily-wage labourer from Bihar, was busy setting fire to a 1.5 acre plot of rice straw. It wasnt his land, he said, and was merely following instructions of the malik. The Hindu couldnt contact him. Sarabjit Singh, a farmer in Rola, said no machines were made available to his village. And thats true for 50 villages around, he added.Krunesh Garg, Member Secretary, PPCB, said that change would take some time. Were educating farmers that burning the soil also destroys soil nutrients, and increases their fertilizer requirement. Weve run advertisements. Using farm equipment is only slightly costlier  just Rs. 300 more per acre  than burning the field and helps preserve the environment as well as their health, he said in a media briefing.( The author was part of a media contingent, sponsored by the Union Environment Ministry, to review measures to address stubble burning in Punjab )."

I was afraid of Rasmi at first. I used to hide from her, Noufan said. But the equation changed soon. The horse is now Noufans best buddy. It gets fidgety in his absence and obeys no one else. His father Ummer, a dairy farmer, abandoned his plan to sell the mare when he noticed their friendship. They are friends. Let them enjoy, said Mr. Ummer.Noufan has had his falls and wounds. The scar on his upper forehead shows how hard it was for him to befriend the animal and to learn riding her. He mounts the horse without stirrups and rides her bareback without using a saddle. His sole horse tack is the reins.We are proud of him, said Aleyamma P.J., headmistress of Government High School, Anchachavidi, where Noufan studies in Class 4. After reaching school in the morning, he ties the horse to a tree behind the campus, removes the reins and keeps it in his bag. During lunch break, he gives the mare boiled rice water. His friends cheer loud when he leaves school in the afternoon. I bathe her on alternate days using shampoo. I give her oilcake, horse-gram, grass and rice water, he said.

5ce7d3e4e8e3fc56af41b8a6,A welcome find for farmers,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-welcome-find-for-farmers/article25276982.ece,2018-10-21,"Two new varieties of paddy that require less water and input costs could bail out the scores of farmers in drought-hit Palakkad, known as Keralas traditional rice bowl, the crop developers Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS) say.RARS of Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) at Pattambi has developed the varieties through conventional methods and is promoting the new varieties Supriya and Akshaya.In the launching phase, cultivation of both the varieties was initiated at an eight-acre rice field at Chuttippara, near Elappully, here on Friday.According to farm owner C. Unnikrishnan, Supriya is a tall and late-maturing variety that could be harvested in 140 days. It has been developed by a RARS team led by agricultural scientist K. Karthikeyan. The variety requires less water and will withstand drought conditions. Moreover, it is moderately resistant to pests such as stem borer, leaf folder, whorl maggot and blast.135 daysThe Akshaya variety, developed by a team led by scientist Ilangovan, is also a long-duration variety that is resistant to stem borer, leaf folder, whorl maggot and blast. It also requires less water and is suitable for both rain-fed and irrigated paddy fields. It could be harvested in 135 days.According to RARS officials, the rice varieties are ideal for water-starved areas of Palakkad and Chittur taluks where farmers struggle due to lack of sufficient water resources.The net crop area in Palakkad district has shrunk drastically in the last 10 years due to droughts and climate variations. Paddy is considered the most water-intensive crop.As water resources dry up, farmers in the district suffer huge losses. The use of paddy varieties requiring less irrigation hence will be a big relief for farmers in the region.The new varieties can give a yield of eight tonnes of rice per hectare. These are tasty white rices, says Mr Unnikrishnan.The cultivation is being done under the supervision of RARS coordinator Israel Thomas."

Sal flowers are brought to the saran sthal or sacred place where the pahan or priest offers prayers to the gods and distributes the flowers. It is believed that the flowers represent the brotherhood among villagers and the earth becomes fertile after this festival. Around this time, the Santhals  who constitute the largest tribal community in Jharkhand  celebrate Baha, the festival of flowers. Besides sal, mahua flowers are used in the rituals. The Santhals and Oraons of Bihar, Odisha, Bengal and Chhattisgarh also celebrate colourful Sohrai. Come October, they coat the outer walls of their houses with a layer of white mud and while it is still wet, they draw flowers, fruits, leaves and other motifs inspired by their habitat.Santhals of Jharkhand celebrating Baha, the festival of flowers File ImageJudi Sital and Sama-ChakevaThe Maithils of Bihar celebrate the arrival of summer and their new year on April 14. They call the occasion Judi Sital. On this day, they eat badi-bhaat (made of gram flour) prepared the day before and donate earthen pitchers containing water to Maithil Brahmins. The other festival of the Maithils is Sama-Chakeva, which is usually celebrated when winter commences and birds migrate from the Himalayas to the plains. Maithil women make idols of a pair of birds named Sama and Chakeva and decorate them in the traditional way. The day-long celebration ends with a vidaai or goodbye to these birds and an earnest prayer that they return the following year.Vautha MelaThe Pushkar Mela of Rajasthan is well known but have you heard of Gujarats Vautha Mela? Hundreds of camels and thousands of donkeys are adorned with ornaments and paint and brought to this fair to be sold. The mela or fair that happens around November every year is considered more important than Diwali celebrations as it takes place at the confluence of seven holy rivers  Vatrak, Meshwo, Hathmati, Shedhi, Majum, Khari and Sabarmati. Diyas are set afloat in the water in the evening. A popular snack associated with this festival is the khichu, which is made of rice, cumin seeds, green chillies and soda bi-carb.TheyyamThis 800-year-old dance festival is typical to north Malabar. People of Karivellur, Kurumathur, Nileshwar, Ezhom and Cherukunnu in Kerala celebrate it every year between December and April. The most intriguing and interesting bit about this festival is the reversal of caste positions it necessitates. The performers belong to lower castes. They paint their faces yellow and red, dress up in flamboyant costumes and headgear. This is perhaps the only time of the year when the upper castes fall at their feet and worship them as gods. In his book, Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India, William Dalrymple writes about Dalit Hari Das, who slips into a deity-like avatar once a year  taking a break from his day job in a jail.Theyyam necessitates the reversal of caste positions AFP/GettyGonchaThis festival is named after a fruit and is celebrated by the Bhatra and Halba tribes of Bastar in Chhattisgarh. Much like Odishas Rath Yatra  it also takes place in July  there are three chariots carrying the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra and a procession of devotees follow them.

It commemorates the valour of a mother and daughter, Sammakka and Saralamma. Tribal lore has it that some time in the 13th century, tribal leaders went hunting in the forest and found a newborn playing amidst tigers. This was Sammakka. She was adopted by the head of the tribe and brought up to be chief after him. She later became the saviour of the tribals of the region and is considered a goddess by them.

All the festive rituals are conducted by priests of the Koya tribe.HareliThis festival derives its name from the Hindi word hariyali, meaning greenery, and is one of the most prominent performing arts festivals of the Durg district of Chhattisgarh. At the core of all performances lies a veneration of all that is crucial to the farmer  his cattle, his ploughing equipment and so on.KaragaIt is a folk dance festival performed to celebrate the advent of spring by Thigalas, a community of gardeners and lake settlers in Bangalore, Mysore and Madikeri areas of Karnataka. It is seen as a tribute to Draupadi, the Pandava queen. Legend has it that at some point, Draupadi took the form of goddess Shakti and created soldiers called the veerkumaras to deal with a demon named Tripurasura. When it was time for Draupadi to go to heaven, the veerkumaras wanted her to stay back. She couldnt keep their request but promised to visit her devotees on the first full moon day of the lunar new year. Her visit marks the nine-day festival in which the priest, dressed as a woman, covered in flowers, carries the Karaga (the three-feet tall water pot symbolising Draupadi) on his head and walks to the homes of the veerkumaras so that they can worship the Karaga. The dancers perform various acrobatic feats  while following the procession  to the accompaniment of musical instruments like the thavi, nadaswaram, muni, udukka and pamba. At the end of the festival, the Karaga returns to the temple.In other words, all time is festival time in this country of ours.DreeAlthough Dree is the festival of the Apatani tribe, it has gained popularity amongst other tribes in Arunachal Pradesh.

During this five-day festival, they worship local deities Sanamahi, Nongpok Ningthou, Leimarel, Pakhangba and 364 umang lais or jungle deities. Both men and women dance and enact the Khamba-Thoibi, a popular Manipuri folktale. The festival ends with performances such as Ougri Hangen or the song about controlling the mind; Khencho, which is about the concept of the third birth; and Hijan Hirao, the song sung during the felling of trees to craft two big boats  one for the male deity, the other for the female. Sports such as indigenous polo and wrestling mark the conclusion of the festival.In the hills, the Kukis, Chins and Mizos celebrate the colourful Chavang Kut. Dressed in colourfully woven half-sleeve jackets and sarongs, the cultural troupes of the Kuki tribe gather at the picturesque Peace Ground at Tuibong in Churachandpur, Manipur. The traditional Kuki symbol of the skull dominates the festival  celebrated in the latter half of October  after the villagers complete their back-breaking toil in the fields.The Bodos of Assam celebrate Bwisagu, a festival of Shiva or Baithou, in April, around the same time as the rest of Assam celebrates Bihu. One of the major attractions of the festival is the Bagarumba dance. Women dress up in the traditional dokhana or draped skirt and the jwmgra or shawl. With outstretched arms and the shawl around their shoulders, they look like colourful birds fluttering wings. The men play instruments such as the serja (it resembles a violin), tifung (something like a flute), tharkha (a piece of split bamboo) and khum (a long drum)."
