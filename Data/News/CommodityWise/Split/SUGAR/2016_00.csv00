Singh, was addressing farmers at a protest meeting outside divisional commissioner's office in the city.""One sugarmill in Baghpat's Malakpur owes farmers Rs 239 crore and another one in Modinagar still has to pay Rs 103 crore. There is limit to one's patience. How long can farmers wait under these circumstances?"" he said.The state government has already cleared 95% of the pending sugarcane dues , but has been criticized by the opposition parties as Rs 1,000 dues still remains pending with some erring mills in Meerut range.Secretary, Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mill Association (UPSMA), Deepak Guptara, said, ""We have been able to clear more than 95% of the dues as far as privately-held mills are concerned but the alleged erring mill in Malakpur is not even our member so we cannot comment on its defaulter status.""Singh further stated, ""According to Sugar Control Order 1966, a sugar mill is supposed to pay cane grower within 14 days of the receipt of his crop and in case of delay, it should compensate with 15% interest. But here, even the original payment is pending since ages.

Despite the government support, however, cane dues of Rs 1,318 crore (of about Rs 24,000 crore annually) remain unpaid in UP.Welcoming the move and describing it as the government's attempt to pass on to farmers the benefits of stronger sugar prices in the international market, state planning commission member Sudhir Panwar said, ""This is the first time in three years that sugarcane farmers are benefiting in this way. I had raised the issue of one-time settlement of cane dues during the Sugarcane Price Fixation Committee meetings, and I am happy to see the suggestion has been taken up and ratified.""On Friday, the cabinet fixed Rs 315 per quintal as SAP for early variety crop, Rs 305 per quintal for normal crop, and Rs 300 for the sub-standard cane.

One of them was sighted near Puranpur Cooperative Sugar Mill , around 4 km from Haripur range of PTR, and another was seen in Selha Bengali Colony . adjacent to Barahi forest range.A farmer of Mala Bengali Colony was mauled by a tiger on Sunday evening when he entered Mala forest division of PTR for defecation.

For, horse-trading is rampant in this election in which elected members of local-self-government are voters. Bhandara-Gondia and Yavatmal are the two seats in Vidarbha.The candidates were busy on Friday wooing voters using all means. Talk of horse-trading and currency muddle was rife. Politicians joked of voters returning the old currency handed over before November 8 and demanding new notes or gold coins to seal the deals. Naturally, each party blamed the other for indulging in such nefarious tactics.In Bhandara-Gondia, it's a triangular, tough fight but in Yavatmal the battle is virtually straight between the Congress and the Shiv Sena.NCP stalwart Praful Patel's prestige is at stake as his close confidant and sitting MLC Rajendra Jain is re-contesting on NCP ticket from the Bhandara-Gondia seat. BJP candidate Parinay Fuke is seen as 'CM's choice,' making it a proxy battle between CM Devendra Fadnavis and Patel. Complicating the fight is Congress candidate, Praful Agarwal, who is in the fray as Patel refused to yield seat to the Congress thus aborting the NCP-Congress seat sharing pact.With all three candidates likely to draw equal votes, the parties are now trying to garner second preference votes to get past the winning mark.""I don't think Jain will have problem retaining the seat. The NCP has enough votes to get elected,"" Patel told TOI on phone from Delhi where he is busy with Parliament session and has no plans to be on home turf of Gondia on election day. The 393 voters of the constituency include members of zilla parishad, municipal councils, nagar panchayats and sabhapatis of panchayat samitis of Bhandara and Gondia districts. The party wise strength is BJP-119, Congress-102, NCP-123, Shiv Sena-25, Independents-25 and CPI-1 giving a clear edge to Fuke.For the BJP, local MP Nana Patole is leading the campaign and is confident that Fuke will win comfortably as the Sena-BJP with 'friendly' independents make up the largest chunk of over 150 votes. Fuke is hopeful that he will get through on strength of the second preference votes. Though an outsider, Fuke is using his proximity with power in the state to his advantage to influence voters.The Congress is in no mood to give up. It has deployed master-strategist Satish Chaturvedi at the last minute as observer. Praful is son of local Congress veteran Gopal Agarwal who has won the seat twice in the past. Chaturvedi, along with Nitin Raut (who is in-charge of the campaign), MLA Sunil Kedar, Anant Gharad will be camping in the constituency on Friday. ""Though we are short of numbers on our own, we have garnered enough support and the result will be a big surprise,"" said Chaturvedi.Meanwhile, in Yavatmal seat NCP sitting MLC Sandeep Bajoriya's withdrawal from the fray has made it a straight fight between Congress' Shankar Bade and Shiv-Sena's imported' candidate Tanaji Sawant. A sugar baron who also runs 78 educational institutions in western Maharashtra, Sawant is said to be close to Sena chief Uddhav Thaceray who wants him to win at any 'cost.'Congress stalwart Shivajirao Moghe spearheading Bade's is confident that Sawant's money-power would not work. ""Not the Gandhi on the currency notes, but the true Gandhian ideals that the Congress professes will triumph,"" said Moghe. Of the 440 votes Congress has 156, NCP 91, Sena 71 and the BJP 54. With NCP votes now a free float could be a big help for Sawant. But he is an outsider while Bade with vast experience as municipal chief of Pandharkawda could get vote on merit."

It will choke black money,"" he said.Prime Minister Modi today also attacked the Samajwadi Party government in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh for being ""unconcerned"" about the hardships faced by people, and asked if its family feud was over - so that it could concentrate on implementing central schemes for farmers.He criticised the Akhilesh Yadav government for not implementing the schemes to benefit farmers though the Centre was paying for them.""I want to ask UP government if you have settled your dispute, implement crop insurance scheme in UP. I don't think they (UP government) can do that... They don't have interest in solving problems,"" he said.He was apparently referring to the crisis within the Yadav family that pitted Akhilesh against his father Mulayam and uncle Shivpal months ahead of the UP elections.Modi said that if previous governments thought of changing lives in villages, farmers and the poor wouldn't have been facing problems.""The time has gone when those in government called themselves rulers. I am your 'sewak' (I'm at your service)... It's my responsibility to work for you. You have given me a lot.

When we formed government at the Centre, we decided to take care of cane growers. Now only very little payment is pending,"" he said.Highlighting his government's initiatives, Modi said sugarcane farmer's dues were transferred to their accounts directly, to ensure there were no middlemen.He added that he'd also asked sugar mills to install machinery to produce ethanol, which could be used as an alternative to petrol and diesel.""If sugar prices fall, produce ethanol.

Besides, there are certain commodities like sugar and wheat which are witnessing firming of prices, the paper pointed out.""Thus, however much we in the industry might like to see lowering of interest rates , the macro picture may make it a difficult proposition,"" Assocham said.The analysis by the industry body Assocham noted that the biggest risks are emanating from the unfolding global scenario, marking sharp strengthening of the US dollar, raking in international money back into the American economy. Moreover, it said, most of the emerging markets have witnessed huge outflows, exerting pressure on their currencies.""We are slowly moving away from a highly beneficial position of low crude oil prices and a stable as well as strong rupee which made the landed cost of energy quite cheap.""Now, we are getting into the reverse position where crude oil is firming up and rupee is becoming weaker. Thus, it would be a double whammy of increased import bill in dollar terms and on top of it, higher landing cost on account of weaker rupee,"" Assocham President Sunil Kanoria said.India is amongst the largest crude oil importers in the world and net importing country. So, the dollar strengthening has a direct and immediate impact on the country's overall balance of payment position and would lead to inflation in the medium term, the analysis revealed.According to the paper, while weaker rupee is good news for the Indian exporters, they would face greater competition from the peers like China, Vietnam, the Philippines and Bangladesh.The Chinese currency is melting against dollar, helping its exporters in the process. Thanks to weakening of the Renminbi, Japan has overtaken China as the largest holder of the US treasuries, the report said.Among the domestic challenges, the play-out of the demonetisation remains to be seen in terms of impact on the Gross Domestic Product while uncertainty over implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has increased, it said."

However, their margins expanded on benign input costs.This July-September quarter, sales growth for companies was lowest in almost a decade. Hindustan Unilevers revenue in the second quarter rose just 2%.While, the companies were hoping for a recovery in the second half of this year, the demonetisation has reduced demand further, particularly in wholesale channels, which drive almost 40% of FMCG business. The cost of raw materials has also inched up following a rise in global crude prices.According to Nielsen, consumer sales declined 1.8% in November versus October, while retailer purchase from trade fell 6.4%. The overall FMCG industry is estimated to be worth 2.56 lakh crore, so in absolute terms, the drop was huge, it said.Despite Diwali-related spends, there is an indication of lost velocity in FMCG. More importantly, we see retailer purchases declining faster than consumer sales, Nielsen said.Impulse foods and personal care products are among the most affected in terms of consumer offtake.The consumer is clearly moving into more daily necessities. ...The fact is that the consumer has got limited cash outlays ... said P Balaji, CFO, Hindustan Unilever, the largest FMCG player in the country.He also said the wholesale sector was among the most affected and so the company would focus on increasing its direct coverage of retail outlets.Religare Securities has cut its sales estimates on companies across the FMCG sector by 1.1%-7.5% for the current financial year, while profit estimates have been slashed by 3.2%-18.6%.Over the last few months, the price of key raw materials is on the rise.For instance, palm oil (key input in soaps) is up 48% year-on-year, wheat 24%, rice bran 16% and sugar 31%."

For example, a popular health drink claims it contains ""pro health vitamins"", but the label suggests that it has 71gms of sugar for every 100 grams. This sugar content is actually 57% of the recommended daily intake limit.A new study by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) released on Friday reveals how several popular brands of snacks , health drinks, cooking oil and noodles don't tell you what you must know. A brand of health drink that claims it has ""34 vital nutrients, 100% milk protein, more protein faster growth"" actually contains sugar as high as 38% of recommended daily upper limit per serving.""In fact, we have not accounted for the fact that a person may consume it more than once and add sugar to the drink,"" said Amit Khurana of the food safety and toxins programme at CSE. Equally misleading are the advertisements  a brand of digestive biscuits, which claims to have less refined flour (maida) was, in fact, found to contain more maida than whole wheat, according to Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI). More such complaints sourced by CSE suggest several brands make claims in advertisements that have no substance.A oil brand that claims to contain ""antioxidant powder"" and suggests it is the ""healthiest choice for your heart"" allegedly violated the norms laid down by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Moreover, ASCI is a ""self-regulatory"" body, which does not have the power to impose punitive measures due to which violators may repeat the same offences.According to the report, the labelling requirements in India are extremely lax. The Food Safety Regulations, 2011 make it mandatory for the brands to declare energy, protein, carbohydrate and fat content. The quantity of sugar is to be specified as well.""A product may be fat free, but it may be very high on sugar. Consumers don't tend to notice that aspect of the ingredients on the labels,"" said Ishi Khosla, nutritionist, who was present at the release of the report. CSE researchers have recommended a complete ban on celebrity endorsement of food that is high in salt, sugar and fats. Sunita Narain , director general, CSE, said: ""The government is considering amending the Consumer Protection Act to provide for a five-year jail terms or a penalty of Rs 50 lakh to hold celebrities responsible for false and misleading claims. But the same amendment says that there will be no liability if precautions are taken before deciding to endorse a product. In other words, this amendment amounts to nothing.""Readers can find the brand names in a report published on the CSE website."

The exclusive winter delicacy could also leave an unsavoury taste in your mouth.Instead of the usual juicy sorghum seeds, several unscrupulous elements are passing off artificially coloured and sweetened varieties in several places of Surat. Served with tri-coloured sev, pepper and chilli powder, it is difficult for commoners to make out that they are not savouring the real ponk.TOI has learnt that these sellers are making quick buck, quite prominently in vegetable markets of Bhagal and Adajan as well as Pandesara. But it is difficult to catch hold of them as they keep changing places along with their cane baskets, sources said.""I was surprised to discover that the fresh green ponk I got for Rs 500 per kg turned out to be chewy and utterly tasteless. But what was more shocking was that it left my tongue green coloured,"" said Reeta Bharucha , a resident of Mahidharpura, who had purchased ponk from Bhagal.""When I went back to return the ponk, the woman with the huge cane basked was nowhere to be seen,"" Bharucha said, adding that a shopkeeper later revealed how she was conned into buying the fake variety.Anyways, Surat's ponk is fast losing its taste to the produce from Bardoli due to increasing pollution and loss of cultivation areas that have been converted into concrete jungles. The ponk is Surat is relatively dry while that in Bardoli has a more spongy texture with smoky umami flavour.These sellers lightly steam small-sized jowar seeds, dip them in green-coloured liquid and coat them with dense sugar syrup before drying it out to ensure that the grains separate out.Antique dealer Pankaj Parekh in Wadifalia had a similar experience recently. ""Eager to taste the first ponk of the season, I purchased 750 grams from a roadside vendor at Bhagal. Although I tasted it first and the sample was small-sized seeds that were milky just as it should be, on opening the packet at home, the ponk was bright green, hard and very chewy. It it also smelt a bit off.""Sanat Relia, vice president of The South Gujarat Hotel and Restaurant Association , said, ""Such artificial colour is cancer causing and could also result in intestinal damage.""When approached, Jagdish Salunke, Surat Municipal Corporation 's (SMC) food inspector incharge, said, ""This fact had not been brought to the notice of the SMC before.

The move is being pushed by the strong ethanol producers' lobby in the state, which will benefit the most from producing more ethanol to meet the increased target.TOI had earlier highlighted the issue of ethanol in petrol getting converted into water, and even the Vidarbha Petroleum Dealers Association (VPDA) had taken it up with the district administration after their complaints were ignored by the public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).MP and union minister Nitin Gadkari had then spoken of centre's plan to take the blending proportion up to 22.5% in the near future.The data available with VPDA shows that total ethanol blending percentage in petrol across the nation is less than 3%, even though the mandatory norm is 10%. This is attributed to the less availability of ethanol.""Around 10% ethanol is being blended in petrol throughout the state. Uttar Pradesh leads in sugar cane production. But Maharashtra leads in ethanol production. There are 61 ethanol producing units in the state and only 34 in UP. Some 96.37 crore litres of ethanol is produced in the state while the figure is 91.85 crore litres in UP. The ethanol producers, who had earlier pushed for raising blending percentage from 5 to 10%, are now pressing for increase up to 22.50%,"" VPDA office bearers told TOI.Selling ethanol to OMCs is very profitable since they are bound to purchase it at Rs 49.50/litre against a production cost of Rs 36.20/litre. Ethanol producers do not sell their production to chemical industries, which are clamouring for supply, because they pay a lower rate.In a question hour reply in Lok Sabha during the March budget session, OMC ethanol procurement was said to be 39.81 crore litres per year in the state. This is far less than the production in the state, which is 96.37 crore litres. Even if the blending percentage is increased to 22.50%, the requirement will rise to around 48.76 crore litres, which can be easily met from the state's production.Petroleum dealers, however, see this as a setback. The ethanol in petrol in underground tanks at petrol pumps is bound to convert into water due to various reasons, which will result in higher financial loss for dealers and consumers alike, they say.""After the blending percentage was upped from 5% to 10%, we received several complaints from consumers. As such, 22.50% blending of ethanol during rains can pose a major problem,"" said a dealer on condition of anonymity.VPDA has taken up the issue with the OMCs, and a meeting is scheduled on this issue in December-end."

The coin-sized savoury that closely resembles the puri expect for that it is crisp and crunchy, is now not prepared as much and, if at all, is more local to the villages. ""We used to have voddes as part of the Christmas lunch when we were growing up in Panaji,"" says historian Maria Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, though she adds that even then, the voddes were more popular in rural Goa.There was a reason for this. voddes are prepared from local rice which has not undergone the par-boiling process.""Those who grew paddy would keep a certain quantity of un-husked rice aside, especially to prepare vodde,"" Costa says. This would then be de-husked and made into flour. Back in time, the dantem was used to grind the rice. The coarse flour went into making vodde, while the finer quality was used for dodol, another Christmas dish, but one that continues to remain popular.The preparation is much akin to that of puris only that these are much smaller and they are deep fried till crispy. ""The hardness varies depending on when you plan to serve them,"" says Costa. If you are partaking of it at lunch, then they are slightly softer like puris and a tad bit bigger than the harder variety. But, if evening tea is in mind, then voddes are usually hard. The taste of the savoury is such that it complements almost everything from stew to black tea, thus, making it a versatile accompaniment.""But, some even choose to make it sweet by adding a little sugar or jaggarey,"" say ex-teacher, E Costa of Colva, who shares that sweets such as bebinca were once the closely guarded secrets of the elite and so the lesser privileged made do with items like sweet vodde and mandare.The type of vodde prepared - soft or hard - also depends on the kneading and flattening process, as also the flour used  wheat or rice. ""Some also prepare voddes from wheat flour,"" says the historian and explains that earlier, not everyone had access to that particular rice. ""People who prepared the flour would send over some to their friends and neigbours,"" she says, and adds that if flour was not sent, then at least the voddes would be.The crispy treats are also an intrinsic part of the bhikareanchem jevonn.(Reported by"

Some have made the Solapur railway station their exchange point to escape police scrutiny.""We heard that by scrapping the old notes, the government is checking how much money people like us have. Why should we disclose our money to the government? Do they want to cancel subsidies and the schemes for the poor?"" bidi roller Ganga Langdewale said.M H Sheikh, leader of the workers' union in Solapur, said the government issues new orders every day which is confusing. ""There is much rumour mongering which the poor are succumbing to. Moneylenders in Solapur are making big business out of currency exchange,"" he said, while alleging that they were hand-in-glove with the administration and bankers who are helping them dispose of the old notes.Outside the gates of Shri Siddheshwar sugar mill, two money lenders with leather bags hang around near the makeshift huts of cane cutters. They refuse to speak to 'outsiders' and when asked what work they have with cane cutters, they scrammed.Cane cutter Radhabai Mulik, who has migrated from Beed, claimed she is unaware of what is happening. ""I am not sure what this scrapping of currency is. We don't have money at all to exchange,"" she said.She said the men in her family had warned her not to talk about money exchange with anyone. But she admits that the poor are being swindled in the post-demonetisation process.Solapur shares its border with Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and attracts a large migrant population. With the highest number of sugar factories in the state, Solapur is important for cotton textile manufacturing, bidi factories, dal and oil mills and dye industry. The huge population of labourers has spawned generations of money lenders.""Half the city's economy revolves around money lenders as workers are always in need of money. Demonetisation has come as a gift to money lenders as workers prefer them over bankers. Just as the people are queuing up outside banks, workers are lining up in front of money lenders who change their locations frequently to lend money,"" local youth Arvind Shinde said.Demonetisation in this marriage season has made people desperate for new currency. ""We have a marriage in our family. We have saved some money and want to borrow from others. What do we do with the old currency notes?,"" Laxmi Kaki said. She planned to visit the money lender."

General secretary of AP Tenant Farmers' Welfare Association, M Balaram said, ""The demonetisation drive has hampered agriculture activity across the state. Farmers use hard cash to buy seeds, fertiliser, farm equipment and other agricultural products apart from paying the labourers and traders. The commission agents too pay the farmers in cash.""""Now, everyone is refusing to accept payments in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,"" he added.However, speaking to TOI, district joint director for department of agriculture, V Satyanarayana pointed out that the government outlets selling seeds and fertiliser were accepting the old notes. ""However, the district administration including collector Pravin Kumar is eager to shift to the usage of Point-Of-Sale machines even for trading agriculture goods,"" the officer said.Another agriculture officer pointed out that while the government outlets were accepting the banned currency notes, the private ones were refusing to do so.""The government has introduced Rs 2,000 currency note, but it is of no use for us. The land owners are paying the labourers in Rs 2,000, Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes. To get change for these big amounts is a problem as there is a severe shortage of smaller denominations. The government is not looking into our problems,"" said P Sanyasi Rao, leader of an agriculture labourers association in Srikakulam.North coastal AP has nearly 10 lakh farmers raising all kind of crops like paddy, sugar cane, cotton, ground nut and maize, while nearly 5 lakh agriculture labourers eke out a living in the three districts."

High blood sugar occurs either due to low production of insulin in the body or lack of response from blood cells to the insulin produced.Diabetes is a multi-factorial lifestyle disorder of increasing sugar level in the blood which gets aggravated due to lack of proper exercise, faulty dietary habits and stress. Along with medical treatment, yoga , meditation and good lifestyle practices such as daily brisk walk can be of invaluable help in the management of diabetes and prevention of complications.Regular yoga practice can help reduce the level of sugar in the blood, lower blood pressure, keep a check on weight, reduce stress and hypertension and reduce the symptoms as well as slow down the rate of progress of diabetes. It also lowers the severity of further diabetic complications.The yoga practices that one can follow should be regular and consistent and one should stick to a daily fixed schedule either in the mornings or evenings.""Stress is one of the major reasons for diabetes, as it is in most lifestyle diseases. It increases the secretion of glucagon hormones in the body resulting in increased blood glucose levels. Consistent practice of yoga asanas (body postures), pranayamas (breathing exercises) and a few minutes of daily meditation can help reduce both physical as well as mental stress. This, in turn, reduces the glucagon hormones and can help improve insulin action. The practice of yoga is also proven to reduce weight as well as control the tendency to gain weight, two factors particularly important to keep diabetes in check. Surya Namaskar and Kapal Bhati Pranayama are two of the best ways to reduce excess weight,"" said Savita Mahanti of The Art of Living.The yoga exponent also suggested a few yoga asanas to tackle diabetes better. These include Kapal Bhati Pranayama or a special breathing technique that helps energise the nervous system and rejuvenates the brain cells. It's helpful for patients suffering from diabetes as it stimulates the abdominal organs. This pranayama also improves blood circulation and helps de-stress the mind.Secondly, Supta Matsyendrasana massages the internal organs and improves digestion. This posture also exerts pressure on the abdominal organs and helps people suffering from diabetes.Thirdly, Dhanurasana strengthens and regulates the pancreas and abdominal muscles and is also recommended for people with diabetes. It's also a good stress and fatigue buster.Besides these, three other asanas also help massage and tone the abdominal and pelvic organs including Paschimottanasana, Ardhya Matsyendrasana and Shavasana for relaxing and rejuvenating the body. Since high blood pressure or hypertension can worsen diabetes, yogasanas are helpful in controlling hypertension. Nadi Shodhan Pranayama is also good for diabetics as it helps release stress and flush out toxins from the body.Apart from these, Sudarshan Kriya is a unique rhythmic breathing technique that helps flush out toxins from the body and provides relief from stress. It also improves concentration of antioxidants from external sources. Sudarshan Kriya has a direct impact on disease process itself and is relevant in diabetes management."

Scientists at the city-based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) have discovered that the seeds and tuber of blue water lily are capable of effectively controlling the blood glucose and lipid levels in persons suffering from diabetes and obesity. They also contain chemicals that can delay the process of ageing and related brain and neurological problems.The blue water lily or Nymphaea nouchali grows as a weed in lakes and ponds in several parts of India including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Since its seeds and tuber were consumed by people during severe food crisis in the past, the blue water lily has come to be known as 'famine food'. The IICT researchers have decoded the nutritional and medicinal secrets of this famine food. They suggest that people should include Nymphaea in regular diet to maintain blood glucose and fat levels under check.""The plant works on pancreas and intestines and controls the blood glucose level. It works effectively after a meal by reducing the diet-induced blood sugar level. It also controls the lipid (fat) level,"" said the IICT scientists in their study published in the latest issue of the scientific journal, Cogent Food and Agriculture . The team comprised Ashok K Tiwari, U Priyanka, Amtul Zehra and others.The researchers found that the extract from seeds and tuber also prevents formation of various 'advanced glycation end-products' that contribute to ageing and degeneration of the nervous system.""Nymphaea nouchali may become an important dietary supplement to counter development of diet-induced hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar level), hyperlipidaemia (high lipid level) and resultant oxidative stress. It can also be utilised as an herbal therapeutic for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity,"" they said.The blue lily is used in traditional systems of medicine including Ayurveda and Unani as a brain tonic and antibiotic. This is, however, the first time that scientists have found that the plant could also be used to control diabetes, obesity and ageing."

He also spoke about setting up a mineral water bottling plant within the factory area at Dharbandora.The factory has reported losses crossing 80 crore and a technical committee has suggested an immediate need for upgradation of the four-decade-old factory. Following the suggestion, the factory has already submitted a proposal of modernization at the cost of 30 crore, which is still pending approval of the government.On Monday, Parsekar expressed his happiness that the crushing season began little early this year with an expectation of crushing over a lakh metric tonnes of cane this year.Fearing breakdown of the factory, while in full operation, simply due to old machinery, co-operative secretary Padma Jaiswal expressed his wish to modernize the plant.Though the plant is functional for around 100 to 125 days a year, it needs maintenance after the crushing season ends. This year, 1.4 crore has been spent to repair and maintain the machinery, revealed a factory official.Parsekar has also hinted that the long-pending mineral water bottling plant may be started to reduce the loss being suffered by the co-operative for the last several years. The industries department had agreed to finance the project costs to the amount of 1.75 crore. A project proposal has been already submitted to the department in August 2015.The plant is expected to earn a turnover of 9.24 crore per annum against its working capital of 8.15 crore per annum, leading to an expected profit margin of 1.09 crore."

The announcement is meant to stop the flow of black money only. The relaxed rules for wedding purposes are actually not that hard and fast either.

Even the family members of the surgeon, who spearheaded the surgery, helped him counting the stones.It is for the first time, such a large number of gallstones were removed in the SMS hospital. The gallbladder was twice the size of a normal gallbladder.Even CT scan also failed to find out that there were so much stones in the gallbladder. ""In the CT scan report , it was not clearly mentioned that the gallbladder had stones. It was mentioned that there could be a possibility of stones. The stones were in such a huge quantity that CT scan too failed to diagnose the problem,"" Dr Jeevan Kankaria, associate professor, department of general surgery, SMS hospital said.Dr Kankaria said, ""On the basis of CT scan report, we suspected that the patient was suffering from Acalculous cholecystitis, which is an inflammatory disease of the gallbladder without evidence of gallstones.

The biggest gallbladder was of the size of 3.2mm. Some were 2mm or 2.5 mm size. The colour of the stone was blackish. Normally, stones in gallbladder have brownish colour because they are formed due to cholesterol.There are three kinds of stones -mix stone, cholesterol stone and pigment stone. The stones, which were removed from the patient, were mix stones as it has 70% pigment and 30% cholesterol. Dr Kankaria said, ""It could be because of diabetes, the patient had so much stones as diabetes aggravate such problems in a patient.""The surgeons have now sent the samples of stones removed for analysis in the laboratory to find out exact cause of such stones in a patient.With severe condition, the patient was admitted to the hospital in SMS hospital on November 17 but the doctors could not operate him for the next seven days due to unsuccessful attempts to control his sugar level. On November 23, doctors operated the patient using laparoscopic technique.According to the doctors, the case was not only complicated but was also risky. Vinod Sharma's gallbladder was two times bigger than a usual one and was completely filled with gallstones without any bile in it. ""Luckily, there were no stones found in common bile duct (CBD). There were more than 11,800 stone in his gallbladder but not a single stone was found in CBD, which could cause jaundice in the patient,"" Dr Kankaria said.The surgeons conducted the laparoscopic surgery through 1.2cm incision only which took around one hour.This operation was required to be done through open surgical method only due to immense swelling, diabetes and severe infection but the surgeons were able to do it laparoscopic because of the latest equipment available in SMS hospital.Vinod Sharma said, ""I was suffering from pain in abdomen for the past two year.

He has been operating a licensed export firm, Trade International The withdrawn money was deposited into his relatives' accounts. Besides, the firm had not exported anything to Bulgaria, making ED suspicious.They also added that the deal might have been done in violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act.

58d7a04da3d24b75f276d84d,Calorie is new MRP for packaged food,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Calorie-is-new-MRP-for-packaged-food/articleshow/56264147.cms,2016-12-31,"MUMBAI: As consumers become more mindful about what they eat, 'calorie' count is the new 'MRP' for packaged food products. Traditionally, nutritional information is printed on the back of a product pack, while MRP (maximum retail price) is used as the unique selling proposition for the price-sensitive consumer.Now, to engage with the new-age, calorie conscious consumer, marketers are turning conventional wisdom on its head and displaying nutritional information on front of the pack. Some players are highlighting low calorie count to promote products.For instance, take the packaging of recently launched Kosh oats. It is designed in such a manner that back of the pack with nutritional information is actually the front side, while MRP appears on the reverse side. On the other hand, the new Coca-Cola pop can advertisement highlights 'less than 100 calories ' prominently to grab the attention of cognizant consumers.Devendra Chawla, group president  food FMCG , Future Group, said: ""When consumers interested in health, pick up a pack of food product, they turn to back of the pack first to get vital information regarding calories and nutrients. We have applied this insight to launch Kosh oats, where such key information is highlighted in bold on front of the pack. Price is not as boldly displayed. Today, calories and other nutritional information are the new denomination for a set of consumers,"" said Chawla.The decision on Kosh's packaging is no doubt risky, but Chawla believes it's going to change the way India eats. The sales target for Kosh is Rs 75-80 crore for the first year.The trend could become more pronounced in impulse-driven categories, triggering innovation. In a global announcement, Swiss foods and drinks multinational, Nestle spoke about a scientific breakthrough of nearly halving sugar content in its chocolate, while keeping the taste intact. As and when Nestle launches this product, calories could, in all probability, be the selling point.According to Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India, calories are just one manifestation of the 'nutritional value' of a product. Since the consumers today are keen to know what ""goes into"" their products, Narayanan said, declarations must include clear and simple indications on amount of energy (calories), protein, carbohydrates, fat, sugar and other important nutrients that the product provides, like fibre, vitamins and minerals. ""Consumers today look for transparent information on packs or via other modes like QR codes or company websites, which helps them in choosing food on basis of their nutritional need. The days when MRP and price points were almost sole vectors of consumer choice are fast fading away to an era where soul of the brand is taking primacy,"" said Narayanan.Food products, which were hitherto marketed by highlighting the price among other 4Ps (product, price, place and promotion) of marketing, are now being sold on the basis of their nutritional value including calorie counts. Lower the calories, better the prospects of a brand to gain consumer acceptance.Cutting calories in soft drinks is also a challenge faced by cola drink majors, as they witness consumers shifting to healthier alternatives. The Coca-Cola pop can ad is just a case in point. Going forward, more ads pivoted around calorific information cannot be ruled out."

Ajit Sethiya, national vice-president of the Confederation of All India Traders, said they feared that the volume of trade would drop further unless the cash situation improved soon.Watch What Else is Making NewsOn an average, the Pune market sees trade worth Rs 30 crore in non-perishable goods.Trade in perishable agricultural goods such as vegetables has seen a significant slide since last month or so as retail markets have been severely hit due to demonetisation.However, non-perishable goods such as grains, pulses and sugar etc were insulated from its effects for some time. Now, retail traders have started complaining about low uptake by the end consumers, which has bought the trade to a virtual standstill. Retail traders normally buy their goods from wholesale markets for future trade, said Sethiya.For every 1,500 households, there are 12 retail grocery shops in Pune. These shops normally buy from wholesale markets in anticipation of future demand. But after demonetisation, people have become cautious about using loose cash, so the retail business has suffered, he said.The lesser uptake in the retail sector has affected wholesale markets, which have seen a dip in business of over 30 per cent, said Sethiya. As supply remains steady and demand becomes sparse due to the cash crunch, prices in wholesale markets have also gone down significantly.In case the cash situation does not improve soon, the volume of trade would fall further, he said. Over the next few days, the fall in prices would be visible in retail markets also, said Sethiya. In the initial days, many of the retailers issued goods on credit to their customers, who didnt have enough cash. As the cash situation has not improved much over a month after demonetisation, small retailers have significantly reduced their holdings and stopped buying from wholesale retailers.While some retailers have started using alternative payment platforms like Point of Sales (POS) machines and e-wallets, majority of retailers are finding it difficult to make the switch, said Sethiya. Most of them are from outside Pune the usage of such technology is an operational constraint for them, he said.Various merchants associations have taken up the task of educating the retailers about using these platforms but the response, said Sethiya, was far from satisfactory.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Marathwada has, by far, seen the largest price rush with some millers announcing Rs 900 above their FRP as the first installment price.Sugar millers in Maharashtra have embarked on a price war in order to attract cane from growers as paucity of cane threatens to severely affect their sugar production this crushing season. Millers, especially from Pune, Solapur and the districts of Marathwada, have announced the first installment prices way above their normal fair and remunerative prices (FRP).With only 6.5 lakh hectares of cane area, the crushing season 2016-17 is supposed to be a short one. Paucity of cane has especially been acute in the districts of Marathwada, Pune and Solapur where millers are now hard-pressed to source cane.On an average, the first installments announced by millers are Rs 400-600 more than the FRP. In Pune, 10 mills have announced first installment prices above the FRP with the prices ranging from Rs 2,400- 2,550 per quintal of cane crushed.Mills in this area normally pay FRP in the range of Rs 2,200- 2,300 per quintal of cane crushed. The competition is fierce in Solapur, where millers have adopted the same formula even though the FRP of the region is between Rs 1,664-Rs 2175 per quintal of cane crushed. Millers here have announced the first installment at Rs 2,550 per quintal.Marathwada has, by far, seen the largest price rush with some millers announcing Rs 900 above their FRP as the first installment price. With just 26 out of 51 mills operational in this region, most of the mills are trying hard to attract cane before the season runs out.The price war is led by private millers in Marathwada, while both cooperative and private mills are in the price race in Pune and Solapur. The short season and paucity of cane had prompted Swambhimani Shetkari leader Raju Shetti to ask for Rs 3,200 as the first installment payment for cane during his Oosh Parishad (cane conclave) at Jaishingpur, Kolhapur district two months back.The cane growers had finally agreed to accept price of Rs 175, in addition to the FRP, as their first installment payment.Senior officials from the sugar commissionerate said the price war is basically to attract cane growers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

South African captain Faf du Plessis happens to be one of them. In the recent Test against Australia, he had a lolly on his tongue when he used his spit to shine the ball. Caught on tape, the ICC fined him, denying him his entire match fee. It was seen as a code of conduct breach, condemned as an unlawful act of changing the ball condition. Du Plessis says he did no wrong, he was merely shinning the ball, not doctoring it. He appealed. Now, the ICC isnt pleased, an intriguing inquest is on the cards and, in all likelihood, crickets ever-changing rule book might see yet another rewrite.As expected, the ICC is isolated; du Plessis has received overwhelming support. Aussie skipper Steve Smith said his team too shines the ball like the South African. The undetectable English sarcasm was hard to miss when English pacer Chris Woakes asked the ICC to ban candies. The ambiguity of the law has triggered wide-spread indignation. The ball can be glowed by salty sweat but not by sugary saliva. And what if a player shines the ball seconds after spitting out the toffee, doesnt the objectionable sugar linger in his mouth and travel on to the fading lacquer? Next, will the umpire be strapped with rinse bowls or will the ICC call for spit-tests to check the sugar content?Cricket, intrinsically an amateur game that not too long ago played on the belief that anyone wearing flannels was a gentleman, has repeatedly struggled to be part of professional sports where every advantage is ruthless exploited. No doubt, with time, the rules need to change. However, law-makers need to be sympathetic to bowlers, crickets under-privileged. Bats have become bigger, pitches died long back, bouncers are rationed, now cant the pacer shine the ball?

With farm labourers not trained, precision farming was abandoned by over 50 per cent of farmers.Kamalakannan himself pleaded guilty on that count and said the benefits of the schemes will be adopted only when those at the ground level have been trained properly. Not only agriculturists, but also agricultural labourers should be trained to use modern technologies and this should be assessed periodically.Kamalakannan said farmers and those engaged in water management will have to adopt new technologies because of issues such as increasing population, overdrawing groundwater, intrusion of saline water and water-pollution. The CGWB is taking steps to enhance water resources, he said adding that a map of the underground water resources would be beneficial to those in water management.Kamalakannan said the main crops in Puducherry are paddy and sugar cane, both of which are water intensive crops.He said five lakh litres of water are required for cultivating one acre of paddy. Similarly, 12 lakh litres of water are required for cultivating one acre of sugarcane, he said. So it is essential that farmers should switch over to precision farming.There were 40,000 hectares of agricultural land 15 years ago, which had shrunk to 10,000 hectares because of the conversion of fertile land into housing plots. Encroachments have also brought down othe acreage of agri land, the minister said."

I have been approached by officers with anger management and frustration issues. This happens as they are not able to give their 100% to whatever they have committed to their family members.

58d7c728a3d24b75f276fb9e,"PIL introduced 35 years ago, yet no clarity on who can file it",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/PIL-introduced-35-years-ago-yet-no-clarity-on-who-can-file-it/articleshow/55930364.cms,2016-12-12,"NEW DELHI: Three-and-a-half decades ago, the Supreme Court in S P Gupta case on December 30, 1981, broke away from legal orthodoxy to evolve a unique device - public interest litigation or PIL. Those involved in affairs of the poor and the voiceless could file PILs before the SC and high courts to seek protection of rights of people condemned to live on the fringe.Though formal coinage of the term 'PIL' happened in the S P Gupta case, it was advocate Kapila Hingorani who was the first to file a 'PIL' on behalf of hundreds of undertrial prisoners in Bihar, who languished in jail for periods which were much more than the maximum punishment they would have got if convicted. The SC decided Hingorani's petition, Hussainara Khatoon vs Bihar Home Secretary, on March 9, 1979 and ruled that ""every accused unable to engage a lawyer or secure legal services has a constitutional right to get free legal services, the cost of which must be borne by the state"".The underlying intention in creating this special device was to universalise access to justice. After Hussainara Khatoon, the SC while dealing with another PIL by NGO 'Bandhua Mukti Morcha', had secured the release of thousands of bonded labourers, many of them minors, from stone quarries in Haryana.Advocate M C Mehta moved a PIL in the SC in 1985 seeking protection of environment and enforcement of Delhiites' right to clean air. Even after 30 years, this PIL survives as the court has used it as a base to deal with many environmental issues. Mehta went on to win the Magsaysay award. Despite winning the award, Mehta remained as simple as he was when he had filed the PIL. But the resultant fame and money did not escape the notice of advocates, who now aspire to walk in Mehta's footsteps. This explains why so many advocates are seeking fame daily through PILs in the SC and HCs. Many genuine PILs are still filed. But a majority is frivolous, filed by lawyers who have no knowledge of the issue or cause they seek to highlight. On many occasions, PILs have been filed in the SC after coming to know of an incident from the morning paper.PILs have touched all issues under the sun. It has become a fashion to file a PIL and seek immediate publicity in the media. That was certainly not the SC's intention when it devised the instrument to make justice reach those standing last in society.This was explained by the SC in People's Union for Democratic Rights [1982 AIR 1473]. It had said, ""If sugar barons and alcohol kings have the fundamental right to carry on their business and to fatten their purses by exploiting the consuming public, have the 'chamars' belonging to the lowest strata of society no fundamental right to earn an honest living through their sweat and toil? The former can approach the courts with a formidable army of distinguished lawyers paid in four or five figures per day and if their right to exploit is upheld against the government under the label of fundamental right, the courts are praised for their boldness and courage and their independence and fearlessness and are applauded and acclaimed.""But if the fundamental right of the poor and helpless victims of injustice is sought to be enforced by public interest litigation, the so-called champions of human rights frown upon it as a waste of time of the highest court in the land, which, according to them, should not engage itself in such small and trifling matters. Moreover, these self-styled human rights activists forget that civil and political rights, priceless and invaluable as they are for freedom and democracy, simply do not exist for the vast masses of our people."" Times have changed considerably in the last 35 years. Changing times have convoluted the priorities of PILs. This was explained by the SC in 2004 in Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware case. It had said, ""Public Interest Litigation, which has now come to occupy an important field in the administration of law, should not be 'publicity interest litigation' or 'private interest litigation' or 'politics interest litigation' or the latest trend 'paise income litigation'.It is depressing to note that on account of such trumpery proceedings initiated before the courts, innumerable days are wasted, which time otherwise could have been spent for the disposal of cases of the genuine litigants."" In Janata Dal vs H S Chowdhary [1992 (4) SCC 305], the SC had said, ""Only a person acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in the proceeding of PIL will have locus standi and can approach the court to wipe out the tears of the poor and needy, suffering from violation of their fundamental rights, but not a person for personal gain or private profit or political motive or any oblique consideration. Similarly, a vexatious petition under the colour of PIL brought before the court for vindicating any personal grievance, deserves rejection at the threshold.""The time has come for the SC to invent a procedure to separate real PILs from the other kind of PILs which were explained in the Thaware case more than a decade ago."

The ban on brewing wine at homes has left many Anglo Indian families miffed, as making the fruity wines has been a Christmas tradition dating back generations. ""Wine is to Anglo families what Avakai (mango pickle) is to South Indian homes,"" implored MLA Christine Lazarus urging the government to revoke the ban, but to no avail. As a result, wine making has now become a hush-hush affair in the city, rues Warren La Touche , President of the Anglo Indian Association , Telangana. ""This year there is no huge sale of wine. Two-three families are getting together to make wine for themselves and their relatives in small quantities. The government has no problem with that. The problem was caused by a few wine makers who commercialised wine making started storing hundreds and hundreds of drums. They broke the rules and so they were caught. It is a classic case of a few bad apples spoiling the entire lot. As a result lot of people got scared and stopped making wine altogether,"" says Warren.For many like Dennis Powell , a renowned music teacher in the city, wine making was an integral part of Christmas celebrations. ""My sister-in-law would make grape wine every year. The process would begin in October itself and she would store it in ceramic pickle jars. The wine would be distributed within the family a couple of weeks before Christmas. So whenever, we had relatives at home we'd serve wine and cake, and it was such a lovely time. Thinking about the wine makes me also remember my mother's chicken roast which went so well with the wine,"" reminisces Dennis.Dean Stracey, a resident of Sainikpuri echoes similar sentiments sharing his childhood memories of wine making.

I would squish the grapes with my fingers and half the juice would splatter all over my clothes. It was so much fun. We would then put brown sugar in it and store it in wooden barrels,"" recalls Dean.Adding that Christmas isn't just the same without homemade wine, he says, ""The entire family would get together and have meals around the table at my grand father's place.

The families used to serve rose cookies and cakes as well. And when you take the first sip of wine, they'd look with so much anticipation. If you said you liked it, their eyes would twinkle with pride,"" recollects Melanie.The clampdown on homemade wine has forced many to turn to branded wine which is very expensive. ""Wine making is a tradition for us. It isn't a money making racquet. Everything is done almost at a cost to cost basis,"" says Dennis, a resident of Masab Tank.Dominic Shroron, a business analyst who lives in Safilguda says, ""For the last two-three years, we've just being buying branded Scottish wine for Christmas. After a few people got arrested, many don't go and buy homemade wine out of fear of getting caught. It's a sad situation. Homemade wine has a different essence and taste to it.""Warren feels the government must take a leaf out of Goan authorities' book in regulating wine making. ""In Goa, the government permits people to brew wine provided they follow the regulations. A similar model could be implemented in Hyderabad too, at least during the festive season,"" he says.This year there is no huge sale of wine. Two-three families can get together and make wine for themselves and their relatives in small quantities, which is perfectly fine. The government has no problem with that.

The poll-bound state registered record sugar production, pipping Maharashtra to become the highest producer of sugar for this year.Sources in the UP sugar industry said the quantity of cane reaching sugar mills had increased significantly after traditional crushers and kolhus (jaggery units) which produce low quality khandsari sugar and gur, respectively, could not operate because of the cash crisis.In UP, around 20% of total sugarcane often gets diverted to traditional crushers who pay cash to the farmers instantly. ""This time, the cash crisis appears to have stopped that diversion. As a result, there was a substantial rise in the quantum of cane reaching the mills,"" said an official from UP Sugar Mills Association The official, however, added that it cannot be said with certainty that the diversion stopped completely.Figures from Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) too show that the sugar production this year has been significantly higher compared to last year's.In case of UP, it has already doubled to 17.66 lakh tonne (as on December 15, 2016) from 8.52 lakh tonne in the corresponding period last year.Maharashtra, on the other hand, saw a substantial drop in sugar production. Against 164 mills which produced 22.50 lakh tonnes of sugar in 2015, production has dipped to 17.25 lakh tonnes from 144 mills operating this year.Industry sources said the higher sugar production in UP is also the result of use of high-yielding cane variety as well as early start of sugar mills in UP.This year, UPSMA sources said, mills started functioning as early as first week of November, as against late November or early December last year.Sources said some mills fired their boilers soon after November 8 when denomination was announced. ISMA records show that against 105 mills last year, 115 had started their operation by mid-December. ""Farmers were not willing to take old currency notes and therefore decided to put their produce in sugar mills,"" a miller said on the condition of anonymity.In case of Karnataka, 60 sugar produced 11 lakh tonnes of sugar. This is about 0.71 lakh tonnes higher than the sugar production in 2015-16.Like Maharashtra, sugar production also dropped in Gujarat where 19 mills produced 2.40 lakh tonnes of sugar, as against 3.32 lakh tonnes till mid-December 2015.In all, as on December 15 this year, 440 sugar mills across the country produced 53.29 lakh tonnes of sugar. This was 5.36 lakh tonnes (11%) higher than the sugar production on the corresponding date of previous sugar season."

Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Wednesday showed inflation , as measured by the wholesale price index rose annual 3.2% in November, slower than previous month's 3.4%.The softening in WPI inflation comes close on the heels of retail inflation easing to a two-year low of 3.6% in November. The government revised upwards the inflation for September to 3.8% from the previously reported 3.6%.The move to scrap some high value currency notes has dented consumer demand and hurt industries and there have been demands for a cut in interest rates to boost demand.The latest data showed food inflation slowed to 1.5% in November, compared to 4.3% rise in the previous month. RBI relies largely on the retail inflation measure although it takes into account all price data, while finalising monetary policy.The WPI data showed vegetable prices slid 24.1% in November, while onion prices contracted 51.5%. But some pressure points were visible as wheat prices rose 10.7%, potato 36.9% year-on-year and sugar 31.7% during the month. The fuel, power and light index rose 7% in November, up from previous month's 6.2%.""WPI inflation has come at 3.15% due to subdued food prices. However, we expect the rate to hover around 4% mainly due to firming up of core inflation and a rise in food prices once the base effect weakens. Also the rabi crop will be critical in driving future prices as the present cash crunch has slowed down the rabi sowing especially for wheat,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings said."

Government has set a target of increasing this blending of ethanol in petrol to 10% in its bid to reduce import of crude oil. Ethanol is produced from sugarcane molasses. Blending of ethanol in petrol helps in saving fuel , and consequently foreign exchange.""During 2014-15 crop year, a total of about 68 crore litres of ethanol was produced and in the previous year it was only 37 crore litres. During last crop year, we, in association with the petroleum ministry, developed a national grid to improve the supply of ethanol to oil marketing companies. Sugar mills close to the oil depots linked,"" said a food ministry official. In November 2012, the UPA Cabinet had approved 5% mandatory blending of ethanol with petrol, which was notified by the Centre under the Motor Spirits Act in January 2013. Oil companies had to record this target by June 2013.Earlier this year, Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said that it was found that blending can be raised up to 15-20% for both ethanol in petrol and biodiesel without a major change in existing car engines.Sources said during this sugar season the ethanol production may be less than the achievement of last crop year due to less sugarcane production in Maharashtra."

He was let off at 9pm after a 12-hour-long interrogation by Thane income-tax sleuths. In the meantime, raids were carried out at his residence in Thane. Gawde (43) is believed to have told the investigating officers that the money is accounted for.Matoshree may have a tough time keeping a safe distance from Gawde, observers said.Although Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday sought to downplay Gawde's detention which took place earlier in the day at Nalasopara in a joint operation by crime branch's Vasai unit and Thane incometax officials, sources in the BJP said the issue could be a source of ""great embarrasment"" for the party. The deputy chiefship of the Thane district Sena unit is said to be a key post in the party's organizational hierarchy.Acting on a tip-off, a trap was laid for Gawde's car on Nalasopara-Virar Link Road since 5am. The car was intercepted around 8.30am. A total cash of Rs 1.1 crore was found in the car's boot. Nalasopara-based hotelier Sudarshan Shereghar (32) was detained with him.Gawde, a businessman, is house leader of the Sena in VVMC. The municipality is ruled by the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) party of MLA Hitend ra Thakur. Gawde has moved the Bombay high court against the BVA for not allowing the Sena to sit in the opposition.Meanwhile, speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a party function at Sena Bhavan, Thackeray recalled a similar case involving BJP minister Subhash Deshmukh on November 17 when a sum of Rs 91.5 lakh was found in a vehicle in Umergaon in the Osmanabad district. The car reportedly be longed to Deshmukh. The BJP minister later claimed that the cash was meant for payment to labourers of a sugar cooperative factory, which is affiliated to the Lok Mangal group.Continuing his attack on the Modi regime for scrapping high currency notes, Thackeray said while financial assistance was being sent to Kashmiri fundamentalists on a silver platter at their residence, hard-working and honest citi zens were being forced to queue up. Thackeray riled the Centre for banning district cooperative banks from carrying out financial transactions. ""Vijay Mallya didn't borrow from cooperative banks,"" the Sena president said, adding, ""I will not make the citizens stand in queues."" However, the BJP was quick to smell a political opportunity in Sena's trouble. ""Gawde's detention is a slap on the Sena's face,"" said a state BJP functionary ."

Traders say that they are not in a position to pay sugarcane farmers for their produce.Uncertainty prevails in the market, said joint secretary of the Tamil Nadu jaggery Merchants Association K Kamaraj . ""Future looks bleak as each of these markets used to trade jaggery worth not less than 1 crore every month. Only when the new currency notes come into circulation and we are able to give them freely and operate current accounts, will we be able to open the markets again,"" he said.Sugarcane farmers are already affected by the drought condition and sugar mills are yet to pay them their dues. ""The government should at least have taken steps to create awareness among the common people in villages about using debit cards and bank transaction before making the announcement. It will take many years for ordinary farmers to conduct bank transactions using cards and cheques,"" Kamaraj told TOI.Jaggery made from sugarcane juice is in demand in Kerala, where it is an essential commodity and also in Tamil Nadu during the festival season. Farmers bring their produce directly to the markets in Palani. As most of them are illiterate, they don't have debit cards or cheque books and always demand cash. Traders, who have not been able to pay the farmers, have called for the closing of the markets.Secretary of the Palani jaggery Market Traders Association Jahir said that with the festival season expected to start in December, they would be severely affected due to demonetisation. ""jaggery auction is held on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but as the traders could not give the farmers their money, most of them took back their produce and as a result, the traders decided to close the market indefinitely. If the cash flow is not restored, we would have to put off the reopening of the market,"" he said.A bundle of 30 kilograms of jaggery called 'sippam' is selling for about 1,500 as it is the off-season. But, next month, the supply usually increases and price goes down to about 900. The demand will be high as people use them for making Pongal and other sweetmeats. The Sabarimala season is also contributing to the increased demand as about 10,000 sippam are sold every week. This Diwali season, 25,000 sippam were sold.When it was announced that the old 500 and 1,000 notes would not be accepted, the traders had tried to pay the farmers for the first two weeks, but now it has become impossible.""The traders are giving us 2,000 notes for which we have no change. What will we do with them?"" asked T Palani, a farmer. He is among the farmers who will stop cutting sugarcanes till the markets start."

On the other hand, 9% Muslims and 8.2% Hindus suffer from high blood sugar. The Sudheer Commission on the ""socio-economic and educational conditions of Muslims in Telangana,"" appointed by the state government, came out with data on the health status of Hindus and Muslims. It took into consideration systolic blood pressure higher than 129 and diastolic pressure more than 84 to arrive at hypertension. For blood sugar, values higher than 140 were considered. Data of Hindus and Muslims above 20 years of age was obtained for the analysis.""It is interesting to note that from the age groups of 20-29 years to 30-39 years, the prevalence of blood pressure increases by 14 percentage points among Muslim males, whereas in the case of Hindus it is 12 percentage points. But overall, the blood pressure levels are lower among Muslims. However, the prevalence of blood sugar among Muslims is higher than Hindus.Among Hindus and Muslims, those who smoke have 3-2% higher prevalence compared to those who do not smoke,"" the report stated. The rural-urban difference in blood sugar-level among Muslims is quite significant with five percentage point higher rates in urban areas. It may be due to lack of physical activity among Muslims living in crowded urban areas.In the case of Hindus, the blood pres sure-level is higher than Muslims in all districts except Hyderabad. ""The prevalence of blood sugar among Muslims in most districts is higher than Hindus. In Karimnagar, Khammam, Nizamabad, Nalgonda, and Hyderabad, more than 10% adults suffer from the problem of high blood sugar. Among Hindus, the prevalence of blood sugar is more than 10 percentage points in Nizamabad, Rangareddy, Nalgonda and Khammam,"" the report stated.The report did not specify the reasons for the he alth parities, but doctors attributed it to the food habits and lifestyles. While many Hindus consume foods that increase the blood pressure levels, a majority of Muslims feast on foods rich in carbohydrate and sugar. Dr Aftab Ahmad, specialist in internal medicine, Apollo Hospitals, Secunderabad, said, ""It could be due to dietary habits and lifestyle conditions. Many Muslims do not have physical activity as a majority of them live in slums and crowded places.Their calorie intake is also very high as they eat non-vegetarian food and dishes rich in carbohydrates."" The report also throws light on the utilisation of health facilities. Around 70% Hindus prefer private healthcare facilities. Among Muslims, around 47% prefer private and 53% prefer government health facilities. The coverage of health insurance shows 71% Hindus and Muslims avail the facility. The Arogyasri insurance scheme has the highest percentage coverage (95%) among both Hindus and Muslims."

Binge eating without exercise have made Hyderabadi women the most obese in the country. They have overtaken their counterparts in other Indian cities on the BMI index. These shocking stats came after the National Family Health Survey-4 of 766 households comprising 830 women, which revealed 47.9% Hyderabadi women were obese in the 14-49 age-group.Zainab, a city resident, weighed 165kg on her 24 th birthday before she opted for bariatric surgery at city-based hospital in March this year. She could hardly move and her mammoth weight and short stature made surgical intervention extremely difficult. Now, she weighs 95 kg. Not just Zainab, several women like her can't climb stairs, have high blood sugar levels, feel ashamed to socialize and are sinking into depression. Also, Hyderabadi women have beaten men on the obesity chart. Only 33.7% men surveyed in the city were found obese. Those with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 kgm2 are termed overweight.According to NFHS survey, obesity among women in other cities stands at 40.7% in Kolkata, 34% in Mumbai, 33.6% in Chennai and 33.4% in Bengaluru.Dr P Arokiasamy of Mumbaibased International Institute for Population Sciences, which conducted NFHS-4, said lack of balanced nutrition, especially in micronutrients also contribute to high obesity in urban areas. ""Past health surveys showed improper nutrition was not only found among urban poor, but even among the well-off,'' he said.""Part of the blame can be pinned on easy access to junk food and sedentary lifestyle. Whether it's ordering tasty , but unhealthy food or getting a cab at one's doorstep without the need to walk, more and more women are falling victim to obesity,"" said Dr V Amar, chief consultant, metabolic & bariatric surgery, Continental Hospitals.In fact, women in all five top Indian cities (except Kolkata) were obese when compared to men, making weight gain a trend among the fairer sex. This is being attributed to higher concentration of body fat among women on a height-and-weight scale.Pointing out that fe male hormones and birth control pills can raise fat deposition in women, Dr Amar said, ""Total body fat is controlled by gut hormones. Overeating and lack of exercise can influence these hor mones and trigger high fat deposition. If there is genetic ten dency, this influence is even more.""Another trigger for over-eating is psychological. Depression and anxiety, affects many housewives, said Sujatha Stephen, chief nutritionist, Maxcure Hospitals, Hyderabad.The consequences are disastrous as obesity is a getaway to diseases like diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, lung disorders and early arthritis. What's worse, there are no effective medication to reduce weight.""We cannot modify genetic predisposition to obesity, but lifestyle changes, dieting and exercise can help reduce weight. Those morbidly obese can opt for bariatric surgery after conservative methods fail,"" said Dr Hari Kishan Boorugu, consultant physician, Apollo Hospital, Hyderguda."

The mill I sold to owes me a payment of Rs 53 crore from last year's sale, and there is no clarity on what will happen this year.""While the stand off between the sugarcane farmers and sugar mills may be an old one, smaller businesses, and ancillary units are hit.

They also demanded the Union government to ease the rules so that workers could get their wages which have been held up due to demonetization.""Mahatma Phule in 1880 had given a call for social boycott of the money lenders forcing the then British regime to intervene and take appropriate action.

The Delhi CM and the minster have been in non-stop verbal duel for weeks now.Named 'Majha Fathe' rally by AAP, the event is likely to witness Kejriwal announcing the name of party candidate to be fielded against Majitha, who is brother-in-law of deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and brother of Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. The AAP chief has been publically accusing the minister of being involved in drug trade in Punjab and threatening to put him behind bars once AAP comes to power in the state. Majitiha has responded by refuting the charges and challenging Kejriwal to contest against him in the 2017 state assembly election.On Tuesday, AAP leaders said that they had made arrangement for over one lakh people for the rally, which will begin at 1 pm on Wednesday. However, AAP candidate from Amritsar (South) assembly constituency Inderbir Singh Nijjar alleged that he had received reports of tearing up of party banners in Majitha. He alleged that in another village AAP's flag was tilted by some mischief-makers. They were apprehensive that their political rivals might pressurize their supporters, he added.Already, a team of AAP observers, poll strategists and rally planners is camping in Amritsar for the success of the rally. Sources said that a special team of locals, including former 'loyalists' of Majithia, had been constituted to keep an eye on anyone trying to disrupt the rally or create obstacles.AAP spokesperson Gurbhej Singh said the rally would be held at Majitha grain market and they had made all preparations for the event.AMRITSAR: AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal addressed a rally at Tarn Taran on Tuesday. Speaking in Akali stronghold, the Delhi CM said, ""The Badal government has failed to identify and punish the accused involved in the incident of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and those responsible for the deaths of innocent protesters in Bargari. This raised doubt about intentions of Badals.""He also promised action on these fronts if voted to power. ""AAP will ensure severe punishment in desecration case so that nobody can even think of repeating the incidence in future,"" he said.The Delhi CM also took up the issues of border villages and assured to revive the old industrial hubs in the district. ""This border district has been ignored by Akalis and the Congress since its formation. After forming the government in 2017, AAP will revive the industrial hub at Goindwal Sahib and Sheron sugar mill which will provide ample employment opportunities to the youth of this area,"" he said.Ahead of his Majitha rally, Kejriwal once again lashed out at Majithia. He alleged, ""AAP will put Bikram in jail and punish him for ruining the youth of Punjab by spreading drug trade.""He said AAP would stop illegal mining, cable and transport mafia thriving under the political patronage.Majithia challenges Kejriwal to contest from MajithaPunjab cabinet minister Bikram Majithia challenged Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to contest Punjab assembly election against him from Majitha. Talking to newspersons on the eve of Kejriwal's rally at Majitha, Majithia alleged that the AAP leader was daydreaming of gaining power in Punjab with fake promises as he did in Delhi. He claimed that Kejriwal stood exposed on various fronts for his alleged lies and promising moon to the people. ""Kejriwal has made life of Delhi people miserable as his performance as Delhi CM is a big disaster,"" he alleged."

The vehicle, with Rajasthan registration numbers, was loaded with a consignment of sugar. When the driver informed the owner about the truck being seized, the latter insisted that the truck should be recovered.Sources said that the driver jumped over the walls of the yard and used duplicate keys to get the truck out of the clutches of recovery agents. Owners of the yard raised an alarm and informed the police.The mad rush to catch the truck started when word went around that it was carrying currency notes. People in two-wheelers and cars went to the location where the truck was last seen.Khajrana police were alerted after the truck was stopped on Ring Road near Velocity Theatre.""Someone sent the word around that it was full of currency notes.

Four cities in the state, including Nashik , have reported higher than the permissible levels of particulate matter in the air.On Monday, Mumbai reported the highest PM10 (diameter less than 10 micron) level in the state at 166 micro gram per cubic metre. Nashik and Pune followed closely with 147 and 148 PM10 levels, respectively. Chandrapur, which is known for its coal mines, reported PM10 level of 133.""The result of daily sampling for 24 hours should be less than 100 microgram per meter cube for PM10 parameter and annual average should be 60. The PM10 levels of 147 recorded in Nashik means that the air pollution has increased,"" said an MPCB (Maharashtra Pollution Control Board) official from the head office in Mumbai.With the rise in air pollution, Nashik may no longer be counted among the cities with salubrious climate unless immediate steps are taken. MPCB regional office, which has been insisting that the air pollution is under control, has now assured of initiating the necessary action.MPCB regional officer R U Patil said, ""It is due to the drop in temperature that dust does not go up. PM levels are found higher than usual during this period. The levels also go up due to regular pollution. We will issue notices to the civic administration.""In the meantime, farmers setting sugar cane stubble on fire after the harvest in November has added to the air pollution in Kolhapur.

Over the past two years, the SPM levels in the months of December, January and February have been well over 400 micro gram a cubic metre, nearly three times the permissible limits. The RSPM levels have been over 110 during these months.Environmentalist Uday Gaikwad said, ""Farmers burn the sugar cane stubble to prepare the farm for the next season. Smog gets easily developed during this period though the particles emitting from the fires do not remain in the air for a long time. Also, the dry grass burnt in the nearby villages adds to the smog."" Activists and officials claim the campaign, Pachat Abhiyan, launched in November 2011 had yielded positive results. The campaign reached out to farmers to prevent burning of after-harvest sugarcane stubble to avoid air pollution and make farmers aware of benefits of using the trash as organic manure in the fields."

Even chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' rally ahead of the polls failed to swing support in her favour. ""I accept defeat. The poll loss cannot be linked to the chief minister,"" she said.Dhananjay said people of Parli trusted his party for the good work it had done in the past five years. ""Even after the BJP sent its brigade of leaders, including CM and finance minister to Parli, citizens voted for NCP,"" he said, while also taking a dig at Congress and independents for lobbying against his party.""Pankaja should not try to hinder the development of Parli by arresting government funds as people were annoyed with such tactics,"" he added.In June this year, a panel led by Pankaja had taken control over Vaidyanath Urban Co-Operative Bank Limited in Parli by defeating the panel supported by Dhananjay. In April, Pankaja received a shot in the arm when her panel won the election to the Vaidyanath cooperative sugar factory.In another major upset for BJP, wife of water supply minister Babanrao Lonikar lost the president's post in the Partur civic body in Jalna district. Interestingly, Lonikar's wife Mandakini had preferred the poll symbol of hand-fan instead of the BJP's lotus.BJP president Raosaheb Danve failed to perform any miracle in key polls in his hometown Jalna district with his party and alliance partners losing three civic body polls out of four.Congress won the Partur, Jalna and Bhokardan municipal council elections, while the BJP could win only Ambad municipal council.

From root to leaves, the trees had many uses. Products from the trees were used for food, wood, shelter and even as the source of toddy. So much was the prominence of the tree in Tamil Nadu that, palmyra was declared as the state tree of Tamil Nadu.However, the trees started losing their prominence after toady tapping was banned in the state and palmyra-based products lost their value as materials like plastic and white sugar were introduced.With the intention of giving a thrust to palmyra tree population, the District Rural Development Agency in Sivaganga will be planting one lakh palm seeds this year. Agencies in other districts are also carrying out tree planting drives. Sivaganga collector S Malarvizhi inaugurated the planting of palm seeds recently at Vaniakudi village in the district. ""The trees have multiple uses starting from the leaves, that are made into housing material and used in craft works. The extract (pathaneer) from palmyra is good for health. Moreover, palmyra trees on banks of water bodies prevent soil erosion. Hence, palmyra cultivation is promoted in the district,"" she said.Sivaganga DRDA project director B Kanchana said that the idea of palm seed plantation was given by the district collector. ""There are a lot of Prosopis juliflora trees near the water bodies here affecting ground water level. Palmyra trees prevent soil erosion and help recharge the water table. So, we have taken up palmyra tree plantation in our district this time,"" she said.The agency has completed planting 30,000 seeds so far and is planning to plant another 20,000 seeds. ""Its a challenge to get adequate palm seeds and we are sourcing them from districts like Kancheepuram, Cuddalore, Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin. We are also paying 1 per seed whenever we don't get them free,"", she added.Veteran politician Kumari Ananthan, who is advocating the cause of palmyra workers in the state, lauded the initiative. ""The word 'thali' (mangalsutra) is derived from palmyra tree because it has another name as Thalamaram,"" he said.""The population of palmyra trees have drastically come down from 5 crore trees to less than 3 crore in the last two decades.

These shops exclusively deal in puja material and other requirements of devotees.This is the season for the Mandali Deeksha (41-day vow). But the sudden move to tackle black money has forced many to put off the rites till the situation improves. Ayyappa devotees invariably wear black clothes and follow a rigid system with special pujas.Taking Deeksha is an elaborate process. As many as 23 pooja items including turmeric powder, sandalwood paste or powder, Kalasa vastram, sugar candy (kalakanda) and black cloth are needed. The cost of these material is about Rs 2,000.Traders in twin cities bring the puja material all the way from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. ""We have already brought stocks, but there are no buyers.

Environmentalists say that it's not just the tree but even its sapling has become a rarity. Nurseries prefer ornamental plants and other native species as they yield more revenue. They must travel to Kerala to buy these saplings. With 15 bird species completely dependent on the tree for nesting and roosting, city environmentalists plan to set up a nursery just to grow palm trees.P Sujana Pal, scientist at Kerala Forest Research Institute , said that a few years ago, they had set up a nursery in Trissur for rare plants and trees and palm was identified as one among them. ""We began developing the palm saplings and also sold it after we realized that there was a steep decline in the population of these trees. The palm tree population has reduced by 60 per cent in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. These trees have an important ecological and economic impact due to its multi-purpose character. They are not only useful to human beings but there are several bird species exclusively dependent on them,"" he said.As per Rajah Jayapal, principal scientist of Salim Ali Centre for ornithology and natural history, birds such as palm swift, Indian roller, ashy wood swallow and Indian black ibis exclusively depend on palm trees for nesting and roosting. ""While a study is yet to be carried out on their population, if palm trees are cut down at the current rate, there will be a considerable impact on these birds as well,"" he said.Local nurseries said they had stopped selling the seeds or saplings as there was lack of demand. ""People only prefer ornamental plants and there is no demand in the market for these trees,"" said K Ramesh at Roja Nursery on Avinashi road. A resident of Madhampatti, Ramesh said a few years ago, these trees were found in hundreds in his village. ""Currently, their numbers have dwindled.

However, after treatment, her blood sugar levels are now controlled, and she swiftly manages to take four insulin dosages in a day without hesitation and embarrassment.There are a multitude of juvenile diabetics across the country and estimates by doctors in the city suggest that 10-12% diabetics are usually type-1 diabetic.

Insulin is the only treatment in type-1 diabetes patients and this can be given through syringes, insulin pens or a novel device called insulin pump.However, doctors claim that there is a lot of stigma attached to kids being affected with type-1 diabetes and it is not limited to confidence issues. ""Such kids often become a burden to their parents, especially those hailing from lower income groups. Focusing on studies and finding a life partner is often difficult for these kids,"" said Dr Yash Patel, a consultant diabetologist.

Almost 65% of the district's sugar is transported to Marathwada, Pune, Mumbai, Rajashthan and Gujarat through roads.Subhash Jadhav, president of Kolhapur District Lorry Association, said, ""The lorry owners in the district engage in the transportation of sugar, vehicles, equipment and textiles. But the demonetisation of old high-value currency notes has affected our business. We are not able to get new orders.

Having such great scope for production of sugarcane and sugar in the district, farmers are feeling insecure to grow sugarcane in their field as there is no support price and there is a big political lobby to keep cane prices low. As a result area of sugarcane cultivation has decreased by 30% this year. Sugarcane is being cultivated on 1.8 lakh hectares this year whereas it was about 2.2 lakh hectares last year.Sugarcane is a major crop in the neighbouring Maharashtra too. Authorities there conducted a meeting of factory owners and farmer leaders and came out with the support price which is FRP+175 per tonne. This means the price will be around Rs 2,700 to 3,000 depending on the recovery of cane in Maharashtra. Farmers there have agreed to this and harvesting has begun. But here in Belagavi, even three weeks after the crushing season began, the government has made no moves to declare support price.Opposing the apathy of the government, sugarcane growers have decided to stage a massive protest during the winter session of the assembly to be held at the Suvarna Vidhan Soudha (SVS) in Belagavi. Farmer leader Basangouda Sidramani said that the area of sugarcane has reduced due to no support price and non-payment of dues by factories. If the government does not declare support price before the session, we will stage a massive protest, he said.Dr R B Khangave, director, S Nijlingappa Sugar Institute, said that a meeting of the Sugarcane Control Board will be held in Bengaluru on Tuesday where the issue of fixing support price for sugarcane will be discussed."

The move, being implemented by National Health Mission under the National Programme for control of non-communicable diseases, is set to cost Rs 5 crore.""No longer a disease of associated only with the elite, diabetes is afflicting people of even the economically weaker section and our effort aims at helping them with better management of the disease,"" said Kumar, ahead of the World Diabetes Awareness Day, November 14.Officials claimed the orders for the insulin pen have been placed and the facility would be available from the first week of December. It may be noted that about 9.5% of adults in UP suffer with high blood glucose, which is the third leading risk factor responsible for premature death. The cost of reusable insulin pen ranges from Rs 600-2,000 in the market.Citing an assessment by national programme for prevention and control of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and strokes, Kumar shared that around 3.7 lakh persons in the state were found to be undergoing treatment for diabetes.Faculty in medicine department of King George's Medical University Prof Kauser Usman said insulin shots are often a diabetic's destiny. ""Oral medication has its limits and insulin shots are the only option at later stages if one is totally optimistic about stem cell therapy. In fact, many physicians prefer insulin therapy over oral pills to conserve leftover insulin releasing beta cells in the pancreas,"" he said.Health activist Bobby Ramakant said the scheme should be extended to specialised institutes like KGMU and Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences which are dealing with diabetes management.""SGPGIMS runs a juvenile diabetes clinic where one can see how useful an insulin pen can be for a child with diabetes. The unit also conducted a study to show that the family of a child with diabetes spends about 18% of its annual income on diabetes management, which means a lot,"" he stated.BOXTimely treatmentA person diagnosed with diabetes must know that the problem had started about 8-10 years ago, which means the problem can be prevented or at least delayed in most cases. Appreciating government effort for management of diabetes among the needy, secretary elect of the Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India Dr Nar Singh Verma said a better idea and bigger need is to spread awareness on steps to prevent diabetes. Citing an example for the need of prevention, Dr Verma said a number of people get their blood sugar checked just to see if they are diabetics and feel happy to see their blood sugar level is normal. ""But that relief is only momentary as it is actually the routine fasting post prandial (PP, after eating) test that gives sugar levels on that day. Only glucose tolerance test can help predict to a reasonable extent if a person is prone to diabetes,"" he explained."

The evaluation came as a rude shock to her parents. She was diagnosed with extremely high sugar level in her blood that boosted up the level of acid in blood as well.""When we heard that our daughter had to live on insulin for the rest of her life, we were shocked. We would always find her in tears, embarrassed, confused and helpless with refusal to take insulin by herself.

Not only has she topped her class in the last examination with promising scores, but is also the class leader. ""I got quite used to taking insulin injections on a regular basis. I don't feel awkward any more. For me, diet monitoring and insulin shots are as normal as breathing air and drinking water for others.

Within days, Olivia developed a urine infection and drastically lost her body weight.""When I noticed her becoming thinner day by day, I took her for a check-up where she was diagnosed to have high blood sugar. While we were depressed and anxious, I was surprised to see my daughter facing the situation better. She never showed any sign of weakness which gave us back our courage to fight along with her,"" said her mother.While the doctors took time to counsel her parents, little Olivia came to terms with reality easily.

But the government was aiming at setting up an 'apparel park', where technology from cotton to fashion industry based on cotton will be displayed. Similar textile parks are also coming up at Wardha, Yavatmal, Buldana, Jamner (Jalgaon) and Majalgaon (Marathwada). These will provide employment to over 10,000 people, he said.Giving himself a pat on the back, the CM said that despite a gap of 30 days in the monsoon, the water requirement in that period was met through various structures created through Jalyukt Shivar scheme. He also assured that with required intervention from government agencies, Vidarbha will produce enough milk.Earlier, Gadkari announced that this year onwards Agro-Vision will be permanently providing guidance to farmers through workshops and interactions.

It has also affected small traders , who sell the puja material. Ayyappa Deeksha begins on November 15 in the state and concludes on Sankranti in mid-January next year.Over 300 big and small shops in Hyderabad and Secunderabad did not report any business in the last three days thanks to the withdrawal of old 500 and 1,000 notes. These shops exclusively deal in puja material and other requirements of devotees.This is the season for the Mandali Deeksha (41-day vow). But the sudden move to tackle black money has forced many to put off plans till the situation improves. Ayyappa devotees invariably wear black clothes and follow a rigid system with special pujas.Taking Deeksha is an elaborate process. As many as 23 puja items including turmeric powder, sandalwood paste or powder, Kalasa vastram, sugar candy (kalakanda) and black cloth are needed. The cost of these material is about 2,000.Traders in twin cities bring puja material all the way from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. ""We have already brought stocks, but there are no buyers. Given the present situation, we will not get business for at least one more week. Normally, we get many customers during the Kartika month. We have not even received bulk orders from nearby villages,"" said Ch Ramanchandra, a shop owner in General Bazar.Vasu, who owns a chain of shops, said though the Deeksha begins on November 15 devotees start purchasing material a week before. ""Not all shops accept credit cards. Also, not everyone does have credit or debit cards,"" he said.Eswar Rao, a devotee, said he had planned to take the Deeksha on November 15 but had decided to defer plans. ""I have no money left. I cannot withdraw money from ATMs. There are long queues outside banks. It is better to postpone the Deeksha ceremony by a few days,"" he said.The attendance at Ayyappa temples has also been low. Many temples have stopped accepting old notes as offering. K Haridas, vice-president of Lal Bazar Ayyappa Devasthanam, hoped that more devotees will visit the temples once the situation improves. ""We are not accepting the demonetised notes from Ayyappa devotees,"" he curtly told TOI.G Kumaran Nair, manager of Ayyappa Devasthanam, Mettuguda, urged devotees to donate 100 notes."

MAIIL is planning to set up fuel stations or bio-CNG dispensing units in the city in about 8-9 months. The fuel will be produced from molasses and will be carried in cascades to the fuel stations unlike other CNG which is transported through pipeline.Manish Umale, general manager of MAIIL, told TOI that the bio-CNG would cost Rs40-45 /kg and a scooter can run 65km in one kg. ""This is very cheap compared to the conventional petrol or diesel which cause pollution to different extents. Bio-CNG is environment-friendly and the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) has given nod to use biogas as fuel,"" said Umale.The idea for bio-CNG came from Spectrum Renewable Energy Pvt Ltd of Hyderabad which is testing the use of this new fuel in commercial vehicles. Bio-CNG is being produced at Warna Nagar near Kolhapur.Detailing the process of bio-CNG production, Umale said molasses generated while manufacturing sugar is mixed with rectified spirit and ethanol which forms a sludge. This sludge is used to produce methane which is then purified and filled in cascades at high pressure. In the process, some sludge remains which can be used as fertilizer. ""We would be transporting the sludge from our Bela plant to city in cascades which will be installed in our fuel stations. Users can fill bio-CNG in vehicles from these outlets which are expected to be ready in less than a year,"" said Umale.Considering the benefits, government needs to make changes in rules and infrastructure so as to allow use of bio-CNG as fuel. The government should allow converting existing vehicles like scooters or three wheelers into CNG-friendly vehicles by attaching a conversion kit in it. Old vehicles too can be permitted to be converted into bio-CNG vehicles.

The project is part of 'Water 4 Crops', an Indo-European collaborative project executed as twin projects, 'Water 4 Crops-EU' and 'Water 4 Crops-India'.As one of the 14 consortium partners of India, MSSRF has designed low-cost technologies for treating wastewater from sugar and distillery units of KCP Sugar and Industrial Co-operation Ltd in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. After discovering that wastewater from effluent treatment plants in the KCP sugar unit contained toxins beyond permissible limit for use in aqua and agro farming, MSSRF began the project in 2013. Since 2014, sugarcane farmers have been using water from the bio-treatment plant for irrigation.Effluents released from the primary treatment plants in the sugar unit are pumped into a filtration tank which removes coarse materials and conveys it through gravity to a wetland system. The wetland is filled with gravel and vegetation including typha, an emergent macrophite, apart from duck weed and algae that grow naturally in the environment. It contains five chambers with water flowing from one to another in an alternating flow of vertical and horizontal movement.The resultant water is passed into a storage tank where UV radiations from sunlight kill pathogens that may be left. The biotreated water is finally sent to a fish pond. The pond also acts as a culturing medium, enriching the water through the nitrogen cycle so that it can be used for irrigation.Principal scientist at MSSRF Dr J D Sophia says, ""Sugarcane farmers have reported better yields due to use of water from the biotreatment method compared to water from the conventional treatment methods."" Dr Sophia, who perfected the treatment process to reuse effluents, says the reuse of biotreated wastewater increases water availability and productivity in an eco-friendly manner with significant savings,"" she says."

It brings with it several complications and secondary diseases, which results from uncontrolled and untreated diabetes. Therefore, on the occasion of World Diabetes Day (November 14), this year's theme 'Eye on Diabetes' focusses on feasible and cost-effective solutions to avoid risks of costly complications of Type 2 diabetes.The most common yet serious complications of Type 2 diabetes includes micro vascular complications such as development of diabetic retinopathy, a non-reversible progressive vision loss, diabetic neuropathy (tingling, burning sensation in the nerves progressing to numbness and total loss of sensation, bacterial infections in the wound and diabetic foot (where amputation is often resorted to as the blood flow to the vessels is affected). Besides, macro vascular complications such as cardiac arrest, brain stroke, kidney disease progressing to end-stage renal failure and urinary tract infections are also common. Diabetic patients have higher chances of development of heart attack at least five years earlier than a normal person.However, all these can be avoided by following a prudent approach to the disorder and modifying its course through early diagnosis, regular check-ups and thus reducing the risk of complications and other health threats.Nowadays, with Type 2 diabetics being detected at a younger age (in patients in their 30s and 40s), it's extremely important to follow a judicious approach towards controlling diabetes and getting screened at an early age.Dr Triveni Reddy , internal medicine expert at Care Hospital , said, ""First of all, people must be cautious about the warning symptoms of diabetes and not confuse them with general illnesses. Especially if the person if above 30 years of age, obese, or got a family history of diabetes where any family member, parents or sibling already had diabetes, or if the person had gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, then they should get screened for diabetes, every year. The mild symptoms include tiredness, increased urination, high thirst, losing weight despite high appetite and eating. Daily, we see at least four-five new patients. Sometimes, patients also turn up in a state of diabetes coma or extreme drowsiness when the sugar level reaches more than 400.""Once diabetes is detected, one must undergo blood sugar checking every three months and keep the sugar level under control. Checking of the other organs such as eyes, kidneys, heart should be done annually to minimise the development or progress of complications associated with diabetes. For this, drugs, diet and exercise are the three keys to modify the course of diabetes and fluctuating sugar level and keeping the complications away, aver doctors. ""From time to time, after consultation with one's physician, drugs can be changed or doses modified, stress level should be kept in check, undertake at least 30 kilometres of brisk walking five days a week. As for diet, smoking and alcohol should be a total no-no, diet should be low in calories, high in fibre and protein, avoid sugar and sweet rich food and certain fruits as well as too much rice especially at night. Follow the diet chart as prescribed by dietician or doctor,"" added Dr Reddy."

The provision of 15% interest is mentioned in the Sugar Cane Control Act, 1966, as well as the UP Sugarcane (supply and purchase) Act, 1953.Cane commissioner Vipin Kumar Dwivedi said that against total dues of Rs 1873.82 crore in the ongoing cane crushing season, payment of Rs 1507.56 crore has been made, which is about 80% of the total dues to be paid to the farmers.According to the department, the mills in the cooperative sector have made 100% payment, but the private mills are defaulting -- having cleared only about 78% of the total dues. The gap is significant because private millers dominate the sugar sector in UP. The cane development department said that 114 private mills are operating in the ongoing crushing season. Till December 8, officials said, 1363.38 lakh quintal cane was subjected to crushing. This was almost 2.5 times compared to the same period last year when 505.38 quintal cane was crushed to produce sugar.The department also claimed that the sugar recovery has risen to 9.85% as compared to 9.7% last year. Dwivedi said this was primarily because of adoption of high yield variety of cane adopted by the cane growers."

The India coach was more vocal, saying its like making a mountain out of a mole hill.India v England: English media invades Mohali pitchFirst of all, I dont want to react to any report in the media. As far as I am concerned, umpires as well as the match referee never ever came to us talking about it. For someone like Faf du Plessis --- South Africa played exceptional cricket to beat Australia, to be told about ball tampering is silly. There is nothing to worry about, people can allege and write whatever they want. As far as we are concerned, none of our players were part of it, said Kumble.The controversy started when video footage of Kohli from the first Test in Rajkot emerged. It showed the India skipper rubbing his fingers in the mouth and seemed to shine one side of the ball. It came close to Du Plessis controversy, wherein the South Africa skipper was docked his match fee for ball tampering in the Hobart Test.In Kohlis case, no inquiry will be initiated as the mandatory five-day window for investigation had passed by the time the footage emerged.Woakes also did not comment on the issue but demanded clarity from the ICC.I think they have said that everyone tries to shine the ball in this fashion. The fact that Faf du Plessis has been fined by the ICC and the South Africans trying to make stands on that, but there is grey area to this. Hashim Amla has said about him chewing gum in his mouth whole day. I am not sure if it is deemed wrong.During drink breaks we would take a mint or any sweet to re-energise. But nothing from that is allowed or supposed to go on the ball. Sometimes we take an energy drink like Gatarode and then shine the ball by perhaps licking it, I am not sure how much sugar we carry in the mouth, it is a grey area, he said."

A Lok Mangal staffer in the car said the cash belonged to the Lok Mangal bank. Deshmukh said it was meant for payment to workers in a sugar factory affiliated to the Lok Mangal group.The vehicle has been impounded in Umarga tehsil in Osmanabad district, while the cash has been deposited in the local treasury.""We have sought clarification from the group. In addition, we have informed the income tax department and the local police. If the group justifies the cash, it will be returned. Else, legal action will be taken as per the provisions of law,'' Narnaware said.Subhash Deshmukh did not respond to a TOI sms. The Sharad Pawar-led NCP and Congress were quick to demand immediate dismissal of the controversial minister for black money transactions. In the past, Lok Mangal was under the scanner of Sebi for irregularities in mobilising funds for the group.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said, ""We feel that maximum black money is stocked in the houses of BJP leaders. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis should sack Deshmukh immediately and the income tax department must search the official and residential premises of leading BJP politicians.""Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant echoed the NCP's demand and said the IT department should probe into the transactions of all BJP leaders during the last six months. ""It is well known that Modi's decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was leaked selectively to senior BJP leaders and leading industrial houses. Deshmukh is not the first BJP politician; last week too, a huge amount was found in a vehicle belonging to a BJP leader,'' Sawant said."

The fraud was initially estimated at around Rs 22 crore, but the police believe it may go up to Rs 50 crore.Principally, sugar was exported in 2007-08 at rates lower than market prices, but the transport company was paid at rates higher than that prevalent at the time. Around 200 accused have been listed, including the chairmen, managing directors and directors of the 21 factories in Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Pune.An advocate, Govind Patil, had filed the case with the police. ""The modus operandi was that over two lakh tonnes of sugar were sold to Kenya, Tanzania and Sri Lanka at a much lower price than the market rate in India. Moreover, the transportation fees given to M/s Shakti Credit Limited were much higher than market rates. During our initial probe, we found that it was the transporter's firm that had brought the proposal of export and the remaining work was done with its help,"" said a police officer.A Kolhapur resident, Vasant Apte, had filed a petition in the Bombay high court in 2008 seeking a probe. The HC directed the Sugar Committee to inquire. During its second inquiry, sugar commissioner Raj Gopal Deora found a loss of crores and the court ordered Mumbai police to probe. ""After a preliminary inquiry, we registered a cheating case in August 2016 against the chairman, managing directors, directors and office bearers of M/s Shakti Credit. We have written to all the sugar factories to furnish records of all exports during 2007-08 and are waiting for their reply. We have also made an office bearer of the Maharashtra Sugar Federation an accused,"" added the officer.The sleuths said they are trying to track how Shakti Credit got the tenders for the exports, mainly through JNPT, Kandla and Port Bundar ports. The role of some officers of the Indian Sugar Export-Import Pvt Ltd is under probe."

Several bank employees have also been spending stressful days and sleepless nights.""We have been working an average of 12 to 14 hours a day. On the first two-three days, several of our women staff members stayed back till around midnight to complete work, despite having begin their days early,"" said Rakesh Singh, branch manager of IDBI Bank in Satellite.Stress and anxiety are the order of the day for bank employees who are surrounded by distressed and angry customers. ""We are trying our best to help customers, make them comfortable and ensure a smooth change. Sometimes there is a cash shortage and we have to temporarily suspend exchanges and withdrawals. We are helpless, but customers are so distressed that they often create a ruckus or scream at us. This has been our daily ordeal,"" said an employee of Oriental Bank of Commerce at Bodakdev.Most banks attend to not more than 100 customers on a normal day. Against this, estimates by banks suggest that an average of 1,000 customers have been lining up outside branches and the situation has worsened since ATMs are running out of cash very often. Further explaining the situation, Janak Rawal, general secretary, Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association (MGBEA), said, ""Most have sore throats and are barely able to speak as they are forced to talk louder amid the noise and chaos. Moreover, most employees are sleep deprived and extremely overworked. In fact, one bank manager in Nadiad district met with an accident while driving because of this extreme pressure."" Many bank employees, especially managers of the respective banks are older than 50 years and also suffer from high sugar levels and hypertension, which gets aggravated with stress. What makes matter worse is the heavy cash inflow, which has to be tallied at the end of the day.""A discrepancy in tallying cash is the worst nightmare of a banker and handling such huge volumes of cash has made them go berserk, as discrepancies tend to creep in. This leaves them in extreme anxiety and several of them get anxiety attacks,"" added Rawal."

They said fishermen and farmers have planted crops on the encroached land in the backwaters and nothing has been done to stop them.Forest minister Sudheer Mungantiwar, who inaugurated the bird festival, stressed the need to preserve the bird habitat. The government has taken an initiative to plant two crore saplings in the state, which will help preserve wildlife, he said.""The festival will help increase the number of bird lovers. Birds from across the world come to the sanctuary. It is our responsibility to preserve forests and the eco system,"" he said.The minister, accompanied by state assembly speaker Haribhau Bagade and divisional commissioner Umakant Dangat , also watched birds in the Jayakwadi reservoir.The forest authorities and the Environmental Research Foundation and Educational Academy, an NGO, would extend guidance during the festival, said forest officials.""About 270 species of migratory birds make it to the Jayakwadi reservoir, which was declared a bird sanctuary by the state government in 1986,"" said Kamlakar Dhamge, the divisional forest officer (wild life).The dam, situated 1 km from Paithan town, was constructed to overcome irrigation and drinking water scarcity in the drought-prone region of Marathwada. It is 55 km in length and 27 km in width. This gives the reservoir a typical shallow wetland character, which makes penetration of sunlight up up to the bottom easy.Noted environmentalist Kishor Pathak said the use of loudspeakers and hectic activity disturbs the birds and that the such an even at the sanctuary should have been avoided.""The officials should instead focus on increasing vigil in the area to ensure protection of birds from poachers and some farmers who have encroached upon the space in the backwaters and have planted different crops,"" he said.""We are not against the bird festival, but certain care has to be taken. The authorities should clear at least a 2 km stretch at the dam to save the birds,"" said Pathak."

Many have been forced to stop work.These labourers, who work in farms mostly in western Maharashtra and Marathwada, are usually paid in cash. Now, with the dearth of notes, their payments have been delayed.The demonetisation impact is pinching further in parts of the rural economy around the cane-cutting season because district cooperative banks have been banned from exchanging and depositing high-value notes.The sugarcane crushing season started from November 5 and is expected to go on for five months. On an average, a labourer makes between Rs 350 and Rs 500 a day and is paid every 15 days by the sugar factory to which the cane is made available. ""Generally, the sugar factory pays the mukadam (supervisor), who in turn distributes it to the labourers, usually in cash. The first installment of payment still hasn't been given in many areas,"" said Ghanininath Thore, chairman of the union of these labourers.Since most of the labourers are debt-ridden, the delay in payment would almost amount to a crisis, he added. They are already facing pressure because this year, the area under sugarcane has significantly reduced due to the few years of drought.Experts say that if the situation remains unchanged, it will have a largescale impact on the sugar industry. Since it is just the beginning of the season, factory managements have been able to convince the labourers to stay on the farms and helped them get food and daily essentials on credit.""Payment to these daily-wage labourers has been a major issue. Since it is only the beginning and most of them have taken some advance before beginning work, the situation is under control. But if in a few days there is no solution, it could lead to work stopping in many farms, impacting sugar production,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. Since the co-operative banks haven't been allowed to do any transaction, farmers too aren't being paid, he added.Maharashtra is one of the largest sugar-producing states. Over 7 lakh rural poor migrate to Beed, Solapur, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts every year to cut sugarcane. Some of them have their own farms, but do the work for additional income.When TOI spoke to a few labourers, they said their daily needs like food were being affected for lack of adequate cash. Also the loans they have from their own farms too would be affected.Sadanand Shinde and his wife have travelled 450 km from their village in Jalgaon to work in a farm in Baramati. ""We haven't been paid since we started work earlier this month. The advance that we had taken from the mukadam was given to us in Rs 500 notes that we cannot exchange as the nearest bank is about 5km from the farm and queueing up would mean loss of pay for those hours,"" said Shinde."

Both the bride and groom are engineers, with Ambika also holding an MTech degree.Sources close to the Jarkiholi family said Ambika's family is related to Satish Jarkiholi 's wife. Another common ground is that Ambika is from Manvi, the taluk where the Jarkiholis' sister has settled down after marriage.While the wedding may be incomparable to the Reddys' big-ticket filmi bash, it is said Gokak will be lit up for the festivities. This will be the first grandiose wedding in the powerful Jarikiholi family, comprising five brothers. Ramesh, the eldest, and former minister Satish are Congress legislators, while Balachandra Jarkiholi is a BJP member and was also a minister in the previous government. While Bhimsi Jarkiholi made an unsuccessful bid to enter politics on the BJP ticket, Lakkan has stayed away from it. It is said that barring Bhimsi, who was defeated by Satish in the last election, the other four brothers have come together for the wedding.

The stage and catering services have been hired from Bengaluru.
