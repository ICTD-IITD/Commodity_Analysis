In November 2015, the print was (-)2.04 per cent.WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)24.10 per cent in November, saw deflationary pressure for the third consecutive month. This was helped by a substantial price fall in onions, which stood at (-)51.51 per cent.Pulse inflation continued to rule high at 21.73 per cent in November, according to commerce ministry data.Potato recorded maximum inflationary pressure at 36.97 per cent. Inflation in fruits rose to 2.45 per cent during the month.Overall, the food inflation basket showed moderation with inflation at 1.54 per cent in November as against 4.34 per cent in October.The reading for manufactured articles was 3.20 per cent compared with 2.67 per cent in the previous month. The corresponding figure for sugar came in at 31.76 per cent and that of petrol 5.54 per cent.The WPI inflation for September has been revised upwards at 3.8 per cent against the provisional estimate of 3.57 per cent.The decline in wholesale inflation coincides with a fall in retail inflation, which hit a two-year low of 3.63 per cent in November.The monetary policy committee headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel had earlier this month held interest rates steady and said demonetisation of high value currency notes could lower prices of perishables and reduce CPI inflation by 10-15 basis points by December.Even as RBI maintained 5 per cent inflation target for March 2017, it trimmed GDP growth forecast to 7.1 per cent, from 7.6 per cent, for the current fiscal."

The transplant in Pune could be the seventh or the eighth one in the country, doctors said.The donor, a 16-year-old boy who met with a road accident on November 4 and was declared brain dead the next day, gave his liver, kidneys and pancreas that helped save the lives of four persons. The liver has been successfully transplanted into a 60-year-old man suffering from end-stage liver disease for the last four years.During the pancreas-kidney transplant , doctors did not have to remove any diseased organs from the recipient's body. They placed the new kidney on the lower left side of the abdomen and connected it to nearby blood vessels and the intestines. The ureter was attached to the bladder. On the lower right side of abdomen, the pancreas was connected to blood vessels and the intestines so that secreted insulin is passed in the intestines for metabolism.""The recipient has two pancreas and three kidneys in his body. It is an established and evidence-based practice where doctors do not remove the diseased organs (like damaged pancreas and a kidney in the man's case) and instead create a new place in the body for the donated healthy organs and have a new connection for them to function normally,"" multi-organ transplant surgeon Vrishali Patil said.She added that the patient was recovering and his diabetes has been reversed and would be discharged in a day or two.Patil carried out the transplant at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital on November 6. ""Post surgery, the man's condition is completely stable. All his deteriorating parameters are within healthy ranges. His blood sugar level is absolutely normal but he has been allowed to eat sweets only in moderation,"" she added.""I am gorging on sweets now and feel relived. The surgery has restored my confidence and given me a new lease of life,"" the man diagnosed with type I diabetes when he was just 10 years old said.His condition had deteriorated in the last five years. ""The man's kidneys had started failing after years of diabetes. He was on periodic dialysis treatment. The unstable and uncontrolled diabetes could either drastically drop or spike dangerously at the slightest variation of insulin doses. He has been lately diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy. Besides, functioning of his heart had also taken a beating. He was losing his nerve sensation. The transplant has simply given him a new lease of life,"" Patil added.Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital got the licence for the pancreas transplant five months ago. ""We have been waiting for a fitting donor since then. Our first attempt failed three months ago when a brain dead patient's family consented to donate his pancreas along with other vital organs. But upon examination, our doctors found that his pancreas was unfit for transplant as its vital function of insulin secretion had failed. Currently, we have five more patients enrolled for pancreas transplant. Our is the only certified pancreas transplant unit in Maharashtra,"" cancer surgeon Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of DMH, said.Besides Patil, the pancreas transplant team at DMH comprises certified multi-organ transplant surgeon Ninad Deshmukh, transplant physicians Sachin Palnitkar and Vishnu Biradar, transplant nephrologists Atul Mulay and Tushar Dighe and transplant intensivist Prasad Akole."

The mill will now be leased to the private sector on a long-term basis. The cabinet has also decided to set up an integrated sugar complex at Majhola instead of renovating a single sugar mill.Earlier, a proposal to lease the mill was unanimously passed by the annual general meeting of the sugar mill on November 7 and sent it to the state government for approval. The mill was established in 1963 in the cooperative sector and was closed in 2010-11 as its plant and machinery had become obsolete.Giving information to TOI on phone, minister of fishery and public enterprise in government of UP Riaz Ahmad said he had pressed the cabinet meeting for taking up the proposal by Majhola mill AGM into consideration for approval.The cabinet took cognizance of a detailed proposal for an integrated sugar complex at Majhola sugar mill campus instead of ""reconditioning"" a single sugar-manufacturing unit. The integrated sugar complex is a cluster comprising the sugar mill, a distillery unit to manufacture liquor from molasses and a cogeneration plant to produce electricity from baggasse.The renovation of the existing mill as well as the integrated sugar complex envisaged an investment of Rs 220 crore. The need for a huge investment was one of the reasons why the cabinet favoured leasing the mill to the private sector, Ahmad said.The cabinet also focused on the direct and indirect benefits to cane growers as well as to trade and business in the area concerned by establishing an integrated sugar complex.Asked when work on the project would commence, district magistrate Masoom Ali Sarvar said he had been informed about the cabinet's approval but was yet to receive the documents concerned. He said the notification for assembly elections was expected to be issued soon in UP and, therefore, further issues regarding giving a practical shape to the approved project would inevitably be subject to the decisions taken by the Election Commission in this regard."

Though the state government was willing to foot the bill for overhauling all the machinery in the factories and hand them over to farmers, they (farmers) were not coming forward to form a cooperative to run the units, the chief minister said.Speaking in the legislative assembly during a discussion on agriculture, KCR said NSF units should be run by a farmers' society as in Maharashtra and if the farmers were ready to do so, the government was ready to settle the payments to the private operator and take over the sugar plants. He asked Congress leader K Jeevan Reddy to take lead on this issue.""For running the factory, about 10 lakh tonnes of sugarcane is required for crushing every season. But sugarcane growing has come down in the state and 95% of farmers in Bodhan have shifted to alternative crops,"" he said. He also recalled that he was the one who fought for farmers dependent on NSF and demanded that the factories should not be privatized. But due to various reasons, the factories were now locked out. The CM said as part of the effort to educate farmers on the possibility of forming a cooperative and running the NSF units, about 400 farmers were taken to Maharashtra to see how the farmers' societies there were running profitable sugar factories.On the issue of farm loan waiver scheme, Chandrasekhar Rao said the government would release the fourth and final instalment of loan waiver amount as per schedule next year. He said the government had always maintained that the loan waiver amounts would be released to the banks in four instalments. ""The government waived 16,500 crore in bank loans benefiting about 35 lakh farmers. If there are farmers facing problems with bankers, MLAs can bring these to the notice of finance and agriculture ministers who will sort out the issues,"" he said. He declared that the government would bear additional 100 crore to 200 crore towards interest on loans due from farmers to banks.With the state government not relenting for immediate payment of the fourth instalment to banks, the Congress walked out of the House in protest.Earlier, Congress leaders K Jana Reddy and N Uttam Kumar Reddy brought the plight of farmers in the state to the notice of the government. Uttam said agriculture produce, cultivation and even loans from banks came down in the past two years after TRS came to power."

The tests revealed high rate of obesity and other weight-related complications among the state's decision-makers. Fifty-three of the 55 legislators, from across party lines, and over 170 babus were found to be obese.CM Devendra Fadnavis had organised the check-ups at the Nagpur Vidhan Bhavan with the help of Pune-based bariatric surgeon Jayashree Todkar , who has been guiding him in his personal fight against fat and flab.In just a year, Fadnavis has shed 26 kilos and he is determined to help others in the state machinery and power circles to get in shape.""When the chief minister started the treatment, he weighed 122 kg. However, he followed adisciplined routine and now has to lose only 8 to 10 kg to reach his target weight. He is otherwise healthy so it won't be a Herculean task,"" said Todkar, whose foundation has joined the government's drive against obesity.In all, the organisation screen 512 people during the winter session. More than half had a problem with their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of obesity.""Of the 512 people surveyed, 173 were in the obese category, (BMI over 30) and 151 in the overweight category (BMI 25-30),"" Todkar said. ""We also checked for sugar and of the 100 people who came forth, 22 people had sugar higher than 150. This number is very high in the sample size of 100. In fact, eight people among those screened for sugar had no idea that they were even diabetic. I am glad the CM has worked towards his improvement and has shared the urgency of self-care with others.""MLAs and bureaucrats whose health is in the red will have another session with the doctor to decide the course of treatment, said Girish Mahajan, minister for medical education, water resources and command area development.""If the state has to fight the problem of obesity, we should start from the government and set an example. We are also conducting awareness campaigns at government colleges. This includes surveys for patients, their relatives and employees working there,"" he said,Pravin Pote, minister for industries, mining and public works, said most politicians faced weight problems because of their exhausting routine. ""We eat at irregular times and suffer from high sugar levels and blood pressure. To spread awareness about health, we have to first take care of ourselves,"" he said.Experts say obesity often leads to many other complications. ""It's about time obesity was looked upon as a disease rather than a cosmetic problem,"" said Dr Todkar, stressing on the importance of timely treatment.""A patient of mine had been putting off treatment for a while. Finally, when he was on the way to my clinic, he found it difficult to breathe and was advised immediate hospitalisation. With treatment, his condition improved, but the liver could not cope and he died of liver failure. Had he started treatment even a week before, he could have been saved."""

Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 26, 2016April 2016 communist party congress +HAVANA: Former President Fidel Castro , who led a rebel army to improbable victory in Cuba , embraced Soviet-style communism and defied the power of 10 US presidents during his half century rule, has died at age 90.Castro's reign over the island-nation 90 miles from Florida was marked by the US-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis a year later that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. The, who survived a crippling US trade embargo as well as dozens, possibly hundreds, of assassination plots, died eight years after ill health forced him to formally hand power over to his younger brother Raul, who announced his death late Friday on state television.Castro overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, exile in Mexico and a disastrous start to his rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana in January 1959 to become, at age 32, the youngest leader in Latin America. For decades, he served as an inspiration and source of support to revolutionaries from Latin America to Africa.His commitment to socialism was unwavering, though his power finally began to fade in mid-2006 when a gastrointestinal ailment forced him to hand over the presidency to Raul in 2008, provisionally at first and then permanently. His defiant image lingered long after he gave up his trademark Cohiba cigars for health reasons and his tall frame grew stooped.""Socialism or death"" remained Castro's rallying cry even as Western-style democracy swept the globe and other communist regimes in China and Vietnam embraced capitalism, leaving this island of 11 million people an economically crippled Marxist curiosity.He survived long enough to see Raul Castro negotiate an opening with US President Barack Obama on December 17, 2014, when Washington and Havana announced they would move to restore diplomatic ties for the first time since they were severed in 1961. He cautiously blessed the historic deal with his lifelong enemy in a letter published after a month-long silence.Fidel Castro Ruz was born Aug. 13, 1926, in eastern Cuba's sugar country, where his Spanish immigrant father worked first recruiting labor for US sugar companies and later built up a prosperous plantation of his own.Castro attended Jesuit schools, then the University of Havana, where he received law and social science degrees. His life as a rebel began in 1953 with a reckless attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago. Most of his comrades were killed and Fidel and his brother Raul went to prison.Fidel turned his trial defense into a manifesto that he smuggled out of jail,Freed under a pardon, Castro fled to Mexico and organized a rebel band that returned in 1956, sailing across the Gulf of Mexico to Cuba on a yacht named Granma. After losing most of his group in a bungled landing, he rallied support in Cuba's eastern Sierra Maestra mountains.Three years later, tens of thousands spilled into the streets of Havana to celebrate Batista's downfall and catch a glimpse of Castro as his rebel caravan arrived in the capital on Jan. 8, 1959.The US was among the first to formally recognize his government, cautiously trusting Castro's early assurances he merely wanted to restore democracy, not install socialism.Within months, Castro was imposing radical economic reforms. Members of the old government went before summary courts, and at least 582 were shot by firing squads over two years. Independent newspapers were closed and in the early years, homosexuals were herded into camps for ""re-education.""In 1964, Castro acknowledged holding 15,000 political prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled, including Castro's daughter Alina Fernandez Revuelta and his younger sister Juana.Still, the revolution thrilled millions in Cuba and across Latin America who saw it as an example of how the seemingly arrogant Yankees could be defied. And many on the island were happy to see the seizure of property of the landed class, the expulsion of American gangsters and the closure of their casinos.Castro's speeches, lasting up to six hours, became the soundtrack of Cuban life and his 269-minute speech to the UN General Assembly in 1960 set the world body's record for length that still stood more than five decades later.As Castro moved into the Soviet bloc, Washington began working to oust him, cutting US purchases of sugar, the island's economic mainstay. Castro, in turn, confiscated $1 billion in US assets.The American government imposed a trade embargo, banning virtually all US exports to the island except for food and medicine, and it severed diplomatic ties on Jan. 3, 1961.On April 16 of that year, Castro declared his revolution to be socialist, and the next day, about 1,400 Cuban exiles stormed the beach at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast. But the CIA-backed invasion failed.The debacle forced the US to give up on the idea of invading Cuba, but that didn't stop Washington and Castro's exiled enemies from trying to do him in. By Cuban count, he was the target of more than 630 assassination plots by militant Cuban exiles or the US government.The biggest crisis of the Cold War between Washington and Moscow exploded on Oct. 22, 1962, when President John F. Kennedy announced there were Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba and imposed a naval blockade of the island. Humankind held its breath, and after a tense week of diplomacy, Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev removed them. Never had the world felt so close to nuclear war.Castro cobbled revolutionary groups together into the new Cuban Communist Party, with him as first secretary. Labor unions lost the right to strike. The Catholic Church and other religious institutions were harassed. Neighborhood ""revolutionary defense committees"" kept an eye on everyone.Castro exported revolution to Latin American countries in the 1960s, and dispatched Cuban troops to Africa to fight Western-backed regimes in the 1970s. Over the decades, he sent Cuban doctors abroad to tend to the poor, and gave sanctuary to fugitive Black Panther leaders from the USBut the collapse of the Soviet bloc ended billions in preferential trade and subsidies for Cuba, sending its economy into a tailspin. Castro briefly experimented with an opening to foreign capitalists and limited private enterprise.As the end of the Cold War eased global tensions, many Latin American and European countries re-established relations with Cuba. In January 1998, Pope John Paul II visited a nation that had been officially atheist until the early 1990s.Aided by a tourism boom, the economy slowly recovered and Castro steadily reasserted government control, stifling much of the limited free enterprise tolerated during harder times.As flamboyant as he was in public, Castro tried to lead a discreet private life. He and his first wife, Mirta Diaz Balart, had one son before divorcing in 1956. Then, for more than four decades, Castro had a relationship with Dalia Soto del Valle. They had five sons together and were said to have married quietly in 1980.By the time Castro resigned 49 years after his triumphant arrival in Havana, he was the world's longest ruling head of government, aside from monarchs.In retirement, Castro voiced unwavering support as Raul slowly but deliberately enacted sweeping changes to the Marxist system he had built.His longevity allowed the younger brother to consolidate control, perhaps lengthening the revolution well past both men's lives. In February 2013, Raul announced that he would retire as president in 2018 and named newly minted Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel as his successor.""I'll be 90 years old soon,"" Castro said at anwhere he made his most extensive public appearance in years. ""Soon I'll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban Communists will remain as proof that on this planet, if one works with fervor and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need and that need to be fought for without ever giving up."""

A Cuban icon Fidel Castro Ruz was the President of Cuba from 1976 to 2008, and was the world's third longest-serving head of state, after Britain's Queen Elizabeth and the King of Thailand. He temporarily ceded power to his brother Raul in July 2006 after undergoing intestinal surgery, and officially handed over power in 2008. By the time he stepped down during George W Bush's presidency, he had outlasted nine U.S. presidents.Time Magazine in 2012 named Castro as one of the 100 most influential personalities of all time.2. Birth, education and personal life Castro was born on August 13, 1926, in eastern Cuba's sugar country. He went to Jesuit schools, and graduated from the University of Havana with law and social science degrees. He had nine children from five women.3. Beginnings Castro participated in an rebel attack on the Moncada military barracks in Santiago in 1953. He was jailed along with his brother Raul, but freed later on a pardon. He fled to Mexico, and returned in 1956. In 1959, Castro - then just 32 - overthrew the US-backed government of Fulgencio Batista.4. A man both revered and hated One of the giant figures of modern history, Castro is both loved as a hero and hated as a dictator. He has been accused by human rights groups of brutally repressing dissent by torturing and jailing opponents.5. Radical reforms Within months of taking over, Castro, who had promised to restore democracy in his country (as opposed to making it a socialist state) began imposing radical reforms. At least 583 members of the previous government were shot by firing squads, independent newspapers were shut down, and homosexuals were sent to camps for ""re-education."" In 1964, Castro admitted that he was holding 15,000 political prisoners.6. Cuba-US relations sour Cuba later moved into the Soviet bloc, and the US cut its purchases of sugar (Cuba's major export) from its island neighbour. Castro responded by confiscating $1 billion in US assets, and the US then banned all exports to Cuba except for food and medicine, and severed diplomatic ties with Havana in 1961.7. The Bay of Pigs invasion On April 17, 1961, a day after Castro declared that his revolution was socialist, around 1,400 Cuban exiles - backed by the US' Central Intelligence Agency - stormed the beach at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast. The invasion failed.8. The Cuban missile crisis A year later, the then-US President John F Kennedy imposed a naval blockade on Cuba, after announcing that there were Soviet nuclear missiles there. It was the closest the US and Russia came to nuclear war during the Cold War, but Soviet leader Nikita Kruschev eventually removed the missiles.9. A new Cuba Today's Cuba and Castro's Cuba are very different places. Cuba's current President, Raul Castro, has restored diplomatic relations with the US, and US President Barack Obama made a historic visit to Cuba in March this year10. 634 alleged assassination attempts Castro claimed he survived 634 attempts or plots to assassinate him, mainly masterminded by the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S.-based exile organizations. They may have included poison pills, a toxic cigar, exploding mollusks, and a chemically tainted diving suit. Another alleged plan involved giving him powder that would make his beard fall out and so undermine his popularity."

But are unable to get many buyers.The core of sought Gujarat's rural economy is Surat District Cooperative Bank (SDCB) in Surat and Tapi districts which has deposits of over Rs 5,000 crore. But with the demonetisation scheme in force, the banks are unable to used the deposits to ease the agony of their member farmers.SDCB has collected about Rs 350 crore in demonetized notes over the last two weeks. There are 1,100 milk cooperatives with 2.33 lakh accounts, nine sugar factories with over 1.25 lakh accounts, 25,000 accounts of service cooperatives and another 40,000 accounts of 405 other mandalis.Naresh Patel, SDCB chairman said, ""If the situation continues, we will have to close down for the first time in 100 years.

Unlike previous years, the plan for Christmas celebration has shrunk to a meal together with family members. Even with available discounts, I bought the only the much-needed food items,"" said Priyanka PS, a resident of Mudavanmugal.With only days left for Christmas and New Year, the special sales at Supplyco and Consumerfed which offer attractive discounts on provision goods are seen packed with crowd who maintain a minimal list of essentials. According to the officials at Supplyco and Consumerfed, the number of people visiting the stores has not decreased but there is considerable dip in demand.""We recorded a sale of Rs6.56 lakh on Wednesday, which was the highest since the fair began.

However, the revenue generated between November 1-18 this year was Rs 533 crore, as against Rs 494 crore in the same period last year, which could partially be attributed to an increase in the sales of country liquor.The sale of country liquor in rural areas has seen a 5-8% increase. While IMFL is mainly consumed in urban areas, demonetisation has also hit rural areas but liquor there is easily available on credit.The increase in sales of country liquor is on account of several reasons. The state government's new toddy policy came into force last month, under which no licence will be issued if the toddy seller can't show the tree which is the source of toddy. In Mumbai, all the 230 toddy shops have been shut down as there is not a single such tree in the city. Toddy is a perishable item and has a shelf life of six to seven hours, so it has to be manufactured locally. In most places, a chemical was used to make a concoction which was sold as toddy. ""We wanted to stop such illicit sale and our new policy has shut 600 of the 1,200 toddy shops. We also declared a total bandh on toddy shops for a month. Those consuming toddy have moved to country liquor as it costs nearly the same,"" said V Radha , state excise commissioner.Some of those unable to afford IMFL have also moved to country liquor. Further, better policing in rural areas has meant illicit breweries are unable to operate. Radha, who took over in September this year, put in place a control room at the state excise headquarters where citizens can complain about illicit breweries, distilleries and other violations. Excise flying squads too are being monitored through GPS to ensure they act on complaints. Complaining to the control room ensures anonymity to complainants.All this has meant those consuming illicit liquor have also turned to country liquor. In the last three months, the state's excise revenue has increased. In Thane, where the revenue was -12%, it has now jumped to +12%. A similar increase has been seen for other districts.Tracking of vehicles leaving distilleries with rectified spirit and sugar factories with molasses has also ensured there are no diversions for illegal manufacture. The department has also increased monitoring at permit bars to ensure they do not sell non-excise liquor. Between April to November 18, the revenue has been Rs 7,022 crore as against Rs 6,799 crore during the corresponding period last year."

In the results declared on Tuesday, Parinay Fuke, a two-term corporator from Nagpur won the Bhandara-Gondia seat while Tanaji Sawant, another 'outsider' fielded by the Shiv Sena, won the Yavatmal seat.Fuke, who has a Congress background, joined the BJP barely four months ago. But he had latched on to Devendra Fadnavis right from the day he was sworn in chief minister. This proximity as the 'CM's man' earned him a chance to contest his first legislative election and emerge successful. He defeated two-term MLC Rajendra Jain of the NCP. Jain is a close associate of NCP stalwart Praful Patel, for whom the party's defeat on his home turf is seen as a huge political jolt. Money power and influence pedelling are known to play crucial role in these elections.With Fuke, a Nagpur resident, now billed to be MLC, the city's power quotient has gone up a notch further. The number of legislators residing in the city has now gone up to 13. (See box). The city is already power high with the chief minister and a powerful Union minister representing Nagpur. Praful Agrawal, son of Congress MLA Gopaldas Agrawal of Gondia, was also in the race but lost his maiden election. In fact, Fuke's win was largely on the basis of a tacit understanding with the Congress. Most of the second preference votes of the Congress went to Fuke, ensuring a BJP win.A sitting corporator of NMC in his second term, Fuke is the 20th corporator ever, and fourth sitting corporator from the city to be elected legislator. In the first preference counting, Fuke took a lead by securing 153 of the 387 votes while Jain got only 117. In the second preference votes, Fuke got 67, taking his tally to 220 while Jain managed only 20 for a total of 137. Agarwal of the Congress had to be content with the number three position with 112 votes. Five votes were invalid.In the last election from the seat, the then sitting corporator from NMC Sandip Gavai, also BJP candidate, contested against Jain and lost by a huge margin. That the NCP and Congress fought separately and fielded two candidates, splitting the secular vote, aiding the saffron surge in both seats wrested from the NCP.In Yavatmal, Shiv Sena candidate Tanaji Jaywantrao Sawant defeated his nearest rival and Congress nominee Shankarrao Bade by a margin of 270 votes. Sawant secured 348 votes while Bade managed to get only 78. Independent candidate Sandeep Bajoria (the sitting NCP MLC) polled only two votes while five votes were found invalid. There were a total of 439 votes of which 433 voters turned up to exercise their franchise last Saturday.A Pune-based sugar baron, who also runs an education empire in western Maharashtra, Sawant was sent by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to try his luck in Yavatmal. The Congress's campaign projecting Sawant as an outsider failed miserably."

For all other purposes, right from the ingredients to the preparation, associating manddare with rice or sago fritters is entirely misleading.For one they are sweetish, and two, these lightly coloured crispies are prepared from red pumpkin, a fruit that grows in abundance during the last quarter of the year.""In the past, manddare were prepared in the economically backward homes,"" says former teacher E Costa of Colva, sharing how culinary ingenuity came into play to create this well-appreciated treat.Historian and author Fatima da Silva Gracias avers by this and says that the preparation, though tasteless, was once a must among the underprivileged, as it was economical and popular in South Goa, particularly Salcete.""Pumpkins are easy to grow. So right after the feast of the Holy Cross, on May 3, people would plant pumpkin seeds,"" Costa says.Our agri-savvy ancestors apparently put a lot of forethought into choosing when to sow the seeds. ""Planting the seeds in May meant they would be saved from the deluge of monsoon showers during the vulnerable sprouting stage,"" Costa says, adding that by the time the monsoon came around, the sapling was ready to soak up the water and bear fruit.By October-end, the pumpkin which had, proverbially speaking, been fattening, is ready for plucking.""Not many know how to prepare manddare anymore,"" says homemaker Senia Costa e Dias of Carmona , adding that it is only the older generation that will be able to share the recipe today. Nevertheless, she just about manages to gather the technique from her sources.""Boiled pumpkin and rice are ground together with sugar to a paste that is neither too slurry nor too pasty,"" she says, which makes it clear that the preparation process requires practice and skill.The mixture is then spread into small, flat pancake shapesnot too thin, not too thickin bowls. These are steamedideally in a konfro (steamer)sun dried and stored. They are brought out on Christmas eve when they are deep fried and placed in airtight containers, ready to be served the next day.""Food colouring may be added to the dough to lend the wafers a colourful look,"" says Gracias.Colourful or not, pushed to the periphery of culinary memory or not, manddare still feature prominently in several cookbooks and blogspots, with a detailed guide to mastering these tricky fritters.So, go right ahead and help the manddare make a comeback."

The group has been served a notice to present it reply, said an official from Osmanabad collectorate.Deshmukh, however, has clarified that he has relinquished his position as head of the group after swearing in as minister. I have been in the political scene for more than 15 years and in the cooperative movement for many years. I have done nothing illegal in my entire life and am ready to face any action if found guilty, he said.The group said the money was collected from various branches of the banks and was taken to the head office in Lohara with valid receipts.We have received the reply from the group and it will be verified from two different agencies. Besides the registry of the cooperative credit societies, the report will also be verified from a third party agency to ascertain if the group had permission and capacity to carry the cash of that quantum. Once the varification reports are received, the further action will be taken in next couple of days, said Neelesh Shrimgi, returning officer, Osmanabad."

These stores have been accepting the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes and residents are eager to exhaust their supply of the old notes.At the citys two Kendriya Bhandar stores at Jal Vayu Tower and Kendriya Vihar in Sector 56, residents have been stocking up on months of provisions. One such resident of Jal Vayu Tower, Anu Gulati, said she brought three months supply of flour, wheat, pulses and sugar for Rs. 15,000.There is no point standing in queues outside banks for hours to exchange defunct currency. Stocking up on ration was a convenient option since these are non-perishable goods and can always be utilised, Gulati said.Rishi Mathur, the official spokesperson of Kendriya Bhandar, confirmed the increase in sales due to people stocking up on rations.On an average, the Kendriya Vihar store had daily sales of Rs. 80,000 and the Jal Vayu Tower store of Rs. 45,000. Now, the two stores have cumulatively seen an increase of 80-100% in sales, he said. The Kendriya Vihar store is now doing business of Rs. 1.5 lakh daily and Jal Vayu Tower store of Rs. 80,000.Similarly, officials of Mother Dairy, which has 29 milk booths and 22 Safal outlets in the city, said that milk and Safal booths in Gurgaon had average sales of over Rs. 25,000 and Rs. 15,000 per day respectively.While the sales of milk have increased by only 3%, they said sales of vegetables and fruits at Safal outlets have jumped 10%.There have been many reports of people visiting the Mother Dairy and Safal stores to get change, which has been a hassle. Hence, most booths are being equipped with digital wallet (Paytm service) and SBI SmartChange cards (rechargeable smart cards), said Sandeep Ghosh, business head (milk), Mother Dairy.Haryana Fresh, which supplies farmers produce directly to consumers by removing intermediaries and hence bringing down costs and logistics, has one outlet at Nirvana Country in Sector 50 that did an average daily business of Rs. 8,000.Now, officials at the outlet have reported a 3-4% jump in sales and said they were accepting the old notes if the total bill was divisible by Rs. 500 or Rs.1,000. However, they said the outlet was not handing out loose change.Two of my neighbours and I shop there for daily groceries.

Officials at the circle office near her settlement sent her back asking her to first make Aadhar cards for herself, her four children and her mentally challenged husband. When she returned after seven months with all the necessary documents, Devi was told that issuance of new cards was put on hold.Like Devi, nearly 30,000 poor families are in queue to be enrolled under the National Food Security Act, 2013 as Delhis quota of ration card holders has long been full. In fact, the city crossed its threshold of 72.8 lakh and now has a list of over 72.91 people, who are eligible to avail the benefits under the scheme.Our software gets locked at the threshold. The remaining 13,775 applicants have been verified and will be granted ration cards when invalid beneficiaries are deleted from the list, said KR Meena, secretary-cum-commissioner of Food and Supplies (F&S) department.People wait outside a ration shop in Bawana.

Officials say there are a number of ration card holders, who are no longer eligible and the usual computerised methods of scrutinising bogus beneficiaries is not effective. The F&S department is planning to conduct a detailed survey from January to March but that too is subject to availability of manpower as it has only 184 officials on the field against a sanctioned staff of over 600.We have 19.5 lakh card holders in Delhi and the survey is not possible with just 30% of the sanctioned staff available. We have taken up the matter with the minister. Lets see if we can borrow staff from other departments, Meena said.According to Amrita Johri, an activist working under the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, NFSA in Delhi has been patchily implemented with the needy being excluded. The homeless, the transgenders and the differently abled are the ones who do not have ration cards because they do not have Aadhar cards or ID proofs mandatory in Delhi, even after the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhar cards was not compulsory, she said.Johri said that the Delhi government can allocate funds for the scheme beyond the sanctioned quota financed by the Centre. There is a lack of will on the part of government. AAPs election manifesto promised providing dal and oil under the Public Distribution System in the city. More than 10 states provide pulses or oil under PDS. But, Delhi is yet to implement it, she said."

Even after having a handsome turnover, the committee still has over 30 quintals of dry fruit stored in sacks at the prasad manufacturing unit on Chintaman Road.Recently, workers found that the stock is rotting after which the fruits have been kept to dry under sunlight.The collector said devotees need not shy away from procuring prasad as no sub-standard or contaminated article has been or will be used in making the prasad.The temple committee prepares prasad by mixing dried dates, almond, cashew, sugar and sells it at a rate of Rs 300 a kilogram."

While the circulars released by UGC are not binding, affiliated universities and colleges are expected to follow the prescribed rules.The circular even suggests ways the institutes can implement the order.While the circular does not define junk food, circulars by other boards of education, including the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, refer to junk food as items that are high on calories, but low on nutrients.For starters, colleges have been asked to display information on markers such as body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, etc. Orientation programmes have been recommended for staff as well as students so as to put across the point to the youth as soon as possible. Students too have been asked to form clusters among themselves and counsel each other about proper nutrition, exercise as well as other healthy habits.Some students, however, found this circular amusing.In this day and age, almost everyone is aware of the perils of consuming junk food, especially after being told about all through school. We are not school kids anymore to follow such strict rules, said Ankita Parekh, a student from Bandras RD National College.The more the restrictions, the higher the chances that well do the exact opposite. If we dont find our food in the canteen, students will opt for smaller joints outside the college which will not even be clean. At least our canteen serves clean food, said Sachit Ramesh, a student of Mithibai College, Vile Parle.While colleges have given a thumbs-up to the initiative, many thought banning junk food will not help much. Creating awareness about healthy eating is something all colleges can easily adopt, and this can help students understand the problem. Unless students practice self-restraint , simply banning something will not help the cause, said Vijay Joshi, principal of K J Somaiya College, Vidya Vihar.What colleges will have to do Implement measures to sensitise students on ill effects of junk food Universities can serve as important data sources on students health. Information on markers like body mass index (BMI)/percentage of body weight/waist hip ratio, etc can help create awareness among students towards their health. BMI is the approximate measure of whether an individual is overweight or underweight, calculated by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres Conduct orientation programs for faculty and staff on health issues Create wellness clusters under the Students Welfare Department to counsel students about proper nutrition, proper exercise and healthy habits. These wellness clusters can also provide psychological support to the students to prevent and reduce the incidence of obesity in young studentsSimilar incidents In January this year, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) directed all affiliated schools to take junk food off their canteen menu. Schools were also asked to inspect lunch boxes of students, create awareness about nutritious food and regularly monitor students health. The circular was released following a report by the Ministry of Women and Child Development addressing consumption of foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar (HFSS) and promotion of healthy snacks in schools In May 2012, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had directed all schools to ban junk food and carbonated drinks, calling them rich in calories but deficient in vital nutrients. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations in May 2012 and all schools were asked to implement this ban at the earliest"

It was just a few hundreds, but they would need it more than us, says Seema Wazir, a mother of two and an HR consultant.Others are extending the use of their debit and credit cards to those who rely on cash.

He understands the situation and does not ask for the money, she says.Grocers, restaurants, even doctors have been accepting Rs500 notes, or offering credit.Mehernosh Khajotia, who runs a dessert business, headed to Crawford Market for packaging material with Rs1,000 notes and not much hope on Thursday. My usual supplier was not accepting the big denominations, Khajotia says. I asked Will you take a cheque from an old friend? and he made an exception for me.When Wazir ordered chicken from Marks Cold Storage yesterday, the store sent over Rs1,070 worth of the meat when she explained she was short on cash. Neighbourhood shops record transactions against the customers contact details in lieu of immediate payment. Their notebooks are at the ready, says Lewis, who took home coffee worth Rs470 on Wednesday. Purohit has also let three dining parties leave without paying. The bills were between Rs500 and Rs2,500, he says. Were all in a bad situation, Im confident theyll be back.Some adjustments do more than keep the wheels of business turning. Rishan Shah, a Chembur resident and management student is trying to get his fellow residents of Satellite complex to share rides with neighbours to avoid spending cash on taxis and rickshaws. No one expects to be repaid for this, but were discussing it at a building meeting soon, he says. Shah knows getting around is tough. He was stuck at CST station on Wednesday trying to get the ticket office to break his last Rs1,000 when a stranger swiped his SmartCard and offered him and a Thane-bound commuter one-way tickets home before disappearing into the crowd."

It is probable that the number of people diagnosed with diabetes are similar to the number of people who have the condition but are undiagnosed. Patients with one or both diabetic parents must get themselves screened, said Dr Hemraj Chandalia, director of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, Jaslok Hospital, Peddar Road. Chandalia added that worldwide, the average delay in diabetes diagnosis is three years. It is similar in India. There is a need for better screening to minimise complications, he said.Doctors said people with metabolic syndrome have five times the risk of developing diabetes compared to the general population. People with metabolic syndrome could be pre-diabetic. In these cases, organ damage begins much before blood sugar levels elevate and the patient is termed diabetic, said Dr Sandeep Rai, professor and unit head, MGM Institute of Health Sciences.By the time these people develop diabetes, complications of the kidney, eye and nerves have set in. They may eventually require dialysis, retinal injections and amputation, which significantly adds to the cost of managing the disease, he added."

A recent study has found that consumption of burgers, oily and fried food, salted snacks, dry fruits and nuts may be associated with asthma.The study asked 125 healthy individuals and asthmatics each were questioned about their food habits in a questionnaire with 80 food items under 12 food categories.The consumption of fast foods  burger, pizza and toast  more than three times a week was significantly higher among asthmatics. So was the consumption of salted snacks (like potato chips, namkeen), fried snacks (like samosa, pakora), nuts and dry fruits (like almonds, cashew).The change from traditional to modern diet means that we are now consuming more preserved food, salt, refined sugar and saturated fat and less of fruits, vegetables, milk and dietary fibres. This modification in diet and lifestyle could be the reason for rise in prevalence of asthma, apart from environmental factors, said Dr Raj Kumar, one of the authors of the paper that was published in Pneumonologia I Alergologia Polska.Read: Statutory warning: Shortness of breath may be symptom of heart failureHigher saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, sodium, carbohydrates, sugar and preservatives in fried and junk food could be the reason there is a correlation between asthma and such food items, the study says.These food items are also known to lead to weight gain and obesity, which is a known risk factor for developing asthma, said Dr Raj Kumar.Other studies have already established an association of such food items with severe symptoms of wheeze, rhinitis and eczema.On the other hand, the researchers found that consumption of non-vegetarian foods like egg, mutton fish, chicken and beef more than three times a week was high among the healthy individual. So was the consumption of cereals, milk, milk products, non-vegetarian food, fruits and fruit juices."

To ensure transparency in their functioning and to prevent malpractices, the state made it mandatory for societies to audit their accounts every year, by firms empanelled by it. It has also made it mandatory to hold elections of the management committee every three years. While these rules help check malpractices in cooperative sugar factories or banks, for housing societies, complying with so many rules is often difficult, legislators said.There are 22,000 housing societies in Mumbai and it is not possible for residents who are members to take out the time to comply with the governments rules. The state should consider diluting certain provisions, demanded Mumbai legislator Ashish Shelar.Shelar said there should be provisions so that the procedure of holding elections and auditing accounts becomes easier for housing societies.The government is also studying how to protect the interests of particular castes or religions who have come together to form cooperative housing societies, Deshmukh said, in response to a demand by Shelar. Shelar had pointed out the members of Christian and Parsi communities are under pressure to change their bylaws to allow people from other communities to become members in some parts of Mumbai.Following discussions, the Assembly passed the bill that has a provision to allow cost accountants to audit accounts of co-op bodies. The bill was passed to amend the section 81 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act 1960 under which every cooperative society has to audit its accounts at least once in the financial year and within four months from the end of the financial year.The accounts are supposed to be audited by an auditor or auditing firm from a panel prepared by the Registrar and approved by the state government. However, each auditor is not supposed to handle audits of more than twenty coop societies in a year. Since the number of empanelled auditors is not sufficient considering the vast number of cooperative societies in the state, the government has included cost accountants to the list of auditors, on the lines of similar provisions made by neighbouring Karnataka state.READ MOREMum-Nagpur Expressway: CM Fadnavis dream project in land-grab controversy"

Yet, more than a year since the project of installing Point of Sale (PoS) devices at the 2,282 odd FPSs in Delhi took off, only 1.3% of them have it so far.The Centre has set a deadline of March 31, 2017 for setting up a biometric system through which the ration card holders could get subsidised grains. While Delhi was supposed to be the showcase city by being the first to implement it, achieving the target on time seems unlikely.The state food and supplies department has floated as many as three tenders so far, but none could attract bidders for installation, operation and maintenance of the devices.We are adding a new feature of cashless transactions in the PoS devices. The final Request for Proposal (RFP) is ready and tenders will be floated soon. The selected bidder will begin work thereafter. Previous RFPs had several loopholes, a department official said. Owing to repeated delays, the Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) stepped in to revisit the project, and is now co-drafting the proposal.Food and supplies minister Imran Hussain took a review meeting on Thursday. With the installation of swipe machines, ration card holders can make payment for procuring food grains through RuPay Card, Debit Card, Credit Card etc, if they are short of cash. Cash option will remain though, he said.STATE OF THE PILOT PROJECTPoS were installed at 42 FPSsBy June, 2016, five machines were withdrawn due to malfunctioningmachines were withdrawn due to malfunctioning By December, 2016, 13 machines were withdrawn due to malfunctioningmachines were withdrawn due to malfunctioning Problems include: Machines not being user-friendly, poor battery life, problems of mismatching of fingerprints, poor networkThe Capital has 2,282 FPSs, with nearly 72.8 lakh people using them. By now, all of them were supposed to distribute essential commodities like wheat, rice and sugar through fingerprint or iris detection of beneficiaries.However, even the pilot project in which 42 such shops were installed with PoS machines is now gradually being withdrawn. Data accessed by HT revealed that, at present, only 29 FPS have functioning PoS devices.Food and Supplies Officers (FSOs) have complained that the machines installed in the few FPSs are not working efficiently. These are not user-friendly and have poor battery life. Many a times fingerprints do not match and poor network is a big problem, an FSO said on condition of anonymity.The delay is despite the fact that Delhi is one of the easiest cities to implement the project as it has 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding. This means the government did not have to spend anything extra in getting biometrics of ration card holders as Aadhar cards in Delhi are mandatory for getting enrolled under the National Food Security Act, 2013.DIGITISATION PLAN"

Once deposited in the banks, the trader issued cheques to a third party who subsequently got new currency notes from banks through encashing of cheques.Subsequently, the new currency notes were rendered to those who had parked the defunct currency notes with the sugar trader.The sugar trader and his associates charged commission from those parking the black money.Weve so far been able to track conversion of around `5 crore defunct currency notes into new currency notes through the suspected hawala racket. Further investigations are underway, the IT department official added.Meanwhile, similar search at the business establishment of a prominent jeweler in Sarafa Market area of Gwalior has revealed that the jeweller sold gold and jewellery worth around Rs 10 crore within a couple of days from November 8.I-T dept survey at two builders in Bhopal endsMeanwhile, the I-T department survey underway at the establishments of two builders in Bhopal since Tuesday ended on Thursday.The two builders whose head offices are located in Malviya Nagar and MP Nagar have surrendered a total of Rs 7 crore undisclosed income to the taxmen, but scrutiny of documents could take the figure of concealed income even further, the official added."

While some traders are accepting scrapped banknotes if a customer buys goods worth Rs 500.Besides, villagers alleged that traders in Chhota Nagda - the nearest town - have hiked prices of essentials like sugar and edible oil by up to Rs 5 per kg citing supply shortage from Indore.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes would no longer be legal tender from November 9 in a bid to tackle corruption, tax evasion and undeclared wealth. Indians rely heavily on cash for their daily transactions and those living in rural areas or who do not have bank accounts have been particularly hard hit by the move.When HT visited Kherod, a remote village in Dhar district about 80 km from Indore, villagers narrated how the dhanna seth (rich traders) of Chhota Nagda are exploiting them.If you need cash urgently you can get it in Chhota Nagda but money lenders only give Rs 400 in exchange of recalled `500 banknote, said Balram Rathore, a small shopkeeper who gets his supplies from Chhota Nagda. As I am facing shortage of new banknotes, my business also got down by 50%, he said.Ansar Patel, a farmer of nearby Kushwada village, recounted a similar tale. I have not taken this years soybean crop to mandi as I dont want cheque payment or sell for lesser amount in cash. I also am not getting full value for old 500 banknotes at shops in Chhota Nagda, he said.Villagers are short of cash as cooperative banks, where most farmers have their accounts, have been kept out of the currency exchange scheme.Some villagers have managed to exchange a limited amount of old banknotes at regional rural banks  the nearest being 9 km away  but this scheme cannot be availed more than once.Traders at Chhota Nagda, however, deny the charges. We are accepting only the new currency or offering credit to our regular customers. Our sales are down by 70% since demonetisation, said Vijay Jain, a kirana merchant in Chhota Nagda.Chhota Nagda - a bustling town with a population of 15,000 - attracts customers from surrounding villages.Dhar collector Shriman Shukla told HT that he would get allegation of exploitation by villagers investigated.If traders are accepting old banknotes and offering goods or currency of lesser amount then I will get the allegation investigated. However, we dont have any reports of traders selling essentials at higher prices after demonetisation, he said.The central government has announced that the next focus was to supply new currency in rural areas, but for villagers in Kherod, there will be no post-harvest celebrations this year.CASHING INMoney lenders in the rural areas are taking advantage of the demonetisation by offering Rs 400 in lieu of old Rs 500 banknote in case of urgent cash requirementSome traders are accepting scrapped banknotes if a customer buys goods worth Rs 500Traders in Chhota Nagda have hiked prices of essentials like sugar and edible oil by up to Rs 5 per kg citing supply shortage from Indore"

Till a few years ago, he was the staff driver for vehicles of a premier export-oriented industrial undertaking in Bhopal and despite no longer being in job with the premier industrial house, he still resides in the staff quarters there.The taxi driver has claimed before the I-T sleuths that the money which he used to buy the jewellery had been pooled together by him to build a temple. However, he has been unable to give satisfactory answers about where the temple was to be built, from whom the token collections were generated and why the jewellery was purchased on the night of November 8.According to key IT department sources in Bhopal, the leads to the benami transaction were generated during the recent survey by department sleuths at the showroom of a premier jewellery brand located in Bhopals main commercial hub.The IT sleuths searched the taxi-drivers house on Tuesday and recovered jewellery worth Rs 20 lakh. However, when valued by a registered valuer, the ornaments were found to be worth a maximum of Rs 10 lakh, suggesting the over-invoicing of the sale by the showroom to help park black money.The search also revealed that remaining Rs 18 lakh jewellery was recently sold by the taxi driver for just Rs 9 lakh to another premier jeweller.Acting swiftly in the matter, the concerned bank account of the taxi driver in a private bank at Bhopal has been freezed.Investigators confided to Hindustan Times that the probe has revealed a strong possibility that the taxi driver was used by rich and influential (possibly those associated with his ex-employer) people to convert black money into liquid assets.Search at premises of Indore doctor couple continuesThe search at three premises of an Indore doctor couple that started on Tuesday, continued on Wednesday. The raided premises include a big private hospital owned by the couple in Palasia area and residential premises in Pardeshipura area, a senior I-T department official said.According to a senior I-T department official in Bhopal, the search has led to several incriminating documents, three bank accounts containing over Rs 3 crores and three bank lockers. Jewellery worth over Rs 50 lakh has also been found during the raid at one of the premises.The searches were prompted by specific inputs about crores of rupees being parked in the accounts of the doctor couple.Meanwhile, the searches that were recently carried out at five premises of a prominent jeweller and a sugar trader have led to the two businessmen surrendering Rs 4 crore."

He has tuberculosis and is too ill to continue working as a labourer.As his wife Ramkumari, 35, now supports the family by going to the forest to forage for fruits, roots and honey to sell, Banbaris job is to stay home with his five other children and newborn grandchild. When her mother died, there was no one to feed her.In desperation, Banbari even considered giving away the little baby to another family, but then she fell ill. I tried, but I did not know how to look after the baby, he says. Admitting the baby to the SNCU (special new born care unit) at the district hospital in Shivpuri could not save her life.Jasoda and her daughter arent the only ones. Each year, 55,000 women die in India from preventable pregnancy-related causes. In most cases, infections and disease are compounded by chronic hunger and malnutrition  and a lack of access to affordable pre-birth healthcare services because of corruption or caste bias.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaThe maternal mortality rate (MMR) -- deaths per 100,000 live births -- fell from 212 in 2007 to 167 in 2013 but too many women are dying still.And as the maternal death rates remain the highest in the populous states of Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the total number of women dying is also high.To tackle this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan two weeks ago to provide free antenatal  before childbirth - care to pregnant women on the 9th of every month at government health centres and hospitals across Indias 687 districts.Building on the National Health Missions flagship Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), all pregnant women must be given a physical and abdominal examination, a tetanus shot and 100 iron-folic acid tablets.They must also be tested for anaemia, high blood pressure, high blood sugar (gestational diabetes) and other problems linked with pregnancy to lower Indias MMR and infant mortality rate (deaths of children under five years of age per 1,000 live births).Motherless childWomen in the lowest socio-economic sections in India are two-and-a-half times more likely to die of childbirth, largely because they dont get the medical support they need to deliver a healthy baby. Jasodas death is a case in point.Maternal deaths are not just about a woman dying, it also adversely affects the health of newborn and surviving children, who get trapped in a vicious cycle of malnutrition, stunting and wasting, says Ajay Yadav, founder of the NGO Badlav (Change), who has been working on health and nutrition in Madhya Pradesh.Incomplete antental care also lowers the chances of the mothers and childs survival. Malti Adivasi, 19, wife of Ram Lakhan, 25, lost her nine-month-old daughter Lakshmi to malnutrition earlier this year. She had delivered in a hospital but was not given iron-and-folic acid tablets or advice on feeding her baby after delivery. Lakshmi was given the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis and polio vaccine at birth, after which she got no vaccinations.Malnutrition begins after six months when the baby needs additional nutrition, which the mother is not able to provide. Thats when weight drops and wasting sets in, making the baby susceptible to infections such as pneumonia and diarrhoea, said Pramod Tiwari from the Manav Foundation, Sheopur.State of careFrequent infections aggravate chronic hunger with most severe acute malnutrition deaths taking place between nine months and five years.Apart from saving mothers, antenatal care and institutional deliveries boost chances of newborn survival. The mother gets a tetanus toxoid shot to lower risk of infection during delivery, iron and folic acid to boost blood haemoglobin levels, and nutritional advice on feeding the newborn within the first hour of birth.Breast milk contains all the nutrients a baby needs in the first six months of life and nursing a newborn within one hour of birth delivers highly nutritious colostrum (first milk) that protects against common childhood infections such as diarrhoea and pneumonia and boosts mental and physical development.Under the JSY, all services for the mother and her newborn are free and incentives are given to families to opt for institutional deliveries, yet corruption and apathy in the public health system make the poor hesitant in accepting services.Hospital staff sometimes demand a bribe up to Rs 500 for a delivery because they know mothers get Rs 1,400 for an institutional delivery. But since that money is transferred directly to the parents bank account, villagers have no money to give hospital and clinic and so they opt for home deliveries, says Yadav.Caste plays a role in the exclusion from health services, with marginalised tribes like the Saharias losing out both nutritionally, socially and economically, says Yadav. Unless delivery becomes inclusive, children will continue to be orphaned.Case study: Halki Adivasi, 25Halki Adivasi delivered a baby boy last month and grieved for her 18-month-old baby girl Parvati three weeks later.Three of her six children died between the ages of six months and one year over the past five years and now she lives in her one-room mud and thatch hut with her newborn, her husband Vishnu, 30, and two surviving children, son Radhay Shyam,8, and daughter Anjani, 7.Halkis baby boy Anand was born at home at 2 am but the umbilical cord was cut eight hours later because her husband Vishnu Adivasi, 30, could not get a midwife. She has three babies and has lost another three to malnutrition in Bhairopura village in Madhya Pradeshs Shivpuri district. (Virendra Singh Gosain/Hindustan Times)The family is clueless about what killed their children. They fell ill and died, is all he knows.None of the children have ever been vaccinated, including her month-old son Anand.Since no government health worker has ever visited their home, Halki missed all three of the antenatal screening benefits she is supposed to get free under the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) for mother and newborn health.Halki delivered at home at 2am the day before dushherra and lay with her baby with the umbilical cord attached all night till a birthing assistant reached her the next morning at 11 am and cut the cord.I went looking for a midwife at night but she couldnt come till the next morning, so we had to wait, said her husband Vishnu Adivasi, 30, who works as a daily labourer.Like it happened to many other women living in Bhairopura village in Madhya Pradeshs Shivpuri district, Halkis pregnancy slipped between the cracks and she did not get iron and folic acid supplementation and tetanus toxoid vaccination. The family will also not get the Rs 1,400 given to every mother who delivers in a government institution.Read | Wracked from within: In tribal Madhya Pradesh, TB continues to kill"

After the state government fixed the state advised price (SAP) for sugarcane at Rs 300 per quintal, which is Rs 26 less than what the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, had recommended, the farmers allege the prices are being controlled by mill owners.The SAP hike as compared to last year is mere Rs 5 per quintal. In comparison to Rs 295 per quintal offered by the Punjab government last year, the neighbouring state of Haryana had offered Rs 311 to its cane growers.Farmers blame the lobby of sugar mill owners for the poor remuneration. Why is the government not fixing prices on a par with Haryana, when the input cost, weather and varieties grown in Haryana are the same as in Punjab? questioned Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).The mill owners, who are part of the government, dont want farmers to earn anything and want to keep their profits intact... By depriving sugarcane growers of additional Rs 10 per quintal, the government has caused them a loss of Rs 67 crore, he said.I used to grow sugarcane over 40 acre ithin a few years, the area reduced to just one acre, because prices are not in proportion to the input cost . Sukhwinder Singh Dhillon, farmer, Bhattian, LudhianaJarnail Singh Wahid, who is the managing director of Markfed since 2008 and is contesting the forthcoming polls from Nawanshahr, is part of the SAP fixation committee. He also happens to own a sugarcane mill in Phagwara. How can we expect good returns for our produce, when mill owners play a key role in deciding the prices? questioned a farmer, requesting anonymity.A member of the SAP fixation committee, on the condition of anonymity, said Wahid exerted pressure on other members to support him on a reasonable hike in the SAP.Giving justification for the decision, Wahid, who is also the Punjab sugar mill owners association president, told HT that privately owned sugar mill suffered a loss of Rs 200 crore to Rs 300 crore each last season.We want to recover our losses and stay in the business. In case our mills shut down, who will process the sugarcane produced by the farmers? Jarnail Singh Wahid, SAP fixation panel member, Akali leader and mill ownerWe want to recover our losses and stay in the business. In case our mills shut down, who will process the sugarcane produced by the farmers? They (farmers) should understand this. An SAP in excess of 300 per quintal was not feasible, he said in a reply to the HTs query, while he was campaigning in Nawanshahr.Kamal Oswal, who owns a sugar mill in Amloh and is an adviser to the Punjab chief minister, is also being targeted by farmers for not letting a hike in the SAP. Oswal and Punjab agriculture minister Tota Singh, who heads the sugarcane SAP fixation committee, were not available for comments.Out of 16 sugar mills in Punjab, nine are in cooperative sector, while seven are privately owned. Seven other mills have already shut down in the state. Last year, the government supported private mills by paying Rs 223 crore to farmers from the state exchequer.I will also like to see more remuneration for the farmers. Even the 5 hike in the SAP was done after much persuasion, agriculture director JS Bains told HT. Bains said the SAP fixation committee members also took the plea that the fair remunerative price (FRP) fixed by the Centre was Rs 230 per quintal, much less than the SAP.The total sugarcane production in the state is expected to touch 68 lakh tonne this season. A decade ago, sugarcane was grown over 7 lakh hectare. Much to the dismay of experts, the area has shrunk to 1 lakh hectare, taking a toll on diversification."

He grows paddy on the side to feed his family.Baghel, therefore, has remained unaffected by the cash crunch sweeping cities and towns across India.But he fears the governments move to scrap high-value currency may come back to hurt him by fuelling extortion by Maoists, who use locals money to fund their insurgency.Read Part 1 of Demonetisation Tales: A lone man dispenses cash in Sunderbans Satjelia islandHe says the Maoists, who consider Bastar as one of their bastions, have been badly impacted by Centres decision as most of their cash reserves have been rendered useless.Police have stepped up vigil to stop them from laundering their high-value banknotes and locals fear the cash-starved Maoists will hit back by ordering a fresh wave of extortions.In the days to come, we will be squeezed between the police and the Naxalites.Aage aane vale samay mein hum hi pisenge police aur naxailyon ke beech, (In the days to come, we would be squeezed between the police and the Naxalites), predicts a fearful Baghel.In village after village of the region where the unresolved conflict has claimed more than 6,000 lives in the past 15 years, Baghels fears find ready resonance.Ab Naxali ka dabaav badhega aur gaaon mein police aana fir se shuru ho jayega. Aam tribal hee pisega in dono ke beech mein, (Now, police will start visiting the villages again and the ordinary tribal will be at the receiving end), the sarpanch of village told HT on condition of anonymity.Banks are few and ATMs fewer in the interiors of Bastar. As everywhere else, the great desperation for hard currency is not on display here. But what is palpable instead is growing nervousness over what the future may hold.Locals talk in hushed voices about the hit the Maoists have taken. Their coffers are empty. They have lost crores raised through extortions and hoarded in higher denomination notes, a villager tells his friends crowded around a tea stall under the lengthening shadows of a setting sun.Another villager points out that he has heard of the Maoists already beginning to hold meetings in the more remote areas to levy taxes from the locals in the form of grains and forest produce on villagers. Someone else says some government teachers have also received notes to donate a months salary to the Maoists.Amid the stories, unanimity emerges among the gathered crowd that the Maoists will begin to extort with renewed vigour.Their voices drop further when they begin discussing what the police could possibly do in response. One among the crowd reported seeing more police on the roads, checking vehicles for cash.Police officials say every deposit of more than Rs 5,000 is under scanner in Bastar. We are not leaving any stone unturned in trying to stop the Maoists from laundering their money, a senior official said.DM Awasthi, additional director general of police, explains that though the heat will be turned on businessmen and contractors to ensure they do not bankroll Maoists, ordinary tribals will be dealt with care so that none are harassed. We realise their compulsions, he told HT.However, tribals such as Baghel remain wary. Neither can they defy the Maoists, nor can they ignore the police.Sushil Sharma, editor of local daily, Bastar Bandhu, insists the demonetisation drive has come to bite Bastar tribals in a different way. They are caught between the Maoists and the police. It will help if the government ensures they are not harassed and not booked under fake charges, he says.Some names have been changed to protect identity. This is Part 2 of our ongoing series on how demonetisation affects rural India."

He also lashed out at the previous government for lapses in initiating measures to curb the black money menace.Under the PDS, the government supplies fuel (kerosene), foodgrain and other essential commodities like sugar to poor families at subsidised rates. In rural areas, it is a major source for lower middle class families. The government is also planning to provide biometric ration cards to weed out fake cards that are used for black marketing foodgrains and fuel meant for PDS.Further, POS will be made available at 30,000 citizen facilitation centres in villages for farmers. Fadnavis added that all state government initiatives will gradually go cashless. The government plans to train 1,000 college students as volunteers to educate citizens about cashless transactions.Fadnavis dismissed allegations that foreign-linked payment gateways, such as PaytTM, were controlled by China or the Alibaba group. He said that there was no question of any apprehension of foreign country involvement.Responding to the Oppositions concern that the rural economy in Maharashtra is getting affected due to the Centres decision to not allow rural cooperative banks to conduct transactions in demonetised currency, Fadnavis said he would be leading a delegation of all party leaders on Thursday to meet Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and request for restrictions on cooperative banks to be lifted.Earlier, launching a scathing attack on the BJP-led government at centre over demonetisation, the opposition in both the Houses of the state legislature accused the government of making lives difficult for the rural population by banning acceptance of high-value notes in cooperative banks.Initiating the debate in the state assembly under rule 101, former chief minister and senior Congress member Prithviraj Chavan pointed out that by banning the transactions by cooperative banks, the Union government was destroying the rural economy.He alleged that the decision was taken with an eye on the Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Can the BJP and Fadnavis say under oath that the black money was not used in the Lok Sabha elections of 2014? Did they use debit and credit cards for electioneering? Chavan quipped. Attacking the ruling party, Chavan said that surprisingly, the government was promoting foreign linked payment gateways like Paytm.Ridiculing the cashless economy, Chavan said nowhere in the world had the cashless economy been fully implemented.Countering Chavan ,Fadnavis said the previous government had failed to ratify a United Nations treaty on black money which was waiting since 2004.Between 2004 to 2011, BJP led government at the Centre signed the treaty, thereby allowing access to accounts of all Indians in foreign banks.The opposition also came down heavily on the government over the issue in the upper house of the legislature.READ MOREMaharashtra guv asks universities to go cashless, accept fees through online bankingDemonetisation: Fee payments in Maharashtra may soon go cashless"
58d93228a3d24b224f24304f,Beating Both Sides of the Drum,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/beating-both-sides-of-the-drum/story-ujncePvxqKks40CUtQ1JeI.html,2016-11-23,"In the immediate aftermath of the demonetisation of high denomination notes, when Sharad Pawar was among the two Opposition leaders (Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar being the other one) who welcomed the Centres move, I suspected something was not quite right.It soon became apparent that Pawar had held his fire not to jeopardise Modis visit to the Vasantdada Sugar Institute in Pune, an autonomous body of cane growers headed by himself, to inaugurate an international conference on sugar.Both the leaders appropriately showered sugary praises on each other. While Modi may have been a tad more sincere about saying that Pawar has been working tirelessly in the interest of farmers over the last 50 years, I wonder how honest Pawar was in similarly complimenting Modi as a hardworking Prime Minister because less than a week later, it was clear Pawar had not meant a word he said about Modi.At an election rally in the suburbs, he not only ridiculed Modis obsession with a bullet train between Bombay and Ahmedabad, but also lammed the demonetisation policy as anti-poor and causing immense trouble to the common man that it was bound to bring about a change in the ruling dispensation after the elections.The state BJP was startled by the almost seamless change of track and described Pawar as a double dholki. But those who know Pawar well were not surprised. The Maratha warlords statements are always pre-meditated and carefully calibrated. His supporters know to always take his compliments with fistfuls of salt. When pictures of him and Modi at the Pune meet showing them seated, head to head, in cosy comfort first emerged, a political analyst told me, They are birds of a feather. And I think Pawar is still seeking an alliance with the BJP.Birds of a feather because Pawar and Modi are both of similar disposition in terms of their ambitions and belief in capitalism. While Modi achieved his target within a miraculously short period of time, Pawar had been trying for longer than we all know and is very embittered at his lack of success and thus is unlikely to really think nice things about Modi. So Pawar was more true to his self at the election rally when he faulted Modi for allegedly wasting Rs98,000 crore on one train when that money would have gone a long way in improving the lives of commuters on local trains of the metro cities in this country.But even if the BJP thinks that Pawar is speaking out of both sides of his mouth, they must know he was more sincere in his criticisms than he was while showering praises on the man in whose shoes he would dearly have loved to be. In those shoes, not only would the former agriculture minister have utilised that kind of money for the greater good of the poorer people in the country, he would also have understood instinctively how the demonetisation undertaken by the government would have affected the interests of the farmers who are at the start of the rabi season, after a good monsoon, but find their prospects torpedoed by the severe cash crunch that the policy has brought about.And Pawar has been more honest in his expression that he hopes that such alleged follies on the part of the Centre will help to vote the BJP out of power in the civic elections from now to early next year.I believe that although Modi did a fine job of praising Pawar to the skies, he may not have given any signals of a possible overt or even covert alliance with the NCP. The NCP has been blowing hot and cold with the Congress over this issue even though most local Congressmen are vehemently opposed to trusting the party again.But with the NCPs fortunes going steadily downhill, Pawar is in dire need of some astounding victories at a handful of elections to stay afloat in the near future. He clearly believes that that relevance has to be had more by being on the right side of the ruling party than allying with a defeated Congress.So we could have many more such double dholki comments and positions taken by him in the days to come. But I wonder if Pawar realises how much more irrelevant to the polity he renders himself by such frequent flip-flops?"
58d93256a3d24b224f24306b,The Politics of Populism: It's Dole Time in Punjab,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/the-politics-of-populism-it-s-dole-time-in-punjab/story-mD67SuOSi9vdlkTEE11SbN.html,2016-11-22,"Loan waivers, smart phones with free data and calling, free bus facility for school students, more free power, free medical care and what not  its raining freebies in Punjab ahead of the assembly polls due early next year.Be it the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) alliance, Congress or the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), they have all set off on a vote-centric populist streak, promising concessions, doles and waivers for one and all. Though the Punjab assembly elections are still to be formally announced, the poll players are indulging in competitive populism, going all out to outdo each other and virtually promising the moon to the electorate.While the AAP, which is contesting the assembly polls in Punjab for the first time, has unveiled a set of manifestos, making lofty promises, the Congress has tried to match them with its own bunch of fund-guzzling promises even before releasing its manifesto. The Akalis, who opened their bag of freebies in the last budget of present government a few months ago, are also unlikely to let anyone beat them in competitive populism.This unprecedented tide of generosity defies all economic logic in a state burdened with a debt liability of Rs 1.38-lakh crore due to unproductive borrowings and fiscal profligacy. The cost of freebies and subsidies has already reached unsustainable levels. But none of the parties has given the specifics of how much would the doles and promises made by them cost the state exchequer and how they plan to pick the tab. These are questions they neither want to pose not confront. The electors arent complaining, though.AAP first off the blocks in freebiesThe AAP, which had outsmarted its rivals in Delhi with populist promises that caught the fancy of poor and deprived sections, has taken the lead by unveiling a set of manifestos for the farmers, traders and the youth. It has tried to woo the youth  the main supporters of the rookie party  with the promise to create 25-lakh jobs and employment opportunities, extend the existing free bus travel facility for college students to school students also and start exclusive bus services for girls and women students.As the road to power in Punjab passes through Malwas peasantry, a loan waive off plan has been announced for small and marginal farmers with outstanding bank loans and waiver of interest for other farmers. The manifesto announcement was followed by a promissory note signed by AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal for loan waiver.They have also promised minimum support price of cost plus 50% and 12-hour power supply.Then, there is shagan of Rs 51,000 within one week of wedding of daughter of a farmer/farm labour and shagan deposit of Rs 21,000 in a bank account in the name of a newly born daughter to a farmer or farm labour. The party also promises to pay Rs5 lakh and give a government job for every eligible adult member of the families affected by farmer suicides in the past 10 years and increase the old age pension from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000. There are doles for urban and semi-urban vote banks, besides women entrepreneurs.Congress gives prudence the go byThe Congress is trying to outwit both the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in populism. Going by the announcements of Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh such as 50 lakh 4G-enabled smart phones to states youth with one-year of free data and calling after coming to power, the party seems to have given fiscal prudence a go by after the Akalis romped home in two back-to-back elections riding on poll doles.To reach out to farmers, the party has announced to waive farm loans under the scheme, Karza Kurki Khatam, Fasal ki Poori Rakm. It had fanned out to 9000 plus villages of the state to enrol farmers who are seeking a debt waiver and even those who were supporting the move. A total of 30 lakh (maangpatra) have been filled by the party. Amarinder pegs the bill of rural debt at Rs 35,000 crore but says the Congress will not need to source funds to waive it off. The Modi government has saved Rs 3 lakh crore through oil subsidy and can use a part of the savings for the same, he adds.Also, the PPCC chief has announced 300 units of free power to poor, up from 200 units provided to the SC and BPL families already, besides tea and sugar for beneficiaries under the atta-dal scheme. Other promises include increase in financial assistance under the Shagun Scheme to Rs 50,000 and old age, handicapped, widow pensions to Rs 2,000 a month.All these promises have been made even as the party manifesto is still in the works. The committee headed by Rajinder Kaur Bhattal has Manpreet Badal as its convener. As finance minister under the Parkash Singh Badal government, Manpreet had turned a rebel and taken a stand against populism, especially free power to farmers. But as part of Congress poll promises panel, he has already promised free power will continue. More poll sops may be in the offing.SAD govt opens purse, much more to comeA past master in giving out freebies, the SAD-BJP alliance, which is in power since 2007, has also made its intentions clear. The first signs of how the Akalis plan to try and sway the game were given when they came out with a please-all budget replete with populist announcements in March this year.The Badal government announced 20 vote-clinching sops in the Budget 2016-17 with financial benefits to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore for the youth, farmers, weaker sections, students and the pilgrimage-minded oldies. The farmers, the traditional vote bank of the SAD, have been a huge beneficiary of free power that costs the state a whopping Rs 6,000 crore a year. The subsidy is set to soar further with the government releasing 1.65 lakh new tube well connections  a large number of them in Bathinda, the ruling clans political turf.But there was more for them in the budgetary proposals  Rs 5-lakh insurance cover with annual free medical facility of up to Rs 50,000, interest-free crop loan of Rs 50,000 per crop to small and marginal farmers, a provident fund-cum-pension scheme and some tax concessions for progressive farmers.The largesse included cycles to girl students, modern gymnasiums in towns and villages, free sports kits to youth, highly subsidised atta-dal to 30-lakh families, utensils to mahila mandals and state-sponsored pilgrimage to not only the Sikh shrines, but also to prominent Hindu and Muslim spiritual sites within and outside the state.And thats the size and scale of freebies and populist schemes initiated by the Akalis in the run up to the assembly polls even before they have come out with their manifesto. The SAD hasnt fulfilled several of its promises made in the 2012 assembly elections. But thats hardly going to stop the party from showing any restraint.With demonetisation hitting the poll kitties of all the political players hard, they will be more dependent on freebies and sops than ever before. Dont be surprised if these doles are just a beginning."

Instead, the cabbage took a tad longer and by the time a deal was made the agriculture market was reeling under a cash crunch that slashed prices of all farm produce.When Gunjal, a farmer from Khandgaon village in Ahmednagar district finally sold his cabbage, he got only Rs 6,000 for the entire acre of produce instead of Rs 80,000, the market price he could have got earlier.On the heels of three consecutive droughts and unseasonal rains, Gunjal and his family was counting on this cabbage field to make some headway in 2016. ``The money I would have got from the cabbage would have gone into planting of pomegranates in this season, paying back one installment of loan, running the house and paying labourers. Now, I have been left with half a field of cabbage that even the trader did not bother to take and will have to plough over it, said Gunjal, whose family including two other brothers owns 16 acres of land, where they grow vegetables, sugarcane and fodder crops.Like Gunjal, lakhs of farmers in rural Maharashtra are facing the brunt due to demonetization as the cash crunch has led to a drop in prices of farm produce. Majority of agriculture markets in the state that have so far been dealing solely in cash, were working at only 50 % or less of their capacities this month.With the district co-operative banks, where a majority of farmers have their transactions, not getting enough cash from the state banks, currency has only a notional value even for the relatively well to do sugar cane farmers, as they cannot withdraw money from their accounts. The result is that the entire cycle of transactions in the farm sector from commissioning agents to landless labourers, has been disrupted.`` My farm labourers have to be paid weekly in cash. I owe them Rs 20,000 already. I have had to let go of sowing in this rabi season because there was no money in hand. I lost 60 per cent of my last onion produce in the rains. The remaining 40 per cent or 100 quintals I brought to the market but traders have no money to pay me,  said Namdeo Karade, farmer from Ahmednagar in Western Maharashtra. ``I have sold my entire produce on trust to a trader; he will pay me when the cash is handy in a couple of days. I have never been paid in cheque before, what if it bounces?At the Sangamners APMC, traders and agents owe farmers like Karade nearly Rs 5.72 crore in the last 15 days. At the Ahmednagar APMC, that makes a profit of Rs 9.4 crore, nearly Rs 12.10 crore is pending in payments to farmers in the 14 days from November 8 to November 26.``We are functioning at 50 per cent of our capacity.. the cash crunch has slashed all prices especially of fruits, vegetables by 30 to 40 per cent. But, cheque payments have slowly started with 35 to 40 per cent of payments being done in cheques. It is going to be slow but the shift can be made as all farmers do have bank accounts. The problem is that clearance of cheques can take as much as 10 days, said Abhay Bhise, secretary of Ahmednagar APMC.By the time the shift to cheque payments is 100 per cent and farmers can actually get their hands on their hard earned cash, the rabi sowing season will be over. In this shift, many a small farmer, will be hit so badly that it will take him another year to recover, that too only if the monsoons are good.Rajaram Akolkar for instance is among those, who says, survival will be difficult. Akolkar drove on his motorcycle 53 kms from the drought prone Pathardi taluka to come to APMC in Ahmednagar, carrying with him one quintal of lemons, seeking a better price. He was however offered only Rs 8 for a kilo of lemons and he can return home with Rs 800, but this pricely sum includes one old Rs 500 note.`` I have no choice but to accept Rs 800 being offered to me, including one old Rs 500 note, stand in a queue to deposit the money and withdraw it. I have a Jan Dhan account in a nationalized bank but the branch is away from my village and will cost me one days work. I need the cash now, he asked. After demonetization, Akolkar was forced to abandon his 200 bags of onions in local market at Pathardi, for the lack of buyers. In APMCs, farmers like Akolkar sitting on gunny bags of produce from ginger to carrots, hunting for buyers and finally abandoning produce is not uncommon.READ MOREProtest against demonetisation in Mumbai: Congress leader calls Centre anti-poorDemonetisation effect: Fewer property registrations in Maharashtra"

On gathering critical evidence from a survey about anomalies, a proper search of residential and business premises is done by taxmen.Meanwhile, four catering groups in Indore have surrendered Rs 5 crore concealed income before the I-T department.Surveys and searches in the past fortnight led the I-T department to concealed income of Rs 100 crore, 50% of which pertains to builder groups in Jabalpur and Raipur. Substantial undisclosed income is likely to be revealed by surveys at the premises of two prominent builders in Bhopal also, the I-T department official said.In Gwalior, two fresh searches are going on at five premises of a prominent jeweller in Sarafa Bazar and a sugar trader in Dal Bazar.Notably, gold and jewellery worth Rs 100 crore were sold in the states four cities - Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Ratlam - within hours after withdrawal of 500 and 1,000 banknotes was announced by the prime minister.Out of the 1000-odd people, who made the purchase to convert the recalled banknotes into liquid assets, up to 95% are fictitious people.Rs 14.36 lakh cash seized in BhopalThe Bhopal polices crime branch has seized cash worth Rs 14.36 lakh, including newly introduced Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 banknotes, from the possession of four men. Acting on a tip-off, crime branch officers on Wednesday intercepted a car in Habibganj and made the recovery. The seized cash includes 239 banknotes of Rs 2,000 and 54 banknotes of Rs 500 besides Rs 100. We asked them about the source of the cash but they failed to give any satisfactory answer. Police registered a case and informed the income tax department, town inspector (crime) MK Mishra said.Rs 7.5 lakh in new notes recovered in SagarPolice have recovered newly introduced Rs 2,000 banknote worth Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 100 currency worth Rs 1.5 lakh from two people in Sagar. City superintendent of police Gautam Solanki said suspects Deepak Jain and Sanjeev Jain were arrested. Solanki said both the suspects told police that they were businessman and they got currency using their bank accounts. Deepak is a resident of Gourjhamar village and Sanjeev belongs to Makronia.

By 2017, it could grow by more than 30%.But what happens when there is high prevalence of packaged food in your diet? For an average American, nearly two-thirds of his or her daily calories came from ultraprocessed food, according to a study by Carlos Monteiro at University of San Diego.The main culprits, however, are sodium and added sugar. Sodium is present in almost every packaged food, even cornflakes, says Dr. Spriha Mittal, chief dietician at Genphy Home Healthcare, a Delhi based nutrition consultancy.The possible health risks of consuming too much sodium are high blood pressure and hypertension.Talking about the US, Dr. Mittal says that processing of food leads to the stripping down of nutrients. When food is stored to maximise the shelf life, even without refrigeration, it will have preservatives that are harmful in the long run.If you are going to opt for packed food, make sure you read the labels properly, says Lovneet Batra, clinical nutritionist at Fortis La Femme in Delhis Greater Kailash. The labels list the proportion of the ingredients in descending order. If the top ingredient is sugar or refined flour, then thats bad."

Solely on the sale of milk, Gadekars family managed to marry off the daughters of the house, take and pay back the loans and do farming. In a nut shell, the milk money has helped Gadekar fight the vagaries of climate and market price for crops.But, over the last one month, Gadekar has found out that while this income  from selling 17 litres of milk daily  has not stopped, it has no value for him. Nearly, Rs 15,000 is sitting in Gadekars account with the Kanifnath milk co-operative society in his village in Raitewadi. The income is from the last two fortnightly payments from the Sangamner Taluka Co-operative Milk Producers Sangh made to the Ahmednagar district central co-operative bank and then transferred to his milk co-operative society. But, he has no access to this money.The withdrawal limit for the entire milk co-operative society that has an account with the Ahmednagar DCC, taken as one individual holder, is Rs24,000 for a week. In Gadekars village alone, there are more than 200 members linked to the Kanifnath milk co-operative society.We are trying to distribute the money in installments, giving more to those who are in dire need. But, its way too little. Most of the villagers now are living on credit, but how long can that last , asks Santosh Mandekar, chairman of the Kanifnath Milk Producers Co-operative Society.In adjoining, Khandgaon village, its the same story. Khandgaon with a population of 3,500 people has 786 members linked to the local milk dairy.I was counting on this money for my rabi sowing. Do you know how much investment is required to grow onions on one acre ? It can take as much as Rs40,000. I was counting on rotating some of the money got from milk and sugarcane payments for this, instead I am now running pillar to post to just get my own income in my hands, said Shivaji Misre, farmer from Khandgaon village. Misre has Rs25,000 as the first installment for his cane payment from the Bhausaheb Thorat Co-operative Sugar factory and Rs10,000 from the milk payment sitting in his account.On the whole, the Sangamner Taluka Co-operative Milk Producers Sangh that sells milk under Rajhans brand, has around 50,000 members (only from the taluka), organised under as many as 207 dairy societies. It collects nearly 2.30 lakh to 2.70 lakh litres a day and has daily payments worth Rs 70 lakh to the milk producers spread across 171 villages. All these transactions are carried out through the district central co-operative bank.The co-operative sugar factorys first installment to its 22,000 member farmers is to the tune of Rs34 crore. Our co-operative ecology is very strong. The issue is not cashless transactions; we started RTGS and cheque payments over a decade back. The problem is the cash crunch, which has affected the entire supply chain from our wholesale buyers to retailers across the state and even in Surat to our individual members, said Dr P J Ubalepatil, managing director of Sangamner taluka milk co-operative.To put this in perspective, one needs to understand the states co-operative sector. For instance, Sangamner in Ahmednagar district is one of the most successful models set up by co-operative doyen and Congress leader Bhausaheb Thorat, currently run by his son and former revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat. In the taluka, everything from the sugar factory to milk dairy and even petrol pumps are run on co-operative basis, which means group of farmers are stakeholders in the business. All their transactions are in turn linked to the Ahmednagar DCC that has 286 branches in the district, with 39 branches in Sangamner taluka alone. When we ask for Rs 10 crore as our requirement, we get Rs25 lakh to Rs30 lakh in cash. How are we to disburse this among our 10 lakh account holders ? One understands that there has been mismanagement in various district co-operative banks but why paint the entire sector and all banks as bad ?, asks Raosaheb Varpe, Managing Director of Ahmednagar DCC.He added, Our bank has no such history, instead we have been very successful. We have been given our license by RBI. When one of our account holders wants to withdraw Rs24,000, we cant give him the amount. We offer Rs2,000 to Rs 4,000 and at the maximum Rs 10,000.The co-operative sector in Maharashtra has largely been in the hands of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, who have dominated the district bank, sugar as well as milk co-operative sector. Several banks, sugar factories have had to be liquidated following flagrant mismanagement of its accounts but many others run successfully and continue to hold the strings of the rural economy. For now, the demonetization decision has put a spoke in the wheels of this entire sector, affecting the livelihood of lakhs of farmers.The co-operative sugar factorys first installment to its 22,000 member farmers is to the tune of Rs34 crore.Our co-operative ecology is very strong. The issue is not cashless transactions; we started RTGS and cheque payments over a decade back. The problem is the cash crunch, which has affected the entire supply chain from our wholesale buyers to retailers across the state and even in Surat to our individual members, said Dr P J Ubalepatil.To put this in perspective, one needs to understand the states co-operative sector. Sangamner in Ahmednagar district is one of the most successful models set up by co-operative doyen and Congress leader Bhausaheb Thorat, currently run by his son and former revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat. In the taluka, everything from the sugar factory to milk dairy and even petrol pumps are run on co-operative basis, which means group of farmers are stakeholders in the business.All their transactions are in turn linked to the Ahmednagar DCC that has 286 branches in the district, with 39 branches in Sangamner taluka alone. When we ask for Rs 10 crore as our requirement, we get Rs25 lakh to Rs30 lakh in cash. How are we to disburse this among our 10 lakh account holders ? One understands that there has been mismanagement in various district co-operative banks but why paint the entire sector and all banks as bad ?, asks Raosaheb Varpe, Managing Director of Ahmednagar DCC.Our bank has no such history, instead we have been very successful. We have been given our license by RBI. When one of our account holders wants to withdraw Rs24,000, we cant give him that amount. We offer Rs2,000 to Rs 4,000 and at the maximum Rs 10,000 if there is a dire need, he added.The co-operative sector in Maharashtra has largely been in the hands of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, who have dominated the district bank, sugar as well as milk co-operative sector. Several banks, sugar factories have had to be liquidated following flagrant mismanagement of its accounts but many others run successfully and continue to hold the strings of the rural economy.For now, the demonetization decision has put a spoke in the wheels of this entire sector, affecting the livelihood of lakhs of farmers.READ MORENote ban effect in Maharashtra: Cabbages worth Rs80,000 sold for Rs6,000Maharashtra to link its schemes for the poor with Aadhaar"

A press release talks about appetising stuff  building good bacteria in our intestinal tracts. To this end, nothing comes out of a package at 212 All Good; even cola is homemade, a secret, all-natural recipe by beverage developer Tanai Shirali, that tastes good enough for thirds.A three-page appendix details superfoods featured on the menu, from adzuki beans to yam, via groats and moringa, kraut and kabocha. Even the wood-laden room with warm lighting is filled with natural textures, distinct from the jagged artificiality of the mall around it.The focus is on tasty, clean eating, but there are plenty of options for diets of every stripe.The polenta twinkies with miso-aubergine mash were mushy and under-seasoned.Vegan Jain with no gluten? There are plates for you. A meal of carbs, meat, sugar and spice? There are options for you too.Our medium-rare, well-seasoned lamb burger came on a bun made from sorghum, potato and tapioca flour, topped with addictive pickled onions and a cashew-chilli sauce. It was served alongside methi salad, tofu mayo, and fermented carrot ketchup. Get the house hot sauce; chilli-heads may want to eat it with a spoon.There was an oddball salad on the menu that paired pear with smoked baingan. We expected to wince at first bite, but it was scaffolded smartly with walnuts, mozzarella and mixed greens, and glazed with a lush layer of kefir-spring onion dressing. Kefir is a fermented milk drink loaded with good bacteria, much like yogurt, or many fermented foods, and there are quite a few of these in 212AGs kitchen.Creamy, peppery, tofu mayo-coated chicken salad on gluten-free toast came with discs of lightly pickled tendli. The highlight in a dish of mushy, too-wet, under-seasoned polenta twinkies on miso-aubergine mash was the bright crunch of pickled carrot strings and the tartness of barnyard-y goat cheese (though there was too little of both).The chilli chocolate lentils (made with whole masoor) merely sounded imaginative.

Pollution Control Board (APPCB) will soon launch an app to know the pollution levels of Red category industries in the State, its member-secretary B.S.S. Prasad has said.The pollution monitoring stations in such industries would be linked to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and APPCB websites, Mr. Prasad said.The app is expected to be launched in about three weeks so that people can see for themselves the pollution levels in various industries by using it.He was interacting with the media after inaugurating a two-day workshop on New Waste Management Rules 2016, being organised by the board here on Wednesday.The CPCB categorises industrial sectors having pollution index score of 60 and above as Red category.Quoting the example of the Visakhapatnam Port Trust, he said it had been asked to set up three monitoring stations with a cost of Rs.3 crore. Upon linking the stations to the websites, people would be able to see what the suspended particulate matter (SPM) level was by using the app, he said.The same is possible for HPCL or Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, or other industries. The carbon dioxide or nitrogen dioxide levels can be seen on the app, he said.The pollution in the port was not as much as it was before as a number of steps were taken, he said.Online monitoringMr. Prasad said monitoring of pollution in industries shifted online with web cameras and stack monitoring. Units were being given time to set up web monitoring. To industries not installing the equipment, closure or cut in production notices were being issued. The CPCB had issued several notices and, of late, sugar factories were also served notices, he said. Without any connection with the PCB, 50 teams, with officials of the Industries Department, the CPCB, and the Ministry of Environment, from Chennai were inspecting establishments on computer-based random selection basis, he said.The officials had to give report online within 48 hours and there could not be any nexus as none would go to the unit for a second time, the member-secretary said.With such process, regional and zonal offices also could not exert any influence, he added.Aim is to enable people to know pollution levels in industries, says member-secretary"

Interestingly, Mohan India Pvt Ltd has now offered to help the court to bring buyers for this property.""The competent authority had placed advertisements in newspapers four months ago about the auction. However, not a single buyer turned up. The purpose of the sale is to return the money of investors. Mohan India has offered to bring buyers. Now it's up to the court to take a call,"" said a police officer.A total of 13,000 investors have lost their money in the Rs 5,600-crore cheating case, which was registered in 2013. Over two dozen people have been arrested in the case. The EOW has frozen 322 bank accounts holding Rs 171 crore, attached over 250 properties worth Rs 8,000 crore and seized 15 cars worth Rs 5.8 crore. Pankaj Saraf, an investor, had filed the offence and named Financial Technologies (FTIL) group chairman Jignesh Shah, MCX Stock Exchange MD Joseph Massey and auditor Mukesh Shah, among others.An EOW source said that the agency is also in the process of contacting real estate brokers and assets management companies to get a buyer. In January, a Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors court directed the competent authority, a deputy collector rank officer, to begin the process for auctioning of at least five properties, collectively estimated to be worth Rs 354.50 crore. The money fetched through the auction will be distributed among the victims. The properties that will be auctioned include the plot in Delhi, properties of Swastik Overseas Corporation in Ahmedabad (worth Rs 8 crore), a property belonging to NCS Sugar Pvt Ltd in Hyderabad (worth Rs 7 crore), a property of Metkore Alloys & Industries Ltd (worth Rs 50 crore) and another belonging to ARK Imports Pvt Ltd (estimated worth to be Rs 1.5 crore) in Ludhiana.Sources said Mohan India has also proposed breaking the Delhi plot into smaller units plots and then look for buyers. As many as 16 properties of Mohan India were attached by the EOW and the enforcement directorate.""We have arrested more than 30 people in this case. It's a huge investigation and our teams have filed three chargesheets so far. The final chargesheet will take time as we are still probing the case,"" said an officer."

Peal (61) appeared to be dying and they were not sure why.He slipped in and out of consciousness, his blood pressure plummeted, his potassium levels soared and his blood sugar spiked to 10 times the normal level. A doctor suspected a heart attack, but uncertainty left him urgently researching the situation on his phone.This was not a heart attack. Peals body was attacking itself, a severe reaction by his immune system that was a side effect of a seemingly miraculous cancer treatment aimed at saving his life. In the seven weeks prior, doctors at Yale University had combated Peals melanoma with two of the most promising drugs in cancer treatment. These medicines work by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer as ferociously as it kills other threats, like viruses and bacteria.Serious risksImmunotherapy drugs have been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer treatment, attracting billions of research dollars and offering new hope to patients out of options. But as their use grows, doctors are finding that these therapies pose serious risks that stem from the very thing that makes them effective: An unleashed immune system can attack healthy, vital organs, notably the bowel, the liver and the lungs, but also the kidneys, the adrenal and pituitary glands, the pancreas and, in rare cases, the heart.Doctors at Yale believe immunotherapy is causing a new type of acute-onset diabetes, with at least 17 cases there, Peal among them. In cancer clinics around the world, and in drug trials, myriad other side effects are showing up. Studies are finding that some drugs cause severe reactions nearly 20 per cent of the time, and in more than half of cases when some drugs are used in combination.Another recent paper found that 30 per cent of patients experienced interesting, rare or unexpected side effects, with a quarter of reactions described as severe, life-threatening or requiring hospitalisation. Some patients have died, including five in recent months in clinical trials with a new immunotherapy drug being tested by Juno Therapeutics Inc.More vigilance urgedThe upshot, oncologists and immunologists say, is that the medical field must be more vigilant as these drugs soar in popularity. And they say more research is needed into who is likely to get reactions, and how to treat them.We are playing with fire, said Dr. John Timmerman, an oncologist and immunotherapy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, who recently lost a patient to side effects.

In comparison, in the best performing block, Harsul in Nasik, 27.3 per cent suffer from malnutrition, down from 42.3 per cent in 2012.Just 24 hours before the report was presented, in reply to a calling attention motion moved on Thursday by 86 MLAs in the Assembly  citing around 8,000 child deaths due to malnutrition between April and August 2016  the State had claimed that its preventive approach on malnutrition is working.The report, titled Malnutrition Status in Tribal Belts, highlights shortcomings such as supply of grains infested with insects, worms and other contaminants to meal schemes, and children getting neither entitlements under the Public Distribution System (PDS), nor sufficient calories under the Supplementary Nutrition (SN) and Take-Home Ration (THR) schemes. Also, the report says, other contributing factors are poor health care facilities and constant migration. The report was prepared by the Rest of Maharashtra Legislative Development Board, and presented last week to Governor C.V. Rao. The Hindu has a copy.Senior officials told The Hindu the caloric requirement provided under both the SN and THR was questionable. In one such visit to a THR production unit, it was found care was not taken to clean grains before milling. Insects, small stones and unwanted material were found in the grains, the report says.The team found that food scarcity did not seem to be a contributing factor as much as poorly balanced diets. Except for carbohydrates and proteins, other food groups  milk and dairy products, fruit and vegetables, and fats and sugars  were missing from the diet. The Rs. 5.92 per child provision under the SN scheme was insufficient.THR food given to children was bitter / smelly / salty / raw / coarse. Even that was not given to deserving beneficiaries. Some ration was fed to livestock.Systemic faultsIn Nandurbar, PDS was irregular, delivered with two-month gaps, and the quota was not as per entitlement. Grain was of poor quality, and often sugar and kerosene were not delivered at all. In addition, the recipients were overcharged. Twenty per cent of families did not have ration cards, and many had to walk several kilometres to get their quota.Of the self-help groups (SHGs) surveyed, 63 SHGs received grains only once every three months during the five-month survey period (Jan 2016 to May 2016). In 44 Anganwadis Centres (AWCs), the team found either snacks were not served with meals or of poor quality and quantity. Also, 47 AWCs did not have toilets or had toilets in unusable condition.A silver liningOne area did show signs of improvement: health.There has been a dramatic increase in the use of health centres, regular counselling, increased awareness of pre-natal and ante-natal care, breast-feeding norms being followed, and immunisation schemes implemented. Kakarpati and Mungabri blocks, the worst-performing regions on other parameters  1.24 on AWC, 1.39 on THR, 1.50 on PDS, 1.67 on nutrition  scored a greatly improved health score of 2.63.Milind Thatte, member, Tribal Advisory Council of the Maharashtra Government, says, This report proves government is not facing up to the real problems to tackle tribal malnutrition; it is just looking to reduce the annual death count by trying to force feed tribal children artificial food under THR/SN schemes.."

The reason is that the government hasnt notified the price of procurement. It is a total failure of the government. He said the Centre had already notified sugarcane prices on April 6 for 2016-17. Along with that, Tamil Nadu government must announce a price after adding the incentive, he said. With Centre not increasing the prices for this year, he said that Tamil Nadu government must not take that as a base. In Tamil Nadu, it costs Rs. 2,450 to produce one tonne of sugarcane.The price must be fixed at Rs. 4,000 to account for transportation cost, he said."

Lipid levels may also exhibit mild seasonal variation with a peak in total cholesterol level, say health experts.Cholesterol levelsCholesterol levels are closely related to increased risks of getting heart diseases. The higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater is the risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack. Heart disease is one of the leading killers of women and men in the India. For every 10 per cent drop in your cholesterol level, your heart attack risk falls by 20 per cent to 30 per cent. It is thus important to raise awareness about detection of high cholesterol, management and prevention, said Indian Medical Associations Dr. K.K. Aggarwal.High prevalenceAlso the average age of patients who suffered stroke, in developing countries (India), is 15 years younger than those in developed countries like the United States .Strokes then become a major concern especially during season change.In India, nearly one-fifth of patients with first-ever stroke has been estimated to be aged 40 years or less. There is high prevalence of smoking, systolic hypertension, high fasting blood glucose level, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in our population at a younger age predisposing to stroke at a younger age, said Dr. Vipul Gupta, director, Neurointervention, Agrim Institute for Neurosciences, Artemis Hospital.He added that women are five times more prone to suffer stroke than men. This is attributable to the poor socio-economic status and literacy rate among women.Doctors also added that this is a good season to quit smoking. Smoking can not only precipitate heart attack, paralysis but also increase blood pressure.Other common complaintsThe other common complaints include common cold and flu, skin allergies, and respiratory ailments. We are already seeing a rise in the number of patients with problems that are related to dip in mercury. Cold and viral infections are especially a spoiler this season and require extremely robust personal hygiene to prevent from spreading, said Dr. Anil Bansal of the Delhi Medical Association.Dr. Bansal added that to stay healthy during winter, pick up a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced and nutritious diet, regular exercise and a healthy mind.Average age of stroke patients in developing countries is 15 years less than those in developed countries"

Photo: AFPFood and beverage companies may have to compulsorily disclose additional information on the sugar, salt and sodium content of their packaged products, as part of a proposed revision of Indias food labelling laws, said a top official of Indias apex food regulator.Currently, packaged food companies  including those who make instant noodles, biscuits, snacks and breakfast cereal  need specify only the energy, protein, carbohydrate and fat content on their covers.Information on other constituents such as sodium, salt, vitamins need not be disclosed unless companies claim it as part of their advertising pitch. For instance, details on fibre content in biscuits or the percentage of trans unsaturated fatty acids (trans fats) need not be specified unless a company promotes them as high fibre or zero trans-fat. This gives companies leeway to not disclose if, say, their high-fibre biscuits are also high on sugar or sodium. The World Health Organisation recommends that an adult should not have more than 25 gm of sugar per day while the American Heart Association says that an adult should not consume more than 2.3 gm of sodium. While both of these are critical to the healthy functioning of the body, they can, in large amounts aggravate diabetes and hypertension.We have set up various panels on scientific assessment and labelling to consider these issues and may incorporate this in our revised labelling norms, Pawan Agarwal, CEO, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, told The Hindu , However this is quite a challenge and requires much consultation.Draft likely in a monthA draft of these notifications is expected in a month but after that would require clearance by the Health Ministry for it to become a norm, according to Mr. Agrawal.On Friday, the Centre or Science and Environment made public a report Food Labelling, Claims And Advertisements  in the presence of Mr. Agarwal  detailing instances of under-reporting by several food and beverage companies.In contrast to best practices in other parts of the world, there is no mention of several other types of nutrition claims, Amit Khurana, programme manager, Food Safety and Toxins team, CSE, said in a statement."

Mahadev Prasad ended in a stalemate on Tuesday.The farmers were arrested after they came out of the meeting hall at the Deputy Commissioners Office to stage a rasta-roko.Govt attitude criticisedHe said the governments attitude towards farmers and using force to silence their voice was a clear indication of its growing intolerance towards the common man.But, the government was under the wrong impression that such coercive methods would discourage and demoralise the growers, he added. In fact, the KRRS would soon launch its agitation, he added.We are working out a plan to give a shock treatment to the government before the winter session concludes, the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader further said.The planned agitation and prior information to the police had helped the latter to plan arrests of the farmers and thwart their agitation.This time the Sangha would not announce any date or time for the agitation, he added.The organisationwill not announceany date or timefor the nextagitation"

Through all this, however, the much-adored trophy was never let out of sight.Everywhere captain Harjeet Singh went, the trophy went with him. When he wasnt getting selfies clicked, he would keep staring at it with a loving look.The only other hands that he would let touch the trophy were those of his teammates or staff members  so precious it was.Back at their hotel, the players were all told to pack up for an early morning departure. It was a perfunctory order, taken as such by the 18 boys who couldnt care less. Aaj raat neend kahan ayegi, abhi to kai din tak sone me dar lagega ki sapna toot na jaye (there will be no sleep tonight, in fact for many nights now, afraid that this might be a dream that will break when we wake up) each one of them said.And yet, when Harendra asked them to come together for a few photographs, not one dared to refuse.The toughest thing for them in these last two years was dealing with Harendra, he admitted, only to be shouted down by his wards.This trophy is for coach saab and Cody! was the chorus that, in the deserted lobby of the hotel, echoed like a war cry.Cody Tribe, the teams trainer, was around too, smiling indulgently at all his dietary restrictions being thrown to the wind.The man the players accuse of keeping them away from everything they desired to eat all this while, and are immensely thankful for doing so, was not going to deny them on the biggest day of their lives.For a team that wasnt allowed to taste sugar for almost three years, the day ended with a cake being wolfed down and smeared around in equal measure, in the presence of Tribe. It was only fair."

None of the factory workers was present at the event.The Minister, MLAs Naraswamy Naidu and Meesala Geeta, Collector Vivek Yadav and factory Managing Director D. Narayana Rao formally dropped sugarcane into the crusher. The target fixed for crushing this season is one lakh tonne. The purchase price of cane for 2016-17 has been fixed at Rs. 2,400 per tonne.Workers on strikeThere are 12 permanent employees, six permanent seasonal workers and 275 non-muster roll (NMR) workers. All the NMRs are on strike for the second day demanding a wage hike of Rs. 100 per day. However, following fruitful talks at a later stage between the Minister, the Collector and the representatives of the Bheemasinghi United Sugar Staff and Workers Union it has been decided to begin crushing from Monday.Wage hikeLater, the Minister told mediapersons that the management had agreed to increase wages by Rs. 50 per day from the present Rs. 344. As a result, the cooperative society has to bear an additional burden of Rs. 31 lakh for the season. MLA Kondapalli Appala Naidu, who was present during the talks, said that the societys accumulated losses over the years, for various reasons, stood at Rs. 42 crore and the APCOB was not ready to lend money to run the factory any more.Except in 2003-04 season when the government did not permit crushing due to mounting losses, crushing at the factory has been going on since 1976-77 with an average recovery rate of 9  9.8 per cent."

58e4aa0fa3d24b1c91ede730,Voices of rationality,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Voices-of-rationality/article16897280.ece,2016-12-18,"After waiting for hours in the queue for a darshan of Lord Venkateswara, the famous Tirupati laddu, which is made with chickpea flour, ghee, sugar, cashew, raisins, cardomom and sugar candy, does taste sweeter. But news this week that the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has turned down a Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) demand to get a food safety licence for its laddu would have definitely made Satyajit Ray smile.In Rays film Ganashatru, adapted from Henrik Ibsens 1882 play An Enemy of the People , Ashoke Gupta, a doctor, was pitted first against his brother Nishith, a businessman, and then the whole town when he announced that the holy water or charanamrita that people were drinking in a popular temple was contaminated, causing severe illness. The film was hugely anticipated because it was the first Ray film after his heart attack in 1983 forced him to take a break. Critics panned it, saying they missed the subtlety of his earlier films, but the questions it raised havent lost their relevance.A raging conflictDoes the situation in the Ibsen play occur in reality? If a play written in 1882 is still performed regularly, it perhaps answers that question. Ray went a step further in his adaptation by introducing the theme of religion, and thus immediately placing it in the realities of India where the conflict between science and faith still rages. The Tirupati management, for example, said its kitchen is an auspicious place where outsiders cannot be admitted, and hence getting a food safety licence was out of the question and unnecessary. With more than 3 lakh laddus being churned out every day and reports that the kitchen has been modernised with conveyor belts to deliver the laddus from the kitchen to the counter and so forth, what harm would a public health scrutiny possibly do? The Tirupati laddu got a Geographical Indication tag in 2009, and is thus protected from misuse of name or recipe.In Ibsens play, a doctor is asked to inspect the public baths, which is key to the progress of the town. When he finds the water contaminated and refuses to say otherwise, he is declared an enemy of the people. The play ends with the lead character Dr. Stockmann proclaiming that the strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone.Theres a grain of truth in that actually, in Ibsens belief that the minority is always right... its the fools who form the overwhelming majority, Ray had told Andrew Robinson ( Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye ) before he began shooting Ganashatru . Democracy here [India] is very much like that... democracy is an admirable thing in principle but on occasions the situation in An Enemy of the People does occur in actual life.An uncomfortable truthHaving said that, was Ray comfortable with this anti-democratic stance in Ibsens play? Well, no. In fact, the film ends with a small group of young people taking up the protest against the temple from where the good doctor had left off. The doctor had just been out-shouted by his brother at a public meeting he had called to share with the people his fear of an epidemic. His faith is questioned again and again just because he has raised an uncomfortable truth. Do you call yourself a Hindu, his brother asks him. Even when the doctor says yes, its not enough. The brother attacks him: Have you visited our temple in the last ten years? To this the doctor says no. Dont you believe in such rituals? The doctor, trying to remain calm, replies: I do not follow certain customs of Hinduism. Science has shaped my beliefs.... It has been proved that the temple water is infected... it is a question of hygiene, not religion.Raising the religion flagIf we hear our democratic discourse today, the voice of rationality appears to get lost in the din of religious fervour/nationalism/patriotism. Too many people believe in what George W. Bush also once famously said: Youre either with us or against us. But if anyone can be expected to be rational and logical in this, it is perhaps the TTD, which introduced effective crowd-control measures long back and is constantly upgrading technology  the kitchen is solar-powered, the coupon for laddus has a security code with biometric details, packaging has improved to ensure laddus stay fresh longer. Getting an FSSAI licence of safety seems like an obvious thing to do till the religion flag  the laddus are holy and hence cannot be defined as food  is raised and we run the risk of drowning a sane voice. The Tirupati temple trust feeds more than a lakh of devotees each day, why not use science to tick the all-important check box of hygiene?Sudipta Datta is a Kolkata-based journalist.Democracy is an admirable thing in principle but on occasions the situation in An Enemy of the People does o ccur in actual life -Satyajit Ray"

58e4ac67a3d24b281b101204,How green is your papaya?,http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/How-green-is-your-papaya/article16644593.ece,2016-11-17,"A guest from Europe was quite fascinated by the papaya tree in my garden. Not just because it was a tropical tree, but also because the fruit when available was rather expensive in his part of the world. That set me thinking about how we are blessed with papaya trees that grow so easily. Most of the papaya trees at my home arent even planted, but just an outcome of natures seed dispersal system.I was not very fond of papaya as a fruit. But not any more and it is one of my favourites. The ripe red papaya with a squeeze of lemon is just delicious for breakfast. Lately, I have also been enjoying the unripe papaya.I know what you must be thinking; green papaya salad . Yes,I cannot deny that the classic som tum is a delicious salad, but I am talking of a green papaya poriyal that is just as easy to make as a cabbage poriyal and tastes even better. In fact, folks who cant tolerate the full bodied aroma of ripe papaya often find it immensely palatable in its green form.The texture of the green papaya allows a myriad possibilities. It can be eaten raw, steamed, lightly stir fried or blanched.A friend got me this really cool hand held shredder that shreds thin strips off vegetables that are firm. Thanks to that Ive begun experimenting more with the green papaya. Its easy to get thin,translucent noodle like strands when using the fine peeler. Not only does it look appetizing but also adds to the final taste of the dish. Even slicing thin shavings with a regular vegetable peeler works as well.The milky liquid when you cut into the unripe papaya needs to be washed off thoroughly before the flesh can be consumed. Its also at this stage when the seeds are still pale globules that the enzymatic and anti-oxidant properties are at the optimum. As the sugars develop when the fruit ripens ,the enzymes decrease gradually.All that I have cooked with the green papaya have turned out well. The trick is in keeping the flavours simple and fresh. Cucumber, green mango, lime, ripe red chillies, lemon, onions, mint, coriander, coconut, peanuts, micro greens, sprouts, soy sauce, green beans, sugar and fish sauce marry beautifully with the green papaya. Once grated it does let out a fair bit of water, so the best way to avoid that is to steam it or blanch it for a few minutes in boiling salted water.Due to its inherent digestive properties, green papaya paste has been used for centuries as a meat tenderizer. That paste can also be incorporated to add a boost of nutrition to say cutlets, dips or sauces. We really should look more closely at what grows around us. Including native foods into our culinary experiments is truly the way forward. The green papaya is available throughout the year. Why dont we take advantage of that?"
58e4adcba3d24b1c91ede8be,Sweetening sugar’s bitter truth,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Sweetening-sugar%E2%80%99s-bitter-truth/article16940502.ece,2016-12-25,"The industry-funded review comes as health authorities around the world are increasingly taking steps to curb the amount of sugar people consume. PHOTO: SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTSpecial ArrangementA prominent medical journal on Monday published a scathing attack on global health advice to eat less sugar. Warnings to cut sugar, the study argued, are based on weak evidence and cant be trusted.But the review, published in The Annals of Internal Medicine , quickly elicited sharp criticism from public health experts because the authors have ties to the food and sugar industries.The review was paid for by the International Life Sciences Institute, a scientific group based in Washington DC, that is funded by multinational food and agrochemical companies including Coca-Cola, General Mills, Hersheys, Kelloggs, Kraft Foods and Monsanto.Mirrors tobacco industrys tacticsCritics say the medical journal review is the latest in a series of efforts by the food industry to shape global nutrition advice by supporting prominent academics who question the role of junk food and sugary drinks in causing obesity, Type 2 diabetes and other health problems.A report in September showed that those efforts began in the 1960s when the sugar industry paid scientists to cast doubt on the link between sugar and heart disease and promote saturated fat as the culprit instead. More recently, The New York Times found that Coca-Cola had been funding scientists who played down the connection between sugary drinks and obesity.Some experts said the Annals review appeared to be an attempt by the industry to undermine sugar guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other health groups that urge children and adults to consume fewer products with added sugar such as soft drinks, candy and sweetened cereals. The paper, they say, is reminiscent of tactics once used by the tobacco industry, which, for decades, enlisted scientists to become merchants of doubt about the health hazards of smoking.This comes right out of the tobacco industrys playbook: cast doubt on the science, says Dr. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who studies conflicts of interest in nutrition research. This is a classic example of how industry funding biases opinion. Its shameful.The defenceBut the scientists behind the paper said more scrutiny of sugar guidelines was needed. The researchers reviewed guidelines issued by the WHO and eight other agencies around the world and said the case against sugar was based on low-quality evidence.The conclusion of our paper is a very simple one, says Bradley C. Johnston, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Toronto and McMaster University and the lead author of the new paper. We hope that the results from this review can be used to promote improvement in the development of trustworthy guidelines on sugar intake.Dr. Johnston says he recognised that his paper would be criticised because of its ties to industry funding. But he said he hoped people would not throw the baby out with the bathwater by dismissing the conclusion that sugar guidelines should be developed with greater rigour. He also emphasised that he was not suggesting that people eat more sugar. The review article, he said, questions specific recommendations about sugar, but should not be used to justify higher intake of sugary foods and beverages.WHO directiveThe industry-funded review comes as health authorities around the world are increasingly taking steps to curb the amount of sugar people consume. Last year, WHO said adults and children should restrict their intake of sugar from most foods  other than fruit, vegetables and milk  to 10 per cent of their daily calories. WHO said it relied on the latest scientific evidence, which showed that adults and children consuming a lot of sugar were more likely to gain weight or become obese.In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has promised new labelling rules that require food companies to disclose added sugars. Recently, six local governments approved taxes on soft drinks. And in Britain, the health agency, Public Health England, called for strict limits on daily sugar intake.The Annals review gave poor ratings to all the sugar guidelines it evaluated, saying the quality of the evidence they were based on was low to very low. It said that the guidelines were generally not transparent about how the recommendations were reached, and that most of them failed to include disclosures about potential conflicts of interest among their authors.Dr. Christine Laine, editor-in-chief of The Annals of Internal Medicine , defended the journals decision to publish the industry-funded review. She said in an interview that the journal made decisions based on the quality of the research, not the source of funding.  New York Times News Service"

Officers were also able to pay for the cutting and transportation, labour and other costs. While the factory had paid a major portion of the price to farmers, the rest was due. Logistics and other charges had remained unpaid.A Statewide agitation by farmers organisations forced the government to take over the unsold sugar stocks and pay arrears after selling them.Acting on government orders, officials in Bidar had seized around 48,000 quintals of sugar from the factory for delaying payments to farmers. Officers sold the sugar in three lots of 10,000, 700 and 37,000 quintals over a period of six months. The last lot was bought by government agencies over NCDEX.Officers of the Food and Civil Supplies Department deposited Rs 11.87 crore in the accounts of 5,153 farmers three days ago.We got the best price of Rs. 3,495, which is more than what we could get in the local market as we used the NCDEX platform, said Anurag Tewari, Deputy Commissioner. I have reasons to believe Bidar is the only district to have sold sugar on NCDEX. We are also the first district to pay off all arrears of farmers who supplied sugarcane to cooperative factories, he said. He had advised officers to follow this route for all similar transactions in future.The district administration had used the NCDEX platform to sell sugar and pay off cane suppliers dues in September. It was slowed down due to the heavy rains and resultant crop damage. But we have now picked up pace, Mr. Tewari said."

The windows of the Baba household bore the brunt of the clashes which erupted between security forces and protesters.But Nousheen is eager to put the painful year behind her and even manages a shy smile. As a warren of houses in the highly congested Narwara locality in downtown Srinagar greets the eye, a tiny silhouette in a shiny grey cover makes its presence felt in the small courtyard of the Babas. Beneath the cover is the familys first motor-driven two-wheeler. Courtesy Iqra, a Bachelor of Commerce student at the same college her elder sister goes to, who was rewarded by the State government for securing 85 per cent marks in her Class XII exam. Its our first scooter in the family. We are all learning to drive it, says Iqras father Mushtaq Baba, a weaver. The Scooty is Nousheens constant companion too ever since Iqra brought it home nearly two months ago. From college to market, to visiting her friends, it is her lifeline to a future she dreams about.Dreams on wheelsIn the first phase of the two-wheeler scheme, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti handed over the keys to 450 scooters to graduation-level students of Government College for Women, Nawakadal and Government Womens College, Baramulla on November 6. Only meritorious students whose family income is under Rs.4 lakh per annum are eligible for the scheme, which is being extended to all degree colleges of the State. In Jammu, 300 scooters were handed over to eligible students.Mufti sees the Scooty as a game changer in improving the education of girl children who come from economically weaker sections. I have lived a common mans life and gone to college on a bus. I know the difficulties women face while using public transport. You feel it is safe sitting next to an old man, till he starts nudging you in the elbow; the unwelcome attention can be harrowing for any woman, says Mufti, explaining the rationale behind her scheme. She recalls a young woman she spotted riding a scooter in Srinagar earlier this year while on her way to the State Assembly. This girl was short and slim but it was her confidence that was striking. The idea took shape right there. We took the decision to bear 50 per cent of the cost of the bike, she says.The government has dovetailed many Central schemes meant for women empowerment to provide these scooters. I wish I had one and could ride it freely. A girl who owns a Scooty now will never have to request her brother or father to go places. The two-wheelers give women a sense of control of things, says the Chief Minister, adding, Women are the first casualty of violence. Investments must be made to empower women.Iqra, for one, feels empowered, never mind the taunts of the local boys as she drives past: The two-wheeler has earned me azadi (freedom) enough to go to tuitions late in the evening. Five km away from the Baba household, Nargis Rasool, the eldest of four sisters and a brother, borrowed money to avail the Scooty scheme. My father treats me like my brothers equal now since I started driving the Scooty. It is like taking part in a revolution. Though many elders did object to my driving saying how can a girl ride a Scooty on the street?, my parents supported me, says Nargis, a final-year Arts student of Government College for Women, Maulana Azad Road. Her 90-plus percentage in the Class XII exam helped this civil services aspirant to bring the first-ever vehicle to the Rasool household, a family of shawl weavers. Nargis has become an inspiration for the extended family, including six female cousins. Their parents are now forcing them to study hard to secure a Scooty on merit, she says.Reviving an old craftNamda, a carpet made through the process of felting by hand, needs both muscle and money. For Arifa Jan, 31, who completed in 2010 her Craft Management Entrepreneurs Leadership Programme from the Craft Development Institute, Srinagar, the challenge was to turn around the fortune of this dying craft at a time when exports of the once-world-famous Kashmiri carpet had plummeted. According to a government survey, the total production of handicrafts rose to Rs.1,614.59 crore by 2008 against Rs.200 crore in 1990-91 but Namda exports had gone down 97 per cent and amounted to less than Rs.40 lakh annually.The use of cancer-causing dyes and poor cotton mix pushed Namda to the verge of extinction, says Arifa. She infused science and healthy processes back into the craft to make it market-friendly. In 2010, she had to brave prolonged curfew spells to reach her unit to weave the first-ever assignment of 300 Namdas, meant for an exhibition in New Delhi by Dastkar, an NGO working with craftspeople across India.Eight-five per cent of my Namdas were sold. I still remember the taunts of a German buyer who kept saying we were producing fake Namdas, says Arifa, who credits an unknown buyer from Delhi for her first brush with success. The buyer later turned out to be Gulshan Nanda of the Crafts Council of India. Nanda reposed faith in Arifa and the money flowed. Ms. Nanda would come to me and ask serious questions about the craft, says Arifa.In 2013, the Crafts Council of India selected Arifa for a trip to Kyrgyzstan to study their processes of carpet-making. Back home, she scouted for an Australian merino sheep hybrid that was introduced in the Valley in the 1960s. Its wool is what goes into exquisite Namdas, she says.For the first time, Arifa introduced pre-processes to weed out hazardous particulates from the wool and ensured no cancer-causing dyes make their way into it. Even artisans whod make chain stitches on the carpet used to complain of chest pain earlier due to the use of synthetic ingredients, she says.The daughter of a retired State Road Transport Corporation employee, Arifa is now eyeing business opportunities in the U.S. even as her stable has expanded to 27 artisans, 17 of them women. I am rooted in Kashmiri art and culture. I want wages and artworks of women to shift to a competitive level. Artisans have suffered a lot in Kashmir  we have to bring them on a par with sellers, she says.Weaving a new formulaIts 4.30 p.m. The rolling wooden bobbins with multi-coloured fine threads and the neatly thrown over-and-under shuttles meant for woofs and warps are showing no signs of the days tiredness. Bollywood music from the 1980s breaks the monotony of the shuttles at work. Its the first loom in Kashmir where a woman is at the helm, and an attempt is underway to replicate the famous floating garden on Dal lake, Char Chinari, as a design relief from traditional motifs in Kani shawls, a fine handwoven mix of pashmina and shahtoosh wools. We have developed a new formula for shawls. No one can steal it. Its original and a major departure from the past. My work drives my clients to my loom  I have requests pending from many exporters, says Shaheena Akhtar, 31. Like Arifa, Shaheena, a resident of Srinagars Nowshera area, too comes from a humble weavers family, but in just five years, she is being credited with giving a new identity to the Kani shawl, picking up the States Best Entrepreneur award along the way three years ago.Shaheenas journey to finding acceptability in markets in Italy, Germany and Dubai has been anything but easy. Not everyone treats you as a daughter or a sister when you start something like a shawl business. My character was questioned because I used to meet officials. I struggled to have bank guarantors because my father was just a small-time weaver. It was not easy to raise money, she recalls.Following a training stint at the Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Pampore, in 2011, Shaheena was able to start with an initial investment of Rs.8 lakh. In a year she counted her first one lakh rupees in earnings. My father had never counted Rs.1 lakh at a time. I am good at counting money. But that Rs.1 lakh was something I could not count for a while. A girl from Kashmir, counting money, and all the men around looking in awe. A strange feeling seeped in, she recalls. As business grew, she enlisted her brothers help. Of the 18 workers at the loom, 12 are relatives. I am proud that in such a short span I have a turnover of Rs.1 crore, she says.Roh-i-Kashmir (Soul of Kashmir), Shaheenas company, has tie-ups with six major exporters for the 60-70 shawls her loom produces annually. My thrust is quality. My shawl sells for Rs.4.5 lakh in the international market for its intricate and exquisite work. It takes more than nine months and two labourers to finish one intricately woven Kani shawl, Shaheena adds.An English tea room in SrinagarHistorically, Kashmir has drawn its taste buds from Central Asia, including the famous kahwah (a traditional green tea preparation) and multi-cuisine wazwan . Roohi Nazki, a former employee with Tata Interactive Systems, is trying to get Kashmiris hooked on something very different: the tea room. Its been worth the effort, if increasing footfalls at her small joint, Chai Jai  modelled after tea rooms in England  are anything to go by.It was a solo holiday trip to England in 2013 that changed Roohis life and introduced her to the niceties of tea rooms. In the Cotswolds villages of south-central England she saw mirror images of the Kashmir Valley. Moving back to the Valley after living in Mumbai for 22 years, Roohis parents initially persuaded her to stay on in a corporate job, but she just knew what she wanted to do next.As one walks down the British-era manicured embankment of the Jhelum river in Srinagars Polo View area, Roohis little England, complete with castle-room interiors and cobblestone floors, is hard to miss in the age-old Mahatta Building.Launched in July this year, Roohi is reviving teas from bygone times like Daam Tyooth (a herbal tea), Bunafshan tea (flower tea), Qadri tea (a herbal tea with sugar mix), Nettle tea and Gulkand kahwah (mix of saffron and sun-dried rose petals). I have 28 varieties as of now and I am working on a collection of 200 varieties, she says.Small steps to giant stridesWhile it is too early to see these women as enduring successes, having a woman Chief Minister at the helm seems to have given a fresh impetus to a more inclusive society in a State which has primarily been in the news this year for its mind-numbing violence. A slew of measures initiated by Chief Minister Mufti  including reservation of 10 per cent land in industrial estates for women entrepreneurs, the Ladli Beti scheme aimed at the economically poor, an all-woman entrepreneurs market, all-woman buses and all-woman police stations  are aimed at women.The opposition National Conference spokesperson Sarah Hayat Shah acknowledges that every step towards empowerment of women is always appreciable, but simultaneously points out the troubled ground reality in Kashmir where even young girls have been killed or blinded in the wave of protests since July. I am afraid the scooters may not be able to heal the wounds, she says.Ultimately, beyond the overhang of violence, a lot of the contestations with patriarchy are essentially atomic. Every time I watch a fisherwoman of Srinagar, I can see her making her own rules as she negotiates her space and life, says Roohi, now in her 40s.Just like she fights her own little everyday battles, such as taking trolls  who were outraged at her bringing a feel of Christmas to Chai Jai with cakes and candies from Mumbai  off her Twitter feed, one resolute click at a time.I am rooted in Kashmiri art and culture. I want wagesand artworks of women to shift to a competitive level.Arifa Jan, 31Owner, carpet manufacturing unitpHoto: V. V.

Vinod Kumar has stressed the need for Prime Minister Narendra Modi convening a meeting of the Chief Ministers on the demonetisation of higher denomination currency notes to deal with unprecedented economic crisis and social fallout being increasingly felt by day across the country.The MP said in a statement that the Chief Minister was necessary to provide the States a platform to voice their concerns arising out of the Centre's move and also to know the problems being faced by people. A dialogue on the issue would also give the Centre an opportunity to address and assuage these concerns and fears being expressed by several State governments. The brunt of any unpleasant fallout of the move aimed at taking out about 86 per cent of the currency notes in circulation would directly fall upon the State Governments since law and order was a State subject.In the circumstances, it was the prerogative of the Centre to apprise the States of the current situation and the steps being taken to restore normalcy in money supply.He expressed fears that if the supply of new currency notes was not expeditiously restored by taking adequate measures, the demonetisation drive could snowball into a financial emergency. With new notes and lower denomination currency not penetrating the markets, the situation can exacerbate, leading to panic and anxiety in the public and there have already been several instances of hoarding of essential commodities like salt and sugar in some States, because of fear, he pointed out.It could also lead to a serious law and order crisis and the State Governments must be adequately prepared to face any such unwarranted situation, he suggested."

58e4b0bfa3d24b1c91edeaa2,Twin states split on diabetes test meter,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/twin-states-split-on-diabetes-test-meter/articleshow/56150263.cms,2016-12-24,"HYDERABAD: Are you a diabetic? Your fate hinges on which of the three regions in AP and Telangana you hail from. If you are a Rayalaseema native, you are declared diabetic , if your glycated blood reading (HbA1c) is above 6.3.But you need not panic till your reading crosses 6.5, if you are a Hyderabadi or from Telangana. Globally, the common cut-off limit for blood sugar average over a period of eight weeks is 6.5. Doctors in India also follow the Western parameter of 6.5 to affirm diabetic status.Doctors and researchers from AP and Telangana are now split over the cut-off mark for the HbA1c test. The immediate trigger for debate in the medical fraternity in the twin states is a research study published by doctors from Tirupati, making 6.3 as the cut-off.Research covering all four districts of Rayalaseema appeared in the latest issue of the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR) published by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country's premier medical research body .In last 10 years, HbA1C emerged as a reliable test to determine diabetes and doctors now prefer this test over traditional fasting and post-lunch blood sugar tests. While many doctors accept the universal standard of 6.5 cut off mark, researchers from Rayalaseema argue there should not be one HbA1c parameter for all populations. They said it differs from regions to ethnic groups. The debate assumes importance in backdrop of rising diabetes cases in AP and Telangana. The cut-off mark is important as patients will be put to unnecessary or wrong medication that can cause health complications. The research team from Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, Sri Venkateswara University and Harshitha Hospital, Tirupati, and Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, said validity of HbA1c needs to be established in ethnic populations.Even within AP and Telangana, people have different lifestyles and food habits. For instance, people in the Godavari, Krishna and Guntur districts consume more rice, com pared to people in rural Telangana and Rayalaseema, where jowar, wheat and millets are popular. In Hyderabad, lack of exercise and rapid urbanisation have taken a heavy toll.Speaking to TOI, Dr Harikishan Boorugu , consultant physician, Apollo hospitals , said, ""Several fac tors like age, ethnicity and genetic makeup of people influence HbA1c results. The test may be different for same sugar level in different countries and different ethnic populations. There are studies from various countries which looked at optimal HbA1c cutoff for diagnosing diabetes. The level fixed for Rayalaseema can be ap plied to people in Telangana and coastal Andhra. But 6.3 limit is not endorsed by the Indian Endocrinology Association ,"" he said.""The 6.5 mark or above is recommended as cut off mark for diagnosing diabetes, although a value less than 6.5 does not exclude diabetes using glucose tests,"" said consultant endocrinologist Dr Ravi Shankar Erukulapati.Another endocrinologist Dr Sridevi Paladugu suggests there should be research studies on local populations in different regions to decide on a cut-off.However, Dr Aftab Ahmed, specialist in internal medicine, points out that as risk of micro-vascular and cardio-vascular disease starts when HbA1c is between 5.7 and 6.4, one should follow a strict lifestyle regime if diagnosed as pre-diabetic.Senior consultant in internal medicine Dr Y Ganesh said diversity of Indian population said, ""We need many population-based studies to confirm whether we can have different HbA1c values for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana."""

It would also seek to educate the farmers on ways and means for economic use of fertilizers. More importantly, the length of the cane, the length of the nodes and inter nodes also increase appreciably, said R. Chandrasekaran, Professor and Head of the Station.He said that water efficiency would be about 30 to 40 per cent over the conventional irrigation practices. Since drip irrigation is also used for supplying fertilizer, the entire quantum of fertilizer is fully utilised for cane growth. In the conventional method, much of the fertilizer is lost into the earth, he said.Spacing and mechanisationThe major advantage of drip irrigation is that it ensures adequate spacing which, in turn prevents the growth of weeds in the sugarcane field. Even in case of weed growth, they can be cleared mechanically. Further, the wide space available would facilitate mechanised harvest process.Many sugarcane farmers have been visiting the Kendra for an exposure to the technique.

Against this backdrop, farmers have accused the State government of leniency towards the mills while being harsh on the cultivators.Since 2013 when the Rangarajan Committee Recommendations were released, mills have been of the opinion that the Central government intends to do away with the SAP.One of the recommendations of the committee was to scrap the SAP at the first stage and share 70 per cent of the combined sold value of sugar, molasses, bagasse and press mud at the second stage. But, the mills had chosen to keep the second stage requirement under wraps while studiously refusing to pay the SAP, a representative of a farmers association said.At a time when sugar is sold in excess of Rs. 40 per kg in the open market, the decision to keep the procurement cost stagnant was ridiculous, according to K.V. Ponnaiyan, president of Tamil Nadu Swadeshi Farmers Movement.The governments silence over the Rs. 1,500-crore payment backlog on account of SAP arrears (to be paid by mills to farmers) over the last three years was intriguing, Mr. Ponnaiyan said.However, Palani G. Periasamy, president of South India Sugar Mills Association, said the private sugar mills in the State had incurred loss to the tune of Rs. 13,500 crore in the last three years and were finding it difficult to pay even the FRP. The sugar prices were up only for the last three or four months and this would not address the fundamental problems faced by the industry. We are asking the government to convene a tripartite meeting and bring in a revenue-sharing model. Cane availability is poor this year and sugar production is expected to decline by 33 per cent. Under these circumstances, we appeal to the government to introduce and implement a revenue-sharing system, he said.(With inputs from M. Soundariya Preetha in Coimbatore)"

Prior to withdrawing amount, the bank requested Mr. George to furnish the documents to prove that the exports had already been done.ED notifiedThe fraud came to light when the Customs Department found that the document submitted by the exporter was forged. The Customs officials found that no material had been shipped. But since the money had already been withdrawn the Customs officials decided to refer the matter to the ED, an ED official said.Accounts frozenThe ED also found that some of the export documents submitted by the firm carried a forged seal of the Customs Department. Based on the finding, it has frozen all the accounts to which the money was transferred.Meanwhile, preliminary investigations revealed that Trade International had executed just one export contract  that of exporting sunflower oil to Iraq during the whole year. It entered into a deal with the Bulgarian company during the same period.Figures do not matchWith the law of the land permitting overseas sales of cooking oils in small packs of up to 5 kg for a year with a limit of 20,000 tonnes, the volume of sunflower oil as specified in this particular export agreement could not be executed by any exporter in the country, he added.Though the ED had approached officials of the Bulgarian company seeking more details about the export contract, the company has refused to cooperate with the investigation.The importer is not willing to lodge a complaint, raising suspicion that the money had been sent for some other purpose in the cover of an export deal, officials added.As part of investigation, ED inspected the office of Mr. George in Elamakkara and recorded his and his relatives statements.Mr. George told the media that the allegations levelled against him were false and the government agencies were moving against him with some vested interests."

Pollution Control Board (APPCB) will soon launch an app to know the pollution levels of Red category industries in the State, its member-secretary B.S.S. Prasad has said.The pollution monitoring stations in such industries would be linked to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and APPCB websites, Mr. Prasad said.The app is expected to be launched in about three weeks so that people can see for themselves the pollution levels in various industries by using it.He was interacting with the media after inaugurating a two-day workshop on New Waste Management Rules 2016, being organised by the board here on Wednesday.The CPCB categorises industrial sectors having pollution index score of 60 and above as Red category.Quoting the example of Visakhapatnam Port Trust, he said it had been asked to set up three monitoring stations with a cost of Rs.3 crore.Upon linking the stations to the websites, people would be able to see what the suspended particulate matter (SPM) level was by using the app, he said.The same is possible for HPCL or Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, or other industries. The carbon dioxide or nitrogen dioxide levels can be seen on the app, he said.The pollution in the port was not as much as it was before as a number of steps were taken, he said.Online monitoringMr. Prasad said that monitoring of pollution in industries shifted online with web cameras and stack monitoring. Units were being given time to set up web monitoring. To industries not installing the equipment, closure or cut in production notices were being issued.The CPCB had issued several notices and, of late, sugar factories were also served notices, he said.Without any connection with the PCB, 50 teams, with officials of the Industries Department, the CPCB, and the Ministry of Environment, from Chennai were inspecting establishments on computer-based random selection basis, he said.The officials had to give report online within 48 hours and there could not be any nexus as none would go to the unit for a second time, the member-secretary said.With such process, regional and zonal offices also could not exert any influence in the name of jurisdiction, he added."

Veera Raghava Rao on Thursday.Officials said that in this season it had been proposed to crush roughly 2.6 lakh tonnes of sugarcane. Of these, roughly 1.6 lakh tonnes will be from the 5,687 acres of land already registered with the mill by farmers. The remaining one lakh tonne sugarcane for crushing will be taken from the mills in Perambalur and Thanjavur.The target is slightly higher than the 2.38 lakh tonne of sugarcane crushed in the last season, from which 2.06 lakh quintals of sugar was produced.Collector Rao said that cane cutting instructions had already been sent to all the areas coming under the mills jurisdiction and urged the farmers to ensure steady supply of cane for crushing so that the mills efficiency could be maintained at a higher level, leading to better earnings for farmers.He said that the price fixed by the State government for a tonne of sugarcane would be provided to farmers. He said that the mill would also bear the transportation cost for bringing the sugarcane."

This included healthy diet, exercises, foot care, heart and eye care.Gestational diabetes is one of the important problems in pregnant women. Twenty per cent of women in Tamil Nadu have gestational diabetes. Within five years, 50 per cent of them develop type 2 diabetes. This is a huge number of young women who develop type 2 diabetes, Nihal Thomas, professor and head, Unit-I, Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, CMC, said.When this group is targeted with diabetes education such as on appropriate diet and exercise, it pays a lot, as a woman could make all the difference to a family, he added.If a pregnant woman has uncontrolled sugar, there are chances that the baby is big. The risk of this child growing to become a diabetic later in life is also much large. Hence, women should keep the sugar level under control during pregnancy, Dr. Thomas added.Doctors say that gestational diabetes can cause malformation of the foetus, bigger baby resulting in difficult delivery. Other departments too have joined hands in putting up stalls at the exhibition. This included departments of cardiology, physiotherapy, dietetics, ophthalmology and prosthetics and orthotic services.So what is the route to control diabetes? It is through eating healthy, being active and thinking positive, explains the stall on diabetes education. The stall of the physiotherapy department points out that physical activity was like magic for type 2 diabetes and can improve blood glucose control.Preventing cardiovascular diseases in diabetes was the focus of the stall put up by the Cardiology department. Techniques of proper foot care were taught to patients at the foot care stall, while fundus examination was done for patients and prevention of retinopathy explained at the ophthalmology stall.The dietary stall showcased cereals, pulses and vegetables that constituted healthy eating and foods that should be avoided. One of the highlights of the stall was one dish meal that combined all kinds of food groups in one dish such as Chola rava upma and Thinai pulao.A cooking demonstration of simple recipes for diabetics and puppet show on diabetes management was also part of the exhibition.A mini camp was also held to screen people.

Five hundred farmers and representatives of five sugar mills, including three from Maharashtra, participated in the meeting. While the sugar mills from the State offered a maximum of Rs. 2,000 a tonne, those from Maharashtra offered up to Rs. 2,500. But, the farmers were persistent on Rs. 2,700, he said.Reasonable demandMr. Kulkarni reasoned that Rs. 2,700 a tonne was very reasonable, considering the amount of sugar produced from a tonne of sugarcane and the better sugar price in the market. By crushing a tonne of sugarcane, 110 kg of sugar, worth Rs. 4,180, can be produced. The mills can earn money by selling the by-products as well. Our demand of Rs. 2,700 is reasonable, he said.Mr. Kulkarni demanded that the Deputy Commissioner intervene in the issue by calling a meeting of cane growers and sugar mill owners.He also said sugarcane growers were reluctant to sell their produce to mills in Maharashtra, considering the payment and transportation issues. Maharashtrabased mills are trying to lure sugarcane growers in Kalaburagi by offering a little more than the mills in Karnataka. They are also giving written undertakings to buy the crop for the next three years at the market rate. But our farmers are reluctant as they may have to suffer in the event of crop loss during transportation and delay in payment, he said.Terming the Gulbarga Electricity Supply Companys arrangement of supplying power to rural areas for four hours during the day and three during the night as an inconvenience, Mr. Kulkarni demanded for continuous three-phase power supply for seven hours.

On November 18, when she came in, she was told that she would require a C-section and that there was also a cyst, said Ms.Nasrath.On Sunday, when Haseena had stomach pain, she went to a private clinic in Vandavasi, where she was told that there was no baby, but there was a cyst.On Monday, when she came to Kasturba Gandhi Hospital with continued pain, she was told that there was no baby. We were also told that sometimes patients convince themselves they are pregnant and can even have some signs, said Ms. Nasrath. This was to be the couples first baby, she said.Haseena had earlier undergone surgery at the hospital for the removal of a cyst. Haseena, who was very upset, said it had been a huge shock.Director in charge of the hospital S. Vijaya said Haseena, who had polycystic ovarian syndrome, had been coming to the hospital for infertility treatment. In January, after a scan revealed a cyst in her left ovary, the patient underwent a laproscopic cystectomy. An ultrasound scan on March 28 was normal. On April 11, a urine pregnancy test was weakly positive. We believed she was pregnant and Haseena had been coming for check-ups, where her blood pressure and sugar levels were tested, she said.Haseena should have undergone an ultrasound scan in her fourth month, but somehow this was missed, Dr. Vijaya said. She did not come in September and there is a chance that in August or October she possibly did not go into the scan room or did not wait for the scan, she said.There should have been an early scan done for her. Something has been missed somewhere, said another doctor. We will definitely look into it and rectify the lacuna, said Dr. Vijaya.Ms. Haseena, however, said that she had undergone scans at the hospital, at least twice. Members of the family gathered at the hospital on Tuesday afternoon and were asking doctors for an explanation.The hospital said it was now planning to admit Haseena, give her medication and monitor her further. The doctors mentioned pseudocyesis, a rare condition in which a woman believes she is pregnant and may even have symptoms, when she is not."

Photo: Gopichand T.The demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes has hit the rural population hard, especially daily wage agricultural labourers.With land-owners short of valid notes, the workers are forced to either accept demonetised notes and later get them exchanged in banks, skipping a days work, or agree to indefinite delays in payments.We worked in fields of various farmers in our village for one week. But, nobody paid us as they too are facing shortage of valid currency notes. As a result, our debts in grocery shops and other establishments have risen. Then, we had to accept the demonetised notes, which we were able to exchange at a bank, skipping a days work, Satyappa, an agricultural labourer from Bapur village of Raichur district, told The Hindu .The condition of farmers are no better. They dont have enough valid currency to pay labourers as they have not received payment from traders who bought their crops.I sold 10 quintals of red gram, but received no payment yet. The traders, who purchased the crop, are telling me to accept demonetised currency notes or to wait. We are finding it difficult to pay the dues to labourers and traders from whom I had bought farm inputs, Amaranna Gowda Patil, a farmer from Kodekal village in Yadgir district said.Kalesh, a farmer from Hanchinal village in Jewargi taluk, Kalaburagi district, who owns 20 acres of rain-fed lands and doesnt have a bank account, shared his problems of paying the labourers he employed for cotton harvesting.I am finding it difficult to face labourers who are coming everyday for payments. They usually dont demand their wages often as we pay them once a week. Since they too are facing similar problem of lack of valid currency, they are coming to my home hoping wages, he said.Reduced demandVillages, particularly smaller hamlets predominantly inhabited by labourers community such as Lambani tandas, are facing a reduced demand for labour.Normally, farmers and sugar factory managers come to these settlements and book groups of labourers or cane cutting gangs in the first week of November.But no one has come to our tanda till now, said Amrut Lal, a Lambani farm labourer from Seva Lal tanda near Bidar, who, with his family, usually go for cane harvesting in Khanapur, Malchapur and nearby villages every year.Issue of changeThose who managed to exchange their demonetised currency and got wages in Rs. 2,000 notes are facing the problem spending it as grocery shops and other smaller establishments are refusing to accept the big notes for smaller bills.Shopkeepers either dont accept the notes for small bills. Even if they do, they ask us to keep taking rations till the amount is exhausted, Ramanagouda, a farm labourer from Sangankal village in Ballari taluk, said.Fallen pricesIt has also caused the fall of prices of farm produces.Cotton traders in Jewargi and Kalaburagi were ready to purchase my crop, but would pay in Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. When I demanded Rs. 100 notes, they asked me to sell the crop at reduced rate. The normal rate is Rs. 5,500 a quintal but I will have to sell at Rs. 4,500 a quintal if I want to get payment in Rs. 100 notes, Mr. Kalesh, told The Hindu .Raju, a progressive farmer from Shankarbanda village of Ballari taluk, shared a similar experience.If we take our harvested chilli crop to the market, the trader would seek three months time to repay or ask to sell the crop at a reduced rate owing to want of valid currency, he said.(With inputs from Rishikesh Bahadur Desai in Bidar, M.

Mahadev Prasad and the State government toward the genuine demands of the growers but not taking any decision on them, the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) on Tuesday announced to launch a State-wide agitation in a peaceful manner from Thursday, in view of the alleged failure of the meeting of KRRS leaders with the Minister at the Deputy Commissioners office during the day.KRRS State president Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, working president H.R. Basavarajappa, vice-president Basavaraj Malalli told newsmen in the evening that the government had failed to respond to their genuine demands and used force to prevent farmers coming from different parts of the State to participate in the protest near the Suvarana Vidhana Soudha, where the winter session of the legislature is on since Monday.Soon after the meeting, the Minister left for the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha while the police arrested the farmers and their leaders and shifted them to KSRP Training School premises in Machhe on Jamboti Road on the outskirts of the city, which was an expression of the governments lack of faith in democratic and peaceful protests.The discussions with Sugar Minister, Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda and subsequently with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah last evening turned futile. Mr. Prasad held another meeting at the Deputy Commissioners Office on Tuesday morning but was not forthcoming, which eventually turned out be yet another futile exercise aimed at defusing the farmers agitation.Mr. Malalli said that since the farmers were reeling under severe drought conditions for the third year in a row, the government must come to their rescue and waive entire outstanding crop loans along with interest, besides distributing adequate compensation for crop losses and also pay Rs. 3,500 per tonne of sugarcane this year as the prices of sugar had gone up beyond Rs. 42 per kg in the retail markets.Besides, a majority of the sugar mills were earning additional profits from sugarcane by-products but not sharing it with the supplier of the raw material.Mr. Chandrashekhar said that the agitation was also to pressure the government to find a solution to the protracted Mahadayi water dispute, during the ongoing winter session itself."

An additional amount of Rs. 11 crore has also been released for the remaining works of the mill.The Mysugar Mill is considered to be the lifeline of cane-growers in the district, to facilitate the commencement of sugarcane crushing for the 2017-18 season.Administrative procedures had hindered the pace of the ongoing renovation. The technically validated tests on machines will be conducted in December.The sugar mill will generate electricity through the co-generation unit from August 2017 by procuring bagasse, Mr. Prasad said.Mr. Prasad faced some embarrassing moments while addressing the gathering.ProtestA group of people attempted to disrupt his speech by expressing their unhappiness over the delay in reviving the mill.They said the State government was least bothered about the sugarcane growers. They demanded that the State governments announce a waiver on farm loans.Zero interest loan schemeMeanwhile, the Minister urged small and marginal farmers to use the State governments schemes such as loans and subsidies.The government had issued Rs. 10,400 crores of loans to around 21 lakh farmers in the last three years, he said."

Officers were also able to pay for the cutting and transportation, labour and other costs. While the factory had paid a major portion of the price to farmers, the rest was due. Logistics and other charges had been unpaid.A State-wide agitation by farmers groups forced the government to take over the unsold sugar stocks and pay arrears after selling them.Acting on government orders, officials in Bidar had seized around 48,000 quintals of sugar from the factory for delaying payments to farmers. Officers sold the sugar in three lots of 10,000, 700 and 37,000 quintals over a period of six months. The last lot was bought by government agencies over NCDEX, for distribution through the public distribution system.Officers of the Food and Civil Supplies Department have deposited Rs. 11.87 crore in the accounts of 5,153 farmers three days ago. We got the best price of Rs. 3,495, which is more than what we could get in the local market as we used the NCDEX platform, said Anurag Tewari, Deputy Commissioner.I have reasons to believe Bidar isthe only district to have sold sugar on NCDEX. We are also the first district to pay off all arrears of farmers who supplied sugarcane to cooperative factories, he said.He said that he had advised officers to follow this route for all similar transactions in future. The district administration had used the NCDEX platforms to sell sugar and pay off cane suppliers dues in September."

Farmers of notified revenue villages and notified firkas can participate in this scheme after paying the prescribed premium amount for the notified crops. In case of loanee farmers it is compulsory, but for non-loanee farmers it is voluntary participation.Those who pay the prescribed premium for the notified crops will have the crop insurance coverage for prevented sowing / failed sowing (failed to transplant in case of paddy) and 25 per cent of the insured amount will be paid as compensation to all the premium paid farmers if the sowing did not take place / failed in more than 75 p.c. of the area of that notified revenue village/ firka and the insurance coverage will be ceased after that.However, the insurance coverage will continue in other cases up to the harvest stage and compensation will be calculated based on the yield obtained during the crop cutting experiment in comparison to the five years average yield of that particular crop for that particular village.The additional feature of this scheme is the insurance coverage will be extended for two weeks after the harvest wherein any loss to the harvested product occur due to flood, hurricane, hailstorm and landslides in the local areas will be compensated based on the individual based assessment.In Salem district paddy, ragi, cholam, maize, black gram, cow pea, groundnut, gingelly, banana, tapioca, cotton and sugar cane are the notified crops in the respective notified villages covered under this scheme.

Sunil Kumar said the campaign would seek to dispel the misinformation about coconut oil as bad for health.As a result of the misconceptions spread by a section of doctors and vested interests, a large number of consumers in India switched over to other oils such as sunflower oil and palmoil. On the other hand, other countries rediscovered the health benefits of coconut. Virgin coconut oil is widely used as a raw material in baby food in North America while in Europe, palm sugar made from coconut is gaining popularity as a healthy substitute for refined sugar.Neera in tetrapakThe Minister said the coconut park, to be established in Kozhikode, would offer facilities for production of neera in tetrapak containers.The government, he added, had set aside funds in the Budget to procure technology for value addition of crops and provide it free of cost to producers.Kerala, he said, lagged behind other States and countries in value addition of coconut. Except for coconut oil, the State had little to showcase as a successful coconut-based product.The Minister said the government would bring out a policy to ensure that farmers get their due share of benefit from value addition of crops."

It has also asked banks to consider using mobile vans in the remote, unbanked areas.Banks should, in a camp mode, open accounts for tea/coffee and other plantation workers, employees of sugar cooperatives, dairy firms and such other worker groups with concentrated payment locations so that they may be better served in terms of deposit into accounts and withdrawal therefrom, it said.It reiterated that to cope with the increased work load banks may consider hiring retired employees.

The overpowering aroma of breads and cakes greet visitors to the hotel lobby where the gingerbread house will be kept till December 25. It took five days for a team of five hotel staffs headed by bakery chef Tapas to make the fairytale gingerbread house.
