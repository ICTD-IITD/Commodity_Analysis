Childhood obesity was one of the current global challenges. Anti-Obesity Day is observed on November 26 to promote awareness, she said.Mothers were excessively anxious about nutritional supplements and often overzealous causing childhood obesity themselves. Parents had a big role in children developing the correct relationship with food, Dr. Sushma said. Overweight and obese children tend to get obese in their adulthood and were prone to developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a much younger age.Apart from the underlying medical issues and hormonal imbalances, the two recent culprits of childhood obesity were found to be junk food and sedentary lifestyle, she said.Recalling the case of a four-year-old girl weighing 30 kg, Dr. Sushma said that the child was indulging in junk food with absolutely no physical activity. Since it was not possible to completely change the childs food habits all of a sudden, the cutting down of sugar was prescribed. This meant no-added sugar and no fruit juices, soft drinks, sweets, chocolates and bakery products. In the next phase the childs junk food was replaced with some healthy home-made snacks made out of millets. The home-made snacks included ragi dosa, ragi parantha stuffed with vegetables, pancakes made with jowar flour and upma with bajra rava, among others. The child subsequently lost 2 kg weight and has gone back to her dancing classes that would make her more active and lose more weight, Dr. Sushma said."

Evidently, the Adivasi Gond from Allikhori village in Adilabad mandal, who had come to the weekly shandy at Indervelli mandal headquarters on Monday, was untouched by the ill effects of demonetisation.I am able to 'exchange' my cotton with groceries, he observed revealing the secret behind his withstanding the current monetary crisis generated by the Union governments move to ban the higher denomination currency notes. Yes, it is the good old barter system which has come in handy for Adivasis and traders in Adilabad and Kumram Bheem districts.Cotton saleBetween November and February, the Gond and Kolam Adivasi farmers sell their produce (cotton) in small quantities of 20 kg or 30 kg to petty traders in weekly shandies held at Gudihatnoor, Ichoda, Indervelli, Narnoor, Jainoor and Kerameri. The small amounts realised through such sales are used to purchase groceries, vegetables, tea, sugar and even jowar.Cotton is sold in larger quantities like two or three quintals towards the end of the season when the tribals need money to perform marriages. However, the Rs. 10,000 or Rs. 15,000 realised through such sale being insufficient, the petty trader chips in with his contribution during marriages too. During the initial days of demonetisation, the aboriginal people faced considerable difficulty in selling their produce owing to severe shortage of small notes. The best way out seemed to exchange cotton with groceries, Indervelli kirana shop owner Santosh Chintawar, recalled the days when both sides saw a solution to the cash crunch problem.The amount due after adjusting the price of groceries against the value of cotton which was sold, is paid in cash. Often, these payments are made in the shape of Rs. 10 notes or even in Rs. 5 coins, disclosed a grocer at Kerameri as he talked of the transactions.Cashless economyThe aboriginal people may be better placed at this juncture but they do not seem to be equipped enough to deal with the inevitable cashless economy in future. The Telangana Grameena Bank, which has the largest adivasi customer base in the these districts, has about 60,000 aboriginal farmers as customers in its agency area branches.Not many transact through banks owing to poverty. Only a handful of us have exchanged banned currency notes in banks to date, pointed out a thoughtful Sedmaki Gangaram, the Patel or head man of Allikhori."

You support a good cause, said Signe Skovgaard Sorensen, a student, after picking up a bottle of upscale olive oil for 20 kroner ($2.9).Isnt it great? pensioner Olga Fruerlund said, holding up a jar of sweets that she planned to give to her grandchildren for Christmas.The sweets can last for a hundred years because there is sugar in them, she added.Selling expired food is legal in Denmark as long as it is clearly advertised and there is no immediate danger to consuming it.We look, we smell, we feel the product and see if its still consumable, project leader Bassel Hmeidan said about the venture.All products are donated by producers, import and export companies and local supermarkets, and are collected by Wefoods staff, all of whom are volunteers. The stores profit goes to charity.Half the pricePrices are around half of what they would be elsewhere, but even its biggest fans would struggle to do their weekly shopping here.The products available depend on what is available from donors, resulting in an eclectic mix that changes from day to day.One weekday afternoon, customers were greeted by a mountain of Disney and Star Wars-branded popcorn, while the fresh fruit section had been reduced to a handful of rotting apples.Food waste has become an increasingly hot topic in recent years, with initiatives ranging from a French ban last year on destroying unsold food products, to a global network of cafes serving dishes with food destined for the scrap heap.

They make do with one meal instead of the usual three meals, despite a gruelling 8-10 hours of work daily as landless farm labourers. Even though vegetables, grown around their mud-thatched house, are still available, Ms. Bag and her family have drastically cut back on pulses, salt, flour and oil they buy from the neighbourhood grocer. Because he doesnt extend credit any longer. Chitra cant pay in new currency notes as her employer paid her in old notes.Earlier, the six of us were consuming five kilogram of pulses and 10 kilogram of atta [wheat flour], every month, and about three litres of cooking oil and one kilogram of salt. No longer do we do so, Ms. Bag told this reporter. We are splitting one meal into two as grocers are refusing to give salt, sugar or pulses on credit, Ms Bag said.Nearly all workers, about 30 in number, in the swathes of farmland in the Bhabanipur village of Jamalpur Block, said they were now being refused credit by the neighbourhood grocer. The grocer  a middle-aged man  said he could not extend any more credit as customers were paying in old bank notes.Jamalpur, adjacent to Singur town, on the banks of river Damodar, is known for its rich alluvial soil. But demonetisation has slowed down cultivation at the peak of the sowing season of potato, the main cash crop of Bengal, affecting the earnings of nearly 200,000 farmers and labourers in Jamalpur.According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, about 3,87,000 hectares of land  second only to Uttar Pradesh  was under potato cultivation in 2012. That amounts to five per cent of the States total area. Since Bengals industrial economy is not as healthy as most other States, it depends on agro produce, mainly potato.Ms. Bag  who was last paid for MGNREGA work in May  had little option but to tender old notes as her employer, Chittaranjan Das, a small farmer, did not hand out pay in 100-rupee notes.Mr. Das, like other farmers in rural Bengal, has just sold the harvested kharif crop (paddy) and taken the cash to the cold storage to pay for the potato seeds for the coming season. He found that all the 15 cold storages of Jamalpur had stopped accepting old notes.He told The Hindu that neither could he go to the bank to deposit and withdraw the money as it was a time-consuming affair in the potato sowing season.The potato seeds  which are tubers of the previous year  are preserved in storages by the farmers around March. In November, the storages are paid to take out preserved seed-potatoes, planted and placed in four-inch deep trenches with the help of labourers for harvesting in March. About 1.5 lakh tonnes of potatoes are produced in Jamalpur annually.Crisis timeSince stores stopped taking [old] notes, notes, all in white, are piling up and I had to pay [the labourers] those notes, Mr. Das said. Moreover, November 30 is the last date to withdraw seeds from the cold storages. If the farmers fail to take the seeds out by then, the store owners may destroy the seeds, warned Sheikh Mehruddin, one of the more prosperous farmers. The consequence would be acute shortage of potato in the retail market.We are helplessThe officials of one of the largest stores of Jamalpur  Sethia Cold Storage  accepted that minor scuffles were breaking out. But, like Mr. Das, they pleaded helplessness. We are instructed not to accept old currency notes, an official of Sethia Cold Storage said .Former president of Cold Storage Owners Association Gurupada Sinha held the Central government responsible for the situation. Indicating that it would be difficult for them to hold the stock after November 30, Mr. Sinha said the government should intervene.Realising that the situation is spiralling out of control, the store-owners, merchants federation and Bengals Minister of Agriculture Marketing met on Wednesday.The problem, however, remains unresolved, Baren Mondal, general secretary of the Merchants Association, said. He said they would meet again in the coming week. But if it is not resolved, the lives and livelihood of crores of people in rural Bengal and potato-growing States will be affected, he warned.They are distressed as they do not have new currency to withdraw seeds from cold storage facilities"

Mahadev Prasad has said it is possible to give high prices to growers during the crushing year 2016-17.Speaking to The Hindu soon after a meeting with leaders of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) here, the Minister said it was possible to pay Rs. 200 to Rs.300 per tonne of sugarcane above the current Fair and Remunerative Price of Rs.2,300 per tonne for sugarcane at 9.5 per cent recovery.He said he would convene a meeting with the managements of sugar mills in North Karnataka to take up the growers demand for higher prices and payment of previous dues in Belagavi on Thursday. The farmers were demanding Rs.3,500 per tonne, which included a share from the profits earned from the byproducts by the mills.Mr. Prasad said Karnataka was facing shortage of sugarcane this year for various reasons. As against 376.65 lakh tonnes of sugarcane crushed to produce 40.45 lakh tonnes of sugar last year (2015-16), around 300 lakh tonnes of cane was available this year (2016-17).This shortage situation would further result in fall in sugar production to about 300 lakh tonnes only.Earlier, to a question he told newsmen that there was no difference between the Maharashtra and Karnataka model on sugarcane prices. The only difference was that a few mills were facing shortage of cane in their respective areas were giving higher prices, which could not be bench mark for all other mills to follow.The government had already announced FRP of Rs.2,300 per tonne for cane yielding 9.5 per cent recovery. The prices were higher for every one per cent increase in the recovery. There were around 40 to 45 mills achieving more than 10.5 per cent recovery, which meant that the farmers could get higher prices from these mills as against those achieving 9.5 per cent or less recovery. However, he appealed farmers and their leader for exercising patience and assured of coming out with a decision as per the expectations of the agitating growers."
58e4e64da3d24b281b103768,Release water from reservoirs: farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Release-water-from-reservoirs-farmers/article16713300.ece,2016-11-28,"Farmers have made a fervent plea to the district administration to secure water from hydel reservoirs in The Nilgiris for special wetting of crops in the old and new ayacuts.Farmers put forth the common plea during the monthly grievances redress meeting on Friday in the backdrop of severe drought conditions forcing two turmeric cultivators in Kodumudi block to commit suicide in recent weeks.While the farmers argued that there was scope for the district administration to prevail upon the State Government to release up to 6.7 tmc from the hydel reservoirs to save banana, tapioca, turmeric, sugarcane and paddy crops in thousands of acres, District Collector S. Prabakar who chaired the meeting said it was not possible since the storage in the dams was the source of drinking water for The Nilgiris, Coimbatore and Tirupur districts. He, however, informed that the government has been sounded of immediate requirement of 2 tmc water.PWD officials said the special wetting in the old and new ayacut altogether accounting for nearly 1.5 lakh acres will require 5.3 tmc: 1.3 tmc for Thadapalli-Arakankottai canals, 1 tmc for Kalingarayan canal, and 3 tmc for Lower Bhavani Project canal, and that with the current storage of just 3.4 tmc, it was impossible to release water for special wetting. The inflow at present was just 110 cusecs as against 3,600 cusecs at the same time last year.According to the officials, 3.3 tmc water is required for meeting drinking water needs in the district till April next year, and that 1.5 tmc will have to be necessarily be retained in the reservoir.Farmers urged the district administration for getting Erode declared as drought-affected so as to secure compensation for the drying crops. They also wanted the district administration to speedily secure pending dues for cane farmers from Sakthi Sugar mills for amelioration during the drought situation.The speakers representing interests of old and new ayacuts came around to agreeing that the issue must not be allowed to be politicised and that constructive cooperation must be extended to the district administration for taking pragmatic steps.They emphasised on the need for the authorities to highlight requirement of funds in excess of Rs. 50 crores for broadbasing drip-irrigation. The existing allocation of Rs. 32 crore would not suffice, speakers said.The Collector said the cause for diminished accrual of water in the Bhavani Sagar reservoir from water bodies in The Nilgiris was being determined and that steps have been taken to check theft of water after its release from Bhavani Sagar reservoir into Bhavani river and LBP canal.As for the plea made for compensation to the families of two farmers who had committed suicide and a government job to a dependent, the Collector explained that though there was no provision in the law for paying compensation in suicide cases, and for sanctioning government jobs, the district administration had recommended the cases to the government."

Kumaraswamy rushed to the spot and convinced the youth to climb down saying that he would place his [the youths] demand on the floor of the Assembly.Chandru (30) from Kallypalya village of Kunigal taluk took everyone by surprise by shouting from the top of the tower, giving time till 6 p.m. to the government to accept his demand.Once the youth came down, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Amarnath Reddy took him into custody, even as Mr. Kumaraswamy suggested that the police register a case as per law and release him to return to his native village.Chandru clarified to the media that he had not indulged in such a dangerous adventure for cheap publicity. The government had fixed Rs. 2,500 per tonne of sugarcane and also announced Rs. 150 more for every tonne of sugarcane in 2013-14. But, subsequently, the price fixed during 2014-15 was only Rs. 2,200. The sugar mills were yet to clear dues for 2015-16. He had climbed the tower to draw the attention of the government and demand a proper price for sugarcane and not for publicity.Later, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that Chandru met him on Tuesday and expressed his difficulties due to losses last year. He also spoke about his outstanding bank loan of Rs. 2 lakh, he said. He had advised him not be agitated as the issue was being discussed on the floor of the legislature.He said that this incident was sufficient enough for the government to understand the plight of the sugarcane growers. The government was treating farmers like criminals and arresting them to prevent them from participating in protests.Are farmers terrorists? he asked and said that he would take up the issue on the floor of the Assembly on Thursday and try to sensitise the government about the plight of the hapless growers."

Twelve such units were handed over to the Krishi Yantradhare Kendra.The Chief Minister said that these harvesters were an answer to the shortage of labourers. The government had decided to make them available at the kendras in hobli centres from where growers could take them on rent.Mr. Siddaramaiah stressed the need for improvement in farm productivity to boost financial stability of farmers. Agriculture could become a profit-making venture by improving productivity; taking advantage of scientific and technological innovations; and adopting government schemes. The growers need to come forward to install drip irrigation systems to save water and also boost yield. The government is providing 90 per cent subsidy for installing the systems, he said.Earlier, Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said the government was providing 40 per cent subsidy for each sugarcane harvester costing Rs. 1.38 crore. The cost of manual harvesting of the crop was around Rs. 350 to Rs. 375 per tonne while the government wanted to bring it down to Rs. 300 through mechanised harvesters.Also, growers normally take a day to harvest sugarcane on a one-acre field. It could be done in just four hours by mechanised harvesters. Another advantage is that the machines cut the cane into billets and directly dump them into the trolley of a tractor or a lorry, which means enhanced sugar recovery percentage. Sugar mills can take mechanically harvested sugarcane to the crushers without making growers to wait in long queues. The cane leaves could utilised for preparing organic manure which will boost crop yield from 4 tonnes to 5 tonnes per acre, the Minister added.Government Chief Whip Ashok Pattan, Minister for Small-Scale Industries Ramesh L. Jarkiholi, and senior officials were present."

Kote and T. Narsipur taluks staged a demonstration in the city on Thursday seeking immediate release of water to save the standing paddy crop.The agitating farmers said that nearly 75,000 acres of land in the region is under paddy cultivation and the crops in the harvesting stage required water.Though the State government had already announced that water would not be released for irrigation as it was required for drinking, the farmers argued the government could spare at least 1 tmc ft.Paddy on 75,000 acres would wither and would cause loss to thousands of farmers in the region, said Kurubur Shanthakumar, president, Sugarcane Cultivators Association.He said there was adequate water in the Kabini reservoir at Beechanahalli in H.D. Kote and releasing 1 tmc ft would not result in scarcity during summer. The inflow over the next few weeks would ensure that the balance is restored, Mr. Shanthakumar said.The association members said farmers had already completed sowing operations when the government decided against releasing water during September.FRP hike soughtThe association welcomed the governments decision to increase the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane farmers in Belagavi and Bagalkot by Rs. 300 but want it to be extended to farmers across the State.The FRP in Belagavi and Bagalkot districts was Rs. 3,100 per tonne for 12 per cent recovery of sugar and had been increased to Rs. 3,400 per tonne.The FRP for Mysuru and other regions remains Rs. 2,300 per tonne for 9.5 per cent recovery.After deducting Rs. 600 towards harvesting and transportation charges, we are left with Rs. 1,700 per tonne which is less than cultivation cost, Mr. Shanthakumar said."

From atop a Cuban Army tank, he directed his countrys defence at the Bay of Pigs. Countless details fell to him, from selecting the colour of uniforms Cuban soldiers wore in Angola to overseeing a programme to produce a super-breed of milk cows. He personally set the goals for sugar harvests. He personally sent countless men to prison.But it was more than repression and fear that kept him and his government in power for so long. He had both admirers and detractors in Cuba and around the world. Some saw him as a ruthless despot who trampled rights and freedoms; many others hailed him as the crowds did that first night, as a revolutionary hero for the ages.Even when he fell ill and was hospitalised with diverticulitis in summer 2006, giving up most of his powers for the first time, Castro tried to dictate the details of his own medical care and orchestrate the continuation of his Communist revolution.By handing power to his brother, Castro once more raised the ire of his enemies in Washington.U.S. officials condemned the transition, saying it prolonged a dictatorship and again denied the long-suffering Cuban people a chance to control their own lives. Castro was perhaps the most important leader to emerge from Latin America since the wars of independence in the early 19th century. He was decidedly the most influential shaper of Cuban history since his own hero, Jos Mart, struggled for Cuban independence in the late 19th century.Poverty amid progressCastros legacy in Cuba and elsewhere has been a mixed record of social progress and abject poverty, of racial equality and political persecution, of medical advances and a degree of misery comparable to the conditions that existed in Cuba when he entered Havana as a victorious guerilla commander in 1959.

K. Kumaran and his son K. Dhaneesh are growing tea in their native village at Mangode in Pandalur.The Tea Board, in a press release about the tea-growing method, said that dairy was also an integral part of the farming system with indigenous breeds of cattle. The cows dung and urine, sugar cane juice, banana and soil from own garden is used as a concoction (Jeevamritha) which is applied as nutrient. Sugar cane and plantain is also sourced from their own farm, the Tea Board said.The tea is distributed directly to end users, and as a result, growers get a good competitive price for their produce. As I use natural farming inputs, my production cost is quite limited, Mr. Kumaran said. The family handle the farm themselves and ensure that the tea is grown sustainably, ensuring the safety of the environment, land, animals, trees and human beings, Mr. Kumaran said.The Tea Board has given its certificate of approval to Mr. Kumaran to go ahead with the natural farming method.Tea Boards Regional Office appreciated Mr. Kumaran and his son for the efforts they have taken for representing Nilgiri-Wayanad small tea growers in a world platform for tea.Their initiative is likely to motivate other small tea growers to come up with novel techniques for production and marketing of similar value added products, a press release from the Tea Board read."

Deve Gowda, former Union Agriculture Minister and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and senior Janata Dal-United leaders Sharad Yadav and K.C. Tyagi.With its Jat following defecting almost en masse to the BJP on a tidal Hindutva wave in the general elections of 2014, the RLD has since been working hard to reclaim its base.Milling mass of flagsOn Monday afternoon, the Jats of western Uttar Pradesh turned a generous stretch of Parliament Street, from close to Parliament House to Patel Chowk, into a milling mass of green and white party flags, sugar cane sticks and white party caps, cheering their leaders.Indeed, if the gathered Opposition leaders strongly delivered their message on the negative impact of demonetisation  the disruption in the sowing and marriage season, the long lines at banks, the return of migrant labour to the villages with their employers unable to pay them any longer because of the cash crunch etc., the RLD had a special interest  the impending assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.A woman leader who addressed the rally said: The money our mothers and sisters saved for a rainy day has now been tagged as black money.Not surprisingly, the RLD chief Ajit Singh received the biggest cheers.If outlawing Rs. 1,000 notes was to end black money, why has the government introduced Rs. 2,000? Was it to make it easier to accumulate black money? he asked.Peoples painTaking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, If speeches could fill stomachs, he would be the greatest leader. It is time he started understanding peoples pain, the fact that of the nine crore farmers in the country, over 50 per cent are in debt. He has increased the salaries of government servants, waived the loans of industrialists but does not have the money to waive loans of farmers."
58e50cd1a3d24b4437c4a958,"From Dubai, with love",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/From-Dubai-with-love/article16734454.ece,2016-12-01,"Chef Himanshu Saini is all of 29. The Chandni Chowk boy already has five years of work experience with chef Manish Mehrotra, and is the name behind the citys molecular gastronomy destination Masala Library and Delhis Farzi Caf.Now executive chef at Tresind, a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai, Saini was at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, last week as part of Cellar Doors pop-up. When we tell him that he looks younger than his age in pictures, he smiles, I have put on a bit of weight.Mumbai pop-upIt was during a meal at Tresind last year that included a wagyu kebab served with a chimichuri, that convinced the Cellar Door team that Saini was the right fit for their Mumbai pop-up. They clubbed the pop-up with an invitation to take part in the Food With Benefits event held at Atul Kocchars NRI recently.Each dish was unique, something I had never tried before, which was exciting, says Cellar Doors Nachiket Shetye. His partner Mangal Dalal adds, Contemporary food in India has become a very casual street food affair without the finesse. Saini stitches a story with his dishes. Saini, too, was itching to showcase dishes in Mumbai. We are pretty well-known in Dubai, but in India, not many know of our work. I know Mangal and Nachiket well, and it was a right fit of ideas, he says.Saini owes his expertise to Mehrotra. Whatever I am today is because of him. He is strict in the kitchen when it comes to quality, precision and following procedure: he will make you cry. Saini was selected as a trainee in his kitchen right after culinary school. At the end of five years with Indian Accent, Saini was promoted to sous chef. Itching to experiment with molecular gastronomy, he moved on to set up Masala Library in Mumbai in 2013. I always had the ambition to do something of my own, and many of my ideas didnt make it to the Indian Accent menu, as the chef believed the guests were not yet ready to accept them. Saini then set up Zorawar Kalras vision of a molecular gastronomy fine dining as well as Farzi Caf with friend and chef Saurabh Udinia.Sainis route to Dubai, however, went via New York, when he won a competition by Vermilion, a Latin American and Indian fusion restaurant in Chicago. He gave up his role at Farzi Caf and took up the offer to run their New York restaurant. Not all went well. Back in India, I was used to working with 20 chefs, and here was a mere team of three chefs, two of them being Mexicans who didnt understand a word of English. How was I to cook Indian food with them? I left within two months, he says.It was a regular customer at Masala Library who opened the next door. In 2014, Bhupendra Nath was setting up a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai and I took the chance to head the kitchen there. Dubai suits me best: there is a perfect mix of East and West, with a decent Indian crown, and Europeans and Arabs who love good food.Saini says molecular gastronomy goes deeper than the eye can see. I work with molecular gastronomy only when I am convinced it will enhance my dish. His creation of wild mushroom chai is still a bestseller at Masala Library. I have added it on my Tresind menu too. It is a consomm of dark mushroom, simmered in the oven for a few good hours. We served it as a tea set, the milk powder is actually an absorbent that turns to truffle oil when it hits water, and the tea leaves are dehydrated mushrooms. When you mix it all, it is the most comforting soup ever, he says, serving us what looks like a green balloon. We shuck it into our mouths like an oyster, but the burst of flavours are pudina, tamarind and chaat masala. Its a pani puri gubara with some crunchy boondi and weve been transported to Chandni Chowk. Sainis expertise shows off more in the false samosa. Its a samosa filling in a potato canola, with an ash of freeze dried chutney. It comes in a mini ash-tray, looks like a cigar, and has a bed of ash too. Yet, it tastes like the good old samosa.Since we are on the topic of chaat, in comes life is short eat dessert first, a jalebi on a bed of chaat. I recommend eating this with your hands, he smiles, and we follow suit. The cracker jalebi adds the sweet element to the otherwise tangy and spicy papdi chaat laden with a yogurt mousse. While jalebi and fafda and jalebi and samosa are a staple breakfast option in Gujarat and north India, clubbing it with chaat is a smart idea.Pullinji, a south Indian ginger and tamarind stir-fried prawns, is a dish that wins our attention with its glazed palm sugar crust, and curry-leaf flavoured tuile.Whats new?Earlier this year, in September, Saini launched his second eatery, Carnival by Tresind, a post-modern Indian restaurant in Dubai. Vineet Bhatia started the modern Indian cuisine at his London restaurant Zaika 20 years ago. What is life after modern India? It isnt more science, but in fact, goes back in time to traditional recipes without losing its fine dining avatar. My pop-up menu includes dishes from both the restaurants, says Saini, pointing to the table that has around 20 bowls of masalas: mustard oil, brown onions from Lucknow, farsan, papad churi from Rajasthan, kesar and red onions from Kashmir, and even south Indian curry leaves tempering. All these will go into the pot of khichdi we have cooked for over eight hours, he says.Saini is greatly influenced by street food. I grew up in Chandni Chowk, he laughs. From Mumbai, he loves the tava pulao, the lesser known street food that has even made it to his Dubai menu. We wonder if chef Mehrotra has tried his food now? He has come to all my restaurants, but his visit to Tresind and Carnival by Tresind is pending. Till date, I shiver out of respect when I am serving him."

We are doing this in the interest of farmers who are our shareholders, Umakanth Nagamarapalli, president of the board, told The Hindu . We have accumulated losses of around Rs. 304 crore, while the total value of our assets is about half that amount. Leasing out the factory to a private entity is better than closing it. There are no better options. We have requested the State government to look for a company that can manage the factory well and continue buying sugarcane from farmers.Officials of the departments of Cooperation and Sugar are expected to see through the transition procession if the government approves of the boards request.I know that once private parties take over, the board of management will lose its powers. I will no longer be the president. But then, there are no prestige issues involved in this. All we want is to help farmers in the district, Mr. Nagamarapalli said.Fathers workHis concerns are understandable. His father, the late Gurupadappa Nagamarapalli, a former Minister, was instrumental in starting the factory. He not only raised share capital but also successfully lobbied with successive governments and lending agencies like Apex Bank to keep the factory going.However, the factory has suffered an average annual loss of Rs. 20 crore in the past 15 years.Some farmers leaders like Siddappa Metre blame unprofessional management practices, politicised decision-making and favouritism for the losses.The move means NSSK may join the expanding list of factories in the cooperative sector being handed over to private companies. Eight of 20 factories in the cooperative sector have been leased out to private companies in the last 25 years. Among the States sugar factories, two are in the public sector and 35 in the private sector. Only 12 are active in the cooperative sector as six have been closed, say Cooperation Department officials.Gurunath Jantikar, president of the Karnataka State Souharda Federal Cooperative, is opposed to the move. All efforts should be made to keep the factory in the cooperative sector as private managements usually focus only on profits and tend to neglect farmers, he said.A resolution hasbeen passed by thegeneral body of the factory and sent to the State government"

When the 45-year-old finally reached the bank at 11 a.m., 40 other farmers were already in queue.Tempers run highIn fact, some of them had been waiting long before the bank opened for the day. By the time the clock struck 2, tempers were running high and patience low. A fight broke out when someone tried to jump the queue. When Jasbeers turn came, he was given just Rs.5,000 instead of the Rs.24,000 he was expecting. This infuriated the sugarcane farmer, who recently got lakhs of rupees as purchase price for his crop. The money was transferred directly to his account by the mill.It has been a month since the Narendra Modi government announced demonetisation and limited withdrawal of cash. Going by what the farmers in western Uttar Pradesh have to say, the situation looked distressing, to say the least.How do I surviveon just Rs.5,000?How do I survive on just Rs.5,000? How is Rs.5,000 enough for a farmer to run his family and do farming, asked Jasbeer, who has a wife and three sons, while on the way back to his village.He added that his tractor alone drank fuel worth several thousands when used for ploughing. He went on to list the various problems faced by farmers due to demonetisation.Extremely frustratingThis is extremely frustrating. There is simply no cash in the bank. Every time we complain, the bank manager asks us to approach Modi ji . How are the farmers supposed to work when it is getting extremely difficult to run the house itself?Rambeer Singh, another farmer from his village, said sugarcane farmers needed to access the money transferred to their account by the sugar mills as soon as possible.The money is crucial for the next season, but farmers are unable to access it right now. Because we are unable to withdraw our money, which we got after selling the sugarcane to the local mill, it will adversely affect our ability to sow the next crop. This will affect the production of sugarcane as well, said Rambeer.Rambeer sold 600 quintal of sugarcane as per the State Advised Price of Rs.315 per quintal and got Rs.1.89 lakh in his account. Though unable to withdraw the money for the next seasons crop, he is still able to manage thanks to his sons, who work in the National Capital Region.My sons gave me some money, which I used to sow the next seasons crop after cutting sugarcane from the field. But not every farmer is as lucky as me, he asserted, adding that there is no ATM in his village.One of the worststeps for farmersThousands of villages in western Uttar Pradesh dont have an ATM and people are forced to travel one to five km just to access their money. Even then, there is no guarantee that they will get the money, says a visibly agitated Rambeer, who called demonetisation one of the worst steps for the farmers.Far away from Satla, serpentine queues running into several kilometres can be seen outside a sugarcane mill in Baghpat.Sugarcane farmers have been waiting to get the crop weighed and sell it to the mill. The crushing season started in November. The money was transferred to their account last month itself. However, they have been unable to withdraw the money.Farmers weredying anywayDemonetisation couldnt have come at a worst time. Farmers were dying anyway. They cant even get whatever little cash they had at their disposal, which has made their plight worse, said 52-year-old Satveer Singh, who was waiting with a tractor full of sugarcane outside the mill.A farmer needs cash at every stage of farming. It is a tragedy if he cant access the meagre amount he has at his disposal, said Satveer, who is yet to start sowing the next seasons crop.Boon for middlemenThe delay in sowing the next seasons crop even by a day affects the final productivity. We have to do it by November 15. If we delay the sowing by a week, it decreases productivity by as much as 30 per cent. So you can understand how the cash crunch will affect the productivity of the next seasons crop, he explained.Adding to the farmers woes is the fact that cash crunch has come as a boon for middlemen and brokers, who have been doing their best to exploit sugarcane farmers and buy their crop at a much cheaper rate in cash.The cash crunch has made middlemen extremely prosperous, while the farmers are more vulnerable. The brokers have been offering a rate as low as Rs.225 per quintal in cash. Farmers who dont want to stand in line and need money urgently had no choice but to sell their produce to the brokers, he said."

Chowdappa, director of CPCRI, told The Hindu .Now, the city-based Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd. (CAMPCO), a multi-State cooperative society of farmers of Karnataka and Kerala, has made a new variety of chocolate, Kalpa, using the same sugar. The product will hit the markets on January 1.We are now manufacturing three tonnes of Kalpa dark chocolate with 50,000 bars. They will be dispatched to the markets of Karnataka and Kerala from December 21, said M. Suresh Bhandary, managing director of CAMPCO.He said that initially, CAMPCO will target the A class outlets and medical shops to market the product. The product is priced at Rs. 100 for a 40-gm packet.Commercial launchMr. Bhandary said the cooperative would procure the coconut sugar, which is also called palm sugar, from Kerala, Tamil Nadu and some parts of Andhra Pradesh. Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh will commercially launch the product at the Kisan Mela, which will be organised by CPCRI in Kasaragod on December 10.Mr. Chowdappa told The Hindu that with worldwide demand for copra and coconut oil now on the decline, demand for coconut sugar, virgin coconut oil and tender coconut water would grow because of to their medicinal and nutritional values. It can also be used to make sweets, he said.He said coconut sugar has a low glycemic index of around 35, almost half that of ordinary sugar. Blood glucose levels may not rise much with its consumption. Thus, the product is a better option for people with problems associated with diabetes, he said.Mr. Bhandary said Kalpa does not have any artificial ingredients and CAMPCO has the CPRI certification on this. This means even the health conscious can eat it, he said."

It is strange that the government is reportedly exploring ways to bring the NCSF at Bodhan under the cooperative sector, while the factory which is already under the cooperative sector is being ignored. Banks are also ready to extend loans of up to Rs. 50 crores, said Sai Reddy, the NCSF protection committee convener.Addressing a press conference after the meeting, Telangana Joint Action Committee (TJAC) chairman M. Kodandaram said that the JAC would conduct a meeting in Nizamabad on December 17 with all the stakeholders to thrash out the problem, and would take a decision to launch a padayatra on the issue. We are not against anyone. Our concern is about the revival of the factory and its management in view of the larger interest of the public, he said.When asked about the critical comments of Minister for IT and Municipal Affairs K.T. Rama Rao against him, Prof. Kodandaram was reluctant to react, but hastened to add that the JAC would continue to fight on public issues. We want the government to solve them. If they are solved the credit goes only to the rulers, he said.JAC district chairman I.

Sugarcane was cultivated in 17,000 hectares in 2011. The extent has been reduced to a mere 6,106 hectares this year, as per official statistics. The trend is quite alarming as both the farmers and officials are anticipating a further dip in the area of sugarcane cultivation in the years to come.Though we are offering a daily wage of Rs. 600 per head, labourers are not tuning up for harvesting. Instead, they prefer to attend to work under the MGNREGS, where they need not toil much for drawing a decent wage, observes Muppana Surya Prakash, president of the Samalkot Sugarcane Growers Association.A major chunk of sugarcane from the district goes to crushing at the factory owned by the Navabharat Group at Samalkot, while the remaining harvest to the Sarvaraya Sugars at Chelluru.Despite several measures being taken by the factory managements to retain sugarcane, more and more farmers are opting for cultivating paddy and vegetables, which are comparatively cost-effective, points out V. Venkata Rao, Assistant Commissioner (Sugarcane).The input costs are about Rs. 80,000 per acre and the average return is about 40 tonnes. This year, the price has been fixed at Rs. 2,800 per tonne. We should not forget the fact that most of the farmers are tenants and they should pay the tenancy. What else they will get at the end of a year-long toil? asks Mr. Surya Prakash, who demands inclusion of agriculture in the MNREGS and revival of the pricing system.The sugar factories have been doling out mobilisation advances to the farmers under their purview, besides arranging them expert advice on the crop pattern from time to time. Notwithstanding the initiatives, the yield is dwindling year after year. We registered crushing of cane weighing 1.7 lakh tonne last year, whereas the expected produce this year is just 1.5 lakh tonne, says G. Koteswara Rao, general manager of Sarvaraya Sugars."

When the 45-year-old finally reached the bank at 11 a.m., 40 other farmers were already in queue.Tempers run highIn fact, some of them had been waiting long before the bank opened for the day. By the time the clock struck 2, tempers were running high and patience low. A fight broke out when someone tried to jump the queue. When Jasbeers turn came, he was given just Rs.5,000 instead of the Rs.24,000 he was expecting. This infuriated the sugarcane farmer, who recently got lakhs of rupees as purchase price for his crop. The money was transferred directly to his account by the mill.It has been a month since the Narendra Modi government announced demonetisation and limited withdrawal of cash. Going by what the farmers in western Uttar Pradesh have to say, the situation looked distressing, to say the least.How do I survive on just Rs.5,000? How is Rs.5,000 enough for a farmer to run his family and do farming, asked Jasbeer, who has a wife and three sons, while on the way back to his village. He added that his tractor alone drank fuel worth several thousands when used for ploughing. He went on to list the various problems faced by farmers due to demonetisation.Extremely frustratingThis is extremely frustrating. There is simply no cash in the bank. Every time we complain, the bank manager asks us to approach Modi ji . How are the farmers supposed to work when it is getting extremely difficult to run the house itself?Rambeer Singh, another farmer from his village, said sugarcane farmers needed to access the money transferred to their account by the sugar mills as soon as possible.The money is crucial for the next season, but farmers are unable to access it right now. Because we are unable to withdraw our money, which we got after selling the sugarcane to the local mill, it will adversely affect our ability to sow the next crop. This will affect the production of sugarcane as well, said Rambeer.Rambeer sold 600 quintal of sugarcane as per the State Advised Price of Rs.315 per quintal and got Rs.1.89 lakh in his account. Though unable to withdraw the money for the next seasons crop, he is still able to manage thanks to his sons, who work in the National Capital Region.My sons gave me some money, which I used to sow the next seasons crop after cutting sugarcane from the field. But not every farmer is as lucky as me, he asserted, adding that there is no ATM in his village.One of the worststeps for farmersThousands of villages in western Uttar Pradesh dont have an ATM and people are forced to travel one to five km just to access their money. Even then, there is no guarantee that they will get the money, says a visibly agitated Rambeer, who called demonetisation one of the worst steps for the farmers.Far away from Satla, serpentine queues running into several kilometres can be seen outside a sugarcane mill in Baghpat.Sugarcane farmers have been waiting to get the crop weighed and sell it to the mill. The crushing season started in November. The money was transferred to their account last month itself. However, they have been unable to withdraw the money.Farmers weredying anywayDemonetisation couldnt have come at a worst time. Farmers were dying anyway. They cant even get whatever little cash they had at their disposal, which has made their plight worse, said 52-year-old Satveer Singh, who was waiting with a tractor full of sugarcane outside the mill.A farmer needs cash at every stage of farming. It is a tragedy if he cant access the meagre amount he has at his disposal, said Satveer, who is yet to start sowing the next seasons crop.Boon for middlemenThe delay in sowing the next seasons crop even by a day affects the final productivity. We have to do it by November 15. If we delay the sowing by a week, it decreases productivity by as much as 30 per cent. So you can understand how the cash crunch will affect the productivity of the next seasons crop, he explained.Adding to the farmers woes is the fact that cash crunch has come as a boon for middlemen and brokers, who have been doing their best to exploit sugarcane farmers and buy their crop at a much cheaper rate in cash.The cash crunch has made middlemen extremely prosperous, while the farmers are more vulnerable. The brokers have been offering a rate as low as Rs.225 per quintal in cash. Farmers who dont want to stand in line and need money urgently had no choice but to sell their produce to the brokers, he said."

In all, the sugarcane being cultivated at 14 centres across the state is being grown at this station for ascertaining the best culture among them.Sugarcane varieties from 14 centres including Kalipatti, Melur, Chinnamannur, Tiruvalarcholai, Bargur and Tirukattupalli are being tested here. The parameters such as growth of the cane, the node, internode, quality, sugar content and response to cultivartion technique would be analysed, said R. Chandrasekaran, Professor and Head of the Station.He said that this was the first time that such an experiment is being taken by the Station following advice by the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University Vice-Chancellor. More importantly, bio-manure is utilised in raising all these varieties. We do not use any chemical fertiliser, he said. The research also includes the resistance of each and every variety to disease and pest attack. Normally, sugarcane is prone for diseases including red rot, early shoot borer and internode borer. We will watch a careful follow-up on this aspect too, he said.On the bio-manure, he said that decomposed farm yard manure was most ideal for the growth of the sugarcane. Apart from this manure, the scientists also apply press mud -- a waste product from distillery units.He said that the duration of each variety ranged between 10 and 11 months. The cane would be harvested from January onwards next year and the results would be documented and sent to the Director of Research of the University. This being the first experiment, we may need more experiments for another two or three successive seasons for arriving at the exact and most accurate data for selecting the most ideal sugarcane, he said indicating that the Station would take up similar cultivation till 2019 or so."

Next to the shop are two men engrossed in a game of Ludo, oblivious to the children who are keenly observing them. All this while a man sleeps on a wooden bench covered in a muddied blanket.Aftermath of violenceMore than 70 Rohingya families, which fled their homes following large-scale communal violence between the Rohingyas (an ethnic Muslim group) and the Rakhine Buddhists in Myanmar, live here. The camp was set up in 2012 and refugees have been pouring in ever since. With fresh violence breaking out in Myanmar, predominantly a Buddhist country, a new batch has arrived  in the middle of the demonetisation and winter setting in.Most of the men are at home these days. The women are very upset as they have no work, says Tasleema, who speaks Hindi with a heavy Bengali accent.Ever since the demonetisation was announced, the family has been dependent on Tasleemas income.Meanwhile, a boy comes up to her asking for sugar while the two men finish their game.My first sale has come at 4 p.m., she says desolately.Hardly any identityThe only proof of identity the refugees have is a card provided by the UNHRC, which also looks into their grievances and immediate needs, but cannot give them jobs.Ilyaas Ahmed, who lives above Tasleemas shop, drives an e-rickshaw on rent in Govindpuri.

58e52a4c7be9e05a951f4eaa,Uniform food labels in pipeline,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161220/jsp/nation/story_125762.jsp,2016-12-20,"New Delhi, Dec. 19: India's food safety regulator is set to revise rules for nutrition labels to make it mandatory for manufacturers to display salt, sugar and fat, among other contents, on all packaged foods, amid concerns about misleading or selective labelling. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is preparing a draft of new rules to ensure uniform display of levels of sodium (salt), sugar, fats, including cholesterol and transfat, in all packaged and processed food, FSSAI chief executive officer Pawan Agarwal said. ""Some companies are already printing nutrition information on labels, some don't - we want everyone to do this,"" Agarwal told The Telegraph, on the sidelines of a food labelling conference organised by the New Delhi-based non-government Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Friday. Nutrition experts are hoping the proposed revisions will address gaps in existing rules that they say make current labels inconsistent across products and manufacturers. While many existing labels display absolute values of food constituents, they do not specify recommended daily allowances (RDA) or cut-offs. ""The absolute levels of salt, sugar or fats in a packaged food or beverage will carry no meaning for most consumers unless they're also told how much they can safely consume in a day,"" said Rekha Harish, professor of paediatrics at the Government Medical College, Jammu, and former national convener of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics task force on prevention of childhood obesity. However, existing rules do not require companies to disclose levels of nutrients in relation to RDAs. Harish and others say most consumers will need this information to make informed choices. The cut-off for the daily sodium intake, for example, is 2,000mg, or 5gm salt. The CSE, in a report released at the conference, has pointed out that a single packet of ""masala oats"" contains 30 per cent of the RDA of salt. The FSSAI is consulting with scientific experts on the issue of making RDAs mandatory on nutrition labels, Agarwal said, but added that the issue is complicated because the values of RDAs for some constituents may vary for people across different age groups. ""We are aware of these concerns, we're looking into them,"" Agarwal said. ""But the process of revising and notifying rules is a long process."" The FSSAI is hoping to finalise the draft rules in about a month after which they will be sent to the Union health ministry for approval, notification and responses from the public, including the food industry. The CSE has been urging the FSSAI to strengthen rules also to address selective disclosure, misleading labels and celebrity endorsements of ""junk food"" which it says is a popular term for food with high fat, salt, or sugar. It has pointed out that not all snacks are consistently labelled for sodium or salt. For example, one manufacturer displays sodium content on its sweet variety of oats, but does not display sodium content in its spicy variety of oats. ""People need to know it right to choose right, and the food industry must tell it right,"" Sunita Narain, the director general of the CSE told the conference. The Advertising Standards Council of India, an industry watchdog, has over the past three years pointed out several misleading claims by manufacturers involving products ranging from rice bran oil and canola oil to health drinks for children and digestive biscuits. The CSE has also called for regulation of celebrity endorsement of foods high in salt, sugar, or fat, pointing out that an expert panel on the Consumer Protection Act 2015, to replace existing law, has recommended measures to tackle misleading advertisements and fix liability on celebrities."
58e52b397be9e05a951f4f77,Máximo Lider who tormented US and ruled like a tyrant,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161127/jsp/foreign/story_121589.jsp,2016-11-27,"A collage of Fidel Castro's pictures from his childhood till 2006. (AFP) Fidel Castro, the fiery apostle of revolution who brought the Cold War to the western hemisphere in 1959 and then defied the US for nearly half a century as Cuba's maximum leader, bedevilling 11 American Presidents and briefly pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, died on Friday. He was 90. His death was announced by Cuban state television. In declining health for several years, Castro had orchestrated what he hoped would be the continuation of his communist revolution, stepping aside in 2006 when he was felled by a serious illness. He provisionally ceded much of his power to younger brother Ral, now 85, and two years later formally resigned as President. Castro had held on to power longer than any other living national leader except Queen Elizabeth II. He became a towering international figure whose importance in the 20th century far exceeded what might have been expected from the head of state of a Caribbean island nation of 11 million people. He dominated his country with strength and symbolism from the day he triumphantly entered Havana on January 8, 1959, and completed his overthrow of Fulgencio Batista by delivering his first major speech in the capital before tens of thousands of admirers at the vanquished dictator's military headquarters. A spotlight shone on him as he swaggered and spoke with passion until dawn. Finally, white doves were released to signal Cuba's new peace. When one landed on Castro, perching on a shoulder, the crowd erupted, chanting ""Fidel! Fidel!"" To the war-weary Cubans gathered there and those watching on television, it was an electrifying sign that their young, bearded guerrilla leader was destined to be their saviour. Most people in the crowd had no idea what Castro planned for Cuba. A master of image and myth, Castro believed himself to be the messiah of his fatherland, an indispensable force with authority from on high to control Cuba and its people. Castro wielded power like a tyrant, controlling every aspect of the island's existence. He was Cuba's ""Mximo Lider"". From atop a Cuban army tank, he directed his country's defence at the Bay of Pigs (a failed CIA-sponsored invasion of Cuba in 1961 by Cuban exiles). Countless details fell to him, from selecting the colour of the uniforms that Cuban soldiers wore in Angola to overseeing a programme to produce a super breed of milk cows. He personally set the goals for sugar harvests. He personally sent countless men to prison. But it was more than repression and fear that kept him and his totalitarian government in power for so long. He had both admirers and detractors in Cuba and around the world. Some saw him as a ruthless despot who trampled rights and freedoms; many others hailed him as the crowds did that first night, as a revolutionary hero for the ages. Even when he fell ill and was hospitalised with diverticulitis (inflamed colon pouches) in the summer of 2006, giving up most of his powers for the first time, Castro tried to dictate the details of his own medical care and orchestrate the continuation of his communist revolution. By handing power to Raul, Castro once more raised the ire of his enemies in Washington. US officials condemned the transition, saying it prolonged a dictatorship and again denied the long-suffering Cuban people a chance to control their own lives. But in December 2014, President Barack Obama used his executive powers to dial down the decades of antagonism between Washington and Havana by moving to exchange prisoners and normalise diplomatic relations between the two countries, a deal worked out with the help of Pope Francis and after 18 months of secret talks between representatives of both governments. Although increasingly frail and rarely seen in public, Castro even then made clear his enduring mistrust of the US. A few days after Obama's highly publicised visit to Cuba in 2016, the first by a sitting American President in 88 years, Castro penned a cranky response denigrating Obama's overtures of peace and insisting that Cuba did not need anything the US was offering. To many, Castro was a self-obsessed zealot whose belief in his own destiny was unshakable, a chameleon whose economic and political colours were determined more by pragmatism than by doctrine. But in his chest beat the heart of a true rebel. ""Fidel Castro,"" said Henry M. Wriston, president of the Council on Foreign Relations in the 1950s and early 1960s, ""was everything a revolutionary should be"". Castro was perhaps the most important leader to emerge from Latin America since the wars of independence in the early 19th century. He was decidedly the most influential shaper of Cuban history since his own hero, Jos Mart, struggled for Cuban independence in the late 19th century. Castro's revolution transformed Cuban society and had a longer-lasting impact throughout the region than that of any other 20th-century Latin American insurrection, with the possible exception of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. His legacy in Cuba and elsewhere has been a mixed record of social progress and abject poverty, of racial equality and political persecution, of medical advances and a degree of misery comparable to the conditions that existed in Cuba when he entered Havana as a victorious guerrilla commander in 1959. That image made him a symbol of revolution throughout the world and an inspiration to many imitators. Hugo Chvez of Venezuela considered Castro his ideological godfather. Sub-commander Marcos began a revolt in the mountains of southern Mexico in 1994, using many of the same tactics. Even Castro's spotty performance as an ageing autocrat in charge of a foundering economy could not undermine his established image. But beyond anything else, it was Castro's obsession with the US, and America's obsession with him, that shaped his rule. After he embraced communism, Washington portrayed him as a devil and a tyrant and repeatedly tried to remove him from power: through the Bay of Pigs invasion, an economic embargo that has lasted decades, assassination plots and even bizarre plans to undercut his prestige by making his beard fall out. Castro's defiance of American power made him a beacon of resistance in Latin America and elsewhere, and his bushy beard, long Cuban cigar and green fatigues became universal symbols of rebellion. Castro's understanding of the power of images, especially on television, helped him retain the loyalty of many Cubans even during the harshest periods of deprivation and isolation when he routinely blamed many of Cuba's ills on America and its embargo. And his mastery of words in thousands of speeches, often lasting hours, imbued many Cubans with his own hatred of the US by keeping them on constant watch for an invasion - military, economic or ideological - from the north. Over many years, Castro gave hundreds of interviews and retained the ability to twist the most compromising question to his favour. In a 1985 interview to Playboy magazine, he was asked how he would respond to President Ronald Reagan's description of him as a ruthless military dictator. ""Let's think about your question,"" Castro said, toying with his interviewer. ""If being a dictator means governing by decree, then you might use that argument to accuse the Pope of being a dictator."" He turned the question back on Reagan: ""If his power includes something as monstrously undemocratic as the ability to order a thermonuclear war, I ask you, who then is more of a dictator, the President of the United States or I?"" After leading his guerrillas against a repressive Cuban dictator, Castro, in his early 30s, aligned Cuba with the Soviet Union and used Cuban troops to support revolution in Africa and throughout Latin America. His willingness to allow the Soviets to build missile-launching sites in Cuba led to a harrowing diplomatic standoff between the US and the Soviet Union in the fall of 1962, one that could have escalated into a nuclear exchange. The world remained tense until the confrontation was defused 13 days after it began, and the launching pads were dismantled. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Castro faced one of his biggest challenges: surviving without huge communist subsidies. ""I faced my greatest challenge after I turned 60,"" Castro said in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine in 1994. But he defied the predictions of his political demise. When threatened, he fanned antagonism towards the US. And when the Cuban economy neared collapse, he legalised the US dollar, which he had railed against since the 1950s, only to ban dollars again a few years later when the economy stabilised. Castro continued to taunt US Presidents for a half-century, frustrating all of Washington's attempts to contain him. He often told interviewers that he identified with Don Quixote, and like Quixote he struggled against threats both real and imagined, preparing for decades, for example, for another invasion that never came. As the leaders of every other nation of the hemisphere gathered in Quebec City in April 2001 for the third Summit of the Americas, an uninvited Castro, then 74, fumed in Havana, presiding over ceremonies commemorating the embarrassing defeat of CIA-backed exiles at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. True to character, he portrayed his exclusion as a sign of strength, declaring that Cuba ""is the only country in the world that does not need to trade with the United States"".# Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on August 13, 1926 - 1927 in some reports - in what was then the eastern Cuban province of Oriente, the son of a plantation owner, ngel Castro, and one of his maids, Lina Ruz Gonzlez, who became his second wife and had seven children. The father was a Spaniard who had arrived in Cuba under mysterious circumstances. One account, supported by Castro himself, was that his father had agreed to take the place of a Spanish aristocrat who had been drafted into the Spanish army in the late 19th century to fight against Cuban independence and American hegemony. Other versions suggest that ngel Castro went penniless to Cuba but eventually established a plantation and did business with the despised, American-owned United Fruit Company. By the time Fidel was a youngster, his father was a major landholder. Fidel was a boisterous young student who was sent away to study with the Jesuits at the Colegio de Dolores in Santiago de Cuba and later to the Colegio de Beln, an exclusive Jesuit high school in Havana. Cuban lore has it that he was headstrong and fanatical even as a boy. In one account, Fidel was said to have bicycled head-on into a wall to make a point to his friends about the strength of his will. Castro entered the University of Havana's law school in 1945 and almost immediately immersed himself in radical politics. He took part in an invasion of the Dominican Republic that unsuccessfully tried to oust the dictator Rafael Trujillo. Castro's university days earned him the image of rabble-rouser and seemed to support the view that he had had communist leanings all along. But in an interview in 1981, quoted in Tad Szulc's 1986 biography, Fidel, Castro said he had flirted with communist ideas but did not join the party. ""I had entered into contact with Marxist literature,"" Castro said. ""At that time, there were some communist students at the University of Havana, and I had friendly relations with them, but I was not in the Socialist Youth, I was not a militant in the communist party"" Castro's initial response to the Batista government was to challenge it with a legal appeal, claiming that Batista's actions had violated the Constitution. Even as a symbolic act, the attempt was futile. His core group of radical students gained followers, and on July 26, 1953, Castro led them in an attack on the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Many of the rebels were killed. The others were captured, as were Castro and Ral. Castro was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Batista then made what turned out to be a huge strategic error. Believing that the rebels' energy had been spent, and under pressure from civic leaders to show that he was not a dictator, he released Castro and his followers in an amnesty after the 1954 presidential election. Castro went into exile in Mexico, where he plotted his return to Cuba. He tried to buy a used American PT boat to carry his band to Cuba, but the deal fell through. Then he caught sight of a beat-up 61-foot wooden yacht named Granma, once owned by an American who lived in Mexico City. The Granma remains on display in Havana, encased in glass. It was not until just before the Bay of Pigs invasion that Castro declared publicly that his revolution was socialist. A few months later, on December 2, 1961, he removed any lingering doubt about his loyalties when he affirmed in a long speech: ""I am a Marxist-Leninist."" ""As I listened, I thought that surely he must be a superb actor,"" Castro's sister Juanita wrote in an account in Life magazine in 1964, referring to the December 1961 speech. ""He had fooled not only so many of his friends, but his family as well."" She recalled his upbringing as the son of a well-to-do landowner in eastern Cuba who had sent him to exclusive Jesuit schools. In 1948, after Fidel married Mirta Daz-Balart, whose family had ties to the Batista government, the elder Castro had given them a three-month honeymoon in the US. ""How could Fidel, who had been given the best of everything, be a communist?"" Juanita wrote. ""This was the riddle which paralysed me and so many other Cubans who refused to believe that he was leading our country into the communist camp."" Indeed, although Castro pursued ideologically communist policies, he never established a purely communist state in Cuba, nor did he adopt orthodox communist party ideology. Details of his personal life were always murky. He had relationships with several women, and only in his later years was he willing to acknowledge his relationship of more than 40 years with Dalia Soto del Valle, who had rarely been seen in public. (Whether they were legally married was not clear.) The duo's five sons - Alexis, Alexander, Alejandro, Antonio and ngel - live in Cuba. Castro also has a daughter, Alina, a radio host in Miami, who bitterly attacked her father on the air for years. In April 2016, a frail Castro made what many thought would be his last public appearance, at the Seventh Congress of the Cuban Communist Party. Dressed in an incongruous blue tracksuit jacket, his hands at times quivering and his once powerful voice reduced to a tinny squawk, he expressed surprise at having survived to almost 90, and he bade farewell to the party, the political system and the revolutionary Cuba he had created. ""Soon I will be like everybody else,"" Castro said. ""Our turn comes to us all, but the ideas of Cuban communism will endure."" No one is sure if the force of the revolution will dissipate without Castro and, eventually, his brother. But Castro's impact on Latin America and the western hemisphere has the earmarks of lasting indefinitely. The power of his personality remains inescapable, for better or worse, not only in Cuba but also throughout Latin America. ""We are going to live with Fidel Castro and all he stands for while he is alive,"" wrote Herbert L. Matthews of The New York Times, who had interviewed Castro in his jungle hideout before the Cuban revolution and painted a sympathetic portrait of the young revolutionary, ""and with his ghost when he is dead."""
58e52bf57be9e05a951f5013,Lover lore: dozens to thousands,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161127/jsp/foreign/story_121594.jsp,2016-11-27,"Fidel Castro may have rationed sugar in his country and restricted the press, but never did he economise on women. Like Che Guevara, his colleague in war and the other poster boy of Revolution, Castro struck women with his good looks and macho appeal. But the numbers for Castro are staggering: one ""estimate"" - if an anonymous claim to a tabloid can be called that - says he had 35,000 women. More conservative estimates put it down to a few dozens. A disgruntled former official, hidden behind a pseudonym, was the advocate of the 35,000 theory. In 2008, the New York Post - which made it clear where its sympathies lay with the Page 1 declaration today that ""Scourge of Cuba finally gone at 90"" - had quoted ""Ramon"" in conversation with filmmaker Ian Halperin, who was making a film on Castro, that the Maximo Lider had slept with that many women. ""Ramon"" had even given the ""break-up"" as if he was referring to the menu for lunch and dinner: at least two women a day for more than four decades. This is the stuff of myth, true or untrue. If true, Castro must have found the diet agreeable, living to be 90, outlasting the terms of nine American Presidents and outliving many. If it is not true, it at least gives some idea about the appetite Castro had for women. They were all beautiful, very often not from the working classes and Castro did not have to work hard to get them. Everyone knew about them in Cuba, but no one was encouraged to discuss his affairs in the open. And for some reason, he kept his second marriage a secret for decades, making his wife a shadowy figure in a very public life. Castro married twice. The first marriage, to Mirta Diaz-Balart, who belonged to a wealthy family that would support Fulgencio Batista, the Cuban dictator Castro would overthrow to become the world figure that he was, lasted seven years, ending in 1955. The second marriage, to Dalia Soto del Valle, took place in 1980. Castro had had five boys with her, between 1962 and 1974, but Dalia was only produced before the public a few years ago. In between the two marriages, Castro had several affairs, including one-night stands, which led to much progeny, not all of whom brought him comfort. In 2009, journalist Ann Louise Bardach wrote a book on Castro, Without Fidel: Death Foretold in Miami, Havana and Washington, that spoke of the ""scale of his philandering"" and the existence of ""at least 10 offspring"". In 1993, when Bardach asked Castro during an interview for Vanity Fair how many children he had, he answered: ""Almost a tribe."" Castro often did not know about the children he had fathered. The women did not always feel that they had been treated well. While being married to his first wife, Castro had a passionate affair with the Natalia ""Naty"" Revuelta, a green-eyed socialite who was regarded as the most beautiful woman in Havana when Castro first met her on a moonlit night in 1952. Natalia, who was also married, supported Castro openly during Batista's rule and had pawned her jewels to help his war. They had a daughter, Alina, born in 1956, who was critical of Castro and lived in Miami where a lot of Cuban exiles live. Natalia had lived on in Havana, famously photographed in her old age where her striking beauty still showed from behind the lines on her face, till her death in 2015. She and Castro were not in touch. She would insist that she was not bitter that Castro had put the Revolution ahead of her. The CIA had wanted to use Castro's susceptibility to women. One episode in Castro's life could be straight out of the uber capitalist narrative of James Bond. In 1959, just after the Cuban Revolution, Castro had an affair with Marita Lorenz, a 19-year-old German woman, who had been sent by the CIA to assassinate him. It all ended happily because Marita could not poison him finally, out of love, she said. But then the CIA had apparently tried to kill Castro more than 600 times. Once Castro is said to have written to the CIA, thanking them for sending him a young woman who was very kind to him through the night, especially because she didn't kill him. But probably the most important woman in Castro's life was not a lover. Celia Sanchez had begun her struggle against the Batista government in 1952. In 1957, she joined the guerrillas and worked as a messenger. She helped Che too, with food and medical supplies, and personally looked after Castro and his men in their armed struggles that led to the success of Revolution. She went on to become one of Castro's closest aides, who always had his ear till her death from lung cancer. She was always with him. Some of Castro's critics have said they were lovers, though official accounts vehemently deny this."
58e52d727be9e05a951f51ac,Trump meet with India partners raises dust,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161121/jsp/foreign/story_120384.jsp,2016-11-21,"Nov. 20: President-elect Donald J. Trump met in the last week in his office at Trump Tower with three Indian business partners who are building a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex south of Mumbai, raising new questions about how he will separate his business dealings from the work of the government once he is in the White House. A spokeswoman for Trump described the meeting as a courtesy call by the three Indian real estate executives, who flew from India to congratulate Trump on his election victory. In a picture posted on Twitter, all four men are smiling and giving a thumbs-up. ""It was not a formal meeting of any kind,"" Breanna Butler, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said when asked about the meeting on Saturday. One of the businessmen, Sagar Chordia, posted photographs on Facebook on Wednesday showing that he also met with Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump. Trump's children are helping to run his businesses as they play a part in the presidential transition. Butler and Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, declined to comment when asked on Saturday if the meeting with the Trump family members included any discussion of Trump businesses in India or expanding that business. The three Indian executives - Sagar Chordia, Atul Chordia, and Kalpesh Mehta - have been quoted in Indian newspapers as saying they have discussed expanding their partnership with the Trump Organization now that Trump is president-elect. Sagar Chordia did not respond to a request for a telephone interview. But in a series of text messages with The New York Times early Sunday, he confirmed that the meeting with Trump and members of his family had taken place, and that an article written about it in an Indian newspaper, which reported that one of his partners said they had discussed the desire to expand the deals with the Trump family, was accurate. Washington ethics lawyers said that a meeting with Indian real estate partners, regardless of what was discussed, raised conflict of interest questions for Trump, who could be perceived as using the presidency to advance his business interests. ""There may be people for whom this looks OK,"" said Robert L. Walker, the former chief counsel of the Senate Ethics Committee, who advises corporations and members of Congress on government ethics issues. ""But for a large part of the American public, it is not going to be OK. His role as president-elect should dictate that someone else handles business matters."" Internationally, many properties that bear Trump's name are the result of marketing deals - like the one in India - in which he is paid by someone for the use of his name but does not actually own the underlying property. Atul Chordia and Sagar Chordia are well-known figures in real estate in Pune. Their father, Ishwardas Chordia, was born into a family of sugar traders, but as a young man forged a close friendship with NCP leader Sharad Pawar. Beginning in the 1990s, Chordia businesses built luxury hotels, corporate parks and residential projects in upscale neighbourhoods in Pune. The third executive at the meeting, Mehta, is the managing partner of a real-estate firm named Tribeca, which is also a part of the Trump projects in India, which go by names including Trump Towers Pune and Trump Towers Mumbai. Tribeca is also planning a project in Calcutta. Dave Besseling, a former deputy editor at GQ India, hosted an event at Sagar Chordia's hotel during the 2016 presidential campaign and said Chordia expressed ""elation"" about Trump's candidacy and the opportunities it would bring. The same week, Trump's daughter Ivanka - an executive at the Trump Organization hotel chain - attended a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. The move drew criticism from former State Department officials, given that Ms. Trump does not have security clearance and is helping run the family business enterprises. Butler, the spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the family was moving to try to formally separate Trump from his family's business ventures. ""Mr. Trump is not going to have dealings in the day-to-day business of that organisation,"" she said. Another spokeswoman for the Trump Organization added in a written statement that ""the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations."" Asked if such a separation had already taken place in the aftermath of the election, she said she did not know."

But the specific contours of the effects were probably a lot less understood at the time of that announcement. The deflationary shock has manifested itself in a deceleration in retail inflation, as demand for a range of goods and services has been damped. That the headline Consumer Price Index-based gauge hit a two-year low of 3.63 per cent for November is therefore no surprise, especially given the additional factor of a favourable base effect  the reading was 5.41 per cent in November 2015. The major contributor to the slowdown in price gains was the food and beverages group, where inflation eased to 2.56 per cent largely on the back of a slump in the prices of vegetables, a highly perishable commodity. But a closer look at the food group throws the spotlight on some trends that the Reserve Bank of India had flagged in its latest monetary policy review as areas of concern. Specifically, the prices of sugar and confectionery accelerated by 22.4 per cent while meat and fish and egg also reflected persistently elevated levels. The services sectors, including transport and communication and education, also manifested stickiness, underscoring the rationale for the RBIs cautious approach in keeping benchmark interest rates unchanged.Clearly, signals from the inflation data pose a conundrum before policymakers. With demand impulses taking a wide-ranging knock from the shortage of cash in the hands of consumers, proponents of policy accommodation would argue that the time is ripe for the RBI to cut borrowing costs to help impart some credit-fuelled economic momentum. But as the RBIs Monetary Policy Committee itself articulated it on December 7, while discretionary spending on goods and services in the CPI excluding food and fuel could have been affected by restricted access to cash, the prices of those items may weather the transitory effects since they are normally revised according to preset cycles. More importantly, the MPC cautioned that food inflation pressures could re-emerge as a consequence of disruptions in agricultural activity as a result of the currency withdrawal. The spectre of upward price pressures from key components including food and fuel  OPECs output cuts are already pushing up crude oil  combined with the fading away of a favourable base effect could leave the RBI with little wiggle room to support growth. With the central banks March 2017 target for retail inflation of 5 per cent clearly in their sights, the monetary authorities may be persuaded to keep the powder dry."
58e52e1a7be9e05a951f5258,Visa hope for diaspora descendants,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161128/jsp/frontpage/story_121741.jsp,2016-11-28,"New Delhi, Nov. 27: India may soon offer lifetime visas to the nearly eight million descendants of the indentured workers taken from the country to East Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean by colonial powers, trying to fill a hole in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's diaspora outreach. Indian-origin foreigners who hold Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards, issued under a scheme started by the Manmohan Singh government and expanded by the current administration, can already visit India without ever needing a visa. However, the OCI card, which does not grant citizenship but offers other benefits, is open only for up to fourth-generation emigrants from India, a rule that effectively bars many descendants of workers shipped out through the 19th century. The government is now drafting a plan to extend the facility and its benefits to older emigrant families, including those of indentured labourers taken by the British, French, Portuguese and the Dutch to their then colonies, senior officials have confirmed to The Telegraph. The proposal, if turned into law, will impact more people than any other diaspora initiative taken by the Modi government which, led by the Prime Minister, has made its relations with the Indian-origin community overseas a pillar of its foreign policy. But historical complications - in particular the absence in many cases of documentary evidence to show these families' ancestors had been brought in as indentured labourers - remain a stumbling block, the officials said. The effort follows criticism of the government, some of it public, for ignoring the families of the indentured labourers and focusing its outreach on more recent, better-off and influential emigrants. The descendants of these indentured workers - known as girmitiyas - make up more than half the global Indian diaspora of 15.4 million. ""Many persons of Indian origin in the girmitiya countries, where the immigration occurred nearly two centuries ago, are already beyond fourth or fifth generation and therefore face difficulty in obtaining the OCI card,"" a questioner had told foreign minister Sushma Swaraj from Port Louis, Mauritius, through teleconferencing during an interaction on January 9, foreign ministry records show. Sushma had assured the questioner that his concern would be discussed within the government. ""I can in fact feel your pain,"" she had said. As a first step, a team of experts commissioned by the foreign ministry visited Mauritius in September to study archival documents from the 1820s, when the first wave of Indian workers were brought in by the British to work in sugar plantations. But the government faces one key challenge. While the origins of these families - with their Indian traditions, names and languages - may be evident culturally, they need to be established legally before the government can extend benefits like the OCI card that can otherwise be misused, the officials said. Indian security agencies remain suspicious about visitors of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. Mauritius, home to an estimated 867,670 people of Indian origin, was chosen for the first trial because the country has maintained some of the best archives on the Indian immigrants who now dominate the island nation. Trinidad and Tobago, a former British colony that hosts 555,000 people of Indian origin, too has relatively well-maintained archives, the officials said, and the team of experts may visit the Caribbean country next. But officials familiar with the team's findings in Mauritius said that even that country's archives would help confirm the antecedents of only a few Indian-origin families. The challenge is expected to be tougher in many of the other countries: the labourers and their descendants had travelled to 25 nations and four French islands in the Indian Ocean. Many descendants of such families are aggrieved that while the first BJP-led Indian government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee had recognised them as an important part of the diaspora, the Modi administration has largely ignored them. In 2003, the Vajpayee government had introduced a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) card scheme, aimed at the descendants of Indian-origin families that have lived abroad for generations. The PIO card offered 15-year visas and was valid for up to fourth-generation emigrants. The Manmohan Singh government later introduced the OCI card separately, offering a lifetime visa but only up to third-generation emigrants. ""It was wonderful when, in 2003, we, the descendants of indentured labourers from India, were recognised by the Indian government,"" Deonath Jugnath, a 58-year-old Trinidad and Tobago-based industrialist, told this newspaper over the phone. ""Even when the OCI card came, our community at least felt that the absence of a lifelong visa for PIO card holders was compensated by an extra generation that was eligible."" But in September 2014, when Modi announced the merger of the PIO and OCI card schemes during his address to the Indian American community at New York's Madison Square Garden, many in the girmitiya countries viewed the move as helping recent emigrants. After the merger, eligibility for the OCI card was extended by a generation to fourth-generation emigrants. ""The families of those who migrated recently now know (that one more) generation too will get lifelong Indian visas,"" Jugnath said. ""But for us, the most important thing would have been extending the facility to older emigrant families. That would have brought many more families under the scheme."" The government has argued that the merger benefits the Indian-origin communities in the girmitiya countries too, by replacing their 15-year visas with lifelong visas. ""I have to say that there is one benefit that PIO card holders have got from the new scheme,"" Sushma said during the January conference. ""And that is, OCI card holders used to get lifelong visa which now even the PIO card holders get."" But the government is aware, officials said, of the sentiments of old emigrant families like Jugnath's, and the Prime Minister has made it clear to the foreign office that he wants to avoid charges of favouritism among different diaspora communities."

Lipid levels may also exhibit mild seasonal variation with a peak in total cholesterol level, say health experts.Cholesterol levelsCholesterol levels are closely related to increased risks of getting heart diseases. The higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater is the risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack. Heart disease is one of the leading killers of women and men in the India. For every 10 per cent drop in your cholesterol level, your heart attack risk falls by 20 per cent to 30 per cent. It is thus important to raise awareness about detection of high cholesterol, management and prevention, said Indian Medical Associations Dr. K.K. Aggarwal.High prevalenceAlso the average age of patients who suffered stroke, in developing countries (India), is 15 years younger than those in developed countries like the U.S. Strokes then become a major concern especially during season change.In India, nearly one-fifth of patients with first-ever stroke has been estimated to be aged 40 years or less. There is high prevalence of smoking, systolic hypertension, high fasting blood glucose level, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in our population at a younger age predisposing to stroke at a younger age, said Dr. Vipul Gupta, director, Neurointervention, Agrim Institute for Neurosciences, Artemis Hospital.SmokingHe added that women are five times more prone to suffer stroke than men. This is attributable to the poor socio-economic status and literacy rate among women.Doctors also added that this is a good season to quit smoking. Smoking can not only precipitate heart attack, paralysis but also increase blood pressure.Other common complaintsThe other common complaints include common cold and flu, skin allergies, and respiratory ailments. We are already seeing a rise in the number of patients with problems that are related to dip in mercury.

The strike, however, passed off without any untoward incident. The police arrested Joel Kath, Simon Kelio and Hukiye Yeptho on Sunday for allegedly raiding food and civil supplies department godowns without the consent of the authorities. The ACAUT and Federation said they would organise a public rally tomorrow here to press for the release of the arrested persons. They said the protest would continue till the trio were released. Yesterday, ACAUT started a signature campaign for their release. Today, leaders from several organisations met Dimapur deputy commissioner Kesonyu Yhome and discuss the deteriorating situation in the town in the wake of the arrest. In the past couple of years, ACAUT has been at loggerheads with the state government over several alleged scams in various departments. A source in Dimapur said the scam in food and civil supplies department would amount to multi-crore rupees and that the government was trying to crack down on ACAUT members to deter them from further protest. Sources said chief minister T.R. Zeliang, who holds the civil supplies portfolio, has asked the police to arrest the ACAUT members. According to the ACAUT and the Federation, foodgrain meant to be sold at Rs 3 per kg to the public are being sold in the open market at the rate of Rs 35 per kg. ""We don't get rice, wheat, sugar and other essential commodities from the fair price shops as they are sold in the open market,"" a Dimapur resident said. Several organisations have supported the ACAUT and vowed to support the movement till the corrupt people are brought to justice. The three ACAUT members were arrested based on an FIR lodged at sub-urban police station on Sunday by the proprietor of M/s Lotha Trading Company, R.Z. Lotha, who is a state stockist. In his FIR, Lotha said on Friday, a group of 40 to 70 people raided his godowns at Kevijau and Lomithi and sealed them. ""It may be mentioned that the stocks of public distribution system (PDS) rice in both godowns are meant for people,"" Lotha said. In a counter FIR filed by 13 villages at the same police station against Lotha, they said activities at two godowns were illegal as rice bags were being sold in the open market and to mills. Sources said Lotha has gone into hiding after the FIR was filed against him. ACAUT adviser Khekiye Sema warned of a ""jail bharo"" campaign if its members were not released. The organisation has been banned by the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) on the ground that its activities would have ramification on the current India-Nagaland peace process. It was totally against collection of illegal taxes by Naga outfits."

In the latest incident, the police busted a drug racket and arrested three persons on Saturday. The cops also recovered 32 grams of brown sugar from them. Despite a series of raids by both the excise department and the police, the residents of the area continue to trade ganja and brown sugar. The cops said a number of drug peddlers indulged in the illegal trade despite having served jail sentences. The police said the root of the drug-peddling racket originated from Balasore and its adjoining areas. ""The contraband is mostly smuggled into Odisha from states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bengal. Small-time traders in the slum procure these illegal drugs from Balasore and its adjoining areas and sell it in Bhubaneswar, making huge profits in the process,"" said a police official. The cops launched a crackdown on peddlers in the slum, which falls within Laxmi Sagar police limits, following the death of an engineering student on May 6. The student, identified as Ashotosh Mahanty, 21, allegedly died after being drugged by a peddler from the slum. Activities in the slum remain a major concern for cops. It has provided several criminals and peddlers a safe hideout over the years. According to the 2008 census conducted by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation, the slum had 2,300 residents in 654 households. But, according to the police, the population in the slum has doubled in the past five years and it has made it difficult for them to keep a tab on the criminal elements that teem in the area. ""As brown sugar can be concealed in small containers, it is hard to detect it. Besides, we have also found that some of the peddlers stored the contraband in plastic pouches in rice containers,"" said a police official. The police said most of the peddlers earned in lakhs, making peddling lucrative. One sachet with very small quantity of the drug is sold for anything between Rs 150 and Rs 200. The slum also hogged the limelight after some residents assaulted police personnel, including the inspector in charge of Laxmi Sagar police station and a sub-inspector in June last year. The incident took place while the cops had gone to the slum to rescue a youth. A 30-strong mob, mostly women wielding sticks and bricks, had attacked them. Deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi said the slum had been kept under surveillance for drug peddling. ""Our men visit the slum on a regular basis in plain clothes to keep a watch on the peddlers. We have also asked the residents of the slum to inform us about any illegal trading activity taking place in the area,"" said Bhoi."

To add insult to injury, South Korean steel major Posco and ArcelorMittal have shelved their projects for setting up a 12 million tonne per annum (MTPA) steel plant at Paradip and 8 MTPA steel plant in Keonjhar, respectively. The admission has come at a time when the state is organising road shows both within the country and abroad to woo investors. To attract investments, the state has already organised road shows at Hannover in Germany, Taiwan, Singapore, Yiyamin in China, Tel Aviv (Israel), London and Santa Clara in US. It organised road shows in New Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore, Goa, Chennai, Hyderabad, Gandhi Nagar and Jaipur. It also took part in the Make In India week held in Mumbai in February and an investors' meet in Bangalore in September. The state government has spent more than Rs 8 crore to organise these shows. The state has around 2,393 industrial units across the state. In Khurda district, which has industrial estates at Mancheswar, Chandaka, Infovalley and Bhangabanpur, as many as 196 units have closed down. In Cuttack, 377 industrial units have shut down over the years. Of the 30 districts in the state, Deogarh, Nabarangpur and Malkangiri have no industrial units. Despite this dismal scenario, industries minister Debi Prasad Mishra said: ""We are emerging as the most preferred industrial destination. We have received good response in our Make in Odisha campaign in Mumbai and Bangalore and the recently held event at Bhubaneswar. We are closely monitoring each proposal so that they come to fruition."" Mishra said that to attract the investors, the Odisha Industrial Development Corporation of Odisha (Idco) had set up a land bank and reserved acres for the upcoming industries in the state. The state government claimed 14 companies pledged to invest Rs 70,058 crore at the Mumbai conclave. The proposed investment is likely to come in the fields of electronics, food processing and renewable energy, petrochemicals, food processing, infrastructure development, gems and jewellery, speciality chemicals, sugar refinery, expansion and downstream alumina, alumina refinery, power and aluminium industries. In Bangalore, the state government claimed to have received proposals worth Rs 90,000 crore. At the Make in Odisha conclave in Bhubaneswar, the state government claimed it had received investment intents worth Rs 2.03 lakh crore. The state government has received investment proposals in 10 diversified sectors, the minister said. Mishra said: ""The state has so far signed 92 MoUs with a proposed investment of more than Rs 5.68 lakh crore, of which 46 industrial units have started their production partially with an investment of Rs 2.53 lakh crore."" While the big industries are yet to become a reality, several small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) are yet to take off. To make matters worse, as many as 15,315 small and medium scale industries have been closed down, said MSME minister Jogendra Behera quoting an all-India survey. Behera expressed his helplessness in reviving the sick MSME units stating that his department had a meagre budget of Rs 50 crore."

Picture by Vishvendu Jaipuriar A middle-aged woman in Barhi, Hazaribagh, whose PAN was allegedly used by a Calcutta-based company to open an account in Axis Bank in her name and transfer around Rs 37 crore since 2010-11, is hoping that the Narendra Modi government's crackdown on black money helps her clear her name. Kiran Kumari (45), who with her husband Vivek Kumar Singh works as an LIC agent, and lives in a two-room house in Shivaji Colony, Barhi, 45km from Hazaribagh town, said she first came to know the existence of the Axis Bank account on August 27, 2013, when I-T officials handed her a notice, seeking explanations of the huge transactions. On November 3, 2016, Kiran got the fourth notice that asked her to furnish details about her income sources and threatened her with action under Section 147 of the I-T Act, even though she claimed the I-T investigations in the past three years clearly proved she was a victim of identity theft. A source in Hazaribagh I-T department said the Axis Bank account 910020013305558 opened on Kiran's name received Rs15.04 crore in 2010-2011, Rs 15.21 crore in Rs 2011-12 and finally Rs 7.55 crore in 2012-13 from a Calcutta-based sugar company. The sums were deposited in this account through RTGS and transferred to the accounts of various other companies, an Axis Bank source corroborated. A closer look reveals that apart from Kiran's name and PAN, no other details are valid. The photograph in the copy of the PAN card for the Axis Bank account is not Kiran's. The address in Axis Bank records is one in Meru, Sadar block, with which Kiran has no connection. ""I had nothing to do with this. Income tax authorities have come to our humble home several times and have seen how we live. Then why am I continuously getting their notices? The investigation should focus on how the said company opened the bank account, how they deposited money and transferred it through RTGS to other accounts,"" Kiran told The Telegraph on Tuesday. Hailing the way ""Modi ji hit hard black money hoarders by scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes"", she said it sparked hope in her that she would finally get justice now. ""After demonetisation, the whole country is now talking about money laundering. I hope my case gets due attention and my name is cleared. Modi ji is my biggest hope,"" the woman said. Contacted, a Hazaribagh I-T official said investigations revealed transactions were done by a Calcutta-based company. ""Investigations are on into how the account was opened using Kiran Kumari's PAN,"" he said. Deputy director of I-T (investigation) Mayank Mishra in Ranchi refused to reveal details but said investigations were going in the right direction. ""I am not authorised to speak but whatever be the outcome, I can say we will get to the truth in this case,"" I-T (investigation) deputy director Mishra said.

An officer at Lalpur thana said while they were waiting for the autopsy report to arrive from RIMS, it was important to know how hospital staff had responded in the neonatal ICU when they found the baby's breathing shallow. ""So, we need to examine what CCTV cameras have recorded,"" he said. Sub-inspector B. Kujur of Lalpur thana has been appointed investigating officer in the case and city SP Kishore Kaushal said he was personally monitoring the probe. The baby girl was born to A.S.R.P. Mukesh, a journalist with The Telegraph, and his wife Sandhya on Wednesday afternoon. She was ""hale and hearty"" till 9am on Thursday, but was pronounced dead an hour later. This newspaper spoke to several specialists to understand the possible reasons that can cause death within 24 hours of a healthy birth. According to Ranchi-based paediatrician Dr O.P. Mahansaria, hypothermia or abrupt drop in body temperature and hypoglycaemia or fall in blood sugar level were not uncommon after birth, and both can be fatal. ""In fact, in winter births, hypothermia is a common cause of baby death. Hypoglycaemia can turn the body pale or bluish and lead to respiratory distress. A new mother should also be taught to hold the baby right to allow proper breastfeeding,"" Dr Mahansaria said. Dr Manas Kabiraj, a well-known obstetrician and gynaecologist in Jamshedpur, highlighted the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), commonly referred to as crib death. ""It is a term used to describe the sudden death of a baby in its sleep where no cause or reason can be found. It is very rare though. Only 2 in every 5,000 babies die a crib death in India,"" the specialist said. Dr S. Bhattacharjee, a senior paediatrician in Telco, Jamshedpur, said a congenital heart defect could not be ruled out in similar cases. ""But in this particular tragedy, it is a matter of investigation. The autopsy will make things clearer."""

He would be replaced by chief operating officer James Quincey, a widely anticipated move that comes as it tries to reduce dependence on its mainstay sugary carbonated drinks.Kent, 64, will continue as chairman on Coca-Cola's board, the company said.Since Kent took over as CEO in July 2008, Coke's sales have increased about 39 per cent, while the company's shares have surged 61 per cent.However, sales have fallen in the last three years as the company battled falling demand for sugary carbonated drinks and pressure from health experts and governments blaming sugary drinks for rising obesity levels.In October, the Atlanta-based company reported that its third-quarter profit fell 28 per cent.To counter the sales drop, the company is building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio, cutting costs by selling its bottling operations and stepping up efforts to reduce sugar in its beverages.Coke still gets about 70 percent of its volume sales from sodas.Quincey, 51, joined Coke in 1996 and became its chief operating officer in August 2015. His appointment as CEO was given a vote of confidence by Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which is Coke's largest shareholder.""I know James and like him, and believe the company has made a smart investment in its future with his selection,"" Buffett said in a statement.Quincey is credited with several recent changes at Coke, including introducing smaller-sized beverage bottles to boost profits and driving the reduction of sugar levels in its drinks."

A Common Services Centre in Malegaon. (Below) Another in Uruli Kanchan near Pune, Maharashtra.PHOTOs: AJAJ SHAIKH & arunangsu roy chowdhuryThe first floor office in Malegaon, in Maharashtras Nashik district, raises its shutters. The only remarkable things about it are its address  it sits at Tension Chowk, perhaps named as counterweight for a nearby road, optimistically called Aman (peace) Chowk  and the board outside advertising it as an Aadhaar enrolment centre.By midday, on December 2, there is the usual bustle of small commerce and this office, which many people think is a government outlet of some kind, sees its usual group of 10 or 15 people gathered around. Inside, a rate board on the far wall informs people that this is not just a place where you can get an Aadhaar card. There are a range of services listed, from providing caste, nationality and domicile certificates, to facilities such as online railway ticket bookings and electricity bill payments. The other clue that it is more than a sleepy Aadhaar enrolment centre is a small board next to that one, with a Bank of Baroda logo.Behind a single desk with two computers, a young woman accepts withdrawal slips, asks customers to place their thumbs on a small fingerprint-reader, and dispenses cash from a small drawer beneath the desk once they are verified. In effect, this office is an informal mini bank. And since November 15  when the government increased the holding limit of cash that such centres can stock per day to Rs.50,000 so that money can be easily available  it has been a lifeline to a cash-starved populace. That is, to those of the citizenry who know its exists.The Tension Chowk Aadhaar Enrolment Centre, run by an entrepreneur, Sajid Shaikh, is just one of a vast network of Common Services Centres (CSCs) that you are likely to see in virtually every small town and thousands of villages across the country. The CSCs help people apply online for a range of services  passport registration, PAN cards and Aadhaar cards, and a whole host of other certificates  without them having to visit a government office. CSC operators scan documents and upload them through a portal to the relevant government office that will then send back a completed certificate or card. They are like cybercafes, except they connect only to Digital India.Over the past two or three years, a huge number of these centres have added services like banking and insurance to their offerings. In a sense, they are an organic response to the growth in demand for digitised government services that a static state machinery cannot keep up with and the free market has seemingly ignored.When this correspondent visited the offices of other CSCs who were banking correspondents, it became clear that awareness of their existence  leave alone that they had cash to dispense  was low. This while at the Bank of Barodas main branch in Malegaon, a sign in Marathi has been out at midday, informing people that the bank has run out of cash. There are hundreds of restive people waiting in line outside each formal bank. It was only yesterday that the bank manager put out a sign with the numbers of some Common Services Centres, who are also banking correspondents, asking people to come to us instead, Shaikh says. Since then, a few more people have turned up to open Jan Dhan accounts. In Malegaon alone, there are four centres like his affliliated with the Bank of Baroda while a few others are tied to either the State Bank of India or the Bank of India, he says.Bridging the gapThe concept of CSCs was approved in 2006 as part of the National e - Governance Plan. CSCs are set up in a public-private partnership mode, with a designated state agency being a franchisor of sorts for village level entrepreneurs (VLEs) to set up centres. While VLEs come from various backgrounds  Shaikh used to run a business selling stamp paper before he started his centre in 2014; another CSC operator in Malegaon, Deepali Lad, says she used to run a business providing BSNL connections  they must meet a set of minimum requirements. They must have passed a matriculation-level examination by a recognised board, be fluent in reading and writing the local language, and make arrangements for infrastructure (a room of minimum 100-150 sq ft with two personal computers and two printers).According to Union Minister for Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad, when he became Minister there were only about 80,000 CSCs and now there are close to 2,00,000 CSCs across India. The National Democratic Alliance government renamed the project CSC 2.0 and announced plans to scale up to the point that there is at least one centre in each of the 2.5 lakh gram panchayats in the country. At current growth rates, the number of CSCs could be over 3,00,000 by the close of 2017.A thriving ecosystemFrom conversations with CSCs across the country, the average cost of setting up a small centre, land and building costs included, ranges from Rs.2.5-3 lakh. VLEs usually record 5,000 to 8,000 transactions per month. While the geo-locator tool on the projects website has been under maintenance for the past week, other sites like apna.csc.gov.in list centres in virtually every district in every State, suggesting that this is a business growing very quickly.The world of CSCs and VLEs is now a separate ecosystem in itself, perhaps best captured by a monthly magazine called CSC Tarang: A Silent Revolution in Rural Entrepreneurship that was started in October 2015 by CSC e-governance services, the nodal agency in Delhi that administrates the project. The magazine is an excellent window to the profession, featuring profiles of successful VLEs from across India and stories of those who have successfully set up centres in villages that fall under the Maoist belt in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, or in remote areas in the Northeast. It even has a monthly counter for the top five VLEs of the month, based on the number of transactions recorded on the CSC portal. VLEs usually record 5,000 to 8,000 transactions per month. On a consistent basis, VLEs from Gujarat and Chhattisgarh feature in these lists.In the November 2015 edition of the magazine, Dr. Dinesh Tyagi, the CEO of CSC e-services (whose notes usually start each issue), writes that despite agreements being signed with all public sector banks and a few private sector banks for CSCs to become banking correspondents, only 30,000 across the country had done so. He encourages more to get on board so that they can create the largest network of banking outlets in the world.For this years December edition, a month after demonetisation, Tyagi says that CSCs have been assigned to participate in the digital financial literacy programme of the government by going out and training at least 10 merchants and 40 citizens each in the use of digital financial tools for transactions. He says the State team and district manager would soon get in touch with each CSC to explain more about the programme. Work on the whole project should be completed by the end of December, he adds.Intent versus realityOn the afternoon of December 6, in the small town of Uruli Kanchan near Pune, Baba Rao Sawant is having a conversation with the district manager about CSCs. Its not about the digital literacy programme but about a fresh rigmarole involving banking services for his CSC. The district manager is telling me that the banks are finding it really difficult after demonetisation and it would really help if some of the crowds can be diverted to centres like mine, he says. There is some confusion about who has to send the appropriate letter to whom and the process for now has been stalled.Eight years ago, Sawant helped his wife Ujjwala register for one of the first CSCs in Maharashtra. They started with the basic range of certificates and services before moving on to offering banking and insurance services. Ujjwala managed to recruit several other women to help out and they formed a self-help group, all of them operating as VLEs. From a collection of small centres, Sawant then opened a larger space in 2013. It was like a mini Mantralaya [the Maharashtra state secretariat] in a large space, with 13 different counters for various services, he says.Three years later, Sawant says that the government system is not evolving quite as fast as he would have liked his business to, and that he had perhaps tried too soon to be all things to all people: We tried to scale up but the problem now is that despite the government saying that all these services are online, much of the work had to be done offline. Even though we got documents uploaded and scanned copies back, they still had to be taken to a corporation in Pune to get an official stamp. The other problems, he says, are that there is little done to educate the public about what CSCs can do and that he feels that he is often in competition with the local government. Rather than organising, say, an Aadhaar camp on their own, if the local officials just informed people about centres like ours we could get every single person in our area registered for Aadhaar and Jan Dhan accounts in no time.As numerous as the VLE success stories are, there are many who believe they are on the threshold of something big but havent quite made it yet. The networks obvious potential to bridge policy and people is hampered by inconsistency in government mechanisms and the legal framework that it needs to rest on. The system works well at the moment because of a combination of good entrepreneurial skill and luck.In Chhattisgarh for instance, Krishna Kumar Sharma, who runs a centre in Dhamtari, says he is able to offer 34 types of certificates to his customers seamlessly. All the documents come with the digital signature of the officer and there is only a delay if he has been transferred or something, he says. Besides certificates and passport and PAN card registrations, his centre offers banking and insurance as well as a small cybercafe space where people are trained in digital literacy. Sharma, a former software engineer, says that since he started the centre in 2013, more than 15 members from his family have joined him in the venture.On the other hand, in an urban centre like Surat, Jagdish Baldania, a VLE who consistently tops the Tarang charts, says that he has consciously chosen to limit his offerings. People come to my centre mainly for PAN card registrations, mobile and D2H recharge, and election-related work like checking if their name is in the rolls, etc. If I started offering more services, there would be delays and people might stop coming. He says already four other CSCs in his area have closed down and his is the only one operating, a stroke of luck.One of the main reasons that Baldania doesnt print certificates is because of the possibility of having to do offline work. Here he alludes to an issue of privacy and regulation: People think of me as a government employee so I dont want to do services that require a process that is outside the online system. What if they have some difficulty a few years later and they come back to me?In Uruli, Sawant also expressed a similar concern, mentioning that though he was registered as a VLE through an Aadhaar registration, he hadnt actually signed a formal agreement with anybody, which left a niggling doubt about his legitimacy.A collection of CSC operators that this correspondent spoke to from other States expressed other concerns. Many say that they have applied to become banking correspondents but there has been a delay in getting permissions while others in States like Odisha and Uttar Pradesh mirror Sawants concern that there is not enough awareness and consequently not enough potential for growth.Reaching the ignoredThe CSC network remains an idea  and a network  with huge potential, but it needs work. To get a clear idea of how much difference a CSC run by a VLE with ties to the community can make, one has to look at the remoter villages.Take Hingangaon, a village about 15 km from Uruli. While it doesnt have a CSC, there is one a few kilometres away, at a junction called Pimpri, where two petrol pumps and a few shops line the road. One of these shops, the only one doing business by late afternoon, is an e-service kendra. There is an orderly queue of about six or seven persons inside, three of whom have come for Aadhaar registration.Two staff members sit behind a counter. In an inside office, Sameer Sawant, a wiry 25-year-old who runs this establishment, is tallying up some numbers. Three years ago, Sawant thought of starting this centre because it was a great business opportunity. While working as a computer teacher in Uruli Kanchan, he had seen hundreds of people come to register for Aadhaar cards at CSCs and thought of starting his own. He chose Pimpri since it was close to his village and could also service four other villages in the area.Sawant shows us a small flyer that he has made for his centre that he distributes in the villages. It is a rate card that lists about seven or eight digital services, banking facilities for the Bank of India, and a few other small services like printing visiting cards that he does outside of the CSC roster. Through all this, Sawant says his centre manages to make a monthly income of about Rs.25,000-30,000 a month. Its not much, but he is optimistic. Many of the services have to be done offline so we have stopped that. But if I was able to offer more services, my business would grow. If someone comes for Aadhaar, I would like to also get him registered for a PAN card. There is a school close by here and during admission time students may need domicile or caste certificates, he says.On a phone, we show him a letter from the Ministry of Information and Technology explaining how VLEs like him should educate people on digital financial transactions. As he goes through the letter, his eyes light up. This is what I have been talking about, he says. I met an old man this morning for whom I had enabled e-banking. He was going to go all the way to Uruli to see whether a cheque he had deposited had been credited to his account but I explained to him that he could check this on his phone.He continues: There are also some workers from U.P. and Bihar who work in the sugar factory close by and I have been talking to them about how they can transfer money back to their families without incurring bank transfer cost. That amount makes a difference to them so things like e-wallet should be an option.CSCs, it is clear, could have a much larger role to play in moving forward in the coming weeks and months. For now, theyre scratching the surface.Rather than organising an Aadhaar camp on their own, if local officials informed people about centres like ours we could get every single person in our area registered for Aadhaar and Jan Dhan accounts in no time -Baba Rao Sawant,VLE"
58e53bf07be9e05a951f623c,Burnt: breakfast theory,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161225/jsp/frontpage/story_126747.jsp,2016-12-25,"London, Dec. 24: Breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper - if you want to overeat and put yourself at increased risk of developing diabetes, according to a new book. A British biochemist argues that people should fast until lunch if they want to stay healthy and that the case for breakfast has been trumped up by flawed studies and the insidious influence of the food industry. Terence Kealey, a former clinical lecturer at Cambridge University who was also vice-chancellor of Buckingham University between 2001 and 2014, sets out the case against porridge and Danish pastries in his book, Breakfast is a Dangerous Meal. If people insist on eating in the morning, a bowl of fruit or even a modest fry-up is, he says, preferable to starchy toast or cereal. The carbohydrate-rich breakfast, Kealey says, leads to a mid-morning jump in levels of the sugar-curbing hormone insulin, and doing this often enough is a recipe for type 2 diabetes. And he ought to know. Kealey found out that he had the condition in 2010. Using a finger-prick testing device called a glucometer to measure his blood sugar, he discovered that the levels were ""dismayingly high first thing in the morning, but - even worse - they would rise much further, indeed hazardously, if I ate breakfast"". The prevailing wisdom is that the four out of five people who eat breakfast are doing the right thing. As with many nostrums in nutrition science, however, the reality is that the evidence is a contradictory mess. Most of the statistics that are touted around about eating breakfast are based on observational studies, where researchers ask people what they eat and then measure certain things about them. The problem, according to Kealey, is that this makes it very hard to tell whether the participants are healthy because they eat breakfast or because they do other things that healthy people do. In the few cases where scientists have intervened, the results have been very different. A 2014 study from Bath University showed that people who were given a 700-calorie breakfast ate 539 calories more over the day than those who missed the meal. Even though the breakfast-skippers ate more at lunchtime it was nothing like enough to make up the difference between the two groups. There are some caveats. Some experiments have found that eating breakfast makes people fidget and move around more during the day, meaning that they end up burning off more energy. Different people also have different body clocks and genetic factors that could render a one-size-fits-all approach to breakfast unworkable. Last year, Israeli scientists found a nine-fold difference in the way people's blood sugar levels changed in response to eating bread. Those who cut back heavily on calories in an attempt to lose weight also release chemicals called free fatty acids when they are fasting. These can lead to a perilous rise in blood sugar levels after lunch if the dieters skip breakfast."

The Collector replied that the discussion would be conducted regularly and invited farmers for the first meeting on the issue at the office of Agricultural Engineering wing at 3 p.m. on January 5.Responding to outbursts by Senniappan and other representatives of farmers associations over the purported delay by Sakthi Sugar Mill to settle pending dues for the last three months, the Collector instructed the mill management to make it clear to farmers before the cultivation cycle whether it would be in a position to make prompt settlements for the procured sugarcane. If not, the cane farmers could look at alternatives.The district administration would do its part to secure the pending dues by issuing notice to the mill under Revenue Recovery Act, the Collector said when many farmers expressed displeasure over what they termed the unwillingness of the Sakthi and Bannari Amman sugar mills to pay the State Advisory Price over the last three years. Mr. Prabakar also promised to look into complaints by farmers that the Bannari Mill had unilaterally fixed Rs. 2,425 as the procurement price instead of the mandatory Rs. 2,850 per tonne encompassing the Central Governments Fair and Remunerative Price of Rs. 2,300 per tonne and Rs. 540 as SAP.The Collector reprimanded PWD officials for not doing enough to remove encroachments on water bodies and catchment areas in and around Sathyamangalam town."

It has also taken a leaf out of Maharashtra's successful model of marketing the drink. The blueprint would be operational from February 2017 - two months ahead of deadline - and will coincide with the beginning of the toddy season. The industries department is the nodal agency while Jeevika women self-help groups constituted under Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project and Bihar State Milk Cooperative Federation (Comfed) of Sudha milk fame are at the forefront of implementing the plan. Four nira processing plants, each having the capacity to process 10,000 litres of nira per day, are going to be established at Biharsharif (Nalanda), Khijarsarai (Gaya), Hajipur (Vaishali) and Barari (Bhagalpur). Tenders have been invited to set up plants and make them ready for commissioning within three months after trial run. ""Our plan is to use nira in three parts,"" industries department principal secretary S. Siddharth told The Telegraph. ""The first part will be sold fresh, chilled and unpackaged at local level with the help of vending carts having inbuilt cold chain."" The palm sap will be collected in mud pots used by tappers, the only difference being they will be coated with lime inside to check fermentation into ""toddy"". The industries department will provide vending carts with in-built cooling provision, costing around Rs 20,000, to Jeevika self-help groups to market fresh, unpackaged nira. The second part will be used to produce jaggery and sugar at the local level and efforts will be made to sell it locally or in adjoining areas, for which the Jeevika project is training people. The third part of nira will go to plants run by Bihar State Milk Co-Operative Federation Ltd (Comfed). Raw nira will be processed and bottled or packaged for sale in the market, including at milk booths, while a part of it will also be turned into jaggery."

Many who turned up at the seventh edition of the Walkathon said one or more members of their family had the disease, which is why they wanted to spread awareness about it and ways to prevent it. Every year the walk is held on November 14 - World Diabetes Day as well as Children's Day. On Monday, the north gate of Victoria Memorial, the starting point of the walkathon, was like a carnival with 400-odd participants in colourful dresses and the Calcutta police band blaring Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja, Sare Jahan Se Achcha and Hum Honge Kamyab. Divansh Thakkar of Class VIII, DPS Ruby Park, had no idea why his parents woke him up at six in the morning when school was closed for Guru Nanak's birthday. ""I spoke with many people here and realised the importance of being active and that obesity is a risk factor in diabetes,"" he said. ""I play only cricket. But now, I will start running and walking as well."" The teen lives with his parents Avinash and Reena in the Elgin Road area. Now that he has seen his son enjoying the walk, he would get his entire family registered for such fun walks/runs in the city, Thakkar Sr, a chartered accountant, said. Neelam Mohta of Auckland Place had arrived with son Dhruv, a Class IV student of St. Xavier's Collegiate School, and Yuvraj Bhaia, a Class VIII student of Birla High School. ""This is the best gift I could give them on Children's Day. They should learn early the importance of fitness and healthy living in preventing lifestyle diseases like diabetes,"" she said. The 1.5km walk that was flagged off by designer Agnimitra Paul at 7am encircled Victoria Memorial through Queensway, Hospital Road, AJC Bose Road, Cathedral Road and again Queensway before finishing at the starting point. A large contingent of first-year students of the Indian Institute of Hotel Management was part of the walk. Preparing a ""diabetic menu"" was now part of the curriculum, Vishal Kumar, institute manager, business development and strategy, said. Among the 200 students, was Alifiya Bamboowala, who said she took part in the walk because her mother and grandmother were diabetics and she wanted people to know that simple lifestyle changes could help prevent the disease. Doctors say walking burns up calories and reduces blood sugar - two of three main risk factors in kidney ailments. For diabetics, walking ensures better utilisation of glucose inside muscles, thereby helping in bringing down blood sugar levels. At least 20 members of Pronam, the city police's welfare project for the elderly, took part in the walk. Among them was Manashi Bhattacharya, 80, who has diabetes for the past 20 years. ""But I walk for around 30 minutes every day and that has helped me keep my diabetes in check."""

These two players are allowed to take 20 minutes for every four hours, said Jayasimha, who is holding more than a dozen Guinness records in various segments.He said the players would take fruits and juices as food in their 35-hour marathon carrom attempt and also catch up sleep in the night within the specified 20 minutes. The finger slamming the striker will undergo tremendous strain so will be the mind following the coins for several hours. A strong will power is needed along with fitness, Mr. Jayasimha pointed out.He said after eight hours the players would also undergo compulsory medical test such as blood pressure, sugar levels and pulse rate to avoid any unforeseen consequence. An ambulance is always available at the venue in case of any emergency, he said.He said present-day youngsters were more focused on studies and were neglecting sports. In the Rio Olympics, India could win just two medals whereas several smaller countries won many. The reason is lack of awareness, promotion and participation of youngsters in sports.Mr Jayasimha holds the Guinness record for the longest speech (120 hours) and recently he helped the Warangal police commissionarate stage a self-defence event with 21,276 girls and this feat made its way into the books. My next project is to stage a largest gathering of people for sex education by Dr. Kammela Sridhar at Hyderabad.The event was inaugurated by city Mayor Koneru Sridhar, former Minister Kanna Lakshminarayana, All India Carrom Federation chief Neeraj Kumar, Andhra State Carrom Association president Movva Chandramouli and SAAP chairman P.R.

Picture by Rajesh Shrivastava Nov. 12: Villagers allegedly looted a ration shop in Madhya Pradesh after its owner refused to accept 500 and 1,000-rupee notes, as people's patience seemed to wear thin at many places in the country after four days of the cash crisis spawned by demonetisation. Munnilal Ahirwar says he watched helplessly last evening as over 100 villagers, many of them women, looted bags of wheat, rice and sugar from his store at Bardua in Chhattarpur district. Ahirwar was allegedly roughed up each time he raised his voice or tried to physically stop the looters. ""I recognised most of the faces, but will the police act?"" he asked today. Police from the nearest outpost, 6km away, arrived this morning and registered a case of looting against unknown people. Long queues were seen at bank branches for the third consecutive day throughout Madhya Pradesh, while most ATMs remained non-functional for the fourth day, adding to the popular frustration. For the past three days, most rural areas have received no cash from big cities like Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur and Gwalior, which are battling their own cash problems. A video clip went viral on the social media, purportedly showing the police thrashing people who had lost their cool after waiting hours outside a bank in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh today. The cops are seen beating the people with canes and belts outside the State Bank of India branch in Porsa. The customers had tried to barge into the branch around 3pm, apparently angered by a policeman on duty allowing some people in through the backdoor, an eyewitness said. ""No one has approached us with a complaint yet, but I'm going to look into the incident and if the policemen are found guilty, they will be punished,"" superintendent of police Vineet Khanna said. In Chhattarpur's Motwan mohalla, Mathura Prasad Ahirwar was able to perform the last rites of his wife Raj Bai only after neighbours pooled the necessary money. His granddaughter Anuradha said the cost of the necessary materials such as milk, yoghurt, honey, ghee, wood and sandalwood came to more than Rs 2,200 but the shopkeeper refused to accept the demonetised notes. Eventually, the funeral was performed after sunset, which is not the preferred time according to local custom. In Sagar district, retired BSNL official Vinod Kumar Pande, 69, suddenly collapsed and died after standing in queue for an hour at a Union Bank branch. He was carrying Rs 4,000 in large currency in his pocket that he had wanted to exchange. Customers ran wild when a bank at Sujdu Chungi in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, delayed the exchange of the demonetised currency yesterday saying it lacked 100 and 50-rupee notes. Some people damaged the cash counter and stoned the police when they arrived. The mob also damaged a government bus and two private cars on the street outside. Later, the police carried out a baton-charge that left Khatiza Begum, 30, and Ayesha, a two-year-old girl, injured. Some people claimed the police had also fired in the air outside the bank. During the vandalism, a few customers chanted "" Mera desh bigad raha hai (My country is deteriorating)"" - a take-off of the slogan ""Mera desh badal raha hai (My country is changing)"" that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted after completing two years in office in May. Eyewitnesses said the problem began at 11am when an iron net attached to the teller's window, which some customers had grabbed as they jostled to get closer to the counter, came off under their collective weight. Someone then smashed the glass pane at the counter, prompting nervous bank officials to call the police. ""The bus driver and the bank manager have lodgedcases against unidentified people,"" circle police officer Tejveer Singh said. ""We are trying to identify and arrest them."" He said the bank received cash after an hour. Some 200 angry customers waiting outside a State Bank of Travancore branch in Kerala's Kollam district allegedly broke a glass door today after the bank decided to down shutters because of the heavy rush. The police are questioning several people. Long queues formed outside bank branches across Kerala for the third day, amid complaints that the ATMs were running out of cash. An elderly man had collapsed and died while queuing to deposit cash yesterday at Haripad in Alappuzha district, while another man fell to his death from a building housing a bank branch in Kannur. People clashed with bank officials at several places in Gujarat, prompting police baton-charges and detention. Customers complained that several ATMs were closed and that banks were exchanging the demonetised notes with coins and very small-denomination currencies. ""Even hospitals are refusing to accept the larger notes,"" Ramesh Agarwal said. ""Bank officials said they had run out of the new 2,000-rupee notes and only had coins,"" said Bipin Patel. ""They have given me coins for Rs 4,000, which is very difficult to carry."" Rajesh Shah, a senior citizen, said: ""We stood in queues for two days.... We have Rs 3 lakh in our bank account but can't buy essentials. Modi should have made proper arrangements for cash."" The police caned customers who had clashed with bank officials when they refused to dispense money at a branch at Shihori in Banaskantha district. A similar incident was reported from Abdasa in Kutch. A senior assistant of the Kolhapur zilla parishad in Maharashtra was arrested on the charge of accepting a bribe of Rs 35,000 that contained 17 newly introduced Rs 2,000 currency notes, officials said. Chandrakant Sawardekar, 45, had allegedly promised to help the complainant secure a promotion as a principal in a zilla parishad-run school."

This, many expect, would create more room for interest rate cuts."

The road map targets, among others, reviving a few dead industries, setting up a large number of parks (like tea, pharma, plastic and organic parks) and organising a mega investment summit in the state next year. Talking to reporters, state commerce and industry minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said considering its available resources, the state has a huge potential of emerging as an industry hub to attract investors across the state and from abroad. Patowary said Rs 5,000 crore was invested in the state after the BJP-led government came to power and more than 25 big industries are in the pipeline, many of which will be commissioned within a year. ""Nearly 44,000 people will get direct or indirect employment through these industries. A large number of small and micro industries are also coming forward to invest in the state. Multinational and big companies have approached us and shown keen interest to invest,"" he said. Patowary said the state government would provide a thrust to rubber, plastic, IT-enabled services, tea, jute, agro and mineral-based industries as raw materials for these sectors are available in the state. A bamboo park at Chaygaon in Kamrup, plastic park at Gellapukhuri in Tinsukia and mega food park at Tihu in Nalbari are ready. The plastic park and cold storage at food parks would be operational by next month. Making Assam a vibrant sugarcane belt in the country is also a target of the road map. It says an integrated project is being taken up to promote scientific cultivation of sugarcane and setting up of at least five sugar factories through private investment in the state. These sugarcane industries will not only produce sugar but also generate power and ethanol and accelerate the economic growth of the state, besides benefiting the farmers. Central and lower Assam will be in focus as the centres of the sugar industry. ""We will set up 100 primary processing centres across the state to process agricultural products like fruits, vegetables and spices to supply them to big industries. The number of such centres will be increased to 500 in the next few years,"" said Patowary. ""The tea industry is one of the big industries of the state that give employment to a large number of people. Promotion and growth of this sector is a must. Therefore, we have planned to give focused attention by providing facilities like shed, bought leaf factories and vehicles under the Cess Utilisation (Amendment) Policy, 2015,"" Patowary said. ""We will set up five modern food parks in the state. Apart from food processing units, these parks will provide facilities for storage of raw materials and finished products. One food park is ready at Tihu and another is being set up by Patanjali. The Centre is considering one at Tinsukia, while the state government is planning two more from its resources,"" he added. The minister said the mega investment summit, where national and international companies will participate, would be held in October or November next year. ""We will organise road shows across the country and abroad to attract investment in Assam,"" he said. Patowary said the plastic park in Tinsukia will be operational next month. He said the state government was committed to setting up a new unit at Ashok Paper Mill and this would be done through private investment. The Centre is likely to announce the North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (NEIIPP) in April. ""We hope the new policy will be an investment-friendly one for the state,"" he added."
58e5402f7be9e05a951f67cf,"Look who's losing sleep, Ma",http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161116/jsp/frontpage/story_119440.jsp,2016-11-16,"Nov. 15: Most farmers of Bihar beg to differ with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has said it is only the corrupt and rich who are losing sleep because of demonetisation. While the cash crunch due to the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes means long queues at ATMs and banks for others, for the tillers of the state whose produce fills the food bowl of Bihar and large parts of the country, the crisis has become a hydra-headed monster that threatens their very existence with the entire farming cycle - from seed procurement to harvesting to sale - thrown out of whack. And while the ATM trauma may normalise - fingers crossed - sooner rather than later, normalising the farming market is going to be a Herculean task. On the one hand, farmers are worried about harvesting and sale of their standing paddy crop. On the other, the worry over availability of funds to buy fertilisers and seeds for the rabi crop is also gnawing away at their sleep. ""We pay both in cash and kind (barter system) to labourers who work in our fields to harvest the paddy crop,"" said Raman Rai, a farmer from Sahar in Bhojpur district who owns 20 acres of land. ""The cash crunch has forced us to limit paddy harvesting work as only those who are willing to harvest the crop in return for payment in kind are working; those looking for cash have refused to work."" Rai is also worried about cash he will need to buy seeds and fertilisers for the rabi crop - wheat, which is sown immediately after paddy harvesting and the sowing season for which continues for about a month starting around November 15. ""If the cash flow does not return to normal soon our rabi crop will be delayed which, in turn, will reduce the produce,"" he said. Rai said he had been visiting a bank branch around 6km from his village for the past four days to exchange currency notes. ""I cannot do it on a regular basis as I also need to take care of my fields,"" he said. Around four-fifth of the state's 10.38 crore population is dependent on agriculture and allied activities. Majority of them are marginal subsistence farmers. The net cropped area of around 55 lakh hectares is divided into 1.61 crore holdings, and the average land-holding size in the state is around 0.35 hectare. A hectare of land is 2.47 acre. Paddy cultivation is done in around 33 lakh hectares of land while wheat, the main rabi crop, is grown in around 23 lakh hectares. As one travels northwards from Bhojpur to Saran, the picture remains the same - grim. ""Currency crunch is going to hit our rabi crop,"" said Nand Kumar Singh, a farmer from Sitab Diara village in Saran district. ""What will we do with money once the sowing season is gone?"" ""If the standing paddy crop is left in the field for more than a week after it is ready, it leads to fall of grains from the plant and thus reduction in produce,"" explained Anil Jha, an expert with the state agriculture department. ""A minimum of 120 to 130 days are required for proper growth of a wheat plant. If sowing gets delayed the plant would be ready towards end of March or April, when westerly winds blow in the state and it would damage the standing wheat crop."" The alarm signals are not limited to traditional crop such as paddy and wheat. Even those growing cash crops are worried. Mithilesh Tiwari of Phuljharia village in West Champaran district, located at the northwestern tip of the state, is concerned about his standing sugarcane crop. ""Earlier, the local sugar factory used to give us some advance as we are regular suppliers of the crop to the factory, but this time around the factory management has informed us that advance will not be paid till the cash flow returns to normal,"" Tiwari said. Bholanath Jha, of Jhapa village in Muzaffarpur district in north Bihar, is worried about the other end of the farming cycle - the sale of his paddy crop, which he managed to harvest as he could find labourers willing to harvest the crop in lieu of some of the harvest. ""With the acute cash shortage in the market, who will purchase my produce?"" Bholanath asked. Amid these voices of concern there are few farmers who appear nonchalant when it comes to impact of demonetisation on farmers in Bihar. There are some farmers untouched by the cash crisis, and Bhikhari Ansari, from Chainpur village in East Champaran district, is one of them. ""Big farmers, who do cash-intensive farming, might be facing trouble but marginal farmers like us who harvest our crop with the help of family members have no problem due to the cash crunch,"" Ansari said. He also said that seed and fertiliser dealers were providing the items on credit for the rabi crop, because they know once the harvested crop is sold the farmers will pay them back. Bhushan Yadav, of Kamarganj village in Bhagalpur district, echoed Ansari, maintaining that many farmers use small denomination notes and inputs for rabi crop can be procured on credit. But Ansari and Bhushan seem to be in the minority. Most farmers this newspaper spoke to are worried sick about the cash crunch. ""One should not forget,"" said economist P.P. Ghosh, ""that the currency crunch will not only hit landowners but also the landless people who work as farm labourers in rural Bihar. If agricultural work is hampered due to the crisis, these people will not find work and it will wreak havoc in rural Bihar."""

(PTI) Guwahati, Nov. 18: Dibrugarh police seized Rs 9.5 lakh in cash from Assam Public Service Commission (APSC) cash-for-jobs scam accused Samedur Rahman's Hatigaon residence here while prime accused and APSC chairman Rakesh Kumar Paul was today sent to judicial custody till December 3. The police suspect that the money, seized from Rahman's house last night, was proceeds of corruption. The police have also seized a Mahindra Scorpio, which was registered in the name of Rahman's son. Sleuths of vigilance and anti-corruption department is probing into the allegations of Rahman amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. He had allegedly invested a large sum of money in life insurance. Paul was produced before the court of special judge, Assam, A. Bhattacharyya, today following the expiry of his 14-day-police remand today and the court forwarded him to judicial custody for two weeks. Special public prosecutor Bijon Kumar Mahajan today said there was no scope for further extension of Paul's police remand since he had already spent maximum 14 days in police custody after arrest. The police produced the total sum of money, recovered from Rahman's residence, before the court, which asked them to deposit it in Dispur treasury. Rahman was arrested from his house at Rangiya in Kamrup district on November 9 for his alleged role in the scam. Paul today told the court that he is suffering from chest pain, diabetes and high blood sugar but the medical report, submitted by the prosecution, said he is not suffering from any serious ailment. The court directed hat Paul, who was arrested on November 4, should be provided proper medical treatment in jail. Paul's counsel, Angshuman Bora today, however, did not press for hearing of his bail application, which was kept pending when he was produced in the court after his arrest. Bora alleged that a big conspiracy had been hatched against his client by framing him in this case in a bid to deflect public attention from the controversy over granting Indian citizenship to Hindu migrants from Bangladesh. He argued that there was nothing unusual in the recovery of answer scripts from Paul's house since he was occupying the top post in the APSC and it shouldn't be considered an offence. Bora likened it to teachers of schools and colleges taking answer scripts home. ""Recovery of answer scripts from the house of a principal can't be considered a crime and not sustainable in law,"" he said.# Dibrugarh additional SP (security) Surjeet Singh Panesar, the investigating officer of the APSC recruitment scam, today submitted a list of articles seized during the search conducted yesterday at Paul's office chamber before the special court, Assam. The list mentioned a diary of the government of Assam and a piece of paper with four names written on it. A source said one of the names is of a certain ""Bharat Nara"" while the other three names were suspected to be that of candidates who had appeared in recruitment exams conducted by the APSC."

Picture by Prem Singh New Delhi, Nov. 19: A bald customer placing 10 bottles of coconut hair oil in a shopping cart, a woman stacking up 15 packets of sanitary napkins, another lugging 40kg atta and 20kg of sugar and one with 20 bottles of shampoo.... It is possible that the hair oil customer has several long-haired relatives at home but the patrons of Kendriya Bhandar outlets in the capital have been getting rid of their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes like there is no tomorrow. Parked outside these government-run subsidised retail stores - where old notes are accepted like at government hospitals, milk booths and petrol pumps - are rows and rows of sedans and SUVs. People with trolleys piled with goods - perishable and non-perishable - can be seen racing to unload them all into the boots or on the back seats of their cars. The consumer is smart but the government is smarter. Today, the finance ministry slapped a daily limit. Using the old high-value notes, purchases in these stores cannot be made beyond Rs 10,000 a day, according to a notification that has surfaced in the Kendriya Bhandar outlets. Transactions above the limit can be done using valid notes or cards. Before November 8, when the Prime Minister announced the demonetisation drive, most purchases per person were below Rs 1,500. The network of Kendriya Bhandar stores was set up primarily for central government and allied employees. But there is no bar on anyone else from shopping at these stores. The profile of the clientele and the volume of business per person have undergone a transformation since November 8. ""We have had people buying groceries for Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000 in the last few days. It has been mayhem. We have had to re-stock every hour,"" said an official at the Kendriya Bhandar outlet on Mahadev Road in central Delhi. ""Once people get in, we cannot stop them from buying as much as they want. We have been abused and harassed by customers waiting for their turn, but what could we have done? With today's notification, more people will get a chance to take care of their daily needs."" Taxi driver Sukhjinder Singh, who had come all the way from Mehrauli in south Delhi to the Mahadev Road outlet, vented his frustration. ""My wife has been waiting in the line since 9am today. Five hours later, she is still waiting,"" he said, as his three kids sat patiently in the car. ""People are just buying stuff as if an emergency has been declared in the country. Their trolleys are laden with stuff which will suffice for months. We, the poor, who can at the most buy Rs 1,000 worth of groceries, are left with empty shelves and old notes."" Delhi has 101 Kendriya Bhandar outlets, many of which are not accessible to the general public as they are in high-security areas. There are a few stores in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Assam. At the Kali Bari Road store in central Delhi too, the scene is much the same - people in sedans making sure their old notes are disposed of before the demonetisation rules change again while the less privileged await their turn. ""I have a huge family,"" said Rahul Desai, as he and his daughter unloaded stuff on to the back seat of their sedan with three full trolleys waiting in the queue. ""We need these things, Madam,"" he said, asked why he had bought so many bottles of glass cleaner. A group of six middle-aged women, who wheeled seven loaded trolleys out of the Mahadev Road store after a three-hour shopping spree, turned belligerent when asked for how many months they had stocked up. ""Why do you ask these questions? We are spending our own money. It is for my family,"" one of them said angrily, as another told someone over the phone to send two more cars to ferry the goods home. Rimpy Gupta, who has an export business, was open about why she had come to a government store for the first time ever to buy groceries. ""I have bought stuff that I don't need. But what to do? If I go to a bank, I will be able to exchange only Rs 2,000. But here I have spent Rs 8,500 and I am relieved that these old notes are off my chest. ""I was planning to spend much more, but couldn't because of the restrictions,"" said Gupta, who still has Rs 40,000 in old notes to dispose of. Asked what she would do with 20 cartons of fruit juices that have a shelf life, she stared. ""Oh, I will buy new ones."" At the other end of the spectrum is Amarjeet Singh, a contractor who is tired of waiting. In a fit of frustration, he said the cash limit at Kendriya Bhandar outlets should be cut to Rs 2,000 per bill. ""This has become routine for us. Stand in the line outside the bank in the morning and do the same in the afternoon at grocery stores. While you can exchange only Rs 2,000 at banks, here you can easily exchange Rs 10,000. ""So here too, the rich who can buy Rs 10,000 worth of groceries at one go are benefited and the poor whose salaries are just that much are the losers. This government has ensured that the poor suffer everywhere."""

The couple were on their way to Biramitrapur on a motorcycle when the four motorcycle-borne youths waylaid them and misbehaved with the woman. When her husband resisted, they thrashed him badly. Following this, two of the accused held her husband, while the other two gang-raped the woman, said a source in the police. The police said the Pitamalah dam area is at one corner of a forest and the place was deserted when the incident took place. The accused took advantage of the thick foliage in the area. The ordeal continued for two-and-a-half-hours after which the offenders left in their bikes, which were parked at a distance. The couple then went to the Kalunga outpost and lodged a complaint with the police. Following this, Brahmanitaranga police took up the case. Inspector in charge of Brahmanitaranga police station S.N. Muduli said: ""We are yet to nab the accused. However, we have got some lead in the case and we will be able to catch them soon. The couple had come from outside and were staying at Biramitrapur. The victims have been medically examined at the government hospital in Rourkela.""

The aim is to provide immediate relief to the economically weaker sections struggling with little or no cash in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. However, the Congress government could offer the facility in December too if the crisis continued. ""If the availability of cash doesn't improve in December, we will extend the credit facility till the end of the year,"" food and civil supplies minister U.T. Khader said today. He said PDS beneficiaries would be able to avail themselves of the facility from tomorrow. Chief minister P.C. Siddaramiah had earlier asked his ministers to keep a watch on developments following the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. ""The urban poor may not be that badly hit as some of them have cash in hand. But it's the villagers and people living in highlands and the fringes of forests who have been badly affected by the demonetisation,"" Khader said. ""Things would have been better had co-operative banks been allowed to accept old notes as they have a good presence in rural areas,"" he added. The minister said labourers in tea and coffee estates and the agriculture sector were also facing difficulties. ""Their employers don't have cash to pay wages,"" Khader said. Those who will buy grain and oil on credit will have to pay the due amount when they purchase rations in January. Their accounts in the computerised public distribution system will reflect the outstanding amount. ""I hope cash will be easily available by January,"" the minister said. The state offers Above Poverty Line (APL) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) ration cards, depending on the annual income of the beneficiary. APL card-holders get 5kg of rice and an equal amount of wheatfor Rs 15 and Rs 10, respectively, a month. BPL card-holders get 30kg of free rice, besides subsidised sugar and edible oil. Villagers with no cooking gas get kerosene as well. Both APL and BPL card-holders will get the credit facility. Khader said the credit facility would not burden the government. ""Once the card-holders pay back the dues, ration shop owners will have to deposit the amount to the government,"" he said. The government spends Rs 42 crore a month to provide rations to APL and BPL card-holders through a network of more than 20,000 ration shops. Karnataka has so far issued around 35 lakh APL card and nearly a crore BPL cards. Ration shops are gearing up to meet the likely rush of customers once the facility kicks in tomorrow. Manjunath, who works in a ration shop in the east Bangalore neighbourhood of Doopanahalli, said he was aware of the credit facility and would adhere to the government order. Nagrathnamma, who ekes out a living by selling snacks near a slum in Ulsoor, just a few kilometres from the upmarket MG Road, can't believe she can buy rations on credit. ""Let me get it first,"" the mother of two said. ""I am yet to purchase my rations this month as I don't have enough money after paying my son's school fees,"" she said, adding her daily earnings had dropped from over Rs 300 a day to Rs 60 yesterday as the cash crunch as hit street vendors as well."

Picture by Dev Raj A 12km stretch of road, which was swept away in the floods of 2007 and has not been repaired since, belies chief minister Nitish Kumar's claim to fame of having overhauled Bihar's infrastructure in general and roads in particular. The ""road"" connects Rampur village in Hasanpur block of Samastipur to big villages like Shasan and smaller ones like Bahattar and Gijri. It is a lifeline for farm produce from thousands of acres of fertile land, but the road exists just in remains here and there. The rest is broken, unfit for travel. Yet, vehicles and carts crawl through it as there is no other option. Old-timers say the road was a kuchcha one paved with terracotta bricks in 1985. It took 22 years to become a pucca (made of bitumen) one in March 2007; months later, floodwaters swept it away. The bits of the road that remain are being further eroded at a place where it touches a pond outside the village, and local people said the erosion during this rainy season was so high that they fear the road may vanish altogether during the rains next year. The sugarcane season is about to commence, and the road is the only route through which farmers of hundreds of villages in the hinterlands of Samastipur, Begusarai and Khagaria districts take their sugarcane produce to the New India Sugar Mills in Hasanpur - the only functional sugar mill in Samastipur and adjoining districts. ""Sugarcane-loaded tempos, tractors, trucks and bullock carts take this road to reach the sugar mill in Hasanpur. Several of them overturn despite moving slowly because the road has caved in at several places and is full of potholes. Many persons were injured, animals died and vehicles were damaged during the last cane season,"" said Maksudan Rai, a farmer from Rampur. It's not just machine and beast that suffer. ""I have often seen motorcycles and bicycles fall down and people getting injured. Though we rush to help them, we cannot do much except taking them to a hospital or home to rest. The government has not paid attention to the road for so many years,"" said Mohammad Mukhtar, a mason who doubles as a manual labourer. Another farmer Arun Kumar Rai pointed out that the road has been damaged in such a way that it is under knee-deep water during the monsoon, rendering it useless. ""I chant the name of God while moving on this road to ward off any mishap,"" said Rajendra Rai, who owns a tractor that he also hires out. The road is so important and the people are so desperate for it to be repaired that many local people pleaded with The Telegraph team with folded hands to get the work done, mistaking us for government officials. Rampur mukhiya Prashant Kumar Rai said the rural works department looks after the road. ""I have constructed around 6,400 feet of roads within our panchayat, but we all know that our place is poorly connected to nearby panchayats, Samastipur district headquarters and Begusarai town. The bigger roads are beyond our purview. Senior government officials, the local MLA and MP should pay attention to their repair and construction,"" Prashant said. The district headquarters town of Samastipur is around 62km from Rampur. Asked about the upkeep of the road, rural works department executive engineer Ratnesh Paswan, under whose jurisdiction the road is, accepted that it was in poor condition, but added that he was new to the area. ""It is a category-I road in importance because it connects block headquarters, railway station, hospitals and such other important installations and should be repaired on priority. I don't know whether proposals for repair have come or not. May be a detailed project report for its repair will be made later on,"" Ratnesh added."

To repeated queries from the Congress about his assurance before the elections to take over the unit and revive it, the Chief Minister said the government was willing to constitute an all-party committee to work out modalities relating to the takeover, including the payment that should be made for the current owners. The all-party committee could interact with the sugarcane farmers under the NSF and convince them to revert to sugarcane cultivation for reviving the plant. He said the government was keen on handing over the operations to farmers as the revived unit should not pose financial problems if the government took over its maintenance. He explained that several farmers who hitherto supplied cane to NSF shifted to alternative crops after the unit was handed over to private parties by the erstwhile TDP government. He explained how his government had made efforts to convince farmers to take over the industry on the lines of the sugar units operated by farmers cooperatives in Maharashtra. A delegation of 400 farmers was sent to study the situation in Maharashtra, but it refused to accept the governments offer for taking it over. Reopening the factory alone does not suffice. The units would need raw material and that is why the government is keen on ensuring that operation and maintenance of the industry is taken over by the farmers, he said."

Picture by Dev Raj Ever since The Telegraph arrived in Patna in July 2010, the paper has been publishing a report card on the performance of the state government coinciding with chief minister Nitish Kumar's own exercise. Whenever our report cards came out, there were ministers who complained that we had under-scored their performance. There were complaints from Opposition members that we have given some ministers undeserved marks (often complaints came from ministers about their colleagues). This year we have done it differently. The Telegraph has gone to the grassroots by selecting one remote village randomly and asked its residents what has changed in the last 11 years. We chose Rampur, not the village in the Randhir Kapoor hit of the seventies, but a hamlet in Samastipur. Rampur is neither Phulwaria nor Kalyan Bigha - homes of powerful politicians - which can boast of a helipad, railway station and near urban-like government offices and schools. It is just another faceless village one might pass by without giving it a second glance. Located 145km away from Patna on the eastern side and 62km from the district headquarters town of Samastipur, the village has a mixed population of around 7,000 living in about 1,200 households. Like most villages, the residents survive on agriculture. The only thing working for it is the fact that the district's lone sugar mill - Hassanpur Sugar Mill - is located nearby and sugarcane is the cash crop. On Sunday, Nitish is set to place his new report card - the first of the Grand Alliance government and the 11th since he took over as chief minister in November 2005 - before the people. Right from the day he was sworn in 11 years ago till today, development has been Nitish's key word - he has always projected himself as the Vikas Purush (development man) of Bihar. When he first came to power in 2005, roads and healthcare were his focus areas. He promised to make the roads so good that people could reach Patna from any corner of the state within six hours. The roads have improved though the six-hour deadline is still to be met. Even in the health sector, the condition of government health units were so bad that less than a dozen patients ventured inside them. Today, the numbers have climbed dramatically - on an average the number of patients visiting a government health centre has risen to 3,000 per day. To be fair these improvements were possible due to massive investment in infrastructure, particularly roads and health, by the then UPA government. Of late, there have been complaints of decline, though it is still much better than pre-2005 levels. After being voted back to power in 2010, Nitish focused on electricity, promising not to seek votes if he were not able to improve the power situation. Today the power availability in Bihar has risen and so has consumption. That is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi's question ""Bijli Aayee?"" at rallies during the 2015 Assembly polls found no takers and prompted incredulous stares from those in the crowds. When Nitish came to power, over 35 lakh children were out of school and he went in for a massive teacher recruitment drive. The quality of teachers appointed is questionable but Bihar did see new school buildings being built and children being enrolled in them. His cycle and uniform yojana clicked with enrolment of girl students in schools. Again, this was possible with investment from the Centre. In spite of these successes, there are complaints of corruption becoming more rampant and law and order taking a beating. The perception of falling law and order has largely been built on high profile cases such as the release on bail of Mohammad Shahabuddin, the alleged rape by an RJD MLA Raj Ballabh Prasad and the road rage murder by a son of a JDU MLC. The Telegraph's effort has been to get the feedback from the ground and not depend just on statistics prepared by state officials. The people of this faceless hamlet of Rampur responded to the queries of The Telegraph and assessed if the slogan ""Naya Bihar, Nitish Kumar"" raised before the 2005 Assembly election was just another slogan or it has made a difference to them."

In 2013, considering the prevailing situation, the then Chief Minister had declared districts, including Chennai as drought-hit. Likewise, considering the present situation, the government must declare similarly.Alleging that the Centre was reducing the funds for implementing MNREGA scheme, Mr. Mutharasan said the workers under the scheme should be given work throughout the year and the daily wage must be increased to Rs. 400 a day.Waiving of farmer loans in view of natural disaster, clearing of pending insurance claims, payment of dues from private sugar mills and increasing State-advised price for sugarcane to Rs. 4,000 a tonne, were among the demands."
58e54bc8a3d24b500504b2da,It is the season to be nostalgic,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/It-is-the-season-to-be-nostalgic/article16941084.ece,2016-12-25,"Festivals may be our last link to an age of innocence, a time of our life when it is perfectly all right to gorge on our favourite food, wear new clothes and thank the divine force that made our joy possible.The mood may be perky, but the celebration has changed. We no longer buy greeting cards to send to family and friends, nor do we trudge from shop to shop looking for the perfect new set of clothes. Even the traditional festive banquet can be outsourced if necessary.Before Christmas became globalised, it was still seen as a time for reflection and neighbourly bonhomie.That is why perhaps, the best experience of the festival for many people, is the one shaped by a period of simplicity in their lives.As someone who has adapted to the changing modes of celebrating Christmas, Tiruchi resident and former Holy Cross College lecturer Christine Gomez still holds on to a few traditions of the season. And yes, it starts with a signature dish. My mothers Christmas favourite was Pundhol , a kind of cake made in her native village Manapad, Kerala, with eggs, semolina, sugar and nutmeg. My mother-in-law made her villages version of cake or rather a steamed pudding called vattilappam , made with coconut milk, sugar and roasted gram flour, eggs and a touch of cinnamon or cardamom. My Christmas staple is fruit cake, which has evolved through the years, she says.Earlier, snack-making used to be a community affair. Women of four or five families, mostly relatives, would gather in one of their homes to prepare a snack like Murukku or Seepaniyam , right from the extraction of coconut milk, and the preparation of the dough up to the frying, draining, cooling and packing of the snack.There was much socialising, chatting and even matchmaking in these get-togethers, which would be repeated in every one of their homes, until all the families had a stock of all the snacks.The 15 days that she spends in preparing to bake her Christmas fruit cake is usually a close-knit family affair these days. The placing of the crib and recreation of the Nativity scene is yet another ritual that Mrs. Gomez recalls with fondness.A vivid childhood memory is of a crib put up by my father, in which the shadow of the cribs window frame fell on the Babe in the shape of a cross, she says.Both my husband and I, as children, have watched elders painting newspapers in shades of brown, grey and cream and then shaping them as rocks for the cave in which they placed in the manger.In the 1950s and 60s, schools used to close by the 15th of December, recalls Eugene DVaz, so families in Tiruchi had time to prepare for the festival.In the Anglo-Indian tradition, We put up a Christmas tree which was usually a big branch of a switch tree and then decorated it with tinsel, baubles and little made-up toys. Every house flaunted a star, which again was made up of bamboo sticks stuck together with kite paper and electric bulb inside, he says.Every Saturday night, groups of children, youngsters and the elderly went to every house starting from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., singing Christmas carols. The midnight service in the churches used to be packed with worshippers dressed in newly tailored clothes, says Mr. DVaz, who has turned to creative writing and graphic art after a long career as an English professor in St. Josephs College.As children we waited for our toys (which were supposed to be brought in the night by Santa Claus), while the grown-ups got ready to attend the week-long night dances, dancing from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.Christmas has always been more a community festival, rather than only a religious one, feels Mr. DVaz. The post offices were flooded with greeting cards to be delivered. Christmas day was fun, full of indoor games, wishing and kissing, and relishing the best of Anglo-Indian cuisine. It culminated in a grand fancy-dress ball.The exodus of Anglo-Indians from the city from the 1960s has dimmed the brightness of the festive season for the community, feels Mr. DVaz. As I know the Christmas season has shrunk to a day, with feeble attempts being made to continue the old tradition. We can live through these glorious times only in our memory and imagination.Multicultural and secularFor eye surgeon Dr. Shibu Varkey, who spent his childhood years in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1970s and 80s, Christmas used to be a time for multicultural celebrations. We had Christian families from Burma, Kerala and Jharkhand staying in the Andamans then. Each of these communities would showcase their traditions during Christmas  with songs, tribal dances and so on. All of us would light candles and take part in the Prakash Yatra (Journey of Light), a march from one end of Port Blair to the other, with a Christmas tableau and carolers in the night. We were so cut off from the mainland that any festival would be reason for celebration for every family. Religion hardly mattered, recalls Dr. Varkey.The festive meal at home prepared by his mother would consist of Syrian Christian delicacies  a long line of non-vegetarian dishes featuring beef, chicken and mutton that started off with Appam and stew and ended with payasam, he recalls. Biryani became the Christmas lunch staple much later.Being isolated from the mainland meant that everything needed for the celebrations was made by hand. Whether it was the costumes for the plays or the decorations, everyone would chip in to help out. We boys used to make stars by cutting up bamboo stems and sticking them with home-cooked glue, for all the houses in the area. Children were given tasks according to their age. Everyone used to be very busy preparing for the festive season.Mrs. Sathyasulochana Yogendran migrated to Tiruchi from Sri Lanka in the 1980s and since then has enjoyed celebrating Christmas with friends from her church. My congregation members decorate my home for me ahead of Christmas and take very good care of me, says 78-year-old Mrs. Yogendran, who hasnt let a vision impairment and osteoarthritis deter her from living alone.I grew up in a household with many servants, so I never really learned how to cook, she laughs, as she recalls her pampered life in Jaffna. Here too, I have ordered biryani to be delivered for Christmas lunch. I am gifting 20 of my friends and helpers fruit cakes from a local bakery.A cheerful soul, she calls Christmas a day of blessing. I feel happy I have been given such wonderful friends in Tiruchi, and that I am able to do something for them in return for all that they have done for me since I came here.Before Christmas became globalised, it was still seen as a time for reflection and neighbourly bonhomie"

The circular reveals its mischievous game plan, alleged FFA State president Mangati Gopal Reddy.While the undivided State had 18 sugar factories in the cooperative sector, it came down to 11 post bifurcation.With 25-30 lakh tonnes, Chittoor district ranks first in terms of annual cane production. Though the private players make profits, the cooperative factories always end up in losses, said Lok Satta State general secretary K. Balasubramanyam.The government will pay heed only if all cane-growers join hands, said K. Kumar Reddy and A. Rama Naidu, Chittoor district secretaries of the CPI(M) and CPI respectively."

Photo: M. Srinath: Farmers in Erode district have questioned the rationale behind the government fixing the State Advisory Price (SAP) for the current cutting season when mills have been refusing to comply with it for quite some time.The State governments retention of last years SAP of Rs. 550 per tonne, inclusive of transport cost of Rs. 100, in addition to the Centre's Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 2,300, they say, was a blow to the cultivators reeling under drought conditions.This year, sugarcane fields had dried up in several hundred acres due to the failure of the monsoon, and in many places, farmers had incurred heavy expenditure arranging for water to salvage crops. Against this backdrop, farmers have accused the State government of leniency towards the mills while being harsh on the cultivators.Since 2013 when the Rangarajan Committee Recommendations were released, mills have been of the opinion that the Central government intends to do away with the SAP.One of the recommendations of the committee was to scrap the SAP at the first stage and share 70 per cent of the combined sold value of sugar, molasses, bagasse and press mud at the second stage. But, the mills had chosen to keep the second stage requirement under wraps while studiously refusing to pay the SAP, a representative of a farmers association said.At a time when sugar is sold in excess of Rs. 40 per kg in the open market, the decision to keep the procurement cost stagnant was ridiculous, according to K.V. Ponnaiyan, president of Tamil Nadu Swadeshi Farmers Movement.The governments silence over the Rs. 1,500-crore payment backlog on account of SAP arrears (to be paid by mills to farmers) over the last three years was intriguing, Mr. Ponnaiyan said.However, Palani G. Periasamy, president of South India Sugar Mills Association, said the private sugar mills in the State had incurred loss to the tune of Rs. 13,500 crore in the last three years and were finding it difficult to pay even the FRP.Sugar priceThe sugar prices were up only for the last three or four months and this would not address the fundamental problems faced by the industry. We are asking the government to convene a tripartite meeting and bring in a revenue-sharing model. Cane availability is poor this year and sugar production is expected to decline by 33 per cent.Under these circumstances, we appeal to the government to introduce and implement a revenue-sharing system, he said.(with inputs fromM.

Under this, the salt was to be sold at subsidised rates. The districts which had been selected at that stage were based on high incidence of cases of anemia among children below 5 years of age. Now the scheme will be extended to other districts of UP. The process is expected to begin by the end of this month,"" said Agra district civil supplies officer B K Shukla.Low sodium and anemia are a result of inadequate intake of dietary salt.

This is in addition to subsidized wheat, rice and sugar which are already available at ration shops across the state.Under the scheme, the rate of salt for above poverty line (APL) card holders will be Rs 6 per kg, while BPL and Antyodaya card holders will get the salt at Rs 3 per kg."
