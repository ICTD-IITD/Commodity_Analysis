Pawar has completed 50 years of either being an MLA or MP, which is a legacy in itself in Indian politics. I have no hesitation in accepting that Pawar held my hand and taught me to walk in my early days in Gujarat, said Modi, adding he has always put farmers and agriculture first.Modi congratulated the NCP chief in advance for completing 50 years in electoral politics, saying he had shown the way to lead political life. Pawar will be completing five decades in electoral politics in February 2017.Pawar, too, praised Modi. I get surprised by the way Modi works. Yesterday, he was in Japan and in the morning he went to Goa. In the afternoon, Modi came to Belgaum and now he is at VSI. I dont know where he is going in the night, Pawar said, amid laughter from the audience. This shows his total commitment to the cause of the country.This is the second time in two years that Modi visited an institution headed by Pawar and shared the dias with him. In February 2015, Modi visited Baramati, Pawars hometown, to inaugurate a Krishi Vigyan Kendra building and had lunch at Pawars home."

Retinopathy may occur over time owing to elevated blood sugar levels.The symptoms do not show for many years from the onset of the disease. That is one of the reasons for poor awareness, said Dr Girish Parmar, consultant endocrinologist, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri. Patients visit doctors only when symptoms such as bleeding in the eye and loss of vision show. Unfortunately, nothing can be done to correct this, he added.Dr Tejas Shah, endocrinologist from Malad, said 20% of all his patients with diabetes have retinopathy. The only solutions for retinopathy are lasers and injections. These do not correct vision loss but prevent further damage, he added.Doctors said diabetics must get their eyes checked by a certified ophthalmologist at least once a year. Vision loss is irreversible. Diabetics must prevent as much damage as possible, said Dr Snehal Tanna, diabetologist, Jupiter Hospital, Thane."

58f10c6aa3d24b245e5952e2,"Amid a ‘water death’, thirst economy thrives in Latur",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Amid-a-water-death-thirst-economy-thrives-in-Latur/articleshow/51666134.cms,2016-04-03,"LATUR: When Natabai Tenkale keeled over and died in a queue for water at her slum colony's pipeline, the tragedy earned a new tag in the parched city of Latur: ""water death"".With the city's water supply reduced to a trickle, the 55-year old had been lining up at 4 am for weeks to fill pots of water. On March 6th soon after receiving the day's supply, she had a heart attack. ""The sheer exhaustion of doing this every night was too much for her,"" says her daughter-in-law Sangeeta.Located in drought-struck Marathwada, Latur city is experiencing its most intense water crisis. Many say this is the region's worst calamity after the 1993 Latur earthquake.In March, as public tempers frayed, the administration banned the people from gathering along water filling points and tanker routes for three weeks.The prohibitory orders were lifted on April 1, but the mood remains tense.Latur city's nearly 5 lakh population has lived with water shortages for 15 years. In 2015, it received tap water only every two or three weeks.Yet for the first time, all its taps shut down on February 22nd when the Dhanegaon dam dried up completely. Against the norm of 80 million litres per day required for its population, Latur city is now managing with just 20 million litres per day.The entire city now receives water mainly through tankers. But municipal tankers deliver water only once every 6-8 days. And the limit is merely 200 litres per family. This means some families receive the water only once every fortnight or month.When the long-awaited civic tanker arrives at Kaligalli, a scuffle erupts. ""We didn't get any municipal water for the entire month. By the time the tanker reaches us, the water is always over. Those who do dada-giri get the water,"" complains resident Sonali Devkar. Residents say they cannot bathe more than once or twice a week.The gap in supply has pushed people increasingly into the hands of Latur's lucrative water market. Most residents end up paying between Rs 1000-2000 per month to buy water. Compared to 70 government tankers, there are an estimated 800 private tankers and 100 private bottled water plants.""The water market in Latur has a turnover of at least Rs 50 lakh a day. It has gone up 10 times in the last year alone,"" says Atul Deulgaonkar of the Forum of Environmental Journalists of India, based in Latur.""Tankers have doubled their rates and there is no control over spurious bottled water,"" he adds. Water supplied in a 6,000 litre tankers now costs Rs 900 compared to Rs 500 last year.At a well near the India Nagar slum, desperate residents who cannot afford to buy water, line up. The water that emerges is swimming with dead insects and even a few small fish. ""I buy drinking water. Water from the well is used to bathe and clean the house. If there is an insect in the bucket, I just flick it off,""says local cook Narsing Kolpe.The water crisis has also hit hotels, hospitals and industry. ""Twenty per cent of our dal and sugar mills have shut down. In the rest, productivity is down by 70%,""says Chandu Baladawa of the Latur District Industries Association. With construction at a halt, allied businesses like stone-crushing and cement-mixing have also shut down.Officials say there is enough water to last Latur city till the monsoon. ""Latur needs 20 million litres of water a day. We get 15 million from borewells and another 4 million litres from nearby dams and barrages. The water will last at least till July 31st,"" says Latur municipal Commissoner Sudhakar Telang. The Indian Railways have also offered trains to carry water to Latur.Meanwhile, there are already signs of coming conflicts. Tankers in Latur city have to travel over 30 km away to tap water sources in Dongargaon and Malkunji. In March, villagers in both locations opposed their water being taken away for Latur city. For a week, tankers going to Dongargaon were given police protection.Critics warn that unless urgent steps are taken, Latur will be a tinderbox by the peak of summer. ""Officials need to be hands-on and there must be better water management. Latur city has 80% water leakages,"" points out Deulgaonkar. ""After the Latur earthquake, there was a strong response from the government and civil society. This water crisis is more widespread and on-going but there is not much response from the government,"" he points out."
58f10edea3d24b245e59543c,Narsingh out to prove why he's the man India should bank on,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/rio-2016-olympics/news/wrestling/Narsingh-out-to-prove-why-hes-the-man-India-should-bank-on/articleshow/53349631.cms,2016-07-23,"A newspaper flutters in the mild air-conditioner breeze of Yogeshwar Dutt's Type IV quarters at the SAI Centre in Sonepat. Prominent in the crinkled paper is an announcement for this year's Eid release at the nearby multiplex. There's Salman Khan in his rustic wrestler's avatar half completing his dangal manoeuvre over some hapless opponent, there's the akhara sand flying all over for effect. The newspaper gently flutters, Salman too looks as if he's trembling. Intriguingly, irrespective of where you are sitting in Yogeshwar's drawing room, Salman the Pehalwan always seems upside down to you. It's like the Mona Lisa at the Louvre effect - any which way you look at it, it follows you.It is a slightly strange setting. Yogeshwar, in all his pocket-sized hulkiness, 28-inched at the waist, super shape and supremely-fit - the real deal - regards the scene with his typically quiet, sullen disdain. ""Shaaddi kisi ki, baraati koi, aur dulha koi,"" he says dismissively as if he has no time for such trivialities anymore. But uttered in his heavily-accented Haryanvi, he makes it sound all the more menacing, or comical, depending on where you stand on the Salman-Olympics ambassador issue. It was Yogeshwar who waded in headlong when the actor was controversially appointed goodwill ambassador for the Indian Olympic contingent, questioning why no sportsman was seen fit enough to be accorded the honour. He merely nods at the recent memory, not impatient, just having risen above it all.But it also immediately sets Yogeshwar apart in this whole Rio Olympics business. You could say, there's a strange Salmanization of Yogeshwar himself. It's difficult to explain how. For one, there are very few or no hangers on, but there hangs in the air a strange broodiness to Dutt that would be very typical of a Salman. The only time he breaks out into an automatic grin all day is when you comment that his Body Mass Index (BMI) would be at the lowest ever. ""No, it is still around 6,"" he says, clearly aware of how the hours spent in the gym have so spectacularly borne fruit.Without the entourage - an aspect that is so Sushil Kumar, -Yogeshwar is his own lone wolf. He seems to have wrested this mantle of the alpha male of the wrestling contingent with a quiet glee, almost as if he was waiting for the Sushil-Narsingh issue to blow up like it did, and pave the path for his elevation, as it were. ""We don't speak to each other anymore,"" he says simply, a hint of a lisp adding to the accent, on the broken friendship with Sushil. ""It was a long friendship, but that's not the case anymore. I haven't had the time also to mend any broken bridges and I just want to focus on myself. I haven't wished badly on anyone till now, and I think I'm fine where I am, so I haven't spoken to Sushil about mending things."" End of story .But it is also his strangely controversial stands, especially his poem on the JNU-Govt stand-off following the Afzal Guru sloganeering, make him something of a Twitter-vigilante, or a loose cannon, again depending on where you stand. Ironically, it makes him perhaps the only Indian sportsman who speaks out on issues, while the sense of the misguided is a throwback to the ways of the man whose appointment as his Olympic contingent's brand ambassador he so memorably questioned. ""Shaaddi kisi ki, baraati koi, aur dulha koi.""But then, we digress. Simply, Yogeshwar Dutt is in the prime form of his life. He is our one big medal hope for Rio.He pulled a muscle in his back during the morning sparring with old friend, rival and confidante Bajrangi. There was the usual silent commotion that follows such a mid-mat interruption. The impassive physio pressed and pinched trying to locate the knot, ice was crushed in an old towel and applied while others looked on and spoke in hushed tones. Bajrangi looked so worried as if he would break down but then, that could be his everyday face. ""Hota hai,"" Yogeshwar waved off the concern later, in true Bhai-style. There was nothing that could deter him to climb off his zone, where he seems so comfortably nestled in at the moment.""The day I won that bronze in London, I set myself a target, which was to claim gold at the Olympics. I wasn't satisfied with third place, and if I wanted to win gold in 2016 in Rio, I would have to begin preparations immediately. Before 2012, the dream was to just win an Olympic medal, and that disappointment of not getting gold in London has spurred me on to this day,"" he says.For someone who only first learnt of Olympics as an idea when Leander Paes won the bronze in 1996, Yogeshwar himself is a veteran of sorts. Rio will be his fourth Games and turning into a monk each time comes naturally to him now. ""I had three operations in 2015, and I was out of action for almost the whole year, but when I was injured or free from training, I was just thinking about how to prepare for Rio, how to build my legs, how to improve my strength. I also changed my weight category from 60kg to 65kg. But I did win gold at the 2014 Asian Games, and gold at any other event that I participated in. That gave me the confidence that I can do well in the 65kg category.""Kuch paane ke liye, kuch khona padta hai,"" he informs us. He says, as part of a carb-free diet, he hasn't eaten a roti in nearly two months now; there is paneer and fruits without the juice to eliminate the sugar intake. His diet is bland, he hates it, but he does it.""After the 2014 Asian Games gold, I made quite a few changes. My diet, then I started avoiding lots of things. I never went out much anyways. I rarely went home, maybe on Sundays I'd go and meet my mother and house-folk for 2, 3 hours, then I'd sleep and leave for the training centre in the morning. Talk is less. I've even asked them not to come to meet me unless there is an emergency . My phone is also switched off, and I only use it if some important work comes up.""I want that Rio gold so badly..."""

Our support will be given to the party that will accept our demand,"" said Rajaram.Rajaram said the demand for coconut oil had come down in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, but the production was high. He wanted the state government to allow production of neera in order to lend a helping hand to the ailing coconut farmers and claimed that the farmer can earn Rs 1,500 per tree every month instead of Rs 1,500 per year through tender coconut. He asked the government to take the cue from Kerala, which has several neera processing centres.Coconut trees are abundant predominantly in Coimbatore, Pollachi, Thanjavur, Orathanadu, Pattukottai. More than 10 lakh families are said to be involved in the business.The Tamil Nadu Toddy Movement, batting for the lifting of ban on toddy in Tamil Nadu, said neera was not liquor and has no colouring, chemical and preservative. ""Unfermented toddy is a healthy food, which was endorsed by Mahatma Gandhi and Thanthai Periyar. Unlike liquor, toddy will save consumers from many health hazards. So the ban on toddy in the state is totally unnecessary,"" said the organiser of the movement S Nallasamy.Nallasamy said sugar made from neera would be of high quality and priced at Rs 400 per kg. ""Neera production will boost the economy of the state,"" he said.To reinforce their stand, Rajaram plans to purchase neera from Kerala and sell it near the Trichy central bus stand on April 16."

For one, there are very few or no hangers on, but there hangs in the air a strange broodiness to Dutt that would be very typical of a Salman. The only time he breaks out into an automatic grin all day is when you comment that his Body Mass Index (BMI) would be at the lowest ever. ""No, it is still around 6,"" he says, clearly aware of how the hours spent in the gym have so spectacularly borne fruit.Without the entourage - an aspect that is so Sushil Kumar, -Yogeshwar is his own lone wolf. He seems to have wrested this mantle of the alpha male of the wrestling contingent with a quiet glee, almost as if he was waiting for the Sushil-Narsingh issue to blow up like it did, and pave the path for his elevation, as it were. ""We don't speak to each other anymore,"" he says simply, a hint of a lisp adding to the accent, on the broken friendship with Sushil. ""It was a long friendship, but that's not the case anymore. I haven't had the time also to mend any broken bridges and I just want to focus on myself. I haven't wished badly on anyone till now, and I think I'm fine where I am, so I haven't spoken to Sushil about mending things."" End of story .But it is also his strangely controversial stands, especially his poem on the JNU-Govt stand-off following the Afzal Guru sloganeering, make him something of a Twitter-vigilante, or a loose cannon, again depending on where you stand. Ironically, it makes him perhaps the only Indian sportsman who speaks out on issues, while the sense of the misguided is a throwback to the ways of the man whose appointment as his Olympic contingent's brand ambassador he so memorably questioned. ""Shaaddi kisi ki, baraati koi, aur dulha koi.""But then, we digress. Simply, Yogeshwar Dutt is in the prime form of his life. He is our one big medal hope for Rio.He pulled a muscle in his back during the morning sparring with old friend, rival and confidante Bajrangi. There was the usual silent commotion that follows such a mid-mat interruption. The impassive physio pressed and pinched trying to locate the knot, ice was crushed in an old towel and applied while others looked on and spoke in hushed tones. Bajrangi looked so worried as if he would break down but then, that could be his everyday face. ""Hota hai,"" Yogeshwar waved off the concern later, in true Bhai-style. There was nothing that could deter him to climb off his zone, where he seems so comfortably nestled in at the moment.""The day I won that bronze in London, I set myself a target, which was to claim gold at the Olympics. I wasn't satisfied with third place, and if I wanted to win gold in 2016 in Rio, I would have to begin preparations immediately. Before 2012, the dream was to just win an Olympic medal, and that disappointment of not getting gold in London has spurred me on to this day,"" he says.For someone who only first learnt of Olympics as an idea when Leander Paes won the bronze in 1996, Yogeshwar himself is a veteran of sorts. Rio will be his fourth Games and turning into a monk each time comes naturally to him now. ""I had three operations in 2015, and I was out of action for almost the whole year, but when I was injured or free from training, I was just thinking about how to prepare for Rio, how to build my legs, how to improve my strength. I also changed my weight category from 60kg to 65kg. But I did win gold at the 2014 Asian Games, and gold at any other event that I participated in. That gave me the confidence that I can do well in the 65kg category.""Kuch paane ke liye, kuch khona padta hai,"" he informs us. He says, as part of a carb-free diet, he hasn't eaten a roti in nearly two months now; there is paneer and fruits without the juice to eliminate the sugar intake. His diet is bland, he hates it, but he does it.""After the 2014 Asian Games gold, I made quite a few changes. My diet, then I started avoiding lots of things. I never went out much anyways. I rarely went home, maybe on Sundays I'd go and meet my mother and house-folk for 2, 3 hours, then I'd sleep and leave for the training centre in the morning. Talk is less. I've even asked them not to come to meet me unless there is an emergency . My phone is also switched off, and I only use it if some important work comes up.""I want that Rio gold so badly..."""

There was no trace of the suspected heavily-armed men in Army dungarees even after more than 24 hours of their being first spotted by two villagers on Thursday.""There is no confirmation of any suspected militant so far but our search operation is going on,"" border range deputy inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh told TOI on Thursday.Security agencies have been carrying out aerial and ground surveys since morning to locate the position of suspected terrorists in the area situated close to highly-sensitive Tibri Cantonment. Earlier, in the day police had sealed all roads going towards Pandher village and traffic on Gurdaspur-Mukerian road was diverted. Besides Army's armoured vehicles, troops of BSF and Punjab Police's SWAT team had cordoned off the area around nearly 20-25 acres of sugarcane fields. Later, they extended the search operation to a larger area.Though no senior officer confirmed about the presence of two suspected terrorists, they gave indication of having received clues about the hidden militants. ""One strategy behind the long operation is to nab them alive so we are patiently waiting for possible response,"" said sources.Pandher village residents Satnam Singh and Rajinder Singh had informed the local police about two suspected militants in a sugarcane field when they had gone to fetch fodder for their cattle on Wednesday afternoon.Sources said that the two villagers claimed to have seen the suspected terrorists at around 2.30pm and informed police at around 3.30pm. It took nearly 45 minutes for the police to reach the spot. ""These two hours were crucial and gave time to the suspected terrorists to move out,"" said sources.Due to pitch darkness and thick fog, the search operation couldn't be carried out at night. Many farmers grow sugarcane to supply to a sugar mill at Mukerian, about 17km from Bhullechak."

The factory had taken loan from different institutions amounting to a total of Rs 173 crore, including Rs 64 crore from the KDCC.The KDCC had floated a tender seven times to lease the factory in the past. It is for the first time that someone has approached the bank to run the factory on lease, bank officials said.""The factory is unable to pay the loan of Rs 64 crore taken from KDCC.

The cancer spread to his liver, and the family chose to discontinue treatment in a hospital this week.""We decided to bring him home,"" Guadamuz-Davis said. ""He was in my arms.""In the 1976 Olympics, Davis was voted the outstanding boxer, out-polling his teammates Leonard, and Michael and Leon Spinks.His mother died three days before the Montreal Games, and he considered withdrawing. Instead, he stayed, and dedicated his lightweight gold medal to his mother's memory.""It was devastating,"" Davis told the New York Post in August. ""But I remembered her pointing her finger in my face and telling me, `You'd better win the gold medal.' I wasn't going to be denied. There was no way I was going to lose.""Davis was considered by many to be better than Leonard on the star-studded 1976 American team. As a pro, however, his career never matched his Olympic exploits.The gold medal awarded to Davis was a story unto itself. According to Olympic historian David Wallechinsky, the medal was stolen in 1981 from Davis' Long Island home but the robber apparently tossed it from his car while fleeing police.Ten years later, a highway landscaper came across a piece of metal while at work. He cleaned it up and used it for a paperweight for the next four years. In 1991, a visitor to the landscaper's home recognized the paperweight for what it was. The landscaper, Jake Fiesel, tracked down Davis and called him. The boxer was finally reunited with his medal.Davis retired from boxing in 1996 with a professional record of 36-6-1 with 14 knockouts, according to his biography on the Howard Davis Jr. Foundation's website.Davis went on to train mixed martial arts fighters, including Chuck Liddell, who posted an image of an undated Polaroid showing him with Davis on his Instagram account on Thursday. ""A great coach and good friend. Rest in peace my brother,"" Liddell wrote. Davis had signed the picture and added, ""Hard work always pays off!""He and his wife promoted mixed martial arts fights through their Florida-based company, Fight Time Promotions.Davis continued to offer coaching advice even as a promoter, heading into the locker room after a bout in his suit to sit with a bloodied fighter and talk about boxing technique, Guadamuz-Davis said.""I could hear him saying, 'You've got to keep your hands up,' or, 'Listen, this is your last fight.' Promoters don't usually do that,"" she said. ""He thought it was his duty to make sure the fighters take care of themselves.""Davis was born on Feb. 14, 1956, in Glen Cove, New York. He was the eldest of 10 children, and his father ran a local youth center and trained amateur and professional boxers.According to his foundation, Davis was inspired to become a boxer after seeing the documentary ""AKA Cassius Clay"" as a teenager.Davis' family has scheduled a public memorial service in Fort Lauderdale on Jan. 7. He is survived by his wife and numerous children and siblings."

Servants circled around to the backs of the vehicles and unloaded, ever so carefully, the animals everyone had come to see.There were greyhounds from Canada, from Ireland and England, and a few from the United States. The track of plain tractor-groomed dirt belied the colossal investment represented by the dogs, many of which are housed in airconditioned kennels and fed buttermilk and chicken.Dogs are a big deal in this part of Punjab, about 20 miles from the border with Pakistan. So is single-malt Scotch, skeet shooting and wild-boar pickle. The guardians of these traditions can be found seated in a row of chairs arranged at the finish line: wealthy Sikh landowners who, despite the Indian government's attempts to dismantle the feudal system, are keeping alive the ways of the maharajahs and nawabs who came before them.A trainer loads his greyhound at the property of Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon before heading off to the races in Faridkot. (NYT photo by Daniel Berehulak)One of the most prominent among them, Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, was scanning the track for a glimpse of a 17-month-old brindle bitch named Baby Doll. This was complicated, at times, by the number of young men coming by to bend down and touch his feet.""All the big families are into dogs,"" said Dhillon, who is known as Kiki. ""You import the best dog. You have the best handler. It's not the horse competing, or the dog competing. It's the man's name competing.""Dhillon estimates the cost of a top greyhound at half-a-million rupees (about $7,500). This is a fraction of what he will pay for a Marwari stallion, a Perazzi shotgun or a big-game hunt in South Africa, but, still, it adds up.""Very few families have been left with all this, I'll be very frank,"" he said. ""This is a bit of an expensive thing, the dogs, their upkeep.""The trainers arrive first, laying thick blankets on the ground for the greyhounds, which bruise easily. Then come the dogs' owners, recognizable by their quilted vests and Gucci sunglasses, walking at the head of V-shaped formations of cousins, like geese.Men take in the greyhound races in Faridkot. (NYT photo by Daniel Berehulak)Many wealthy families here own chains of gas stations in the United States or Canada, and most have relatives there. One imposing man, who turned out to be a police officer, explained in rapid-fire fashion that ""I am doing duty as a gunman for Kiki Dhillon"" and that ""my in-laws are settled in Modesto (California).""Like every aspect of life here, dog racing was violently interrupted by the partition in 1947, which divided Punjab and forced Sikh landowners to choose between living in the Muslim state of Pakistan, and possibly being forced to convert, or parting with vast tracts of land that were now under the new state.Those who chose India had to contend with a government intent on land redistribution; in 1972, new laws banned ownership of plots of irrigated land exceeding seven hectares (about 17 acres) and, to add insult to injury, outlawed hunting. Greyhounds, as a result, can be legally raced only using a mechanical lure, in this case a bedraggled dead rabbit affixed to a dinner plate.Dhillon's 95-year-old uncle, Karam Singh Dhillon, ran the hounds with the maharajah of Faridkot as a young man, and could recall the king's horsemen galloping into the fields and planting red pennants to denote the presence of a rabbit.Greyhounds hurtle toward the finish line at a meet in Faridkot. (NYT photo by Daniel Berehulak)The older Dhillon had agreed to attend Monday's race out of affection for the dogs, but when asked his opinion, grimaced as if he had just eaten a lemon.""This is a nonsense thing,"" he said. ""It is not a race.""He acknowledged that hunting was being phased out in many places, including England, where, as he put it, ""The people in Parliament, they cry like children, they say 'I don't want'.""Feudal ways have clung stubbornly here, nevertheless, in part because a family's land can be registered piecemeal, or under multiple names  the younger Dhillon reckons his family controls more than 300 acres, though exact figures are understood to be confidential. Meanwhile, old-line landowning families dominate party politics (Punjab's most popular politician, former chief minister Capt. Amarinder Singh, was the heir to the former princely state of Patiala.)Even without the benefit of elected office, the scions of old families serve as a kind of shadow government. Dhillon is an excellent example. Though he lost his most recent parliamentary election, he still spends several hours a day receiving petitioners who wait on his terrace, bringing him their problems and occasionally asking him to settle disputes. They refer to him as ""sardar,"" akin to ""chieftain.""""Communism was never a hit in North India,"" he said. Dhillon's family owns interstate buses and trades in liquor, but he spends most of his time on politics. He has four cellphones, two of which are in the possession of his personal secretary, and they ring approximately every 5 minutes, including when he is on horseback.Spectators lean in for a better look at the greyhound races in Faridkot. (NYT photo by Daniel Berehulak)""The main job for politicians is not to make laws, the main job is to go to social functions,"" he said, a little wearily. ""There are all these deaths.""Dog races offer some relief from this routine. A man turns a crank, the dead rabbit scoots down the track on a wire and two dogs shoot out at a full gallop, their spines flexing like springs. Dust rises around the men along the track: farmers with deeply lined faces; New Jersey gas station moguls; one princeling in aviator sunglasses who described himself happily as ""that type of guy, you give me $100,000, I guarantee within two, three days, I am spending every penny.""Dhillon, seated beside a race official, was fretting a bit over his dogs. His favorite, Messi, though ""bloody fast"", had apparently lost enthusiasm when he realized the rabbit was mechanical. He blamed his trainers for overexerting Messi's sister, Smarty, which he considers ""the fastest bitch in Punjab,"" and instructed them to raise the body weight of a third sibling, Ronaldo, by seven pounds.In the end, Monday's top prizes went to the dogs belonging to Punjabis living in North America; one of them, an electrical engineer, lives outside Detroit and raced a dog from West Virginia. Back on his veranda at his home, Dhillon said he was no stranger to disappointment; last year, he was preparing to travel to Ireland for a coursing championship, in which dogs chase a live rabbit, when his dog broke a leg in training and had to be euthanized.""They are like glass, you never know when they will crack,"" he said. ""You put all this effort into them and after two races they bloody crash.""Anyway, there was plenty to look forward to. The authorities in some areas of Punjab have categorized wild boar as vermin. This allows hunters to drive the boars into fields of sugar cane, send a pack of hounds to flush them out, and wait on the periphery with shotguns. A friend who had come for the dog races offered, as he left, to send over a pair of gray partridges, and Dhillon's face brightened.""Give me a pair of white peacocks,"" he said. ""I'd love to have them wandering around."""

The pilot project for India's experiment with integrated medical care (to combine all systems of medicine) is happening right there in Hoskote taluk 25km from Bengaluru.There are four clinics, all next to one another allopathy, natur opathy , ayurveda and homoeopa thy. And this is how it works: Once a patient walks in com plaining of an illness, heshe is subjected to a holistic evaluation. The patient's history data sheet is readied before the system of medicine for treatment is chosen. For instance, if the person is diabetic, then the allopathy doctor does the blood sugar test and the ayurveda doctor counsels on diet because it re quires lifestyle modifications.If it's regular cough and cold the treatment is homoeopathy Likewise, if the patient walks in with muscle pain and shows symptoms of arthritis, then the course of treatment is a combination of ayurveda (oil treatment) and naturopathy (yoga for easing muscle tension).The collaborative project of the Ayush ministry and Royal College of Medicine (London) is being implemented by international holistic healer Dr Issac Mathai under a public-private partnership model. WHO studies project: Last week, a team from the World Health Organisation (WHO) visited Hoskote to study the project.""The idea is to see how we can integrate traditional systems of medicine with the western system (allopathy). With chronic diseases more prevalent in India, traditional systems of medicine must assist allopathy in finding a cure. For instance, if a patient walks in with blood pressure (BP) of 150, we won't tell him to meditate... we'll go for allopathy instead, because it comes under emergency care. In case of many other ailments, it could be a combination of treatment; the key is to co-exist. We have collaborated with the Karnataka gover nment whose clinic is right opposite ours,"" Dr Mathai told TOI.In all, the project has over 14,000 patient records from 5,900 households in seven villages. There are four consultation rooms for each system of medicine, a yoga room, a common lab for tests and a drug store. The store has three cupboards packed with ayurveda, homoeopathy and allopathy medicines.Doctors Ramya K (homoeopathy), Dr Kavya Kamath and Dr Satish R (ayurveda) and Dr Prakash (naturopathy) are the perfect examples of co-existence at the project site. ""We started off with mobile clinics and did that for nearly four years before setting up these ones. We'd go door to door, explaining the integrated system to villagers,"" explained Dr Satish.Not surprisingly, Harvard is using the Hoskote experiment as a case study for its medical students.The biggest ambassadors for propagating the integrated or holistic healthcare are the village women who do the job of spreading the good word. ""We talk to people about the importance of not ignoring any pain or discomfort. We ensure the health kit is used and herbs in the garden are consumed,"" said Ratnamma, who has benefited from integrated medicines for her goitre.As Anupama and her coworkers put it: ""We must move away from antibiotics and injection approach for all ailments and embrace natural systems of healing."""

58f11775a3d24b245e595c68,"UP highest producer of ethanol, beats Maharashtra",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/UP-highest-producer-of-ethanol-beats-Maharashtra/articleshow/50460418.cms,2016-01-06,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh is here to 'drive' the country, quite literally. India's most populous state has pipped Maharashtra to become India's largest producer of ethanol for blending with petrol.According to a recent data of Union petroleum ministry, in 2015, UP produced 56 crore litres of ethanol against Maharashtra's 52 crores litres. The two states together accounted for nearly 67% of country's total ethanol production of around 161 crore litres a year. They are followed by Karanataka (25 cr litres), Andhra (8.5 cr litre), Gujarat (8 cr litres) and Tamil Nadu (7.6 cr litres).The surge in ethanol production in the state was driven largely by UP's sugar industry. Data shows distilleries in sugar mills, like the one in Saharanpur and Basti, contributed maximum by producing around 4 crore litres each. Likewise, the Muzaffarnagar sugar mill and Mawana sugar mill produced 3.6 crore litre and 2.8 crore litres, respectively.UP has 61 distilleries, out of which 36 are attached to sugar mills. Not surprisingly, all 36 mills chipped in for ethanol production.Of the total 56 crore litres of ethanol production, UP is expected to use 30 crore litre for its own consumption, leaving rest to be exported to Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Industry sources said an increase in ethanol production was largely a fallout of a sharp plunge in prices of raw sugar last year.Industry sources said millers gradually started diverting cane juice for production of the 'clean fuel' that fetched them relatively higher profit. Petroleum companies, which lift ethanol from distilleries, paid them at the rate of Rs 48.5 per litre . This was sufficiently higher than prices of sugar which kept falling following a glut.This got another boost earlier this year when Centre decided to waive off excise duty on ethanol for the financial year 2015-16. An excise duty of 14% is charged on per litre of ethanol.The industry, however, has been complaining of procedural difficulties and delays in obtaining permits/no-objection certificate from the excise department. ""This delays the movement of ethanol, which in turn results in depriving the state exchequer of its legitimate revenue,"" said a miller.When contacted, UP cane commissioner Ajay Kumar Singh said there has been a demand for more administrative convenience by the industry. ""The state government is looking into it,'' he said, while speaking to TOI. Singh said the ethanol was certainly a big sector that needs to be looked into.Centre in August had decided to boost ethanol production by making 10% blending with petrol mandatory in its efforts to resolve the sugar imbroglio.

The more Mathad and his comrades struck work, disrupted schools and railway lines asking the British to quit India, the more the empire struck back with raids and arrests. That is when daring escapades in a sari and guerrilla activism become the norm for him. After Independence, he worked to promote village industries. Mathad, now 93, is president of All-India Freedom Fighters' Samithi.I was 19 and Belgaum was the hotbed of the Quit India movement in the 1940s... I was arrested for taking out a 'prabhat pheri' (morning procession) in 1942 but nearly 100 people came to release me at Kavadiguda railway station. In that confusion, I ran out and went to the station master's house, asked his wife for a sari, wore that red garment and got away. The next day we took shelter in the nearby Godchinamalaki hills. We joined another group of free dom fighters, continued to disrupt office s a n d schools, while sleeping on jowar fields or by the river. We were finally caught in 1943.Gandhiji's associate Gajanan Naik told me and others Gandhians with organisational skills to join the government. I was asked to help improve village industries. They wanted me to be in Bangalore. I told them that if they wanted to develop palm jaggery and sugar factory in villages then the head office should be in a village. But after the department came under Khadi Board in 1957, it came under governmental control. People started working just for salaries and khadi lost out.Many of them are dead.Around two years ago, I became the all-India president of the samithi, which has around 3,000 members. There are hardly 10 people like me in Karnataka who get central pension. There are around 9,000 recipients of state pension. But in this category there are bogus claims. When the state government allotted housing plots to freedom fighters in Bangalore, they gave it to all those who were getting pension and didn't insist on documentary proof. Now, freedom fighters are pension fighters."

While no other member in his family is part of Sunday's event, they will certainly cheer for him when he crosses the finish line.""Apart from a sugar problem, I don't suffer from any ailment. Regular walking and jogging keeps me in good shape,"" he said.As a senior superintendent at Durgapur Steel Plant in West Bengal, Das, a sports enthusiast, dabbled in football and badminton.

My family, especially my wife Ritka, has been supportive of my mission,"" he said.One of the reasons he is able to run at this age is the strict diet regime that he follows. Sangita, his daughter, said he ate within limits and his diet included dry fruits, typical Bengali meals of rice, lentils, vegetables, fish and curd and an occasional dry snack.""I make sure I get proper sleep. I sleep reasonably early since I wake at 5.40am. Then from 6.15am to 9.15am, I jog on the streets,"" he laughed and said.Keeping his body in good shape is not his only mission.

Though many prominent schools in the city started health food awareness among students even before the board directive, they will now strictly implement the guidelines.Welcoming the board's decision, the CBSE schools in Bokaro are taking steps to ensure that vendors outside the premises too do not sell unhealthy food. The circular lays down that no HFSS food must be available in school canteens and, if possible, necessary steps must be taken to ensure non-availability of HFSS within 200-metre radius of the campus.Ashok Singh, principal of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, said they have already circulated the food chart among students ""with the slogan 'Eat healthy, Keep fit'"".""We encourage students to eat healthy food like roti-sabji, idli, dhokla, sprouts, salad. We are asking our teachers to share food with their students so that we know whether the guidelines are followed. If we catch someone with junk food on campus, we will call his parents and counsel them,"" said Singh.HFSS food can lead to diseases like diabetes, hypertension, chronic inflammation at an early age. On Saturday, Singh visited the shops in the vicinity of the school and requested them to stop selling unhealthy food to students.Other schools, besides Chinmaya, have also asked students not to bring chips, fried food, aerated drinks, ready-to-eat noodles, pizzas, burgers, potato fries, etc. Father Jacob Thomas, principal of MGM Higher Secondary School, said the canteen has been alerted about the new rule and a food chart will be put up inside the canteen in the next few days.Suresh Kumar, general secretary of Sardar Patel School, said, ""We have asked children to bring roti-paratha and vegetables for lunch. The students staying in hostel at Kamlapur are served rice-dal, roti and sabji.""A few schools, like Pentecostal Assembly School, which do not have canteens encourage students to bring healthy food from home.But the health drive has not impressed many students. Sunita Kumari, a student of a public school, said though eating healthy food is good, banning junk food is not right. ""Sometimes we can eat junk food for a change of taste. My parents are already strict about what I eat and now the school's instructions have given them more reasons to get stricter,"" she said.Parents have welcomed the move, but some pointed out that preparing paratha and vegetables would be time-consuming, especially for working mothers.

It gets better. Its lush forests are home to more big cats than 406, the number thrown up by the national tiger census report in 2014.The census report released by the Wildlife Institute of India omitted protected areas like Male Mahadeshwara (MM Hills) Wildlife Sanctuary and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary , traditionally not known for tigers. Now, a scientific analysis of 1,933 sqkm done through camera-trapping has found a healthy tiger population in the two protected areas. While at MM Hills, 12 tigers were discovered, two were documented at Cauvery .""These areas have the potential to double their tiger count within five years, as a lot of them are young,"" said wildlife biologist Sanjay Gubbi, key author of the study conducted by Nature Conservation Foundation.The findings clearly indicate that the two protected areas, located in the confluence of the Eastern and Western Ghats, have scope for adequate funding and more protection under the Project Tiger initiative.Asked if the government would push for declaring the region as another tiger reserve, minister for cooperation and sugar HS Mahadeva Prasad, who released the report, said the matter will be looked into. Prasad, who is also minister in charge of Chamarajanagar district, under which most of the region falls, said: ""With the report in hand, we will review the proposal to declare the region as a new tiger reserve. If the declaration doesn't pose a threat to local communities, we have no problem. However, a final decision has to be taken by the department concerned, in consultation with the Centre"".Gubbi said the region needs more protection so that dispersing tigers find suitable habitats. ""The camera-trapping exercise was very encouraging. Apart from the tigers, even cubs were photographed. The Greater BRT tiger landscape (BRT-MM Hills-Cauvery-Bannerghatta-Sathyamangalam-North Cauvery) has the potential to accommodate 150 tigers, if measures are taken,"" he added.A camera-trapped tiger from MM Hills was found to be roaming in an area extending up to 360 sqkm (half the BBMP area) across the two sanctuaries. This is said to the largest range recorded so far in the country.The study also found two tigers with two common habitats -BRT and MM Hills. This highlights the importance of protecting the Doddasampige-Yediyaralli corridor, which is the last forest patch connecting BRT and MM Hills, said experts."

The Kolhapur District Central Cooperative (KDCC) Bank, which has taken charge of the factory, had decided to lease it out to Kumuda Sugars to protect the interests of local sugarcane growers.Avinash Bhosale, chairman of Kumuda Sugars confirmed that he is withdrawing from the agreement of running the Daulat Cooperative Sugar Factory at Halkarni in Chandgad.The decision has come as a major setback for the KDCC Bank. Kumuda Sugars had last week submitted deposits worth Rs 1 crore with the KDCC for signing the deal. The KDCC had handed over the factory to Kumuda Sugars for 29 years' lease for which latter had agreed to pay Rs 10 crore by January end.Kumuda Sugars was operating the Aryan Sugars in Solapur on lease. For non-payment of fair and remunerative prices to the farmers, the state cooperation department has initiated the process of legal action against the company. This has irked the company and made it withdraw from Daulat's bidding, sources said.As per the reports released by the KDCC, the Daulat sugar factory has cumulative dues of Rs 350 crore. Out of this, Rs 65 crore is basic loan amount.Sources close to the development said, ""It is nothing but politics that is happening behind the curtains. Local leaders like Narsingh Gurunath Patil, who was controlling Daulat is against leasing out the factory. If the factory goes to Kumuda Sugars, Patil will lose chances of making a comeback in local politics because sugar factory is a major tool to influence a tehsil's politics.""When contacted, Patil said, ""I have been requesting the KDCC to share the financial burden on the factory, so that I can raise some funds and restart the factory. In the following years, I will repay the amount in instalments. The board of directors is not interested in handing over the factory to me, merely due to politics."""

It is hoped the tax would discourage staff, patients and visitors from buying sugary items.The move will make the NHS the first public body in the UK to bring in a sugar tax, and it will use the expected proceeds, between 20 million pounds and 40 million pounds a year, to improve the health of its own 1.3 million workers.NHS bosses will begin consulting on introducing the tax, which would be gradually enforced as catering and hospital shop contracts come up for renewal over the next three to five years. ""We will be con sulting on introducing an NHS sugar tax on various beverages and other sugar-added foods across the NHS, which would be enforced over time as contracts for food catering and the shops that are in the foyers of hospitals come up for renewal over the next three to five years over a rolling basis,"" Stevens said.""By 2020, we've either got these practices out of hospitals or we've got the equipment of a sugar tax on the back of them,"" he said.The NHS levy will be linked to the UK's upcoming national childhood obesity strategy .

It is also a day for assigning all your vices or sins to fire or sun, he says. Explaining the significance of giving a daan or flying kites on the occasion, Vekhande says, ""The birds too change their course and fly in the direction of sun. Kite flying is a symbol of this activity and that is why on Sankranti across the country people fly kites facing the sun. Making donations also is a means of reducing one's sins. So daan is part of rituals and so is a bath that means washing away your sins.""Black saris, Halwa daginey, which are intricate pieces of jewellery made with sugar, loot for small children all form part of Sankranti rituals.

Halwa daginey is made to welcome the new entrants to the family, be it a bride, son-in-law or a new born baby.

It found that of the 3,486 pregnant women admitted to the hospital, 250 were above 35 and classified as ""high risk"" in maternal medicine. The researchers compared the progress of these patients with another 250 women aged between 20 and 34 against parameters like duration of infertility, recurrent miscarriages and antenatal complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases.Though there are several studies from developed countries linking higher incidence of obstetric complications to age, research in the country is nascent despite women increasingly delaying pregnancy , said Dr Subha Sivagami Sengodan , from the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Government Thoothukudi Medical College and Hospital, who led the study . Hospitals have also been quick to capitalise on this trend by offering fertility treatments and ""100% high-risk pregnancy care"".Experts estimate that at least 60% of urban women now conceive for the first time between 30 and 35 years. Gynaecologist Dr Geetha Haripriya said the most common reason for them to delay pregnancy is career. ""Fertility declines with advancing age but now women in their early to mid 30s are also facing complications due to fertility issues and other medical conditions related to lifestyle. And at least 80% of them require fertility treatment just to be able to conceive, which is the first big challenge,"" she said.Besides high risk of miscarriage, the study found that gestational diabetes and hypertension, both chronic and pregnancy induced, are more after the age of 35 compared to the younger group. ""Some of them also had a history of diabetes and systemic hypertension owing to high BMI and obesity ,"" said Dr Sivagami. The incidence of spontaneous abortion was also high because of high blood pressure and aging of uterine blood vessels.It isn't just the mother who faces high risks: Preterm delivery was higher in the older group (37.4% versus 25.3% in the younger one), with many of them being required to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for preterm care and monitoring of sugar levels.Gynaecologists, however, maintain that most of these conditions are manageable if the women were screened early and periodically . ""When a woman chooses to get pregnant is her decision, but they need to start planning early,"" said gynaecologist and fertility expert Dr Priya Selvaraj.While freezing eggs is an option, many go in for natural conception or opt for other assisted reproductive technology, she said, recommending preconception, genetic counselling and increase folic acid intake for four to six months in advance."

The price of sugar was between Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg in the retail market last year and has been steadily increasing for the past few months.According to sources, the price of sugar is skyrocketing due to fall in production which in turn is due to the closure of sugar units like Deccan Sugars Limited last year and cane farmers switching to other crops due to non-payment of arrears to them by the factory managements. Besides, the expected rise in demand has led to some traders illegally hoarding stocks and creating an artificial shortage at the commencement of the festival season.""Sugar production has come down from 3.2 lakh metric tonnes last year to 2.5 lakh metric tonnes this year. This because the sugarcane cultivation area has come down to 32,000 hectares from 45,000 hectares during the previous years. In this kharif, sugar plantation so far is just 19,000 hectares in Telangana,"" sugar commissioner Bhadru Maloth told TOI on Tuesday. Interestingly, there was about 1.2 lakh metric tonnes surplus sugar supplies last year. In view of this, the Telangana government considered imposing entry tax on sugar imports from neighbouring states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as these states were dumping the sugar stocks here as they too faced a surplus.Officials recall that farmers were given Rs 2,600 per tonne including the Fair and Renumerative Price (FRP) of Rs 2,300 per quintal last year announced by the Centre.

""The crop area has not only come down in Telangana, but also in other states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka due to continuous drought,"" Maloth said.Farmers blame the state government for this current crisis and rise in sugar prices. There had been uncertainty over the fate of Nizam Deccan Sugars Limited (NDSL) for the past few years. The state government had appointed a committee that is still to come out with any concrete decisions. Three units of NDSL located at Bodhan in Nizamabad, Metpally in Karimnagar and Mombojipally in Medak district had stopped the sugarcane crushing and the units were closed last year.""Of about 40,000 farmers, who cultivate sugarcane and supply the produce to NDSL, 12,000 farmers switched to other crops while another 5,000 to 6,000 moved to other crops due to drought,"" industries department officials said."

Though foot injuries are most common, even injuries to the back and shoulders cannot be ruled out.Dr Rajesh Badiyani, orthopaedic surgeon, said joint problem among runners are most common in joints that bear weights, such as the hips, knee and ankles.""If someone suffers an injury, then that person should opt for a compression bandage or splints to stabilize the affected area. An elevation of the limbs to reduce swelling also helps,"" he said.He added that an appropriate intake of vitamin D, calcium and iron is important to maintain the strength of the bones. ""In an adverse condition, it is ideal to rest and ferment the area with ice. If the injury is severe, then the runner should slowly return to activity after several weeks of healing and stretching exercises,"" he said.Kanchan Patwardhan, clinical nutritionist, said that stocking up on carbs is ideal since they convert into glycogen and our body uses glycogen while running. ""Ideally, the carbs should come from wholegrain cereals, dry fruits, potatoes and sweet potatoes and beet roots. Muscles tend to weaken over time and proteins together with carbs help repair and rebuild muscles,"" she said.To avoid cramps, she suggested vitamin E and B and eating a sizeable quantity of antioxidants. ""This helps not just in boosting one's immunity but in fighting free radicals as well,"" Kanchan added.Both agree that staying hydrated is the key to complete the distance without any worry. They advise runners to drink adequate liquids to balance electrolyte levels. One should avoid adding excessive sugar to these drinks. ""Just drink enough water to stay well hydrated,"" Kanchan said."

The study by Dr John was commissioned by the Bihar government.Earlier, US-based Centre for Disease Control (CDC) had said that Jamaican Ackee - a fruit resembling litchi - is known to have a toxin that causes AES-type disease in African nations.Even though Dr John is yet to submit his report to the Bihar government, the findings have been published in the recent edition of Current Science, a journal of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The paper is jointly authored by Dr John and Arun Shah of Indian Institute of Toxicology Research-Lucknow.Responding to TOI's emailed queries, Dr John said, ""The CDC research of 2013 said litchi seeds contain a toxin that causes hypoglycaemia; that is, fall in sugar level. However, children seldom swallow seeds. They swallow litchi fruits, hence it (the cause) remained a mystery. Our research confirmed both ripe and semi-ripe litchis contain a toxin called methylene cyclopropyl-glycine (MCPG) that causes hypoglycaemia in children, which leads to death.""The paper contains a table which shows the highest amount of MCPG is found in litchi seeds, followed by semi-ripe and ripe litchi fruits. The paper also clarifies AES is not encephalitis, but encephalopathy. In encephalitis, brain is primarily affected due to viral infection. In encephalopathy, brain is ""secondarily affected"" and not by a virus. Dr John has termed the disease as 'hypoglycaemic encephalopathy'.However, AES is also killing children in Gorakhpur (UP) and Malda (West Bengal), where they are not exposed to litchis. To this, Dr John replied his research is based only on Muzaffarpur kids. ""The AES of Gorakhpur remains to be diagnosed. There is no litchi connection in Gorakhpur. In Malda, however, there are litchi orchards, and what is called AES there could be 'hypoglycaemic encephalopathy',"" he said.According to the State Health Society of Bihar, the number of AES cases in 2015 was 390 compared to 1,028 in 2014. In this regard, Dr John said, ""In 2015, the litchi yield was apparently low. Besides, the health department spread awareness that children shouldn't go to sleep without meal as this could lead to hypoglycaemia. Supervision by adults on litchi consumption is another factor.""Muzaffarpur-based Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital's paediatrics HoD Dr Braj Mohan agrees with Dr John's research, but with a caveat. Dr Mohan, who has years of experience of treating AES-affected kids and who was earlier critical of the litchi theory, said, ""I would add that the kids who have a compromised liver and/or are malnourished are more susceptible to the litchi toxin.""AIIMS-Patna director G K Singh said his institute's findings also showed 64 AES-hit patients suffered from hypoglycaemia. ""But whether hypoglycaemia was the cause or the effect of AES is yet to be established,"" he told TOI, adding 60% AES-hit patients in Muzaffarpur did not have any exposure to litchi. Dr Singh stuck to his institute's theory that it is a water-borne disease and children are being infected by a virus carried through the Saryu in UP and Bihar. The Saryu's contaminated matter reaches the Ganga in Chhapra and then to the Gandak, which crosses Muzaffarpur. ""Better sanitation for prevention of transmission of virus through faeco-oral route is the key (to AES control). Based on this hypothesis, measures taken by the state government to provide safe drinking water led to fall in the number of AES cases in 2015,"" Dr Singh told TOI."

The sector which was reeling under the impact of sliding prices and bulging stocks is being slowly nursed back to health with steps taken by the government bearing fruit for farmers and millers. The revival in prices has also helped.Millers were bleeding due to crashing sugar prices and increasing cane arrears of farmers last April. But with prices improving - almost coming close to the production cost - and the industry aggressively offloading excess stock due to government measures, a crisis seems to have been averted. Cane arrears for 2014-15 sugar season has declined to only Rs 2,712 crore from Rs 21,000 crore in April.According to the apex body of sugar millers, ISMA, the all India average ex-mill price this year is Rs 29.50 per kg against last year's price of Rs 24.92. The production cost has remained around Rs 31. ""The increase in ex-mill prices has happened in the past three-four months. The difference between production cost and ex-mill price is somewhere close than what was prevalent in July 2014. This is a very positive sentiment and we expect the same to continue during 2016-17 sugar season. If this continues for three-four years the industry will revive in a big way,"" said ISMA secretary general Avinash Verma.Sources in the food ministry said that the main reason behind the ex-mill price increasing is the estimated reduction in production of the sweetener both in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to adverse weather conditions. They said after a long time the likely production and domestic consumption will match. ""We expect the total production and consumption to be to be around 260 lakh tonne. The main reason behind the crisis has been the excess production. For example, the total production last year was 283 tonne against total consumption of 255 tonne,"" one of the officials said.Industry sources said that another year of bumper production of sugarcane looks unlikely which will push the market sentiment and improve prices further. ""But there is no question of country facing any shortage of sugar as we still have huge stocks. The opening balance this year was about 91 lakh tonne,"" Verma said.Officials said the private players have also stepped up their exports since government set the minimum indicative quota target for the industry to ship out 40 lakh tonne. They added the food ministry in its order has specified that non-compliance of this will be treated as a violation of government order.ISMA sources said that last year only 11.06 lakh tonne was exported by the industry and 5 lakh tonne of this was exported under the incentive provided to ship out raw sugar. But only in the past three months 5.76 lakh tonne has been exported and as per estimates this is likely to cross 25 lakh tonne during this year.""Government has taken several steps including the incentives for export of sugar well in advance before the crushing started,"" industry sources said. Some of these measures include extending financial assistance in the form of soft loan, fixed remunerative price for and waived off excise duty on ethanol supplied under Ethanol Blending Program (EBP) and the recent decision of providing production subsidy to sugar mills to offset cost of cane and facilitate timely payment of cane price dues."

The company has also increased its R&D spend by 40% over last five years to catch up with its chief Indra Nooyi's diktat of focusing on better-and-good-for-you products. D Shivakumar, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo India, has been at the helm of the Indian arm of the US food and beverage major for two years. Here, he talks to TOI about the company's game plan for 2016.You know the health and wellness journey that PepsiCo is on. Indra Nooyi's vision for the company has classified products into categories such as good for you, better for you and fun for you. Tropicana, a top-end health and wellness brand, will be an extremely important part of our portfolio going forward. We locally source nearly 65% of what we sell here in terms of fruit juices. Therefore, it's a very important element of the value chain of the agriculture market. Fruits and vegetables are an important part of the agenda for the government going forward. And Tropicana will play an important role in executing that.We have just launched mosambi juice, which is a great innovation. This is the first branded mosambi juice in the market. The most widely-consumed drink in India is mosambi with 18% market share followed by lime juice (nimbu paani). We are competing with a housewife who prepares mosambi juice and a vendor selling it on the street. The focus on Tropicana is to build a whole range of these type of drinks, to really get fruit juice to be a part of the diet of an Indian family. Earlier, we didn't have enough citrus processing facilities in India. We have now established that with a partner in Maharashtra. The focus is to Indianize as many products as possible such as orange juice. Later, an extension programme should be a part of our larger programme like we have done with potato.We are testing a product called Revive in Tamil Nadu with low sugar levels. We have reduced a lot of fat content in products such as Lays. In line with PepsiCo's global direction, India will produce a range of healthier products as we go forward. For our snacks and beverage portfolio, we have a clear five-year plan. At the same time, most categories have become premiumised. So, how do you premiumise the range? We launched Lays Maxx last year at a premium. Nimbooz Masala Soda at a premium. I think localisation and premiumisation are going hand in hand in food and drinks. We launched Kurkure Butter Masti, Slice Alphonso. Indians are definitely wanting higher quality products. There is always a value point in the market but this trend is definitely being seen in almost every category.They want healthy with taste. The average Indian family is about four people now. Earlier, it was 5.5. So, if you have two kids in the family, their palates tend to decide what comes into the house. So that's the reason Indian households tend to go for a combination of tasty and healthy and not healthy alone. Even in oats, our masala variants are driving the category.We only have a product approval process in India. Worldwide they have an ingredient approval process. The FSSAI is working with the industry to find out the best way to go about it. So the industry is united about having an ingredient approval process as opposed to product approval. Ashish Bahuguna has been receptive to our suggestions and I am sure he will do the best thing possible."

As they left the upmarket Tarantella restaurant and strolled together to a casino, Kovtun told his friend that he wanted to track down a mutual acquaintance, an Albanian chef, to ask him to put some ""very expensive"" poison into Litvinenko's food or drink, according to D3's later account to police. ""Litvinenko was a traitor, there is blood on his hands,"" Kovtun allegedly told him.Two days later, Kovtun flew to London to join Andrei Lugovoi. They met Litvinenko in the Pine Bar at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair, London. Having failed to secure the services of the Albanian chef, the pair put the polonium 210 in the white porcelain teapot and left it for the teetotal Litvinenko to drink, the chairman of the inquiry concluded.""I didn't like it for some reason - well, almost cold tea with no sugar - and I didn't drink it any more,"" Litvinenko told police from his hospital bed. ""Maybe in total I swallowed three or four times, I haven't even finished that cup.""Kovtun - who later suffered radiation poisoning himself - intimated that he was the tool of higher powers during an apparently unguarded comment to his mother-in-law.She told police that Kovtun believed he was exposed to the poison which killed Litvinenko. ""He said word for word: 'Those arseholes have probably poisoned us all',"" she later told investigators.Their potential ignorance of the potency of their choice of murder weapon, polonium 210, may have stemmed from complacency caused by a failed first attempt at killing Litvinenko some two weeks before. Their naivety was also suggested by Lugovoi's invitation to Litvinenko - having just drunk the radioactive substance - to shake the hand of his eight-year-old son, who had turned up at the end of their meeting.Why Litvinenko was a targetAs both a former agent of a hated state security apparatus and then an arch Kremlin critic, Alexander Litvinenko had collected an impressive number of enemies. In his report, Sir Robert Owen cited five broad themes as to why he would have given the Russian state a reason to murder him.In 1998, at a press conference in Moscow, he went public with his belief that his employer, the FSB, was a den of corruption. His masters - including the new boss Vladimir Putin - would have considered it an act of betrayal, particularly his claim that he had been ordered to kill a Putin kingmaker turned Kremlin critic, Boris Berezovsky.Moscow believed that he was working for British intelligence after Litvinenko's flight to Britain in 2000, where he kept company with fellow enemies of the Russian state, including Berezovsky and Akhmed Zakayev, the exiled Chechen leader.When he first came to Britain, he was a kept man with the oligarch Berezovsky bankrolling his life, but those funds were being reduced. He was supplementing his income looking into prominent Russians and had embarked on a tentative plan to blackmail Russian ""bastards"" with links to the Kremlin, the inquiry was told.Why Putin is in the frameSir Robert's belief that Vladimir Putin ""probably"" approved the killing stems from personal animosity between the pair and attempts by Litvinenko to expose his former boss's links to alleged criminality. Their only face-to-face meeting was in 1998, soon after Putin became head of the FSB, when Litvinenko sought his help to expose criminality with the organisation.While working in a unit that tackled serious organised crime, Litvinenko became convinced of links between a St Petersburg-based criminal group and officials including Putin. Litvinenko's first impressions were not favourable, he recounted in a book. ""I immediately had the impression that he is not sincere,"" he wrote of Putin. ""He looked not like an FSB director, but a person who played the director.""A few months later, Litvinenko went public on his claims, which the Russia expert Professor Robert Service said was probably seen by Putin as ""the first of a series of occasions on which Litvinenko was guilty of breaching the FSB code of loyalty"".As a result, Litvinenko was sacked, investigated and jailed, before fleeing with his family to Britain in 2000. From London, and under the protective wing of Berezovsky, he became the most ""prominent and ebullient"" of critics of the Putin regime. He accused the FSB of co-ordinating a series of apartment bombings, blamed on Chechen separatists, which gave the Kremlin the justification to start a war. Putin was then the Prime Minister.Litvinenko reached a ""climax of attacks"" when he described Putin as a paedophile in an article in 2006. Litvinenko claimed that on becoming FSB chief Putin had hunted for any evidence held by the security service of his liking for children, and found video tapes in the FSB vaults which showed him having sex with boys.Only days before his death, Litvinenko accused Putin, now the President, of responsibility for the murder of the investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya.The inquiry heard that as part of his work for private investigation companies in the UK, he drew up a dossier which claimed that a corrupt FSB man was a protege of Putin. He went on to implicate Putin directly in organised crime, and suggested that he had been involved in helping a Colombian drugs cartel to launder money. That explosive report was passed to a fellow Russian and friend working in the same industry - Andrei Lugovoi - who was later named as his killer and may have passed the document back to the Kremlin.There is no smoking gun contained within the 328-page report that links Putin directly to the ordering of the killing. But the conclusions of the report are based in part on intelligence reports and witness statements that cannot be released because of national security issues.The stymied investigationThe extensive inquiry into the murder of Litvinenko was completed despite the ""stupid, petty obstructions"" put in the way of British police officers who went to Moscow to interview the two main suspects, according to lawyers for the police.Two Scotland Yard officers, who had travelled to Russia to interview Kovtun and Lugovoi, gave evidence to the inquiry. They complained that when they were being taken to one interview, the Russian car they were following drove so fast and erratically that they thought it was deliberately trying to lose them.They had to provide questions in advance, were not allowed to make their own recordings in the interviews, and when these did take place they were so rushed that they barely had the opportunity to ask any questions, they said.When tapes of the interview handed over by the Russians were examined back in London, they discovered that there was not one of the Lugovoi interview. The report also found that the inquiry team was frustrated in attempts to test two commercial aircraft for radioactivity after they had been used by the suspected killers.Police believe their requests were deliberately frustrated by the Russian authorities. They never had the opportunity to test the aeroplane used by Kovtun and Lugovoi for the first attempt at poisoning some two weeks before the fatal attack.The Russian refusal to extradite the pair was not considered as part of an attempted cover-up. They never extradite anyone - and given Britain's unwillingness to send back Boris Berezovsky to Russia it was always unlikely.What we learnt: Other findingsA startling example of the extent that Litvinenko had become an enemy of the state was highlighted by video evidence of Russian soldiers using targets featuring his face. Police believe his image was plastered on targets at a special forces training centre, where Litvinenko had been a member before joining the FSB. His widow told the inquiry that it had been going on before his death.The murder weapon - polonium 210 - would have cost tens of millions of pounds, the inquiry was told. Experts pointed to the likely source being a closed nuclear facility, 450 miles from Moscow, both suggesting the likelihood of state involvement. Sir Robert said he could not conclude it was manufactured in Russia.Andrei Lugovoi sent a T-shirt to Boris Berezovsky with the message ""CSKA Moscow Nuclear Death is Knocking Your Door"" in what the inquiry found was a ""gleeful acknowledgement"" of his part in the death.The writing on the front - ""Polonium-210 CSKA London, Hamburg To Be Continued"" - was a clear reference to Litvinenko's murder. Lugovoi had given it to a Russian going to Britain, and asked that it be delivered to the oligarch.""The T-shirt could be seen as an admission by Lugovoi that he had poisoned Litvinenko, made at a time when he was confident that he would never be extradited from Russia, and wished to taunt Berezovsky with that fact,"" said Sir Robert.Sir Robert said that at the very least it demonstrated approval of the killing by Lugovoi, a fan of CSKA Moscow football club. After the killing, Lugovoi went with his family to see his team play Arsenal in London."

He has demanded that the state government come out with the industrial policy as there is no place for agro-based industries in the government's plans.Speaking to reporters here on Sunday, Madhu said that thousands of workers had lost jobs following the closure of jute mills, sugar mills and spinning mills due to inefficiency of the state government. He said the state government had turned a mute spectator to the closure of factories even while thousands of workers rendering jobless. ""Though the CM is visiting the other nations inviting the industrialists there to invest in the state, no one is coming to set up shops. Only the polluting factories banned in the developed countries are finding their way into the state,"" alleged Madhu.He said that the crisis in the textile industry is giving thousands of workers sleepless nights as there is no guarantee as to when these factories are going to be closed down. Instead of protecting the manufacturing and engineering industries to provide more employment, the state government is backing highly polluting industries in the state, he said.Madhu criticised the government for deploying police forces to stamp down people's movements against the polluting industries. He said that people in Tundurru, Pampadipet and Kota mandals in West Godavari district are being tortured with false cases for opposing the chemical factories.The residents of Konda Juturu village are opposing setting up of a chemical plant as they fear it will spread pollution. The CM is singing the Singapore mantra only to suppress mass movements with the help of police as is the practice in the south-east Asian city-state. He, however, made it clear that they would not allow the government to go ahead with its dictatorial policies and stall the pollutant industries at any cost.CPM senior leader Paturu Ramaiah was also present."

Voting will take place on November 19. It could turn out to be a three-cornered fight in Bhandara-Gondia and four-cornered at Yavatmal.The saffron BJP-Sena alliance fielded 'outsiders' in both the seats. Congress and its traditional ally Nationalist Congress Party went separate ways and have put up their respective candidates with a yet another twist. Sitting NCP MLC Sandeep Bajoriya will now contest as an Independent and not as NCP official nominee from Yavatmal. The biggest surprise came in the form of Shiv Sena deputing a leader from Pune, Tanaji Sawant , to contest from Yavatmal as the saffron alliance candidate.Parinay Fuke of the BJP Praful Agrawal of Congress and sitting MLC Rajendra Jain of NCP submitted forms for Bhandara-Gondia local self government bodies constituency. The forms will be scrutinized on November 3 and the last date to withdraw nominations is November 5. Fuke is reportedly close to CM Devendra Fadnavis while Jain is said to be a trusted lieutenant of NCP stalwart Praful Patel. Gondia Congress MLA and senior Congress leader Gopaldas Agarwal's son Praful is Congress nominee.Those who filed nomination papers at Yavatmal are: Shankar Bade of Congress, Osmanabad-based sugar baron Tanaji Sawant of Shiv Sena-BJP alliance, NCP-supported independent Sandeep Bajoria and an independent Mangal Chindaliya from Wani.Sitting MLC Sandeep Bajoria, accompanied by NCP leader Manoharrao Naik and opposition leader in the legislative council Dhananjay Munde, filed papers followed by Chindaliya. Bade was accompanied by party observers Shyam Umalkar and Hukumchand Amdhare, former MPCC president and deputy chairman of legislative council Manikrao Thakre, sitting MP from Hingoli Rajeev Satav , former ministers Shivajirao Moghe, Nitin Raut and Sanjay Deshmukh, DCC president Wamanrao Kasawar. Bade is former president of Pandharkawda Municipal Council.Several leaders including minister of state Sanjay Rathod (Shiv Sena), Madan Yerawar (BJP), sitting MP Bhavana Gawali, sitting MLAs Dr Ashok Uike, Raju Todsam and Rajendra Nagardhane, BJP district unit chief Rajendra Dange, Sena zilla pramukh Vishvas Nandekar and Balasaheb Munginwar etc accompanied Shiv Sena-BJP alliance candidate Tanaji Sawant to the returning officer's chamber.There are total 440 voters in Yavatmal local bodies constituency. Though the candidates and their respective parties are hopeful of victory, there is observable resentment among the workers of both BJP and Sena as they feel an outsider candidate has been imposed on them by the leaders. Sawant is considered close to Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. Similarly, in Bhandara/Gondia, saffron candidate Fuke (of Nagpur) is seen as an outsider though he is being supported by BJP MLA Nana Patole and others.The 393 voters of the constituency include members of zilla parishad, municipal councils, nagar panchayats and sabhapatis of panchayat samitis of Bhandara and Gondia districts. The party wise strength is BJP-119, Congress-102, NCP-123, Shiv Sena-25, Independents-25 and CPI-1 giving a clear edge to Fuke. But one can never tell in such elections with smaller, 'manageable' electorate till the results are out as everything possible is done to influence the voters individually."

The cultivation will be done over one lakh acre of land distributed in 350 nurseries across the state.Sugarcane is traditionally cultivated using stem cuttings of good quality cane. For the past few years, researchers were trying to find out methods of directly cultivating the sugarcane saplings. It was found out that direct cultivation helps in reduction in production expenses and also the crop can be harvested more frequently which will prove beneficial for the cultivators.The deputy project director of ATMA, A D Galitkar said, ""We began this initiative two years ago, however, this is the first time that we found out that the increase of the farmers have increased the sugarcane cultivation using saplings prepared in the nurseries. This method has proven beneficial for the farmers since it reduces the harvesting period and thereby the expenses required for irrigation. In all, a good quality crop can be grown with the help of disease free saplings prepared with utmost care and research.""The direct cultivation method has been discovered to increase output and profitability. The ATMA officials have found that the sugarcane produced through nursery method helps in increasing the recovery rate of the sugar production. In the traditional method, the stem cut are planted in the soil and the quality of the seed used is hardly checked. In the nursery method, the cane plants are raised using small chips taken from the each cane with a single bud and then grown in cups. The 25 to 35 day old seedlings are transplanted in the farms.Galitkar said, ""The farmers are now trained and they can start their own nurseries. The cultivation will begin in the month of November. There are around 350 farmers who have developed the nurseries through the efforts taken out by our technical staff . The cost of cultivation can be cut by 50% if this method is set in operation.""For a hectare cultivation of sugarcane, in the case of traditional method around 80 quintals of cane is needed. While in case of nursery method only two quintals of cane is required. The grading can be done in the new method and there is also a scope for intercropping too."

While 42 were asked to shut down, 218 others have been ordered to install effluent treatment plants to curb pollution, says the internal report.Five other polluting industries have also been partially closed down, says the report. The committee, comprising officials of the pollution control board and the irrigation department of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Baghpat and Gautam Budh Nagar districts - through which the Hindon river flows - was set up in June last year, following UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's order.According to its report, these polluting industries discharged about 70 MLD of effluents into the river everyday. The committee ascertained the level of pollution after taking water samples from at least 10 points along the 300-km stretch of the Hindon over a period of time.Hindon is a rain-fed river that flows through the six UP districts before emptying into the Yamuna. Due to the high level of pollution, the river is said to a 'dead river' and according to the Central Pollution Control Board report, the quality of water in the Hindon is ""unfit"" even for bathing.However, environmentalists are not satisfied with the measures taken by the inter-departmental committee to make Hindon pollution-free, saying it has not taken into account the drainage part and the number of illegal industries operating along the river.

The licenses for the medical shops would be issued/renewed only after such verification.""Proper verification of the pharmacist should be made with regard to his employment/job profession during the previous three years and should verify that he is not employed in any other job/profession,"" said the letter issued by state drugs controller Haryana on December 28, 2015. These steps have been taken by the state government to ensure that the pharmaceutical drugs are not used as intoxicant by the youth of state.Development is also significant, as majority of medical stores in the state ""hires"" pharmacist licenses to run the shop, as the medicines can be sold by or under the supervision of a pharmacist who has the been granted licence by the state pharmacy council.An officer of the state foods and drugs administration said that a large number of license holders who have passed diploma, bachelors or masters degree in pharmacy, got a fixed income of around Rs 5,000-8,000 per month by renting out of their licence to the owners of medical shops and were employed elsewhere.Meanwhile, taking strict action against defaulters under the public distribution system (PDS), Haryana government said it has cancelled licences of 182 depot holders for committing irregularities and the security amount of 456 dealers has been forfeited.Haryana food and supplies minister Karan Dev Kamboj, said police had registered 14 cases and arrested seven persons in this regard till November last year.He said that during this period, security amounting to over Rs 21 lakh has been forfeited, out of which Rs 1.58 lakh was forfeited in November.

Patil said the government will seek reports of factories and initiate action.Patil said on Saturday, ""The rulebook says that one-time payment as per the FRP formula has to be made to the farmer within 14 days from the crushing date of sugarcane from his field. This year, after discussions with sugar factories and farmers' organisations, the state government had spilt the payment in an 80:20 formula.

The factories, which fail to make payment to farmers as per the FRP formula, will have to pay a fine of Rs 5 lakh per day. We will make sure that the factories will adhere to the policy decisions of the state.""The FRP formula is based on the production of sugar from sugarcane.Kolhapur and Sangli districts have higher sugar recovery rate, which is around 12% to 13%.As per the FRP formula, the average payment to the farmers in Kolhapur region is around Rs 3,000 per tonne.At the time of announcing the decision, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had made it clear that the decision is based on the issues such as overproduction of sugar in the state in the past two years and the low demand in the domestic and international markets.To keep the factories running, the state has decided to split the FRP.In August last year, the state had decided to provide financial assistance to farmers so that the factories will not face the heat completely.It was later realised that the Rs 1,982.97 crore financial assistance to the sugar factories in the state is still going to leave a gap of Rs 1,400 crore arrears.The factory managements had then expressed doubts over payment of sugarcane purchase price to farmers. Hence, the state had come up with 80:20 formula for the fair and remunerative price."

Reaching out to the sugarcane growing farmers of Western UP, Modi appealed to the sugar manufacturers to shift to producing more ethanol since global prices of the sweetner had fallen."

Also - and this is the subtext - Pachladi Kritpura and its neighbouring villages are home to the Sainthwar community, an OBC pocket that has traditionally voted for the BJP.

The Modi government is amassing unprecedented amounts of wealth through the taxes they are collecting through increased fuel prices. But none of this additional revenue is being passed along to the poorest in the country. Corporate loans are being written off, but the farmers who need the loan waiver are being ignored. Rahul Gandhi is fighting for these farmers.""To regain its lost ground in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, Rahul's month-long UP Kisan Yatra will meander through various districts of East UP and Bundelkhand before breaking journey in Lucknow, on September 20.

Not only dal, all essential items like rice, sugar and coconut oil are much cheaper at the fair. While Jaya rice is sold at Rs 40/kg outside, the price at the fair is only Rs 26/kg. When the market price for sugar is Rs 43/kg, it is sold for Rs 22/kg at the fair.

Donald, from Thiruvananthapuram, complained that many of the materials are substandard.The Kerala State Handloom Development Corporation alleges that they were marginalized by the organizers of the fair. ""The collection we received this year is less than one third of what we received last year. We were allotted a stall at a place where few people would come. This has affected the sales in a big way,"" said an employee at the stall.The fair was inaugurated by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on August 26. Milma, Kerala State Poultry Development Corporation (KEPCO), Kerala Coir Corporation Ltd etc. have also set up stalls as part of the fair. Artisans from north India have also set up stalls selling handicrafts and handloom products."
58f146aba3d24b245e598244,Boxing: Pros climb into the ring in Rio,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/boxing/Boxing-Pros-climb-into-the-ring-in-Rio/articleshow/53275569.cms,2016-07-19,"Rio de Janeiro, July 19, 2016 (AFP) -Five key elements to know about boxing before the Rio Olympic Games:+ Boxing in Rio will be very different from all the Olympics that have gone before. Most controversially, it will be the first time professional boxers are allowed to take part. But don't expect to see the big names in boxing. In fact, there will likely be only a handful of professionals competing and few will be names most boxing fans have heard of. Critics say that pitting professional pugilists against amateurs could result in serious injury. International Boxing Association (AIBA) president Wu Ching-Kuo -- who pushed for their inclusion -- says that allowing the pros only means boxing is finally doing what almost all other Olympic sports did years ago.+ That is not the only major change to Olympic boxing. Another big difference is that male fighters will no longer wear headguards (they have done so at Olympics since the 1980s). Women fighters will still wear them. Most in the fight game support the ditching of headwear after the AIBA said extensive studies found that there were actually fewer concussions without headguards. Fans of the move also say that for purely aesthetic reasons boxing just looks better. Critics say there are likely to be more cuts as a result -- and with so many fights packed into a fortnight, competitors will have little time for those wounds to heal between bouts. That means we could see plenty of blood.+ And that is not all. The deeply unpopular punch-counting system of scoring -- which has thrown up numerous controversies over the years -- has also been ditched to again bring Olympic boxing closer into line with professional bouts. Now ringside judges will use the ""10-point must system"", with the fighter that wins the round getting 10 points and the other between six and nine. For example, a 10-9 round means that it was close. Boxing -- and Olympic boxing in particular -- has been notorious down the years for some questionable decisions. Don't expect this time to be any different despite the new system.+ Some of the world's finest boxers launched their careers at the Olympics. A certain Cassius Clay -- later to call himself Muhammad Ali -- won gold at the Rome Olympics in 1960. Other notable Olympic boxers who went on to stardom include Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield, Oscar De La Hoya, Lennox Lewis and Floyd Mayweather. The latest is Anthony Joshua, Britain's heavyweight gold medal winner from 2012 who is unbeaten as a pro and ploughing his way through the division. That said, there are plenty of fighters who were brilliant Olympians but flopped as pros -- think the widely ridiculed Audley ""A-Force"" Harrison, Britain's 2000 gold medal winner.+ Olympic boxing will span almost the entire two weeks in Rio and 13 categories -- three weight classes for women and 10 for men. It is just the second time in Olympic history that women will take part. Since its inclusion in the Olympic programme in 1904, boxing has been staged at each edition of the Games, except in 1912 in Stockholm -- because Swedish law did not allow the sport. The United States, Cuba and Britain are the most successful countries.afp"

Nitish alleged that both Yadav and Modi seem to be under the influence of the liquor lobby due to which they were not implementing prohibition.He said that Akhilesh claimed that farmers produce molasses as a byproduct of sugarcane, which in turn is used to make liquor and stopping its production would affect farmers.""In Bihar too, we have sugar mills and our farmers also produce molasses, but even then the state was declared dry. After the ban, we produce ethanol which is more in demand and farmers are getting more income than they used to from molasses,"" Nitish said.Referring to the death of 17 people due to intake of spurious liquor in Etah district, he said, ""What is happening in UP? I want to ask Akhilesh what is going on in UP.""He also targeted Modi for ""not fulfilling his promises"" regarding the Ganga.He claimed that Modi and his second-in-command Amit Shah make organisational changes in the party whenever they conduct a rally in UP.""They made Anupriya Patel minister after our rally and Keshav Prasad Maurya became the head of state BJP after we conducted rally on his turf.

Shivaji Pendkar, President, APMC Market said, ""This initiative has helped create awareness amongst the vendors. Understanding the importance of regular health screening, we will initiate such camps on regular basis to curb growing health concerns."""
58f149d4a3d24b245e5984b2,"Healthy gums, healthy body",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Healthy-gums-healthy-body/articleshow/51478656.cms,2016-03-20,"World Oral Health Day is celebrated every year on March 20. As declared by the FDI World Dental Federation, it is an international day to celebrate the benefits of a healthy mouth, to promote worldwide awareness of issues pertaining to oral health and to highlight the importance of oral hygiene. The theme this year is 'It all starts here. Healthy mouth, healthy body'.Oral health refers to the health of the mouth, which includes the teeth, gums, and supporting tissues. Taking good care of these tissues can prevent disease in them and, in turn, protect one's general health. Good oral healthwhich implies better oral hygieneis crucial to living a comfortable life.Gum disease (periodontal disease) is one of the most prevalent diseases and also the major cause of tooth loss. Statistics show that approximately 95% of the adult population in India suffers from gum disease. The American Dental Association found that advanced gum disease, or periodontitis, is related to diseases of the body, and determined that people with advanced gum disease are 40% more likely to have a chronic health condition.Gum disease is primarily caused by plaque, a colourless, sticky film that builds up on the teeth and contains different types of bacteria. If plaque is allowed to accumulate, it begins to calcify and develops into a hard coating in the form of calculus or tartar. Early symptoms may include gum swelling, bleeding gums, tenderness over the gums and bad breath. At this point, gums may be loose but are still attached high on the teeth. This inflammation of the gums is called gingivitis and is the first stage of gum disease.When gingivitis is left untreated, calculus slowly begins to break down the gum and bone support of the teeth, leading to formation of a 'periodontal pocket' between teeth and gums. It is followed by bone destruction. This advanced stage is called periodontitis. As the disease progresses, more amount of bone gets destroyed, the teeth loosen and eventually fall out, or may need to be extracted.Periodontal disease is often 'silent', meaning symptoms may not appear until an advanced stage. Also, there are associations between it and certain other systemic conditions.Heart disease: Individuals with severe periodontal disease are almost twice as likely to have cardiovascular disease as those with healthy gums. It is believed that bacteria from inflamed gums can enter the bloodstream and stimulate production of certain proteins that can affect the heart by causing blood platelets to stick together, leading to clot formation. Thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) can lead to obstruction of blood flow, resulting in heart attack or stroke. Studies have also established that aggressive treatment of gum disease can reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis.Diabetes: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin, resulting in increased blood sugar level. Gum disease is considered as one of the leading complications of diabetes. The link between diabetes and periodontal disease is a two-way relationship, where diabetes increases incidence and severity of periodontal disease and where severe periodontal disease increases insulin resistance, leading to poorer glycemic control over time. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes are about three times more likely to get periodontal disease than non-diabetics, as the bacteria from the gums thrive on the glucose-rich bloodstream. Smoking increases the risk of periodontal disease tenfold for diabetics. A number of intervention studies have shown that treatment of periodontal disease improves glycemic control.Pregnancy: Research has suggested that women with severe periodontal disease during pregnancy may be at increased risk for having premature or low birth-weight babies. Oral bacteria release toxins, which reach the placenta through the mother's bloodstream and interfere with the growth and development of the foetus. At the same time, the oral infection causes the mother to produce labour-triggering substances too quickly, potentially inducing premature labour and birth. These complications may be reduced through proper oral health care and early treatment of gum disease.Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that gum disease may be linked to many other systemic conditions including respiratory diseases, osteoporosis, kidney diseases, Alzheimer's disease and arthritis.Treatment of periodontal disease depends on how much damage it has caused. Since periodontitis affects more than just the gums, it cannot be controlled only with regular brushing and flossing. The primary goals of periodontal treatment are to promote reattachment of healthy gums, to reduce swelling, depth of pockets, risk of infection, and stop further damage. Treatment of periodontal disease is often extensive and requires a systematic approach by a periodontist (specialist for gum diseases). Prevention is key to maintaining good oral health and avoiding the risk of gum disease and other possible systemic conditions.Scientific studies have proven a molecular level link between gum diseases and systemic conditions. So, a gum infection is one of the many potential risk factors for a number of systemic conditions. Fortunately, it is a modifiable risk factor, which means we can prevent the fatal impact of gum diseases on various systems.(The writer is an assistant professor of the department of periodontics, Goa dental college and hospital, Bambolim, and past president of the Indian dental association, Goa branch)"

The actual work started around 4pm and continued overnight. We tested the strength of the repaired track and then opened it, with instructions to drivers to run the at lower speed as a precautionary measure. Till evening, the track did not face any issue and the movement of trains remained smooth. The accident occurred around 100km from Pune,"" the official said.The officials said the cement sleepers fixed under the track and the clips attached to them and track were damaged. After assessing the damage, the rescue team replaced the clips, sleepers and damaged portion of the track. As a precautionary measure, a team was deployed at the accident spot to observe the movement of trains, an official said.About 40 trains travel every day on this route. There has been a constant demand from passengers to lay another line to reduce delays and increase the strength of the track.

The results emerged after a random blood sugar screening programme was carried out in which 37,075 persons (including 8,259 women) participated between November 15 and January 16 in 34 centres across the city.People in the 41-50 year age bracket were the hardest hit and constituted 26.16% of the diabetic population in the city, followed by 22.97% in the 51-60 year age bracket and 22.78% in the 31-40 year age bracket. Those above 60 years constituted 21.99% of the city's diabetic population.Reacting to the results of the screening, Dr Sanjoy Paul, senior consultant diabetologist, Apollo Sugar, Jubilee Hills, said, ""The findings are on expected lines. The condition of people in the 41-50 year bracket and 51-60 year bracket can be categorised as either 'age-related diabetes' or 'lifestyle-induced diabetes', and can be attributed to various factors like stress, lack of diet control and lack of exercise.""Speaking about the reasons for diabetes among 1,786 diabetic persons in the 31-40 year age bracket, Dr Paul squarely blamed factors like night shifts, late dinners, stress and oily food. ""Close to one-fifth of all adults in the world are diabetic. About 72 million diabetic people live in South-East Asia - out of which 65 million people live in India. This number is expected to grow to 110 million by the 2035 in the absence of effective prevention and management programmes,"" said Gagan Bhalla, CEO, Apollo Sugar.In light of the findings, experts have called for urgent preventive measures. ""Steps to prevent diabetes can be broadly classified into two: Diet management and exercise. The first step requires that people mainly avoid food with a high glycemic index. The second measure, that is physical exercise, can be achieved through a 30-45 minute minute brisk walk, four to five days a week,"" said Dr Mohd Ashraf ul abeddin, consultant physician and diabetologist, Care Hospital, Banjara Hills."

Is your water filter blocked with impurities? All this and more will soon be checked not by experts, but by anyone using an android phone at home.A mobile application has been developed by the Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO), a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratory in Chandigarh.The app will be available on Google Play as a freeware by next month.Known as the 'Insta pH CSIR CSIO', the freeware after detecting the pH value - a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of a liquid - can detect if the curry, milk , drinking water or juice is fresh or not.To test the liquid, a drop is placed on a pH indicator strip.The change in colour gives an indication if the acidic levels of the liquid are normal or not. The user has to take a photo of the strip with his smartphone and allow the app to read the change in colour to predict the pH value.The app has been developed by two PhD students Saurav Kumar and Sankho Turjo Sarkar under the guidance of Amol P Bhondekar, scientist at the Agrionics division of CSIO. Besides detecting adulterated food, the app is also useful for the undergraduate science students who can use it for chemistry experiments like titration.""We will also be including what different pH level indications imply, so that you can check on your mobile if your food is adulterated or not,"" said Saurav. He added, ""There are times when our water filter service people ask us to change the candles which get clogged with impurities.

Experts said warnings could be in the form of labels stating that the product contains excess fat and salt or even a picture of liver indicating that consuming such food may lead to fatty liver.AIIMS, in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research, conducted a study to look at the prevalence of fatty liver in 220 overweight kids aged 10-15 years.

The third, Vilas Bhandarkar, is a close associate of the main accused, NCP legislator Ramesh Kadam, who was the corporation's chairman when the money was siphoned off. They were charged with cheating, forgery, breach of trust, misappropriation of funds, criminal conspiracy.Shah's legal team comprising Amit Desai and Parimal Shroff strongly opposed police custody, stating that there was no case of criminal conspiracy and that it was a pure business transaction.CID said Shah and his employees aided Kadam in siphoning off the money. ""The acccused in collusion have systematically hatched a conspiracy by opening bogus accounts and transferring the money,"" said public prosecutor Praveen Chavan. The issue was over the purchase of an 800 sq m plot at Pedder Road in south Mumbai. In 2014, Kadam, who was then the chairman of the corporation, bought the plot from Hubtown's sister firm, Comran Realty, for Rs 106 crore. The CID said that this money was siphoned off from the corporation and diverted to the bank accounts of Hubtown and Comran Realty. However, the sale agreement of the plot showed an amount of just Rs 40 crore. The police is now investigating where the remaining Rs 66 crore disappeared.Shah made Dhumbre, a civil engineer, and Contractor, a company secretary, directors in Comran Realty. In 2014, he made Kadam additional director of the firm. Kadam was arrested in August 2015.""Kadam registered three cooperative societies and transferred huge amounts into them. We have frozen 18 properties and out of which we have sought permission to attach 12,,"" said SP (CID) Purnima Gaikwad. Kadam is also accused of diverting Rs 30 crore to Maitri Sugar Corporation. Of this, Rs 25 crore went to the account of Hubtown."

TheOld Boys Association () transformed the school ground into a fete whichhas been organizing for decades. Walking in, the ex-students who had once tottered around in the premises decades ago, were immediately transported into a world where they were school students again. Food items which were available with street vendors camped outside school, like,,(hardened sugar chip strung on a thread),etc once again revived the nostalgic aroma.De'SalesSFSSadarSFSOBASFSborkutchuranbhingrikulfiZoeb Vali, a well know city businessman who completed schooling in 1946, found a new energy seeping into him. Speaking on his behalf, his son Shabbir, said, ""He was so excited, he remembered each of teachers and the wonderful time he spent in the school. In fact during his time, the school was at Kamptee and then shifted to the current location, so he got to see both the places. My father usually sleeps around 8.30pm but yesterday he refused to leave for home.""Tejinder Singh Renu, vice-president of OBA, said, ""The planning started hardly two months ago and all OBA members decided to give it a unique flavour, and that's how the fete theme took shape. Almost 2,000 people attended with families and we were happy to take them back in time.""Well known paediatrician, Dr. Girish Subramaniam, said, ""I came back to the school after many years and it was an extremely moving experience. When I saw the younger kids, the recent batches making noise, I realized that boys will be boys, across generations they will have similar traits."" He along with Aspi Bapuna, one of the region's biggest industrialist, and others were felicitated by the OBA.Narinder Kohli, president of OBA and classmate of film director Raju Hirani, said, ""The atmosphere was magical as we have all the batches and almost all retired teachers were present and they enjoyed meeting their students after a long time."" OBA, which pulled off the mega event with perfection is now setting its sights on the biggest milestone yet.

With Ramdev's Patanjali honey and other smaller players entering the segment, the Rs 600-crore category has been witnessing renewed competitive action in recent months.Emami, which sells honey under its Zandu brand, complained last month to the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) against Dabur's print and TV ads that said Dabur Honey met EU standards and has been ranked the No. 1 honey in India in terms of purity and quality by Consumer Voice, a New Delhi-based NGO. Among other things, Dabur was asked to remove the word ""quality"" from a particular section in the ad.In reply, Dabur slammed Emami's recent honey campaigns that said, ""...your honey contains up to 30% added sugar"". Emami has been running a series of campaigns on quality, claiming that other products in the market had sugar in them.A senior executive at Kolkata-based Emami said, ""We had picked up random samples of branded honey including Dabur's from the market and tested them. The tests showed every branded packaged honey in the market contains 20-70% sugar. But since Dabur is the market leader, ASCI said the ad looked like as if we were directly attacking Dabur.""However, a senior executive at Dabur said, ""We got our samples tested from the same lab where Emami tested the samples it picked from the market. Our tests revealed Dabur Honey does not contain added sugar while theirs showed that it does. To solve the confusion, ASCI asked us both to get new tests done together from an independent lab of our choice. But Emami has been asked to modify or stop airing that particular ad by February 16,"" he said.The branded honey market in India has been growing by 15-20% year-on-year, according to industry estimates. While Dabur Honey enjoys a market share of about 60%, the segment has been witnessing entry of players such as Emami that has positioned its Zandu Honey on the quality plank, and Patanjali that has been pitching its honey on competitive pricing. Dabur, on the other hand, has been talking about its purity claim."

The mill is one of the best performing in the state and it has won several top awards at the national level for its efficiency, quality and professionalism.The mill has a capacity of crushing 5,000 tonnes of sugarcane daily.The co-operative sugar mill is known for its progressive approach and ensuring maximum parity in business.Started on Thursday, the app is currently available on android-based operating systems.Samarjitsinh Ghatge, chairman of the mill, said, ""Ours would be probably first co-operative sugar mill in the country to come up with its own app and make maximum data available to our farmers. The information includes weight of the purchased sugarcane, its recovery, price as per the FRP formula, how much sugar has been produced, its timely sale and personal share among others.""The app was launched on the birth anniversary of late Vikramsinh Ghatge, who had founded the sugar mill and successfullyran it for many years. Now, his son Samarjitsinh is looking after the mill.Ghatge said, ""The app is not something we have developed out of nowhere. A decade ago, my father and then chairman of the mill had started a smart card scheme where each sugarcane cultivator was given detailed information about his produce, its recovery and purchase rate. The mobile app is just an extension of his vision.""Mills officials said they would conduct training sessions for farmers on how to access the app and its usage.""The newly founded Shahu Infotech is currently part of the Shahu group, but we would like to run it as a separate company that could develop software and systems for our other businesses such as Kagal Co-operative bank, Shahu milk business, co-operative societies and educational institutes,"" Ghatge said.Sources in the sugar mill sector said such an application in itself is a major achievement. ""Most of the members of the sugar mill are farmers from the rural parts of Kagal tehsil, who generally know only Marathi. In such a situation, training these people about its usage would be a great achievement,"" they said."

But will that end the spate of crippling droughts that India has been struggling with? No, we say. Lack of policies, drought-proofing infrastructure and institutional mechanisms are factors that turn even a minor rainfall deficit into a severe drought. In fact, 33 per cent of India's districts are chronically drought-affected; ironically, most of them receive an annual rainfall of 750-1,100mm,"" states a note written by New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).""Drought in the 1990s was essentially the drought of a poor India. The 2016 drought is of a richer and water-guzzling India. This classless drought makes for a crisis that is more severe and calls for more complex solutions. The severity and intensity of drought is not about lack of rainfall, it is about the lack of planning and foresight, and criminal neglect. Drought is human-made."" CSE's director Sunita Narain warned.Suneel Joshi, state coordinator of Jal Biradari told TOI, ""Though parts of the state have seen good rainfall, most of Marathwada is dry. Even if the parched area receives good rainfall the government and the administration must ensure that every drop of water is conserved. Also, it is important to decide the cropping pattern and curb sugar cane cultivation. There are lessons to learn from this year's drought and if we fail to do so, next year we will face a similar situation.""The study, conducted by advocacy group South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), has observed that Marathwada region cultivated sugar cane, a water-guzzling crop, in face of drought. It claimed that if 50% water being used to cultivate sugar cane in the region was diverted to produce pulses, it would mean livelihood security for over 21 lakh farmers as against 1.1 lakh sugar cane farmers supported as of now.Experts point out that there is no system in place with either the state water resources department, agriculture department or local self-governments to enforce water and crop planning decisions. Existing laws, such as Maharashtra Irrigation Act (1976), Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Act (2005) or Groundwater (Management and Development) Act (2009), that have clear provisions of restricting perennial crops in drought-affected areas, are not being implemented.According to the United Nations (UN), there are seven billion people to feed on the planet today and another two billion are expected by 2050. It's estimated that every person consumes between two and four litres of water per day.Most of the water consumed is embedded in the food people eat. For example, producing one kilogram beef requires 15,000 litres of water, while producing a kilogram wheat requires 1,500 litres.""Drought is not about deficient rainfall, it is about deficient planning. Every year, the government talks of sustainable a plan to tackle drought and all these plans are washed away by the first rains of monsoon. Nobody is really bothered about water until the next drought"" said activist Sampatrao Pawar. He added that the government must involve local governing bodies and other agencies to monitor water usage as well as cropping patterns.As populations increase, especially in dryland areas, more and more people are becoming dependent on fresh water supplies in land that are becoming degraded and aren't sustainable.Water security, like food security, is becoming a major national and regional priority in many areas of the world, the UN study report states."
58f15cbea3d24b245e5992ca,A doce bhaji full of goodness,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/A-doce-bhaji-full-of-goodness/articleshow/53245604.cms,2016-07-17,"Quite literally, the name doce bhaji' is a combination of something sweet and something savoury. Put simply, it is a broken wheat pudding made using ingredients readily available in almost any Goan kitchen - wheat, coconut milk, sugar, clarified butter (ghee) and flavourings. Unlike many traditional sweets which involve a long and tedious making process, this one is relatively kinder on one's time and the strength of arm of the one stirring.While it makes for an ideal tea-time snack, the doce bhaji is considered to be a specialty for lactating mothers and school children due to its strengthening properties. The uninitiated could easily mistake a plate of doce bhaji for a halwa or a sheera, but take a bite of it and the play of textures on your palette will definitely make you want to reach out for one more piece.Elvina Fernandes, 96, recalls her younger days when they would buy whole grains of wheat and then coarse grind them on the dantem (grinding stone) to use in the doce bhaji. These days, with all homes having a mixer/grinder, the process is much easier. ""One needs to be careful not to grind the grains into a complete powder. It has to be coarsely ground. That is the essence of the dish,"" explains Altina Noronha, an Aldona-based home cook who undertakes orders for the sweet, especially during the Christmas season. Further simplifying the process is the easy availability of pre-packed cracked wheat, aka dahlia, in most grocery stores and supermarkets.Describing the making process, Noronha says that it begins with making of the coconut milk. ""The first extract, the thick milk, has to be kept aside. The next two extracts, the thin coconut milk, are used to boil the cracked wheat which has been pre-soaked in hot water for some time. The mix must be stirred gently at regular intervals till the wheat is cooked. Once it is cooked, add the thick coconut milk and then the sugar. Care must be taken that sugar is added only at this stage, for if it is added any earlier, the wheat will remain undercooked, thus giving the doce bhaji an unappealing grainy texture. Then, add the ghee and the flavourings of choice (cardamom or nutmeg, or both) and continue stirring till the mix leaves the sides of the pan. Chopped raisins can be added as a garnish, though not essential. Once it is done, spoon out the mixture into a greased plate and work quickly to smoothen out the top. Allow it to cool and then cut into pieces,"" she says.Commenting on its popularity, Assis Cardozo, proprietor of Mapusa's famous Simonia Stores which specializes in a host of traditional sweets, says that they sell about four to five kilos of doce bhaji on a daily basis. ""Only, it has an extremely short shelf life and has to be consumed quickly or refrigerated. This is also the reason why we advise against holidayers/tourists wanting to take it back with them. If they insist, we caution them to freeze it for atleast two days prior to transportation,"" he says."

He was a member of the governing board of IIM-Lucknow. He was also chairman of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Stock Holding Corporation of India, apart from being on the board of companies like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, General Insurance Corporation of India, Jindal Steel and Tata Chemicals.But unlike these companies, Mallya's ambitious plans for KFA were taking it towards its doom. The fortunes of the airline, which never reported a profitable quarter, nosedived in 2007 when Mallya decided to buy Captain Gopinath's Air Deccan to fly abroad on its licence without waiting for five years as per rules. ""Suddenly, we had a fleet of 100 planes and frankly it was just too much for us to handle,"" said a person, who was among the people running KFA.Deccan founder G R Gopinath was on the combined airlines' board, but was eased out later as KFA subsumed his airline. Then financial losses mounted, flights were slashed and payments to everyone  employees, airports, oil companies, tax authorities and provident fund  stopped. This was the time when KFA saw an exodus of its independent directors.Among the first to sense trouble in KFA and leave the board was Dr Trehan. The eminent heart surgeon had joined in October 2008 and quit in September 2010. This led to an exodus with other distinguished people disassociating themselves from the beleaguered airline. Amritraj quit in March 2012 on the ground that his travel schedule did not allow him to attend KFA board meetings. Within days, another independent director Anil Kumar Ganguly also quit, citing ""indifferent health"".Things came to such a pass that in the end, Mallya found it difficult to meet Sebi's listing norm, which requires that at least half of the board must comprise independent directors. In a desperate attempt to meet the norm, KFA got the consent of three people in March 2012 to be independent directors. They were former Vijaya Bank chief Manmohan Singh Kapur, corporate lawyer Lalit Bhasin and former MD of Kolhapur Sugar Mills Shrikant Ruparel. KFA flew for just six months after this and was grounded in October 2012.As hope of it flying again vanished, all remaining independent directors quit. Exodus after grounding was ignited by Mallya's close aide who started KFA with him  Hitesh Patel  who quit as EVP in May 2013. This was followed by resignations of another EVP, Rajesh Varma, in January 2014 and then of CEO Sanjay Aggarwal a month later.The directors also quit to avoid facing angry employees. Mallya's closest aide  Ravi Nedungadi (who is now facing the heat from several government agencies with his boss)  resigned from the board in April 2014, along with independent directors  Air India's former acting CMD Subhash Gupte and Kapur. Bhasin resigned in March 2015.Today, the grounded airline lists Mallya as its CMD along with one Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy as additional director."

The water is stored at Kapur well from there is is supplied to the town of 5,000. Since last week, locals are complaining of foul odour coming from the water.D K Patil, town engineer of MJP and his team inspected the water supplied to the residential areas on Tuesday and Wednesday. The water was yellowish in colour and foul odour was emanating from it. ""We have collected samples for further tests. The water is not potable. We have asked the civic body not to provide drinking water unless it's cleaned,"" Patil said.Locals have alleged that a sugar factory in Asurle Pore is responsible for the water contamination. Similar complaints were raised in December last year, after which the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) had collected water samples; however, the results of the samples are still not known.The Panhala hill station municipal council has arranged for tankers to provide drinking water to the residents round-the-clock. Moreover, there are over 10 wells in the town.An official of MPCB said that they have kept a strict watch on the water released from the sugar factory. ""Last year, we had closed the factory for 15 days. Of the three lagoons in the factory to store polluted water, two were leaked. We will inspect what has happened this time,"" said an official.The factory is situated on the banks of Kasari river and the jackwell lifting water for Panhala is located nearby. The residents have complained that every year during sugarcane crushing, they are forced to use polluted water.Dinkar Chougule, local nature-lover had filed several complaints to the MJP and MPCB to take action against the factory.Panhala is one of the major tourist destinations in southern Maharashtra. The fort is situated at 18-km north-west of Kolhapur city. Panhala uplands are 2,772 feet above the sea and about 1,300 feet above the Kolhapur plain. The entire fort is about 7.5 in circumference."

Instead paint someone's life by choosing a colour based on their birth sign. According to city-based astrologers, colours have their own significance in different birth signs. For instance, pink and cream bring positivity in the life of Taureans and pale shades like off-white and cream calm the jostled nerves of Arians. For Sagittarians, red gives them a high energy.""Colour therapy is a recognized stream of medicine in which the patient suffering from a colour deficiency is advised to gain that colour balance in his system.

You can select your own colour on Holi and apply on others if you know the birth sign to have the best vibration of nature as well as friendship. Organic dry colours must be used instead of wet,"" said Madan Gupta Spatu, an astrologer.On this day, the scene of 'Holika burning to ashes' is enacted every year to mark the victory of good over evil. Holika was a demon who tried to kill Prahlad, the son of King Hiranyakashyap. The king had won over the kingdom of earth and was very egoistic. His son was a devotee of Lord Vishnu which he did not like and asked his sister to kill Prahlad. However, when she tried to kill him, she was burned to ashes.Holi comes on the conjunction of changing season coupled with religious backgrounds. This is why a day prior to Holi, Holika Dahan is performed where people gather around fire as burning of wood with several herbs purifies the atmosphere and makes it germs and virus-free.Time for Holika Dahan | 4:55pm to 5:31pmAries | Red, pale shades like off-white and cream calm jostled nerves of Arians.

Industry bosses could claim the tax is discriminatory because it will not hit other beverages with a high sugar content, like milkshakes, fruit juice and even coffee.If they were successful, they could force the tax to be scrapped.Leendert Den Hollander, vice-president and general manager of Coca-Cola, said in an interview at Retail Week that a sugar tax would not reduce childhood obesity.""We just believe there's no proof or evidence that sugar tax works. There's no evidence that calories significantly reduce after sugar tax,"" Mr Hollander said.Shares in drinks makers including Tizer and St Clement's producer AG Barr, Britvic and Vimto fell sharply after the announcement on Wednesday.Plans for a legal challenge heap further pressure on George Osborne following the Budget, which cost the Conservatives one member of the Cabinet when Iain Duncan-Smith resigned over cuts to disability payments.Analysis by the Office for Budget Responsibility has shown that the tax will cost 1 billion to implement, almost double the 520 million amount it is expected to raise, which Osborne has said will be set aside to fund sport in schools.Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, told the Guardian: ""This just reaffirms our view that this tax is ill-considered. The evidence does not suggest it will be effective and taxpayers will be left paying a heavy price for it."""

The order has pegged the value of the two assets at Rs 55 crore.The Enforcement Directorate, official sources said, has also put prohibitory orders on the factory, identified as Girna Sugar mill, and the land located adjacent to it.The agency, according to sources, found in its probe that the mill was purchased by Bhujbal's firm after ""gross under-valuation"" at Rs 27 crore and was purchased as part ofan auction conducted by the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in 2010. They said ""proceeds of crime"" of money laundering funds generated by the former deputy chief minister of the state and his family members were used to purchase these two assets.This is the fourth attachment order issued by the agencyin the case and it has already attached assets, both movableand immovable, worth Rs 280 crore earlier."

""Every year, around 10 lakh sugarcane labourers and nearly equal amount of construction workers seasonally migrate from Marathwada. Current estimates indicate that such seasonal migration has touched a whopping 50 lakh this year and is likely to increase in the coming days,"" he said.He said the large-scale migration is primarily going to affect employment in agricultural and allied businesses. ""A dearth of labours was felt by farmers during the rabi harvest season. Marathwada has around 100 cotton mills that were struggling to get raw cotton and labour due to the drought-like situation. Similarly, construction houses from the region are not finding labour they used to get in the past as many of them have already migrated,"" he claimed.Fringe areas in Pune, Nashik and Thane districts have been identified as possible areas where a major chunk of migrant population has shifted.Sharing her observations about drought-like situation in Marathwada, Parineeta Dandekar, associate coordinator with the advocacy group South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), said industries from the region were also finding it difficult to engage unskilled and semi-skilled labourers.""Industries have not only been struggling to get water, but also labourers. The employment scenario in general is grim as there are no takers for some category of jobs. Sugar industry is one of the affected areas. Parts of Marathwada have sugarcane growing belts and these were not getting labourers to harvest as easily as in past due,"" she said.Subhash Lomte of advocacy group Marathwada Pani Hakka Sangharsh Samiti said consecutive years of deficient-monsoon has resulted into drastic surge in seasonal migration. ""People are leaving their homes in search of water and livelihood. Such migration is going to have adverse impact on local economies as net production is going to come down,"" he said.Veteran economist and former member of Maharashtra State Planning Board H M Desarda said population shift would have adverse effect including worsening of issues arising out of urbanisation.""The government measures such as MNREGA and PDS should arrest the large-scale migration. Effective implementation of these schemes should take place along with other relief measures to help affected people stay back,"" he said.The state government has declared almost all villages in Marathwada as scarcity-hit, with an unprecedented number of tankers supplying drinking water in the eight districts of the region."

Thus, it's a struggle for those who are addicted, to keep away from them.""I was a sweet lover for many years. The enthusiasm has reduced over the years, mainly because of my age and the increasing number of diabetics in society. I do eat them but in moderation,"" said R Siva from Ganapathy Nagar.People are now consciously taking preventive measures to enjoy a healthy life. Afraid of becoming diabetic, several people have cut down on their consumption of sweets. Doctors have also been advising people to opt for foods with natural sugars like fruits.""If people eat too many sweets, it increases the blood sugar levels. Diabetic patients are more vulnerable. It is important they keep away from foods with processed sugars and opt for those with natural sugar which does not cause a dramatic change in the blood sugar level,"" said diabetes specialist Dr M Senthilvel.Endocrinologist Dr S Sridhar from Madurai also advices people to limit their intake of sweets.

This is the hunger which remains unsated even after one has had a hearty meal, in the absence of certain important micronutrients in the food.Various aspects of this hidden hunger were discussed during the annual scientific session of the city chapter of Nutrition Society of India (NSI). Senior scientists from NIN, Hyderabad K Madhavan Nair, GM Subba Rao and B Dinesh Kumar and city-based diabetologist Dr Sunil Gupta were among the faculty for the event. It was attended by a huge number of young researchers, nutritionists, students, medical agriculturists and other such professionals.""Most of the times, we satisfy our hunger pangs through food rich in macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins and fats. However, this often leaves the bodies requirement for micronutrients like iron, magnesium, vitamins and iodine unfulfilled. A big problem is that we often club together foods that inhibit the body's ability to absorb the micronutrients,"" informed Nair. He added that fat, which is avoided by a big majority these days, is good as it helps in bioabsorption of micronutrients.Rao believes that it is not enough to talk to individuals but to address the society as a whole to promote public health nutrition, taking the cultural aspects and prevalent food related culture in every region into account. ""One way the government has made things easier for us is introducing labels on packaged food that mention calorific content and sugar levels in them. This was an apt decision as the consumption of packaged food in India has increased by 300% in the last two decades,"" he said.Studies by NIN show that the compliance rate of mentioning nutrient content on food packages in 80-90% by manufacturers. ""The problem is that the consumers are not using this information to their benefit. Also, since there is low nutritional literacy in our country, many people cannot make sense of the information,"" added Rao.Alongside these changes in habits, the need for combating hunger still exists in the country, said Kumar. ""We need to exploit all possible methods of achieving this aim, including biotechnology. India has come to a stage where it can boast of a stringent set of regulations to ensure the food produced through recombinant technology are safe for feed, veterinary use and environment. The government has recently revived the Genetical Engineering Accreditation Board (GEAC) that ensures that even post marketing surveillance is strictly followed through,"" he said.With climate change knocking on our doors, we need crops that will withstand tough weather conditions, he added.IN A NUTSHELLMicro-nutrients include vitamins and mineralsDeficiencies of iron (anaemia), vitamin A and iodine are very common among Indians, specially adolescents and womenTwo food groups, namely fruits-vegetables and dairy products, are the major sources of micronutrientsHabits like having tea with meals inhibit the body's ability to absorb micronutrientsHaving fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C with every meal, eating minimally processed food, including some amount of fat in the diet and being physically active help in bioabsorption of micro-nutrients"

After the first survey, it declared that anewari of the district was around 70 paise as crop condition was satisfactory. The second survey brought the anewari down to 50 paise in eight out of the 16 tehsils. After the third survey, administration declared the anewari between 45 to 48 paise. (The anewari survey is conducted to ascertain drought or crop failure in a region. Under this parameter, loss of more than 50% is considered as crisis.) This report was made public on December 31. However, by then the state had already issued the government resolution (GR) extending financial assistance to drought-hit farmers leading to exclusion of several villages from the list of beneficiaries.As the GR has included affected crops like soyabean, sugar cane, banana, moong, udad etc and excluded cotton, only 1.67 lakh out of total 4.17 lakh farmers from the district are likely to be benefited from the relief package.Commenting on the situation, former zilla parishad chairman Devanand Pawar alleged that the ruling party leaders, including ministers, are interested only in allotting works under various government schemes to their cronies. ""One of the most lucrative businesses nowadays is bagging orders under the Jalyukt Shivar programme where contractors close to the ruling party leaders are preferred,"" Pawar claimed. He demanded probe into the alleged irregularities in implementation of the programme.Former social justice minister and Congress leader Shivajirao Moghe criticized the state's anti-farmer policies and claimed that the government has done nothing with regard to the interstate lower Penganga irrigation project.

And though Satish Rai's own story remains untold - until right now - the Sydney-based documentary filmmaker makes do with telling the tales of others like him, who set out in search of their roots, and stumbled upon cousins and family they never knew existed. For the uninitiated, Rai is the descendant of girmitiyas - indentured Indian labourers who travelled to Fiji and Caribbean Islands to work on sugar plantations in the early 19th century, upon signing an ""agreement"" - distorted eventually to be known as 'girmit' - with the British Government that promised them to return to India after they completed the term of their contractual agreement for work in Fiji and the Caribbean Islands. Many contracts were reneged upon, and only a few could return home. And for those like Satish Rai, the real homecoming could only happen nearly a century after his family first left the Indian shores. Rai's first visit to India was in 1994 - to Basti district - where his cousins were settled. A brush with a local rickshaw puller gave him his first brush with his caste - and his roots. ""He told me I am a Bhumihar Brahmin. And I didn't know what that meant,"" Rai said. The first trip yielded little ground. After two more visits, one in 1995 when a Brahmin priest led him on a wild goose chase, and a second in 2001 when he accompanied a cousin on her quest to find her family, Rai's own story saw mild progress. He said, ""During that time in Basti, there was a man who helped us and took us to Balrampur. He made me meet some people. Then, three months later, I got an email from him telling me my family had been traced. In 2004, I went back to Balrampur."" And here's the twist in Rai's tale. Satish Rai met his cousin, thrice removed, a man they knew by the name of Naeem Rai. ""This was a Muslim name. And I already knew my grandmother was a Hindu. So I knew it couldn't be the right family,"" Rai said. Whether it was curiosity or sheer desperation that drove him 15km into Balrampur's belly is unclear. But Rai was on his way the next morning, looking to dig for, and to find his roots. ""The first time I saw them, I felt the connection. The resemblance was uncanny,"" he said. But how did it happen? After the initial rush of emotion, the mystery unravelled. Rai's grandmother was married to a Rai Bahadur, a dominating, violent man, he said. And after suffering many years of domestic violence and abuse, she walked out on the Rai Bahadur. Staying away from the powerful landlord within the village would have been impossible, and Rai's grandmother took the next best available option; she boarded the ship to Fiji with Rai's grandfather, a man headed for greener pastures in the faraway lands. When the irate Rai Bahadur found out about her escape, though, he did the only thing that remained in his power to do: issue a diktat that disallowed all Hindu families in the area to wed. ""My grandmother's cousin at that time had four children. And to escape the bizarre diktat, they all converted to Islam. The family name of Rai, however, stuck."" For Satish Rai, the family name served as the final missing piece in his quest to find his family. A century after his grandmother boarded that ship to Fiji, Satish hugged his cousin Naeem and celebrated his homecoming."

Modi did not suggest any immediate interventions of his own.The long term impact on commodity markets could be significant.Last month, India made its first purchases of corn in 16 years. It has also been increasing purchases of other products, such as lentils and oilmeals, as production falls short.Wheat and sugar stocks, while sufficient in warehouses now, are depleting fast, leading some traders to predict the need for imports next year.""There's a complete collapse of agriculture, and that's because of the callous neglect by the government,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst.""Given the state of agriculture, I'm not surprised to see India emerging as an importer of a number of food items. Maize is just the beginning.""Agriculture contributes nearly 13% to India's $2 trillion economy and employs about two-thirds of its 1.25 billion people.Government sources said that boosting irrigation, raising crop yields and encouraging farmers to avail of a new crop insurance scheme unveiled in January will help address growing distress in the countryside caused by poor harvests.Modi has already loosened controls on some imports.But one of his biggest dilemmas is that although imports can help cool prices - a key concern for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's core middle-class voter base - farmers see them as benefiting foreign producers at the cost of locals.In a recent interview with television channel ET Now, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was aware of the impact two bad monsoons have had.""That now tells me, please spend more on irrigation,"" he said.The farm sector needs to grow at about 3 percent to help Jaitley achieve his target of 7 to 7.5% economic growth in the 2015/16 fiscal year.In the first half of this fiscal year, agricultural growth fell to 2% from 2.4% a year earlier.India's entry into the market as a net importer is good news for suppliers like Brazil, Argentina, the United States and Canada, which are suffering from a global commodity glut.India's move to import corn, for example, has supported global prices. Corn values rose 2.6% after India said on January 13 that it would launch a second tender for 200,000 tonnes, its second since announcing plans to buy half a million tonnes.Traders say India may need to import another 1.5-2.0 million tonnes.The next big import item on the list could be oilmeals, an animal feed, which India used to export in large quantities until last year.""Very soon we'll be left with no choice but to import oilmeals, largely because our oilseed production has failed to keep pace with our demand for both vegetable oils and oilmeals,"" said BV Mehta, head of trade body Solvent Extractors' Association."

Hardly anybody in my family had heard about golf,"" said Jaglan, whose father earned 10,000 rupees ($150) a month from farming a small plot of land.Jaglan's passion for what remains a rich man's sport in India started when a US-based golfing enthusiast opened a coaching clinic in his hamlet, not far from the capital New Delhi.Although the clinic closed three months later because youngsters were more interested in other, traditional Indian sports, Jaglan was hooked and continued practising his drives in the fields.For chipping and putting, his father set up an improvised three-hole green in the family garage, while sand piled on top of the roof served as a practice bunker.""We knew the sport was expensive, the equipment and all,"" said his father Jagpal Jaglan, who is now his caddie. ""It was a big struggle initially. Everything appeared beyond us.""But our son was so passionate about this sport that we decided to give it our all,"" he said.Jaglan's achievements -- his handicap is already down to zero, or ""scratch"" in golfing parlance -- now dominate conversation in the quiet village where elders spend the days sipping chai (tea) and smoking hookah on charpoys (traditional furniture) outside their homes.As Jaglan started competing in local junior tournaments, his talent began to dominate talk among Delhi's golfing elite.An intrigued Nonita Lal Qureshi, one of India's best-known women golfers, travelled to Israna village in Haryana state for a first-hand look at the young player.""I was really impressed by what I saw. But I wanted to test him further, so I invited him for a nine-hole game in Delhi,"" she told AFP.""What I then witnessed just blew me away.""I told the family they would have to move to Delhi if they wanted their son to become a golfing star.""For the family of three used to rural village life, it was a huge decision to make.But the move has been eased by the Golf Foundation, a local sports charity run by former golfer Amit Luthra which helped find them cheap accommodation near the Delhi Golf Club.The prestigious club has given Jaglan free membership, while a reputed public school has waived his tuition fees.And his trips to the US to compete at top junior level have also been funded by the same charity.""Had there been proper facilities back in our village, I think I would have stayed there because that's my native place, I could get to be with all my friends,"" Jaglan said wistfully.Jaglan, who idolises Spanish legend Seve Ballesteros, knows he faces huge challenges to compete on the world stage, but says he dreams of one day winning the US Masters.Only three Indians have ever qualified for the major championship which takes place in April at Augusta: Anirban Lahiri, the current Asian Tour Order of Merit champion who is ranked in the world's top 50, veteran Jeev Milkha Singh and Arjun Atwal.""He is an exceptional talent no doubt,"" Qureshi said, throwing a glance at Jaglan as he practised, wearing a pale green jumper with his name embossed on the collar.""Our job is to keep him grounded,"" said Qureshi, who has taken up coaching Jaglan.""God willing if everything goes well, who knows, we have a star in the making."""

He said the nexus between BSP and SP on the one hand, and sugar mills on the other, is solely responsible for the deplorable state of the state's sugarcane farmers.Shah was inaugurating the national executive meeting of BJP's Kisan Morcha, and addressed local BJP workers and office bearers of the Morcha. The event, though, drew sparse crowds. Among them was Sanjay Rana, father of Vishal, the key suspect behind the lynching of Mohammed Akhlaq.Among other things, Shah blamed Congress for the crisis in the country's agriculture sector, and mentioned in contrast several schemes the ruling Narendra Modi government has instituted to render relief to farmers.Sugarcane farmers, though, were his prime target, evident from his crackdown on UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and the BSP leadership for ""ignoring core issues troubling sugarcane farmers"". ""Under Modiji's leadership, issues of sugarcane farmers are taken seriously. Sugarcane farmers are not facing any problem in Gujarat. For similar changes in UP, you need to change the government,"" Shah said.He harked to history to claim that agricultural registers growth under BJP regimes. ""During BJP rule, agricultural growth rate rises as BJP is the only party which thinks and acts for farmers. Over 60% of India's population is directly or indirectly associated with farming. Accordingly, over 60% of Modiji's efforts are directed towards rendering benefits to farmers,"" he said.""In its 60 years in power, Congress has led the agricultural system to a collapse. Today, farmers are dependant on sugar mills. To add to their woes, SP and BSP are have exploited farmers in connivance with mill owners. There is drought in 302 districts of the country, for which Congress is responsible as no efforts were made to revive agriculture. No new irrigation facility was built during the UPA reign, while urea units shut shop,"" said Shah, adding that the Modi government has raised use of ethanol in petrol from 1% to 10%, which should be beneficial to sugarcane farmers. Ethanol is manufactured from sugarcane.He said the Centre is also exploring how to make agriculture loan free, with a Krishi Fasal Bima Yojna being under consideration, adding that six urea units have been restarted and neem-coated urea is being promoted to prevent the fertilizer from being diverted to other uses. ""The insurance scheme will cover all agricultural issues. The Centre is working on the concept of maximum production yield and minimum input cost. We don't want agricultural science reduced to books and labs. Hence, we're working on a lab-to-land concept,"" said Shah, adding the government is also working on a soil health card, which will soon be distributed in Rajasthan.He mentioned how the Centre was promoting agro-based units and online mandis across the country. He exhorted party workers to promote modernisation of mandis, shwet andolan (white, or milk revolution) and to directly connect with farmers. He urged promotion of animal farming, saying two buffaloes and a cow can push a family from below the poverty line to above it.In the second day of the two-day meet, Union home minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to address party workers on Tuesday."

And if you relish the flavours of piping hot tomato soups, then the latest trend is a tempting option. Souping or an all-soup diet is catching up with individuals looking to shed some kilos and cleanse their system.Typically a three-day routine, souping involves replacing lunch and dinner meals with a bowl of fresh, homemade soup. ""The diet plan includes soups coupled with a bowl of boiled vegetables, fruits, nuts or sprouts. Packaged soups aren't allowed,"" says Suhasini Viswanathan, dietitian, Qua Nutrition.While oil cannot be used, the soups can have a little salt, pepper and herbs. "" Adding a piece of ginger or garlic is advisable for delicate stomachs. The diet doesn't include dairy products, eggs, sugar and non-vegetarian dishes,"" says Suhasini, adding that one portion of cabbage soup is a must.Experts say souping is helpful as it adds a lot of fibre, water, vitamins and minerals to the fare. But certain soups must be avoided. ""Clear soups aren't recommended as they have few calories and can increase the appetite,"" says consultant dietitian Dr Dharini Krishnan, adding that high-calorie creamy soups are off the menu too. Pre-diabetics, diabetics and those on medication must refrain from following this diet as they require planned meals with sufficient carbohydrates after medication.Following the diet has had mixed outcomes. Some people have lost weight and felt `lighter' while others have returned to their cheesy burgers. ""I lost two kilos after trying it with professional guidance as the diet was tailored to my needs,""says Krithika Vidyasagar, who tried the routine recently .The all-soup diet is replacing its juice counterpart as it is considered healthier. ""Juicing adds vitamin C, potassium and some fibre but in souping, the diet has more nutrients,"" says Dr Dharini.However, like any dietary fad, this too can land you in a soup.Giving up on your cravings may help you lose some fat, but a sudden dietary shift is unhealthy. ""People develop nutritional deficiencies when their intake doesn't involve supplements. Mood swings, headaches, exhaustion, and a constant craving for food are common side-effects,"" says Dr Kousalya Nathan, lifestyle and anti-ageing consultant, Apollo Nova Hospital. She adds that a nutritionist's consultation is crucial.It is also essential to keep a watch over one's diet even after the souping detox to maintain weight. ""Diets restricted to one food group, like vegetables, can be followed for a short period as they can cause nutritional imbalances in the long run,"" says Dr Dharini."

While most of the biomass plants, which contribute 200 MW to TN, use sugar molasses as fuel, the bio-CNG plant can process 10 tonnes of food waste every day.The plant was inaugurated by Union minister for state- power, coal, new and renewable energy Piyush Goyal, on Saturday. Speaking at the launch, Goyal lauded the unique model and asked for it to be emulated by 6,000 towns in the country. ""I see that the plant is headed in the right direction towards Swacch Bharat,"" he added.The plant will work on aerobic digestion of biomass to produce biogas which can be further enriched to make it an autograde CNG equivalent devoid of toxic gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. The Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) generated by the plant will power streetlights in MWC and the research valley, two buses that ply within the campus and tractors used in the campus.Close to 50,000 people working in 64 companies in Mahindra City enter the campus daily and spend at least eight hours and consuming at least one meal. The daily waste amounts to eight tonnes. ""Initially we thought of dumping them in landfills. But since it adds to the pollution we planned this project,"" said Mahindra fuels technology general manager Jeevan Dass. The bio-CNG plant is fed with manually-segregated food waste from kitchens within the campus."

The law and judiciary department has issued a government resolution (GR) stating that the Siddhivinayak Temple will fund the education of children of farmers who committed suicide after failing to deal with natural disasters like drought and heavy rainfall that damaged their yields.""We have received the GR and we have already sent a copy to all district collectors asking them to send the details of such farmers and their children,"" said Sanjeev Patil, chief executive officer of the Siddhivinayak Temple Trust. He added that the temple authorities had decided to fund the education of these children till graduation. ""Our committee is in the process of working out the criteria. Education of the children will be funded from the date that the GR has been issued,"" said Patil, adding that the cut-off year has not yet been decided.To begin with, the temple trust has set aside Rs 1 crore for the scheme that will be popularized as 'Siddhivinayak Scholarship Scheme'. The annual proceeds collected by the temple add up to Rs 65 crore. The temple currently implements several schemes like subsidized dialysis, donations for medical procedures etc. ""Farmer suicides have been a concern for the state since long. We had floated the idea of doing something for the education of the farmer's children and that is when this plan came about,"" said Patil, adding that the temple trust approached the government with the plan. After studying the possibilities, the GR was issued.Farm activist Kishore Tiwari, who is the president of Shetkari Sawalambhan Mission said that it is a good initiative by the temple trust. ""However, there are lakhs of farmers who are unable to fund the education of their children as they cannot afford it. Such farmers should be helped by the trust so that they don't take the drastic decision of ending their lives,"" said Tiwari, adding over 96 lakh farmer families have been affected due to drought in Maharashtra. Since 1997, Maharashtra has recorded 70,000 farmer suicides.In 2014, Maharashtra recorded 1981 farmer suicides and 1,296 cases in 2013. The arid region of Marathwada recorded 438 cases till June, accounting for 34 per cent of the total cases. The north Maharashtra belt has recorded 158 cases. The sugar bowl of western Maharashtra accounted for 32 cases while the Konkan region has reported only one case so far this year.However, only 55 per cent of the suicides recorded by the revenue department so far have been declared eligible for compensation. To be considered an ""eligible suicide"", the land has to be in the victim's name and there should be evidence of indebtedness. The government claims only these cases are linked to agrarian distress."
