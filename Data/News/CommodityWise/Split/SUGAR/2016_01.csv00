Kaliachak, where violence erupted earlier this month, is considered a major production centre for opium and a hub of cross-border smuggling. While narcotics are trafficked across the border to Bangladesh, Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) is received in return. This FICN is circulated from Kaliachak to the rest of the country. It is suspected that those involved in the attack on Kaliachak police station on January 3 have links with this illegal trade. Even Bangladeshi smugglers are suspected to have been present when the violence occurred.""We are conducting a drive to destroy poppy plants in the Sahabajpur Mouza that is close to the international border. Apart from BSF personnel, excise department staff and officers from the local police station are involved in this activity. So far, we have succeeded in destroying poppy plants on 1,450 bighas of land. We are using tractors and other far equipment to detroy the plants. Security personnel have been deployed to prevent any law and order situation,"" a senior BSF officer said on Saturday.This part of Kaliachak is also known as mini-Afghanistan considering the fact that a large number of residents are involved in the drug trade, FICN smuggling and gunrunning. Just as India is concerned with FICN pouring in from across the border, Bangladesh has been complaining for several years against narcotics and weapons entering its soil through the Malda border. The recent clampdown by officials may have led to the unprecedented violence earlier this month. The poppy, cultivated in the border areas of Golapganj, Sahabajpur and Sasani Parbadyanathpur is converted into Opium, Brown Sugar and Heroin. The poppy crop is sown in November-December and harveted in February-March.""We started our operations from January 8. We suspect that local criminals were aware that we would launch this drive and made an attempt to thwart us by engaging in violence on January 3. However, this ploy did not work and all state and central agencies have come together to destroy the crop. In 2015, we had destroyed poppy being cultivated on nearly 5,573 bighas in Kaliachak and neighbouring parts,"" the officer added.Additional excise commissioner Subrata Biswas, who has also been the zonal director of NCB said: ""We managed to contain this problem in North Dinajpur. We are hopeful that the cultivation at Malda will be contained now."""

The state government had given bank guarantee for giving fresh temporary loan to the Vasantdada co-op mill. We are ready to give NOC to the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank if its gives loan to the sugar mill.""Sources from the Niphad Co-operative sugar mill said, ""Our factory is closed for the past three years due to financial problems.

District collector Saini, municipal commissioner P Siva Sankar, additional district collector Ajit Pawar and officials of the revenue and water resources departments were also present at the meetings.""At present, water is stored in four large, nine medium and 54 small dams in the district. Though the difference between the water stock in January 2015 and today is 22%, the district administration has already prepared a contingency plan (to tackle water scarcity). The administration is taking efforts that the people of Kolhapur district do not face any major inconvenience like other parts of the state,"" Patil said.""In some areas, we have decided to stop water lifting for irrigation purpose from the river beds. Though, such bans are restricted to a few weeks, we are hopeful of saving a lot of water through the initiative,"" he said.""The state government is promoting drip irrigation, which saves a lot of water. This summer, the district administration too will promote it on a large scale so that more farmers shift from flow-based irrigation to smart concepts such as drip-irrigation, which also helps in increasing the yield,"" the minister said.Patil said the existing co-operative sugar factories would be asked to promote and implement drip irrigation technology among the sugarcane cultivators in the command areas of the respective factories. ""Sugarcane is a water intense crop. Hence, judicious use of water is necessary,"" he added.Rivers such as the Panchganga and Bhogawati in Kolhapur district are the main source of water. Hence, the water resources department has put temporary ban on water lifting from the river beds. The ban will continue in February as well.On January 2, the district administration released a data claiming that 425 of the 1,700 villages in the district are facing water scarcity. The administration then prepared some plans and started supplying water to the nearby lakes and wells so that the villagers' were met.According to the agriculture department, the district received 634.9mm rainfall till October 15 as the average of 1,772.4 mm."

The NGO said it has put digital flexes near few sugar factories in the district and prepared informative brochures as well.""Avani is running as many as 34 temporary schools across Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur districts. To raise awareness among the beneficiaries, we published and handed over the brochures to the parents living near sugar factories and brick kilns. Villages including Khupire, Donwade, Sablewadi, Koparde, Kuditre, Shiroli, Udgaon and Chinchwad in the district are being covered under the awareness drive,"" said Sattappa Mohite, a member of the NGO.He said the dropout rates of children belonging to these migrant families are higher. Hence, such families need to know about the benefits under the RTE Act.""Education is free and so are other facilities. Moreover, the parents can also continue their wards' education later in the school of their original village. Since these families are very poor, they generally refrain from getting their children educated,"" Mohite said.He said currently as many as 750 kids in the age group of 3-5 years are learning in KGs. Besides, the NGO has enrolled over 360 children aged six years and above in the nearby Zilla Parishad schools.""In fact, we have also made transport arrangement for children needing travel assistance to reach schools in far-off places. The private transport arrangement has assisted around 45 students. Any other student facing transport problems too will be assisted in future,"" he said.Mohite said the decision to implement the online admission system needs to be reviewed, as many poor families are hardly aware of the process. The administration should rather focus on sensitizing them about the admission process, he said.On the RTE Act, Mohite said economically and socially disadvantaged children as well as those with disabilities can be admitted in Class I or at the pre-primary stage of private unaided and minority aided schools. These children receive free education, including textbooks, and other facilities, he added."

A blaze at a neighboring fuel tank facility in April took a week to snuff out and stopped trucks from unloading soybeans."

Though the latest letter to schools is not the first time CBSE has raised this issue, the urgency and seriousness is prodded by a central government report slamming the ""easy availability"" of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) in school canteens. The report, prepared by a working group constituted by ministry of women and child development (MCD), has suggested a complete ban on HFSS not only inside campus but also within a 200 meter periphery (during school hours).Stepping up pressure on schools, CBSE secretary Joseph Emmanuel on Thursday wrote that ""it is expected that all schools affiliated to CBSE will take the necessary measures"". While the board has not mentioned what penal action it will take against erring schools, the letter's tone clearly suggests that it means business. Schools have been asked to constitute a School Canteen Management Committee (SCMC), which will take charge of menu preparation. Emmanuel wrote that the SCMC should have ""about 7-10 members including teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators. The committee will coordinate, implement and monitor the guidelines to make safe food available to students in the school"".The MCD report said child obesity is one of the biggest concerns in India and suggested that ""incorporation of healthy snacks needs to be right at the top of the agenda and intensive intervention should be undertaken by the government along with active involvement of parents, teachers and community as a whole"".Well-known city-based paediatrician Dr Rajiv Mohta agrees, saying, ""Healthy eating is a lifestyle and that has to be practised by parents, which eventually children will follow. Once in school, the availability of food items can be controlled and snacks like poha, upma etc should be made available. Even when serving idli, sambar dal must be compulsorily mixed so that it's a perfect combination of carbs and proteins."" Even the MCD report suggests that the above mentioned items along with cutlet, stuffed paratha, dalia, pulao etc can be introduced as healthy options on the menu.Schools too welcomed CBSE's push in this regard and accepted that they have a key role to play. Sumathi Venugopalan, principal of Centre Point School (Wardhaman Nagar), said, ""It is possible to implement this change in schools because if we don't provide unhealthy snacks students will not buy it. There are a variety of options available in Indian cuisine, so it shouldn't be difficult to substitute unhealthy options with healthier ones.""Akhilesh Chaturvedi, principal of Delhi Public School, said, ""This option is feasible and we are trying to implement this in our school by banning such items from our canteen. We do not promote the consumption of unhealthy snacks but if students bring those items from home, we can't possibly check lunch boxes of all students.""IS Tuli, director of Edify School, said, ""It is practically not possible to ban all unhealthy options, but we can control them. Heeding the advice of CBSE, we have hired a caterer and by doing this we give our students homemade snacks, which are more beneficial for their health.""Shashikala Naidu, principal of Jain Heritage school, said, ""It is an extremely positive step taken by CBSE because children today practically live on junk food. We confiscate any junk the students carry, so that at least for the majority of their day they stay away from unhealthy choices.""Ensuring that snacks prepared in canteen are not only healthy but appealing is key according to Bharti Bijwe, principal of Sandipani School.

He emphasized that in three years National Sugar Institute would be developed as an institute of international standard.He also mentioned that due to the efforts of his government the dues of sugarcane farmers of Rs 12,000 crores have come down to Rs 3400 crores. Of this amount, 1450 crores are dues of sugarcane farmers of Uttar Pradesh alone.""It is in our priority to ensure that Made In India products meet international standard in terms of quality"", said Ram Vilas. ""Upon the implementation of Food Security Act, every individual will get five kgs of grain in a month. Also he will get wheat at Rs 2 per kg and rice at Rs 3 per kg. After FSA coming in affect, APL and BPL card system will come to an end"", said Ram Vilas. He further mentioned that the country would be requiring 610 lakh metric tonnes food grains after implementation of FSA act.""UP alone will require 96 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains"", he added. The implementation of the FSA Act will ensure that all the depots are online and it could be known easily how much stock is kept in the godowns. At present, the godowns of Food Corporation of India (FCI) is done by the state governments, said the union minister. Talking about the bill to amend the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 which is 30 year old, Food minister said that the union government is making sincere efforts to amend the bill which is at present with the standing committee after getting passed from the Lok Sabha.

On getting passed from the upper house, the bill will become an act.The minister said that the government looks forward to strengthen the infrastructure of the consumer court for which the judicial process should be simplified. This will ensure that the consumer will not have to run pillar to post.Paswan while highlighting the features of the bill to be cleared by the standing committee said that if a person makes purchases suppose in Delhi and is a resident of Kanpur, for lodging a complaint against the substandrad project, he will not have to go to Delhi to do the needful instead the same procedure could be done in the city of his residence. Also the consumer will not require to hire a lawyer to fight a case in the consumer court, instead he will be able to defend himself of his own.Further addressing the newspersons, Paswan said that his government is committed to put a ban on the astray advertisements. Praising NSI, Paswan said that efforts would be made to take NSI to an international height for which all required help would be given to the institute."

Also, the Kumuda Sugars had submitted deposits worth Rs 1 crore with the KDCC for signing the deal. But later it withdrew from the deal.Consequently, the KDCC board of directors met on Saturday and decided to sell the factory to recover the dues and settle the issue forever. Fresh tenders will be floated on Tuesday. As per the reports released by the bank, Daulat sugar factory has cumulative dues of Rs 350 crore. Of this, Rs 65 crore is basic loan amount.""The bank has been facing financial crisis for the past few years due to such bad loans. We have the land and the machinery, which we will sell and recover the dues,"" officials said.There had been eight tenders from time to time to lease out the factory but all attempts were in vain.Local leaders like Narsingh Gurunath Patil, who was controlling Daulat, is against leasing out of the factory. If the factory goes to any other operator, Patil fears losing chances of making a comeback in the local politics because sugar factories are a major tool to influence a tehsil's politics.State cooperation minister Chandrakant Patil has expressed his disapproval of Bhosale taking control of Daulat sugars. Patil on Friday said that the factory should fall in good hands."

The sugarcane growers in the district were demanding to fix the price at Rs 3,000.""Considering all aspects, including the financial condition of the factory and the cost factor in sugarcane cultivation, the authorities have decided to increase the price,"" said Muralidhara Mallick, managing director of the sugar factory.""Due to increase in input costs, we demanded to fix the procurement price at Rs 3,000 per tonne,"" said general secretary of Ganjam District Sugarcane Growers' Association Samira Pradhan. The factory authorities should provide bonus of Rs 20 per tonne to each sugarcane grower on and above the sugarcane procurement price, he said.Pradhan said the sugarcane growers would show interest to cultivate the crop if the sugar industry provides proper price to them. The factory will run for more days and make profit when the acreage of the sugarcane is increased, he said.The association has demanded introduction of sugarcane crop insurance taking panchayat as a unit.The sugarcane cultivation area in the district has reduced drastically in last some years as the farmers have switched over to other crops. They found sugarcane was no more a profit-making crop, said vice-president of the association Narayan Jena. Around a decade ago, sugarcane was grown on 12,000 acres. It has reduced to 6,000 acres, he said.Processing of the sugarcane is scheduled to start from second week of next month. The factory authorities have targeted to crush around 80,000 metric tonnes of sugarcane this year against the last year's 98,000 metric tonnes, factory sources said. ""We have lowered the target this time because the coverage of sugarcane has come down,"" Mallick said."
58f1840ea3d24b245e59af5f,"Poor Indian women seeking jobs confront taboos, threats",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Poor-Indian-women-seeking-jobs-confront-taboos-threats/articleshow/50790882.cms,2016-01-31,"On a humid, sweaty, honking afternoon last summer, two women were making their way through the court complex in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut, searching for the office of the sub-divisional magistrate.They walked past the purveyors of stamp papers and affidavits, typists clickety-clacking on stools, lawyers in flapping gowns, pillars of wadded files bound in twine.It is fair to say that these two did not belong. They had the swaying walk of village women who have spent their lives balancing bundles of firewood on their heads. When they entered the office of a criminal defense lawyer, in the sweat-stained broom closet where he receives clients, they were at first so conscious of their low status that they tried to sit on the floor.They were engaging his services because they wanted to work. They lived 10 miles away, in a small settlement where, for generations, begging had been the main source of income. A few weeks earlier, the male elders of their caste had decreed that village women working at nearby meat-processing factories should leave their jobs. The reason they gave was that women at home would be better protected from the sexual advances of outside men. A bigger issue lay beneath the surface: The women's earnings had begun to undermine the old order.It came as a surprise when seven of the women, who had come to rely on the daily wage of Rs 200, refused to stop. The women would have to, the men said, blocking the lane with their bodies. They did not expect the women to go to the police.It would have been impossible  this appeal to the distant, abstract power of the state  if the women had not been so angry.Geeta, the younger of the two, was born angry. Even as a child, if her siblings took her portion of food, she was apt to throw everyone's dinner into the dirt.Her friend Premwati was a more cautious sort. In the tradition of their caste, the Nats, a person challenging a community punishment could offer a defense at trial by picking up a red-hot piece of iron and walking five steps toward the temple. If her hands burned, she was guilty, and would be placed in a hole in the ground until she confessed.They had wandered into dangerous territory, she and Geeta. She knew that. When evening fell in the village of Peepli Khera, Premwati would crouch over her clay stove, rolling chapatis in and out of the embers, and survey the forces arrayed against them. Too poor to afford a house with a door, she lay at night under a thatched roof, listening for the footsteps of people she could not see.Last summer, as they fought to remain in the workforce, Geeta and Premwati made up a small part of a big economic puzzle.In India, around 27 per cent of women participate in the labor force, a figure which is lower than any other country in the G-20, except for Saudi Arabia. Standard models suggest that a lucky confluence of factors  economic expansion, rising education levels and plummeting fertility  would draw women swiftly into India's economy.Instead, the opposite is happening: From 2005 to 2012, women's participation rates slid to 27 per cent from 37 per cent, largely because rural women were dropping out of the workforce. Of 189 countries studied by the International Labour Organization, India ranks 17th from the bottom.This is terrible news for India, as it strains to become a competitive producer for world markets. Economists have put forward two theories to explain the decline. The first is that India's boom has created jobs in segments that are generally not accessible to women, like construction. The second has to do with culture: Unless their choices are dictated by destitute poverty, Indian families seek the status that comes from keeping women at home.The Nat families were just crossing that threshold, and many things were changing. Premwati and Geeta could feel the grip of the local moneylenders loosening; the taste of independence made them bold. In this way, over five months last spring and summer, the unstoppable force of economic need met the immovable object of social control.The cost of remaining in the workforce, they discovered, was very high.At 10 o'clock on a morning in May, Geeta and Premwati set off on foot to the meat-processing factories. As they approached, they pulled their scarves over their faces against the smell, a stomach-turning odor that wafts off tallow-rendering vats and suggests rotting meat. Over the last five years, with the market for flash-frozen buffalo meat booming in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and China, India had quietly become the world's largest meat exporter. The factories outside Meerut were expanding.For this reason, about five years earlier, Geeta and her friends had been drawn into the labor force, supplementing their husbands' seasonal earnings as wedding-band musicians. Inside the boundary walls of the factories, they broke rocks into rubble and carried cement mix in shallow pans, balanced on the crowns of their heads, to stonemasons building interior walls. Some washed meat pans; some assembled cartons; some carried bricks.At night, returning home, they withdrew sweaty, folded bills from their blouses. A hollow-eyed woman named Pooja announced, with some surprise, that her husband and mother-in-law had stopped beating her. ""When you earn money,"" she said, ""you are of some use to them.""Premwati, whose husband spent most days stretched out drunk on his rope cot, felt, for the first time in years, that she was standing on solid ground. With her earnings she married off three children. One last son needed settling. Then she could exhale.Geeta's plans were wilder, more improbable. In the financial cooperative that the village women had formed, pooling their resources and extending loans, she proved to be an excellent, if frightening, debt-collector. She took advances on her salary, which were interest-free, rather than patronizing the local moneylenders. Then, last spring, she attracted attention by building a second house for herself, of rosy, freshly kilned brick, abutting the compound of Roshan, the village's most powerful man.When Roshan, the Nat chief in Peepli Khera, is ready to perform an exorcism, he starts out by asking a coy question: ""Do you want to see the real drama?""Then he trembles. His eyes roll back, he arches his tongue against his teeth like the goddess Kali, who communicates to him through a string of wooden beads that he holds up to his ear, as if it were a cellphone. Nat families come from miles away to see Roshan, who claims to be able to evict the jinns that have inhabited their bodies.In the half-light of evening, Roshan surveys the settlement, his chest thrown out. Villagers live in a few dozen houses arranged around a whitewashed temple. With the arrival of the factories, Roshan's village was being swallowed. He forbade the women in his own family to work at the factories. He looked back with nostalgia at the time when the Nats supported themselves by begging.""Life was much better 20 years back,"" he said. ""It was a nice society. Now women are going out and meeting strange men.""In the spring of last year, after Geeta built her new house, Roshan's son Dharmender began observing her with interest. He noted she wore new outfits. He scanned her friends' faces for traces of makeup. He shared his suspicion that they worked at an air-conditioned site.Their work, he said, had a whiff of immorality.""They have everything: Clothes to wear. Enough to eat,"" he said. ""Why would they need to work? They still have husbands. It's not just insulting to them, it's insulting to the whole village.""It was difficult to say where the rumor started. It concerned Geeta's neighbor Pinki, who had fair skin and a little girl's high, fluting voice. She was married with one child and worked at one of the new construction sites, breaking rocks with a hammer. Some reported that Pinki had been seen riding on a strange man's motorcycle, others that a man from the construction site had shown up at her family home.In May, Roshan vanished into the temple to present the matter to his most trusted authority: the goddess Kali. After a long conversation over the magic necklace, he emerged saying that the goddess had shared a piece of disturbing news. Women in the village, he said, were engaged in prostitution.""If Kali tells us this person is wrong,"" he said, ""this person is wrong.""It was decided: The village's women would stop working.Geeta gathered a war council on the floor of her house. They were a party of seven, including Premwati, Pinki and another neighbor, Rekha. Geeta's proposal was to ignore Roshan's ban. If their female neighbors were willing to quit their jobs, it was only out of fear. The fear would fade, maybe in a month, maybe in two. In the meantime, she told her friends, they had the full support of the Indian government.The government she had in mind was a Muslim politician named Jahiruddin Mewati, who had served as chief of the village of Peepli Khera until a few years earlier, and who was running again in the fall.Mewati's study of politics, especially the tactics of the British Raj, had persuaded him that there was much to be gained  specifically, votes  by inserting himself into local controversies. With all adult men and women counted, there are about 150 votes in the Nat community, nothing to sneeze at in a district where elections are won by a margin of 20 or 30. When Geeta appeared in his reception area, a collection of plastic chairs arranged under a tree, he smelled opportunity.""Nobody can stop them from going to work,"" he said staunchly. ""We don't have a Taliban here. It's a democracy.""Heartened, the women decided they would simply leave for work in the morning. Except, when they did, their neighbors were standing there, telling them to stop.""On 18.05.2015 at 9:00am, I was going for work,"" reads the report filed at the police station in Kharkhauda, signed with Pinki's thumbprint and written in the hand of their sponsor, Mewati.""These people started saying that we were told not to go to the factory, because bad things are happening at the factory. These people became angry and started abusing me and they threatened to kill me. I request you to lodge my report and take legal action.""When word got out that the women had gone to the police, Roshan's son Dharmender was the one sent to tell them how they would be punished. From this point forward all seven women would be outcasts.Geeta, Premwati and their friends tried to wrap their heads around it. As children they had heard of the rite of ostracism  it was used to frighten them into obedience  but they had never seen it imposed. At first they found ways to adjust, avoiding a confrontation with their neighbors by sticking to the lanes and handpumps that had been constructed with government money.A few days passed before the finger of the punishment touched them. Geeta's teenage niece greeted the girl next door and watched her glide by wordlessly, like a ghost. Rekha dialed the numbers of relatives, one after the other, and when she told them what had happened to her, they hung up.Dharmender was astounded that the seven women persisted in going to work. The whole thing was strange, Dharmender said. The women had been offered a deal, allowing them back in the community if they confessed to ""immoral acts"" and paid a fine, but they had refused it. Ostracism was such a severe punishment that dissenters usually relented within 24 hours, paying whatever fine the elders demanded. Geeta and her friends had already lived as outcasts for three months. ""Who,"" he wondered aloud, ""would be willing to suffer so much?""The women, too, were in uncharted territory. Every two weeks, they made a trip to the magistrate's court in Meerut to renew a restraining order that the police had recommended, which would impose a 50,000-rupee fine on anyone who resorted to violence.Their lawyer, Mohammed Yusuf Siddiqui, had rarely sat across his desk from such nervous clients. In his practice, it was not unusual to see state justice conflict with caste justice. One of his clients, who had appealed to court in order to obtain a divorce, had been assigned a punishment by his village council, to spit on the ground and then lick the spit.Still, there was something unusual about these women, who signed each document with a thumbprint. Siddiqui watched them curiously.""They know nothing about court procedure,"" he said. ""They never ask me questions. They just say one thing: 'We are not wrong. We are not wrong. We are not wrong.'""Around the hearths of the Nat women, the ones who had agreed to resign their jobs, pressure was building. They wanted to be loyal to the community elders, but by September, stripped of the Rs 200 a day that had been supporting their families, they were running out of money.Geeta's neighbor, an imposing woman known as Big Suman, surveyed the homesteads one by one with the experienced eye of a general. On one of her rounds, Big Suman spotted something peculiar: A widow with grown children was trudging back from the nearest town with a sack of flour balanced on her head. Big Suman did a double-take. She knew what begging looked like. This was an activity the Nats were trying to leave behind.That morning, Big Suman visited all the women who had resigned from the factories. They agreed that they would take their case to the one person who could clear the way for them to work again.When Mewati, the Muslim politician from down the road, saw the crowd of women enter his courtyard, he perked up. Local elections were two months away and he was feeling lively, like a bear coming out of hibernation. Several days later, at 7:30 one morning in September, he bumped down the road in his decrepit Maruti Gypsy jeep.He parked the Gypsy in front of Roshan's homestead, and a series of Mewati's male cousins unfolded themselves from the back seat, assuming positions in Roshan's yard. The two headmen sat down on a rope cot, exchanging compliments.Mewati assembled the villagers and informed them that the Indian Constitution guaranteed equality under the law. Women could not be prevented from working, and Geeta and her friends should be forgiven. Then he withdrew Rs 3,000 in folded bills from his pocket, enough to cover the fine for Geeta's disobedience, and handed it to Roshan.The machinery of compromise cranked into motion. Roshan's brother sprinkled sugar on the ground outside the temple, reversing the rite of ostracism.It was late at night, two nights later, that the police stationed at Kharkhauda received a report of violence from the village of Peepli Khera.The officer on duty was Subinspector Ankit Chauhan, a babyfaced 28-year-old. Striding down the center lane into the settlement, he noted that there were few men present, only a gaggle of women who had, he deduced, spent the last hours exchanging terms of abuse. He recalls examining ""scratches and bruises,"" nothing serious.Finally, because he saw the necessity for some kind of action, he detained a short, excitable man, one of several who had been named in a complaint from Geeta, a female resident of the village.Chauhan recorded this encounter as a constructive, civil one. Then, satisfied that he had performed his duty, he got back into his service vehicle and left the village.When the sound of the police car had become faint enough, Dharmender and his brothers and his cousins and uncles appeared. Premwati watched them advancing across the village square, some two dozen men closing in. When bricks began to fly, she and her friends ducked inside a house and braced their bodies against the door.Pinki, whose 4-year-old daughter was trapped outside with the crowd, had begun to sob.Geeta had already called the police, and Dharmender saw no further reason to avoid violence.Geeta's husband, Sanjay, was in his undershirt at a neighbor's house, watching a television serial, the children asleep under mosquito nets. When he looked up he saw that the door was blocked by bodies. He recalls the sight of his niece, slumped beside a drain, crying, and a heavy blow to the back of his head, and then nothing.Dharmender felt pity as he beat Geeta's husband: Sanjay was a poor boy, a decent boy. It was not his fault. But the beating was necessary, he said, with a heavy sigh. ""Until someone gets hurt, people don't learn.""Sanjay would spend five days in a hospital bed. On the day Sanjay was discharged, Roshan was lounging with his male relatives on a rope cot outside the temple. He had had to pay Rs 3,000 for Sanjay's medical care and an additional Rs 4,000 to ensure there would be no investigation. But it was worth it.Even Roshan's concession  allowing the women of the village to return to work in the factories  had turned out in his favor. Though the Nat women had headed out almost immediately, nearly all of the factories were now shuttered: China had closed its markets to Indian meat, and Brazil's currency had declined so sharply that its meat was now cheaper than Indian buffalo.So that was that. No one was hiring.Roshan could not help preening a little. ""See, in our community, a woman is a woman and a man is a man,"" he said. ""This is what it is here. Women have lower status and men have higher status."" If any more women propose to challenge that principle, he said, ""we will quietly, politely tell them this is not a good thing.""And that night, as the sun slipped down over the sugar cane, Roshan and the others laughed and laughed."

So the CEO of Ramco Systems, an enterprise cloud software company, set in place a self-penalizing system where he would pay a fine if he was found eating anything with added sugar.""I decided to pay 500 per violation, but set the maximum amount to be paid per day as 1,000,"" says Aggarwal, who introduced the system a couple of years ago. ""Sugar is white poison, and the increase in diabetes globally is ample testimony to the fact. But people have taken it too lightly in India."" So he doesn't consume anything 'white' - whether it is rice, sugar, milk or yogurt.The reason why he launched the initiative is simple. ""Healthy people are more productive, and alert. I believe fitness is extremely important to cope with modern day work pressure,"" says Aggarwal, who works across time zones and takes a minimum of two flights a week. ""If you are not insanely fit, you cannot keep up with the gruelling schedule,"" he says.An increasing number of companies are now urging their employees to eat healthy. While many of them have been focusing on fitness, incorporating gyms into office spaces and offering Zumba classes for employees, several are now stressing on the need to focus on an everyday diet. For it not only keeps the staff healthy and productive, but also helps retain them as it is one way of showing the company cares.At Chargebee Inc., a SaaS-based subscription and recurring billing management company, fruits, nuts and dry fruits are available during the day for company staff. ""We have been serving cut fruits since the last three years,"" says Manikandan Gopi, HR Generalist at Chargebee Inc.Guava, oranges, grapes, bananas, apples, watermelon and other seasonal fruit are served at 11am, and 4pm, when people are most likely to snack on junk food. On Fridays, healthy snack options such as cereal biscuits are provided, all free of cost.Customer support software vendor Freshdesk, on the other hand, has banned canned juices, coke and bottled sodas, providing other options such as sukku coffee, badam milk, and green tea. ""We serve free breakfast, lunch, and dinner and evening snacks and while we can't enforce healthy options, we do provide nutritious alternatives,"" says Girish Mathrubootham, co-founder, Freshdesk.At Ramco Systems, fruits are on the house, and, apart from the regular meal, employees can opt for the Lite meal - a high-protein exotic meal, that includes soup, veg salads, a main course and a healthy serving of fruits. It is also priced similar to the classic meal to encourage employees to opt for a healthier menu and both meals are offered at subsidized prices.Inspired by Aggarwal, some of his employees have adopted the self-penalizing system. ""We have realized that when we do away with sugar, we feel lighter more energetic and it also helps us get rid of fat,"" says Rohit Mathur, 41, vice-president (corporate strategy and business excellence), Ramco Systems.The money collected is distributed to all the coffee boys in office. ""There are about 22 of them and each gets an average of Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 per month. I end up paying Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 every month, as sometimes it is unavoidable,"" says Aggarwal.Dietician Meenakshi Bajaj says many companies approach her to give talks on nutrition, health and wellness. ""They want me to address different sections of people - from those who do hard physical labour to top executives. Companies feel that productivity is dependent on the health of their employees and don't want their staff to end up taking sick leave,"" she says.Bajaj has also designed nutritious meals for in-house cafes of IT companies, and even come up with diabetic menus. ""I tell them what healthy snacks to stock -- multigrain veg sandwich without cheese, veg dosa, low-fat chutneys without coconut,"" she says."

Turmeric can prevent the deadly disease. So can coriander and cinnamon.Dr Bharat B Aggarwal, founder director of the Anti-inflammation Research Institute, San Diego, USA, has a scientific explanation. According to him, curcumin - the active ingredient in turmeric - is effective against cancer.""Spices contain compounds that fight oxidation and inflammation, the two processes underlying most chronic diseases, including cancer,"" said Aggarwal, a former professor of experimental therapeutics, immunology and biochemistry at The University of Texas MD Anderson cancer centre.Turmeric's powerful properties help prevent oxidation and the resulting chronic, low-grade inflammation that trigger or advance many lifestyle diseases.Aggarwal claimed that research had proved that turmeric, taken as supplemental curcumin, was as effective and, in some cases, more effective than pharmaceutical drugs without their side-effects.""Once, my former colleagues and I had compared curcumin with anti-inflammatory and pain-killing medications, as well as with cancer drugs. Curcumin proved to be more effective at reducing inflammation than over-the-counter aspirin and ibuprofen, and as effective as the more powerful drug Celebrex. It also proved as effective in thwarting breast cancer cells as tamoxifen, a drug widely used to stop its spread or recurrence,"" he said.Cut to cinnamon. It can prevent cancer besides managing blood sugar levels and other cardio-vascular disease risk factors. Coriander can help curb colon cancer, while ginger can prevent other forms of the deadly disease.Aggarwal said, ""Cancer is basically a lifestyle disease. Quit smoking and drinking. Avoid stress. Eat fresh vegetables and fruits, maintain the diversity of food and spices in daily diet. When the costs of medicines and healthcare are skyrocketing, simple traditional Indian food and lifestyle can have positive influence on our health. ""He suggested that people should come out of their comfort zone to dodge the deadly disease. ""If you sit back on a sofa and watch TV, you're susceptible to lifestyle diseases, including cancer. Shed some sweat,"" he said.Batting for a shift from pharmaceutical to 'farmaceutical' treatment of cancer, Aggarwal said, ""Promoting farms than pharma companies can go a long way in building a healthy India.""The incidence of breast, colon, or prostate, or even lung cancer - the most common cancers in the western world - is still significantly low in India__about 124.6 people out of 1,00,000 suffer from prostate cancer in the US as against only 4.4 persons in India. ""It is so because Indians consume spices and lead an anti-inflammatory lifestyle,"" Aggarwal said.Known for contributing to inflammation biology and cytokines as regulators of tumour cell growth, Aggarwal vociferously demanded a ban on tobacco to prevent cancer. ""Can you cite a single benefit of tobacco? It has none. Then why it should not be banned?"" asked Aggarwal in the presence ofEarlier, Aggarwal delivered a lecture on ""Targeting Inflammatory Pathways by Spices for Prevention and Therapy of Chronic Diseases"" at the seminar hall in the Institute of Bioinformatics and Biotechnology of Savitribai Phule Pune University.

Records with the Asian Research and Training Institute for Skill Transfer (ARTIST) show the figure for urban Karnataka stands at 15.8%. The prevalence in rural Karantaka is 9% as against 10% in rural India. The DIPSI findings were released at the first Asia Pacific Congress on diabetes, hypertension and metabolic syndrome in pregnancy, held in Sri Lanka last week.""India sees a staggering 3 million cases of gestational diabetes every year. Genetic factors have a role to play. An imprint is left on the pregnant woman when she is in her mother's womb. A similar imprint will be left by her on her child, if her sugar level is not detected and controlled during the pregnancy,"" said Dr Hema Divakar, co-chair, Federation of International Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) and medical director, Divakars Specialty Hospital, who was one of the symposium presidents at the Congress.India fares worst in south AsiaExperts say pregnant women in India are more vulnerable, given that the ethnic population here is at a very high risk. Of the 85 million adult diabetic patients in south Asian countries, 70 million are from India, a World Diabetes Foundation study presented at the Congress said.""A starch and sugar-rich diet, high glycaemic index and lack of exercise are the most important causes of gestational diabetes. Stress and pregnancy hormones are additional factors,"" Dr Divakar pointed out.Doctors say lifestyle disorders, stress and irregular medical check-ups are responsible for increasing the risk of pregnancy-induced diabetes among urban women. ""The solution lies in making lifestyle changes before pregnancy, conducting tests to detect high blood sugar during pregnancy and being able to control the sugar level during and after pregnancy. This will not only keep expectant mothers, even those over 40, healthy but also ensure the foetus is nurtured in the normal sugar environment of the mother,"" she explained.Story 2: Depression common among diabetics: StudyDiabetes patients in developing countries should undergo routine screening for depression symptoms, according to findings of the International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS). The data was released at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Munich this month.IDMPS, the largest observational study of adults with diabetes in developing countries, revealed that diabetes, like any chronic condition, is associated with a higher risk of depression. A large number of people with Type 1 Diabetes (30.7%) and Type 2 Diabetes (up to 46%) reported mild to severe depression symptoms.

Various outfits working for the welfare of peasants from half a dozen states are participating in the two-day workshop. It apprised about the precarious condition of small and marginal farmers across the country.Professor Sucha Singh Gill, economist at Chandigarh-based Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), raised concern over rising suicides by farmers and farm workers across the country. He said, ""Rising suicides are a pointer of agrarian crisis going deeper across the country. The policies for farming are not congenial for small farmers as they are even failing to recover their input costs.""Prof Gill advocated farmer-friendly policies to put a stop to suicides and peasants turning into labourers. He also stressed on the need to promote cooperative farming for small farmers and to provide substantial subsidies for seeds, fertilizers and machinery.Experts and resources at the workshop also observed that a cut in agriculture subsidies and disbanding of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) could further deepen the agrarian crisis which would lead to more suicides.Prof Sukhpal Singh, head of economics at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, termed the crop insurance scheme faulty. He said, ""The scheme will not help farmers, but will be beneficial for insurance companies.""Karnataka-based Farmer Struggle Committee said the situation of their small and marginal farmers was even worse than those in Punjab. It said Mandya district of Karnataka, known to be a prosperous district, saw 100 farmer suicides in 2015. Most of those farmers were into sugarcane, cotton, tobacco and mulberry cultivation.Farmer Struggle Committee's Mandya convener Vasu H V said, ""Mandya is known for its sugar factories, but despite that the condition of small and marginal farmers into sugarcane cultivation is grim. Thousands of farmers are leaving farming every year and the trend has been continuing for the last 15 years. Most of these have turned into farm labourers. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi lowered the import duty on silk worms while visiting China last year, the farmers are facing hardships after the price of silk worm came down sharply. Institutional loans are not available for small farmers and cost of education and healthcare facilities have gone up in the last few years.""Partha Sarkar, who works for Grameen Mazdoor Union in Patna, said successive crop failures and drought-like situation in the past years have increased incidence of farm suicides in Bihar. Besides, a large number of small and marginal farmers are being pushed out of farming."" He said that according to a study conducted in December 2014 by Delhi-based Institute of Human Development, thousands of peasants were quitting farming and starting to work as wage labourers.Social activist Madhuri from Badwani in Madhya Pradesh said small farmers in tribal areas of the state were worst hit due to corporatization of farming and wrong policies of successive Union and state governments.""The policy of corporatization is sacrificing jobs of small farmers and turning them bonded labourers. Agrarian crisis is building by the day."" Avik Shah of Jai Kisan Abhiyan in West Bengal apprised about problems being faced by farmers in Bengal."

They said government's has intention to sell off the sugar mill to private entrepreneurs.JKS state president H N Deepak accused that Mysugar mill, which was established by Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar of Mysuru Wodeyar dynasty, has been in the grip of corrupt politicians and officers who are squeezing out money from the mill. ""Once Mysugar mill was a prosperous industry owned by state government. Now, this factory has been gasping for survival with staggering debt of more than Rs 500 crore. It should be a shame to our politicians to make this industry sick and let it dying. Is this is the way our politicians show respect to our visionary ruler Nalvadi Krishnaraja wodeyar,"" Deepak said.Protesters warned that the state government should revive the mill and if no actions are taken, JKS should launch more agitations in Mysuru region.They said they don't want Mysugar mill, an eternal gift of Wodeyar dynasty, to be added to history book.The protest by JKS activists, which was supported by Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha, affected the vehicular traffic on Mysuru-Bengaluru highway for hours. The vehicular traffic came to standstill as vehicles were piled up on both the sides of the highway."

This has been possible partially by the use of a newly released variety of sugarcane, Co0238, that has been developed by a team of scientists led by Bakshi Ram, director of Sugarcane Breeding Research Institute in Coimbatore . This variety is increasingly gaining popularity in the state.Ram, who had come to premier National Sugar Institute (NSI) in the city to take part in an international symposium, said ""Though Co0238 was developed for sub-tropical regions of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, it has shown results better than the older variety -- Co86032 -- which is prominent in tropical regions of Karnataka and Mahrashtra."" He added that with the introduction of the new variety in 2012-13, the average yield of sugarcane in UP increased from 60 tonnes per hectare to 66.5 tonnes per hectare in 2015-16.""In UP there is a persisting problem of low sugarcane productivity as indicated by lower yields as well as lower sugar content in sugarcane. Here, this variety can work wonders,"" he claimed.Besides Ram, a number of experts in sugar industry from the US, UK and Australia also took part in the symposium 'Opportunities and challenges from the emerging bio-economy for the sugar sector', held here on Saturday. They discussed means to be adopted for sustainability of the sugar industry across the globe with focus on the Indian sugar producing industry. The experts stated that there is a need to switch over to newer technologies for producing sugar."

Church grounds are being prepared to accommodate the faithful who attend the services.The interpretations of Easter may be varied and each church in Navi Mumbai giving a different message to its community. But, for most, Lent translates into forty days of penance and prayer, of sacrifices and a spiritual sojourn.Many gave up alcohol, smoking and even eating meat; others did not indulge in chocolate or ice cream or any favourite food. While Easter eggs, sugar bunnies and a festive Easter lunch mark the celebrations of the season, many also introspect the spiritual side of the season.Spiritually, the community looks at life from a different perspective during these forty days. Each season, the church urges its flock to reflect on an aspect important to one's life.Father Louis Kajar, parish priest of Divya Kripa Church in Kharghar, said that they emphasized on the virtue of being humble this year. ""Leave your disbelief behind and believe in the resurrection of Christ,"" he added.The parishioners of Our Lady of the Forsaken in Ghansoli and Sacred Heart Church in Vashi were asked to reflect on the theme of mercy.""Since this is the Year of Mercy, we are focussing on being merciful towards ourselves and others,"" said Father Ashil Joseph.Father Baptist from Sacred Heart Church added that although each day has an individual reflection, this season, mercy was the main theme."

It said that sugar prices are in a better position, hence, there is no need for the subsidy. Mills have expressed their disappointment over the decision.Sugar prices, which were hovering around Rs 19,000 per tonne in the wholesale market in December 2015 , have now sincreased to Rs 35,000 per tonne. The Centre pointed out that in such situation, there is no need to disburse the subsidy to the farmers since the mills can make the payment.P G Medhe, consultant to Chhatrapati Rajaram Cooperative Sugar Mill in Kolhapur, said, ""This is a major setback for mills. We were a bit relieved when our burden was partially shared by the government. The withdrawal of this decision will mean that mills will be suspicious about the Centre's every move. The excess supply of sugar in the country has already put a lot of pressure on the mills. There is no guarantee of good returns on current stock of produced sugar, and in such a situation, the government's subsidy of Rs 45 per tonne support to the farmers was a boost. Now, it is the mills' responsibility to make payment.""Raju Shetti, farmers' leader and member of parliament, said, ""This means that mills will have to sell their sugar at the current market prices so that they can make payment to farmers. Mills were already pressurised by the state machinery to make payment to the farmers. Some mills have also faced suspension of their crushing licence. The new twist will put more pressure on mills and they will be forced to sell sugar, which will keep retail prices under check.""The Centre's production subsidy had come as an offset for mills which were stressing on their inability to pay sugarcane purchase price as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP) formula. ""The subsidy shall be paid directly to farmers on behalf of the mills and be adjusted against the cane price payable to the farmers towards FRP including arrears for previous years. Subsequent balance, if any, shall be credited into the mill's account. Priority will be given to settling cane arrears of the previous years,"" read the official release after the cabinet committee of economic affairs had taken the decision. The idea was to clear old dues so that sugar mills will be eligible for fresh loans for the next crushing season."

The grandeur of the arrangements, courtesy poll strategist Prashant Kishor and his team, the afternoon downpour, the temporarily failed microphones, the dash for cover by the audiences, taking of refuge under plastic chairs, and finally, the arduous two-hour wait for Rahul Gandhi, soaked to the bone. And if only for a few moments, some of the 'behaali' may have been reflected in the scenes on the stage.It was a test of patience, too. But Congress proved on Friday it's not called the Grand Old Party without reason. They may have been in the political wilderness for some years, but the will to be out in the rough and tumble of politics, Friday's show proved, is still alive. And so, no sooner than Rahul Gandhi took centre stage to answer workers' queries than Ghulam Nabi Azad took a break to air and dry his wet socks, while CM face Sheila Dikshit wrapped the 'palla' of her sari around her head to shield herself from rains. Campaign manager Sanjay Sinh, who may not remember when he last held a microphone and addressed a gathering this large (Congress claimed there were above 40,000 people), attempted to respond to how the Congress would protect the interest of sugar cane farmers in UP. A clear answer never emerged, but it may at least serve as a ""mike testing"" attempt after a two decade gap.While Kishor would have had reason to celebrate on Friday, the rainy afternoon event was unable to metamorphose the Congress scion into the Rockstar Rahul as appeared to have been planned. The stage, prepared in the hope that the programme would extend well after the sun sets, was to light up Rahul - and, hopefully, the Congress poll fortunes in UP - in bright tungsten lights. That, though, was not to be. The 50-questions and answer session was wrapped up in under two hours, and Rahul's final words were even more crisp - wrapping up the event at 5pm, with the sun still up.Finally, it was the proverbial case of all's well that ends well. The 100 metre ramps on either side of the stage saw Congress put up a show of strength - its 120-member strong team extended from left ramp to right ramp and led to compere Rita Joshi asking the leaders to vacate the stage because it was ""weak"".And, though many workers left the venue when the rains started, the traffic jam outside the rally grounds, the worker with the screen printed image of RaGa on his belly, and the kilos of 'amritsari kulchas' and tubs of ice creams sold were enough proof for the naysayers that the Congress is back in the reckoning in poll-bound UP."

Data tabled in the state assembly shows that in the last two years jail authorities recovered 61 mobile phones along with batteries, chargers and sim cards from inside Sabarmati jail premises. Also, Rs 1.58 lakh cash was recovered in the last two years, along with dangerous items like iron rods, scissors, and razors from various barracks of the jail.Replying to a question by Jhalod MLA Mitesh Garasia, minister of state for home, Rajanikant Patel, said that apart from mobiles, the police have also recovered cigarette packets, scissors, iron roads, razor, gutka, sugar and tea among other items. Police also recovered garlic chutney, onions, potatoes and edible oil.The government's reply stated that departmental inquiry has been initiated against 88 jail officials, and 236 prisoners from whose barracks these prohibited items were recovered.Patel said that in 2014, some 29 phones were recovered from the jail, while in 2015 the number increased to 32. Also, the cash recovered from inside jail was Rs88,850 in 2014 and Rs69,500 in 2015.From Dahod sub-jail, only three mobiles, one charger and one sim card was recovered. It is worth recalling that recently a mobile was recovered from the cell of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti convener, Hardik Patel, who is lodged in Surat jail.Not long ago, in December 2013, jail authorities had discovered a 213-ft-long tunnel dug by accused in the serial blast case. The recovery of such equipment once again from inside jail premises raises serious security concerns, when the government claims CCTV and cell phone signal jammers have been installed in prisons."

""We have conducted a vote with a raising of the hands. Out of 18,000 members, 700-800 members were present for the SGM. The meeting happened in the most transparent way,"" said Darekar. Only 25 members are required to make quorum, so Wednesday's turn-out showed a large uptick of interest in the bank's activities. Darekar added, ""If any member has doubts or queries we have formed a committee compromising five members that they can approach for information.""This effort to build in transparency about the massive write-off on the bank's non-performing assets could be seen as too little, too late, after the confidential report exclusively accessed by this paper, by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) stated in no uncertain terms, ""The methods of operations of the bank cannot be construed as not detrimental to the interest of present or future depositors."" Sixty per cent of these depositors are housing societies, which, will indirectly be paying for the write-off.Vivekanand Gupta, Advocate Secretary BJP Mumbai has called today's bank decision illegal. Gupta said, ""Public money is being siphoned off by those very people who were its custodian. There is huge corruption in Mumbai Bank and thus I had filed FIR with EOW on 27 March 2015, investigation is in progress and i have been following the matter. The loan to sugar factories was illegal and outside the jurisdiction of Mumbai Bank.""Mumbai Bank is the main financing agency of all affiliated co-operative societies in Mumbai district.Most of its current 19 directors are politicians, including Shiv Sena MLA Sunil Raut, BJP leaders Shivaji Nalavade and Kavita Deshmukh, Congress' Sandeep Ghanvat, and NCP's Jijaba Pawar and Siddharth Kamble, which is why the proposal has been perceived as a as a waiver for politicians by politicians.The bank claims that by passing this proposal, it will be cleansed of its non-performing assets (NPAs) and can begin with a clean slate.However, as the October 2015 the NABARD report has noted, writing off loans in the past has not decreased the bank's bad debt. ""During the 2013-14, the principal amount written off for 35 societies amounted to Rs 158.09 lakh and Interest amount written off was Rs 1616.70 lakh. Further, during the year 2014-15 the written off amount for 87 defaulting societies was Rs 1253.65 lakh under principal and interest Rs 1042.73 lakh as interest.""Also, there were discrepancies in the formula used for declaring NPAs, which has yielded undue benefits to various fraudulent entities. ""[The formula] in the software was wrong in respect of bogus housing loans sanctioned and frauds in gold loan and also shortfall amount after auctioning the gold,"" the report stated.Borrowing for house or house repair spiralled up dramatically - a the end of March 2013 it stood at Rs12,603 lakh and in two years, it had more than doubled to Rs 27275 lakh. While some are legitimate, the NABARD report found at least 41instances where these housing loans were fake (29 cases in Kurla, 3 in Vikhroli East and 9 in Bhandup West) even though it hadn't been able to undertake a review of all the branches.Wednesday's vote also lets 91 individual defaulters, with over Rs 58 lakh in debts off the hook.Two urban cooperative banks also no longer have to account for their borrowings of over Rs 2,53 cr.Sources from Deputy Registrar of Mumbai District Cooperative office told Mumbai Mirror, ""By next week we are initiating action on the NABARD report."""

If sowing pattern of summer crop is any indication, prices of sugar are likely to rocket. Already sugar prices are on a high - Rs 40 per kg. State agriculture department officials say that sugar cane cultivation in Gujarat is at its lowest in the last 10 years. ""This year Gujarat's farmers are sowing sugar cane in only 3% of the total land cultivated for the crop in the last decade. Earlier, sugar cane crops used to cover 1.06 lakh hectares which has now dropped to 3,200 hectares. Even last year the crop was sowed in 1.06 lakh hectares,"" said a state agriculture department official.Agriculture department officials said: ""after sugar cane, sesame had the second lowest sowing of only 19%. As against the sowing over 67,100 hectares, the sowing this year was only in 13,000 hectares.""Gujarat's water scarcity is a major contributor in this dip in agricultural activity. With the state government putting a complete ban on release of water for irrigation, agricultural activity has been witnessed only in 7.58 lakh hectares which is 69% of the normal sowing area of 11.07 lakh hectares. Among all the crops being sown this year, fodder is on the top of the list having covered the maximum cultivated area. According to the data released by the state agriculture department, sowing of Adad pulses has registered a substantial increase. Earlier this crop was sown in 1,700 hectares, this time it spans 9,000 hectares - an increase of 429%. Onion crop sowing area too has registered a jump of 46%.""Sowing of onion usually takes place over 7,400 hectares but this year the sowing is in 10,800 hectares,"" said an agriculture department official. Barring paddy and onion sowing of other crops has been less than the usual. According to data released, the maximum agricultural activity was registered in north Gujarat region (3.67 lakh hectares) followed by central Gujarat (17,900 hectares). In Saurashtra, where there is hardly any water in dams, sowing has been carried out in 10,800 hectares."

Interestingly, scrips of leading sugar companies touched their 52-week high only on June 13.Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals Ltd and Rana Sugars Ltd led the list of gainers with their scrips surging 19.2% and 19.9% respectively.

While the Bajaj Hindusthan stock has more than doubled from its yearly low hit on August 25, the Simbhaoli Sugars scrip has trebled in value from its 52-week low touched on September 29.With the government notifying mandatory exports, sugar prices started improving  from 25,500 per tonne in September last year to around 37,500 per tonne now. Sugar prices stood at nearly 35,500 per tonne in May. Prices have been on a strong uptrend in anticipation of stock clearance backed by exports and lower production in Maharashtra, the largest producer of the commodity.Surplus domestic production and limited exports resulted in a steep decline in sugar prices, which hit a three-year low of 23,000 per tonne in July last year. This prompted the Centre to notify minimum indicative export quota (MIEQ) for sugar mills to export 4 million tonnes of sugar during the 2015-16 season (October-September)."

Most Rozedar prefer Irani and Iraqi dates, which range between Rs. 70-120 per kg while some choose the premium kalmi that comes for Rs. 600 to Rs. 900 per kg, said retailer Swaleh, displaying an array of the fruit at his store in Dalmandi. The kemia variety stock sells for Rs. 150-200 per kg while the high-end ajwa, known as King of dates, can cost up to Rs 2,200. It is the most prized of them all in terms of taste, flavour and price, he added.Swaleh further said that it is also tradition to open the roza with one or two dates at the iftar (evening) time, as the Prophet Muhammad used to do so. ""Prophet had recommended Muslims to break fast during Ramzan (iftar) with dates. Dates are an excellent source of fiber, sugar and have carbohydrates that maintains health,"" said Swaleh's father.The markets are flooded with varieties of dates from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Middle East and other countries. The packaged dates like Tammi Tammi from Tunisia also attract buyers who prefer these dates as gifts for friends and relatives, informed Swaleh, adding that despite a 30-40% rise in cost of dates, the demand has remained unchanged.Another shopkeeper Sameer Khan had stocked more than 15-20 varieties of dates owing to the increased demands. ""Apart from the regular buyers, many Rozedars purchase dates in a large amount as they start their fast by consuming only four dates and a glass of milk during Sehri (morning). This is called Sunnat ie. following principles of Prophet Mohammad,"" said Khan.Besides, dates are also flying off the shelves in shops at Madanpura, Golghar, Orderly Bazar, Pathani Tola as well as prominent Visheshwarganj market."

Patil is likely to file an election petition against Mahajan for violation of the Representation of People Act.Patil lost the 2014 assembly polls from Jamner to Mahajan, who has represented the seat since 1995. Mahajan polled 1.03 lakh votes while Patil managed 67,730.In his letter to the ec, Patil submitted that despite Mahajan owning five acres of land in Manpur village of Jamner since 2002, he did not disclose it before the Jalgaon collector, who was the returning officer.""As per the provisions of the Representation of People Act, it is binding on all contesting candidates to disclose movable and immovable property before the returning officer. In fact, they have to submit the information on oath. In case of Mahajan, it was found that he failed to submit information on ownership of land,"" Patil said in his three-page complaint to the EC and Jalgaon Collector.Patil said that since Mahajan is an influential politician and a cabinet member, the possibility of destroying crucial documents could not be ruled out and the Jalgaon police should immediately register an offence against him for violation of the Representation of People Act.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik demanded Mahajan's dismissal from the cabinet for his alleged involvement in a land scam. ""Prima facie, it appears that Mahajan has misled farmers. They were told that the land is being acquired for a cooperative sugar factory and they will be offered jobs. A decade and half later, neither the sugar factory has been set up nor have jobs given to farmers whose land was acquired,"" Malik said."

""Drought-hit Maharastra has led to an overall poor produce leading to exorbitant rates of pulses. For the past one week, even the prices in Goa have been high,"" said vendor Gunaji Dhulapkar.The Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2015-16 has reportedly indicated that the production of cereals is projected to fall 41%, and pulses 11%, as agricultural growth in Maharashtra declined by 2.7% for the year 2015-16.""Since most of these legumes have to be brought from Maharashtra, Goa's dependency on the drought-hit state will affect our business badly this year,"" said another vendor Aarti Amonkar.While businesspersons in the local market are putting on a brave face for now, they feel sceptical of the scenario as the month of Shravan, a time when these pulses are most in demand, is fast-approaching.""We will definitely feel the hit once Shravan commences, especially for toor dal which is sourced from the Latur district in Maharashtra,"" said vendor Nitin Mandrekar.He further added that besides various pulse crops being affected, even sugarcane crops were a disappointment as a result of which there will likely be a crunch for sugar as well."

We have using all forms of media for spreading awareness about the reason behind tree plantation. We have created a database of people who are keen to participate in the drive. Many social organisations, NGOs, youth groups, schools, and local establishments in rural areas have participated in it. We have informed them about recognised nurseries, what type of saplings should be planted, and the scientific methods of doing it.""While Kolhapur district has created 6,49,140 pits, it is followed by Satara (7,54,018), Sangli (5,02,420), Ratnagiri (1,69,453) and Sindhudurg (1,18,021).

Out of the 2 crore sapling, the forest department will plant up to 1.5 lakh, while the other departments will plant the remaining 50 lakh trees.The government resolution also says that the cooperation, textiles and marketing departments should plant trees in the vicinity of their offices, sugar factories, textile industries and small scale industries.

58f1d38ea3d24b245e59d191,Maharashtra likely to see 30% drop in sugar output,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Maharashtra-likely-to-see-30-drop-in-sugar-output/articleshow/51961757.cms,2016-04-24,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra, which has long been the top sugar producer in the country, is likely to see a steep decline in its sugar output-of around 30%-on account of the intense drought, according to estimates from sugar department officials. Early forecasts suggest that sugar production in Maharashtra will drop from 85 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to just around 55-60 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. A decline which ranges from 29% to 35%, officials say. The state's federation of cooperative sugar factories places the decline slightly lower, expecting an output of between 62 lakh and 67 lakh tonnes.The sugarcane planting season stretches from June to February. Typically around 6 lakh hectares of new cane is grown during these months. However, the season of 2015-16 saw a plantation of less than 3 lakh hectares, officials say. A final estimate of the crop area can only be made by June. Besides the new plantation, the old sugarcane stumps also grow out by then. These usually account for 45% of the total crop.""It is premature to estimate the crop area. It will depend on the survival of the ratoon or the cane which grows from old stumps. We are hoping for pre-seasonal showers,"" said state sugar commissioner Vipin Sharma.The steepest decline in cane area has been in the Marathwada region, which was worst hit by the drought. Despite being a historically arid region, Marathwada cultivates as much as 20% of the water-guzzling crop and has 70 sugar factories. The parched district of Solapur in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra also reported a major drop in cane area, besides Pune and Ahmednagar.In 2014-15, which was a drought year, the state saw its highest ever sugar production at 105 lakh tonnes. In 2015-16, it fell to 85 lakh tonnes. Now it is set to plummet even further.Maharashtra has 236 sugar factories, of which 177 functioned this year, officials say. ""Sugar factories will face heavy losses with the fall in cane. Some will face closures and lay-offs,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra cooperative sugar factories federation.The state's sugar factories also owe farmers massive dues worth Rs 3,200 crore. ""The state's factories have paid 80% of farmers' dues, and the rest should be cleared by September,"" Babar said.Critics are increasingly questioning the wisdom of cane cultivation in drought-prone Marathwada and calling for a ban. ""There is a 101% cause-effect between sugarcane cultivation in Marathwada and the drought. The region is part of a deficit river basin and cannot afford to cultivate a water-intensive crop,"" said water expert Pradeep Purandare, former expert member of the Marathwada Development Board.Latur, which is facing its most intense water crisis, cultivates the largest amount of cane in Marathwada. ""It takes 2,500 litres of water to irrigate one kilogram of sugar. On an average, a factory that can crush 2,500 tonnes of cane a day needs 25,00,000 litres of water a day,"" he said. Yet, instead of cutting back on cane, Marathwada has only increased its cane cultivation and sugar factories, adding to the water stress and draining ground water."
58f1d52ba3d24b245e59d218,"IPL is serious business, not the tamasha it seems",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/ipl/news/IPL-is-serious-business-not-the-tamasha-it-seems/articleshow/51963877.cms,2016-04-24,"Quick! What's the one word associated with IPL? Cricket?Wrong. The word is tamasha.That's so in the popular imagination, and it's obviously so in the minds of our higher judiciary .Why else would the Bombay high court order all IPL matches to be moved out of Maharashtra at the end of April?By now, all of us realize that the phrase `judicial overreach' is a purely Indian formulation: read the newspapers of other countries and you hardly ever come across these words. From ruling on deaths on railway tracks, to asking banks to give confidential information about defaulters, to banning cricket matches, our courts often take on the role of the executive, ie the government. If our Constitution wanted a firm demarcation wanted a firm demarcation between the roles of the First, Second and Third Estates, the judiciary seems to cross these lines with impunity.But leave that aside for the moment. What should concern us is the attitude behind the IPL ban and why, faced with the acute water scarcity in many parts of Maharashtra, the high court singled out the T20 tournament for its attention. Just a few weeks earlier, the World T20 Cup took place in India with a number of matches in Maharashtra. Was water not used for the grounds then? What about the extensive lawns of Raj Bhavan, the city's golf courses, the grounds of Mumbai`s many private clubs? Did the courts pass strictures on them? Why didn't the court order the closure of all swimming pools -municipal, club and housing societies? They consume a lot of water for a low-priority activity. Have water cuts been imposed on industries and housing societies?And since the judiciary is taking on the role of the executive, why not look at an even bigger issue, that of Maharashtra's sugarcane plantations? Sugarcane is a water-guzzling crop and in Maharashtra its cultivation is considered to be the principal reason for the severe drought because over 70% of irrigation water is consumed by sugarcane. Here's a simple statistic: it needs just over 2,000 litres of water to produce 1kg of sugar, which means 20 lakh litres to produce 1 tonne. The estimated water usage for all the 20 IPL matches in Maharashtra is 60 lakh litres. That's three tonnes of sugar. Maharashtra produces in excess of 100 lakh tonnes of sugar per year. You do the math which the high court didn't do. If, like the high court, you want to usurp the role of the executive, you might as well do it thoroughly and go to the root causes of the problem.Instead of that, you pick the easiest target. The question is why. Why is IPL on the radar of the judiciary, apoplectic TV anchors and sundry PIL litigants. It's that one word, tamasha. Yet that's such a superficial criticism, based on the tournament's surface razzmatazz -the silly cheerleaders, the loud countdowns, the flares shot into the sky, the blaring trumpets. All this leads (subconsciously no doubt) to a kind of self-righteous in dignation that people in the stadium are having too much fun. Perhaps they are. Of course they are. But why should they not?The prime reason the IPL is so successful and each stadium is packed to capacity is because the action in the middle is deadly serious. The 13 cricketers in the middle of these steaming cauldrons are like gladiators engaged are like gladiators engaged in deadly battle. Bowlers are being battered, batsmen are feeling the pressure of not doing enough, fielders are flinging themselves on the field as if each run means life and death.But IPL goes beyond just the matches being played. It has brought life back into the dying game of cricket. We who know cricket, do know that Test matches are the real thing, but we also know that Test cricket itself has changed because of the shorter forms of the game: scoring rates have shot up, fielding standards are such that there are no weak fielders. IPL has also given young cricketers incredible opportunities -to show off their skills on the large stage, to play together (and learn from) international cricketers and legends of the game and get the kind of financial security, and sometimes fortunes -that they couldn't even dream about a few years ago.It doesn't stop there: the success of India's premier cricket league has sparked interest in other games. Suddenly there is an Indian badminton league, a tennis league, and leagues in hockey, football, even kabaddi! Suddenly, for the young boy and girl with talent, whether in a large town or small, the dream of a sporting career doesn't have to be sacrificed at the altar of the textbook. Here, at last, is the possibility of a national sporting culture. And all because of IPL. Tamasha? You must be joking."

The consumer food price index increased 6.3% in April from the previous month's 5.2%. Price of pulses surged 34.1% in April, while sugar and confectionary rose 11.2% year-on-year during the month. Retail inflation in rural areas rose 6%, while in urban areas it grew 4.7%.Economists said they expect the RBI to hold rates. According to them, monsoon holds the key to the inflation trajectory in the months ahead. ""The drought-like conditions in several districts are unlikely to allow a respite in food inflation until monsoon rains cover a significant portion of the country. Notwithstanding the dismal performance of manufacturing in March 2016, the uptick in headline as well as core CPI inflation in April 2016 have reduced the likelihood of a rate cut in the upcoming policy, unless the monsoon delivers a positive surprise,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ratings agency ICRA.Separate data showed industrial output growth slowed to 0.1% in March from previous month's 2% expansion. Industrial growth had rebounded in February after three consecutive months of contraction. Industrial growth for 2015-16 was 2.4% year-on-year compared to 2.8% in 2014-15.The performance of the industrial sector was dragged down by a decline in the mining and manufacturing sectors. The electricity sector was the bright spot, which rose 11.3% in March compared to 2% in the same month last year. The decline in the mining sector was the first since June 2015.The capital goods sector, a key gauge of industrial activity, fell 15.4% in March compared to an expansion of 9.1% in the year-ago period. This sector has remained volatile for a significant period.Consumer durables posted robust growth of 8.7% in March compared to a contraction of 4.7% in March 2015, while the consumer non-durables sector fell 4.4% during the month compared to a growth of 1.9% during the corresponding period of last year.Economists said they expect a turnaround in the months ahead. ""The lagged impact of interest rate reductions, salary revisions and easier monetary conditions will also support demand and boost industrial capacity utilization,"" ratings agency Crisil said in a note. ""We expect GDP to rise to 7.9% in fiscal 2017 from 7.6% in fiscal 2016 and industry GDP to grow at 7.6% driven by manufacturing and construction activity,"" the agency said."

The lineman would shoulder the responsibility of fulfilling the need of that particular village,"" Bawankule said while inaugurating a sub-station at Koregaon in Walwa taluka of Sangli district on Thursday.Around 70,000 linemen work with the Maharashtra state electricity distribution company. The government is planning to set up a panel of 10 to 12 workers for a set of three villages, he said.Bawankule said he has started a state-wide tour to study the issues related to his ministry. ""I have learned that Sangli requires Rs 140 crore to provide electricity to 8,000 agriculture consumers and 10,000 domestic consumers. The funds will be provided soon. As per the state policy, we are separating domestic feeders from the agriculture feeders at 400 places in Sangli at a cost of Rs 50 crore. This will help the company provide 24x7 electricity in the rural areas,"" he said.The government has increased the purchase cost of power generated by sugar factories by 10%, the minister said. He appealed to the local people to set up a biomass plant with the help of the power department and the government.Referring to reports that as many as 1,500 people were electrocuted in the state in 2015, the minister said the responsibility of safe electricity lies with the electricity companies. ""I have asked the companies not to entertain illegalities in their operations. There were cases in which a wireman assigning his deputy on his own. That is not allowed. I have also asked the employees of above 50 years of age to take voluntary retirement if they are incapable of doing repair works on electricity poles. We will allow their kin to join the company,"" he said."

This year, Maha Shivaratri has special significance as it falls on a Monday and is celebrated during the ongoing 'Sinhastha Kumbh' period in Nashik.Dr Satyapriya Shukla, priest at the temple, said, ""The Maha Shivaratri coming on Monday is a rare coincidence. Earlier, the same had happened in 2012. However, the coincidence will be repeated next after 12 years in 2028. Devotees are finding it a rare moment and would arrive to seek blessings of Lord Shiva.""On Maha Shivaratri, Lord Shiva is worshipped as the deity of dissolution. Only cold water and leaves of Bael are offered to Lord Shiva. Other traditional offerings, such as bathing it in milk and Panchamruta (a mixture of milk, curds, ghee, sugar and honey) or anointing it with white consecrated rice (Akshata) are not made on this day.The Maha Shivaratri will start at 1.20pm on Monday and will continue till 10.33am on Tuesday. Trustees of Trimbakeshwar temple said more than 5 lakh devotees are expected to visit the temple in the 48 hours of Maha Shivaratri.""Maha Shivaratri is the biggest festival of Trimbakeshwar temple. We receive about 3 lakh devotees every year on this day.

Local priests said more than 3,000 families have registered for the 'Kalsarpa Pooja' on Monday.Mythologically, the Shivaratri (night of Shiva) is considered as the night of celebration of marriage of Shiva and Parvati. According to astrology, there is no need to search for Muhurat for tying nuptial knot on this night.

This period will have around 40 auspicious occasions, which will see the gathering of devotees at Ram Kund and Kushavarta. These are called 'Parva Snan' and not Shahi snan as sadhus wouldn't be a part of these baths. But the importance of these dates is no less than the Shahi Parvanis. Taking a holy dip on Maha Shivaratri is considered as the most blissful in Sinhastha Parva,"" said Madhukar Dixit, senior astrologer in Nashik.250 special MSRTC buses arrangedThe Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation has arranged 250 special buses to tackle the rush of devotees visiting Trimbakeshwar on Monday.

Patil has decided to support Paricharak though he does not have too many followers there.Prashant is an MLC from the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana, a BJP ally, and is leading the Parivartan Aghadi, a panel of candidates against Mahadik's panel.Five years ago, Mahadik had joined hands with then MLC from Pandharpur Bharat Bhalke to snatch power from the Paricharak panel. Now, they are facing the challenge from Paricharak again.Satej Patil and Dhananjay Mahadik were together in Kolhapur politics, with Dhananjay's uncle Mahadevrao being an influential leader in the district. Their fallout resulted in Mahadik and Patil factions getting involved in counter-politics at every occasion such as elections to the zilla parishad, municipal corporation, Lok Sabha and assembly.Despite Patil's opposition, the Congress leaders had asked him to support Dhananjay Mahadik for his Lok Sabha elections. Though Mahadik won the election, the Congress' nationwide defeat changed the equations at the state level. The NCP also changed its stand and the Mahadiks saw an opportunity to settle score with Patil.Amal Mahadev Mahadik, then member of the zilla parishad was supposed to be the chairman, but Patil opposed him and appointed another member of the ZP. Consequently, Mahadevro Mahadik let Amal join the BJP and defeat Patil in the 2014 assembly elections. From the beginning of 2015, there were elections to the Gokul dairy, Kolhapur district central cooperative bank and the Chhtrapati Rajaram cooperative sugar factory ltd, which is controlled by Mahadik. Except at KDCC, Patil gave a tough fight to the Mahadiks, followed by major success in Kolhapur Municipal Corporation elections, where the Congress emerged the single-largest party. It helped Patil get Congress ticket for the MLC elections and defeat Mahadevrao Mahadik in December last year.Patil said, ""I am taking side of a good group, which is working for the betterment of the factory. These people are good and know how to run a factory. I will be supporting them. The selection of candidates from various categories was solely decided by the panel as they are local residents and are well aware of running the factory.""Meanwhile, Mahadik said, ""As far as I know, Patil hardly has any contacts here. He may be visiting the leaders who are contesting against my panel, but I have doubts about his role in influencing the voting. My voters are sugarcane cultivators and I have been in touch with them constantly, so I do not think there will be any problem for me."""

Officials said the doctor had paid money to cover up a botched weight-loss surgery.Dr M Maran of Bharathi raja Hospital surrendered his medical licence to the council earlier this week and his name was formally struck of the medical register. The decision was taken based on a complaint from the patient's husband N Gowrishankar, a resident of Kodambakkam, who said his 35-year-old wife Amudha died in May 2015 because the surgery done in November, 2014 went horribly wrong. After inquiry, the council's disciplinary committee recommended action against the doctor and the general body and the executive committee ratified it.""We found that it was a case of ethics violation because the surgeon admitted that he had paid `5 lakh to the patient's kin. We think this bribery is unacceptable,"" said the council's former president P Balakrishnan, who passed the orders on February 15.On November 11, 2014, Amudha, who was morbidly obese with uncontrolled sugar and blood pressure, underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy , a minimally invasive standard weight loss surgery . Her surgeon, Dr Maran, reduced the size of her stomach so that she would be forced to eat less.She was discharged after a week, but returned with similar complaints a week later. This time doctors cut open her abdomen and placed a ""wired sponge"" to absorb fluid that had leaked.Apollo Hospitals surgical gastroenterologist Dr R Surendran had noted on the patient's case sheet that she complained of chest and abdomen pain and breathlessness after the weight loss surgery .Dr Maran told the medical council that he had not botched up the surgery but had transferred Rs 5 lakh to Gowrishankar's bank account to fund his wife's treatment at Apollo Hospitals. On Thursday, Dr Maran told the TOI that medical details were misinterpreted by the patient's relatives and the medical council. ""The sponge was deliberately left in the abdomen to absorb the fluid. It was mistaken as negligence. It is sad that complications arose but it was not because of a botch-up. I will be appealing against the council's decision,"" he said."

As many as 1,103 houses, three minor and five major cattle sheds have been damaged. A pair of bullocks was also lost in the deluge.Five deaths have been reported so far, of which one was claimed by lightning. Another was drowned while the remaining three died due after a house wall collapsed on them. Three of the deaths occurred in the first week of July.Of the total houses, eight of them are completely damaged. The estimated losses so far stands at Rs 2.15 crore across the district. Whereas, the estimated loss of the cattle sheds calculated is Rs 2.8 lakh. The crop losses are not yet calculated as the fields are still inaccessible. The gross final figure losses would increase further.Carrying out the damage assessment in many villages, especially the ones close to rivers will be time-consuming for district revenue officers as the water is still clogged in some fields under sugarcane plantation. Hence, the officials are still not able to operate in those fields.There are eight weirs in the district, which are still submerged under Panchganga and Bhogawati rivers.District collector Amit Saini said, ""The sugarcane fields in some tehsils, close to river bank are still under water. They are partially submerged, but these fields are inaccessible. Unless the water recedes, our staff cannot assess the fields and calculate the intensity of damages.""Farmers, however, are currently relieved. First, the monsoon has been satisfactory across the district supporting sowing activity. After receiving some good spells in the first half of the southwest monsoon season, it has now taken a break. Villages in the western parts of the district are receiving moderate spells, which is not halting agricultural activities. Farmers are also in need of such break.Hence, we have to wait for some more days.The villagers from Karvir, Shahuwadi, Radhanagari and Ajara tehsils are majorly facing excessive waterlogging problems.Though sugarcane is a sturdy crop in terms of supply of excess water, but here the soil and crops are constantly surrounded by water which may affect its growth.Excess water generally leads to sugarcane plant gaining more weight but sugarcane purchase price is fixed on sugar recovery rate and not on its weight. More than eight lakh hectares of agricultural land is under sugarcane cultivation alone in the district.The other damage reports of the district disaster management cell stated that losses in the current monsoon season are of damages to the houses, livestock and caving in of agricultural land."

Had Bihar government earlier got permission from the Centre for ethanol production, the state's sugar industry would have in profit.""Speaking at the BJP's 'Vikas Parva' rally at Davangere (Karnataka), Modi on Sunday declared that he would not hesitate to take on the powerful petrol-diesel lobby to boost ethanol production and reduce the dependence of farmers on sugar production in the country.

Globally, 415 million people are suffering from diabetes, of which 75% are living in low and middle income countries.The trials, led by researchers from New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) along with the US' Emory University, were conducted at ten clinical centers in India and Pakistan. The findings show the low-cost care model can help patients with diabetes double their likelihood of controlling their disease.According to Dr Nikhil Tandon, head of department - endocrinology at AIIMS, a similar study conducted a decade earlier had shown about 75% of people attending diabetes clinics had an HbA1c of more than 7%. HbA1c is a measure of average blood sugar control over three months. ""This clearly suggests that glucose control is poor and that there have been no major improvement over the last 10-15 years,"" Dr Tandon said.Experts say instead of expensive medicines, there is an urgent need for intervention to enhance patients' likelihood of managing their disease on their own by providing individualized support and enhancing the physician's likelihood of being responsive.Findings of the study show that by better controlling blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, it is possible to reduce onset of diabetes complications like heart disease, eye disease, kidney failure, which are very common in people with diabetes.""Despite improved screening and awareness, there are no efforts from various agencies to enhance the clinical skills for management of diabetes,"" says Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-DOC Centre for Diabetes. According to Dr Misra, there is need to train undergraduate doctors through specialized courses on diabetes management. Moreover, there is also need for patient counselling apart from medication etc.The World Health Organisation has projected India's diabetes burden to go up to touch 101.2 million in the next 15 years. The rapidly increasing trend of diabetes has raised alarm worldwide."

But the occasion is a joyous one, as it is Navroze or the celebration of the Parsi New Year. All thoughts of declining numbers are forgotten as soon as the tables, laden with traditional Parsi concoctions of(steamed fish),(caramel custard) and alcohol come into the picture.For the uninitiated, Parsi is an ethnic identity restricted to the descendants of Zoroastrian refugees from the Pars region in Persia (now Iran) that escaped persecution in the eighth century.Legend has it that the refugees escaped via sea and landed on the coast of Gujarat. The story goes that the local ruler expressed concern over accommodating the refugees in an already overpopulated region. Asking for a bowl of milk and some sugar, one of the Parsi leaders dissolved the sugar in the bowl full of milk and made a promise that his people would be like the sugar that would only sweeten the community and not cause it to overflow. They adopted local customs and vowed to not conduct conversions to their faith.""When the Union territory of Goa got a Parsi lieutenant governor in 1983Kershasp Tehmurasp Satarawalaadvertisements calling all Parsis in Goa to meet him were published in the newspaper. That was when we got to see how many Parsis were in Goa,"" shares Yazdi Shroff, who made Goa his home with his wife Serena in the seventies and raised their two daughters here. ""Goa was too lovely a place with too lovely a people. It has changed now, but it is still home,"" says Yazdi.It's mostly the shipping industry or alternative career options that brought Parsis to Goan shores. When Adi Doctor moved to Goa to pursue a teaching career at the state university in 1974, little did he imagine that his grandson would be celebrating what is believed to be the first navjote (initiation ceremony) in Goa. ""Goa has given me so much. I wanted all my friends and fellow Goans to experience and witness the thread ceremony,"" shares Porus Doctor of his son Shiroy's navjote ceremony.But in this Goan paradise, they are devotees without a temple, known to double as a community centre. The nearest agiary (fire temple) is in neighbouring Belagavi in Karnataka. But the absence of an agiary is not all that bad, feel some in the community. ""Consecrating a fire temple and bringing the fire, which can never be allowed to extinguish and finding a permanent dastoor (priest) pose major logistical problems. What we need is a community hall where we can gather and interact,"" shares Bogmalo resident and a descendant of a dastoor (priest) family Viraf Barucha.Serena recalls one of the first Parsi couples to move to the statethe Modys, who ran a business establishment in Panaji during the Portuguese era. ""They tried to push for an agiary in Goa. But it didn't materialize,"" Serena says.For the Buhariwallas in Dona Paula, the dream to have an agiary in Goa is a realistic one. ""With so many Zoarastrians visiting the state as tourists, having an agiary in Goa is quite practical, provided a trust is set up,"" says Hormuzd Buhariwala or patrao to his employees at his cashew factory in Marcaim.Place of worship aside, if there's one tenet that drives this rare breed, it is ""Good thoughts, good words and good deeds"".At the Vazifdars' base in Calangute, the quintessential Parsi humour and food are on offer. Zubin and Mani, moved with their two sons to set up a restaurant and live their Goan dream. They still jokingly squabble about the ""cheating"" that took place during the calculation of their wedding expenses. ""We split the guest dinner charges based on the number of guests the bride and groom invited. And his guests passed themselves off as mine,"" Mani says.""There are plenty of similarities between Parsis and Goans. We enjoy good food and drinks and share our love for Western music and football,"" shares Zubin, whose restaurant caters to the annual Navroze festivities that are the initiative of Shireen and Cawas Sidhwa, old-timers in Goa.For a community that always has and still is punching way above its weight in the country, life is a celebration. ""Forget the tiger, save the Parsi,"" our bawa Goans say in jest."

This year, even the North Indian community in Kerala has decided to steer clear of bursting crackers, plastic decorations and over-consumption of power, going in for a green Diwali ! Check out how.Mumbaikar Rekha Mahindra and her friends in Wayanad have taken a unanimous decision to avoid non-biodegradable accessories and use only recycled products to spice up their Diwali celebrations this year.""In the past, the rangoli was made with rice and pulses and was used to feed birds. So this year, we have bucked the trend of using artificial colours and returned to the old ways. It is also a good way of sharing food with small birds and ants during the festival,"" says Rekha, adding that she will be using natural flowers from her garden to give her rangoli a finishing touch.To decorate the house, they are using recycled materials instead of plastic accessories. ""Instead of candles and electric lights, we made diyas out of orange peels, coconut shells and wheat dough. And we are gifting indoor plants and kitchen herbs with cards made of recycled paper tied to them,"" Rekha explains.The group are also giving plastic gift wrappers and disposable plates a miss. ""The festival meal will be served in plantain leaves and the drinks in steel tumblers,"" she says.As the festival of lights usually sees a spike in electricity consumption, many in the State will be using natural diyas instead of electric lights. And those who have busy schedules are going for LED lights, which consume less power.Gujarati Rajani Sheth, who is settled in Kochi, says, ""I cannot imagine a Diwali without lights. For safety and ease, I was using electric lights all these years. But this year I will turn off the lights and light up diyas that are bio-degradable. Diwalis from now will also serve as 'save your electricity day' for my family.""Those who took pride in bursting the maximum number of vibrant crackers seem to have finally realised that all that expenditure is unnecessary. Bollywood actor Karan Khandelwal, who was born and brought up in Kozhikode, confesses that he and his friends have often wasted a lot of money over crackers.""This year we plan to donate all the money that we usually spend on crackers to orphanages and old-age homes. We were burning our hard-earned cash in the name of the festival, to satisfy our pride. Why not use it for charity and light up the lives of the marginalised?"" asks Karan.Many in the state have taken patriotism to another level by shunning Chinese products. ""In the previous years, I used to buy Chinese crackers that are more colourful but this year I am going solely for 'Made in India' products. I am a patriotic person and won't encourage the use of crackers from China whose policies are anti-Indian,"" says Kochi-based IT employee Karthik S, a Delhi native.Homemaker Sanjana Bhoi from Chhattisgarh, residing in Kochi, says that Diwali is the festival of lights and not of noise and pollution.Supporting her view, Bunty Singh, a Punjabi entrepreneur in Kochi, says, ""Bursting crackers is part of our tradition and we cannot skip it. However we are going for a noiseless one considering the animals in the neighbourhood. We will be using crackers like ground spinners and fountains that do not produce any sound,"" he says.Animal lover Monica Kothari says, ""Animals are sensitive and can hear noises four to seven times louder than humans. The noise of crackers is traumatic for dogs, cats and even birds. We are all for a cracker-free Diwali.""Many families of the Marwadi community in Kerala have decided to quit crackers to stay away from pollution. ""The pollution levels increase during Diwali celebrations with levels of harmful gases such as SO2 shooting up. This leads to a lot of respiratory ailments such as asthma. So, this year we have all decided to avoid crackers of all kinds,"" says Anju Rajesh Kajeriwal.A lot of people give their healthy diet a miss during Diwali. However, a few have decided to say no to the sugar loaded sweet boxes. ""Instead of milk cakes, peda and barfi, we are preparing sweets at home using millets, brown rice, rice flakes and dry fruits. Some of the sweets we make are healthier alternatives like fruit sandesh and carrot-beetroot halwa. Going a step ahead, we are replacing sugar with jaggery,"" says Priyanka Rajani, a Gujarati settled in Kannur."

The state government had set a later date this year because of the low sugarcane cultivation. In the Kolhapur region, 39 mills had applied for crushing. However, mill owners and farmers' outfits have started demanding an earlier date for to start crushing cane.""We have been receiving applications from sugar mills for early crushing. At present, very few have demanded permission to start crushing soon. The licences will be issued as per decisions that the group of ministers will take,"" a senior official from the sugar commissionerate said.While announcing the postponement in the date, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that cultivation had declined this year. This was because of the drought that the state had witnessed over the last four years.As per state figures, sugar was cultivated over a total of 6.33 lakh hectares of land. The expected sugarcane production will be 493 lakh tonne as against 750 lakh tonne reported last year. This year's sugar production is expected to dip to one of the lowest recorded in recent years. It is estimated that around 50 lakh tonne of sugar will be produced in the 2016-17 season.On Thursday, Member of Parliament and president of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna Raju Shetti met Fadnavis and demanded that the crushing season be started from November 1. Shetti had said that a delay in crushing will affect the weight of the sugarcane and ultimately the income of the farmers. The farmers may also resort to send the sugarcane to mills located in northern Karnataka The CM, however, assured Shetti that a meeting of a group of ministers will be convened, to discuss a change in the start date. Only those mills that have paid all instalments of fair and remunerative price (FRP) of the sugarcane for the last season will be given permission to start the crushing."

The Gujarati Chundo and Methiya Keri pickles (sweet mango pickles) are a true labour of love for its method of preparation and care taken that is evident in its final taste at the table, shares Bhatt, who says that the variety of mango used defines the pickle and hence insists on hand-picking the smooth and pulpy raw green Rajapuri variety of mangoes from her family farm in Gujarat for both the Chundo and Methiya Keri.Involving no cooking, these are then painstakingly grated and mixed with the perfect ratio of sugar and salt. Sundried and stirred for anywhere between 10 and 20 days, the mangoes are further treated to a generous dose of a secret spice blend of jeera powder, fine chilli powder and more, and allowed to mature for a week.The resultant bottled mix is a legendary combination of sweet, spicy and slightly sour that checks all the right boxes. Similarly her Methiya Keri pickle consists of chunky mangoes marinated in coarsely ground fenugreek seeds and mustard (kuriya) along with the spice mix. Sundried to perfection, the bottled brilliance is topped off with a thick layer of boiled pungent mustard oil. With neither any preservatives nor artificial colours, these naturally matured pickles have a shelf life of more than a year and are best paired with Indian staples such as parantha, dosa and khakhra and can even double up as a quick spread on your morning toast.

(AP)CAIRO: The weekend's hot balloon crash in Texas has been a grim reminder of a similar but deadlier accident in Egypt three years ago, when 19 foreign tourists burned to death or jumped to their deaths from the burning balloon as their sunrise flight over the famed temples of the ancient city of Luxor drew to a close.There were no survivors among the 16 people aboard the balloon that crashed in central Texas Saturday, the worst such disaster in U.S. history. Authorities there say the balloon hit high-tension power lines before crashing into a pasture near Lockhart, about 60 miles northeast of San Antonio.""I am very saddened by the accident in Texas,"" said Moamen Murad Ali, the pilot of the Luxor balloon who suffered burns over 70 percent of his body as he tried to put out the fire that consumed the balloon in just a few minutes, killing 19 foreign tourists, who included French, British, Belgian and Japanese nationals.The death toll surpassed what was believed by ballooning experts to be the deadliest accident in the sport's 200-year history: In 1989, 13 people were killed when their hot air balloon collided with another over the Australian outback near the town of Alice Springs.Recounting the final minutes of the 2013 flight in a telephone interview with The Associated Press Monday, Ali said the balloon was tantalizingly close to the ground when the fire first broke out. ""I yelled 'jump' to the passengers, but only one, a British man, did.""He and Ali were the only survivors.With the balloon lighter and the fire burning ferociously, the aircraft quickly gained altitude before a gas tank near where Ali stood exploded, hurling him out of the balloon and down to the ground. He suffered severe burns that, according to him, were caused by his tenacious attempts to put out the fire. He was hospitalized for nearly three months while under arrest on charges of negligence.After months of questioning, he said, Ali was eventually put on trial but was acquitted. Now, more than three years after the accident, he says he still needs one or two more plastic surgeries which he cannot afford.""I have spent a great deal of money on medical treatment. The balloon company let me go and no one really came forward to help me with the expenses,"" he said.""When I decided that everyone should jump, I knew that they would have all survived. I could have jumped myself, but I was too preoccupied with putting out the fire, which was like a monster,"" he said. ""I flew the same balloon the day before and I went through the check list before takeoff. The weather was fine and the wind was fair. Everything is laid out clearly for me and the ground crew. There is no room for error.""At the time of the accident, investigators said the balloon was in the process of landing when a cable got caught around a helium tube and a fire erupted, sending the balloon on an ascent and detonating a gas canister. The balloon plunged about 300 meters (1,000 feet) to the ground, crashing in a sugar cane field, they said. Balloon flights, a common recreational tourist activity in Luxor, were suspended for several months after the accident.An aviation official, also at the time of the accident, blamed Ali, saying initial results of the investigation showed he jumped out when the fire began, instead of shutting off valves that would have prevented the gas canister from exploding.""It was not human error. I did not accidentally hit a building or a power cable. This is just destiny,"" said the 32-year-old Ali, who said he had clocked 2,000 flying hours prior to the Feb. 26, 2013 accident.""It was like getting a flat tire while driving. God wills it to happen and it just happens."""
58f21f40a3d24b68099aa52b,Sweet surrender likely with sugar prices on the rise,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Sweet-surrender-likely-with-sugar-prices-on-the-rise/article14597240.ece,2016-08-30,"The effects of drought in parts of the country over the past two years are set to impact prices of sugar and confectionary items, with shortfall in sugar production in India causing a demand-supply gap.A research report by Rabobank has predicted that India would witness major a shortfall in production during this financial year and will have to import sugar, which will push prices upwards.India, the worlds second-largest producer of sugar, will witness a fall in production by 3.7 million tonnes due to consecutive droughts in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and will become a net sugar importer in 2016-17, Rabobank analysts Sudip Sinha and Kelvin Chow said in the report. Since mid-April, worldwide prices of raw sugar have risen by 30 per cent as the market started factoring in potentially lower global sugar output in this year. Domestic sugar prices across Asia also reflect the tighter supply situation.In Mumbai, sugar is retailing at Rs. 41 per kg, and the prices have gone up by Re.1 in the past three months, mostly due to inadequate supplies. As per figures with the Indian Sugar Mills Association, production in the state has dropped in the past year. Higher price trend is likely to persist over the next few quarters and will have substantial impact on Asian Food & Beverage (F&B) corporate margins The report Hurry Cane: Managing Higher Sugar Prices in Asia said.According its estimates, Asia is heading towards its first sugar deficit in over five years, and this is being led by India. Sugar production in Asia is expected to be significantly lower in the 2016-2017 sugar season, as the 2015 El Nio-induced drought pulled output down to a five-year low. For 2015-16, the forecast is that Asia will witness a deficit of an estimated two million tonnes, the report said.While Europe and Brazil could see improved production next year, the world is expected to face a sugar deficit of 5.5 million tonnes in the next sugar season, it said.While households will have to shell out more to meet their regular demand of sugar, that too in the upcoming festival season, prices of confectionary products and soft drinks may go up if the manufacturers decide to pass on the additional burden to consumers. The production cost of dairy items, mainly condensed milk and ice cream, will also go up, putting pressure on the manufacturers profit margins.The largest sugar consuming sectors are processed food-based products, confectionery and the traditional sweet-making industries, which will bear the brunt. The twin impact of sustained demand and lower 2015-16 production has pulled Asian sugar inventory to historic lows... sugar prices in the region have increased by 30-50 per cent since 2015, the report said.With subdued production expected during this year and sustained growth in demand, prices would remain high until the fourth quarter of 2016. In India, domestic prices have risen over the past 6 months and if users are slow to react, it could mean ballooning costs and a squeeze on profit margins, it said."
58f22275a3d24b68099aa7d6,"After ban, in a state of low spirits",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/After-ban-in-a-state-of-low-spirits/article14567582.ece,2016-08-21,"At the Patna Golf Club, guests trickle in twos, sip their glasses of chilled Coke bemoaning the dip in the quality of their exchange. There is a deathly silence here as a couple of stray dogs make the sprawling parking area of the club their home. Before April 5, 2016, judges, lawyers, writers and professors would bring their families and tee off in the 120-acre green space before settling down for their favourite drink. First came the ban on country liquor on April 1; four days later, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) was banned. Spirits tanked in the State. The portly bartender at the club, who made a little extra money courtesy generous tips from patrons, lost out on the Rs.8,000 he took home every month. It is all gone, says Shankar Dutt, professor of English Literature at the Patna University. Gone too is Dutts rum, the evenings and afternoons spent in the company of friends. In fact, a few hours after the formal announcement of prohibition on IMFL, as members turned up at the club in a last-ditch attempt to shore up their spirits, the Excise department beat them to it and sealed the place.The sudden about-turnRewind to nine years ago. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, in a bid to boost revenues, opened liquor vends in every village. Taking his bacchanalian zeal a step further, country liquor was made available in sachets of 200 ml, at times even offered on credit. The States coffers filled with money to the tune of Rs.4,500 crore annually. Then came the sudden turnaround: the newly elected CM in 2015 turned Gandhian in spirit.Conversations in Bihar centre around Before and After  Life Before Prohibition and Life After Prohibition. For the class of people for whom drinking is a social activity, the absence of liquor is enough to send them into bouts of depression. Alcohol in limited quantity gets the conversation going, says the genial Dutt. The Chief Minister thought otherwise and decided to make good on the promise he made last year when he announced prohibition in his election addresses. A senior official says the CMs switch is hard to explain. Some put it down to plain political ambitions of moving to the grand stage of New Delhi. Others say he has carved a place for himself among women, especially in rural Bihar, and perhaps this was his way of atoning for the excesses of the past.Stringent clauses were added to the Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016. Collective fines on villages and communities was a provision that was added. Drinking at home was made a punishable offence; police could seize utensils if it was found they were used for brewing jaggery and mahua ( Madhuca longifolia ) flowers. Draconian provisions include making sale and consumption of alcohol a non-bailable offence; arrest without warrant by the police and excise officials above the rank of sub-inspector on mere suspicion of presence of alcohol; and arrest of family members, including women, above the age of 18, if alcohol is found on the premises. Whats more, even policemen risk suspension for failure to strictly enforce the law.Protracted deliberations followed before the legislation could be hammered into place. Alliance partner Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), led by Lalu Yadav, demanded that toddy (fermented extract from sugar palm)  pronounced taadi  be kept out, though it is a mystery as the number of toddy tappers is few, bureaucrats point out. But the CMs Janata Dal (United) partymen point out that there are 1.5 million tappers in the State and they are Pasis, a Dalit caste. So while IMFL is banned, taadi, which is mildly intoxicating when fermented, has been kept out to appease the RJD. Desi liquor made from mixing mahua with jaggery on low flame and fermented for over three days has been banned and ironically, this has affected a key constituency  Musahars, a Mahadalit caste traditionally identified as rat-catchers.Bouquets and brickbatsAcross the State the prohibition on the sale and consumption of alcohol has evoked both anger and a sigh of relief.On the dusty outskirts of Patna city, the Musahars of Phulwari Sharif, Govindpur, are a sullen lot. The inhabitants live a wretched existence, most of them garbage collectors or fitters or extra farm hands. The unreliable source of income was compensated for by selling mahua. That is well-nigh over now. The Musahars are still making a valiant effort to brew it in stealth even as the police, under instructions, break their kilns. In fact, with prohibition, mahua has started attracting a premium. What was once sold for Rs.100 a kg is now selling for Rs.300 and brought in by road or trains. Often the consignments are confiscated. Says a Phulwari Sharif resident, The cops arrest us and expect money from us. It is a routine, raising questions about the efficacy of the ban.At the Prarambhik Prathamik Vidyalaya, a local school, teachers are fighting a different battle  to enrol children from the Musahar community even as the potent smell of mahua wafts by. Even the prospect of a mid-day meal  assuring the children of at least one wholesome meal in a day  isnt enough to attract numbers; the parents are more inclined towards sending out their little ones to pick garbage as their income from selling mahua dries up.For women, who constitute nearly 55 million of the voting population of 105 million, and who came out in overwhelmingly large numbers to vote in favour of Kumar in the last Assembly elections, a total ban is the only way out. A sub-inspector at Phulwari Sharif echoes this sentiment but she has another problem. We are with the Chief Minister on this move but his decision to punish Station House Officers (SHOs) will not send the right signal as there are many honest officers, just as there are corrupt ones too, says Savitri Kumar. Eleven SHOs, including the SHO of this thana, have been suspended for dereliction of duty and the Bihar Policemens Association is on the warpath. We used to work 10-12 hours a day; now we work 18 hours, says its president Mrityunjay Kumar Singh. The associations demand is that the suspended SHOs be reinstated and the high performers rewarded. We are being targeted by the administration, and by the people when we move to arrest them, adds Singh.There are few who believe his version. The tough-talking Principal Secretary, K.K. Pathak, is one of them. The prime executor of the CMs design, who was parachuted into the State a few months before the legislation was drafted, believes the police should do more. Sitting in a sprawling room with posters designed by students of the College of Arts and Crafts, Patna, on the ill-effects of alcohol, he keeps a close watch on the control room which has a toll-free number  18003456268  manned by 12 operators from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. As we watch, there are informers from far-flung interiors calling in. The state has thrown in a bait: inform and win reward.It is not true that we are arresting women or every adult above the age of 18 when found in possession of alcohol. We often found that men feigned ignorance when questioned. There were cases when the man of the house fled, leaving his teenaged daughter behind. The mere threat of arresting every adult of the house is enough for the man or any other male in the house to own up and, in some instances, for an entire village to point out the black sheep amidst them, says Pathak.Reports from the ground, however, reveal another story.The test case villageOutside the unplastered house of Usha Devi in Deewan Pokhar village of Bhagalpur, the district administration has pasted a notice (No: 779 dated. 4.9.2016) asking her to respond to the show-cause notice for violating prohibition provisions. She has been given 14 days to respond, failing which a fine of Rs.1 lakh will be imposed. The iron gate of her house is locked and her four small children huddle around perplexed why their mother, a daily wage labourer, is unable to provide food to them.Deewan Pokhar is the first village in Bihar where show-cause notices have been served on five residents under the new law: Phulka Devi, Poonam Devi, Ratna Devi and Sevak Chaudhury, besides Usha Devi. Two of them, Phulka Devi and Poonam Devi, were arrested on July 30 and sent to jail after the police recovered 220 litres of countrymade liquor from their houses. The district administration is also mulling over the prospect of imposing a community fine on the residents under the provisions of the new law. Two other villages are also in the firing line.Ever since Phulka Devi was put behind bars, her three little children have been running a small makeshift shop selling biscuits and lozenges to survive. The eldest, Golu Kumar, is just 12 years old and he looks after his two younger siblings Rahul Kumar and Bishun Kumar. Poonam Devis children too have to fend for themselves. Her daughter wonders why her mother has been jailed for doing something which was acceptable a year ago. She now looks after her three brothers and one sister. Please speak to the authorities and save my daughter, says Poonam Devis mother.The only male accused, Sevak Chaudhury, works as labourer in a factory. Chaudhury has two small sons and a seven-year-old daughter, and though he did brew country liquor, he had stopped after the ban. This time the administration implicated me with a threat of a Rs.1 lakh fine going by my past record. They didnt find even a single bottle of liquor from my house! he says.Witch-hunt on a hunch?The families in Deewan Pokhar village that stare at a Rs.1 lakh fine are Mahadalits engaged in their traditional occupation of taadi -tapping. Why are only people from the poor Mahadalit community being caught, arrested and sent to jail along with threats of community fine? Is it the case that only these communities drink liquor? asks Brajesh Chaudhury, an educated youth of the village, before he proceeds to answer the question himself: It has nothing to do with liquor consumption. The well-off backward and upper-caste people of the village have got a new tool in their hand to oppress the lower-caste Mahadalits. There are about 40-45 houses of Mahadalits in Deewan Pokhar.Birendra Nath Choubey, Assistant Sub-Inspector at the local Habibpur police station, denies these allegations. Despite several raids they were not mending their ways and continued making countrymade liquor in their houses, he says. Excise Superintendent Vijay Shankar Dubey insists he will continue to take strict action till the district is liquor-free. Bhagalpur District Magistrate Adesh Titarmare, who had served the notice on the five Deewan Pokhar residents, says it was on account of their repeated violation of prohibition provisions.The Opposition parties have dubbed the new State excise and prohibition law draconian and a black law. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had proposed altogether 17 amendments to the new Bill but the government refused to oblige them. We oppose this draconian law under which all adult members of the family can be arrested and sent to jail if even a wrapper or bottle of liquor is found in their house well take this issue to the streets, says senior State BJP leader Nand Kishore Yadav.His young party MLA Nitin Navin asks rhetorically, If all adult members are sent to jail after a liquor bottle is found in the house, why not Chief Minister Nitish Kumar when liquor is seized in the State?The ruling alliance partners, RJD and Congress, had to issue whips to their party MLAs to support the new excise Act in the Assembly. Our government has decided to make the State liquor-free and were supporting the move its an issue which has huge social impact, defends Deputy CM Tejaswi Yadav of the RJD, who is the son of Lalu Yadav.Revenue tap goes dryAccording to a new report tabled in the Assembly in the monsoon session by Finance Minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui, the States revenue has gone down and many attribute this fall to prohibition. From Rs.897 crore in 2015 between April and June, the revenue is down just Rs.42.27 crore this year in the same months. This new excise and prohibition law is bound to have some hard impact on the States financial health. How to make up for an annual loss of Rs.4,500 crore is a big question, says economist Nawal Kishore Chaudhary.Patna had 70 liquor outlets run by a group of 58 people. The liquor barons, their business sunk, drop hints that they have bankrolled political parties for as long as they can remember. Says one of them, Two breweries, UB and Carlsberg, were planning to operationalise their plants here. Its not just liquor, but soda, the entire ancillary industry making bottles, corks all have shut down, he points out. Bihar Industries Association general secretary Subodh Kumar, who owns a soda-making unit, is thinking of shifting it to Siliguri in West Bengal. People dont order soda without their drink. What should I do, he asks. The State government is hoping to persuade liquor shops to now sell milk products under the Sudha Dairy brand of the Bihar State Milk Co-Operative Federation Ltd. patterned on the lines of the successful Amul venture. Only one erstwhile liquor vend is selling milk now.Hotel occupancies are going down too as guests can no longer bring liquor or have them on the premises. A hotelier says, In the last three months, corporates have preferred to host their conferences and meetings in neighbouring Ranchi [in Jharkhand].In response to his critics, the Bihar CM blogged on a news portal on August 10: If one is serious and determined to see through prohibition in Bihar, then there is no place for ifs and buts. A combination of a fair and strict implementation of law coupled with an inspired peoples campaign is a way to go. The question, though, on everyones mind is: how long before Nitish Kumar blinks?Its not just liquor, but soda, the entire ancillary industry making bottles, corks all have shut down. A liquor baronWhy are only people from the poor Mahadalit community being sent to jail? Do only people from this community drink liquor? Brajesh Chaudhury, resident of Deewan Pokhar villageWith prohibition, mahua is attracting a premium. What was once sold for Rs.100 a kg is now selling for Rs.300 and brought in by road or trains"

Express photo Punjabs Finance Minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa speaks on states fiscal health, static tax revenue, fat salaries bill, liabilities and outstanding bills before tabling of the budget. Express photoAs you are ready with the annual budget, how do you see states fiscal health?We have successfully improved our fiscal situation. We have managed our fiscal deficit within the recommended limit of 3 per cent as per the fiscal consolidation roadmap laid out by the 13th Finance Commission. We have achieved this target with 2.97 per cent deficit. Similarly, the states debt should be less than 38.7 per cent of the GSDP in 2014-15 and though the debt now stands at Rs 1.24 lakh crore, it is 32.27 per cent of the GSDP. Next year, the debt will be 31.34 per cent of the GSDP.How many times did the state go in overdraft this fiscal?I do not remember it off hand. But it was much lesser times compared to last.What is your biggest concern?The tax revenue. It has not grown as it should have. This affects the cash flow. Otherwise, the situation is stable. Coming year would be better.Are you planning to introduce any new taxes?Next years budget proposal is a secret document. It is the privilege of the Assembly to learn about any new proposals before anyone else.Who is to be blamed for the static tax revenue?The global economic slowdown. collections on account of stamp duty on registration of property have come down from Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 1,500 crore due to slump in real estate market. Also, the revenue generated through registration of new vehicles has also come down as lesser new vehicles were purchased by people in the state.What about poor growth of VAT?The minuscule growth in VAT collections is not unique to Punjab. It is a pan India phenomenon. I have had discussions with finance ministers of states like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat and similar trend exists in those states as well. The silver lining is that we have not recorded a negative growth in VAT.You present a rosy picture about the fiscal health. Why are states properties being mortgaged?Not a single property was mortgaged this year. Two years ago, PUDA mortgaged properties to generate funds. We have already returned half of the loans generated against these.What about the pending bills?We have pending bills worth Rs 2,000 crore. But considering that we have already paid bills worth Rs 40,000 crore this year, an amount of Rs 2,000 crore is minuscule. Each year, during March, we are in a capacity of clearing bills worth Rs 4-5,000 crore. Hence, these bills would be cleared as we come to a close. Last year, we had unexpected expenditures including sugar subsidy and Rs 300 crore worth compensation to farmers.You have always frowned upon the fat salaries bill. What burns a hole in the states pocket?We have a fat salaries bill amounting to Rs 28,000 crore. It is a cause for concern for us. The bill has been growing by 10-15 per cent every year in the last five years. The implementation of pay commission reports, arrears and installments of DA really burn a hole in our pocket.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But today, mothers are aware of its nutritious value and feed it to their babies, said Dr P V Anuradha, obstetrician-gynecologist in Chennai. The colostrum is said to be packed with antibodies and immunoglobulins, proving essential for the protection of the baby. Its mild laxative effect also helps the baby pass its first stool called meconium. Thankfully, certain funny practices like feeding the baby sugar water and such have also come down, she added.Doctors said that babies should be breastfed exclusively for the first six months.But, according to the district level Household and Facility Survey-4 (DLHS-4) that was conducted in 2012-2013, only a little over half of children (51.3%) from 0-5 months in rural Tamil Nadu were exclusively breastfed.Despite the dismal numbers, anganwadi workers in various districts of the State maintained that lack of breastfeeding awareness in their localities was a rarity.Sumathi (35), who has been working at the Manakollai Anganwadi in Thiruvarankulam, Pudukkotai for two years, said, In our area almost every woman breastfeeds her child. Everyone from agricultural labourers to construction workers, breastfeeds their children without fail.Ambika, who works in an anganwadi in Pappanpatti agrees. She said that some mothers would even breastfeed their children during class hours since children from one and half years of age were admitted to the anganwadi.Every year, we celebrate breastfeeding week to create breastfeeding awareness. But in our locality, there is actually no need for awareness campaigns since all mothers breastfeed their children, she said. But experts say that there is still a lot to be desired.I have been treating at least 20 babies every month for loose stools, vomiting and other illnesses due to artificial feeding, said Dr. Hariharan, paediatrician of Denkanikottai Government Hospital in Krishnagiri.He pointed out that even educated people in rural areas breastfeed their children only for two months and then start with other food such as cows milk and ragi-based liquid food whereas in the nearby tribal areas the babies were breastfed at least for five months.Certain practices that have become increasingly common in urban areas are still unheard of in the rural parts of the state, according to sources.For instance, in the rural areas, women leave for work without knowing that breast milk can be stored. Now almost every house has a refrigerator but they dont know that it can be used to store breast milk, said Lalitha N, a senior advocate, Madras High Court who has worked in several women and child health campaigns."

The idea is aimed at ensuring more supply into the market so that prices would not go up drastically. The mills are asked to stock maximum 37% of their total produce.An official announcement on the norm is expected in a couple of days, a senior official from the state cooperation department said.The current retail market prices of sugar are in the range of Rs 40 to Rs 45. Every year the prices surge during the festival season. To avoid it, the government has decided restrict the sugar stock to 37% of the total production. The mandatory export quota will not not be included in this stock limit .P G Medhe, consultant to the Chhatrapati Rajaram Cooperative Sugar Mill here said that sugar mills will be allowed to keep only 37% stock from October 1. This would push the mills to sell more sugar in the retail market and the excess supply will keep the prices under control.A senior trader said that the Union and the state governments are aware of the fact that people will not buy more sugar just because prices are down.Sugar production in the state has gone up consistently in the past three years. The unsold sugar has led to piling up of stock and putting pressure on factories. There has been financial assistance from the government to the factories, but it has limited reach. Had the government increased its assistance, factories would have been able to sell the sugar in the market, sources said.In June, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank, the premiere bank at state level among the cooperative sector, has kept the sugar valuation unchanged at Rs 3,100 per quintal. This has helped in stabilising the prices in the wholesale as well as the retail market.The actual prices are, however, hovering around Rs 3,550 to Rs 3,600 per quintal."

Congress units in the sugar belt, considered a Pawar stronghold, are averse to an alliance or understanding with the NCP.Chavan met Pune district leaders, recently.

They have mixed feelings about an alliance with the NCP. We are not jumping to any conclusion about an alliance. We will go by what our district unit leaders say,"" Chavan said. Congress district heads and leaders told Chavan that NCP has ""used"" the party to remain in power and this time the party must lock horns with the NCP. ""It is not the BJP or Shiv Sena that has weakened the Congress, but the NCP which has eaten into Congress's base,"" a senior leader in Pune said.Congress leaders in rural areas have accused Pawar and his party of trying to hijack the Maratha silent marches after Pawar recently met Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""We don't have anything to say about Pawar meeting Modi and discussing the marches. The Congress party is with the community and has nothing to say about Pawar's meet with Modi,"" Chavan told TOI.However, a section of Congress leaders which submitted its say to the MPCC stated the party must continue its alliance with the NCP considering the rising clout of the BJP in the rural parts of the state. A majority of Zilla Parishads and taluka panchayats, which are the nerves centres of rural politics, are controlled by the Congress and the NCP.For first time, the BJP is trying to breach the rural bastion of the NCP-Congress with full force.

Bogus ration cards, even those of deceased persons, are widely used to steal subsidy by showing fictional transactions on paper.Curiously, ration shop records often show that 90 per cent of beneficiaries drew their PDS quota on the last day of the month.The inspections will start at the point of sales and move up the supply chain to identify and plug loopholes that allow corruption and theft. Investigators will randomly check whether PDS commodities are released in the presence of beneficiaries. They will verify stock positions in warehouses and ration shops.Surplus stockPresence of surplus stock indicates hoarding for illegal diversion.Retailers are mandated to prominently display the stock position of foodgrains, kerosene, sugar and flour in ration shops. There are an estimated 14,300 ration shops in the State. Vigilance investigators will also tail trucks moving PDS commodities, particularly kerosene, from warehouses to depots to detect pilferage, if any.Officials say subsidised PDS foodgrains ended up as branded products in the open market. The profits involved are manifold. FCI warehouses will also come under the Vigilance scanner.The agency has received complaints that the physical movement of grains from warehouses to retailers is often just on paper.Blatant corruptionIt is alleged that trucks carrying PDS grains often drove straight from warehouses to factories owned by private branded rice product manufacturers.Illegally diverted PDS kerosene ends up as fuel in fishing boats, earthmovers and generators that power cinema halls and marriage auditoriums.Past studies indicate that only 40 per cent of the PDS commodities reach intended beneficiaries"

They said that sugarcane crop in more than 2 lakh hectares had been lost due to natural calamities in the State during 2015-16 and that the farmers who had invested could not get any crop insurance compensation as sugarcane had not been included under the crop insurance scheme. Mr. Rajapur said that the failure on the part of sugar factories in the North Karnataka districts to pay according to the FRP fixed by the government is forcing sugarcane growers to shift to other crops, with sugarcane production in Kalaburagi district coming down to 15 lakh tonnes during 2015-16 from 30 lakh tonnes in 2014-15.

But he will leave the 31st Olympic Games wondering how to fill their places.There is no one in sight with the sporting power nor the charisma to take the place of Phelps and Bolt  who have 32 gold medals between them  in the swimming pool or on the running track.Bolt and his nine golds over three Olympics cannot be countered.Phelps won five golds in Rio at the age of 31 having retired once and come .From Beijing in 2008 through London 2012 and, finally, in Rio, Bolt and Phelps captivated die-hard fans of their sports and casual spectators attracted like moths to the Olympic flame.Both presaged their mature exploits with precocious Olympics appearances, Phelps as a 15-year-old contesting the 200m butterfly in 2000, and Bolt, at 17, finishing fifth in his heat in the 200m in 2004.By those Games in Athens in 2004, Phelps was already challenging Mark Spitzs record of seven titles at one Games, coming away with six golds and two bronze. In Beijing he cemented his place among Games greats with a perfect eight golds in eight events at the Water Cube while Bolt electrified the Birds Nest stadium with his 100m, 200m and 4x100m sprint triumphs.From Beijing on they were linked in Games lore, each adding to his legacy in 2012  Bolt with another sprint sweep and Phelps with four more gold to add to his staggering tally of Olympic medals.Although a burned-out Phelps flirted with retirement after London, it was fitting that his decision to return for one last, fifth, campaign, saw him bow out at the same time as Bolt.The Jamaicans unprecedented third sweep of the 100m, 200m and 4x100m means debate will rage loud and long as to which can claim the status of greatest Olympian.Phelps leads the medals table by a mile. His five golds in Rio took his already stunning tally to 23 gold among a total of 28.Bolt, meanwhile, has dominated in the tests of speed that are the quintessential sporting contests, maintaining his supremacy over an unprecedented span of years.Its a massive gap, but its not a gap that is insuperable, International Association of Athletics Federations president Sebastian Coe said of Bolts departure.He compared it to questions asked with Alis withdrawal in the 1970s. Well, Floyd Mayweather, Marvin Hagler, Manny Pacquiao and Sugar Ray Leonard came along.  AFP"

Photo: special arrangementThe brains musical part often works in a funny manner, and my brain is no exception. Two weeks ago, this column was headlined Yesterday Once More. It was about a totally different subject, but it simply made me start humming the Carpenters hit with the same name.So I sang the opening lines, When I was young I listened to the radio, waiting for my favourite songs; When theyd play Id sing along; It made me smile. The words made me nostalgic, and recall the late 1970s when, between ages 13 and 15, radio ruled my life and shaped my musical taste forever.I grew up in New Delhi, and my parents used a Philips record system and Sony mono-cassette player. I had restricted radio timings. All India Radio was a favourite, but I would sometimes sneakily tune into Radio Ceylon, BBC or Voice of America. On Doordarshan, a pop show hosted by Ajit Singh was the only option.On radio, Hindi film songs dominated. Rajesh Khanna was pass, but his chartbusters played often. Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor songs were a rage. For English music, there was In The Groove, which aired around 8 p.m. The weekly late-night shows included Forces Requests, where defence officers sent song requests, and A Date With You, targeted at the youth.I listened clandestinely, putting off the lights, and pretending to sleep. I didnt know headphones existed. The volume was loud enough for me to hear clearly, and low enough not to carry across to my parents room.As a child, I had heard records of Cliff Richard, Jim Reeves, Harry Belafonte and The Sound Of Music songs. But radio was an entirely new world.The airplay primarily consisted of pop, evergreens and country, with a bit of radio-friendly rock.In retrospect, the popular artistes could be divided into three categories. The first included those I first heard on the radio, and continued to pursue by buying vinyl records, cassettes and CDs. These included the Beatles, ABBA, Boney M, Bee Gees, Donna Summer, Cerrone, John Denver, the Carpenters, Bread, the Eagles, Uriah Heep, Santana, Pink Floyd and songs from the films Saturday Night Fever and Grease .Secondly, some singers were recognised for only one song in India, but werepopular abroad. Examples of such hits were Mary Hopkins Those Were The Days, Gloria Gaynors I Will Survive, Carl Douglas Kung Fu Fighting, George McRaes Rock Your Baby, Tina Charles Dance Little Lady, Baccaras Yes Sir, I Can Boogie, the Archies Sugar Sugar, Susan Rayes LA International Airport and Glen Campbells Rhinestone Cowboy. The recently-revived Johnny Wakelin songs In Zaire and Black Superman, dedicated to Muhammad Ali, were huge.Thirdly, some acts were prolific on radio in the 1970s, but lost much attention in the next decade. Yet, we bought their compilations years later. These included Paul Anka, Perry Como, Lobo, Diana Ross, Bread, Brotherhood of Man and George Baker Selection.What music, indeed. Radio still remains a habit, late at night. But thinking of those classics, my mind started wandering again. I tried to recall five songs with radio in their title. Bingo! Queens Radio Ga-Ga, Donna Summers On The Radio, Don Williams Listen To The Radio, Rushs Spirit Of The Radio and ironically, the Buggles Video Killed The Radio Star.I had to hear them. And I found them in a second  on YouTube! I didnt have to depend on radio or dig my collection. How times have changed.The author is a freelance music writer"

These risk factors are genetic, environmental and lifestyle related, say endocrinologists.Both diabetes and GD are increasingly common. Obesity, genetic and environmental factor up the risk of diabetes, which, during pregnancy, can manifest as GD in such high-risk women, said Dr. G. Arun, senior endocrinologist at Yashoda Hospitals. The risk of TDM notwithstanding, uncontrolled GD is associated with congenital malformations, besides babies being born with abnormal sugar and calcium levels.The World Health Organization estimates there are about a lakh women aged between 30 and 70 years. If a recently published research paper is any indication, a substantial number of Indian diabetic women who gave birth may have increased their risk of TDM with a history of GD.Published in the journal Diabetic Medicine, the paper based its findings on women studied at Owaisi Hospital and MHRT in Hyderabad, and AIIMS in New Delhi. It showed an increased risk of TDM for women with GD. Of the 366 women with GD, 119 had developed DM in five years, while 144 developed prediabetes, a precursor to diabetes characterised by higher than normal sugar levels, which, if left untreated, progresses to DM.According to a meta-analysis published last year by one of the current studys authors Dr. Roya Rozati, women with history of GD may have as much as eight times higher risk of developing TDM when compared to women with normal levels of glucose tolerance during pregnancy.The incidence of TDM was lowered in our cohort as women underwent lifestyle modification after delivery. Maintaining healthy BMI and capping it at under 27 is key to lowering risk of GDM and subsequent TDM, said Dr. Rozati, who heads the city-based MHRT Infertility Centre. The paper also showed that the risk of TDM increases with age, higher body-mass index and the presence of condition called acanthosis nigricans, skin hyper-pigmentation seen in those with insulin resistance.Both diabetes and GD are increasingly common.

Kulkarni told presspersons here on Sunday that the situation was alarming with the Bhima fast drying and the district authorities preventing farmers from drawing water from the riverbed by disconnecting power supply to irrigation pumpsets to save water to meet drinking water requirement of human dwellings on the banks of the river.Mr. Rajapur said that the sugarcane crop on the banks of the river was fast drying due to stoppage of water supply to the fields.The State government should immediately ask sugar factories in the district to take up sugarcane harvesting in the fields on priority and start crushing.If lack of rain in the command areas was one of the reasons for the Bhima drying up so early this year, another reason was the illegal extraction of sand in the riverbed.He charged the Union and State governments with being hand-in-glove with the managements of sugar factories.A majority of sugar factories continued to defy the diktats of the governments on the payment of sugarcane prices as per the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) fixed by the Union government.Mr. Rajapur said that the State government had failed to fix price for sugarcane this year and the factories were also not paying price as per the Fair and Remunerative Price of Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 2,650 per tonne for 2015-16. They were paying around Rs. 1,500 per tonne, he added.The governments had done very little to exert pressure on sugar factories to clear dues of sugarcane growers.In Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts, the combined dues for 2014-15 and 2015-16 from sugar factories stood at Rs. 132 crore.The Bhima riverbed is fast drying up, says State sugarcane growers' association"

They will be judged on artistic expression and technical skill, as well as professional ethics, hygiene and taste.And appraising the work of the 16 will be a jury consisting of Avijit Ghosh, corporate pastry chef, The Leela Hotels, Palaces and Resorts; TV show host, chef and food stylist Ranveer Brar; Parvinder Singh Bali, corporate chef, learning and development, Oberoi Centre for Learning and Development; and Nikesh Kumar Sharma, MD of hosts Academy of Pastry Arts.According to Chef Parvinder, the art of pastry making has become more accessible (and more hip, too), since it's no longer confined to five-star hotels. ""Gulab jamun and jalebi are very passe, and people want to explore,"" he says. ""So if high-end catering can provide you with a good tiramisu or chocolate mousse, it obviously talks about the style statement of that wedding, function or party. And somebody doing a souffle becomes a wow thing.""So a career in home baking, if not high-street pastry making, awaits any of these 'sweet' 16."
