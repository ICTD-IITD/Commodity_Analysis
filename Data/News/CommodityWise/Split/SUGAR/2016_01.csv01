""In today's vastly changing lifestyle, the number of patients who are being attacked by arthritis is growing by leaps and bounds,"" said Dr. Smruti Ramteke , a rheumatologist at Jasleen hospital . She took up the opportunity to spread more and more awareness among the masses related to this disease.October 12, 2016 will be observed as the 'World arthritis day' and thus, the doctor deliberated on the various aspects of the causes and symptoms related to this disease. ""Rheumatoid arthritis, though an inflammatory disease will start affecting your body if not treated in the early stage. The exact cause of the disease is yet to be known but it is the combining factors of genetic predisposition, environment influence and immune system,"" she said. Shockingly, she revealed that women, especially from ages 20 to 50, are three times more prone to develop rheumatoid arthritis than men. ""The women start feeling helpless as they are not able to work or do the daily chores. They basically become dependent and feel like they are a burden. At an extreme stage, they even become suicidal. Thus, this disease leads to physical pain as well as mental trauma,"" she added.Another type of arthritis is osteoarthritis which affects men and women equally. ""The increased percentage of obesity among people above the age group of 40 is one of the reasons of osteoarthritis,"" she mentions. ""It is the number one disease which affects most people in the country, taking over diabetes too. A major reason for this is lack of physical activity and insufficiency in the nutrition intake,"" she explained. As most households still prepare food according to their traditions, the oil, sugar and salt used in the preparation is in high amounts which can be a factor to this disease. ""The best prevention to this disease is a good physical activity with a combination of walking, yoga and gym. The children should be made to play in the grounds and not be restricted to schools and home. The elders should not just walk or gym, but do an effective combination of cardio and weights for strength,"" she suggested.Ankylosing spondylitis is a disease that mostly grasps the young men which causes severe back ache. ""Arthritis is a disease that can be controlled in the long term, if it is detected earlier, and then it can be controlled in a better manner. The most important prevention to this disease in spreading awareness as most people do not come forward or keep taking wrong medications. There is a lack of information on the availability of effective treatment, fear of modern medicines and belief in native therapies which need to be uprooted, "" Ramteke concluded"
58f252b3a3d24b68099ac344,42 industrial units respond to pollution board notices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/42-industrial-units-respond-to-pollution-board-notices/articleshow/55084238.cms,2016-10-27,"PUNE: A day after TOI reported that as many as 72 high-pollution industries in the Pune region were issued closure notices by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the board's state arm MPCB said that most of the listed units had responded.The industries, mostly sugar units, distilleries, dye, pharmaceutical and iron & steel factories, had not complied with previous orders to install online continuous monitoring systems (CMS) on their premises.An MPCB official said that 42 industries in the Pune region (Pune, Solapur and Satara districts) responded to the notice by Wednesday. ""While most of these have complied with the order, three are yet to submit the data citing that installation of CMS is currently in process. Thirteen others have stated that CMS had been installed at the unit but was not connected to the MPCB or CPCB server,"" the official stated.Asked about the remaining 30 units out of 72, the official said that these 42 units were the only ones that were pending response out of the total. CPCB had, in 2014 and 2015, ordered all units under Category 17 of highly-polluting industries across the country to install CMS and submit their respective data from the system on the CPCB server. The CMS enables CPCB and its state arms to monitor the quality of effluents let out by the unit in real time. However, at least 295 such industries had been found to be in violation of the orders as of September 30, 2016, of which 72 were in Pune region alone. Of these, majority of the units were from the sugar industry.Owing to this, the CPCB had issued closure direction for all these units on October 13. The CPCB had also asked its respective state arms to ensure power and water supply to these units was cut. The board's recent drastic steps have resulted in the industries complying with the earlier orders."
58f253fba3d24b68099ac3fa,On an organic food trail in Chennai,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/On-an-organic-food-trail-in-Chennai/articleshow/53810213.cms,2016-08-23,"Famous American author-journalist, Michael Pollan, once said, ""Don't eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn't recognise as food."" But while that would mean giving up on all things junk for this generation of foodies, as it signifies food in its original, unadulterated form. Or what we, with great flourish, call 'organic food'. There were no pesticides, no unwanted chemicals , no MSG, no other additives in the cuisines our grandmothers dished out. Not only that, they loved millets, in all its various, fibrous, nutritious glory. For a while, organic food had come to mean 'upmarket' in the city, but now, with a resurgent love for eating healthy, many restaurants have come up in the city that swear by grandmothers' organic recipes and the ingredients they used.With 28 items, including five starters, three rows of vegetables, sambhar, rasam, curd, mor kuzhambu and red rice, one would think Rajakeeyam, the King's meal at Sanjeevanam is a very heavy meal. But Murugan, the operations head here, says, ""A normal thali will come up to 1,800 calories, but the Rajakeeyam with all the dishes only comes up to 1,024 calories. This is a perfect meal that is not too heavy on your tummy, is nutritious and easily digestible."" The meal follows naturopathy concept and is completely satvik. ""We don't use tamarind, red chillies, refinied items, polished sugar or maida in our food. We have supplements for all of this and our masalas are freshly ground. Our vegetables are grown in our farm and the food is fresh,"" he says. Their millet dosa and upma are big hits with patrons. Murugan adds that their vazhaipoo and corn vadai that are the show-stealers. ""You will not find deep-fried bajjis and bondas here, for snacks; you get sundal, ela ada and kozhukattai. Our food is rich in vitamins, fibre and proteins which is the concept of naturopathy. It is very important to change our lifestyle and avoid junk food. A lot of our health issues will automatically be resolved then,"" he says.Located near the Aranganathan Subway, Tamil Unavagam is a tiny outlet, which offers a variety of dishes at reasonable prices. ""We generally deliver food to corporates for lunch and provide a wholesome meal that includes organic sambar rice, curd rice and poriyal. A lot of office-goers these days prefer millet-based food because it keeps them fit. Everybody has become health-conscious these days,"" says a partner of the place, AK Ravishankar. The common myth about organic food is that it is expensive. Ravishankar agrees and says, ""Demand for organic food is more and the supply is limited, which is why organic food is costly. If all the farmers turn organic, this issue will never arise,"" says Ravishankar. Puttu, keerai dosa and paniyaram are their must-haves. Wash it down with paruthi paal, panakarkandu paal or jigarthanda. Ravishankar also points out that Chennai needs more number of organic restaurants. ""There are hardly 10 restaurants that serve organic and healthy food. Bangalore has several options when compared to Chennai,"" he says. Ravishankar and his team also take cooking classes for women so they can start preparing organic food at home.If you are looking to eat something that is light, healthy and refreshing, then Mahamudra is one place you can head to. Started in 2010, the restaurant is famous for its wheat bisibele bath, akki and ragi roti and wheat payasam. ""A lot of people have forgotten how to make traditional dishes like ragi kanji. We want to serve dishes that our grandmothers used to make on a regular basis. Making millet-based food is easy and is not very time-consuming. The dishes that are usually made with rice batter can also be made with millets, by simply substituting rice with millets. As for the younger generation, I believe that their mindset has to change. They have to start adapting organic food in their lifestyle. One must include ghee, jiggery, and honey in their meal to lead a healthy living,"" shares Meena Thennaapan, who takes care of the quality check in the restaurant. But where do they procure the ingredients from? ""We get a lot of our basics from Coimbatore and we also procure rice and other things from the local market. We try and make the food as natural and organic as possible,"" she says.Prems Graama Bhojanam is a two-year-old restaurant tucked away on the first-floor of an old building. It has a varied customer base, from young foreigners looking for an authentic meal, to the 60-year-old, who is looking for a taste of home-cooked food at a restaurant. The owner of the restaurant, NS Krishnamoorthi, loves being the chatty host. He says, ""It is our lunch meals that pull in most of the crowd. The thali includes the varagu sambar saadam, kuthiraivali rasam saadam, samai thayir saadam, a sweet made from jaggery and millet, karakozhambu with ragi, bajra and millet balls and bottle gourd curry mixed with peanut powder. In fact, our drinking water has edible camphor, tulsi, cardamom and cloves in it, because that is how people used to drink water back then. It has immense health benefits, too."" The restaurant also has a list of tiffin items to choose from like thatte idli, kuzhi paniyaram and benne dosa. Hailing from a small village near Hosur, Krishnamoorthi grew up eating organic food all his life, and wanted to recreate the same experience in Chennai. ""Back in my day, food was not this adulterated. We lived with basics, ate good food and life was not this fast. Today, youngsters earn good money, but are losing their health. Lifestyle and food habits have changed and it starts reflecting on our health after the age of 30. We need to get closer to nature. People these days want bigger papayas and sweeter mangoes, which is why growth-enhancing chemicals are added to the crops. We should embrace what nature gives us. Over the last couple of years, however, youngsters are becoming more conscious of what they eat and want to consume healthy food,"" he says.Ka Unavagam follows the farm-to-farm concept. Anita, one of the partners at the restaurant, explains what that means. ""We procure seeds from a company and give it to the farmers, we then buy the produce from the farmers and the organic waste is returned to the farmers so that they can make manure with it. So we take from the farm and give it back to the farm,"" she says. Opened in April in Besant Nagar, the most popular dish at this joint is their agar agar dessert. ""Going organic is not just about millets and bajra. We produce only organic vegetables and rice. Anything that is produced without the involvement of chemicals is organic. But the issue, these days, is that nothing can be labelled 100 per cent organic. The land is way too polluted and it takes a good six years to get the soil back to its original form. The other advantage with growing organic food is that it improves the ground water. So besides millets and ragi, we also serve the usual white rice, sambar, etc that is organic,"" shares Anita, who is hard to catch during the weekends as the restaurant keeps her busy. But is organic food becoming popular among youngsters? ""People are educated these days. They come back to the restaurant again and again because the food doesn't give them indigestion and is light on their stomachs. I don't see the need for youngsters to have pizza and burger. The superfood that people talk about these days, like chia seeds, and quinoa, is unnecessary. When we have our version of rice flakes and millet flakes, I don't think we need oats,"" points out Anita. Don't miss their ragi kozhukattai, kambu koozh, kombucha and paniyaram that are delicious and a quick bite for those who are on the move. They also have a Chinese section to please the crowd. ""We don't add ajinomoto and our noodles are made out of millets. We need to watch what we eat, only then the next generation will follow our footsteps,"" she says."

The contracts are all through Myanmar and from there its just being taken up country.The smuggling of agricultural products along Chinas borders with Vietnam and Myanmar has long been a problem.Chinas sugar industry has urged the government to tackle resurgence in smuggling across the countrys southern borders, after huge volumes of cheap sugar were estimated to have illegally entered the country in recent months.Mr Sawhney also said domestic sugar production would reach 26 million tonnes in the 2015/2016 season, which runs from October to September, and would probably see the same figure for the coming 2016/2017 season.India produced 28.3 million tonnes in the 2014/2015 season. It is too early to tell but most likely there will no decrease and no increase, Mr Sawhney said.Uttar Pradesh will most likely compensate for the drop in Maharashtra and Karnataka.The first back-to-back drought in nearly three decades has hit cane plantation in Indias key producing states Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.One Indian official previously estimated that the drop in plantings for the 2016/17 season means that acreage could fall by about a third after a faltering monsoon damaged thousands of hectares of cane in the worlds second-biggest producer.Mr Sawhney said India would meet its target of blending five per cent ethanol in all gasoline sold this sugar year for the first time and surpass it.We can cross five per cent ethanol blending.Oil companies have never met the current five per cent blending target as ethanol derived from molasses, the thick syrup produced by boiling down sugarcane juice in sugar refining, costs more than gasoline without including taxes.

Around 17 per cent said it was a hereditary condition they were suffering from, while 10 per cent of them believed it was due to lack of exercise and 5 per cent gave stress as a reason.The companys claims data also reiterated the same, showing that close to 25 per cent of the companys health claims came from this age group, Bajaj Allianz said. The survey also said most young professionals depend solely on employer-provided medical insurance and do not have a personal health insurance cover.Of the 75 per cent respondents who were health-insured, 60 per cent relied solely on employer-provided group cover.Among those who did not have health insurance, 46 per cent felt it was an expensive instrument and 22 per cent felt they were too young to invest in such a cover.Suresh Sugathan, Head (Health Insurance), Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said, Employer-provided medical policies are tailor-made plans for an organisation and are customised according to the benefits that the management wants to extend to its employees.At all times, the employer-provided cover might not meet your individual health insurance requirements in terms of coverage, number of dependents or family definition as well as your state of health, and might have certain limitations, he added.40% were plagued by chronic body pain (muscle spasms, jointpain, backache)"

Rajiv of starting an agitation against sugar factory owners and dropping it after receiving massive kickbacks from them, he surely did not expect what came his way as rebuttal.What proved his undoing was the fact that, in the heat of the moment, Mr. Bhima did not stop at making the accusation but went on to dare his successor to a public debate on the kickback issue. Mr. Rajiv, a former policeman known for his upright ways, decided to take him quite literally at his word.He set up a pandal in a public place in the constituency with an ornate chair bang in the middle of the dais with the name of Mr. Bhima stuck on it. He said he was all set for a public debate and his adversary could join him in the pandal at his leisure, seating himself on a chair next to the reserved place.Needless to say, the man who made the accusation never turned up.What ails Dakshina Kannada?Dakshina Kannada district is blessed with four modes of transport: road, rail, air, and sea. It has enterprising people, who not only excelled in India but also abroad. Still I wonder why it has not become the gateway for Karnataka, wondered Additional Chief Secretary and district in-charge Secretary Bharat Lal Meena at the Invest Dakshina Kannada Meet.It is not that Mr. Meena or anybody else in the government is unaware of the reasons. Though New Mangalore Port Trust could have acted as the gateway to Karnataka, the coastal region lacks proper road and rail network to connect to the hinterlands.Congress MLA and former bureaucrat J.R. Lobo did not miss the opportunity to say this loudly. Bengaluru [the government] does not have patience to listen to and redress our grievances.It is not just enough to hold investors meet; the government should also provide necessary infrastructure for the growth of industries. The government had formed an IT park in Mudipu (near Mangaluru). Except a few IT companies, none have bothered to open the shop there because the area lacks proper road connectivity, Mr. Lobo said.Bharathi Shipyard at Bengre, off Mangaluru, once employed 500 graduate engineers. Now the company is at the verge of shutdown. I approached many people, but none responded, he rued.Just provide us adequate power, sufficient water and proper roads. We will look after the rest and grow. Also ensure prevalence of law and order. When one intends to develop tourism industry, one would face CRZ problems and moral policing issues, Mr. Lobo said.MLA annoyedAll is not well in the Congress in Karnataka. Party MLAs and workers are frustrated over the delay in the appointment of members and directors to various State-run boards and corporations. Upset over the delay, S.T. Somashekhar, Congress MLA, dashed off a letter to the Chief Minister and requested him to fill vacancies before the ZP, TP polls. But the Chief Ministers reply was in the negative.He said appointments will be made only after the polls.The Yeshwantpur MLA urged KPCC president and Home Minister G. Parameshwara to convene the partys executive meeting to discuss the issue. Even after 30 months of the party coming to power, the leadership is still dilly-dallying in making these appointments. By doing so, hundreds of party workers who toiled for the partys growth are being denied opportunity. At least now, Mr. Siddaramaiah and Mr. Parameshwara should take note of the issue and do the needful. Appointments would make party cadre work more enthusiastically in the ensuing zilla and taluk panchayat elections, the MLA argued.Bageshree S.,Anil Kumar Sastry, andNagesh Prabhu"

Most of the times they make do with lesser, or even no medicine, worsening their condition,"" added Sarda, who also runs Udaan, a NGO that helps 400 underprivilaged diabetic children.She was speaking at a workshop organised to create awareness about management of type-1 diabetes and also to mark World Insulin Day on Sunday at Bhausaheb Chauhan hall here.""Since insulin is a lifesaving drug the state government should follow the lead of Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Goa and make them available at all government healthcare centres,"" she said.She further added that glucometer strips required to monitor blood sugar levels should also be made available free of cost to underprivileged patients.Earlier, the Aurangabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and the physicians' association had jointly urged chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to provide insulin free of cost to diabetics across the state on the lines of TB drugs.

They want Rs. 3,600 a tonne. However, a section of growers are happy that the government announced the SAP without succumbing to pressure tactics of sugar mills.The Centre had fixed the Fair and Remunerative Price for cane procured during the 2015-16 season at Rs. 2,300 a tonne. The State government declared an incentive of Rs. 550 including transportation charges of Rs. 100 a tonne, for a total State Advised price of Rs. 2,850.Though all public sector and most of the cooperative sector sugar mills had paid money for suppliers last year, private mills had piled up arrears on incentive to farmers for the cane supplied over the past two years. It is close to Rs. 950 crore. Under these circumstances, the Chief Minister has announced the SAP. We wonder whether the growers will get any benefit. We look up to her to ensure that, says president of Pettaivaithalai Cane Growers Association, Tiruchi, K. Anbalagan.Adverse market conditions have forced the sugar mills to default on payment to suppliers. Though the SAP announcement is welcome, only removal of Value Added Tax on sugar and reduction of VAT on its by products will help mills turn profitable and facilitate payment to farmers. The Chief Minister must help growers in asking the mills to pay the current dues and arrears in one go , according to the State technical secretary of Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations G. Ajeethan of Namakkal.Claiming that the cost of cultivation has gone up , general secretary of Federation of Farmers Associations in Delta Districts Arupathy P.

The district administration, sources said, has made it clear to the mills that 85 per cent of the turnover they make must be utilised for paying farmers for their produce, and utilise only the remaining for administrative expenses.The SAP inclusive of transport charge has been fixed out of political compulsion ahead of Assembly elections. The announcement in the backdrop of the Government's failure to secure the arrears of SAP announced last year from the mills has accentuated anger of the farming community, K.V. Ponnaiyan, president of Tamil Nadu Swadeshi Farmers Association said.The SAP arrears runs into several hundreds of crores of rupees, Mr. Ponnaiyan said.According to officials, even State-owned cooperatives have not been able to pay the SAP in entirety as stagnancy in price of sugar has been caused by oversupply.Meanwhile, the Sathyamangalam-based sugar mill that was issued notice based on complaint from farmers that it had refused to pay even the FRP, has cleared the balance dues as on December 31, 2015.The mill was said to have procured cane for Rs. 2,000 per tonne, out of which Rs. 92.80 was deducted as transport charge, resulting in payment of around Rs. 1,900, which was nearly Rs. 400 lesser than the FRP specification.Payment of FRP being a must under the Sugar Control Act, the district administration has been under pressure to exercise the Revenue Recovery Act to ensure prompt payment to farmers by the mills."

The work of laying the new BG track commenced in 1996-97 at an estimated cost of Rs. 229.88 crore and the project was completed in 2013 at a total cost of Rs. 750 crores. The line covered a distance of 85 km.A majority of the railway stations such as Rasipuram, Namakkal, Mohanur, Vangal on this section are elevated stations. Mallur and the two halt stations of Puduchathiram and Laddivadi are the other stations on this section.The major stations of Namakkal, Rasipuram and Mohanur have spacious car parking lots.The other facilities available in these stations are ramps for differently abled, sub-ways connecting main entrance with the platforms, waiting halls with adequate seating arrangements, toilets, approach roads and disaster management boards prominently displaying the emergency phone numbers, hospital phone numbers and distance from the station, and mobile numbers of members of service organisations.The Namakkal and Rasipuram railway stations have mini-reverse osmosis plants and water coolers.

At present, 2,000 bundles of 10 sugar canes each could be harvested from one acre, officials said. On an average, sugar canes grown on eight to nine acres were needed to meet the total cane demand. The total expenditure for procurement of sugar cane would be around Rs. 25 lakh as the procurement price for this season was hovering between Rs. 160 and Rs. 180 a bundle. But it could go up further in the days to come, they said.To finalise the procurement, the district administration had decided to constitute a committee, comprising the Collector, Joint Registrar of Cooperatives and Joint Director of Agriculture as per government guidelines.The officials were thinking over whether to procure sugar canes from one place or many places. Procuring sugar canes from one place and sending them to all ration shops in the district would involve huge freight charges. Quality, thickness and length of canes would vary from field to field, and it would mar distribution of sugar canes of uniform size and quality.When Theni district administration launched distribution of Pongal gift hampers containing sugar cane pieces among other things at Kodangipatti on Thursday, the officials managed to procure sugar canes from farms in Chinnamanur. The committee would decide on procurement, the officials added.Dindigul district administration too has been facing a similar problem.

Palanisamy of Sivagiri complained that the sugar factory in their area was yet to settle arrears to the tune of Rs. 9.80 crore to farmers since 2013.The Collector should initiate immediate steps for early disbursal of arrears, Mr. Palanisamy said.Kasi Viswanathan of the CPI said that farmers, who had taken temple lands on lease for farming, were being coerced by the HR and CE department and police officials even after lease amount had been paid.Rejecting the receipts as fake, the police, on receiving complaints from temple authorities, arrest the farmers. How is it possible for farmers to print receipts in a uniform fashion? Hence, the Collector should stop this nagging practice of harassing farmers, Mr. Kasi Viswanathan said."

Of course, the going is tough, so I have to work extra hard to make out a living selling the candy by finding new areas where demand will be there.For that, I try to travel mostly to different semi-urban and rural areas and sometimes to urban localities too where the children might not have heard or seen this candy much. They will then buy the candy mostly out of curiosity of seeing the pasty candy brought on a stick been made into the shapes of animals and flowers in front of them. This innovative market penetration is keeping my business going, Mr .Velumani said. He sells the candy in various sizes for a unit price of Rs. 5 to Rs. 15.On how he got attached to the sales, I have been doing some casual labour 20 years back. During that time, I happened to travel to a place near Mysuru 20 years ago where I came across a person who prepares this candy and learned the tricks from him, he said. On very lucrative business days, he makes profit of around Rs. 1,000."

Yeddyurappa getting Rs. 1-crore luxury SUV from party colleague Murugesh Nirani, whose sugar factory has defaulted on dues of more than Rs. 100 crore towards farmers, has not gone well with the Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association.Mr. Yeddyurappa should show his commitment to farmers by immediately directing Mr. Nirani to sell the luxury SUV, which has been bought in the name of his company, and settle the dues of at least a few farmers from that money, association president Kurubur Shanthkumar told The Hindu . Expressing dissatisfaction over Mr. Yeddyurappa accepting such a luxury car from Mr. Nirani, he said: We want leaders like Mr. Yeddyurappa, who heads the Opposition party, to be aggressive with industrialists who default on farmers dues by colluding with the government. If Mr. Yeddyurappa accepts the luxury SUV from Mr. Nirani now, he will not be in a position to rein in him if he (Yeddyurappa) becomes Chief Minister later, Mr. Shanthkumar said.He said the association was considering moving the court against Mr. Niranis sugar factory for its failure to pay dues towards farmers though he has money to spend on luxury cars. According to sources, Nirani Sugars is yet to clear dues of Rs. 197.57 crore to sugarcane growers for the crushing season 201516 and another Rs. 18.38 crore for 201314.We want leaders like Yeddyurappa to be aggressive with industrialists who default on farmers dues by colluding with the govt.Kurubur Shanthkumar,Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association president"

The bribe-giver was punished in Italy. But we will punish the people who received the illegal money in India, he said. People of Tamil Nadu were tired of giving money for water connections, building approvals and jobs, he noted. He made a promise that he would get permission to conduct jallikattu and rekla race. When the matter comes up for hearing in the Supreme Court in July, we will present our case in the court and get permission to conduct jallikattu next year. Only the UPA government banned it, he said.Assam had decided to bring about a change and the BJP would come to power. Tamil Nadu too wanted good, corruption-free governance and people expected a decent and dignified life. Seventy per cent of the people below the age of 50 years in the State had seen only the DMK and the AIADMK. When you are angry with the DMK you elect the AIADMK, and repeat it again and again. This time you select the party you like, he advised. The AIADMK attached stickers on everything provided under Central schemes. If the Tamil Nadu government wanted to do good to farmers, they should procure coconut oil and supply it through ration shops. Both AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa and DMK chief Karunanidhi had promised prohibition now. But both parties had been supporting liquor barons. Sugarcane growers in other States had been converting ethanol into fuel. But in Tamil Nadu, sugar factories were not allowed to sell it to the Centre and forced to sell it to liquor factories, he added."

Under The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, a promoter cannot accept more than 10 per cent of the cost of an apartment, plot or building as an advance payment or application fee without first entering into a written agreement for sale with such a person and register the agreement for sale.He said as housing societies developed plots, money was pooled by the people to purchase land. With the new Bill, it will be difficult to proceed with the project with just 10 per cent from buyers. So we hope for an amendment, or else it will create a problem for us. We want this to stay under our own Act.Dues cleared by sugar factoriesReferring to the dues owed by sugar factories to farmers, the minister said that 46 out of 66 sugar factories, which had to clear dues for the last three years, had already paid up. We had issued a circular stating that those companies who paid the dues would be given exemption from road tax and purchase cess. After this, many companies cleared the dues. About `193 crore had to be paid to the farmers, he said. The remaining 20 factories who have not cleared the dues will not be given the exemption, he added.A shortfall in the production of sugarcane is expected this year. We produced 376 lakh tonnes of sugarcane last year. This year, we are expecting only 300 lakh tonnes and the factories have to manage with this, Prasad added.Dasara meetingChief Minister Siddaramaiah will chair a high-level meeting on Thursday to discuss the modalities for the Dasara festival in Mysuru."

The survey showed the SP lagging behind the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party.While Mr. Yadav, speaking a few days ago, downplayed the significance of the survey, the Opposition parties have used it to target the ruling party. BSP chief Mayawati said the opinion poll reflected peoples sentiment.In his address at Azamgarh, Mr. Singh praised the SP government for fulfilling the promises made to voters and assured the people that the remaining work would also be completed soon. Terming Azamgarh auspicious for his party, Mr. Singh said whenever he had started the election campaign from the district, his party had emerged victorious.After winning the seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SP chief made his first visit to Azamgarh in February last year, when he inaugurated development projects worth Rs. 1,987 crore. Carrying on from that, on Tuesday, the Chief Minister, in the presence of his father, inaugurated 38 projects and laid the foundation stone of 35 projects worth Rs. 665 crore. Important among them was the inauguration of the multi-facility Sathiaon sugar mill and co-generational plant worth Rs. 333 crore.The talking point of the Azamgarh trip was the display of bonhomie between Amar Singh and the SP chief. While the party has remained mum, speculation is rife that Mr. Amar Singh could play a key role in the SPs campaign in 2017. The two leaders flew together to Azamgarh from Lucknow.Amar Singhs presence has given rise to speculation he may play a key role in 2017 polls"

Vyapari log bhi thora idhar udhar karte hain.Lekin hum kisi ki jaan nahi lete. (See, corruption exists here too. Businessmen too resort to some trading malpractices.But we do not kill people),"" says an angry Sharma referring to the flyover crash last month that claimed 26 lives.Jorasanko in the heart of Kolkata was as corrupt as the rest of 293 constituencies. But that was till the morning of March 31 when a portion of the under-construction Vivekananda Road flyover came crashing down. Within hours, alleged links of the Bakshi family with the sub-standard construction started emerging adding to the anger of the local people. ""This is the first time that we have seen that corruption can claim lives.This has scared all of us,"" said Bajrang, Mahesh's son.If such conversations among her voters are a cause of concern for Trinamool's Smita Bakshi, the crowd Ra hul Sinha, her political opponent from the BJP , is drawing is no less worrisome. His political meetings are drawing people and road shows are witnessing a surge of supporters. The location of the now infamous flyover is in the hub of BJP bastion Jorasanko has the largest concentration of business and trading community people in Bengal. The rest around the city either have business interest in the area or an emotional connection.The crash coupled with the Bakshi families ""disrepute"" has added to the people's anger even in the portion where Muslim votes are critical.Sources in Trinamool admitted that they were aware that a split in minority votes was inevitable but nobody , not even people in BJP , is willing to concede that Rahul can claim a big chunk of the 40,000-strong Mus lim votes across the constituency . At best, he can manage to divide the vote bank.""Even if Sinha manages to get 10% of the Muslim votes, he will sail through,"" said a senior leader of Trinamool in Burrabazar.These findings have made Sinha desperate to woo the mi nority voters of this constituency . From Rajabazar to Zakaria Street to Kalabagan to Marcus Square -areas with high minority concentration -the BJP candidate is leaving no stone unturned, even scheduling at least one meeting everyday in these areas.""There are localities including wards like 37,38,39, 41and 43 where BJP could never do street corner meetings. This time locals are inviting the candidate to do meetings,"" said Narayan Sharma, treasure of the Jorasanko mandal.Sensing the Opposition's efforts to make inroads into the Muslim belts, Trinamool has turned to another M factor -the strong Marwari community . But if the motley crowd in the meeting of Trinamool's biggest star -Mamata Banerjee herself -at Satyanarayan Park is something to go by , the party is not breaking much ice with the community .""I have come here because of the tradition. Every chief minister comes to Burrabazar before the elections,"" Mamata said, her comment taking her party colleagues by surprise.""It seems that the party has given up on this seat,"" said another Trinamool leader who also belongs to the Marwari community . The other worry for Trinamool is the surge in BJP's support base and the uncertainty about the extent to which Sinha will increase BJP's vote. In 2014 election, Sinha was ahead of Trinamool by over 16,000 votes."

Mathura: Every day at 8 am, Jawahar Bagh Colony residents woke up to Netaji zindabad slogans and revolutionary songs such as Sankalpa hai shahidon ka. ""Morning alarm,"" says homemaker Premlata Sharma.From the rooftops of some colony homes, where government servants live, the view of the Jawahar Bagh is clear. Colony residents recall how the orchard gradually became home to protestors who conducted morning marches, peddled vegetables, spices, clothes and utensils at throwaway prices, who had solar panels, tractors, generators and ran their own kitchen.The squatters raised cattle, owned an atta-chakki and went to makeshift toilets. A witness said that though their huts looked ramshackle, they had neat interiors. SUVs such as Safaris and Fortuners drove in and out.Initially there were only a few dozen occupants but the numbers swelled to thousands. ""A bunch of 30-40 came on March 15, 2014. I heard they had permission to stay a couple of days. But they never left,"" says Premlata.She remembers the date because the next day was Holi. ""Slowly they grew in numbers and their behaviour changed for the worse. They menacingly pointed towards us with lathis and warned people to get off rooftops,"" she remembers.Another homemaker Kanchan Yadav says the squatters spoke a different language, not the local brajbhasha. ""They seemed to be from east UP,"" she said. Some were from Lakhimpur Kheri, or Balia and Ghazipur. A few were from Jhansi too.Sometimes the interaction between the squatters and the colonywallahs was positive. ""Once when they sold sugar for Rs 20 a kg, there were queues of buyers.""The occupants eventually had to wage a lengthy court battle with the district administration for the orchard. Things spun out of control on Thursday; two policemen, including an SP, and at least 22 squatters died.Witnesses claimed the shots fired by the occupants were accurate because they were aimed from trees where they had a clear view of the police. Jawahar Bagh is in the heart of Mathura's administrative district. Every government office is barely a few hundred metres from here.""Even a few days back, when the police asked them to vacate, they shouted back: himmat ho to karvai karo, yeh zameen hamari hai,"" another resident said.RELATED STORIESMathura incidentBACKGROUND X Buddhist monks roped in as PM Modi's messengers for UP assembly polls Monks in Nagpur's Deekshabhoomi.

""The PM suggested a debate on Ambedkar in Parliament, a coin was released commemorating Ambedkar... It must be brought to public knowledge how Modi ji has ensured due respect for Dr Ambedkar,"" he told TOI. RELATED STORIESBJP is attempting to reach out to DalitsNEW DELHI: Theunder the leadership of PM Narendra Modi by claiming successes on economic management and foreign policy fronts, issuing a call for the end of ""goonda raj"" in UP and hailing its recent win in Assam as an ""ideological"" victory.Thewill discuss the achievements of the Modi government to establish that critics who raised questions about the PM's lack of experience at the Centre have been proved wrong.As the party has been done in recent weeks, the executive will dwell on a comparison of the state of economy when the BJP assumed office and gains made since then. Similarly, the party will robustly pitch Modi's extensive foreign travel as a much needed initiative to restore India's image in keeping with its status of a fast growing economy.The executive's deliberations will see the party focus on Modi's leadership and the government's welfare initiatives like 'Jan Dhan' accounts, farm insurance, cheap medical stores, LPG for poor households and better governance.The meeting, which gets under way on Sunday evening, will see a sharp attack on the Samajwadi Party government for poor governance, including deteriorating law and order, in UP as BJP begins a long campaign ahead of assembly polls early next year.Thewhere police officers were killed in a bloody clash with squatters, BJP chief Amit Shah has already directly attacked SP leader Shivpal Yadav  a cousin of party patriarch Mulayam Singh  for patronising a 270-acre-land grab at the city's Jawahar Bagh.The stress on removing ""goonda raj"" is shorthand at challenging the alleged supremacy of SP's Yadav base while BJP is also targeting the state government for patronising anti-socials in a bid to woo minority votes.While declaring SP as the principal adversary in order to undercut Bahujan Samaj Party's 'main challenger' status,through demonstrative acts like party chief Amit Shah's dip with Dalit sants (holy men) at the Kumbh and yatras to woo scheduled castes, particularly those outside the Mayawati's ""chamar"" base.The recent poll victory in Assam, BJP's breakthrough moment in the north-east, will be celebrated as an ""ideological"" victory with the comprehensive win projected as a vindication of the party's campaign against illegal migrants from Bangladesh. The failure of Congress despite a large Muslim vote and BJP's success in making Assamese ""identity"" central to the election will find prominent mention.Likewise BJP's growing vote in Kerala and the presence it has established in West Bengal and even Tamil Nadu will point the way to further expansion.The Allahabad meet will see a sharp attack on the SP government for poor governance, including deteriorating law and order, in UP as BJP begins a long poll campaign."

While there is a childlike pleasure in its display with the 'lollipop'ish look of these bites of goodness that are served on a decorated skewer, rest assured, there is nothing childish about the dedos da dama . In fact, every bite of this dessert will ensure an exotic play of flavours and textures that your taste buds will revel in, be it the smoothness of the marzipan-like interiors with flavors like cashewnut and tender coconut coming through, or the crunch of that bitter sweet sugar caramel it is dipped in just before being served.""The dedos da dama is a Portuguese-origin dessert that would unfailingly be served at their parties along with a host of other Portuguese-origin sweets,"" recalls Ivo Coutinho, author of 'A day in the Goan kitchen'.What it is about this dessert that makes it such a hot favourite? Allwyn Fernandes of Joshila Caterers attributes it to the unique and delicate flavour combination of coconut and cashewnut.While its popularity remains intact  yes, in the times of cheesecakes and souffles, this dessert can definitely hold its own with these bites of goodness flying off the dessert table. And if you delay in serving yourself, there's quite a possibility that you may not get any at all  the number of people who can make an authentic dedos da dama is sadly declining. ""It is a slightly long and tedious process. Once the main mix is carefully cooked, it has to be rolled into bite-sized fingers and then mounted on decorated skewers. Also, the final step, the caramel it is dipped in, has to be done just before service or the caramel may melt and start dripping. But most caterers do not make it as they do not know the authentic process,"" says Anthony Pinto of Pinto Caterers.Fernandes says that while they still do get orders for the dessert, they are not as many as before. ""Everybody loves the dedos da dama , but the young generation has little knowledge of it,"" he says. ""Another factor that goes against its popularity is the cost, as this is one of the more expensive desserts,"" opines Coutinho."

But, it will be done soon, she added. Recording details will be useful for many purposes as consumers could ensure availability of ration products for them; prevent purchase by others using fake family cards and help taluk supply officers monitor the sale.

At present, paper bills, supplied by the cooperative department are provided to consumers, she said.Very soon the process of recording details will get completed and following it, it should be communicated to the government which will further decide about issuance of smart cards, Jeeva said."
58f2775da3d24b68099ade82,New markers to assess blood glucose,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/New-markers-to-assess-blood-glucose/articleshow/51886790.cms,2016-04-19,"Pune: For the first time, Indian researchers have found new variants of haemoglobin-based diagnostic markers that provide more reliable blood glucose levels of preceding three months and may also predict complications in diabetes more precisely than the existing methods.The research has opened up a host of possibilities and raised hopes as to whether their production can be blocked as these diagnostic markers have been found to have some co-relation in advancing diabetes and its complications and if so, could this prevent diabetic complications.The collaborative research of Pune-based National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Chellaram Diabetes Institute, was recently published in a peer-reviewed medical journal called Clinical Proteomics.In diabetes, haemoglobin - a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen - is coated with sugar and it is termed as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).The glycation theory suggests that glucose attaches to proteins in the blood, plasma, eye and kidney and heart and nerves or their blood vessels cause diabetic complications.Currently, N-1-(Deoxyfructosyl) valine (DFV) -hemoglobin (-Hb), commonly referred as HbA1c, is widely used diagnostic marker in diabetes. It is believed to provide glycemic status of preceding 90-120 days.When broadly looked at, in general terms, the research argues that though HbA1c is glycated haemoglobin - but it is still not a sufficiently advanced glycated product to precisely predict diabetic complications.""Carboxyethyl (CEV) and carboxymethyl (CMV) form of hemoglobin are more advanced glycated products. We have found that they can predict complications better,"" lead researcher Mahesh Kulkarni, biochemical division at CSIR-NCL told TOI.Kulkarni said, ""This is the first study that describes detailed characterisation and quantification of advanced glycated peptides of haemoglobin including CMV and CEV peptides of HbA1c.""""Since advanced glycation modifications are associated with diabetic complications, the quantification of these peptides may be more meaningful in the evaluation of glycemic status in diabetes. In addition, CMV and CEV show better correlation with severity of diabetes,"" he added.The researchers have measured these products in blood and found some correlation with advancing diabetes and its complications.But can this replace HbA1c? ""Our study report is a proof of concept paper. Long term studies are required to establish these markers at clinical level,"" said endocrinologist A G Unnkrishnan of Chellaram Diabetes Institute whose team led the clinical aspects of the research.If these advanced glycated products do predict complications ( as they indicate tissue glycation too), could their production or glycation be blocked - and if so could this prevent diabetic complications too ?""This is a somewhat futuristic, maybe too futuristic a form of thinking - yet novel and different from the usual Indian research in diabetes,"" Unnikrishnan said.Other researchers who are part of the study include Mashanipalya G Jagdeeshprasad, Kedar Batkulkar, Nishita Meshram, Shalbha Tiwari and Arvind Korwar.""The research appears to be very promising. It needs to be critically assessed in prospective studies to evaluate its utility in clinical practise,"" said senior diabetologist C S Yajnik of KEM hospital."

While other villages in the arid Ahmednagar district are digging borewells even up to 400 feet, the underground water table in Hiware Bazar is so good that the precious commodity is available barely 20 to 40 feet below. Though the village has banned water-guzzling cash crops like sugarcane and banana, farmers here are still far richer than their counterparts in the region. For the record, no family is below the poverty line.Hiware Bazar, now a byword for watershed management and water conservation, had found special mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Mann ki Baat' programme on Sunday. ""People in this village have done exemplary work,"" Modi had said. Village sarpanch Popatrao Pawar, who has been specially invited by Modi for a cup of tea, said, "" We are glad that our efforts are being recognised."" The road to shaping the village to be self-sufficient has been a long and arduous one. Like any other village in the region, Hiware Bazar used to face a major water crisis each year because of the measly 200-300 mm rainfall it gets. ""We kicked off our water conservation efforts in 1994-95. Various watershed management programmes and water conservation initiatives were started. But we realised that this alone was not going to help. So we decided to choose a cropping pattern,"" Pawar told TOI. The village decided to shun water-intensive crops and opted for vegetables , fruits, flowers and pulses. Dairy development was encouraged. ""We resolved that no borewell would be dug in the village and that every drop of water would be used cautiously. We have a water budget. The villagers meet on December 31 each year, during which a review of the rainfall and available water is taken. We then decide which crops can be grown in the next season. In fact, we decided to take a break from farming this year as there was no rain. The villagers reaped the last kharif crop and have stopped farming for the last four or five months since then,"" he said.Mohan Chattar, a villager, said taking a break from farming did not affect earnings. ""The daily collection of milk in the village is itself about 4,000 litres. Dairy farming brings in good money. There is also enough fodder here,"" he said. The village has a rule that no resident can sell his or her land to an outsider. ""People from other villages migrate in search of jobs, particularly during tough times like these. However, the case is quite the opposite here. Around 40 families have returned to the village from cities over the last few years,"" another villager said.The villagers are not resting on their laurels and are already chalking out a ten-year plan. ""Water scarcity is going to worsen. As part of our ten-year plan, we will opt for growing pulses and oilseed crops and brand them. This will not only boost our earnings but also help save water,"" Pawar said.Pawar is unwilling to blame the poor monsoon for water scarcity. ""It is lack of vision and discipline that brings about scarcity and drought,"" he said. Politics is a strict no-no in Hiware Bazar. ""There is neither politics nor liquor shops in the village. Both intoxicate and destroy development,"" said Chattar."

""Because of their lethargy and apathy, we have to suffer. Serious health issues have cropped up,because of this polluted water,"" she said.The Mula and Mutha rivers are among 302 polluted river stretches in the country identified by the Central Pollution Control Board.

""In rural Solapur, there are no water treatment plants. Ujani water reaches some districts through canals and lift irrigation schemes and people drink untreated water,"" journalist Suryakant Asabe said.Residents of Solapur have demanded that the state government must take strict action against Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).State environment minister Ramdas Kadam recently told the state assembly that the government has registered a case against PMC commissioner for not taking action against those who are polluting Bhima river. ""In the next five years, the government plans to set up a river purification plant worth Rs 990 crore to revive Bhima. The state will convene a meeting of PMC and PCMC officials within a month The government has taken serious note of Bhima pollution,"" he said.

They take dam water to the village well and from there, it is distributed to villagers. The situation is serious as people frequently suffer from gastro and other problems,"" said Bramha Chatte from Mohal taluka of Solapur district.Pune municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar said the Centre has signed a loan agreement with Japan International Cooperation Agency to abate pollution in Mula and Mutha rivers. under the National River Conservation Plan. The components proposed under the project includes construction of 11 sewage treatment plants. which would result in the creation of an additional treatment capacity of 396 MLD over the existing treatment capacity of 477 MLD. The project would also focus on laying 113.6km of sewer lines and renovation and rehabilitation of four existing intermediate pumping stations. Once it is done, the sewage treatment capacity in Pune would be 873 MLD, sufficient to cater to the sewage generation of 2027, he said.GraphicsDOWN THE DRAIN AND INTO HOMES* Rivers flowing in Pune district have earned the dubious distinction of being the most polluted in the state* A Central Pollution Control Board study shows that Bhima river, which has Mula, Mutha, Pavana and Indrayani as its tributaries, was polluted* A recent water quality report also found the Bhima upper sub-basin the most polluted in Maharashtra and put the water quality in 'bad to very bad' category* The coliform content of Bhima river is quite high.

Several steps have already been taken in this regard. We are not interfering in lending and personnel matters of the banks. Structural issues have been addressed in various sectors like power, coal, highways, sugar and steel.The banks are putting in special efforts to effect recoveries with a focus on reviving stalled projects.For speedier resolution of stressed assets, the Debt Recovery Tribunals will be strengthened with focus on improving the existing infrastructure, including computerised processing of court cases, to support reduction in the number of hearings and faster disposal of cases, he said.Mr Jaitley said the state-owned banks should be strong and competitive. The Bank Board Bureau will be operationalised during 2016-17 and a roadmap for consolidation of public sector banks will be spelt out. The process of transformation of IDBI Bank has already started. Government will take it forward and also consider the option of reducing its stake to below 50 per cent.On Sunday, the government had announced the setting up of Bank Board Bureau, headed by former comptroller general of accounts, Vinod Rai. The four-member BBB is independent of government and Reserve Bank of India.The BBB is a crucial step because once it becomes operational, the government can distance itself from the process of appointments of chief executives and board members in this bank. Such a move was originally proposed by the P.J. Nayak Committee which was set up by RBI governor.Analysts were disappointed that the government had not increased the amount for capital infusion in public sector banks.Capital infusion in public sector banks was kept unchanged at Rs 25,000 crore. Since bad loans have increased substantially in Oct-Dec quarter, following the Asset Quality Review of RBI, and expected to go up further, bankers expected between Rs.10,000 crore to Rs.15,000 crore additional capital infusion in 2016-17.Although the FM did reiterate the Governments commitment to the PSU Banks, the Budget has restricted the allocation for Bank recapitalization at the Rs. 25,000 crore that was announced in the Indradhanush, despite the rise in provisioning post Banks Q3FY16 results, said Naresh Takkar, MD & Group CEO, ICRA Ltd.The limited focus on the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund for funding investments is another key disappointment, he added.For speedier resolution of stressed assets, the Debt Recovery Tribunals will be strengthened"

Experts attribute it to the use of bleaching agent sodium hydrogen sulphate to produce bright-coloured jaggery. Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) does not allow jaggery with more than 70 PPM for export.ModernisationHowever, with jaggery commanding a higher price sometimes and the growing preference for it by the health conscious provides an opportunity for producing export quality jaggery.While sugar contains 99.9 per cent sucrose, jaggery comprises sucrose, glucose, fructose, Vitamins A, B and E and is rich in iron and calcium, according to agricultural scientists. Steam boiling is a step towards modernisation of jaggery-making. In steam boiling, the entire heating using bagasse is done outside and water is converted into steam heating the sugarcane solution, says P.V.K. Jagannadha Rao, principal scientist, All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology Centre at ANGRAU Regional Agricultural Research Station, Anakapalle.The system is developed under the AICRP project.It keeps out the dust and particles of bagasse finding their way into the juice being boiled for jaggery.It saves about 17 to 20 per cent of time and gives 20 to 30 per cent better quality jaggery, says Mr. Jagannadha Rao.The boiler system costs Rs.10 lakh and the pay back period is two years and two months, he says.While 250 kg of jaggery a day is made using the traditional system in and around Ankapalle and about 500 kg in the Godavari districts, the boiler gives one tonne of production, he says.It also suits sugar factories planning to divert into jaggery making and those who want to produce granulated jaggery, Mr. Jagannadha Rao elaborates.Three-pan systemDuring a recent State-level farmers' meeting, advantages of the three-pan furnace developed by the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow and the rotating filtration system developed by AICRP Centre, Kolhapur, were explained to farmers.The three-pan system has better heating process, pipes for transferring liquid from one pan to the other and mechanical emptying of the concentrated liquid. An experienced farmer from Nellore, Babu Rao, however, differed with the estimate that each cycle would produce 100 kg and said only 50 kg would be made. The filtration system will reduce scum by 80 per cent and improve quality of jaggery, according to Dr. Rao."

Hes also made his Bollywood directorial debut recently with crime thriller Missing On A Weekend .Thats a lot to begin with! But hes slowly recovering from the mayhem, far away from Mumbai. Since 2012, Ive been writing scripts for myself, says Jawkar. But something I read about a German tourist being raped in Goa triggered off this particular script that ended up as Missing On A Weekend .I felt this thriller should be the first film I make, not a typical love story. He adds, This is also a commercial film. In the 110 minutes, Ive managed four songs too [one of which he has written]. I believe that a filmmaker should enjoy watching his own film. Jawkar admits he only watches typical Bollywood masala films.The film also had a run-in with the censor board. Jawkar says that CBFC initially asked (verbally) for 50 cuts with an A certificate while he was expecting a U/A certification. He ultimately received a list of seven cuts to be made after he slapped a legal notice on the Board.It all began when the films trailer was released and had a line that said Goa is the New Delhi for crime. The PR team of the Goa Tourism Board apparently got in touch with the CBFC asking all references to Goa to be cut because it would spoil the image of the State. People like us, we back off after our job is done, says the director.The funny thing is before you shoot in Goa you have to submit a synopsis to their film society seeking permission. We had got a clearance and we even shot for seven days in the Calangute police station! With the kind of cuts suggested, my film will become a web series! He has now appealed to the revising committee. Of course, all this has meant that the release date has been pushed further. Planning a film release date is like planning your wedding! Right now there are too many big films coming out, says Jawkar. So my film will be released on August 26.Missing On A Weekend is also the debut film for Karan Hariharan, son of ghazal and Bollywood playback singer Hariharan. Jawkar knew Hariharan and had met his son at a time when the young boy weighed over 100 kilos. Two years later, Karan was half his size. It was a surprise audition that landed him the role, says Karan. Versatile actor Pawan Malhotra essays the role of a cop in the film.Jawkar, an economics graduate, says he was an aimless kid in college pretty clueless about what he would do once he finished. I wanted to go to Australia or the U.K. to do an MBA and have a good time, he laughs. A friend who had seen him do event management in his college days set him up in a film production company. Here, Jawkar started at the very bottom, buying film reels and worked his way up to making documentaries for Fox Entertainment and History channels.Then he got an opportunity to invest in film distribution with Singham . When you make good money on your first project, you keep going! he says. Jawkar went on to distribute a host of films including Yamudu , Golimaar and the Telugu dubbed versions of the Harry Potter series.Then Jawkar set up production house Red Bulb Studios two years ago and co-produced Marathi films Dabba Ais Pais and Sugar , Salt Ani Prem . Hes now working on a script for a friend on a Marathi film and hoping to start filming his second Hindi film, a women-centric one by December 2016.Jawkar started at the bottom, buying film reels, and went on to make documentaries for Fox Entertainment"

Though Karnataka and Maharashtra saw a decline in sugar output, the situation does not warrant imports. We will start the next season with adequate supply, he said.The Centre has withdrawn the production-linked subsidy for sugar exports. This is an ill-timed move, he said. Global production is likely to fall by five per cent to 10 per cent next season. Exports are not much now because the Indian prices are not attractive in the international market. But, such a move affects the sentiment of the industry.The sugar industry is suffering for the last three years due to drought, high cane price, and cost of production. The domestic prices were at Rs. 2,000 a quintal as against the production cost of Rs. 3,400 a quintal.Now, prices have improved to Rs. 3,300 to Rs. 3,400 a quintal.

The traders body has been demanding imposition of unitary tax instead of 5 per cent VAT on food items.Of the 29 States, 25 have no tax on food items. Odisha is a consuming State. Importing these items entails a freight cost of 5 to 7 per cent and after adding 5 per cent VAT, it becomes a cost burden of 12 per cent on the customer, said FAOTA secretary Sudhakar Panda.Claiming that the government is also not getting the amount of revenue it should get on the basis of 5 per cent VAT, Mr. Panda said the State is getting only one-tenth of the revenue its supposed to get.About 90 per cent of the revenue which should have come to government coffers is lost to unscrupulous traders. Then in whose interest is this 5 per cent VAT being levied, Mr. Panda asked, adding that their agitation is against this faulty taxation system in the State.FAOTA had earlier threatened to stop import of such items in June 2015 following which the State government had formed a committee to resolve the issue within three months.Now, FAOTA said, it has been forced to take the extreme step since the government failed to take any action in this matter.Meanwhile, State Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma said he would attend a meeting convened by the State Finance Minister to resolve the issue. - PTI"

In some cases, the lease period needs to be extended before the lease expires.The governments amendment, in laymans terms, means that land from the second category can now easily be transferred to the first, giving the occupant complete ownership.This is in favour of the users. At a time when we are talking about increasing investment in industrial sector, we need to amend laws in business friendly manner. Now people do not need to visit government offices to renew lease agreement. They can own it now, said Manu Kumar Srivastava, Principle Secretary, Revenue Department.While the amendment was pending with the government for the last many years, a number of suggestions including bringing lease rates closer to market rates instead of transferring ownership were also pending with the government.The state has clarified that details such as transfer fee, terms and conditions and process will be finalised in the act that will come up in the budget session.Land held by the occupants can now be movedto full ownership category"

Its not easy for her. A mother is prone to physical and psychological stress. While the awareness is increasing, some lactating mothers tend to pick up the milk powder that is bought well in advance even before the problems begin.According to UNICEF, 1.5 million babies around the world, across communities, die of diarrhoea every year. The cause? Bottle and formula feeding. In India especially, despite oral rehydration treatment and antibiotics, diarrhoea continues to be an important cause of infant mortality.City Express had a chat with doctors to find out about health and other non-health related problems that moms face. For first-time mothers, its the most difficult. How to breastfeed, the position, the dos and donts, the problems they can encounterwhat they need is proper post-labour counselling, said Dr Madhuri Prabu, neonatal paediatrician, Motherhood Hospital. Nipple fissures, flat nipples, insufficient milk and difficulty in latching on are some of the most common reasons why women choose milk powder and feeding bottles. Now, sometimes, they cant help it. The real problem arises when they get addicted to it, the easy way.A baby needs nothing (including water, vitamins or ayurvedic preparations) except breast milk for the first six months of its life. Anything besides breast milk may be harmful. This brings us to the social custom of feeding infants sugar water or honey for the first two days of its life. This custom is not followed much but a few drops are still being given as the first intake. Though a couple of doctors denied the practice, we spoke to many mothers who say that they still follow it.Deepika, an educated, upper-middle class woman said, Yes, my son was given drops of honey as part of a ritual. I did not stop them for two reasons. One, I had a ceaserian and was not aware of what was going on. Two, I didnt mind. It was just a few drops and my son (now two years old) is healthy. Two other women, one from a lower socio-economic status accepted the practice of giving honey drops to newborn.So, isnt it harmful? Though warnings are given, Dr R Kondammal, gynaecologist, Apollo Hospitals, said, No harmful effects are noted these days because they only give a few drops. Similarly, gripe water is also neither good nor bad. We havent seen any harmful effects. In fact, in some cases, it actually helps soothe the infant.Kondammal also said that breastfeeding must not be stopped before six months. Out of 10 mothers, five come with breastfeeding problems. What Ive noticed is that people from the middle and upper classes opt for formula feed as its much easier and less time-consuming. Milk powder does not contain immunoglobulins, which is secreted by breast milk; it cannot protect the baby from diseases.Many would consider malnutrition to be the root cause but Dr Vasanthamani, dean, Villupuram Medical College, has a different perspective. Handling patients with rural background, she said, Malnutrition is not the main problem anymore. Apart from calcium and Vitamin D3 deficiency, its the psychological issues faced by mothers, working women and also young moms. Young mothers? Yes, in earlier times, women got married at the age of 21 or 22 but now slowly in villages, women are again getting married as early as 16 when their body is not ready to take up social and family responsibilities. We are focusing on specific issues now as lack of general awareness is decreasing.In cities, working women are at a bigger disadvantage because of low maternity leave. Many are neither comfortable leaving their child at creches nor can they afford to take LOP (loss of pay). Dr Madhuri advises women to come home during lunch, breastfeed throughout the night or use a local breastfeed milk bank. Every little time counts. The worst decision would be to stop breastfeeding altogether.According to a study by All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Indian Council of Medical Research, working mothers who yield to shorter periods of breastfeeding have higher vulnerability to breast and ovarian cancer. In India, breast cancer rates have relatively been low in the past but with the changing lifestyles, there has been a sudden increase in cases among females.Dr Kondammal added, Short time period of breastfeeding increases estrogen exposure to breast. Hence, the increased risk of breast cancer.UNICEF states that in India between 2006 and 2013, there has been an improvement in the breastfeeding rates. The latest data show that 44.6% children are put to breastfeeding within one hour of birth and 64.9% children under six months of age are exclusively breastfed. A 70-year-old domestic maid said she understood the importance of breastmilk. Although I never gave milk powder, there were other practices we followed that I realise now were wrong.Another woman, in her 50s told us how they had stopped throwing away the sticky discharge from the breast (colostrums) and instead fed it to the baby. During those days, we were taught to consider colostrums bad but now we know how important it is. Colustrum contains immunoglobulins and anti-infective cells that protect the newborn against common infections and allergies.Awareness is definitely increasing and its always reassuring to see older women accept the changing mindset."

The farmers registered their opposition to the proposal in the meeting.The farmers demanded that the government resume production at MPM at the earliest and direct the management to purchase the sugarcane. In case of delay, the government should purchase the sugarcane through MPM and sell it to other sugar factories. The farmers also demanded issuance of bills towards purchase of sugarcane in the name of MPM, Mr. Eranna said.He said that sugarcane was cultivated in 3,700 acres in the district, of which a major chunk was under the ratooning cultivation method. The total production of sugarcane was estimated at 1.6 lakh tonne. All these years, MPM purchased sugarcane from farmers for its sugar generation unit through buyback agreement. The halting of production at MPM had created confusion among farmers. The farmers were also hesitant of entering into an agreement with private sugar factories at this juncture, Mr. Eranna said."

During summer, the farmers transplanted paddy in only 7,564 hectares against the target of 20,000 hectares. Likewise, they cultivated ragi in 1,984 hectares (target-3,000 hectares), maize in 262 (target-500) and pulses in 386 hectares (target-750).The percentage of transplanting paddy seedlings is just 37.8, a senior officer at the department said. The cultivation of paddy, one of the prime crops in the district, has fallen by 62.2 per cent. Likewise, ragi cultivation has dipped by 33.9 per cent.The cultivation of oil seed has been badly hit across the district with farmers not coming forward to take up cultivation of sunflower and groundnut. The target fixed by the department during the summer season was 100 hectares.In contrast, in spite of haunting issues such as non-operation of sugar mills and non-clearance of dues, sugarcane cultivation has crossed the target [of 2,000 hectares] with growers taking up cane cultivation in 3,100 hectares. The percentage of cane cultivation in the district is 155.5, the officer said.All seven taluks in the district are reeling under severe drought. Issues such as scanty rainfall, declining water level in Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) reservoir and agrarian crisis has prompted the farmers to stay away from cultivation activities, the officer added."

The season started in November last year and will be over by April.The factories have produced 97.6 lakh tonne of sugar so far from the crushing of sugarcane. Shri Tatyasaheb Kore Warna Cooperative Sugar Factory has crushed 8.18 lakh sugarcane. The figures are up to January 26.Sachin Raval, joint commissioner of sugar, Kolhapur said, ""The factories are crushing sugarcane rapidly so that recovery will remain high.

The area under cane cultivation has jumped to 148% taking total cultivation area to 1.74 lakh hectares. Between November and December last year, sugarcane plantation was increased on 28,728 hectares.The cultivation clearly indicates that the farmers have paid no heed to the water resource department appeal to not opt for the water-guzzling and cash crop this year amid worst monsoon in years. As per the agriculture department data, the district has received 634.9 mm rain till October 15 against an average of 1,772.4 mm.Already 1.45 lakh sugarcane is under cultivation in 2014-15 and district administration, district unit of water resources department and agriculture department were expecting the trend to decline this year. However, the areas such as Hatkanangale, Shirol and Kagal, where the rainfall was lowest, have cultivated sugarcane on 10,000 to 4,500 hectares.Traditionally, sugarcane farming is an on-going process as farmers use three methods such as alternative year cultivation, pre-season and on-going season cultivation. In the recent report, generated by the collector office on December 1, the pre-seasonal cultivation has reached 1.63 lakh hectares.

A GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities that are unique to that origin. Two organisations - Lotus Progressive Centre, Nalbari, and Centre for Environment Education (CEE), Guwahati - recently submitted additional documents to the Intellectual Property India (IPI) office in Chennai to get a GI tag for boka saul, a soft variety of rice. The two organisations had applied for the GI tag last year. Tapan Baishya, secretary of Lotus Progressive Centre, said they recently submitted additional information on the paddy's historical background, area were it is grown and logo, among others, with the assistance of Assam Science, Technology and Environment Council (ASTEC). Baishya said his centre was a registered society working for the conservation and preservation of native rice varieties and that they represented the interests of farmers growing boka saul. In response to a query from the IPI office, the organisations said boka saul was a special class of quality rice famous for its value-addition properties like instant preparation of Continental delicacies and regular dishes and zero-fuel cooking requirement. The rice can be eaten after soaking it in water for 45 minutes or in lukewarm water for 15 minutes. "" Boka saul is different from other parboiled varieties of rice since there is no need of fuel for cooking. It can be made even more delicious with the addition of curd or milk, jaggery, sugar or bananas,"" Baishya said. There are two varieties of boka saul - Santi Boka and Ronga Boka. These are sown in the third to fourth week of June and harvested in November-December. Regarding the historical background, the applicants gave detailed literature dating back to Mughal era when it was recorded how Ahom soldiers subsisted on a variety of rice which was soaked in water and eaten without cooking. Other accounts included records by British officials in The Agriculture Ledger 1910 No. 1, Literature on the Races of Rices in India, Office of the Reporter on Economic Products in Government of India, Agrarian System of Medieval Assam by Jahnabi Gogoi Nath and A Statistical Account of Assam by W.W. Hunters and other literature, including poems. On the area of growth, the organisations submitted a map and details of the places after accessing data from the Assam Remote Sensing Centre. It was certified by the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Shillongani in Nagaon district. The RARS comes under Jorhat-based Assam Agricultural University. The paddy, which is sali or winter crop, is grown in Nalbari, Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon, Goalpara, Dhubri and Barpeta in lower Assam, Sivasagar in Upper Assam and Darrang and Lakhimpur in central Assam. The information was submitted to P.K.S. Bhairapannavar, examiner of trademark and geographical indications, in Chennai. The organisations said a logo had been created for boka saul and a committee would be formed to act as an internal watchdog to ensure that the quality of the product was retained. The committee members will include a senior scientist from RARS, Shillongani, programme coordinator, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Nalbari, an official of Patent Information Centre, ASTEC, regional coordinator, CEE, and project director, Lotus Progressive Centre."

But in the years since, sugarcane farmers have used political connections and legal challenges  which also buy time  to delay and thwart the MWRRAs plans for equitable water distribution. Sugarcane farmers have also pleaded financial inability to switch to drip irrigation, despite repeated orders by the MWRRA.For example, in October 2015 the MWRRA ordered the release of 10 tmc water from Punes water reservoirs to the Ujani dam in Solapur. This was challenged before the Bombay High Court, which stayed the order and also directed MWRRA member (technical) Suresh Sodal to step down, due to conflict of interest. The MWRRA, asked to review its October ruling, passed a second order that only reiterated its earlier order. But by then water levels in the reservoirs showed a 30 per cent depletion. A senior government official told The Hindu , The water was diverted to sugar cane cultivations, to benefit powerful politicians from western Maharashtra including a senior Congress party leader's farmlands. Currently, 70 per cent of Maharashtras water is used for agriculture, and over 60 per cent of that is used by sugarcane cultivators.Section 15(3) of the MWRRA Act says, The state water board, headed by a chief secretary (retired) shall prepare the draft integrated water plan [] submit the first draft to the council headed by the chief minister [] within six months from date on which the Act is made applicable in the state (2005).The senior government official told The Hindu , In the last decade, what we have actually managed to prepare is a limited water integration plan for the Godavari basin, which was received by the state government only six months back. All the west-flowing rivers  Krishna, Narmada, Tapi  are covered under this basin. Maharashtra gets an average of 164 billion cubic meters (bcm) of water annually through rains. It is allocated 126 bcm by interstate tribunals, besides 30 bcm of utilisable water from surface and groundwater sources, according to a MWRRA presentation on water pricing in the state that was released in April 2016.The presentation, made by former (his tenure ended on April 22) MWRRA member, economy, Chitkala Zutshi, explains the water use by different sectors in the state. While in 1996, 31.3 bcm (86.7 per cent of water available for use) was utilised for irrigation, 3.5 bcm (10 per cent) was used by domestic users and 1.5 bcm (four per cent) by industry. []In 2012 the same three categories accounted for 31.1 bcm (79 per cent) for irrigation, 5.7 bcm by domestic and 2.8 bcm by industry. The projected usage by 2030 is pegged at 89.7 bcm (89 per cent) for irrigation, 7.2 bcm (seven per cent) for domestic use and 3.7 bcm (four per cent) for industry.Parinita Dandekar, convenor of the South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), says that at the lower Terna reservoir, 40 km from Latur, the local sugar factory lifts 5000 lakh litres of water from this dam's dead storage.When I asked dam officials at the site about this, they said industries had reservations, and this sugar factory had a reservation of 0.5 million cubic meters of water. Compare this with the exuberance shown by political parties and administration at securing a train carrying 5 lakh litres of water. She adds that the current drought is as much due to the lack of transparency and equitable water allocation policy as it is about failing monsoon and plummeting ground water levels.Another hindrance to the organised water plan for the state is that the MWRRA itself needs to be reconstituted: the tenures of all its three jury members expired in April 2016. A senior secretariat official told this paper that the state government has finalised a proposal for the appointment of chairperson.The writer is a freelance journalist"

A price rise, however, may help mill owners to pay off cane arrears.""We have revised the sugar production estimates to 26 million tonnes from 27 million tonnes earlier,"" Abinash Verma, director-general of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), told reporters.Production in Maharashtra is likely to be about 87 lakh tonnes, lower by 3 lakh tonnes, compared with ISMA's first advance estimates of 90 lakh tonnes in September 2015.This is mainly because of lower water availability, which has affected yields in Maharashtra, he said.Because of lower rainfall in northern Karnataka, the yields are not as good and, therefore, it is estimated that sugar production will be 43 lakh tonnes in the state against 49.2 lakh tonnes in the first advance estimate, ISMA said.Sugar mills have produced 11.09 million tonnes till January 15 of the current marketing year (October-September), up 7 per cent from the year-ago period. Sugar production of India, the world's second-largest producer after Brazil, stood at 28.3 million tonnes in the 2014-15 marketing year (October-September)."

I know it,"" he said, pointing to the ""mini cup"" in his hands with the words ""India T20 World Cup Champion 2016"" inscribed on it. Ashok Chakraborty had arrived at Eden straight from Nabadwip, leaving behind Dol Utsab preparations back home. A Kohli fan, he had painted himself blue and glued pictures of the Indian players on his bare chest. He carried with him a foot-high trophy made of thermocol. ""I want to see the T20 World Cup again in (M.S.) Dhoni's hands,"" he said. Sikha Kedia came with one cheek painted in green-and-white and fast bowler Mohammad Amir's name. On the other cheek were the words ""WIN India"" in saffron, green and white. ""I love the way he (Amir) has been bowling since he came back from a ban,"" said Sikha, a doctor. ""I wish he had got a few more wickets, but I am delighted that India won."" Deja vu & dasher Twenty-nine years ago, Salim Malik had hijacked victory from certain defeat with 72 from 36 balls. On a smoggy afternoon in 2004, Salman Butt played the same role in another ODI, hitting a century that took the game away from Sourav Ganguly's India. Many inside the packed Eden Gardens had that sinking feeling again on Saturday night when Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina were out off consecutive balls. ""Match ta era throw kore dichchhe, ekmatro parley Virat banchate parey (They are throwing away the match, only Virat can save us),"" declared a middle-aged spectator in the upper tier of the clubhouse. An hour later, India had won the match and he the bragging rights. ""Did I not tell you that Virat is the new Sachin or even better in a crunch situation?"" SOS to Sania Afridi had just been caught in the deep by Kohli when Shoaib slammed a six over midwicket, followed by back-to-back boundaries in the next over to balance the equation. "" Jamaibabu ki korchhen? Sania ke dakte bol (Ask Sania to call him back)!"" quipped a teenager, referring to the Pakistan all-rounder's tennis star wife Sania Mirza. As if on cue, a ""Sania, Sania"" chant started from the gallery and reverberated through the ground.

Shanmuganathan gives a fruit packet to a patient in the civil hospital in Shillong on Thursday. Picture by UB Photos Shillong, April 7: Meghalaya governor, V. Shanmuganathan today asked the state health authorities to identify ailing mothers in the state, especially pregnant women, and provide them with adequate healthcare to help reduce infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate. The governor made this appeal after he paid a visit to the civil hospital here where he interacted with the patients, inquiring about their health and the medical treatment they received. The visit was a part of the World Health Day celebrations today. Stressing the need to take measures to arrest the rise of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, the governor suggested adoption of villages for providing proper healthcare to the people, including the mothers and pregnant women, as well as conduct a survey to identify the number of such suffering women so that maternal and infant mortality rates could be reduced drastically. The governor, after visiting Shillong civil hospital, went to Ganesh Das Hospital at Lawmali here later in the afternoon. His visit to the two main government-run hospitals in the state capital assumes importance in the wake of lack of medical facilities being provided to the people of the state, including the problem related to medicines as on many occasions. The patients admitted to government-run hospitals have to purchase medicines from pharmacies outside at their own expense because of non-availability of medicines in the hospitals. The governor visited the ultrasound section, male medical and surgical wards, female surgical ward and oncology ward in the Shillong civil hospital. At Ganesh Das Hospital, he visited the private ward, post-natal ward and paediatrics ward and interacted with the patients. He inquired about their health and the treatment received from the medical staff and wished them speedy recovery. The governor was accompanied by the minister for health and family welfare, A. L. Hek, officers of the state health department and medical staff. This year, the theme of World Health Day was, ""Beat Diabetes-Scale up prevention, strengthen care, and entrance surveillance"". To mark the occasion, various programmes were organised, including free blood sugar test at Shillong civil hospital and free diabetes and anaemia screening at Ganesh Das Hospital besides distribution of fruits packets to patients by the governor and other dignitaries."

PHOTO: M. GOVARTHANA farmer at Vellode has realised bumper yield of one tonne sugarcane in every cent on his 1.3 acre farm owing to adoption of cultivation methods under sustainable sugarcane initiative.The farmer Natarajan (67) harvested 130 tonnes and earned profit of Rs. 1.3 lakh. The farmer owes the bumper harvest to a combination of factors: application of farmyard manure, cultivation and mulching of green manure (dhaincha), timely rainfall, and spacing between saplings.Such productivity has not been recorded in any field in the entire state so far, G.R. Muthusamy, Deputy General Manager - Cane, Sakthi Sugars Unit IV, Poondurai Semur, said, adding the extent of harvest after cultivation of the crop under normal flow irrigation was unusual.The sugar unit supplied saplings of tissue cultured seedlings that were free of bacterial and viral diseases. The farmer could not only save one month by planting the saplings - the duration taken for growth of saplings after planting of sets - there was also substantial savings in terms of the cost that would have otherwise been incurred towards labour and irrigation.Each individual cane in a clump weighed about three kg. The length of an individual cane rose up to 18 feet and there were 30 nodes, Mr. Muthusamy said. Normally, 5,000 to 6,000 saplings are planted per acre with spacing of 2.5 feet. Mr. Nagarajan said he had left a spacing of four feet, and that the better sunlight and air passage resulted in heavy tillering of canes with good girth.Sugarcane farmers in Modakurichi area have been visiting the field to study the methodology for increasing productivity ever since the harvest was made earlier this month. Since ratooning has been carried out, the farmer has to bear the cost of fertilizers, irrigation and labour alone, and the returns are bound to be more in the coming years.According to Mr. Muthusamy, as many as 500 farmers with combined holdings of up to 1,500 acres are currently following SSI methodology. Under the system, the trash is shredded and converted into decomposable manure. A major advantage is that the trash will cover the field as a blanket with high water retention capacity and prevent damage to the field from Early Shoot Borer pest. Also, there will be no weed growth, Mr. Muthusamy said."

Speaking at a news conference here today, party spokesperson Ritu Baran Sarmah said on January 29, 2014, agroup of armed miscreants, allegedly from Arunachal, had fired at people protesting against encroachment on Assam territory in the Chauldhowa area under Biswanath Chariali police station. He said 15 people were killed in the incident but the Congress governments in both the states did not take any action against the perpetrators of the crime. Various organisations, including AASU, had called an economic blockade to protest against Arunachal Pradesh. ""One of those allegedly involved (in the incident) went on to become the Speaker (Nabam Rebia) of the Arunachal Assembly,"" Sarmah said. Rebia is no longer the Speaker. The BJP spokesperson alleged that the Congress government had also failed to solve the problem of erosion and improve roads. ""The government failed to even construct a full-fledged stadium. The Kanaklata civil hospital at Tezpur is functioning without a medicine specialist,"" he said. Sarmah alleged rampant corruption in the implementation of the chief minister's special schemes. He said only Congress members were being given the benefits. ""Two major industrial units of the district, ChariduarCotton Mill and the sugar mill at Karsuntola, were closed during the tenure of this Congress government. Unfortunately, the state government did not take any initiative to reopen the mills,"" said ex-AGP legislator Padma Hazarika, who joined the BJP recently . Ripun salvo: Assam PCC vice-president Ripun Bora today said the JNU episode was a result of political aggression by the BJP's student wing, ABVP. Referring to Assam BJP president Sarbananda Sonowal's recent Ashirwad Yatra, Bora said the BJP would not get the blessings of the people of Assam because they were saffronising educational institutions in the country, which also resulted in Rohith Vemula's suicide in Hyderabad Central University hostel. He said JNU's student leader Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested on false charges of sedition. ""Kanhaiya Kumar's arrest was a political conspiracy hatched by the BJP and for this reason students will never bless Sonowal,"" he said. ""The Assam PCC will protest# in every subdivision and district headquarters of the state tomorrow against curtailment of central funds to the state and will demand restoration of special category status for the state,"" he said. He also accused the BJP of failing to implement promises made before Lok Sabha polls. Bora recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured the people that he would bring back the black money within 100 days and that every Indian will get 15 lakh each in their respective bank accounts. This he said never happened. Attacking BJP leader Padma Hazarika, Borah accused him of betraying AGP, which gave him a political platform during his ""bad days"", and joining the BJP to fulfil his personal interests."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, April 4: Members of the BJP, along with local residents, today staged a demonstration in front of Lakshmisagar police station to protest against the illegal sale of liquor and brown sugar in the area. They also demanded arrest of goons involved in the trade. The agitators alleged that Haladi Padia slum had become a safe haven for criminals. ""Drug peddling has become rampant. Though we have been complaining to the local police about the illegal activities in the slum area, the cops have not initiated any action,"" alleged a protester. They also alleged that the police did not initiate any action against a local BJD councillor, who had thrashed a few local residents a couple of months ago. ""Though we had registered a complaint against the MLA, the police instead arrested the complainant,"" alleged another protester. Jagannath Pradhan of the BJP demanded action against the inspector in charge of the police station. ""The cops here seem to be enjoying the patronage of the ruling party members. The law-and-order situation is worsening day by day, but the police prefer to look the other way,"" he alleged. It is also alleged that a number of dhabas and hotels are involved in illegal sale of liquors on Cuttack Road, which comes under the same police station's jurisdiction. Deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi said night patrolling had been intensified around the slum area. ""Besides, we have also started a drive in the area to stop illegal sale of liquor. We will hold a meeting with the residents to listen to their grievances,"" said Bhoi. Haladi Padia slum came to limelight last year after its residents assaulted a few police personnel, including the Lakshmisagar police station inspector in charge and sub-inspector Ashok Hansdah, when the cops went there to rescue a youth, whom the local people had detained for having eloped with a girl of the area. The slum dwellers had kept Santosh Jena, the 25-year-old married man, who had allegedly eloped with one of his distant relatives, hostage. When the police reached the slum, the 30-strong mob, mostly women wielding sticks and bricks, attacked them. Consequently, the police personnel were forced to return from the spot. The attack was so severe that the sub-inspector had fallen in the nearby drain."
