Picture by Deepak Kumar The state government on Monday decided to return licence fees to all bars, restaurants and clubs. The fee had been collected in lieu of permission for sale of liquor at these places. Bars, restaurants and clubs had deposited the yearly licence fees at the registration and excise and prohibition departments. This was prior to introduction of complete prohibition in the state, as announced by chief minister Nitish Kumar's cabinet on April 5. With prohibition in place now, sale of the same is not possible. Briefing journalists after the cabinet meet on Monday, K.K. Pathak, principal secretary, registration and excise and prohibition department, said: ""The state cabinet today (Monday) decided to return licence fees to all such bars, restaurants and clubs offering liquor to customers."" However, the government still has not calculated the total amount that it would end up paying back to the bars, clubs and restaurants. The bar, restaurants and club owners have half-heartedly welcomed the state government's decision. Sitanshu Shekhar Singh, manager at Pind Balluchi, a restaurant in Patna, said: ""We had deposited Rs 16 lakh as annual licence fee for running our bar. It is good that the government has decided to return the fees. But the loses we will incur because of the closure of bars and restaurants is very high as compared to return of licence fees."" Sops to breweries Also on Monday, the state cabinet decided to give certain concessions to breweries in a bid to make the business attractive for existing breweries. The state cabinet decided to abolish export duty on sale of ethanol and extra-neutral alcohol (ENA) from breweries operating in the state to other states. Two types of state breweries are functioning in the state - molasses-based (ethanol) and grain-based (ENA) distilleries. Prior to prohibition, the export duty on ethanol from Bihar to other states was 50 paise per litre while in the case of ENA the export duty was Rs 4 per litre. With the abolishment of export duty on ethanol and ENA, the breweries functioning in the state need not have to pay any export duty for sale of their products outside the state. However, with this abolition, the state government will incur a loss of Rs 4 crore per annum. The decision to ban sale of liquor in the state itself would cost the exchequer Rs 4,000 crore annually, according to government estimates. Despite the feared loss, no party opposed the liquor ban in the state as they did not want to be seen to be supporting alcoholism. A senior official of UB Group said on condition of anonymity: ""We welcome the government decision to abolish export duty on sale of ethanol and ENA products from state breweries to other states. As the government has decided to give concessions on sale of these products, it should also give concessions on sale of beer having low alcohol content."" The ENA is used in manufacture of Indian-Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), while ethanol (molasses) is used in the production of country liquor. There are 12 sugar and grain-based breweries functioning in the state. Promotion rules The state cabinet also decided to bring on a par the promotion of government employees under Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) and regular employees. Earlier, there were different benchmarks and criteria for promotion of employees working under MACP and regular employees. Sources said that under MACP, government doctors and university teachers were promoted, while other government employees were covered under regular promotion rules."
58f4d03860de470aa339c06b,Exporters brace for tough time in Iran,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160127/jsp/business/story_66012.jsp,2016-01-27,"New Delhi, Jan. 26: Indian exporters are set to face a stiff competition in the Iranian market following the withdrawal of sanctions as other countries will try to sell their products at a competitive price. However, New Delhi will try to take advantage of the robust rupee trade between the two nations during the sanction era and build on that. ""The competition will intensify following the lifting of sanctions and exporters will have to competitively price their products and enhance standards to compete in the Iranian market,"" S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo), said. The withdrawal of sanction is expected to add pressure to the global crude price, which has touched a low of around $30 per barrel. Refiners can now source more crude from Tehran, which had lost its market share in the country. ""Iran will gradually ramp up production by 0.5 million barrels per day over the next six months. This will add to the overall supply glut and further softening of crude prices,"" K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president at rating agency Icra, said. India's import of crude oil from Iran has dropped to 10 million tonnes (mt) in the last fiscal from 21mt in 2008-09. The share of Iranian crude in the country's total oil imports has slumped to less than 5 per cent during this eight-year period from more than 16 per cent. Ralhan said India should focus on exporting both goods and services in sectors such as IT, iron and steel, chemicals and machinery as investments would increase in Iran. India mainly exports cereals, man-made fibres, plastics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, steel and aluminium to Iran. However, exporters of agricultural commodities such as sugar and barley maintain that they will lose the rupee trade advantage as other countries will be able to price their products competitively. ""Iran is shifting to other suppliers such as South American countries who are selling at much lower prices compared with India. We cannot compete,"" B.V. Mehta, executive director of Solvent Extractors' Association of India, said. However, All India Rice Exporters' Association expect the export of aromatic, high-quality basmati rice to Iran to rise to 1mt this year."
58f4d07960de470aa339c0d2,"Cops to guard liquor, excise faces rule-flout slur",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160322/jsp/bihar/story_75788.jsp,2016-03-22,"READY FOR BAN? In a rush to enforce partial prohibition from April 1, the registration, excise and prohibition department has allegedly flouted excise laws and appointed assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) in place of superintendents to officiate as unit in-charge of distilleries, breweries, bottling plants and sugar mills that require technical knowledge. To top it, the department has also transferred excise constables to liquor manufacturing and bottling units, while the existing laws clearly mention that only officials not below the rank of SIs can set foot on such premises. The excise department has issued several letters so far, transferring and appointing ASI and constables on important posts. They mention that this has been done on the recommendations of the current secretary of registration, excise and prohibition department, K.K. Pathak. The excise commissioner's secretary, Om Prakash Mandal, issued two letters - one on January 30, 2016 and the other on February 2, transferring over 40 ASIs working in various districts to different distilleries, breweries, sugar mills and bottling plants operating in the state. The letters, copies of which are with The Telegraph, were sent to all excise deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and superintendents, claim the transfer proposal was approved by the principal secretary of the department. They inform that all ASIs have been authorised to act as in-charge of the liquor units (except financial matters) they have been posted at. The move has created apprehensions within the department itself about how such junior officials will oversee the technical work at the units where they have been posted. The excise department also realised that the newly posted ASI at the liquor units need training to discharge their duties and issued another letter, calling them for a day's training at their Patna headquarters. A senior excise official said: ""The posting of ASIs and constables is in contravention to the Bihar Excise Act and Bihar Molasses (Control) Rules. It is clearly said in the act and the rules as to officers of which ranks should work as liquor unit in-charge or distillery officers. The provisions could be changed only by the state government, or the board of revenue through amendment to the act or the rules."" Another senior excise official pointed out that a wide range of works, including measuring the vats used in the distilling process, assessing the molasses along with their quantity and quality, monitoring ingredient input and output, monitoring the movement of spirit and produced drinks, mixing with water as well as, bottling go on at liquor units. ""These are highly technical work. The officials are also supposed to check the strength of liquor in manufacturing and bottling units. ASIs and constables are not qualified to perform these duties. They may be misled by the owners and managers of distilleries and breweries in their work,"" the official said."
58f4d1c160de470aa339c2b7,Smell of festive treat in winter air,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160103/jsp/jharkhand/story_61795.jsp,2016-01-03,"Tilkuts being sold in Ranchi on Friday ahead of Makar Sankranti. Picture by Hardeep Singh Ranchi, Jan. 2: Makar Sankranti is less than a fortnight away and the sweet delicacy that's a must during the festival has already started flooding capital markets. Cashing in on the festive demand, makeshift kiosks have sprouted almost everywhere in Ranchi, selling tilkuts, a sweet cracker rich in minerals that's consumed by people along with dahi-chura after a dip on Makar Sankranti that will be celebrated on January 14. This apart, the winter treat is also available at established grocery outlets. ""You can call tilkut a winter dessert,"" pointed out Shiv Pujan (60), who has set up a tilkut stall in Kishoreganj Chowk. ""But not many people know why tilkut is eaten only during winter. Originally, tilkuts are made of sesame seeds, which are a rich source of calcium, magnesium, iron and has lots of fibre. It is advisable to eat sesame-rich tilkuts in winter because it prevents from cold,"" explained the elderly man from Gaya, who has been coming to Ranchi with a team of five tilkut specialists every December for over three decades. But these days, many tilkut-makers reduce the portions of grinded sesame seeds to make up for the rising prices of other ingredients. ""It surely affects the taste, but people looking forward relishing to tilkuts at Rs 30 or Rs 40 per 250gm don't ask about the composition,"" Pujan said. At his stall, tilkuts are selling in the range of Rs 170 to Rs 300 a kilo. But the best tilkuts are made of finest sesame seeds mixed in right proportion either with sugar syrup or jaggery, he added. Tilkut-sellers at Upper Bazar's Mahavir Chowk are of the same opinion. A row of six to seven stalls at Mahavir Chowk do brisk business of tilkuts in December-January every year. Rest of the year, they sell other sweets and snacks. ""The price of sesame seeds has skyrocketed in the past few years. We are buying the seeds for Rs 200 per kg. The price jumps by Rs 30 to Rs 40 at least every year whereas people do not want to shell out more than Rs 120 to Rs 150 per kg. The starting price at our stall is Rs 170 a kg,"" said Rakesh Verma, one of the tilkut-sellers near Mahavir Chowk. But with variety being the name of the food game and people's taste buds always seeking something new, haven't they ever done any experiment with the delicacy? ""Yes, last year, I had experimented with aromas and taste. I made some tilkuts with kewra essence and added mewa. It tasted great and so was the price. As a result, I got no buyers. My experience says that affluent people, who can afford such experimental sweets, don't come to us. They go to big shops. Hence, no experiments this time,"" Pujan said. Any chance of the prices soaring on the day of the festival or even a day before? ""Not actually,"" Pujan said. The other tilkut walas agreed."
58f4d21260de470aa339c335,VAT strike to push up pulses' price,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160326/jsp/odisha/story_76442.jsp,2016-03-26,"File picture of a protest rally organised by traders and merchants demanding abolition of VAT on items procured from outside the state, in Bhubaneswar Bhubaneswar, March 25: The prices of pulses and other essential commodities are expected to climb with traders having threatened not to acquire them from outside the state from April 1 onwards. The traders' association said that apart from pulses, it would also stop buying wheat, wheat products and sugar in protest against the state government not waiving the value added tax (VAT) from the essential commodities. Odisha Byabasayi Mahasangha general secretary Sudhakar Panda said: ""Despite our repeated pleas, the state government is not withdrawing VAT. A faulty tax structure exists in the state. There should be a uniform tax structure."" He said traders had to pay between 10 and 12 per cent tax on the essential commodities. ""While acquiring the commodities from outside the state, we bear the transport cost that amounts to nearly 7 per cent of our total costs. In addition to that, the traders also pay 5 per cent VAT on these products. The irony is that the state government is not even getting the entire amount of the tax levied on the essential commodities. In protest, we have decided to stop buying these products from April 1."" At present, the state government is getting nearly Rs 14,500 as tax. The traders are of the view that if the state government brings in a uniform tax structure, it could earn revenue to the tune of Rs 18,000 crore. ""There will be no evasion of taxes,"" said Panda. Urging the traders to co-operate with the state government on this issue, food and civil supplies minister Sanjay Das Burma said: ""The state government is of the view that there should be a uniform VAT rate on pulses, wheat and wheat products for all states. We are meeting the traders' associations regarding this. I hope we will be able to come to a decision to end the stalemate."" The Centre is also thinking of bringing in a uniform tax structure. Sources said the state government was waiting for the Centre's move before it took a decision on this."
58f4d24860de470aa339c382,Debt suicide after 'insults',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160314/jsp/nation/story_74383.jsp,2016-03-14,"Chennai, March 13: Tamil Nadu farmers G. Balan and A. Azhagar many not have heard this adage: ""Borrow a few thousand and fail to return it, you should be worried; borrow a few million and fail to return it, the bank should be worried."" But they were hit with the full import of the saying this month after defaulting on their tractor loans. Both vehicles have been repossessed, but not before Balan was thrashed by cops and debt recovery agents. Azhagar has committed suicide, unable to bear humiliation by recovery agents. A video of Balan being beaten, recorded by a neighbour on his mobile phone and circulated on WhatsApp, has gone viral on the social media. It has invited scathing comparisons with industrialist Vijay Mallya, who caught a plane out of the country at a time he is accused of defaulting on bank loans of Rs 9,000. ""We need more Balans and fewer Mallyas,"" Vikraman, an engineering student, wrote on Facebook. Two actors, Vishal and Karunakaran, have publicly offered to repay the bank on Balan's behalf. Azhagar, 26, of Orathur village in Ariyalur, had paid Chola Finance Rs 5 lakh but failed to repay the remaining Rs 2 lakh in time, his cousin Bhagyaraj told The Telegraph. Apparently, farmers who had rented his tractor had not yet paid him. Azhagar met company officials and sought more time but half-a-dozen recovery agents barged into his home on March 10, Bhagyaraj alleged. ""They abused him and took the tractor away, ignoring his plea for a week's time,"" Bhagyaraj said. ""In the evening, we found him dead in the fields, an empty bottle of pesticide by his side."" The family has lodged a police complaint against company officials and recovery agents. The company PRO told this newspaper he couldn't comment because he didn't have ""details of the case"". Balan, 40, of Pappanadu in Thanjavur said he had defaulted on Rs 1.3 lakh out of the Rs 3.8 lakh he was to repay a private bank. ""I had sought time as I had harvested a mere 10 bags (60kg each) of paddy this year compared to the usual 32 bags. Besides, I was yet to be paid for my sugarcane crop because the local sugar factory had issued the procurement orders after a long delay,"" he said. ""But the bank dispatched recovery agents on March 4 along with four policemen. I promised to repay the loan within a month but the agents and the cops thrashed me and took the tractor away."" After watching the video, actor Vishal tweeted: ""Balan, I don't know you, but I pledge my support to you."" He has apparently asked his manager to contact the bank for the details of the loan so it can be repaid in full. ""I just need to skip partying for four weekends to save that sum but, for him, it represents his entire livelihood and honour,"" Vishal said. Fellow actor Karunakaran wrote on WhatsApp: ""Allow me to pay back the loan."" Thanjavur witnessed protests, with a group of farmers locking up a branch of the bank, which is not being named because its officials could not be contacted for comments. The police have ordered an inquiry and transferred the four cops. According to a TV channel, the bank officials yesterday tried to return the tractor but Balan refused to take it back. ""They left it with one of my relatives. I shall claim it legally after repaying the loan,"" Balan told the channel. P.R. Pandian, president of the Tamil Nadu All Farmers Association, regretted that ""even a single default on the EMI has bank officials summoning farmers"". ""We have written to all banks and finance companies to defer the EMIs because of the poor harvest but they aren't sympathetic."" A senior public sector bank official in Thanjavur said he and his peers were under pressure to collect all the dues as the financial year was coming to a close. ""We are only trying to collect the dues for loans that end during this financial year. We are not pressuring farmers who still have a few months of their loan tenure left,"" the official said. He said nationalised banks do not usually hire recovery agents."
58f4d25f60de470aa339c3a2,PMCH to start wing for malnourished kids,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160225/jsp/bihar/story_71121.jsp,2016-02-25,"The paediatric wing of the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) will start a 10-bed nutritional rehabilitation centre within the next two months for malnourished children. The centre will admit such children for 21 days and provide them with proper nutritional food and medicines. The children's mothers will also be kept at the centre and taught how to prepare low cost nutritional food and maintain proper hygiene for the children. The move would benefit many like Guddu, a two-year-old who suffers from acute malnourishment. She needs immediate attention failing which she could die, doctors have told Guddu's mother Savita Devi. ""A separate hospital team would look after the malnourished children,"" said A.K. Jaiswal, head of the paediatrics department at PMCH. ""The health department is going to recruit nine staff for the centre, including a medical officer, four nurses, a nutritional counsellor, a cook-cum-caretaker, a ward attendant-cum-cleaner and a social worker who would be entrusted to identify such children and bring them to the centre. We have earmarked the Rain Basera building in the paediatrics department campus to start a separate kitchen for the centre."" Jaiswal added: ""Items such pulses, jaggery, oats, vegetables, egg and milk would be provided to the children. Their mothers would be informed about low-cost nutritious food preparations so that once children are sent back, they could be provided with nutritious food at home as well."" The National Family Health Survey has warned about alarming malnourishment among children and women in the state. According to the survey's latest figures released two weeks ago, 61 lakh children under five years of age are severely malnourished in Bihar and 80 lakh children in the same age group are anaemic. The state's infant mortality rate stands at 48, which means 48 out of every 1,000 newborn babies die within a year of birth. The survey also revealed that out of every 1,000 children in Bihar, 58 die before they reach age five.""A severely malnourished child has chances of developing various complications, including hypoglycaemia, a condition in which the blood sugar level decreases,"" Jaiswal said. ""There are chances of brain damage in such a disorder. Besides, are also prone to infections as their immunity level decreases. The children can also develop hypothermia, a condition in which the body temperature drops."""
58f4d84860de470aa339cce3,Vijender eager to fight in Liverpool,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160108/jsp/sports/story_62812.jsp,2016-01-08,"Manchester: Star Indian boxer Vijender Singh on Thursday said it would be a dream come true to fight his fourth professional bout in Liverpool, the birthplace of his music heroes  The Beatles. Undefeated so far with three knockout wins, Vijender will fight his first bout of the year at the Liverpool Echo Arena and is looking to put up another explosive performance. The 30-year-old from Haryana says John, Paul, Ringo and George are his musical icons. When I turned professional in England, I hoped that I would one day fight in Liverpool and fight at the birthplace of my heroes, now that dream will come true on February 13, said Vijender. I love the Beatles music and I remember all the hits  Hey Jude, Yesterday, All You Need Is Love, Let It Be, Penny Lane, Here Comes The Sun, I love it all! I cant wait to get to Liverpool, Ive never fought in the city before as an amateur so now I will get my chance to get down to the Cavern Club finally. Madison Square Garden may be the home of boxing, but for me I have to get to the Cavern Club, he added. I admired boxing legends like Ali and Sugar Ray growing up, but they were never really my heroes, The Beatles, however, were the centre of my life growing up, I wanted to be a rock star! Well Im rocking opponents in the ring now! Undefeated in his professional campaign, Vijender has won all his three fights by knockout inside three rounds.Vijender aims to kick off his 2016 campaign in knockout style when he fights over six rounds in an international contest against an opponent to be announced and the 2008 Olympic Bronze Medallist is excited for the year ahead. I ended the year in great style and now Im looking to begin it in the same fashion by knocking out whoever is put in front of me. This is an important year for me to continue developing and getting in more ring experience, but Im looking to bring the excitement as well. Recently, speaking while on a holiday in India, Vijender said: ""I can't afford to take it easy. I have to be on my toes because my body cannot do without workout. So let people party, I would be in gym working out,"" he said.Vijender's first two bouts were meant to be four-round affairs, while the third one was to be a six-round contest. His next bout could be an eight-round fight but India's first Olympic and World Championships medallist prefers to keep things short and sensational. ""Isn't it thrilling? It's like blink and you miss it, it's fun to fight like that. It saves me effort, the longer the bout, more the effort.(PTI)"
58f4d94860de470aa339ce5a,"Men, eat smart for sake of child",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160103/jsp/nation/story_61866.jsp,2016-01-03,"New Delhi, Jan. 2: A man's diet could through impacts on his sperm affect his children's health, two independent medical studies on mice have suggested, implying that aspiring fathers, like would-be mothers, may need to mind what they eat. The studies, released yesterday by research groups in China, France and the US, have shown how paternal diet can affect levels of genetic material called small RNAs in sperm that can in turn influence gene expression in children. ""We've found that paternal diet can influence the expression of genes in early embryos,"" Qi Chen, a reproductive biologist at the University of Nevada in the US who is the first author of one of the studies, told The Telegraph over the phone. ""But we still don't know how exactly the changes occur,"" added Chen, who collaborated with scientists from institutions under the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and Shanghai. Chen and his colleagues fertilised mouse eggs using sperm from male mice fed a high fat diet and male mice consuming a normal diet. The offspring of fathers fed a high fat diet showed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance - a precursor to diabetes - as early as seven weeks. The condition worsened by 15 weeks. In the second study, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in the US and the University of Lyon in France found that protein-deficient diets can affect the levels of small RNA in mature sperm in mice. These changes may suppress specific genes, including one that controls the behaviour of mouse embryonic stem cells. The findings of both studies appeared in the US journal Science. The scientists say their findings corroborate what appears to be growing evidence that parental diet can affect the health of offspring. Last year, researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics in Germany had shown that loading sugar in the diet of male fruit flies one or two days before they mate can lead to obesity in their offspring through changes that influence gene expressions in the embryos. Their experiments on the Drosophila melanogaster, or fruit fly, showed how high dietary sugar increases gene expression through so-called epigenetic changes, which affect gene activity without altering the underlying DNA's sequence. The study by Anita Ost, now at Linkoping University in Sweden, and her colleagues was published in the journal Cell. Earlier studies had highlighted the importance of maternal diet for offspring. Last month, researchers at the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles showed that inadequate iron intake by pregnant women can affect brain development in infants in a subtle but significant way. Their findings, published in the journal Paediatric Research and based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the newborn, suggested that low maternal dietary iron might be associated with lower complexity of the cortical grey matter shortly after birth. ""These findings are consistent with our expectations,"" Bradley Peterson, director of the Institute of the Developing Mind, said in a media release issued by the Children's Hospital. ""Our findings add brain-based assessments to growing evidence that common inadequacies in maternal nutrition influence a child's development, even before birth."" Some surveys estimate that between 35 and 58 per cent of healthy women have a degree of iron deficiency."

Telegraph picture Patna, Jan. 14: The state government has decided to provide sugar to people below poverty line every month. It will soon provide 1.5kg of sugar to every BPL family covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. Food and consumer protection minister Madan Sahni said: ""So far, we were providing only wheat, rice to BPL beneficiaries every month. We will soon provide 1.5kg sugar also to every BPL family."" Sahni said they have identified 8.62 crore beneficiaries in the state under the NFSA guidelines and details of 8.57 crore have been uploaded in the digital database. Foodgrain allotment is being made for the updated beneficiaries while efforts are on to update details about those that have been left out. Under the NFSA, the government provides 5kg of cereals to each beneficiary at a price of Rs 2 per kg for wheat and Rs 3 for per kg of rice. Sugar is expected to be provided around Rs 18.5o for 1.5kg to the BPL families. The minister added that the rice-millers who were given paddy by the government between 2011 and 2014 for milling purpose but did not return the milled rice as mandated would face action. The number of defaulter rice-millers involved in the scam was 2024 and 7.52 lakh tonnes of rice worth Rs 1,583 crore was due with them. ""We have managed to recover over Rs 241 crore from them so far. Altogether, 331 millers have returned the full money due with them. FIRs have been lodged against 1,197 defaulter millers of whom 199 have been arrested, while 836 have surrendered. Speedy trial is being conducted against 95 accused,"" Sahni added. The department is also taking action against its 391 employees accused in the scam, which happened across the state. They are accused of siphoning off or causing a loss of 1.47 lakh tonnes of foodgrain worth Rs 111 crore. FIRs have been lodged against 162 of them and Rs 12.72 crore has been recovered from them. Sahni said proper monitoring of all functions of the department was being done and Bihar has successfully plugged leakages of foodgrain to much extent and achieved third position in the country in this regard. He added that minimum support price (MSP) in 2015-16 for paddy (average) is Rs 1,410 per quintal and for paddy (grade A) is Rs 1,460 per quintal."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160114/jsp/northeast/story_63765.jsp,2016-01-14,"Jorhat, Jan. 13: If you are among those who burn their fingers trying to turn out those wafer-thin til pithas ahead of Bihu festivities and gives up in a huff, then hang on. The Assam Agricultural University has made a device that makes this difficult-to-make savoury delicacy a child's play. Priyanka Das, a senior scientist who designed the device, said it halves the time taken and fuel consumption, besides turning out the pithas in a uniform shape with minimum breakage. ""Since making the pithas this way is so easy, it can be made by working women who are pressed for time and would also be of commercial benefit as it consumes half the time in making as well as in fuel and cost,"" Das said. ""The device is so simple in its design that it should have been made years ago."" The device comprises three round plates or two of oval-shaped ones with slightly upturned edges so that the powder does not trickle off and are joined together at the base with a plate and a thin, long handle to hold it over the fire. When placed over a gas burner it turns out two cylindrical pithas or three single-flap moon-shaped pithas at one go in two minutes flat whereas in the traditional method of pitha-making, one can be made in two to three minutes and also entails burning one's fingers if you are not an expert. People often get their fingers burnt while trying to flatten the glutinous rice powder on the hot upturned tawa or griddle as fast as possible so that it does not burn. In this case, the layer of glutinous rice powder is already placed on the plates in a thin layer and then put atop the burner. The back of a spoon is all that is required to fold it atop the coconut-sugar mixture or a sesame-jaggery mixture placed in the middle in a straight line. ""We have demonstrated its use to a self-help group here and to housewives on the campus and have received very positive reviews. A list of comments by members of the group to a questionnaire prepared by Das affirmed that the pitha made on the plates tasted just as good, were easier and faster to make, saved on fuel and there was less of burning and breaking. One response even stated that usually the glutinous rice, powdered in a dheki (husking pedal), made good pithas, but in this case, the rice powder made in a mixer produced equally tasty ones. Das said homemade pitha usually tasted better as those prepared on a commercial scale were made days ahead of the festivities and sometimes the core of coconut and sugar mix developed a rotten taste, or the amount that made up the core was so little that one hardly got any taste except for the thickened rice exterior, which was mostly hard. With this device, even a novice can make delicious pitha in a jiffy. All one needs is a stock of the glutinous rice powder stored in the refrigerator because this usually spoils fast if uncooked. Abhijit Bora, principal investigator of the All India Coordinated Research Project on Post Harvesting Engineering and Technology, under which the work was done, also made a slide presentation at Tamil Nadu Agicultural University at Coimbatore earlier this month."

58f4df3960de470aa339d627,'Hype' jab angers ayurveda healers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160326/jsp/nation/story_76517.jsp,2016-03-26,"New Delhi, March 25: A paper that has labelled alternative medicine therapies for diabetes as ""maximum hype, minimum science"" has angered ayurveda practitioners, who accuse it of ignoring abundant evidence and decades of research. The paper by Delhi-based diabetes specialists Anoop Misra and Atul Luthra and nutrition scientist Seema Gulati says there is ""scant scientific basis"" for the use of ayurvedic therapies for diabetes. It has cited systematic reviews of earlier medical studies on such therapies. Ayurveda texts and research literature have long documented black plum or jamun, fenugreek seeds (methi) and bitter gourd extracts among plant-based products as useful in controlling blood sugar. Ayurveda proponents describe such extracts as safer than modern medicines. ""The purpose of our paper is not to provoke anyone but to express our concern at a time there is much self-medication for diabetes through such alternative therapies,"" said Misra, lead author of the paper published yesterday in the journal Lancet: Diabetes-Endocrinology. ""Many people with diabetes may be trying out therapies that do not have adequate scientific justification,"" Misra, chief of the Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol in New Delhi, added. Misra and his colleagues have cited three systematic reviews conducted in 2001, 2004 and 2011 that examined multiple research studies on ayurvedic therapies for diabetes. Many such studies claim to have demonstrated that ayurvedic medicines lower blood sugar levels. But the systematic reviews have cautioned that these studies appear handicapped by small sample sizes of patients and methodological issues, implying a lack of sufficient evidence to recommend such alternative therapies as routine clinical practice. For ayurvedic medicines to be routinely prescribed to diabetes patients, Misra and his colleagues said, traditional medicine researchers would need to identify the active ingredients in the herbal products, explain their precise pharmacological actions in the body, and establish efficacy through rigorous testing. But practitioners of traditional medicine say the paper has disregarded evidence of patients benefiting from traditional remedies and evidence generated through research. They also say that ayurvedic medicine relies on combinations of various herbal products, not single active ingredients. ""Ayurvedic remedies treat the body as a whole through a mix of herbal products, not single compounds,"" said Prajapati Tripathi, principal of the Dayanand Ayurvedic Medical College at Siwan in Bihar. ""They also have lower levels of side-effects than modern medicines."" The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, an agency under the Union ministry for Ayush (ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha and homoeopathy), lists the scientific validation of medicines for diabetes, among other illnesses, as its significant achievements. ""It is incorrect to say that ayurveda cannot be used to treat diabetes. We have proven treatments ---- many patients have good sugar control through ayurvedic medicines,"" said Venu Gopinath Udayakumar, an ayurvedic physician in Malappuram, Kerala, and member of the Central Council for Indian Medicine, which too functions under the ministry for Ayush. Ayurveda involves the use of formulations containing multiple ingredients, said Gurulinganagouda Patil, principal of the Ayurvedic Medical College in Gadag, Karnataka. ""Trying to isolate a single active ingredient from a herbal product is against the principles of ayurveda,"" Patil said. The Indian Council of Medical Research, the country's apex body for promotion of biomedical research, too had in the past supported a few studies that appeared to validate claims about the efficacy of certain traditional plant-based remedies against diabetes."

At present, 90 per cent of the foodgrain production and 20 per cent of sugar output have to be packed in jute bags, with a further dilution in case of a shortfall. However, the scarcity in the availability of raw jute and supply backlog have prompted the department of food and public distribution to consider seeking cabinet permission to keep wheat out of the purview of mandatory packing under the Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987. In the current rabi season (December 2015 to April 2016), mills are looking to supply around 2 lakh bales per month against a total requirement of 13.43 lakh bales during the period. Based on the shortfall, the procuring agencies have been allowed to use 4.96 lakh bales of plastic bags. According to industry sources, the move to exclude wheat is likely to impact up to 25-30 per cent of the production of jute goods. ""Over the years, there has been several dilutions in the jute packaging materials act. Besides foodgrain and sugar, cement and fertilisers used to be covered under the act. However, they were gradually removed and the amount of sugar packed has also come down. If wheat is removed, it would be a big blow for the sector,"" an industry source said, adding that the ongoing jute year (July 2015-June 2016) has seen unprecedented shortage of the fibre resulting in a rise in prices. The steps taken by the office of the jute commissioner to control prices have already cost the industry over Rs 100 crore. The Indian Jute Mills Association has asked textile secretary Rashmi Verma not to take a hasty decision in view of the industry's performance this year. A senior textile ministry official said if the entire amount of wheat packed using jute bags was exempted at one go, it would be detrimental to the farmers as well as the mills."

Homemaker Chanda Agarwal and her septuagenarian mother-in-law Gita Devi were the only family members at home when the doorbell rang at 11.10am, nothing unusual at that time of day. Chanda opened the door to the second-floor apartment in a standalone four-storey building to find four men greeting her and introducing themselves as ""cablemen"". ""I knew at once that they weren't who they said they were, although they weren't shabbily dressed. Before I could say anything, they pushed me aside to enter our home, one of them heading straight to the bedroom where my mother-in-law was,"" she recounted. While one of the intruders pinned Gita Devi, who has a knee ailment, to the floor, his accomplices tried to overpower Chanda and muffle her cries. But she wouldn't give up. ""I kept shouting for help,"" Chanda said. Chanda's 'screamathon' alerted many of her neighbours in this locality lined with residential highrises. Shashikant Jaiswal, who lives on the third floor of the same building, was the first to respond to her cry for help. His footsteps were enough for the four to pack up. "" Chol...chol, pala, shobai ashche (run, everyone is coming),"" Gita Devi heard one of the men saying. The four, who she said conversed in Bengali and Hindi, ran with Jaiswal in pursuit, shouting "" chor...chor (thief)"". Mohit Sarkar, another neighbour of the Agarwals, was standing barely 50 metres from the building but initially couldn't make out who was chasing whom. ""Then I spotted a man holding a pair of slippers in one hand. I realised he was one of the thieves, although he was trying to behave normally. Seeing me approach him, he started running,"" he said. Sarkar chased him through Kavi Sukanta Sarani, adjoining Beleghata Main Road, before hitching a bike ride to catch the fleeing man. Another resident of the area, Gopal Sen, caught a second member of the gang. The other two, including the suspected gang leader, fled. The building off Beleghata Main Road where the robbery bid occurred.Picture by Amit Datta""The man leading the four was in a blue shirt and black trousers. When I last saw him, he was standing near the stairs leading to the main road and also shouting chor...chor. Going by his appearance, nobody could have suspected him of being a thief,"" Sarkar said. Two bags were seized from the arrested men, one containing a set of clothes and the other packed with tools and tackles that included a range, a screwdriver, a steel cutter and a knife, the police said. The duo have been identified as Suman Haldar, a resident of the Lake neighbourhood, and Raju Sheikh, from Titagarh. ""We are investigating whether the gang has more than four members,"" said joint commissioner of police (crime) Debasish Boral. The arrested men have told investigators that their gang leader, a man named Shona, had taken them to Chanda and sugar wholesaler Sajjan Agarwal's apartment by saying that they would paint the house. The robbery bid follows three incidents involving armed gangs in the city and its fringes over the past fortnight. On February 8, four armed men barged into an office in a congested Burrabazar locality and snatched Rs 2.5 lakh. The next day, a gang broke into the house of a dentist in Naktala when his elderly parents-in-law were watching television around 8pm and took away cash and valuables. The police have yet to make any arrest in either case. Early on February 7, a gang of seven had broken into a house in the Adarshpally neighbourhood of Belghoria. The robbers threatened the women of the house with a dagger if they screamed. The gang didn't spare the youngest member of the family either - a nine-year-old child who had lost her father three months ago. She had pleaded with the men to spare their home, saying her family didn't have the resources to rebuild it. When the Agarwal family's home was targeted on Friday, Chanda's husband was at work and the couple's son Keshaw, a Class II student, was at DPS Newtown."
58f4e22660de470aa339d962,Modi waves UPA schemes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160128/jsp/nation/story_66208.jsp,2016-01-28,"New Delhi, Jan. 27: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked his ministers to publicise in a ""big way"" the tweaked versions of the UPA's signature social programmes, MNREGA and Aadhaar, which he ridiculed in the past. The Centre is to shortly launch a pilot project for making payments under the rural jobs scheme MNREGA to the bank accounts of targeted beneficiaries through Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT). Aadhaar data will be used for the transfer to speed up payments, remove leakages and augment financial inclusion. Modi said a sum of Rs 335 crore has been allocated to Kerala where the DBT scheme will first be tried out. During the campaign for the 2014 elections, Modi had described Aadhaar as a ""scam"". Last February, he said MNREGA was ""proof"" of the UPA's ""failings"". The Prime Minister had called a meeting of his entire council of ministers. The agriculture and agri-related ministries were asked to make presentations on programmes they had to implement based on cabinet decisions, update the council on the status of each programme and give a timeline for their completion, with details of how deadlines would be met. The cabinet secretary opened the discussions with an overall presentation on the ministries concerned. ""The idea was to familiarise those from the other ministries with the nitty-gritty of the agri-related departments and draw a big picture so that we get talking points to take back to our constituencies,"" a minister said. Modi also asked the ministers to publicise the easy availability of fertilisers and urea. ""In the past, the Centre used to be flooded with entreaties from the states complaining of fertiliser shortages. Lathicharges on farmers laying siege on fertiliser godowns used to be frequent. That has stopped,"" a minister quoted Modi as saying. The Prime Minister also asked his colleagues to speak at length on payments made to sugar mills to enable them to clear arrears due to sugarcane cultivators. Such sector-specific meetings will be held each month. A meeting of the social welfare ministries has been scheduled in February. Government sources said an objective of the monthly meetings was to give the Prime Minister a chance to assess the performance of each minister and get a sense before shuffling his team. ""If we interact one-on-one with the Prime Minister and discuss our ministry, we have no idea of how our colleagues are performing. Such a large gathering enables us also to make a judgement, compare our performance with our colleagues and look for ways of enhancing it. This sort of meeting kindles competitiveness among us,"" a junior minister said."

Picture by Dipankar Roy  The hall is well-lit, thanks to the shafts of sunlight that come through the large openings where there were once windows and some scattered apertures in the tin roof and the walls. The hall once hosted a plant to process the famous pineapples of Hmarkhawlein, about 40km from Silchar, in Cachar district.  At Anipur in Karimganj district, a once-flourishing sugar mill lies closed. The farmers at Cheragi no longer cultivate the sugarcane that fed the plant. They have gone back to growing paddy.  The Modern Food Industry had set up a juice concentrate plant at Ramnagar with an investment of Rs 1 crore. Even before the first drop of juice could come out of the plant, the project was aborted. It now has turned into a transport company's garage for its buses.  The placards at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election rally at Panchgram in Hailakandi district read: ""Welcome Hon'ble Prime Minister. Save Cachar Paper Mill. Save Barak Valley."" We in Barak Valley are paying the price of tolerance,"" fumed Sanjit Debnath. ""This area has remained neglected and the powers that be at Dispur have been exceptionally indifferent to its development needs,"" he said. ""We have been tolerant and the various agitations now and then have been democratic and peaceful."" Debnath is president of the newly floated Barakbhumi Ganatantrik Dal whose avowed aim is to separate Barak Valley from Assam. The party has not fielded candidates in the elections this time but is extending support to some like-minded candidates. Women hold up placards welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asking for the reopeningof Cachar Paper Mill during an election rally at Panchgram. Picture by UB Photos ""Like the British then, the Assam government has also kept Barak Valley as its colony. The British once ruled Assam and Cachar from Dhaka, now the Assam government rules Barak Valley from the Brahmaputra Valley and the exploitation has continued,"" he said. ""The only way out is for Barak to be on its own, out of the clutches of the Brahmaputra Valley,"" he said. Barak Valley had comprised only Cachar till it was cut up to create two more districts of Hailakandi and Karimganj. The separation cry is not new, though. It was first raised by the Union Territory Demand Committee. The Barakbhumi Ganatantrik Dal is backed by the UTDC, which was formed in the seventies. ""Politicians who represent Barak Valley do not have the spine to raise our demand before their leadership as they are obliged to them for being given tickets to contest in the elections,"" Debnath said. ""It is time we stopped begging from the Brahmaputra Valley."" However, all are not ready to buy the separate Barak Valley demand. The opposition, though, stems from arguments that have religious undertones. ""A section of the Hindus wishes to remain with Assam because they feel that if Barak were to become a separate entity then Muslims would start controlling them. On the other hand, Muslims fear just the opposite,"" said Samiran Choudhury, who was once associated with another separate-Barak movement in the nineties. ""At the same time, there is also a feeling that leaders of the respective communities put forth such arguments only for their own vested interest which are served better if Barak remains with Assam,"" he said. Jyotilal Chowdhury, author and veteran journalist, said, ""There is no industry in this area despite potential for several. This is a classic case of stepmotherly treatment."" According to him, all the industrial units that had closed down over the years were financially viable and yet those were allowed to die. ""Barak Valley can hope to get justice only if all its public representatives irrespective of their party affiliations get together and raise their voice,"" Chowdhury said. Barak Valley sends 15 MLAs to the 126-seat Assembly At Hmarkhawlien, L. Thanmawia Pajamt, vice-president of Hmar Supreme House, said the pineapples of the area were perhaps the best in the world with a very high sugar content and its cultivation was the main source of income for the people. ""Unfortunately, there has been no government intervention to promote marketing of the fruit. The growers are left to fend for themselves, which in turn helps middlemen. A fruit processing unit could change the economic scenario of this place,"" he said. About a crore of pineapples are grown every year. Reverend Lalliensung, pastor of the Presbyterian Church of India, lamented that politicians only came to Hmarkhawlien before the elections, made their promises and went back. ""Few spare a thought for us,"" he said. Perhaps unknown to many, National Highway 37 now lies in a straight line connecting Karimganj district - right from the border with Bangladesh at Sutarkandi - to Imphal, replacing NH 53. In its earlier alignment from Goalpara to Tinsukia in the Brahmaputra Valley, the highway had passed through some of the more prosperous areas of Assam. Barak Valley would hope and pray that NH 37 brings it luck as well."

This has also been my personal experience where the app overestimated my activity level by as much as 10,000 steps in a given day, where a bumpy jeep ride was mistaken for a marathon, he says.Another setback is that popular apps are still in a nascent stage of development. Most are geared towards American and European lifestyles. According to Sheela Krishnaswamy, a Bengaluru-based diet, nutrition and wellness consultant, users may find it difficult to measure portion sizes or input accurate measures. Inaccurate data entry by the user will lead to inaccurate information output by the app. Many of the apps give information only about calories. However, calories are only a part of the entire nutrition picture. An app cannot [be a] substitute [for] a nutritionist, she says.Some doctors do have a bank of tried and tested apps that they recommend to patients. We make our patients aware of the various options available, but the final choice is left to them, says Dr. Naresh Bhat, chief of liver and gastroenterology at Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru. There are some apps for medical professionals, too, and my younger colleagues who use them find them beneficial.Gynaecologist Dr. Hema Divakar often asks her patients who have issues with high blood pressure or sugar during pregnancy, to send the readings through an app. Patients find it very reassuring that they have a virtual connect with me and will receive alert messages when such [a] situation arises. This avoids anxiety and minimises visits to the hospital. Considering the traffic jams and logistics, this is a real relief, says Dr. Divakar, who represents the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) at the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO).Get up, work outDr. Rebecca Kuriyan-Raj, associate professor who also heads the Nutrition and Lifestyle Clinic at St Johns Medical College Hospital, Bengaluru, adds that fitness gadgets actually help people realise how sedentary their lifestyles are. This could further motivate them to increase their physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour. Any of these devices and apps needs to be validated against a criterion method. So, while buying or asking for a fitness gadget, it is always good to ask for accuracy, she says.Dr. Anil Kapur, Chairman of the World Diabetes Foundation, also feels that apps and gadgets serve as motivational tools and can help those who want to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. They also serve to improve understanding of the consequence of actions related to eating and exercise and, therefore, are good tools for behaviour change, he says.Theres no going back to a world without apps. Experts recommend that users opt for apps with clear privacy rules, and only after discussing it with their doctors.

A resident of Khusrupur (around 35km east of Patna), Ghanshyam is now admitted to the de-addiction centre of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital to cope with the partial prohibition that has been implemented across the state. He is a data entry operator in a government office in Hajipur. The case of 27-year-old Kundan Kumar Singh is also similar.A teacher at a private school in Barh, Kundan too, wants to get rid of his addiction and has taken admission at the same centre. Ghanshyam and Kundan are two of the eight patients who turned up for consultation at the de-addiction centre since yesterday. The experts associated with the centre said both Ghanshyam and Kundan required constant monitoring, as they were heavy drinkers. Ghanshyam said: ""I used to consume at least eight bottles of country liquor daily. I decided to quit alcohol and have come to this centre for help."" The family of both the addicts hailed the state government's initiative to ban country liquor. Kundan's uncle S.K. Singh said: ""The addiction not only destroys the life of the addicts but their families suffer as well. It is good that the government is now taking steps to ban alcohol consumption and has come up with a de-addiction centre."" Ghazala Imam, one of the psychiatrists with the NMCH's de-addiction centre, said yoga and other sessions would be launched in the de-addiction centre soon. ""At present, we are giving dextrose injections to patients to maintain their sugar levels. The sugar level falls down when alcohol is consumed heavily and can lead to several problems. We are also giving Vitamin supplements to the patients and other medicines to treat nerve problems, if any. In any kind of addiction, the nerves of a person gets weak and needs to be treated accordingly,"" said Imam."

Picture by Prashant Mitra A reputable general surgeon of Jharkhand was found dead on Ranchi's railway tracks - his head severed from his body - on Thursday morning, with police strongly suspecting suicide and ruling out foul play. Dr Mohan Prasad (50), a resident of Ashok Nagar in the capital, practised mostly in Daltonganj. He was once a government doctor who took voluntary retirement 10 years ago and established Awadh Sahodri Clinic, a nursing home in the Palamau district headquarters, sources said. Dr Mohan had high blood sugar and was said to be depressed of late though no one could say why. Wife Dr Asha Prasad is an eye specialist who worked at RIMS, Ranchi, two years ago before relocating with him to Daltonganj. The doctor couple's son Karan Mohan is an MBBS student at RIMS. Ranchi station manager H.K. Sharma said the body was spotted on railway tracks soon after the Tata-Jharsuguda Passenger left platform 3 for Hatia at 11.04am. He informed the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP). A GRP officer said the body was found close to the footbridge area of platform 3. ""While the severed head lay within the tracks, the rest of him was outside. The man was wearing chequered shirt, black trousers and slippers. He wore spectacles too. His pocket yielded Rs 35 and a platform ticket issued at 11am,"" the railway policeman said. RPF sub-inspector Ram Avtar Meena said prima facie it appeared to be a case of suicide. ""Before the train arrived at 10.54am, the tracks were said to be clear. After the train departed at 11.04am, the body was spotted. Also, there was no passenger ticket on the person. These are strong indications of a suicide,"" Meena said. According to the RPF officer, Dr Prasad possibly laid his neck on the rail from the off side just before the train chugged out of platform 3. The body has been sent to RIMS for post-mortem, Meena added. Officer-in-charge of Ranchi GRP post Ram Narayan Thakur ruled out foul play. ""It is either a case of accident or suicide. CCTV camera footage are being checked to understand how the doctor got down on the tracks unnoticed. So far, all we know is that he purchased a platform ticket from window 12, crossed the footbridge and reached platform 3,"" Thakur said, adding that Dr Asha, who is currently in Ranchi, identified the body at RIMS. A friend of son Karan said Dr Mohan was a sugar patient and depressed of late. ""But, we never thought he would be prone to suicide. During the RIMS ragging ruckus two years ago, uncle and aunty counselled and supported us. It is hard to believe uncle is no more,"" the MBBS student said. Dr Arun Kumar Sinha, another reputable doctor practising in Daltonganj and a member of Indian Medical Association, expressed his shock. ""Dr Mohan was a wonderful man - extremely jovial and caring.

Maharashtra is now suffering its third drought in the last four years, with monsoons having failed in both 2014 and 2015, and with the 2016 summer beginning arid and burning hot. With this tragedy as context, the Bombay High Court has ruled that all Indian Premier League matches scheduled in Maharashtra after April 30 -- 13 of them - should be accommodated elsewhere because pitches need water. One estimate suggests that the originally scheduled 20 matches would have used six million litres of water. The court has said that this would not be a solution, but the move could be the beginning of palliation. There is a symbolic force in the court's decision, a call to arms against the drought. For apart from the great financial loss this move would cause, there is also the damage to the IPL's brand value, for its reach is international. Besides, cricket is part of Maharashtra's soil: Sachin Tendulkar is a dazzling star in a firmament that is crowded with heroes, whether they be Sunil Gavaskar or Vijay Merchant or Polly Umrigar. Symbolic gestures, however, are not solutions. The problem in Maharashtra is longstanding, and this does not refer to the drought alone. One of the state's major cash crops is sugarcane, for the growth of which Maharashtra's conditions were always unsuitable. Apart from anything else, growing the crop and crushing it after harvest for the sugar industry demand enormous amounts of water, which has never been overflowing in the state. As it is, 80 per cent of it is grown in areas where water is scarce anyway. To compare it to the IPL wastage, one estimate says that more than 1,500 litres of water are used to produce one kilogram of sugar, that is, from growth of the plant to sugar production. So if 2.5 million people, or 20 per cent of Mumbai's population, have one teaspoon of sugar in their tea a day, that is nearly 10,000 kg of sugar, that has cost 15 million litres of water. Rather more than the IPL pitches. Since this situation has taken years to develop, it is amazing that no policy regarding water use and governance has evolved. Neither has there been any effort to engage, on a broader scale, experts, researchers and water specialists to work out how water can be sourced and preserved to sustain life and livelihoods for the long term in a water-scarce state. Ambition without vision is dangerous."

In another 15 years, the figure is expected to rise to 101 million. In all this, more than 90 per cent of cases are lifestyle-induced.Individuals with diabetes do not have any symptoms for long periods of time and may have complications at the time of diagnosis. Common examples such as retinopathy (blindness), nephropathy (kidney disease), neuropathy (nerve damage) and diabetic foot (gangrene and amputations in extreme cases) affect a large proportion of individuals with diabetes. Approximately a third of those with diabetes are known to develop retinopathy. Diabetes is also known to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (heart attack and stroke); nearly half of those with diabetes die of heart attack.A bad lifestyle is what propels this epidemic while an inadequate response from the health system results in debilitating complications. The staggering increase of cases of diabetics and prediabetics has been attributed to lifestyle changes as a result of rapid and unplanned urbanisation, an ageing population, a sedentary lifestyle and increasing consumption of unhealthy food, especially modern processed foods. Lack of opportunistic screening delays diagnosis while poor access to care and medicines, information asymmetry between doctors and patients, and a paucity of well-trained human resource, impede evidence-based management of diabetes.Health promotion strategiesPrevention remains central in halting the current pace of the diabetes epidemic. Our focus should be on both individual and policy-level interventions. Health promotion strategies should be aimed at maintaining normal body weight by improving physical activity and following a balanced and healthy diet. Evidence from the [international] Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) shows that small reductions in weight by moderate-intensity activity of at least 150 minutes per week and reduced fat consumption on most days prevented progression to diabetes by 58 per cent among those with prediabetes.In general, brisk walking for at least 30 minutes a day and following a healthy diet every day which has at least 3-5 servings of locally available and inexpensive fruits and vegetables, and less refined sugar and saturated fat can prevent or postpone the occurrence of diabetes. Doing yoga may also help prevent diabetes; in individuals with diabetes, it may even help them have better control of blood sugar. In addition, every adult above 30 years should be screened for diabetes and hypertension during a planned or unplanned visit to a physician or hospital.Policy measures also call for reinforcement of health systems. Higher taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages and high fat junk foods and planning urban infrastructure to promote physical activity have become all the more imperative now.Diabetes is no longer a disease predominantly affecting the rich and is fast spreading to rural communities. The poor are even more vulnerable. Thus India has: a population where the number of people with diabetes has increased substantially over time and is set to continuously grow; a large number of people disabled by complications, and an equivalent number who are unaware of the condition.Early diagnosis and prevention is the key to control the disease and minimise the risk of disability. In this, we need a multi-pronged approach that involves collaboration among national leaders, clinicians, public health researchers and allied health professionals.Dr. D. Prabhakaran is an epidemiologist by training and the Vice-President, Research and Policy at the Public Health Foundation of India.In prevention strategy, the focus should be on both individual and policy level interventions"

The shock was difficult for his wife to gulp down, who doctors had to explain the effects of withdrawal symptoms to calm down. She had to be explained that disorientation of places and persons was a withdrawal symptom that an alcohol addict may suffer after quitting alcohol. According to doctors, a person suffers from withdrawal symptoms after giving up on alcohol consumption suddenly. Though there are drugs to treat the condition but a strong willpower and support from the family members is required to fight the situation. The head of the psychiatry department of Patna Medical College and Hospital, Pramod Kumar, said: ""Withdrawal symptoms are mainly seen among people who are alcohol addicts and suddenly stop drinking. They develop neuroadaptation, which means their body is used to the substance (alcohol). When s/he quits the habit, they feel uncomfortable and develop withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia, burning sensations and sweating among others. ""Consulting a doctor or a de-addiction centre is advised if one develops any such problems,"" Pramnod said. ""Often, people suffer from hypertension after getting rid of an addiction. Yoga, spiritual lessons and music help them calm down and increase their willpower to continue with their decisions"" Talking about the ways to manage withdrawal symptoms, Prashant Kumar, the nodal officer at NMCH's de-addiction centre, said: ""We prescribe Benzodiazepine to treat patients with withdrawal symptoms. We reduce the dosage of the drug as the treatment goes on. Besides, we give dextrose injections to patients to fight the sugar deficiency in the their body.

On December 21, former BSBCL managing director Ashwini Dattatraya wrote a letter to PMC municipal commissioner Jai Singh, requesting him to arrange for 90 shops for it to set up retail liquor outlets. However, Jai Singh, in a letter to the principal urban development and housing secretary on Thursday, claimed that the empowered standing committee of PMC had not approved the transfer of its vacant commercial property to BSBCL. Singh sought guidelines from the department for further action on this issue. Eventually, mayor Afzal Imam, who heads the standing committee, had reservations over the locations, where the shops had been demanded. ""The commissioner is seeking our approval on the handover of our commercial properties at a few select locations. However, we want the shops to be evenly distributed across the city,"" said Imam.

City doctors claimed that cases of heat stroke, which were negligible till around two weeks ago, had started pouring in. While four heat stroke-related patients had been admitted at Patna Medical College and Hospital till Monday, the corresponding figure at the emergency wing of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) was three. Officials at both Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) said they were keeping heat stroke-related patients in the emergency wing.

As their body temperature keeps increasing and fluid loss occurs, they run the risk of developing cardiovascular problems and multi-organ failure, which may turn fatal. This is why we keep these patients in the emergency wing only,"" said Sudhir Kumar, in-charge at the medicine department of IGIMS. The physician said all three heat stroke patients admitted to the hospital were elderly. ""Two of three patients have a history of diabetes. Diabetics are more susceptible to heat stroke because they have increased risk of dehydration. High blood sugar leads to decreased hydration in body and a person suffering from dehydration can catch heat stroke easily. The elderly should shield themselves from this condition, especially if they are diabetic."" Talking about the various symptoms of heat stroke, V.P. Sinha, a physician at PMCH, said: ""High body temperature, increased heartbeat, cramps in muscle, nausea, lack of sweating are few of its symptoms. Heat stroke occurs when the portion of the brain that regulates body temperature fails to work properly owing to excessive heat. The body temperature keeps increasing and fluid loss occurs, leading to cardiovascular collapse and multi-organ failure and it may result in death. One should try to drink as much as water one can. Don't go outside on an empty stomach and take Electral powder solution from time to time.""

In 2014 and 2015, 120 children were detected with AES in Malda district and 42 of them died. A team from the NIV visited Malda in 2014 and 2015 and collected blood samples of the children. ""They did not find the presence of any known virus which would have led to the death of the children. They have, however, reconfirmed our findings that because of the consumption of litchi, the blood sugar levels of these children had come down considerably,"" Mondal said. ""Most of these children were from five blocks in the district with litchi plantations. Litchi is usually harvested during the summer and there were reports that children who fell to AES and lost their lives had litchi,"" he said. The five blocks where litchi is cultivated are Kaliachak-I, II and III, Manikchak and Englishbazar. After the children's deaths from AES, the state health department carried out a thorough investigation and the sugar level drop was revealed. ""We will launch an awareness campaign. A two-page leaflet will be distributed among people mentioning that children should not be allowed to have litchi in empty stomach. In case any child falls ill or becomes unconscious, he/she should be provided with glucose immediately to balance their sugar level,"" the CMOH said. ""Further, parents would be advised to take their children to the nearest health centre,"" he added. ""We had adopted this style of treatment in 2015 and could reduce the number of child deaths. This year, seven children have been diagnosed with AES so far but there has been no deaths,"" the district health official said."

Picture by Prashanat Mitra Ranchi, Aug. 14: Chief minister Raghubar Das today launched a biometric system to check pilferage of subsidised grains and said his government was contemplating ways to turn PDS shops into normal grocery stores to ensure food security for all. ""We want that PDS outlets double up as normal grocery shops. The government is in talks with companies, namely Future Group, which may assist the state in this endeavour in near future,"" Das said after unveiling the electronic point of sale (e-PoS) machines at the new auditorium of Project Building in Ranchi. According to officials, the e-PoS machines, rolled out in eight districts including Ranchi and Khunti today, are like computerised PDS shops. A beneficiary needs to provide his fingerprints in the machine, which will authenticate the genuineness of the card holder before the shop owner gives food grains. The device will automatically generate a receipt which will bear the details like the name, ration card number, quantities of the items like rice, wheat, iodised salt, sugar and kerosene oil distributed. The government aims to implement the same in all the 24 districts, covering over 23,000 PDS shops, by October. State food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Saryu Roy said PDS dealers might face some problems in using the devices, which would be connected online to a centralised system, in the initial stage. But it does not mean that they would shy away from implementing the project. ""The old systems are bygone. The department will take stern action against officials and other stakeholders if the new system is not implemented strictly. We are also set to launch a new system, wherein food grains originating from godowns of Food Corporation of India (FCI) will be tracked till it reaches PDS shops and finally beneficiaries even in far-flung areas,"" Roy said. Out of the total 3.29 crore people in the state, over 2.63 crore have already been brought under the ambit of NFSA and issued ration cards. The minister announced that those who had not been issued ration cards under NFSA would get white ration cards that would allow them to avail subsidised kerosene oil. He also appealed people, who did not qualify for the NFSA benefits but were either knowingly or unknowingly issued ration cards, to surrender the same so that real beneficiaries could avail the subsidised grains. ""There have been many complaints from districts that poor beneficiaries, including particularly vulnerable tribal groups, have not been issued ration cards while affluent ones are enjoying the benefits. This shall end, otherwise government may take legal action,"" Roy warned. Chief secretary Rajbala Verma said rural folks required 2,400 calories per day while their urban counterparts needed only around 2,100 calories. ""But unfortunately, many people, majority of them belonging to the Scheduled Tribe and Schedule Castes, do not get the required amount of food to fulfil their calorie requirements. Through a better PDS system, we can end this problem,"" she added. Present during the programme were chief minister's secretary Sunil Kumar Barnwal, secretary (food and civil supplies) Vinay Kumar Choubey, food rights activist Balram and PDS shop owners, among others."

The community has questioned the government's wisdom in coming up with a bill with provision for action against those selling medicines with alcoholic content. It has also raised objections to making possession of spirits illegal. The bill that was tabled in the Assembly on Monday states a chemist or medicine dealer storing medicines with alcohol properties on his/her premises can be imprisoned for eight years to 10 years, and face a penalty of Rs 1 lakh up to Rs 10 lakh. Similarly, if anyone keeps spirit - as drink or for medicinal purpose - s/he may land a minimum 10 years' imprisonment. The person would have to pay a penalty of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. Neurosurgeon A.K. Agrawal termed such provisions unwise. ""The government has taken a non-scientific approach in implementing prohibition,"" he said. ""If alcohol is used in medicines, it is being used as one of the chemicals. Alcohol is not being used as a sedative in drugs. The government's decision to ban the sale of medicines with alcohol content does not make any sense at all."" He was even more vocal about the government's ban on spirits. ""Doctors cannot imagine performing operations without spirit. Spirit is rubbed on the body parts prior to operation. Not only this, spirit swab is used prior to injections to reduce chances of infection,"" Dr Agrawal said. ""How will use spirit before administering injections to a patient if this new bill is passed. And, if we stop using spirits during such procedures, patients will be at the risk of developing infections. I would suggest the politicians who have added such foolish provisions in the new prohibition bill to perform operations in the districts and blocks first."" ""Medical college and hospitals can minimise use of spirits because they have costly agents but doctors in the district and block hospitals have no other option but to use spirits during operations and other procedures. If this new bill comes into effect, the medical community will keep on landing in jails,"" Agrawal added. Ranjit Kumar, the Bihar Health Services Association general secretary, said the government should have kept medicines out of the new excise bill's purview, as it will directly affect treatment. President of Indian Medical Association-Bihar Sachchidanand Kumar was rather sceptical about the government's ability to ban the use of spirits and medicines with alcohol content in state-run hospitals. ""Cough syrups have alcohol content. Even the state-run hospitals provide such medicines to patients. Will the government stop providing cough syrups to patients from now? At primary health centres, doctors use spirit lamps to access a patient's blood sugar levels. If they stop using this, how will they find the blood sugar level of the patient?"" said Sachchidanand. ""The government should have consulted medical experts before bringing in such provisions."" Parsan Kumar Singh, the president of Bihar Chemists and Druggists Association, said the organisation will urge the government to change the bill's provisions regarding to medicines and spirits. ""There are many patients for whom the anti-depressant medicines work wonders. There are people who misuse such drugs but the government should not ban such drugs on the ground of possible misuse,"" he said. ""There are people who are getting benefits from these drugs. As far as spirits are concerned, every chemist keeps them because they are used before giving injections. Now that the government has banned spirits, we would ask the patients get an injection at the secretariat."""

Addressing a news conference here, the veteran Nationalist Congress Party leader said: ""The allocation of Rs 35,984 crore for the agriculture is a camouflage. Out of this, Rs 15,000 crore is for interest subvention. ""This amount used to be shown under the banking department previously. The actual allocation for agriculture sector is Rs 20,984 crore. This has been now shifted from banking to agriculture. That's camouflaging."" Pawar explained: ""Budgetary allocation for interest subvention was started during the UPA time but that was not under the agriculture head. An impression is being created that the government has come up with the biggest vision for agriculture. This is a false impression. ""The only good thing is support shown to MGNREGA against the backdrop of the Prime Minister and others ridiculing this welfare scheme. They were questioning the viability of this programme."" Pawar added: ""Because of the substantial rise in the minimum support price (MSP) during the UPA regime, India became the largest exporter of rice in the world and the second largest exporter of wheat, sugar and cotton. This government has taken no concrete decision on MSP. Production is going down for two years and it is worrisome."" He also questioned the government's claim about doubling of agriculture income in a particular time frame, saying: ""This is a hollow statement. For agriculture income to double, we need a 14 per cent rise every year. Figures don't match."" He also asked the Centre not to claim credit for crop insurance started by the UPA. Speaking on the JNU row and communalism, Pawar accused the Narendra Modi government of providing ""direct and indirect"" support to divisive forces. ""What happened in Hyderabad University and JNU are not good for the country,"" Pawar said. ""Communal temperatures are deliberately being pushed up. Society is being polarised to create fear psychosis among the minorities. Some forces got emboldened under this regime."" Asked about the Prime Minister's silence, he said, ""The Prime Minister does not speak on any such issue.... His Mann ki baat has no place for such concerns."""

Telegraph Picture Tamluk, Aug. 14: The families of two pregnant women yesterday confined a sub-divisional hospital superintendent in Haldia after she referred the patients to a Tamluk hospital, 50km away, because there was no anaesthetist to aid in Caesarean section procedures. Superintendent Sumona Dasgupta was compelled to call in an anaesthetist who was unwell. Anaesthetist Sukhendu Kar helped conduct the two surgeries but refused to work after that saying he may endanger the life of patients if he worked despite his high blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Dasgupta said: ""There are three anaesthetists' posts in the hospital, of which one has been vacant for the last three years. One doctor had a motorcycle accident and is on leave. The other has fallen ill. As a result, all operations stopped."" The Haldia subdivisional hospital, which has 230 beds, has not conducted any surgery in the last 11 days. The families of the two women requiring urgent Caesarean sections did not know this and had gone to the hospital yesterday evening. When Dasgupta referred them to the Tamluk hospital, the families surrounded her and demanded that an immediate arrangement be made there itself. Dasgupta then called for Kar from his quarters, who assisted in the operation but later said he was feeling ill and threatened to quit if he was forced to attend more surgeries. Dasgupta said: ""Yesterday, in a bid to control the situation, I had to request the sick doctor to come over.... The chief medical officer of health has been told about the situation."" Kar, the lone anaesthetist, had been on day and night duty. The doctor fell ill 11 days ago. ""I have high blood sugar and pressure.

Spectrum use charge is an annual levy and calculated as a percentage of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of telecom companies. The cabinet has proposed a weighted average formula for spectrum that are already with operators. ""The weighted average of SUC rates across all spectrum assigned to an operator (whether assigned administratively or through auction or trading) in all access spectrum bands, including BWA spectrum obtained in 2010 auction shall be applied for charging SUC subject to a minimum of 3 per cent of AGR."" The weighted average will be derived by the sum of the product of spectrum holdings and applicable SUC rate divided by the total holding. The rate shall be determined for each service area. The decision on existing spectrum means the use charge for broadband spectrum (2100MHz) will be raised to 3 per cent from 1 per cent , hurting Reliance Jio. BWA (broadband wireless access) spectrum bought in 2010 was kept out of the ambit of the weighted average use charge and attracted a levy of only 1 per cent. The cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has also fixed use charge paid by operators in 2015-16 as the floor amount. Operators will not pay less than the amount they have paid in the last fiscal even if the new formula lowers the liability on them. However, if the revenue of an operator declines, the floor amount of the SUC shall be reduced proportionately. ""This will facilitate to move to a simple, transparent and flat ad valorem SUC regime in accordance with the law and avoid creative accounting to bypass the revenues,"" a government said. Following today's decision, the department of telecom can issue the notice inviting application (NIA) for the auction to be held in September in which spectrum worth Rs 5.5 lakh crore will be put up for sale. Sugar subsidy The cabinet committee on economic affairs has approved a new formula to calculate production subsidy to mills for the ongoing 2015-16 season after taking into account lower output and exports. To address liquidity stress in the industry and facilitate timely payment of cane arrears, the Centre last year had announced a subsidy of Rs 4.50 per quintal of cane crushed during 2015-16 season provided the mills met the export quota of 4 million tonnes and ethanol blending target."

The objective of the drive is to create awareness among women on how they can prevent the disease and underscore the need for its early medical intervention.""Diabetes is a condition, which left untreated, can lead to several complications. It can affect a person in any age group. More elderly women die of Type 2 diabetes as compared to their male counterparts. Although on an average, the longevity of people has increased to 80 years, many women below 60 years die of Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is also common among young women and many die of it because they either remain unaware of their disease or do not take timely medical intervention,"" said Dipti Sarma, head of the department of endocrinology of GMCH. ""We have conducted a training of physicians on how they can treat women with diabetes and at the same time create awareness about the need to follow a proper lifestyle and diet to keep the disease at bay,"" said Sarma. Experts said people are also not aware of gestational diabetes that affects the health of pregnant women. This form of diabetes, if left untreated, can deter the development of the foetus. ""During pregnancy, a woman's body is under a lot of stress and the glucose level in her body can fluctuate. When the blood sugar level goes up, it can affect the foetus's development. This form of diabetes can occur early in pregnancy or later,"" said Sonali Barman Bhuyan, a senior doctor who has been studying the disease for more than a decade. ""Women, who have a family history of diabetes, are more prone to suffer from the disease during pregnancy. So it is advisable that all pregnant women should undergo the glucose tolerant test during pregnancy to ensure that their blood sugar levels are normal. While the blood sugar levels go down post delivery, women with gestational diabetes have the chance of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life,"" said Bhuyan."

Picture by Bhola Prasad What are the smart ways to handle summer? Take short breaks during travel. Wear light and loose clothes. Apply sunscreen. And, never ever leave children or senior citizens in parked vehicles. Safe Club members of ADLS Sunshine School in Sakchi, Jamshedpur, picked up these tips and more on Wednesday from Dr Narain Pandey of Tata Main Hospital during Sunsense, a daylong campus programme to promote healthy summer habits among children and to break myths. The students interviewed the doctor and noted down advices, which will be passed on to their juniors. ""The worst thing that people do nowadays is leave their little children in stuffy, parked cars unaware of the fact that the temperature inside is three times more (if the AC isn't on) and can cause heat stroke in five minutes,"" Dr Pandey told his ardent listeners. The specialist in medicine advised use of glares and umbrellas while advocating against prickly heat powder and glucose drinks. ""The powder blocks pores and prevents sweating, which is actually unhealthy as against popular belief. On the other hand, glucose drinks as well as aerated ones can make you more thirsty."" The campus programme thus displayed fruits like watermelons and healthy drinks such as aam panna, lassi and buttermilk. Sunsense also busted the myth of eating heavy meals before leaving home. ""Such meals reduce thermal regulation capabilities of the body, as it takes more energy to digest food. So, it is better to have light food at regular intervals,"" Dr Pandey said. Safe Club members will plan a session with their juniors before summer vacation to pass on the tips through a PowerPoint presentation. They also hope to rope in parents. ""From now on, we will avoid carbonated beverages because they have high sugar content. We have learnt that lassi, buttermilk and aam panna are better in summer because of their electrolyte content. We, as crusaders of Safe Club, will take the responsibility of educating our family and friends,"" said S. Hema, a student of Class XII. Classmate Simran Kaur added, ""It is better to drink water with a pinch of salt because salt has sodium. Also, one shouldn't drink water when very thirsty, but keep sipping fluids to keep oneself hydrated."""

They are likely to ship out another five to six lakh tonnes by the end of the season in September.The mills had exported 11 lakh tonnes in the 2014-15 marketing year (October-September), the Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma) said.In September, the Centre had directed the cash-starved mills to compulsorily export 40 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to clear the huge arrears to the farmers.The firming up of the global prices of the sweetener saw the stocks of sugar mills rally on the bourse.Abinash Verma, director-general of Isma, said besides a higher global supply deficit projected by the International Sugar Organisation, fears that top producer Brazil would divert more cane towards ethanol production this year aided the rally.The International Sugar Organisation forecast the global supply deficit for this marketing year at 5 million tonnes compared with 3.5 million tonnes announced in November, anticipating lower production in India, Thailand, Brazil and the European Union.Production in India declined for the first time this year with the output falling to 221.30 lakh tonnes till March 15 compared with 221.57 lakh tonnes in the year-ago period.

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working to support young cancer patients focussed largely on treatment, while nourishment was an unmet need, they said.Nutrition is the biggest unmet need of all cancer but more specifically childhood cancer. The treatment we offer to children with cancer is only effective when it is delivered on the foundation of right nutrition. In India, the children who reach hospital and get cured is 40-50 per cent on average while in the West its about 80 per cent, said Dr. Brijesh Arora, Professor in Pediatric Oncology and former convener of Pediatric Hemato-Lymphoid Disease Management Group at TMH.Every NGO wants to focus on treatment support, which of course, would cure the child with cancer but nobody addresses the need for right nutritional support, without which treatment cant be given. Cuddles is the only NGO which focuses purely on nutrition, he said.Cuddles Foundation provides butter and lassi to each child in the hospital to fill the gaps between their meals. The NGO also provides imported silicon feeding tubes, which can be kept in the body for six months as compared to the seven-day time span of Indian tubes.It also provides ration bundles including rice, wheat flour and other basic supplies to help families feed their children nutritious meals and stick with the treatment.At least 70 per cent of children seeking treatment are malnourished, said Purnota Datta Bahl, founder and CEO of Cuddles Foundation.TMH is the first hospital to use modified Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) for combating malnutrition, a supplement specially designed for children with cancer. It contains a good amount of protein because it has peanut butter, vegetable oil, special fatty acid, sugar and milk. It was never tried for cancer children. Through the nutritional intervention, the treatment tolerance, weight gain and quality of life of cancer children has improved. , said Dr. Arora."
58f5028460de470aa339e6f9,Damaging arrogance,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161214/jsp/opinion/story_124513.jsp,2016-12-14,"Participating last weekend in the Manama Dialogue, which has emerged as a central element in the Arabian Gulf's regional security architecture during the 12 years since its inception, I recalled a conversation among four leaders from three continents in a New York setting many moons ago. A meeting of foreign ministers of the Brazil-Russia-India-China emerging markets group had just concluded. Pranab Mukherjee from India, Sergey Lavrov of Russia, Yang Jiechi of China and Antonio Patriota, Brazil's ambassador in Washington, who later became foreign minister, were chatting, as they waited for the international media to arrive for their briefing in Manhattan's Millennium United Nations Plaza hotel. South Africa had not yet joined the group, so it was BRIC without the 'S' at the end, as the group's acronym is now famously known. During four and a half decades in journalism, I have mastered the professional art of eavesdropping on conversations by leaders: so I edged nearer to the four men, close enough to listen to what they were saying, at the same time staying as unobtrusive as possible in order not to attract their attention. Their conversation was fascinating. These leaders were not discussing policy or the state of the world, but were talking passionately about tobacco, cigars in particular. Mukherjee, who once had a trademark Dunhill pipe, was telling the other three top diplomats how he had kicked the habit, albeit with great discipline and difficulty. Lavrov, whose love for cigars and choice single malts I have witnessed often during the decade when he was the permanent representative of Russia to the UN in New York, was hanging on to every word that the then Indian external affairs minister, now president, spoke about how he quit smoking. How much he wished he could quit too, Lavrov, a chain smoker, was saying. Yang had tales to tell from the pages of history about Mao Zedong's smoking habit. Patriota, an untiring promoter of the abundance of good things from Brazil, was trying to steer the conversation towards caipirinha, his country's irresistible national drink made from cachaa mixed with sugar and lime. It was a moment to realize how personal friendships are born on the sidelines of serious diplomatic encounters and how they help smooth the conduct of often difficult state business. After all, it was a bond formed between Lavrov and John Kerry, the United States of America's secretary of state, over fireside drinks and garden strolls that enabled the two men to sit down at a Geneva hotel's poolside for several hours and finalize an agreement to dismantle Syria's chemical weapons arsenal even when the positions of the two sides appeared intractable. I recalled all this during last weekend because India was conspicuous by its damaging absence at this year's Manama Dialogue. For the record, India took part in the dialogue, but its presence went completely unnoticed by anyone who mattered at this impressive international gathering because, in an unedifying break from past practice, New Delhi was represented at a very low level. A joint secretary from the ministry of external affairs came from New Delhi along with the vice chief of naval staff, vice admiral Karambir Singh. The Indian ambassador to Bahrain, Alok Sinha, was added to the delegation as an afterthought. To pad up the Indian numbers, also as an afterthought, the name of Soman Baby, chief editor of Daily Tribune, an English daily in Bahrain, was added as a non-government delegate from India, when he should have been part of the Bahrain non-government delegation. A recipient of the Indian government's Pravasi Bharatiya Samman in 2009 for his contribution to the Indian diaspora in the Gulf, Baby is known as the ""Chronicler of Bahrain"" because he has been writing about the Gulf state since 1978, when he moved to Manama from India, and has been a pioneer of the media in Bahrain. That ought to make him a part of the participating group from Bahrain, not from India. India's low-level representation at this year's Manama Dialogue is a sea change from the past when Salman Khurshid as external affairs minister led the Indian delegation. Year after year prior to Khurshid's participation, the national security adviser used to be the head of the Indian contingent to this conference, which made international headlines this year because the US secretary of defence, Ashton Carter, the British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the German and French ministers of defence, Ursula von der Leyen and Jean-Yves Le Drian, respectively, among many others of similar rank, spoke at the conference and subsequently participated in the dialogue. Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, Senior Fellow for South Asia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London - the organizers of the Manama Dialogue - said that the Gulf states are looking for new partners in recalibrating their security architecture to meet challenges they have never faced before. India, on the other hand, is intensifying its engagement in the Gulf region and adding a security dimension to New Delhi's outreach in the Gulf. ""Venues like the Manama Dialogue offer ideal opportunities to flesh out ideas in this context,"" he said. Roy-Chaudhury, who was once deputy secretary of India's National Security Council Secretariat in the Prime Minister's Office, and is now an acknowledged expert on Indian maritime security strategy, said that the focus of this year's Manama Dialogue was Daesh, the so-called Islamic State, to which India has been paying close attention. The situation in Syria and Iraq - that was also the focus last weekend - is of much interest to India, which is re-engaging this region with ministerial and commercial visits. M.K. Narayanan, a regular participant in the Manama Dialogue when he was national security adviser, once sat in a villa at the Ritz Carlton - where the Dialogue takes place by convention - and had 14 bilateral meetings with his counterparts one after another. This year's Manama Dialogue saw the presence of a galaxy of top intelligence officials from across the globe, among them Prince Turki al Faisal bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who headed the critical Saudi Arabian intelligence apparatus before he took up his present job as chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies. India missed a rare chance to send its top intelligence operatives to informally interact with their counterparts from almost everywhere in the world under one roof. New Delhi's current attitude, which was explicitly conveyed to me by one official in so many words, is that the Indian government does not need the opportunities offered by such fora. ""We can do these things ourselves now from New Delhi without any help,"" said this official. Such an attitude smacks of arrogance never before seen in the annals of Indian diplomacy or in the Indian approach to national security. Sections of the National Democratic Alliance government may think that India has 'arrived' on the regional security scene in the Gulf, but notwithstanding such a misconception, if a choice is to be made between India on the one hand and the United Kingdom, the US, Germany or France, on the other, it is anybody's guess whom the Gulf states would choose. India should work with these Western countries in joint efforts instead of trying to do things alone. A little humility in this regard can do no harm. At any rate, fora like the Manama Dialogue offer opportunities that are unmatched during official, structured and formal bilateral interactions with Gulf states or others like Germany or the new, post-Brexit vote political set-up in the UK. The discussion about cigars at the BRIC meeting in New York is an example of what is possible when competent, high-level delegations are sent to international conferences. True, Sushma Swaraj was not in a position to be present in Manama last weekend because of her surgery, but the external affairs minister could easily have been replaced by the minister of state, M.J. Akbar, who also happens to deal with the Gulf. Akbar is eminently suited for such interactions, given his social graces combined with a deep knowledge of Islamic history and regional politics. As an Indian at the Manama Dialogue, I watched with envy how Singapore's defence minister, Ng Eng Hen (picture), was repeatedly buttonholed during coffee breaks, receptions and other informal occasions by ministers, intelligence officials and strategic analysts from all over the world. If Singapore is important because it is an island with a large non-Muslim population surrounded by Muslim-majority states, India is its large replica many times over. Akbar would have been sought after much more than Ng had he been sent to head the Indian delegation. Hopefully, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, will not repeat the mistake of India's virtual non-participation in such future events by the IISS and by other leading voices on global security.

But over the years, what we have seen is despite reducing blood sugar and controlling other risk factors like cholesterol, hypertension, weight and smoking, the risk of CVD remains high. That is why researchers took up a global study and the findings were presented at the recent annual conference of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), said city-based endocrinologist Mohan Badgandi, who is also a member of ADA.RecommendedPointing out that the new standard of care was the main discussion at the conference, Dr. Badgandi said endocrinologists from across the globe are now recommending wider use of the new molecule. The study has also been published in the September issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. All International Associations of Diabetes have complimented the findings of the study, he said.The global study involving 7,020 type-2 diabetes patients included 163 patients from India, including 23 from Bengaluru. Kidney disease affects about 50 per cent of people with type-2 diabetes, and people with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop CVD than people without it. This is because of factors such as such as high blood sugar, high blood pressure and obesity.Another city-based diabetologist, Aravinda Jagadish, said uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious complications such as CVD, kidney problems or other serious health complications. In our city, up to 40 per cent people with type-2 diabetes are also at risk of developing kidney disease, which can lead to kidney failure and eventually need dialysis. The new molecule is found to reduce the progression of the disease in patients, he said.Quoting the study, the doctors said, According to the trial, Empagliflozin reduced the risk for new onset or worsening kidney disease by 39 per cent versus placebo when added to standard of care in people with type-2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease.Conventional wayHave a glucose-centric approachResult in weight gain or help it remain neutralHypoglycemiaNew wayGlucose control and beyondReduce blood pressureLower risk of hypoglycemiaReduce cardiovascular disease riskSlow progression of kidney disease"

Thirteen of these segments are represented by the ruling AINRC, four by the Congress, five by the AIADMK and one by DMK.The rural segments in Puducherry played a major role in the victory of the AINRC during the 2011 Assembly elections.During the 2011 elections, the AINRC polled 31.75 per cent of the total votes and the Congress 26.53 per cent. The AIADMK and the DMK polled 13.75 per cent and 10.68 per cent votes respectively.Political observers say that the performance of parties in power and also the contributions made by candidates for developing the constituencies during the last five years will be in focus. The most important issue that is sought to be projected by the opposition parties would be the problem of rampant unemployment, price rise and shifting of industries to neighbouring states.The AINRC government has let down all sections of people, particularly Scheduled Castes, rural women and farmers. Large-scale unemployment, diversion of funds meant for SCs and irregularities in the implementation of public distribution system are the major issues that will dominate the campaign, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister for State V. Narayanasamy told The Hindu .The government has also failed to develop rural infrastructure such as roads, electricity and water supply. Most of the cooperative institutions, including cooperative sugar mills have become sick. Voters in Karaikal are seething with anger against the present dispensation and this will reflect in the polls, he said.In the rural segments, the AINRC is facing a strong anti-incumbency factor due to rampant unemployment and distressed farm sector. Farm workers have migrated to urban areas in search of employment.The national rural employment guarantee scheme could have at least helped the rural poor, especially women labourers, get few days of work, said R. Rajangam, secretary of the CPI (M). Against 100 days of work mandated under the scheme, the government implemented the programme only for a few days, he said.Problem of unemployment, shifting ofindustries likelyto be played up"

Increasing prevalence of asthma in the Western districts is due to industrialisation, urbanisation, air pollution and smoking, Umashankar of Erode, a doctor specialising in Pulmonary Medicine, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi, said.The dust particles and chemicals emanating from poultry farming, dying unit, cotton mills and sugar factory cause irritation of the lung airways leading to asthma.Long term exposure may lead to irreparable loss in lung function. Children exposed to tobacco smoking have reduced lung function and are predisposed to severe form of asthma, Dr. Umashankar, who is also consultant pulmonologist at Care 24 Hospital, Erode, said.Inspite of asthma being a common problem, myths and belief exist regarding the treatment. Indigenous oral medicines, fish treatment, and acupuncture that are being tried for asthma, have no scientific validation and not advisable, Dr. Umashankar said, explaining that disseminating information about the ailment is the main purpose behind observance of the first Tuesday of May as World Asthma Day.Asthma could be prevented through environmental measures like planting trees to reduce air pollution, using personal protective equipment (mask) in working places, and regular screening of the industrial employee.Inhaled steroids are the safest proven treatment and used across the world to treat asthma since the side effect are almost nil compared to oral medications. The treatment strategy differs for different age groups and has to be tailored by the treating physician, Dr. Umashankar said."

58f509417be9e018510a203f,‘Bad elements are in politics’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160312/jsp/odisha/story_74120.jsp,2016-03-12,"After former Congress MLA Ramesh Jenas arrest, you have said that criminals have been able to spread their network due to the patronage of police and the local administration. It has stirred a controversy in the state. Do you still stand by your statement? What is wrong in that statement? The whole world knows this bitter truth. But the context in which I have said that should be discussed. I made this comment in the context of the arrest of Ramesh Jena. People know that he has a criminal background and a number of cases are pending against him. I will be a hypocrite if I say that the local police did not have any idea about Jenas activities. How can a man expand his network without the knowledge of the local administration, particularly that of the local police? He is involved in all sorts of business, including tender fixing. Just tell me, do you believe that the Cuttack police didnt have any idea about Dhal Samant brothers activities? Are you of the view that criminalisation of politics is now a serious affair in the state? To some extent, yes. Many bad elements have entered politics. But our government is doing its best (to cleanse the system) and is taking action against criminals. Being a ruling party MP, should not you have raised this issue (Ramesh Jenas activities) before the district administration? There are many things that cannot be revealed to the media. If you intervene, people will say you are interfering in the affairs of the police administration. You cannot understand the helplessness of a politician. There is also another option  to go to the courts. But the cases will linger on for years. You should have the money to fight.I am not someone big enough who can do this. Dont you feel helpless that despite being an MP, you are not being able to rein in crime in your constituency? Before answering this, I want to take you back to the days of struggle for Independence. We had fought against the Britishers and thought that our people will be the police officers, judges and babus and they will rule us with a human touch. All the cases will be expeditiously solved. Has that happened? So, anyone can feel helpless. I am no exception. After your statement on Ramesh Jena, conflicting views came from within your party. One of your party leaders even said that if you had evidence, you should have gone to the police. It clearly reflects that there is an internal squabble within your party on this issue Its a question of survival of the fittest. So there is a mad race among the leaders. Inpolitics, both falsehood and truth exist side by side. This is there everywhere and in every party. But wont it affect the party? I have two sons and their aspirations and ambitions are different from each other. Sometimes it clashes, but that does not mean that it will harm the family. So, the conflicting statements, if any at all, will not affect the BJD. Dont you think that the party will initiate action against you for telling the truth in public and accusing the administration of colluding with the criminals? I think that much independence (to speak the truth) we all enjoy in our party. I have not said anything wrong and said nothing against any one.I have just spoken my mind. If telling the truth will cost my job, I am prepared for it. But what you will do after that? I am 68. If the party initiates action against me, I will go to my village and spend the rest of my life working for the local people. Ganjam is a crime-prone district. You are taking a stand against criminals. Dont you think that you are inviting risks? Rakhe Hari Maree Kie (If God saves you, no one can kill you). If speaking the language of the common man means risking your life, I am prepared for it (the consequences). You must be aware that five to six murders took place in Aska last year. The Congress alleged that Jenas arrest was made to demoralise their leaders ahead of the panchayat elections. They have demanded the chief ministers resignation over this issue The Congress is in the habit of saying such things. Do you think that with the chief ministers resignation, all these problems will be solved? Action should be initiated against corrupt officials including the police, because of whom the crime rate has shot up. But I must make it clear that there are many good officers because for whom the rule of law still prevails. In Ganjams BJD unit, former finance minister Ramkrushna Patnaik was known as the Ganjam tiger. Then former revenue minister Surya Narayan Patro called the shots. Now, law minister Bikram Keshari Arukh is the blue-eyed man of Naveen. Dont you feel that you have been neglected and not given the due recognition in the district politics? The party and the leadership have confidence in me. Whenever I feel there is any problem, I take up the issue with him (Naveen Patnaik). If that kind of equation you have with the leadership, why did not you take up Jenas alleged criminal activities with the chief minister? Its too small a matter... Its not a case fit to be taken up with the chief minister. You are representing Aska Lok Sabha constituency, which was earlier represented by the late Biju Patnaik and then Naveen Patnaik. People must be having high expectations from you? I am privileged to represent the Aska constituency. I am a common man. Even though I am a poor person, I always identify myself with the cause of the people. I always try to solve the problems of people to the best of my ability. You were denied the party ticket in 2009 general elections. Dont you feel that you became a victim of the internal politics of the partys Ganjam unit? No. I became a victim of my own foolishness. I dont want to blame anyone. You have come from a district where migration is the highest in the state. Why does it happen? The migration rate is the highest there as the problem of unemployment is very acute there. Not a single industry has come up in the district over the years. The only industry in the district is a sugar factory at Aska, that too, running on government subsidy. As the people are not getting employment, they are going in search of jobs outside the state. The BJD has been ruling the state for the last 16 years and Ganjam is also the home to the chief minister. Many stalwarts in state politics have come from the district. How come not a single industry has come up here? As one is in politics, its a bit tough to tell the bitter truth. The Tata project has still not materialised. Gopalpur port is yet to be converted to a big port. There are many reasons for it. Better not get into the details. You were a member of the Assembly and now you are in the Lok Sabha. How has your experience been in the two Houses? Why is it that your voice is not heard? We are a regional party. Our role is different. When any issue comes up pertaining to Odisha, we raise our voice. But, it does not get adequate space in national as well as regional media. At present, our role is to play that of a constructive opposition in national politics. However, in the Assembly, I had effectively raised various issues. VETERAN LEADER Swain, 68, hails from Kabi Surya Nagar He started in politics as a sarpanch and has held many important positions, such as panchayat samiti chairman and member of the zilla parishad An arts graduate, Swain was a member of the Assembly in 2004 He is interested in literature and in serving the downtrodden He is also a member of the parliamentary committee on rural development WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN IF NOT A POLITICIAN? I would have preferred to be a farmer. I started my career as a schoolteacher. But I lost interest after I found there was exploitation by the local school management committee. I was unhappy and quit."

Picture by Jai Prakash Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday shared the blueprint for implementation of country liquor ban from April 1 before complete prohibition is introduced in the state. Nitish announced that he would not step back from his commitment of total prohibition and would take every possible step for its implementation in a phase-wise manner. In the presence of thousands of women self-help group workers, Nitish said he did not speak anything just for the sake of saying. "" Main hawa mein baat nahin karta (I do not speak just for sake of saying). Many people say that I would not be able to implement the total prohibition but let me tell you that I would do it. It was my commitment and I want to say very clearly to all the district magistrates and superintendents of police that there should not be any laxity in the implementation of the new liquor policy from April 1,"" said Nitish on the occasion of Prohibition Awareness Campaign at SK Memorial Hall. During the prohibition day programme on November 26, 2015, Nitish had made the announcement to introduce prohibition in the state from April 1, 2016. He iterated that he would honour his promise made to the people of the state. Once again Nitish shared the programme of July 9, 2015, in which he had made the promise on public demand that if he be voted back to power, he would make Bihar a dry state. ""I remember, it was the same SK Memorial Hall, where I had made the promise,"" said Nitish. The chief minister said before taking the decision of making Bihar a dry state, he had taken every angle into consideration and the prohibition would be implemented in phase-wise manner. ""I have written to chief ministers of Jharkhand, Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to check illegal smuggling of liquor as our state is moving towards total prohibition. Several rounds of meetings have taken place between chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh and Sugar Mill owners. The mill owners have been instructed not to make spirit and start making ethanol which would be used in mixing it with petrol and diesel,"" said Nitish. Accompanied by excise, prohibition and registration minister, Abdul Jalil Mastan, and education minister Ashok Choudhary, the chief minister pointed out that to implement the prohibition, the police and administration are not enough until women participate. He instructed women to destroy illegal liquor vends in their villages. Mastan had announced cash rewards of Rs 1 lakh to women self-help groups affiliated to Jeevika (a government initiative for poverty alleviation) and all organisations that contribute to the cause. Nitish said: ""When liquor is sold through Bihar State Beverages Corporation Limited, all retail shops would under closed-circuit television camera surveillance to ensure transparency in its sales."" He said a toll-free number would be introduced on which women can call to inform about illegal sale of liquor in their respective areas. ""If police fail to take immediate action, then action would be taken against the police,"" warned Nitish. Apart from this, Nitish said he had asked the health department to open a de-addiction centre in every district so that people addicted to liquor could be cured. Before Nitish, director-general of police (DGP) P.K. Thakur said Bihar police had formed a flying squad team, which would keep a close eye on the smuggling of liquor, once the liquor policy is implemented."

58f50b157be9e018510a220b,Odisha to get dal from Delhi,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160401/jsp/odisha/story_77583.jsp,2016-04-01,"Bhubaneswar/Cuttack, March 31: The Odisha government today decided to procure pulses through Delhi-based National e-marketing Limited in view of the traders' threat to go on strike from tomorrow. The prices of essential commodities started rising after the traders had stopped booking of these essential items from outside Odisha. Retail prices of arhar dal has gone up from Rs 140 to Rs 160 per kg. Other dals, too, have recorded increase between Rs 20 and Rs 25. Sugar is being sold at Rs 40 a kilogram, an increase of Rs 4. Contingency measures to tackle the situation were discussed at a meeting today. Yesterday, talks with the traders failed after the Odisha government had expressed its unwillingness to waive value added tax (VAT) on the essential commodities as the Assembly budget session is going on. The government is now levying 5 per cent VAT on dal, wheat, wheat products and sugar. ""We will consider the demand after the budget session in May,"" said food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Das Burma, while appealing to the traders not to go on strike. Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangh secretary Sudhakar Panda, however, maintained that the government forced them to go on strike from tomorrow. Today, the Odisha government formed a panel, headed by the food supplies and consumer welfare secretary, to monitor the situation and take measures. However, Das Burma dodged repeated media query whether the Essential Supply Maintenance Act would be invoked against the traders. The Assembly today witnessed uproarious scenes over the strike with the Opposition Congress members urging the Speaker to ask the government to resume talks with the traders. Speaker Niranjan Pujari had to adjourn the proceedings several times in view of the noisy scenes. In another development, the traders at Malgodown, the largest wholesale market for essential commodities in Odisha, have joined the strike called by the mahasangh - which will have a great impact on the supply of essential commodities as there are around 800 traders, including 400 wholesales, there. At present, Odisha consumes about 67,000 metric tonnes (MT) of pulses and 12,000MT of wheat products every month and bulk of the commodities is procured from other states. ""There is no reason for panic for the consumers as there is adequate stock at Malgodown that can meet the requirement for over a week,"" said Cuttack district civil supplies officer Amar Mohapatra. ""Despite being a consumer state, the Odisha government has imposed 5 per cent VAT while no such tax has been imposed by over 26 states in the country,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafulla Chhatoi."

Smera is a joint venture of the Small Industries Development Bank of India, Dun & Bradstreet Information Services India and some public sector and private banks.The research report titled ""How safe are bank's assets"" analysed 3,424 corporate accounts across 20 sectors with a cumulative borrowing of Rs 36 lakh crore, with each account having a debt of at least over Rs 100 crore.The six sectors where the banks are facing the maximum stress are gems & jewellery, hospitality, infrastructure, steel, sugar and textiles. Out of these, only two are likely to remain stressed while four are expected to see a moderation in stress levels. The broad parameters that the rating firm considered include the demand-supply situation, cost structure, competition, government policies and financial performance.On the hospitality sector, Smera said, ""The gloomy global economic outlook is expected to affect the foreign tourist inflow resulting in low occupancy rates. Increasing dependency on relatively price-sensitive domestic tourist along with the need to stimulate demand shall adversely affect the average room rent thus preventing significant improvement in the operating margins.""In case of textiles, revenue growth is weak because of subdued demand, while under capacity utilisation and high interest cost have led to wafer-thin margins."

While the index of industrial production (IIP) rose 2.1 per cent in June 2016, compared to June 2015, it reflected a marginal uptick from the 1.1 per cent growth recorded this May.Inflation in the food category of the Consumer Price Index accelerated to 8 per cent in July from 7.5 per cent in June.Inflation in the housing segment remained flat at 5.4 per cent in July, while that in the fuel and light segment slowed to 2.75 per cent in July from 2.9 per cent in June. Inflation in the clothing and footwear segment accelerated to 5.2 per cent from 5 per cent in June.Inflation at the retail level has continued its upward march and it is essentially on the back of food inflation moving up, Richa Gupta, senior economist at Deloitte India said. Within the category of food inflation, upward momentum was seen in almost all the categories. It is important to note that inflation in cereals has further firmed up while pulses inflation has also moved up after a month of decline. Sugar prices and consequently inflation continued to move up as authorities focused more on exports.Expect inflation to remain high for another couple of months as the adverse base effect plays out, Ms Gupta added.Analysts said higher inflation will make it challenging for the Reserve Bank of India to meet its inflation target of 5 per cent set for March 2017.We are already at the higher end of the inflation target range of 2-6 per cent, and this number could move higher over time if the supply-side impediments are not taken care of, Ms Gupta said. As such, there is limited room for easing, if any.Industrial outputWhile the pace of growth (of IIP) still remains low, there was an improvement across the board, according to a report by Crisil. Not only manufacturing sector grew positively (0.9 per cent) for the second straight month, electricity and mining sectors too displayed better growth. Initiatives taken by the government to address the structural issues that impact manufacturing sector growth need to continue and stepped up to ensure that growth in manufacturing accelerates, A. Didar Singh, Secretary General, FICCI said.Electricity sectorThe growth in the IIP in June was mainly driven by the electricity sector, which grew 8.3 per cent in that month compared to 4.7 per cent in June. Manufacturing sector growth remained subdued at 1 per cent in June, up from 0.6 per cent in May. Activity in the mining and quarrying sector also picked up with the sector growing at 4.7 per cent in June compared to 1.4 per cent in May.The capital goods sector, however, contracted 16.5 per cent in June compared to a contraction of 12.35 per cent. The consumer durables segment slowed marginally to 5.6 per cent in June from 6 per cent in May.Above-normal monsoon, which could improve rural demand, along with the lagged impact of interest rate reductions, salary revisions and easier monetary conditions are expected to support demand in future and boost industrial activity, according to the Crisil report."

""We want the government to intervene and get the outstanding dues.During last fiscal alone, the outstanding dues of cooperative and public sector mills stood at `300 crore,"" he said. The farmers urged the state to increase SAP to `4,000 per tonne to sustain their livelihood.During the last session of the parliament, Union minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution C R Chaudhary said liquidity of sugar mills were adversely affected by surplus sugar production in the last four consecutive sugar seasons, over domestic consumption and depressed sugar prices. This resulted in accumulation of cane price arrears.TN Farmers' Association president K Balakrishnan said the acreage of sugarcane cultivation had halved in the state due to the ongoing crisis. ""The state minister promised to convene a meeting of farmers and mill owners and we repose faith in the government,"" he said.The sugar mill owners say they paid the Centre 's fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane to the farmers, which was based on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). ""Only the FRP has any legal validity and not the SAP,"" said a member of South Indian Sugar Mills' Association. Tamil Nadu fixes SAP that hovers around `550tonne higher than the Centre's FRP and it has been challenged in the Madras high court. The mill owners say that they are also plagued by issues like the dues TN Electricity Board owes them for the power produced by the mills."

""Everyone said it was a family issue and we shouldn't interfere,"" said Manjula.Recently, Manjula came in contact with volunteers from APSA (Association of People for Social Action) who, along with Soukanya, a gender-based violence project by St John's Hospital, are working to create awareness on domestic violence and training activists to intervene and stop violence against women.Manjula picked up courage and knocked on her neighbour's door a month ago. Aghast that the young woman was being beaten up by her mother over petty issues, Manjula spoke to the older woman and reasoned that the daughter was an adult who needed to be treated with dignity. ""For a month now, the beatings have stopped. I hope they won't resume. I feel bad that we accepted this violence. It's the same when husbands beat up their wives. Everyone ignores it, saying it's a family issue,"" she says.With an army of 900 volunteers in Jayanagar alone, APSA and Soukanya have been able to make a positive difference in 58 cases of domestic violence over the past three years.Direct intervention works best, and happens even as the violence is unfolding. ""We ring the doorbell and ask for some sugar or tea leaves or inform them of an overflowing water tank,"" laughs Manjula. ""'The best way to interfere is to distract them, while subtly reminding them that people are aware of what's happening,"" she says.In Jayanagar, 30 women have been given mobile phones by APSA. Women who face domestic violence can speak to these volunteers when in need of help. The volunteers guide them with regard to short-stay shelter homes, put them in touch with lawyers, free legal aid or police guidance.""Jayanagar is our pilot project. By this year-end, a similar initiative will be started in the slums of KR Puram, Mahadevapura and CV Raman Nagar,"" says Chitra, a field worker with APSA.The APSA-Soukanya tie-up came at a crucial stage in the evolution of APSA's one-and-a-half decade endeavour to make women financially independent in the low-income areas of Jayanagar. APSA formed self-help groups and got women to meet every week where they were told how to access banks and get loans, start a business and so on. ""The aim was to make women self-reliant and not leave them completely dependent on their husbands. Every week, the women would bring Rs 5-Rs 10 and this would go into savings. The women from the group could access this money as loans to start a business or for an emergency,"" says Chitra.Over the years, savings went up from Rs 5-10 to Rs 100-200. But financial independence did not exactly protect women from physical, financial and emotional abuse by their husbands.At a meeting of a self-help groups last week, Manjula, now a trainer herself, held up a picture of an angry man holding a black bottle and a dishevelled woman holding a purse, to evoke a spontaneous response from the group of 10 women present. ""We've all been through this when our husbands come home and ask us for money to buy a drink. If we refuse, we are beaten up,"" one of the women exclaims.""We did a survey, asking women whether it was fine for their husbands to beat them. Many women said when they didn't cook well or did something the husband didn't like, they deserved a beating,"" says Sheila Devaraj, programme coordinator. It's in this context that APSA's direct intervention in domestic violence began.APSA's empowerment endeavour has brought families together. With more women standing up for their rights and their husbands sobering up, life in slums is also improving.Savitri is a beneficiary who says the family is happier now. Savitri left her husband Subramani eight years after marriage. ""He was an alcoholic who would only meet me to make me pregnant and disappear. The self-help group helped me raise my three children, including giving me a loan to treat my daughter who had a heart problem and died a few years ago. He didn't even come home then,"" she recalls.Savitri worked as a domestic help and housekeeping staff in many commercial establishments in Jayanagar and raised her children. Three months ago, with family elders intervening, Savitri and Subramani got together. ""He wanted me to leave Jayanagar and live with him elsewhere. I refused. I told him I had survived without him, why should I leave everything and go with him when I had barely seen him in the past 16 years? He saw sense in what I said, and moved into our house,"" she said.In the past three months, she has seen a change in him. ""He drinks less, is more responsible about the needs of the family, especially the children. I took a loan from the self-help group and bought him an autorickshaw so he can make a living as well. We are happier,"" she says.Earlier, children would drop out in class 7 or 8 due to family problems or to take over family responsibilities, or simply because they were affected by problems at home. Today, some children are doing engineering or are in college.Chitra | Field worker with APSABefore APSA, I thought the only right a woman had was the right to vote, because I've been hearing of it since childhood. I never thought about the other rights a woman may have, like the right to good health, to express myself without fear, or my children's right to education.Manjula | Trainer with APSA"

The payment was made at the prevailing state advisory price (SAP) of Rs 280 per quintal. Of the total, six mills alone are in the communally sensitive west UP, 13 are in central UP and five in east UP.Though number of mills in west UP are relatively smaller but they contribute maximum to sugar production in the state. The six mills together had to make a payment of Rs 618.23 crore, while the 13 in central part had to pay Rs 975.60 crore. Likewise, the five in east UP paid dues of Rs 218.09 crore.UP Cooperative Sugar Mills Federation managing director BK Yadav said that the payment was made in July. ""Sugar production was good and we managed to place it properly in the market and got good revenue. The payment was subsequently done to the farmers,"" he said, while speaking to TOI.But the same is not the case with 94 private mills defaulting on payment of dues to the tune of over Rs 2,700 crore. In fact, sugar mills including Modi, Simbhaoli and Mawana are defaulting on payment of between Rs 310 crore and Rs 380 crore, each. Latest figures show the private sugar mills were required to pay Rs 16,099.08 crore, against which it has made a payment of Rs 13,386.87 crore. This accounts for 83.15% of the total payment made towards the impoverished cane growers.The Akhilesh Yadav government had been making a pitch to get cane dues cleared by July. On June 21, Akhilesh made the promise days after exodus in west UP's Kairana district was reported. His promise, sources said, was aimed at pacifying the restive population in the communally sensitive region which also contributes significantly to the state's sugar production.Cane department sources said repeated reminders were sent to the millers in the past but to no avail. ""We have also been issuing challans against the defaulting millers,"" said a senior official in the department."

58f51190a3d24b0b70c1ce82,Tough contest in AIADMK stronghold,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tough-contest-in-aiadmk-stronghold/article8572227.ece,2016-05-08,"Sholavandan, the only reserved constituency in Madurai district, has many distinctions to its credit. Apart from comprising Alanganallur and Palamedu, places renowned for jallikattu, Sholavandan is considered the most fertile part of the district famous for cultivation of betel leaves, paddy and sugarcane.The constituency also contributed to the first electoral victory of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the 1973 by-election for Dindigul Lok Sabha seat. Since then, Sholavandan has remained a stronghold of the AIADMK, which has won five of the nine Assembly elections since 1977, often with huge margins.However, the perceptible disappointment against incumbent MLA M.V. Karuppaiah of AIADMK, combined with persistent issues of steady decline in farming, water scarcity in certain areas and lack of alternative employment, are likely to result in a close fight in the upcoming election.Even AIADMK cadres acknowledge the anti-incumbency sentiment as evident from the stiff opposition recently faced by the party campaigners in Irumbadi village, a bastion of AIADMK, where a hospital was promised but not started.Despite being a fertile region, many pockets in the constituency appear to reel under acute water shortage, particularly of drinking water. Sholavandan and nearby places do not have water shortage. But it is a serious problem in areas such as Vadipatti, Alanganallur and Palamedu, says A. Nagaraj, a farmer from Palamedu. We are buying water from trucks once in four days by paying Rs. 5 per pot, he adds.While farming in these regions has sharply declined due to water scarcity and lack of irrigation projects, the situation is not all that rosy in Sholavandan and nearby areas, which receive water from Periyar irrigation system. Betel cultivation is no more profitable. Only the older generation is involved as they have no other choice, says S. Karuppiah of Sholavandan.Cane supply dwindlingSugarcane cultivation, considered relatively profitable, has also come down over the years. The National Cooperative Sugar Mills located in the constituency, which saw supply from more than 15,000 acres in the past has now declined to just about 5,000 acres, says Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Growers Association president N. Palanichamy, adding that the key reasons are declining water resources and inadequate support price.The decline in agriculture, however, has not been accompanied by avenues for alternative employment. Companies in the textile park in Vadipatti prefer to employ mainly women for low wages, says M. Ramesh from Vadipatti, stressing the need for more small and micro industries in the region.Despite being predominantly rural, the town panchayats of Vadipatti, Alanganallur, Sholavandan and Palamedu are also in the unfortunate position of being ineligible for many government welfare schemes, which could have helped in providing employment.Just because of the classification as town panchayat, we are not eligible for 100-day work scheme (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme) or free distribution of goats and milch cows, says K. Rajkumar, a ward councillor from Palamedu.Certain regions in the constituency have also remained tense. There was a recent instance of violence by caste Hindus against Dalits in Kuruvithurai.There are hardly any problems in places where Dalits reside separately in hamlets. If they reside closer to caste Hindus in the same village, the situation is mostly volatile, says A. Murugan, a caste Hindu from Irumbadi.While the ban on jallikattu is an emotive issue in this constituency, it is not likely to favour or go against any party since every party is assuring to work towards revoking the ban. It is perhaps after sensing the anti-incumbency factor that AIADMK has denied ticket to Mr. Karuppaiah and instead fielded K. Manickam here. The DMK camp also had its share of controversies in Sholavandan by replacing Dr. Sripriya Thenmozhi with C. Bhavani, raising some dissenting voices in the party.Eye on Dalit votesWhile DMK is likely to reap a majority of the votes of Devendrakula Vellalars with Puthiya Tamizhagams presence in the alliance, VCK, which has fielded R. Pandiammal as part of DMDK-PWF-TMC alliance, is aiming to capture a portion of it, apart from consolidating the votes of other Dalit communities, who are considerable in size in this reserved constituency."

About 3,372 societies in Kolhapur, 935 in Satara and 759 in Sangli are currently non-traceable or non-functional or have stopped its daily functioning, but remain on paper.Kolhapur district, known has bastion of cooperation movement in the state, has reported the maximum number of such fake cooperative institutes that are without address or non-functional. The information was revealed in the status report of the cooperation department compiled at the division level, a copy of which is with TOI.The state cooperation commissioner has surveyed 12,461 cooperative societies in this region. All these surveyed cooperative societies are only credit cooperative, agriculture and non-agriculture cooperative societies. The cooperative sugar factories, cooperative dairies, and fishery developing societies are not part of the survey. It was conducted by different departments.The state government has ordered the district deputy registrar in each district to survey cooperative societies and submit a report of such societies. These missing or fake cooperative societies are allegedly used for siphoning of loans and funds from various developmental. Once the final report is submitted to the state, these cooperative societies will be liquidated.Rajendra Darade, divisional deputy registrar of the department said, ""Since April 2015, we have accelerated the drive and asked all the officials to prioritise the drive which will ultimately result in cleaning up the cooperative sector. Due to such cooperative societies, the entire sector has earned a bad reputation. We have started the process to close fake cooperative societies.""Sources close to the development said that there have been several cooperative societies in these three districts that were formed only for political gains, as having control over cooperative society helps the political leaders control rural population, which is largely dependent on such micro-financing institutions. Cooperative societies play key role in various elections and in some cases, these societies are misused for diversion of loan amounts, funds by making fake documents and false proposals.The cooperation movement started in the pre-independence period came as an institutional network of mirco-financing the rural population which was then solely dependent on agriculture sector. The movement was in a way came as decent exist for some surplus population to go for micro-financing, running a small scale business or industry and reduce the burden of the population on the agriculture sector, which was hardly showing any growth.But the movement did not get necessary support from the policy makers in the following years mainly after the independence and job creation process of cooperation got halted after certain extent. As the cooperation movement was primarily led by political leaders of Congress, their descendants inherited the legacy, and it got fiercely opposed by other aspirants who were keen make their own space for political career."

While diabetes rate has increased by around 45% globally, it has jumped 123% in India between 1990 and 2013, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.The cost of diabetes care, including direct as well as indirect costs as loss of production, was pegged at Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2010 and has been rising significantly over the years. Pointing at rising costs, fewer generic developments, limited competition and huge mark-ups by pharmaceutical companies in the insulin space, the Lancet study says, ""Substantial attention has been given to the issue of access to medicines for communicable diseases; however, access to essential medicines for diabetes, especially insulin, has had insufficient focus.""Highlighting the factors affecting affordability, the study says one possible explanation is the market domination by three multinational companies, which control 99% of the global insulin market in terms of value and 96% in terms of volume.Insulin is used by all people with Type 1 diabetes and up to a quarter of those with Type 2 disease to control blood sugar and regulate metabolism.In India, most of the insulin that is used is imported. Doctors say hike in prices of insulin is also largely driven by its indiscriminate use by doctors, apart from active promotion of newer first-line insulin by various pharmaceutical companies.""Cost of diabetes care is vastly increased if a patient is taking multiple insulin injections. This cost is almost quadrupled if the latest insulins are used.Importantly, these costly insulin, now aggressively pushed in Indian market, offer no advantage to low-cost previous generation insulins in most cases.Indian physicians should keep this in mind that while treating patients on costly multiple drugs and insulin regimen,"" said Dr Anoop Misra, Chairman, Fortis CDOC hospital for diabetes and allied specialities.The Lancet study also warns against the rapid rise in the use of analogue or synthetic insulin, causing animal insulin to vanish from the market.According to Dr Vijay Viswanathan, Head and Chief Diabetologist in Chennai's MV Hospital for Diabetes, the cost of old medicines or insulin usually remain the same with very slight annual increase, but it is the new patented ones which affect the cost of care immensely.Data show diabetes is now also among the top ten reasons for various other disorders among both men and women as it breeds obesity, obstructive sleep apnoea, severe kidney and lower urinary tract infection, stroke and many other diseases. It can also have adverse effect on eyesight.According to the study, rising insulin costs threaten the health of poor residents even in the richest nations."

""In contrast, BGR-34 not only controls blood sugar but also provides nutritional supplement to the diabetics,"" he added.However, Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant physician, Maxcure Hospitals, Madhapur, said that affordable allopathy anti-diabetic drugs like Teneligliptin (generic name) are also available in the market. ""These allopathy drugs may cost Rs 7-8 per tablet,"" he said."

While the number of cases of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has consistently grown since then, the number of dialysis machines at the premier medical institute remains the same.Transplant, a definitive treatment for kidney failure, has picked up but the lack of donors has come in the way of meeting the demand.The situation in other government hospitals in Delhi, including Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung and Lok Nayak, is equally bad as they have failed to increase the number machines to cater to a high number of patients.On the eve of World Kidney Day on Thursday, doctors said preventing the causative factors, primarily diabetes and hypertension, as well as timely diagnosis are the only ways to stop the threat that kidney diseases pose.""No amount of infrastructure development can bring a dramatic change in the situation given the high disease burden. We run the dialysis unit 24x7. Still, only a few can be treated while most patients are left to fend for themselves after the initial dialysis because we cannot provide lifelong services,"" said Dr Sanjay Agarwal, professor and head, department of nephrology at AIIMS. Almost 7,000 patients visit AIIMS every month, of which 50% are with CKD.Patients with failed kidneys require lifelong dialysis, which, in simple terms, means cleaning waste products from the organ. It costs nearly Rs 25,000 per month in a private facility. People who can't afford this rush to government hospitals. ""There are total 33 dialysis machines in the Delhi government-run hospitals. A few more have been installed on the public-private partnership (PPP) model. But that is not enough to cater to the high demand,"" said a health department official.The central government in the Union Budget proposed to open dialysis units in all district hospitals but experts have raised doubts over the availability of specialists to treat patients. ""India has only about 1,400 nephrologists and they are concentrated mostly in cities. We need to train more physicians to treat such cases,"" said Dr Dipankar Bhowmik, professor of nephrology at AIIMS.For now, focus must be on creating awareness about the disease and pushing those in the high-risk category for regular screening to ensure early detection of CKD, he said.""We come across so many diabetics who get their sugar levels checked 50 times a year but they don't ever feel the need to get urine test done. They should be told about the importance of the latter to detect kidney disease at an early stage,"" said Dr Sanjeev Gulati, head of nephrology at Fortis. Those with a family history of kidney failure, recurrent urinary tract infection, diabetes and hypertension must get themselves tested periodically, he added.An ongoing survey led by AIIMS across eight cities has revealed that 10% of Indian population has some or other form of kidney disorder."
