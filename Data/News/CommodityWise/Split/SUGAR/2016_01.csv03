Taking to arms after the British forces killed her husband, Velu Nachiyar formed an army in alliance with Hyder Ali and attacked the British in 1780.Having inherited the legacy of the 18th century brave queen, the district, with the Sivaganga Lok sabha constituency, shot into the limelight when former Union Minister P Chidambaram, who held the Home and Finance portfolios in the Union Cabinet, was elected for record seven terms.Three centuries down the line, Sivaganga is bogged down with an array of civic and drinking water problems and relegated as a backward district with no industrial development and agricultural growth.Paddy, plantain and sugarcane are grown in the constituency but farmers find agriculture less remunerative in the absence of assured irrigation facilities. They demand that the districts credit of water from Vaigai dam be revised. As per the existing arrangement, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram share the Vaigai water on a 2:3:7 ratio respectively.More than 70 per cent of the population depend on agriculture and a large section of sugarcane growing farmers have almost given up cultivation as sugar mills have failed to clear their dues for long. The constituency is blessed with the finest graphite reserves and people regret that there are no ancillary industries to exploit the reserves and provide employment opportunities.Sivaganga is dominated by Mukkulathors, followed by Dalits, Mutharaiars, Chettiyars and Yadavas. Major political parties have made it a point to field candidates from the dominant community. Incumbent CPI MLA S. Gunasekaran, who got elected in 2006 and 2011 with the support of DMK and AIADMK respectively, is sweating it out for a hat-trick on being fielded by the DMDK-PWF-TMC combine.The DMK and AIADMK, which had allotted the seat to their allies in the last two elections, have fielded candidates making the contest tough.The AIADMK has nominated Sivaganga Panchayat Union Chairman G. Baskaran and the DMK, former Kalayarkoil Panchayat Union Chairman Sathianathan alias Meppel M. Sakthi.The Pattali Makkal Katchi and Indiya Jananayaka Katchi have fielded candidates in the multi-cornered contest. The All India Forward Bloc leader Sridhar Vandaiyar has also entered the fray and he is likely to cut into the Mukkulathor vote bank."

All beings are part of the infinite consciousness. Krishna draws a parallel between the role of the infinite consciousness that is operative in all created beings in the entire universe and that of the individual consciousness in every jivatma that is responsible for the functioning of the body-mind complex. Understanding this subtle truth is the key to realisation is the basic teaching of the Gita, said Swami Gautamananda in a discourse.Like the flywheel in the factory that is activated by electrical power and whose working is essential to empower all the other machines for various purposes, the very presence of the self is the cause of the working of the body-mind complex in individuals. All activities in the factory such as crushing sugar cane, extracting and purifying the juice, etc, are possible because the flywheel keeps running, though it does not by itself crush the sugar cane or extract the juice. Likewise, the very presence of the self is the cause of the workings of the body-mind complex.The mind, buddhi, ahamkara, chitta, and all the sense organs are able to function because of the self. A realised soul understands the supreme state of the individual self and learns to remain distant from the body. He is able to view the subtle self as different from the body though both seem to be inseparable in an individual. The referees presence is indispensible in any game, though he does not participate in it. He permits the acts and gives consent. The self is the cause for the individuals life and acts but is untouched by the joys and sorrows experienced. Krishna terms the self a witness or an upadhrishta."

What was once made in abundance, is now consumed in smaller portions. ""With rising health awareness people are very particular about what they consume and in what quantity,"" says Manjushree Kulkarni who supplies snack items on order. ""People now want homemade quality and do not mind the high prices at which these products sell,"" she says. ""There is high awareness about trans fats so reused oil is a big no and customers insist on sweets made in pure ghee instead of vegetable ghee,"" Kulkarni added.Chakli, ladoo, anarsa, karanji are as essential as lights and crackers during Diwali . But like crackers, which are down to a whimper thanks to environmental concerns, the snacks too are being shorn of salt, sugar and oil. ""Many customers tell us to use less oil in chakli dough. They say they don't mind if it is a bit tough to bite but we should not add too much oil to make it crispy,"" says Jyoti Deoghare who has been in business for past 10 years. Even sweet items have taken a hit. ""Karanji and anarsa are not very popular as they are deep fried and a lot of sugar goes into it,"" says Deoghare.Even the size of laddoo and chakli has shrunk. ""People ask for half a laddoo and the other half goes waste, so it's best to make smaller ones,"" feels Shubhangi Kane who runs a small business of supplying these snacks. ""Now, though salt is less in chakli but customers ask for garlic to be added as it makes chakli easy to digest. Many feel that adding dry fruits in laddoos will make them unhealthy and there are also those who insist that dates and dry fruits should be used in abundance,"" Kane added.Health is an obsession these days and the focus is on low fat sugarless items, says Nirali Niraj Jain who conducts cookery classes. ""I give options like cookies instead of anarsa and khajoor ki mithai which contains natural sugar. Dark chocolates are considered healthy too,"" she said.""Traditional snacks can't be given a miss during Diwali,"" says businesswoman Roma Pande. ""We also have to send them to homes of our friends and relatives so they have to be made in abundance. But, nowadays they are not totally consumed though they have a long shelf life,"" she said."
58f51bc3a3d24b0b70c1d664,Reforms are here to stay,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Reforms-are-here-to-stay/article14511027.ece,2016-07-27,"Mid-1991 saw a new dawn in the economic history of India. The country then faced a severe economic crisis, triggered largely by an acute balance of payments problem. The response to the crisis was to put in place a set of policies aimed at stabilisation and structural reform. While the stabilisation polices were aimed at correcting weaknesses that had developed on the fiscal and balance of payment fronts, the structural reforms were meant to remove rigidities that had entered various segments of the Indian economy and to make the system more competitive and efficient. Thus the crisis was turned into an opportunity to effect some fundamental changes in the content and approach to economic policy.Break with the pastThe break with the past came in three important directions. The first was to dismantle the complex regime of licences, permits and controls that dictated almost every facet of production and distribution. Barriers to entry and growth were dismantled. The second change in direction was to reverse the strong bias towards state ownership of means of production and proliferation of public sector enterprises in almost every sphere of economic activity. Areas once reserved exclusively for the state were thrown open to private enterprise. The third change in direction was to abandon the inward-looking trade policy. By embracing international trade, India signalled it was boldly abandoning its export pessimism and was accepting the challenge and opportunity of integrating into the world economy.The genesis of reformsOn the genesis of reforms, some interesting questions have been raised. First, several people have been curious to know the role of P.V. Narasimha Rao in the reform process. Was he an ardent advocate or a reluctant reformer? Second, were the reforms of 1991 a continuation of a process that had already begun in the 1980s or did they truly constitute a break? Third, since the leaders and bureaucrats involved in the reform process were themselves part of the earlier control regime, what compelled them to change their approach? How much of the change was influenced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral institutions?Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister spearheaded the new policy. He articulated the need for change and provided not only the broad framework but also the details of the reforms. It was, however, Rao as Prime Minister who provided the valuable political support and shield which were very much needed. It must be noted that as Prime Minister, he also held the Industry portfolio which was directly responsible for initiating changes that led to the dismantling of various types of controls and licences relating to the industrial sector. This was indeed a key element of the reform programme.The Eighth Five Year Plan, in the writing of which I had a role, spelt out in some detail the rationale for reforms. Rao, as Chairman of the Planning Commission, had read the draft and approved it fully. However, as a matter of strategy, he couched the reforms in a language which would appeal to the old guard of his own party. There is no doubt that reforms could not have moved forward without his solid support and conviction.The 1980s saw some important changes in economic policy. A number of committees were set up which recommended changes for improving the functioning of the economy. But most of these recommendations were still within the framework of an overall system of controls. What was attempted was only a relaxation of controls such as raising the threshold for licensing. They were largely incremental in nature. On the other hand, the reforms of 1991 moved away from the control regime and offered a consistent set of measures covering various segments of the economy in line with the new approach.What changed the mindset of the people who initiated the reforms was the enormity of the crisis of 1991. Indias foreign exchange resources had fallen to a level equivalent to only three weeks of imports. The possibility of default loomed large. It became obvious that business as usual would no longer work. We had to move fast and make fundamental changes in our economic policy. It was true that at the time we were negotiating with the IMF and other multilateral institutions. Obviously they had their own bias. They were in favour of a competitive economy with minimal controls. But the decision we took to introduce reforms was entirely our own. The credit goes fully to our leadership.Questions on the reform processIn the first three years after reforms were launched, there was a flurry of activity. Reforms covered all key sectors such as industries, external trade, foreign investment, exchange rate system, banking, capital market and fiscal and monetary policies. The impact was quick. Growth started picking up. The balance of payments situation improved and confidence in the economy was restored. It was good that successive governments have adhered to the reform path. The pace of reform has, however, varied over time. Nevertheless, what stands out is that growth since the reforms has been faster. Between 2005-06 and 2010-11, the average annual growth rate was 8.8 per cent. While the decline in growth rate seen in the last few years needs careful analysis, reforms have to be an integral part of any programme aimed at accelerating growth.On the progress of reforms itself, two questions from two opposite angles have been raised. First, how far have we come in fulfilling the original goal of liberalisation? How much more needs to be done? The second question is, how much of the benefit of growth has gone to the lower deciles of the population? Has there been a perceptible impact on the vulnerable and weaker groups?As reforms progressed, more and more sectors of the economy were brought within the ambit of liberalisation. However, there are still some segments which are subject to controls reminiscent of the pre-1991 period. A good example is the sugar industry. Agriculture too as a sector needs special attention. Reforms of the agricultural marketing system are overdue. The country is yet to emerge as a single market. Administrative reforms need to be pursued with urgency. Thus the scope for future reforms is still wide.Despite faster growth, India still ranks low in the Human Development Index even though the country is classified as a medium human development country. There is, however, evidence that poverty is coming down. Whatever level of private consumption expenditure is used as the cut-off, the poverty ratio is falling. Having said this, one must recognise that the poverty ratio is still high and we are lagging behind in meeting the Millennium Development Goals on several dimensions. Growth does help in reducing poverty because of both the percolation effect and the ability to raise more resources on the part of the government to provide for increased social sector expenditures. Therefore, a twofold strategy is needed: letting the economy grow fast, and focussing on targeted programmes to help the poor and disadvantaged.Thus the emphasis on efficiency does not mean ignoring concerns relating to equity. As the role of government as a producer of marketable goods and services goes down, its role as a regulator and provider of public goods and services increases. In fact, even in the provision of public goods, different combinations are possible. Public-private participation can combine the efficiency of the private sector with larger public policy concerns.Reforms have come to stay. There is a fair measure of agreement across political parties on the need for reforms. However, individual measures may run into problems. This is inevitable in a democracy when conflicting political pressures are at play. Persuasion and consensus-building are qualities which political parties in power must nurture and cultivate. Reforms are the first important step towards raising the growth rate. But as our experience over the last few years shows, reforms alone are not enough. They must be supplemented by a proactive government which is focused on development and not distracted by other considerations.C. Rangarajan is former Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister and former Governor, Reserve Bank of India.A twofold strategy is needed now: letting the economy grow fast and focussing on targeted programmes to help the poor and disadvantaged"

To safeguard the trees and maintain diversity, a group of people in the city have started to sow palm seeds along the bunds of water bodies to strengthen tank bunds across the district. In the past two months they have sowed more than 120 palm seeds.Environmentalists say the tree can survive any weather condition and is ever green.The practice of planting palm trees was followed in the ancient times also. The idea was to prevent water bodies breaching in the rainy season and also to safeguard the trees which have a unique drought-resistant quality, said K C Neelamegam, secretary of 'Thanneer', an NGO functioning from the city.""We began the project on July 24, 2016. We have so far collected 300 seeds for this purpose and 120 seeds have been planted on the bunds of the Mavadi Kulam in the city with the help of college students and like minded people. We have named this mission 'Vidhaigalai Thedi' (in search of seeds),"" he said.According to available data, there are five crore palm trees in Tamil Nadu, half of them in Tirunelveli, Tuticorin and Ramanathapuram districts, followed by Salem, Chengalpattu and Sivaganga. Trichy has the least number of palm trees among the southern districts.And the number is decreasing drastically, Neelamegam said. ""Once a large number of palm trees could be seen around Sathanur, Thuvakudi, Olaiyur and Suriyur.""A farmer can extract 13,500 litres of juice from one acre of sugar cane, whereas it was 50,000 liters in the case of palm trees, he said adding that every part of the tree was useful. Palm products has medicinal value and have been used in the Indian systems of medicine such as ayurveda and sidddha. Thousands of people survived on the produce of this tree.Experts say that, however, extensive planting of palm trees can cause an adverse effect on the environment as it has the capacity to turn the land into a desert. Trees eliminate pollution, purify the air, provide oxygen, consume carbon dioxide, reduce heat and dust on the ground, regulate suspended particulate matter, reduce wind velocity, noise and global warming. But planting palm trees alone will not solve this purpose.Monoculture of trees is not advisable as there should be diversity, they say."

While such patriotic calls aimed at targeting Chinese economy may not have the desired effect so soon, history books re veal that a similar movement had actually left Junagadh state financially paralyzed when its Nawab had refused to accede to India.One of the most potent weapon during the `Arzi Hukumat movement', the campaign against Junagadh Nawab`s decision to merge with Pakistan, was economic boycott of the state. The details have been revealed in a book `Saurashtra no Itihas' (History of Saurashtra) penned by histo rian S V Jani. In fact, special boycott committees were constituted in various cities across India, which strategically planned the economic collapse of Junagadh state.Junagadh is gearing up to celebrate the Arzi Hukumat Day to commemorate Junagadh liberation and accession to the Indian Union ""Among three major strategies adopted by freedom fighters led by Gandhiji's nephew Shamaldas , economic boycott was adopted as a tool to corner Nawab's state. In fact, the special `economic boycott department' was set up and headed by Pushpaben Mehta.Boycott committees were set up in Calcutta, Mumbai, Madras, Cochin, Malabar and other cities of the country ,"" writes Jani. The committees shot off letters to various institutions which obliged by stopping supply of crucial commodities like petrol, kerosene, garments, sugar and grains to Junagadh. The Indian government stopped supplying coal from October 1, 1947.""The strategy paid off. The railway's daily income plummeted from Rs 30,000 to Rs 5,000 per day and residents, majority of whom were in favour of joining India, stopped paying taxes,"" said Jani in his two-volume book. Of the total 222 princely states in Saurashtra, Junagadh was the biggest with an annual income to the exchequer to the tune of Rs 86 lakh-Rs 90 lakh. Finally , left with no options, Junagadh declared its accession to the Indian Union on November 9, 1947. When Junagadh's economy got weakened due to boycotts, the Nawab turned to Pakistan for help. However, Pakistan demanded money for supply of essentials, which he couldn't afford, said Jani."

Accordingly, the factories were supposed to pay 80% FRP to the farmers as first instalment.As per the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, the pending FRP amount has to be paid with interest to the farmers. The interest amount has been estimated at Rs 103 crore for Kolhapur district alone, which has posed problems before the factories, who had expressed inability to pay FRP at once.The Aurangabad division bench of the Bombay high court recently ordered the state government to pay interest on the remaining FRP amount to the farmers. At present, case-by-case hearings of sugar factory representatives and farmers' demands are being addressed before the state sugar commissioner in Pune.Sugar production in the country as well as in the state has increased in the last three years. However, the international market during the same period remained sluggish leading to over-stocking of sugar. The unsold sugar led to the sugar factories' funds getting stuck for longer period.Raghunath Patil, leader of Shetkari Sanghatna from Sangli, said, ""The sugar factories used the opportunity to pay less to the farmers and ensured that its blame would go to the state government. It is true that the sugar factories are in trouble but the condition has been never so bad.

""If excess sugar is not exported, the prices will fall and farmers will have to bear losses,"" said cooperative minister Chandrakant Patil.""Last year, the state produced 105 lakh metric tonne sugar and of that 14 lakh metric tonne remained unsold. This year, about 85 lakh metric tonne sugar is expected to be produced in the state. However, prices will fall if the current stock is not exported and it will hurt the farmers,"" said Patil, adding that the export will benefit farmers as in Brazil, sugar season is yet to begin.Justifying the rising retail price, Patil said, ""Retail price may go up by about Rs 3 per kg, which should not affect people much. But this small hike will bring much relief for farmers.""He said that sugar production was 25% less compared to last year and is likely to come down by 50% next year.

ISMA proposed that the government should allow using 25 kg sugar instead of 16 kg to get 40 kg of molasses. One tonne of sugarcane crushing produces 40 kg of molasses.Shamrao Desai, founder of the Sanghtana, has written a letter seeking the minister's attention to farmers losses if the ISMAs proposal is accepted. ""For sugarcane farmers, billing is directly linked to sugar recovery from crushing. If they allow an increase in sugar in the molasses, we would get less recovery. While factories can earn a substantial amount by selling ethanol to the oil companies, they never extend this benefit to farmers. Minister Pradhan while assuring ISMA has not understood the farmers losses,"" said Desai.Different types of molasses can be produced from sugarcane factories, such as unclarified molasses, high-test molasses, A molasses, B molasses, C (final) molasses and syrup-off. The B-heavy molasses is used to produce ethanol at present.""ISMA claimed that the sugar industry is in difficulty and they need to produce more ethanol which can be purchased by the oil companies. Instead of allowing increasing percentage of sugar in molasses to produce ethanol, we propose that they produce ethanol instead of sugar. That would be beneficial for the farmers,"" added Desai, who is also a bio fuel expert.He sought the union governments attention to the earlier NDA governments commitment to produce ethanol instead of sugar from the sugarcane crushing. According to Desai,""the rate of one litre ethanol is Rs 48.50 at present. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured the farmers in Punjab that he will frame a policy to make ethanol from maize corn. The sugar industry is in desperate need of such a policy"".The programme to mix ethanol extracted from sugarcane molasses began in 2003 with a view to cut India's dependency on imports to meet its oil needs. However, against the requirement of a minimum 120 crore litre of ethanol to meet the mandatory 5% blending, only 30.6 crore litre was produced in 2011-12 which dropped to 15.4 crore litre in the following year, Pradhan had recently said. While 5% blending was mandatory, the programme called for raising the level to 10%."

But overcoming the phobia and undergoing a successful surgery of the cancerous tumour can be considered as half the battle won. Call it 'half the battle' because, getting completely cured of cancer is a long-drawn process spanning from two to five years after surgery.Therefore, post-operative care and support is of utmost importance because the chemotherapy and radiotherapy sessions are not just painful but financially and emotionally taxing as well. Challenging the deadly disease and seeking a complete cure from it is a multi-modality approach involving various medical disciplines depending on the type of cancer and the stage they are in.But in general, for most kinds of cancer, post-surgery, one needs to look into aspects such as reconstruction of the operated area, nutritious diet, light exercise, physiotherapy, supportive treatment, regular follow-ups, counselling and so on, say medical experts. Cancer patients who are diabetic or obese have more painful repercussion to cytotoxic drugs and have to be given supportive medicines to minimise their effects.Dr N Sujatha, head of the department of oncology at King George Hospital (KGH), explained, ""After a month lapses post-surgery, for the next eight months to one year, usually patients undergo chemotherapy, followed by five weeks of radiotherapy if needed. The gap between each chemo and radiotherapy session is three weeks. The hormonal treatment goes on for five-eight years. For the first two years, every two-three months follow-ups to the doctor is a must as risk of recurrence is very high during this period. As years pass, follow-ups can be reduced and after five years, the risk of recurrence becomes negligible.""During this period, patients have to exercise caution and care as head of the department of plastic surgery at KGH Dr P V Sudhakar said, ""After surgical removal of the cancerous tumour, patients often undergo reconstructive surgeries, which has to be done taking care of the functional and aesthetic aspects especially in case of oral and breast cancer. Depending on the type of reconstruction (tissue or implant), massaging of the scar or entire area is needed. Since breast cancer patients suffer from lymphedema (swelling of the entire upper limb due to removal of lymph tissues), they require physiotherapy and should wear pressure or compressive garments from knuckles to shoulder. Local measures such as applying moisturiser at the site of surgery and radiation should also be done to prevent the area from drying up and one should avoid exposure to infections.""Coming to the diet, patients are advised less spicy and non-fried food, avoid sour food and sugar too (if overweight or obese). Diet should be high on protein. Outside food is a strict no-no, added the oncologist Dr Sujatha.Regular psychological counselling is another aspect that should be considered. A psychiatrist and resident medical officer (RMO) at KGH Dr B Bangaraiah, advised, ""Cancer is such a disease that changes the patient's psyche. Phobia that one may not live long, trauma and depression are usual fallouts besides the cosmetic changes like hair loss induced by cytotoxic drugs during chemotherapy. This post-surgery depression needs to be treated with counselling and anti-depressants and cognitive therapy. Family support and staying stress-free during the post-operative months is important. Therefore, patients should engage in some hobbies that they like to do, try out light workouts, yoga and meditation."""

Both were produced before the MCOCA court in Nashik, which remanded them in seven-day police custody, said public prosecutor Ajay Misar. The suspects will be produced before the court again on February 9.He said investigations are on for the last few days. At present, the suspects' links with the scam are being established and the government needs some time to gather data and interpret it, he added.The food and civil supply department had on January 25, 2015 unearthed misappropriation of nearly 3,000 metric tonnes of foodgrains and sugar worth Rs 5.06 crore meant for the beneficiaries in Surgana tehsil that was allegedly sold in the open market.It was alleged that the good grains from the Food Corporation of India that should have gone to Surgana taluka between July 2014 and September 2014 had not reached the destination and instead siphoned off by the transport contractor in connivance with the supply officials and godown keepers.Jain and Shevale have been accused of diverting some 2,400 tonnes of foodgrains and selling it in the open market.Police officials said a cartel of traders and foodgrain suppliers was working in Nashik and Mumbai and the cops already had inputs about the diversion. They were waiting for some solid evidences to move ahead.According to the police, Jain and Shewale had earlier issued demand drafts worth Rs 3.25 crore in the names of three firms which were allegedly owned by the same person. This raised suspicion among the police that the accused might be involved in fraudulent dealings. Accordingly, the Nashik police repeatedly summoned the suspects for questioning, but failed to turn up. When the suspects were in Nashik on Wednesday, the police immediately arrested them after gathering sufficient evidence against them.Though the diversion of foodgrains could not take place without the support of government officers in the PDS, the police have not taken any names so far.Since the last three years, the state government has been trying hard to bring reforms in PDS to avoid diversion of foodgrains from fair price shops to the open market. Plans such as installing GPS on the vehicles, streamlining them from godowns to the fair price shops and mobile-based tracking system have received stiff opposition from the lobby of PDS officials, foodgrain suppliers and transporters."

But it was not alcohol that scarred 41-year-old Rajesh Pillai's liver, say those close to him, but his apparent fondness for another drink -a carbonated beverage.While the real cause of his liver failure may remain in the realm of conjecture, doctors say they would not be surprised even if it a cola claimed Pillai's life.The impact of liquor on the liver is well documented but there is little awareness on aerated drinks causing the same effect if taken in higher proportion, too frequently, they say .The sugar in aerated drinks gets deposited as fat in the liver. Over a period, it causes a condition called fatty liver, usually associated with obesity and alcohol consumption, said transplant surgeon Dr Vivek Shanmugam. He said at least eight of the 10 patients he sees have fatty liver, some as young as 15-16.When the fat continues to be deposited in the liver over a long period, the organ gets inflamed and leads to a condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). ""The condition can be reversed if the person has a healthy diet. If left unattended, it could cause scars in the l ive r, "" s a i d D r A n a n d Khakhar, programme director, Centre for Liver Disease and Transplantation, Apollo Hospitals.Aerated beverages contain sweetening and colouring agents and caffeine that could meddle with the body's metabolism. ""Caffeinated carbonated beverages also act as a diuretic (increases production of urine) and actually deplete bodily fluids, making you more thirsty than actually quenching your thirst,"" said nutritionist Meenakshi Bajaj. Studies have shown that caffeinated beverages are also mildly addictive. Bajaj said unlike popular notion, cold fizzy drinks do not help beat the heat.

It has proposed a 20.5MW bagasse-based cogeneration plant.The transmission line is critical for transmitting the power generated from this plant to the MSETCL grid. In phase-I, 12MW of power generated by the cogeneration plant would be transmitted to the grid.Petitioners Vinayak Anand Tambe and others claimed that the authorities of the sugar cooperative executing the work in its capacity as transmission licensee and MSETCL had deviated from the consolidated sanctioned map to ensure that the towers erected for the line did not pass through lands owned by influential farmers, but through plots belonging to small and marginal farmers.They contended that the Pune SDO, despite being aware of the sanctioned map, went on to pass the impugned (under challenge) order of injunction against them. Moreover, they stated that the MSETCL did not follow the due process like giving an advance intimation to the petitioners regarding proposal for the hight tension line, survey of land for the same purpose and inviting objections, if any.Apart from the Pune SDO, MSETCL's executive engineer for high tension construction work and Ghodganga sugar cooperative's chairman Ashok Pawar and managing director Sambhaji Patil are named respondents in the matter.MSETCL's executive engineer Mahendra S Katange, who filed an affidavit in the high court earlier this month seeking dismissal of the petition on various grounds, confirmed the court's stay order on the project.Ghodganga sugar cooperative chairman Ashok Pawar said, ""We have invested close to Rs100 crore in the cogeneration plant, which will be providing electricity to MSETCL's transmission grid. Our role is confined to executing the work as a transmission licensee, while all the planning and sanctioning for the transmission line has been done by the state transmission utility.""He said, ""The claims made by the petitioners are not in tune with the factual position. Since the matter is sub-judice, I won't be able to speak much before it is settled by the court. MSETCL has planned the transmission line as per legal provisions."""

Shetti alleged that Patil is protecting sugar mills operators for some unknown reasons.Speaking on the issue on Sunday evening, Shetti said, ""The crushing season began in November 2015 when sugar prices were low. The situation was similar in the previous year as well. Hence, I was ready for splitting the sugarcane purchase payment to the farmers on 80:20 formula. The authorities approved that 20% of the amount would be paid in the next couple of months as per the FRP formula. By the end of February, the sugar prices started soaring in the wholesale market. It clearly means that sugar prices were high enough and the sugar mills can clear the farmers' dues.""""But there has been hardly any development on the issue.

The outfit frequently resorts to agitation for better sugarcane prices. The current trading rates of sugar are Rs 3,500-3,600 per quintal.

She had to undergo a caesarean surgery and the baby was born with shoulder dystocia which causes injury to neck of the infant during delivery.City gynaecologists report a higher incidence of pregnancy-induced diabetes, or gestational diabetes, among young women in urban areas mostly due to undisciplined lifestyle, improper diet and lack of exercise before and during pregnancy.""The diabetes that women get in the sixth month of pregnancy is called gestational diabetes. Usually when pregnant women come for treatment we check for blood sugar and ask them to follow a certain diet and exercise. Also, pregnant women should not have sweets regularly. This pregnancy-induced diabetes is seen more in urban areas compared to rural areas,"" said Dr Shubha Rama Rao, head of OBG department at St Martha's Hospital.

Fat acts as a natural insulin resistant which increases the risk of diabetes, so obese women are more prone to GDM. Risks of GDM increases with age, so it is advised to conceive by late 20s or early 30s. Also, those with polycystic ovaries have greater chance of acquiring gestational diabetes.""She further said, ""We always ask expected mothers to go for a single-step blood sugar test immediately after conceiving and another mid pregnancy, after 5 to 6 months of conceiving. If it's not controlled, 30% of women affected by GDM tend tow develop type 2 or adult diabetes.""Dr Vidya Desai Mohan, senior gynaecologist at Manipal Hospitals, said, ""The hormonal changes in the body make pregnant women easily get diabetes. Women who have the tendency to get diabetes or who are in the borderline will get diabetes easily at this juncture. If they don't change their lifestyle, particularly their diet, it may become uncontrolled. In the last decade there has been a significant increase in the cases of pregnancy induced diabetes.""The risk is huge, she said adding that such babies are usually born obese or may develop obesity later. If diabetes is not controlled, there is a chance of the woman giving birth to a large baby. Sometimes the shoulder of the baby would be large which will increase the chances of C section deliveries.

The best example would be that some of our colleagues who could afford legal fees went to courts and were awarded decrees in their favour even after which it did not translate into actual dues, thereby making a mockery of our justice system. Others are still fighting for their dues in the winding up petitions in the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court,"" the letter said.Asserting that there were about 7000 direct as well as indirect employees who were affected by the closure of Kingfisher Airlines, the employees in the letter said that the majority of them cannot even afford to fight it out in the courts, adding that their attempt to appeal on humanitarian grounds was even opposed by the councils of various parties including the banks.The employees go ahead to say that they have lost all hopes as he legal system has failed them miserably and as a result 'the common, law abiding citizens are suffering and bearing the brunt of it'.""On behalf of all the employees of erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines we request you for your immediate intervention in the matter helping us recover our hard earned dues,"" the letter said.Appealing to the government if it can pay the dues of the employees 'Ex Gratia' and recover from the company and the management of KFA along with the dues of the banks, the employees stated that there have been instances in the past where the government has paid the employees be it in the times of sugar cane mills or cotton industries.""Sir the govt has enough avenues to recover the dues and can afford the unfortunate delay that it would take now. But the employees cannot bear any further delays. The whole world seems to have forgotten about us and misplaced its priorities in larger scheme of thoughts when it comes to banks and others,"" the letter said.In conclusion, the employee's reiterated their plea for a government intervention to secure their rightful and legitimate dues at the earliest as ""justice delayed would be justice denied""."

This time, the harsh summer has aggravated their woes. Anjaneya R, a farmer leader from Kolar, said the groundwater level in his village has fallen to 1,500 feet, and various governments are sleeping over their appeals. ""These elected representatives have enough time to discuss trivial issues like luxury watches. They don't have the guts to face farmers when they cover long distances and come to Bengaluru to air their woes,"" he added.Farmers in Kolar and Chikkaballapur had observed a day-long bandh in December last year, as well as under the banner of Shashvatha Neeravari Horata Samiti, demanding permanent measures to tackle the perennial water problem. ""So far, we've got just promises. There have only been talks about bringing water to arid regions from rivers like the Netravathi in the Western Ghats. However, we don't see it happening anytime in the near future, and even if it's implemented, there is little hope as the project would benefit tail-end farmers,"" said Dhananjaya Reddy, a farmer from Chikkaballapur.Sugarcane farmers have been waging a long battle with sugar mills and the state government, which owe them money for cane purchased. Kurbur Shanthakumar, president of Sugarcane Farmers' Association, said the state government is sitting on Rs 500 crore of farmers' money for the year 2013-14. ""Even for the financial year 2014-15, an amount of Rs 350 crore is pending. Farmers who've spent huge amounts on the crop are in deep trouble. Many of our farmers, who are in debt and facing repayment pressures, have committed suicide and such cases are on the rise,"" he added. Sugarcane farmers had staged a huge protest in Belagavi last year, when the legislative session was going on there.Kodihalli Chandrashekar from the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, said the state government just can't keep running away from the problem of farmers. ""Instead of beating the protesting farmers, the government should have sent ministers to listen to their problems. When children of farmers are suffering without proper water to drink, they don't have any choice but to protest,"" he added."

The survey dew sharp criticism from activists who claimed that the day-long survey had grossly under-reported the numbers. This compelled the state to conduct the survey for the second time in October. However, this time again, it was marred by controversies, forcing the government to go for another round. Finally, the third survey was held between January 15 to 31 which reported just about 10,000 out-of-school children.Deepak Nagargoje, an activist from Beed, said, ""The latest survey finding about 10,000 out-of-school children in the state is nothing but a joke. The survey has been marred by controversies since it started last year. And even after three attempts, the government has failed to give us a realistic picture.""The 2011 Census indicated that 4.96 lakh children in the state were working as labourers. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan report in 2014 reported 1.85 lakh out-of-school children. The Tata Institute of Social Sciences reported 38,000 students living on streets in Mumbai alone in 2014. The number of children working at construction sites was reported at 31,000 in Maharashtra while children of sugar cane and brick kiln workers together came to three lakh in the state.""All these figures reported by the government departments and non-governmental organisations are mind-boggling. There is major mistake in the survey,"" Nagargoje added.Heramb Kulkarni, an education activist, said there could be many more out-of-school children who were not covered in the survey. ""Government has framed policies for every issue in the education sector but hasn't ensured proper implementation of the same. There's lack of awareness as well as co-ordination among different departments of the government. Many local authorities, who are the first point of contact in case of any problems with the implementation of RTE, are still not aware of all the guidelines.""The RTE Act, 2009 mandates that all children aged between 6 and 14 years should be enrolled in schools, show regular attendance and get a formal education. The state's survey was prompted by this mandate and the need to find out the actual number of out-of-school children.Kulkarni said there was lack of awareness among general public about their right to education."

Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is also pushing for sugar export despite the international market being sluggish. Factories have said such lower rate of export would not benefit them.In a meeting held in Mumbai on Monday, Fadnavis again stressed export of sugar. He said if sugar is not exported, then there will be surplus stock in the domestic market which will lead to fall in prices. This will eventually result in sugar factories and farmers incurring losses.""The Union government has asked every factory to export 12% sugar of its last three years' average production. But the decision would affect the sugar factories in Marathwada as their production has drastically dropped in the current year. The average sugar production figure is higher and if Marathwada factories export as per the quota, the remaining sugar stock will be very low. Sale of such low stock in the open market would not able to recover a factory's running cost,"" said state rural development minister Pankaja Munde.Sanjeev Babar, managing director of Federation of Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd, said, ""The current sugar export price is Rs 2,300 per tonne and no factory is keen on exporting at such lower rates. The rates should be at least Rs 2,600 per tonne. Moreover, the state government is also not supporting sugar factories in terms of soft loans. It is true that we can export sugar till September this year, but we have to make payment to the farmers and factory employees.""""Ethanol is a key by-product of sugarcane and its current market rate is Rs 48 per litre. It is a good rate but orders worth Rs 38 crore litres have been issued. The payment for these orders is made after the entire delivery. The factories not having distilleries would not benefit from it. Same is the case with co-gen projects because power purchase rates are good and it would benefit only factories having such plants. Most of the plants are in Western Maharashtra. Hence, these factories can afford to export sugar at lower rates,"" he said.""Sugar production has gone up in the last three years in the state. The unsold sugar stock has piled up and put pressure on the factories. The central and the state government provide some financial assistance to the factories, but it has limited reach. Had the government increased its assistance, the factories would have been able to sell sugar in the market. The major buyers of sugar, beverage and confectionery makers, have already purchased their stock. Hence, there is little scope of the local market looking up,"" he added."

The ratio of expenditure on production and income has gone berserk due to this. At the same time sugarcane crushing has suffered due to unavailability of water leading to cut in sugar production. To compensate the losses suffered by the factories, we have asked the government to restructure the loan sanctioned to ensure FRP to farmers, said Sanjeev Babar, Managing Director, Maharashtra State co-op Sugar Factories Federation Limited.On Wesdnesday a delegation of the federation met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis who has agreed to forward their plea to the Centre.The sugar production in the state has been on the decline for the last two years and is expected to be very low next year.In 2014-15, the sugar production was 105 lakh tonne, which came down to 83 lakh tonne. Due to worsening drought the production next year is expected to be only 45-50 lakh tonne.According to Mr Babar, the area under sugarcane cultivation too has reduced by over 3 lakh hectare and is expected to shrink further.Last year the total area under cultivation was 9.27 lakh hectare, which has come down to only 6.30 lakh hectare this year, he said.The current retail price of sugar stands at around Rs 35-40 per kilogram. There will be slight increase, but it wont go beyond Rs 50, Mr Babar added.Commenting on the drought situation and allegations against the sugar industry of indiscriminate use of water for the sugarcane crop, the federation has clarified that it supports the installation of drip irrigation facilities in the fields.According to the members, the state gets Rs 840 crore in the Sugar Development Fund (SDF) through excise duty on sugar. We expect the government to provide 50 per cent subsidy on installation of the facility and rest money can be raised in the form of loan by farmer, said Shivajirao Nagwade, President of the federation.Meanwhile, all sugar factories will be contributing Rs 10 lakh to the state governments drought relief fund. Additionally, Rs 15 lakh will be spent on ensuring water conservation works in the areas adjacent to the factories."

But during BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure or during the past two years of the Modi government, no one could accuse any of the Ministers of corruption. Only the NDA can provide corruption-free governance. In the Agusta Westland scam, even an Italian court had said there was massive corruption. Our government will expose and punish those responsible for this. I want to ask the Left leaders why they are silent on this issue, said Mr. Singh.He said the people of Kerala have been wishing for an escape route from both the LDF and UDF fronts. But they did not have an alternative.Now, for the first time, even political analysts are acknowledging that the BJP-led NDA had emerged as a third political force in Kerala."

But what helped Mohammed's quick diagnosis was his extremely low birth weight of 1.76 kg.Paediatric intensivist Dr Javed Ahmed, who examined the baby when he was rushed from a local nursing home to Surya Hospital in Santacruz, said, ""When child is born with low weight, doctors conduct a series of tests. His sugars were abnormally high, suggesting an infection."" But a series of tests done at Surya Hospital pointed to neonatal diabetes.The hospital sent his samples to Exeter Hospital in the UK for a definite diagnosis. ""But we found that the child didn't have the common mutations that lead to neonatal diagnosis,"" said paediatric endocrinologist Dr Sudha Rao. So far, he hasn't tested positive for four of the 17 mutations that Exeter Hospital offers. ""In the last 15 years, I have seen five to six cases of neonatal diabetes. This child is unique because he wasn't really premature,"" she added.Unfortunately for the child and parents, the tests established that he couldn't be given simple insulin tablets, but would need shots.""We have taught the mother to give him the injections, but it is emotionally taxing and they have found a neighbourhood doctor for the purpose,"" said Dr Rao. Shabina takes her tiny tot to the doctor twice daily for the shots.Chennai-based diabetologist Dr V Mohan said his hospital now has a registry of 200 children with neonatal diabetes. ""We offer a panel test of 25 genetic mutations that cause neonatal diabetes,"" he said, adding that increasing awareness about the condition has led to children being diagnosed within a a few days or weeks of birth.Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which high blood sugar levels are high over a prolonged period. Permanent neonatal diabetes, which refers to the onset of diabetes before the age of six months with persistence through life, is a rare disorder occurring in one in 0.2-0.5 million live births.Significant advances in elucidating the genetic basis of neonatal diabetes have been made since the initial description in 1995.Dr Rao, who is also attached to Wadia Hospital in Parel, said that neonatal diabetes has emerged as an independent entity in the last decade. ""As children with high sugars don't grow well, it's important to get their blood sugars within control. However, as children can't follow a diet or timings, it takes a while to decide on their insulin dosage,"" she said.As for Mohammed, his insulin shots have now been fixed at two a day."

Those above 60 years constituted 21.99 per cent of the city's diabetic population.HYDERABAD: The average Hyderabadi is not in the pink of health according to revelations made by a massive diabetes screening programme that found 21.14 per cent of the city's population to be diabetic.The most shocking finding of the screening was that 20 per ent of people suffering from diabetes were not even aware of their condition while a majority of the remaining 80 per cent were not doing enough to manage their blood sugar levels.Carried out under an initiative called 'Together let's beat diabetes', Apollo Sugar, a chain of diabetes management clinics, found that 7,839 (21.14 per cent) persons in the city were diabetic. The results emerged after a random blood sugar screening programme was carried out in which 37,075 persons (including 8,259 women) participated between November 15 and January 16 in 34 centres across the city.Reacting to the results of the screening, Dr Sanjoy Paul, senior consultant diabetologist, Apollo Sugar, Jubilee Hills, said, ""The findings are on expected lines. The condition of people in the 41-50 year bracket and 51-60 year bracket can be categorized as either 'age-related diabetes' or 'lifestyle-induced diabetes', and can be attributed to various factors like stress, lack of diet control and lack of exercise.""Speaking about the reasons for diabetes among 1,786 diabetic persons in the 31-40 year age bracket, Dr Paul squarely blamed factors like night shifts, late dinners, stress and oily food. ""Close to one-fifth of all adults in the world are diabetic. About 72 million diabetic people live in South-East Asia - out of which 65 million people live in India. This number is expected to grow to 110 million by the 2035 in the absence of effective prevention and management programmes,"" said Gagan Bhalla, CEO, Apollo Sugar.In light of the findings, experts have called for urgent preventive measures. ""Steps to prevent diabetes can be broadly classified into two: Diet management and exercise. The first step requires that people mainly avoid food with a high glycemic index.

Sheshadri said the system increases sugar recovery percentage of the crop, which is a main parameter in deciding the procurement cost. This is in addition to the increase in crop yield and reduction in water consumption by 40 to 45 per cent. Despite benefits, drip irrigation in the Cauvery command area has been poor compared with the Krishna basin. At present, only about 1,000 hectares of sugarcane fields have been covered under drip irrigation in the Cauvery basin. Of this, the universitys demonstration plots account for 250 to 300 hectares, he said.In the conventional system, farmers stop giving nutrients to sugarcane crop after 14 weeks. But the drip irrigation system coupled with fertigation (supplying liquid nutrients through drip irrigation) method will help in giving nutrients even after 14 weeks, leading to better quality of crop and increase in sugar recovery percentage, Mr. Sheshadri said.At present farmers are getting an average yield of 45 to 50 tonnes of sugarcane from an acre in the Cauvery basin. It was possible to increase this to an average level of 65 to 70 tonnes through drip irrigation and fertigation, he said.Drip irrigation in the Cauvery command area has been poor compared with the Krishna basin"

A middle-income family spends an estimated 18% of family income on the disease. The findings are from a study conducted by the department of endocrinology at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS). The study examined the direct cost associated with management of type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in patients attending the diabetes clinic at the institution which caters to a large part of North India and Nepal . T1DM mainly afflicts children.After examining 88 patient families for a period of one year, the researchers found that families had to spend Rs 27,915 per annum on the management. The patients were aged 3-39 years.The amount is considerable for patient families hailing from middle or lower socio-economic classes. The burden was heavier because 81% had no access to government subsidy or medical insurance. The largest expenditure was on home glucose monitoring (40%) and insulin (39.5%). Principal researcher Prof Eesh Bhatia said that cost coming in the way of treatment was a harsh reality doctors in endocrinology department face everyday.""Complications arising out of re-use of syringes, skipping a dose of insulin or irregular blood glucose monitoring leading to hospitalisation are common. Everything comes down to cost and parents express helplessness,"" he said adding, ""seeing the financial inadequacy is extremely depressing."" The cost of treatment is a bigger issue if people have to depend on private sector for blood sugar monitoring strips, insulin and tests. The study found that buying strips for sugar level monitoring formed the largest chunk of expenditure. An SGPGI versus market comparison suggests that the cost of treatment in the private sector would be four times higher.In SGPGI's pharmacy, a single strip costs around Rs 7-8 but in the private sector, a buyer will have to pay anything between Rs 20 and Rs 25. The cost of insulin is also about 45% higher in the market. ""Lowering the cost of essentials needed in type-1 diabetes management is the only relief,"" co-author Prof Vijaylakshmi Bhatia said.In their paper, the researchers have noted that though the epidemiology of type-1 diabetes is not well-studied in India, a report from Chennai estimates the incidence to be 10.5 per one lakh per year. The number of patients is high considering that 45% of India's population is below 19 years of age. Some 3-5 lakh persons in India suffer from type-1 diabetes. Over 25,000 cases are added each year.About the reason for undertaking the study, Prof Eesh Bhatia said, ""Everyone knows that the cost of treating and managing type-1 diabetes is high and incurs a huge burden on patient families. But none can quantify. We decided to find out the exact extent of problem so that policy makers may be approached on their behalf.""The researchers have called for support in buying of insulin and glucose testing strips."

Even if the parched area receives good rainfall the government and the administration must ensure that every drop of water is conserved. Also, it is important to decide the cropping pattern and curb sugar cane cultivation. There are lessons to learn from this year's drought and if we fail to do so, next year we will face a similar situation.""The study, conducted by advocacy group South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), has observed that Marathwada region cultivated sugar cane, a water-guzzling crop, in face of drought. It claimed that if 50% water being used to cultivate sugar cane in the region was diverted to produce pulses, it would mean livelihood security for over 21 lakh farmers as against 1.1 lakh sugar cane farmers supported as of now.Experts point out that there is no system in place with either the state water resources department, agriculture department or local self-governments to enforce water and crop planning decisions. Existing laws, such as Maharashtra Irrigation Act (1976), Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Act (2005) or Groundwater (Management and Development) Act (2009), that have clear provisions of restricting perennial crops in drought-affected areas, are not being implemented.According to the United Nations (UN), there are seven billion people to feed on the planet today and another two billion are expected by 2050. It's estimated that every person consumes between two and four litres of water per day.Most of the water consumed is embedded in the food people eat. For example, producing one kilogram beef requires 15,000 litres of water, while producing a kilogram wheat requires 1,500 litres.""Drought is not about deficient rainfall, it is about deficient planning. Every year, the government talks of sustainable a plan to tackle drought and all these plans are washed away by the first rains of monsoon. Nobody is really bothered about water until the next drought"" said activist Sampatrao Pawar. He added that the government must involve local governing bodies and other agencies to monitor water usage as well as cropping patterns.As populations increase, especially in dryland areas, more and more people are becoming dependent on fresh water supplies in land that are becoming degraded and aren't sustainable.Water security, like food security, is becoming a major national and regional priority in many areas of the world, the UN study report states.RELATED STORIESMarathwada +BACKGROUND X Rain has wrought peril upon this Pune village This month, there was heavy rainfall for two days and there have been hardly any showers for the last seven to eight days, said Zanjare who has a degree in agricultural science. (Representative Image) An increase in massive downpours has completely altered farming in Malin village in Pune district, and made daily life a precarious affair.Once, rain was a consistent pitter-patter on the roof over several months, says Sanjaykumar Zanjare, an eight-generation farmer here. Now it is more likely to be heavy spells of incessant rain within a span of a few days or weeks.This month, there was heavy rainfall for two days and there have been hardly any showers for the last seven to eight days, said Zanjare who has a degree in agricultural science. The erratic rain, resulting run-off and soil erosion have compelled far mers to stop cultivating many crops, including finger millet (nachni), urad and paddy, says Zanjare, who owns 18 acres of land.Then there's the danger: Two years ago, on July 30, a cloudburst triggered a landslide in the Wester n Ghats, destroying homes and taking lives--including Zanjare's grandmother. This is one of 20 villages that have been identified as at risk. Villagers also have to grapple with increase in temperature during summer. As in other places, poorly planned development has added to the problem. Deforestation has reduced green cover in the area. ""Earlier, it would not be so hot during summer as the forest cover would protect us from the heat. Now, there is a perceptible rise in temperature,"" he says. ""The uprooting of trees also loosens up the soil, leading to frequent landslides during heavy rainfall.""These perilous weather changes have compelled the villagers to suggest safety measures in and around their houses.""We have to raise a safety wall for those living close to hillsides.Besides, houses need to be built on extra solid and robustly moulded plinths and the roofs need to be strong enough to stand a heavy downpour,"" said Zanjare.TERI projects minimum temperatures to increase particularly in Pune, among other places, which will have an adverse effect on some crops. While extreme rainfall is not expected to go up here as much as in some other districts, deforestation in the region and treacherous hill topography makes even small increases important.RELATED STORIESPune division +Maharashtra, including Mumbai, is set to get significantly warmer and wetter in the next few decades, according to projections by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), which could have profound implications for crop growth, water resources, and disease.Temperature is expected to rise by 2030. But there will also likely be greater climatic variations across the state - which means different regions will have different experiences.Northern Maharashtra is projected to see many more extreme rainfall events, whilemay see a rise in dry spells. Average temperatures could go up the most in parts of Vidarbha and Marathwada. But parts of the Konkan, including Mumbai, are likely to see the greatest increase in minimum temperatures.These projections are part of a climate study commissioned by the state government in 2010 and submitted by TERI in 2014 but only recently made public. Climate modelling was done in collaboration with the UK Met Office to predict temperature and rainfall for 2030, 2050 and 2070 compared to 1970-2000.The analysis projects that annual mean temperature will go up by more than one degree Celsius across the state by 2030, with the western parts of Vidarbha, northern Maharashtra - includes Nashik, Dhule and Nandurbar - and Marathwada seeing the biggest increase.In these regions, annual mean temperatures could go up by as much as 1.4 1.6C compared to increases of 1-1.2C in the Konkan and Pune regions. Maximum temperature increases follow a similar geo graphical pattern.On the other hand, south-west and north Maharashtra will see some of the biggest increases in minimum temperatures. That means that south Konkan, as well as Mumbai, Thane, and parts of Nashik, will have noticeably warmer nights in the near future.The study predicts that minimum temperatures will rise more than maximum, shrinking the distinction between day and night. This closing gap is significant because it leaves less time for the land to cool down, says Suruchi Bhadwal, associate director of the earth science and climate change division at TERI, New Delhi.""Usually, because land temperatures cool off in the night, it takes a certain amount of time in the mornings for temperatures to go up again. Now it will take less time and temperatures will go up further,"" she says. This cycle of warming will be especially painful for cities like Mumbai where concrete development and lack of green cover boosts local temperatures further. Demand for electricity will likely increase--life will get harder for those who have no recourse to fans or ACs.Winter is also warming up, notwithstanding cold spells. ""So there's no break from summer to winter,"" notes Bhadwal.In coastal districts, as well as parts of Vidarbha, humidity could make things worse. These areas score worse on the heat index, which combines temperature and humidity.In the longer term, temperatures will rise even more, the study predicts, with mean temperatures touching a 3C rise by 2070 in large parts of the state. In some areas like Vidarbha, minimum temperatures could rise by as much as 3.5C by 2070.However, researchers caution that longer term scenarios are very difficult to predict.The number of extremely low rainfall days is projected to rise most sharply in south-central Maharashtra, ie parts ofand Marathwada. Storing water will be more important in these areas to tide over the dry days.But there will be an overall increase in monsoon rainfall in parts of north and northeastern Maharashtra (Amravati and Nashik divisions). But much of this increase seems likely to be in short, intense bursts. The number of extreme rainfall days (calculated as rainfall intensity 99% higher than the baseline period) is predicted to increase across the state, especially in northern Maharashtra, including Jalgaon, Dhule and Nashik, as well as Akola and parts of Aurangabad.Mumbai, Thane and Sindhudurg might see relatively smaller rises in extreme rainfall events - a 10% increase, say, compared to 30% in Nandurbar.However, that doesn't mean Nandurbar will have more flooding than Mumbai or the rest of the Konkan, note researchers.Since the Konkan has high rainfall already, a little extra rain could be the difference between saturation and flooding.In Mumbai, the flood risk may also be aggravated by a rise in sea levels, projected to be in the range of about 24cm to 66cm for this coastline by the end of the century.On the other hand, areas like Dhule and Jalgaon may not have the resources or infrastructure to cope with extreme events.Climatic projections have to be combined with local context, emphasizes Bhadwal, to understand their effects on the ground. ""These projections give us a general picture of change, but local topographical features and other factors shape the local outcomes, including the capacity of a place to cope with change,"" she said."

A licensed cigarette factory is also operational on the premises.""We would write to the district magistrate in this connection on Monday so that the entire premises on which the sugar company's bottling plant is built, including the cigarette factory, is confiscated,"" said Muzaffarpur excise superintendent Kumar Amit on Saturday, adding that the property is worth more than Rs2 crore. Amit said the liquor was hidden in the bottling plant.""The excise sleuths had sealed the bottling unit on March 31 night, but the seal was found broken and the lock was also changed when we raided the premises on May 24,"" said Amit. He also said the landowner, Om Prakash Gupta, and cigarette factory owner Vikas Sah, have been evading arrest as they have also been named in the FIR. He said a separate FIR has been lodged with Mushahari police station for breaking the seal and changing the lock.Meanwhile, the Riga Sugar Company administration has written a letter to the excise department principal secretary K K Pathak for impartial inquiry, alleging that the general manager had been framed in a false case. But assistant commissioner (excise) OP Mandal said action against Dwivedi would be taken according to the prohibition law of the state."

At present, under the revised national tuberculosis control programme (RNTCP), TB patients are asked to check their sugar levels too. Through the new framework, health officials hope to detect more TB cases.""Our estimation of people suffering from the bacterial infection is 22 lakh, but we are able to reach only 14 lakh patients. We don't know if the 'missing' population is getting the right diagnosis and treatment,"" said Dr Sunil D Khaparde, deputy director general in the ministry of health and family welfare, who also heads the central TB division. As a pilot project, the new framework was implemented in 100 districts across India.Dr Khaparde, who was in the city to deliver the 31st edition of Professor Viswanathan Medical Oration on Sunday, said the guidelines will be followed by all government facilities with the RNTCP setup.A recent study by Dr Vijay Viswanathan, chief diabetologist at M V Hospital for diabetes, and University of Massachusetts Medical School, found that 54.1% of the 209 patients they surveyed with pulmonary tuberculosis were diabetic, while 21% were pre-diabetic. ""According to data, every fourth person has latent TB, which surfaces when the immune system is weak,"" said Dr Viswanathan. Diabetes, he explained, increases the risk of progression to active TB disease in people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB. Conversely, TB has an effect on diabetes. It can not only worsen blood sugar control but also complicate clinical management of diabetes.Dr Khaparde said earlier studies had shown that treatment failure rates of tuberculosis patients were higher if they had poorly-controlled diabetes. Chennai is estimated to have a diabetes prevalence of 18.5%, and TB prevalence of 0.25 %. ""Although the evidence on the link between TB and diabetes has been around for a while now, it has been assessed and consolidated only recently. Now we have compiled enough evidence, and need to act fast and implement bidirectional screening,"" said Dr Khaparde."

The petition referred to the protest of the oil major to the education cess and secondary education cess levied on the oil cess under the Oil Industries Development Act 1974.While moving this petition, Vipul Singhvi, senior standing counsel for the Centre and central excise, customs and service tax department, objected to the argument of the company that both these taxes are similar to other cess levied in the country like sugar cess and others. ""Hence, the education cess and secondary education cess could not be levied on the oil cess,"" argued the counsel for Cairn India.Arguing further, Singvi said the oil cess was not pari materia (similar) to other cess applicable in the country and prayed for the rejection of the writ petition for refund by the energy major.""It was a provision under this act that both above mentioned cess would be levied in the form of tax on all types of duties under the central excise.

The earlier estimates put the amount needed at Rs60,000 crore, but a little bit of innovative planning has helped bring it down to Rs20,000 crore,"" said Gadkari. The Clean Ganga mission is a flagship programme of the BJP government.Gadkari was addressing the concluding function of Innovators Industries Entrepreneurs Facilitators and Academia (IIEFA) organized by RSS arm Vijnana Bharati. The aim of this three-day seminar at VNIT campus was to bring industries and research agencies together on a platform.Gadkari said the problem areas along the river's path were identified. It was found that a host of industries, like tanneries, oil refineries, sugar mills, distilleries and paper mills, were located along the river, which were causing a lot of pollution. ""We have come up with a proposal to use the polluted water in Ganga by the industries. This will not only make commercial sense but also help keep the river clean,"" he said.Gadkari said he has approached the ministry of petroleum, power and railways. The Mathura refinery needs 40 million litre pre day of water (MLD). It has agreed to draw polluted water from Ganga. In the same way, the ministry of power has also agreed to use such water for the 13 power plants located in the area. The power plants need 750 MLD of water. This will help suck out the polluted water from the river, he said.He said the ministry of railways has also been approached with a similar idea to use the polluted water for cleaning rail coaches. Sugar mills and tanneries along the river's flow have also been offered interest free loans to recycle and use the water.NMC to extract methane from sewageNitin Gadkari said a meeting was held at NMC with an expert from the US, Dr Rao, on the civic body's project to extract methane and carbon dioxide from sewage water. The expert has already done this successfully at Warna in West Maharashtra. The methane generated out of the process can be used for making bio CNG for running buses.

In an interview with The Hindu , he talks about the current water crisis and possible solutions.Your views on the States water crisis?Maharashtra has had a drought either throughout the state or in several regions since 2012, so to some extent, the current water crisis can be tied to the annual recurrence of persistent drought. Like the rest of the country, Maharashtra experiences the bulk of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, so a few failed monsoons can quickly add up. Drought is a natural occurrence, although human-induced climate change might be increasing the variability in rain, resulting in a few years of drought followed by some years of excess rain. Shortage, on the other hand, is entirely a human creation, and is a direct result of mismanagement, priorities and policies.How well has the State managed its water?Maharashtra is the countrys most industrialised state (highest gross state domestic product), has a large agricultural sector, and contains several cities including the power-hungry Mumbai metropolis. All these sectors have water needs. Given the severity of the crisis, it is clear that the state hasnt been able to manage its water. Promoting water-intensive crops like sugarcane doesnt help the state in this regard. Urbanisation of even small towns has meant that small lakes and rivulets that fed those lakes have vanished, making room for more land. Unchecked withdrawal of groundwater has left very little reserve water for use in such situations.How do you suggest the State can manage the crisis?Though virtually impossible, the state needs to rein in the sugar lobbys power and cut off subsidies for sugar production, which receives a large proportion of the irrigated water supply. Reviving small lakes and streams will ensure local water supplies are intact and groundwater remains recharged. Sustained drought not only diminishes surface water availability, but it also slowly and steadily taps out moisture from groundwater. Increasing water prices can also be an option, although the tariff hike by MIDC in 2013 was so unpopular with businesses that it had to be revoked a year later. Long-term measures that impact planning, choices in food and energy production and recognition of the severity of the issue will have more long-lasting effects than banning cricket matches and watering of golf courses and vineyards. Water policing is a very appealing option to many lawmakers and the public, but is not effective.Is desalination an option?Desalination is a very expensive method of generating clean water. One might argue that in times of shortage, the added cost might be worth the benefit of having a reliable supply. Without even including the impacts of desalination on marine life and water quality, it only seems prudent when there is a clear agreement between buyers and sellers. If the state or a local municipal agency is to foot the bill for a new desalination plant, then buyers of that water must be clearly identified and contractually obligated to purchase it at negotiated rates, regardless of the rainfall situation in that year. As examples from countries like Australia have shown, desalination plants built during periods of drought turn into white elephants when rainfall returns to normal levels."

The action was initiated following a complaint by Dubai-based company Ara International.A contract between Sunshine Exporters and the Dubai-based firm was formalized in October last year after the two trading establishments were introduced to each other through a broker dealing in the grain market. Sunshine Export was supposed to supply 5,460 metric tonnes of sugar to the foreign firm, which mostly deals in export and import of grains to international destinations like South Africa. The Dubai-based firm, owned by Kush Sharma, transferred $90,000 to Sunshine Export's account in Bank of Baroda in October last year as first instalment for the first round of supplies within a fortnight. However, the supplies never reached the company.An offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust was registered at Dhantoli police station against DTS Murthy of Sunshine Exporters after some preliminary inquiries. Murthy, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the defaulting company, is yet to be arrested.Assistant police inspector (API) Pradeep Lande said the case was taken very seriously by senior officials since the fraud involved duping an international company, which was investing in the country and bringing in foreign currency. ""A search was conducted at the premises of Sunshine Exporters in connection with the crime. Documents, company seals, records and other material were seized from the office,"" said Lande. ""We have also frozen the Bank of Baroda account of the company in which the payment was transferred,"" said Lande. The team led by Lande conducted the search and probe under DCP, EOW, Deepali Masirkar.API Lande said more names may come to fore as accused in the case as details regarding the deal and other issues are traced."

The doctor can easily look at the ECG on his/her phone or computer and connect with the patient instantly.""""The technology provides an option to have a back-up doctor in case the primary doctor isn't available. This novel hand-held device can be used on an Android smartphone and weighs only 70gm. Secured cloud-based medical record storage with 99.99% server uptime is guaranteed,"" added Dr Karthik.""Heart conditions build up over a period of time. By using this device, a normal person can nip any such condition in the bud. The device was introduced in India last year and is useful for the rural population, and at health camps/community outreach programmes,"" said Chris Thomas, founder of wellatheart.com, a one-stop cardio portal to help patients with heart disputes.Syncope (temporary loss of consciousness caused by a fall in blood pressure) is quite common among paediatric patients aged 10 to 18 years. The condition can be detected using the device. It's a useful tool to mark high/low or abnormal heart rate which might be precipitating the syncopal attack. It can also be used as an ECG monitor for adults and children in remote areas for quick and trouble-free consultancy with a doctorDr Shreesha Maiya | consultant paediatric interventional cardiologist, Narayana Institute of Cardiac Science"

This will ensure the factory does not discharge untreated water."

The government should give priority to groundwater recharging and construction and preservation of tanks, lakes and ponds to conserve water.Lack of water also meant there was shortage of power; leading to farmers not being able to use their irrigation pumpsets. Unlike the previous BJP government, the State government had failed to purchase power from other States to make good the power shortfall.Inspite of the farmers facing crop losses due to drought, they had not been given any compensation by the State government. They also could not take full benefit of the Fasal Bima Yojana of the Union government because of its lackadaisical implementation by the State government.Though the coconut and arecanut growers were facing a lot of problems, the State governments response to it had left a lot to be desired, he said. Mr. Gowda said the State government had not shown any interest in reviving the Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory in Udupi district, which had been shut down 12 years ago. The implementation of the Varahi Irrigation project was progressing at a snails pace."

The first conference to identify and address various issues of air pollution was held in the city on Saturday at Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (Yashada).""Ten cities in Maharashtra will have an action plan for improving the air quality. In the first phase, we have taken Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur. We will be holding conferences in Mumbai and Nagpur also,"" said P Anbalagan, member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.""Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) will together design the action plan. The terms of reference will be finalized by the next week and by mid-March, we expect the action plan,"" said Anbalagan.The plan will consist of short- and long-term goals. ""The short-term goals will be for three months. After this, we will do an impact assessment. The long-term goals will actually impact the pollution in these cities. We will be moving towards strict implementation with stringent punishment for defaulters,"" said Anbalagan.Divisional commissioner S Chockalingam, who was present at the conference, suggested various measures like introducing environment cess and improving public transport by opening it up to the private sector. ""We have been taking up the issues of pollution and traffic on priority and have been holding monthly meetings with chiefs of all major stakeholders. Asphalt coating of side margins of roads can bring down dust, but it will pose a challenge to water percolation. The burning of sugar stalks also lets out particle matter. Improvement in public transport is very essential and there should be competition between public and private buses to ensure best service.""He wondered why can't environment tax be levied on all vehicles sold. ""The money collected can be used to financing metro or public transport. Colleges should close their gates to polluting vehicles and students should be encouraged to use either public transport or electric vehicles. There is a need to prepare an action plan and stick to its implementation,"" he added.Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist, Neeri, spoke about the odd-even formula applied in New Delhi. ""In Delhi, it is asked if there was any decrease in pollution. According to our studies, there was a 30% decrease in the petrol and diesel consumption. It means much less fuel was burnt, which automatically means less emission. Even the toxic pollutants like sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) reduced by 18%. As far as particulate matter is concerned, it increases or decreases according to the wind and other factors,"" he said, adding that the authorities had already done a lot of monitoring and would have to use this data to actually do something.Rajeev Jadhav, the commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, recommended improving low cost public transport to reduce vehicular emission."

Farmers and water users' associations formed by irrigators are the water consumers for irrigation purposes and industries and domestic consumers are charged for water consumtion for non-irrigation purposes.Water expert Pradeep Purandare said technical issues such as absence of adequate staff with the water resources department, unavailability of proper records and lack of enabling rules have affected the recovery of dues towards water charges.""The Maharashtra Irrigation Act, 1976 does not have the necessary implementation rules almost four decades after its enactment. The records related to consumption of water are not properly maintained and updated in some cases,"" he said.The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) is the competent authority to decide water charges for irrigation and non-irrigation use. ""Water tariff collected from the users goes to the general treasury, while funds for operation and management of irrigation schemes come from the state budget. There is no structural link, whatsoever, between these two,"" claimed Purandare, adding that a section of farmers refuse to pay water tariff.Senior government officials said the recovery of dues towards water charges is a complex issue. C A Birajadar, executive director of the Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation, said several pending disputes related to use of water in irrigation and non-irrigation category have caused an increase in the recovery amount over the years.""In the past, farmers had to pay 50% charges for using water from their wells. The practice was ended some years back and dues to be charged towards the past use are yet to be recovered. In irrigation sector, there are cases of penalties to be recovered from farmers and water users association for not ensuring proper storages during the discharge,"" he said.Many disputes involving industries regarding quantity of water released has also added considerably to the mounting dues. ""In non-irrigation category, sugar factories are a major consumer of water. As per rules, these mills have to send prior requisition for water and pay for minimum 90% of reserved amount. Sugar factories refuse to pay if the water required is less than the reserved amount,"" Birajadar said.Percentage of recovery of water dues from farmers cultivating rain-fed agricultural land is very less. In general, farmers need to pay for water usage after harvesting particular crop. They use water in advance, but later dilly-dally on payment, Birajdar said.Shrikant Umrikar, spokesperson of farmers group Shetkari Sanghatana, said the entire system has loopholes and gaps and therefore farmers cannot be blamed in isolation.""The WRD has to ensure transparency and accountability in its functioning regarding water supply to irrigation and non-irrigation sectors. If it happens, all stakeholders, including farmers will have a win-win situation,"" he said.Ashish Garde, president, Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture, said operational business are generally not the defaulters when it comes to paying water bills. The MIDC severs water supply if the bills are not paid within stipulated time and therefore running business cannot afford to be defaulter. It may be that the defunct units or sick units have failed to pay water bills, he said.Garde added that disputes related to quantity of used water do not drag for long and are usually settled within a couple of months.Usually, civic bodies fail to recover the water charges in time from the citizens. This also adds to the water charges due with the water resources department."

This has been done to offset the rising cost of cane and facilitate timely payment of cane price dues of farmers.Due to drought situation, there has been significant decline in sugarcane/sugar production in the country by about 1.8 million MT (mMT) and 0.8 mMT respectively, according to a government statement. Drought-affected States requested to reduce the target of sugar export and ethanol supply due to non-availability of sufficient sugarcane and molasses.Initially, the export quota target was at 15.70 kg of sugar for each tonne of estimated cane crushing."

The students of the Department of Studies in Food Science and Nutrition, Mysore University, recently organised a food safety and consumer awareness programme where they displayed a can of soft drink and hung a plastic pouch containing the amount of sugar in it.The students also told the visitors about the ill effects of consuming products with high glycemic index (which indicates the effect on blood glucose). While drinking, most people dont realise that so much of sugar is getting into their system. We just wanted to try and create awareness about this, said Prof. Asna Urooj, chairperson of the department.The visitors were also made aware of the fact that processed fruit drinks largely contain sugar water instead of actual fruit pulp. Homemade fruit juices are better as one can control the amount of sugar, she said.According to a release, the students also spread awareness on the need to select food based on nutritive attributes such as glycemic index, salts, fats and oils. Various theme-based topics, such as hidden facts about chocolates, plastic packaging and food handling, were displayed in posters at the programme.The programme was organised in association with Giggles of Livez, a nutrition consultancy firm.

Arthanari, National General Secretary of Indian Youth Congress and close lieutenant of Rahul Gandhi, in the fray.Mr. Arthanari is pitted against R.M. Sinnathambi of AIADMK, G. Amasaveni (PMK) and K.P. Adityan (VCK), all the three new faces to poll scenario. This is the second consecutive time Mr. Arthanari is fighting the elections here. He was the Congress candidate in the DMK-Congress alliance in the 2011 elections too, but suffered defeat at the hands of S. Madheswaran of AIADMK by a margin of over 29,000 votes.Attur constituency is spread over in two municipalities of Attur and Narasingapuram and parts of Attur and Pethanayakkanpalayam taluks. Vanniyars are dominant community, followed by Adidravidars, Udaiyars, Nayakkars, Kongu Vellalar, and Naidu community people.Apart from farming, Attur town and surrounding areas account for a large number of rig units. A large number of sago factories are also in operation in Attur taluk.Attur being a major town and surrounded by many commercial units, the people of Attur have been pleading for bifurcating Salem district and creation of new revenue district with Attur as headquarters.A struggle committee formed for this purpose has already launched various initiatives to attract the attention of the government to their demand.River Vasishtanadhi, named after Vasishta Munivar, flows across this constituency. The river is polluted because of mixing of effluents of innumerable sago units and sewage at various points. All sections of the society have been demanding the government to renovate and desilt this river.The government a couple of decades ago proposed a Kallaru Reservoir Scheme for the benefit of farming community. This issue was raised by the local people on various occasions, but the project remains only on paper. Another major issue raised by the local people is the absence of adequate train services.The local people complain that the municipalities of Edappadi and Attur (reserved) celebrated their golden jubilees last year. While the Chief Minister Jayalalithaa sanctioned Rs. 25 crore as special fund for development works for Edappadi Municipality, such a gesture was not extended to Attur Municipality. This was despite the ruling party men and various associations making repeated pleas.Mr. Arthanari says that the ruling party did not do anything for solving the long time demands of setting up sugar factory, government arts college, industries etc. No development works were implemented in the constituency in the last five years.The AIADMK cadre claim that seven new bridges were constructed in the last five years. Four PHCs were upgraded and converted into 30-bed hospitals at an outlay of Rs. 4 crore. The government constructed overhead water tanks spending Rs. 14 crore in Narasingapuram municipal limits, and a new building for maternity ward at the Attur GH.The PMK due to the presence of a large number of Vanniyar community people, too, is making a brave effort to reach the voters. The party founder Dr. S. Ramadoss addressed a few meetings in the constituency."

Most sugar mills have not even paid sugarcane arrears to farmers from last year. This year, due to a nexus between the state government and mills, the SAP was set at Rs 280. The cost of inputs for a farmer, however, comes to around Rs 350 per quintal. For the last couple of years, farmers have been forced to sell sugarcane at this rate,"" said Agarwal in a statement.He added saying, ""In Meerut district alone, cane farmers are yet to receive their dues of around Rs 200 crore. Several farmers have killed themselves. The government of Uttar Pradesh, which is anti-farmer, remained unaffected. 75% of the state's population is dependent on agriculture, particularly on the cultivation of sugarcane. Their livelihoods depend on it. However, the state government does not want farmers to be happy. We want that the cane price be changed to Rs 350 per quintal.
