The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in its report, pointed out serious flaws in the functioning of the government leading to the violation of excise policy.Rajasthan observed five dry days in which the sale of liquor are prohibited. However, government-owned company Rajasthan State Ganganagar Sugar Mills Limited sold liquor worth Rs 3.28 crore on these specific days.According to the report, suitable provisions in the software were not incorporated to prohibit the sale of country-made liquor even though prohibited four days have fixed dates, except Mahavir Jayanti.The government, however, claimed that the sale was made before the dry days but the entries in the system appeared on those days because of power failure or poor internet connectivity.Besides, the company flouted the restrictions imposed by the Election Commission and allowed the sale during election/counting of votes in assembly polls, Lok Sabha elections and municipal elections during years 2013-15. The company sold liquor worth Rs 4.13 crore to the retailers on these dates. This all happened despite installing CCTV cameras as per EC guidelines to monitor to and fro transportation of liquor at the depots.The CAG, in its report, said that the response received from the state government in its defence was not convincing. It noted that the company in March 2013 had directed all its depot in-charges to sell liquor by generating the invoice online and hence the liquor could not be sold without generating bill."

He said the PM's call for ministers to be more active on social media is transforming their working styles. Excerpts of his interview withThis is a pro-poor, pro-SCST, pro-farmer and pro-labourer government. The focus has been on giving power to the poor. Prime Minister himself is from a poor family and he has seen poverty from close quarters. All schemes including Jan Dhan Yojna, PM Bima Yojna, and Ujjwala (free gas cylinder for poor) are for the marginalised people. We are providing Rs 1.30 lakh crore subsidy for food grains. State governments hardly share any cost towards this. We have not increased prices in the past two years.Honestly speaking, I don't find any sector that has remained untouched by this government in past two years. Everyone is putting in their best effort. When PM works for 20 hours, all MPs and ministers get motivation to work more.I have never felt that I represent a smaller party. PM has given more respect to the allies. All the ministers from ally parties are going to differ ent parts for publicity of government achievements. PM takes meeting of NDA and not just of BJP MPs.What else can they do? It's for people to judge. The recent poll results in Assam was historic. It's the gateway to the North-East. Formation of NDA government in Jammu and Kashmir is not a small thing despite the state having a majority from minority community . The PM has never digressed from his agenda of promoting youth, development and power to the poor.We can only make policies and have necessary steps taken. We brought a new BIS Act for better enforcement of product standards and the consumer protection bill will be passed with stronger provisions to safeguard consumer rights, quick processing of cases and deterrent provision for misleading advertisements. We are planning a directorate for legal metrology, which deals with issues of weight and measures. I have suggested that we must have at least one certified weighing machine in every panchayat bhawan where people can get the weight of commodities verified.Food department has pursued several reforms, which will have huge impact in the next one-two years. But rising prices of pulses has remained a concern.We have achieved 100% digitisation of ration cards, Aadhaar seeding in ration cards is 53%. We are transferring cash to the accounts of over two lakh beneficiary families under food security scheme in three UTs. Electronic point of sale is progressing fast to eliminate leakage of subsidised food grain.Problems relating to pulses is because of the short supply . We had procured 50,000 tonnes during Rabi season and have already procured another 40,000 tonnes during the current Kharif season. We are importing nearly 30,000 tonnes. States have been asked to take pulses from us and sell them at prices fixed by us.When we came to power the cane arrears was Rs 14,000 crore. Because of our initiatives, the arrears of 2014-15 sugar season has reduced to about Rs 780 crore. Out of this UP accounts for just Rs 191 crore. For the current sugar season, the arrears are only about Rs 9,361 crore compared to arrears of Rs 22,000 crore last year. Out of this UP accounts for Rs 2,855 crore.It's helped a lot. You keep track of everything happening across ministries and get almost real-time update of PM's activities and his views. What PM says is actually the government's thought and this helps. People are using social media extensively and we all need to catch up."
58f551d07be9e01a17c9711b,Maharashtra sugar factories owe farmers Rs 918cr over 2 yrs,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Maharashtra-sugar-factories-owe-farmers-Rs-918cr-over-2-yrs/articleshow/52962819.cms,2016-06-29,"Maharashtra's powerful sugar lobby owes cane farmers as much as Rs 918 crore over the last two years, according to the latest data from the sugar commissioner's office. The figure is on a par with almost 60% of the state's public health outlay for this year.Among those who owe money are both private mills and cooperative sugar factories controlled by the state's sugar baron politicians, including former ministers and even a former chief minister.Yet Maharashtra has among the least arrears compared to other sugar-producing states like Uttar Pradesh, where cane dues are becoming an election issue. In fact, sugar factories in Maharashtra paid almost 96% of their dues by June 15 when the data was compiled.Among the cooperative mills that owe cane farmers money is the Warna mill controlled by former minister Vinay Kore from the Jan Surajya Party which owes almost Rs 32 crores. Also the Vasantdada sugar mill in Sangli controlled by Vishal Patil, brother of former union minister of state Pratik Patil from the Congress owes almost Rs 27 crores. And several factories under the Bhaurao Chavan umbrella controlled by former chief minister Ashok Chavan owe Rs 28 crores.Also on the arrears list is the Shankar factory in Solapur which owes Rs 27 crores to farmers. It is controlled by Dhavalsinh Mohite Patil, nephew of former deputy chief minister Vijaysinh Mohite Patil. The Aadinath mill in Solapur controlled by former NCP MLA Shyamaltai Bagal owes Rs 18.60 crores while the Chopada factory in Jalgaon controlled by the NCP's Nita Sambhaji Patil owes Rs 13.63 crores.Among the private sugar mills which owe money are the Saikripa factories in Ahmednagar which owe Rs 31 crores, Aryan Sugar and Vijay Sugar in Solapur which owe over Rs 20 crores each as well as Yashwant Sugar in Sangli which owes Rs 13.68 crores. Also, Shivratna mill in Solapur which owes over Rs 13 crores and Jakaraya Sugars in Solapur which owes Rs 10 crores.The main problem factories faced was the record-breaking sugar production last year and a steep drop in both international and domestic prices. Factories found it difficult to pay the cane price set by the Union government that was higher than the price at which sugar was selling. This year, sugar prices have improved.""Maharashtra has the least arrears among the sugar-producing states. Last year there was a problem because of the glut in production and crash in sugar prices. This year, conditions have improved,"" said state sugar commissioner Vipul Sharma. Last year, the price of sugar had dropped to Rs 1,800 per quintal while cane prices were set at over Rs 2,500. This year, the price of sugar is much higher at over Rs 3,000 a quintal.Most factories say their arrears will be cleared by Diwali, which has traditionally been the last instalment for payments. ""The bulk of our arrears are old dues. In fact, we have paid even more by now but the information has to be updated,"" said Vishal Patil from the Vasantdada sugar factory in Sangli. The Chopada sugar factory in Jalgaon, whose licence has been suspended, says the previous management and lack of loans from banks is responsible for their arrears.""The arrears cannot be looked at as an absolute sum. The fact is that in most cases, including my factories, more than 90% of the dues have been paid. That's what the government wanted and we have met the demand,"" said former CM Ashok Chavan. He said the government needs to change its method of fixing cane price. ""They fix the cane price on last year's sugar prices. If sugar prices crash, how can we pay the cane price?"" he asked.Sugar factories in the state are counting on a Rs 45 per ton subsidy announced by the Centre to finally clear dues. ""Sugar prices rose in February. By then 40% of the sugar stock had been sold at a lower price. So factories could not capitalize on the price rise,"" pointed out Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. ""Only 20 mills have paid less than 90% of their dues,"" he pointed out.However, farm activist Raju Shetti from the Swabhimani Paksh, an ally of the BJP-Shiv Sena government, said he will continue to agitate over arrears. ""In some cases, factories do not pay the cane prices because of debts and mismanagement. The position in Maharashtra has improved but we have to keep the pressure on,"" he said."
58f551f77be9e01a17c9714c,Who says marriage is only for the young...,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/preeti-bis/articleshow/52931249.cms,2016-06-27,"HYDERABAD: Age is just a number. At least that is the case with hundreds of senior citizens in the city who are opting to find love at the age of 60 and above. The words marriage and live-in relationships are no more restricted to the young generation, with NGOs and marriage bureaus in the city pointing out how many senior citizens are now coming forward to find company in old age.""In 2010, we got hardly 70 people in a matrimonial meet for senior citizens. But today, nearly six to seven such events are organised every year wherein over 3,000 people come forward to find companions,"" said a proud N M Rajeshwari, founder of Thodu Needa, a city-based NGO that works to eradicate loneliness among elderly people by finding them companions.For Sunita Murthy, 66, marrying an 80-year-old man gave a fresh outlook to her life. Breaking the social stigma behind marrying in old age, she got herself registered with Thodu Needa. ""After my husband expired, I felt very lonely. I used to stay with my daughter, who was later diagnosed with cancer. Soon I realised that I have to take the plunge and look for a partner as staying alone was not an option,"" said Murthy, who married a yoga instructor in 2014.For Parimi Rajagopal, 62, it was his children who encouraged him to remarry after his wife died. Having lived his life independently until retirement, he did not want to stay with his children - two sons in the USA and a daughter in Bengaluru. ""Since I had medical issues such as high blood pressure, sugar and cholesterol, my children insisted that I remarry. After deliberations, I considered the option and married a woman who was an acquaintance,"" said Rajagopal.Social organisations have also observed that among the elderly, there are many couples who don't want to marry but want to be in a live-in relationship just to share their happiness and sorrows. ""Surprisingly, during our matrimonial meets, we got so many women who wanted to be in a live-in relationship with a man and avoid any legal complications. People do not want to get into the mental agony of divorce in old age and prefer to have companions as it is not the physical intimacy but the emotional support that is more important,"" said Rajeshwari.Psychologists too have observed that although a majority of senior citizens are financially self-sufficient, it is loneliness that encourages them to break the barrier and remarry. ""A majority of the cases that I have seen are from nuclear families who spend more hours at work. Senior citizens often feel neglected and also develop psychological loneliness. In such cases, many explore the option of getting into a live-in relationship,"" observed Radhika Nallan Acharya, rehabilitation psychologist at Deccan Hospital in Somajiguda."

A series of exhibitions and events on the community's culture and tradition are currently being held across the city on the occasion of Navroz and will continue till May 29. Organised by the ministries of minority affairs and culture, the initiative comes on the heels of the Jiyo Parsi program, which was launched in 2013 by the government to address the problem of the community's dwindling population.""Homai Vyarawalla (India's first woman photojournalist) used to be asked, yeh Parsi kya cheez hai? Now, so many years later we're trying to explain kya cheez hai"", said Shernaz Cama, academic, cultural conservationist and one of the moving spirits behind the initiative.The most ambitious of these exhibitions-The Everlasting Flame: Zoroastrianism in History and Imagination-is being held at the National Museum in collaboration with SOAS, the British Library and the National Museum of Iran.The exhibition provides a chronological account of the birth of Zoroastrianism, the contact between Jewish and Iranian communities, how it influenced Judaism and later Christianity and Islam. There are also sections on the Silk Road trade and the splendours of imperial Iran.Prayer fragments in the Avestan script, excerpts from religious texts, an enamelled reliquary casket from Limoges, a delicate griffin bird carved in bone, a faded mural of warrior Rustam spearing an enemy, among others are on display.A more accessible show, Threads of Continuity, on the living culture of the Parsis has been organised by the Parzor Foundation and will feature performances and events till May.""The kusti (the 72-thread sacred girdle) is an unbroken tradition from the Bronze Age till now. It is woven on the same loom then and now, in Iran, India and elsewhere,"" said Cama. ""That's the kind of continuity we wanted to bring alive.""Although the anecdote about Parsis promising to blend into India like sugar in milk is apocryphal, this show details that happy accommodation in Gujarat, Mumbai, and the Deccan. There are glimpses of the diaspora and influential Parsis from the Tatas to Homi Bhabha to Sam Manekshaw, as well as imposing portraits, knick-knacks like candelabras and tinkling music boxes.""For 18 years, we have documented the philosophy and faith, the multicultural amalgam that Parsis are in India,"" said Cama.Meanwhile, the National Gallery of Modern Art is hosting a twin show titled Painted Encounters-Parsi Traders and the Community, and No Parsi is an Island, curated by Nancy Adajania and Ranjit Hoskote. These shows trace the works of 14 Parsi artists, who worked in film, theatre, poetry, classical dance and crafts, over the past 150 years.""We wanted to breach the notions of canon, temporality, style and period. We were more interested in the 'worlding' of Parsis,"" said Hoskote.From 19th century oil paintings, dance sketches and photographs by Shiavax Chavda, Piloo Pochkhanawala's sculptures and Gieve Patel's canvases, the exhibitions show how Parsis shaped themselves to colonial modernity, nationalism, Indian modernism and global culture."

I will personally support all projects to get clearances from my ministry.""The attendance at the convention was also seen as an attempt to spread Bharatiya Janata Party's base into Kagal, which has been consecutively won by Nationalist Congress Party leader Hasan Mushrif but at reducing margins. Mushrif won the 2014 assembly election from Kagal by a margin of just 5,000 votes.Along with Khadse, district guardian minister Chandrakant Patil, BJP chief spokesperson Madhav Bhandari, Shiv Sena candidate from 2014 assembly election Sanjay Ghatge, BJP MLA Suresh Halwankar, Amal Mahadik, Shiv Sena MLA Prakash Abitkar and chairman of Chhatrapati Shahu Kagal cooperative sugar mill Samarjitsinh Ghatge were present.Kolhapur district is part of Krishna river basin before the river enters Karnataka. The Krishna water tribunal has given its verdict for storing water, of which 100 TMC is stored in the district with the help of dams and weirs. The tribunal has given permission for 110 TMC; hence, the local BJP unit organised a convention to push for remaining works of some dams.The works include completion of construction works of dams in Chikotra basin, canals and check dams for arresting more water. This would enable farmers from Kagal, Bhudargad, Chandgad, Ajara and Gadhinglaj to get more water and go for multiple crops.Halwankar has already stated that projects worth Rs 5,000 crore are still pending in Kolhapur district.If the Centre and the state government contribute towards the projects, there will be huge benefits for the farmers as well as for other industries."

But a few loopholes in Koyate's story revealed that he had tried to eliminate his wife.The police on Thursday arrested Koyate and his two accomplices under the charges of murder attempt.Koyate's wife Bhagyashri, who had sustained severe injuries in the attack has now recovered, said Arun Waykar, senior inspector of the Hinjewadi police station.On the evening of April 27, the Hinjewadi police had rushed to Nere village on Kasarsai sugar factory road when they received a call of assault and robbery attempt.Bhagyashri had sustained stab wounds on her cheek, throat and chest. She was rushed to a private hospital immediately. Koyate, who lodged the police complaint, had told police that the family was heading to a temple in Mulshi in their car. After that, Koyate said that they were going to visit a relative.C M Suryavanshi, assistant inspector of the Hinjewadi police station, said that Koyate told police that when they reached Nere village, an unidentified man told him to stop the car and demanded Koyate's licence.

""Koyate had said in his complaint that one man had told him to stop the car and so he stopped. It was hard to believe why a car driver would stop for an unknown person on the road,"" he said.Moreover, Koyate had told police that the incident happened when they were heading towards the temple. ""We found that the incident happened after the car had crossed the temple. We also wanted to know why Koyate took a road where there was hardly any traffic,"" Suryavanshi said.The police also contacted Koyate's relative who the family was supposed to visit. after offering prayers.

According to rough estimates, a sugarcane cultivator would get Rs 85 per tonne extra than its earlier price of Rs 1,875.As a routine practice, the MSC bank decides valuation of sugar from time to time, which is used as bar for trading. Based on the valuation, the factories calculate their income and release sugar stock in the market.The 2015-16 sugarcane crushing season got over in April. The MSC bank then decided to undertake valuation of sugar stock in the state.A meeting was held in the second week of June where the valuation decision was taken. It was finalised in the last week and the bank's managing director Pramod Karnad made it public thereafter.He said the current trend is to purchase sugar as per requirement.

It's an argument that could work for a separate Marathwada state - ""Look, even powerful leaders could get nothing for their own constituencies, because of the domination of leaders from western Maharashtra."" But it's mostly made by those against a separate state, as a comment on the spinelessness of the region's leadership, a factor seen to be responsible for its backwardness.Marathwada has had at least six prominent leaders: S B Chavan, Shivajirao Nilangekar Patil, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ashok Chavan as CMs; a deputy CM - Gopinath Munde, and a union home minister in Shivraj Patil. If they could do nothing to get their share of the state's resources, would the powerful western Maharashtra leaders let a small state dependent on their resources survive?Can the idea of a separate state be thrown like a pebble in a lake, hoping that ripples would be created?That's exactly what's happened over the fortnight since former state advocate general Shrihari Aney approved of the idea of a separate Marathwada at a function in Jalna. Aney had to resign given the ferocious reactions from all parties, but the ripples created by his statement are still disturbing the seemingly calm waters of Marathwada.They haven't become waves though, and may not for a long time.Aney's statement is being discussed only in intellectual and political circles. Among the people, the idea of a separate state is not just incomprehensible, it's condemnable. ""Maharashtra must be one, it can't be broken into parts,"" said a worker in Aurangabad.""Remember the story we learnt in school - a twig can be easily broken, but a bundle can't? United we stand, divided we fall,"" said Babbanbhai Kakde, a farmer on the outskirts of Aurangabad.""Would we be able to go for jobs to Mumbai?'' asks Digambar Avti, a farmer, who points to the migration of jobless landless labour. ""Or would Raj Thackeray ask for domicile certificates?""Has the BJP underestimated the feeling ordinary people in Marathwada have for their state? For there's no question that Aney's statement had the backing of the BJP. For one, Aney is known to be chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' close associate. Then, as soon as Aney had made this statement, in Latur, BJP MP Sunil Gaekwad's followers led by Shivaji Narhare went all the way to Delhi to convince Narendra Modi about it.Significantly, Aney also has the support of the BJP's mentor. A day after his statement, senior RSS ideologue M G Vaidya stated that the RSS had always conceived of Maharashtra as four states, and had divided its units in Maharashtra accordingly.The RSS has no base in Marathwada; and though the BJP won 15 seats here in the Assembly polls, it's the Shiv Sena, which won 11, that has popular support. Chandrakant Khaire, fourth-time MP from Aurangabad, dared Aney to enter Marathwada. ""Our leader Balasaheb gave us the slogan 'Jai Maharashtra','' he told Mirror. ""In Parliament too, everyone greets me with those two words. This is Chhatrapati Shivaji's Maharashtra. I want to ask the RSS: you talk of Akhand Bharat, but want to divide Maharashtra?""The Congress was practically wiped out in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, but both the seats it managed to retain were from Marathwada. ""We will never allow this,"" said former CM Ashok Chavan, Nanded MP, whose father S B Chavan is universally respected as having been the only leader to have done something for the region. ""Our struggle was never for a separate state; it was always to join Maharashtra.""The ""struggle"" that everyone talks about refers to the Hyderabad Mukti Sangram, the movement against the rule of the Nizam, a struggle that's unique to this part of Maharashtra. Marathwada was part of the Nizam's domain, and when he resisted joining India after Independence, the majority of his subjects revolted. It wasn't just his feudal, autocratic rule that people were fed up of. A major reason for anger, says Prof Jaidev Dole, columnist and professor of media studies, was the ban on Marathi.The Nizam let loose the armed communal force called the Razakars on those opposing him. Khaire is 63, and he remembers his mother telling him how the Razakars burnt down houses in her village. Such stories are the stuff of legend in Marathwada, the way stories about going to jail during the Quit India movement are the stuff of legend in the rest of India.And when liberation came in 1948, after the Indian Army defeated the Razakars, the freedom to speak and write in their mother tongue was one of its most cherished fruits for the people of the region.It was but natural then for the majority Marathi-speaking people in Marathwada to join the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, and become part of the new Maharashtra state in 1960. The Vidarbha region joined Maharashtra with some conditions. But Marathwada put no conditions. Its leaders, the tallest of whom was the Gandhian Govindbhai Shroff, felt they were joining their own people, recalled Suryaprakash Dhoot, general secretary of the Latur unit of the Marathwada Janata Vikas Parishad, founded by Shroff. ""We were like a bride who returns to her parents' home, full of affection and secure she'd be welcomed,"" is how Prof Sharad Adwant, general secretary of the Parishad puts it.Given this very recent history, what was the BJP thinking by floating the idea of a separate Marathwada for which, Aney suggested, the people ought to struggle? It's likely the BJP had forgotten all about the region's own freedom struggle, because the RSS had played no part in it.Different reasons are being assigned to Aney's remarks. Aney himself, like his father and grandfather, is known to be a supporter of a separate Vidarbha. His remark is seen as a bid to provide a stronger base for the creation of a separate Vidarbha. ""When two regions are seeking to break away, it's always easier to allow one to do so,"" says CPI district secretary Ram Baheti. ""It's easier to get your demand by tagging someone else with you; it's a classic bargaining tactic.""A separate Vidarbha was part of the BJP's election manifesto, and given the way the BJP has taken away to Nagpur key institutions allotted to Aurangabad, most people in Marathwada see a separate Vidarbha with a fully equipped capital  Nagpur  being created just before the next Assembly elections.Vidarbha's CM would of course be Devendra Fadnavis. What about the BJP's key ally's opposition to the idea? ""The BJP knows the Shiv Sena is dead set against any division of Maharashtra. Yet, the fact that it let Aney float the idea shows that it wants to cut Shiv Sena to size,"" says Subhash Lomte of the Maharashtra Labour Union. Aam Aadmi Party's Aurangabad candidate, Lomte is now with Yogendra Yadav's Swaraj Abhiyan.With other parties ambivalent about a separate Vidarbha, the Sena will end up as the only party opposing it, and will be routed from there during the next assembly election, says Lomte. ""The BJP has killed many birds with one stone.""While Ashok Chavan ascribed the statement to a ""realization by the BJP that it can't handle Maharashtra, and its eagerness to dominate one section of it, ie Vidarbha"", Khaire foresaw this as a precursor to the creation of a separate Mumbai.There is yet another possible reason for Aney's statement. Right now, the region's drought-hit are clamouring for ""pani, kaam, pagaar (salaries) aur ration"", four things mentioned as a priority by villagers in Turkabad near Aurangabad. In Ambejogai, Manav Lok, an NGO working in the field of watershed development, has also helped villagers organise themselves around MNREGA. And across the region, the press is exposing the lapses of the government in handling the drought.What better way to divert the attention of the angry masses than by letting forth a red herring of a separate state, asks Baheti. While the masses have certainly not been diverted, the intelligentsia are discussing the idea seriously. Ironically, the drought has given the discussion a sharper edge. Both those in favour of and against the idea use the same arguments  the discrimination faced by the region ever since it joined Maharashtra.Prof Sharad Adwant lists the areas of discrimination: Denial of its share of water from the state's dams, specially the Jayakwadi Dam built by S B Chavan specifically for dry Marathwada, by the building of smaller dams further upstream by the leaders of Western Maharashtra; denial of a second railway line  the existing one was built by the Nizam  and not even accepting the simple demand of making Aurangabad part of the Central instead of the South Central Railway; the lackadaisical functioning of the Statutory Development Boards  only the Marathwada Board has no head; the refusal to hand over the huge backlog of funds for the region's development, the diversion of funds meant for Marathwada to other regions; the stoppage since CM Prithviraj Chavan's tenure of the practice of having an annual meeting of the cabinet in Aurangabad; the diversion of major institutions from Aurangabad to Nagpur and Chandrapurin the last two years.To get their rights, Marathwada's citizens, including the Parishad, have had to go to court, with their own government opposing them. The well-known economist H M Desarda has just filed a PIL on the state government's insufficient and unscientific measures to tackle the drought, specially its much-touted Jalyukt Shivar. Water expert Pradeep Purandare's PIL on proper implementation of Maharashtra's Water Resources Act resulted in the court ordering an inquiry into all irrigation projects approved between 2007 and 2013.""The demand for a separate state is the people's cry of frustration,"" says Adwant, who says the Parishad is committed to the vision of its founder, Govindbhai Shroff - a developed Marathwada within Maharashtra. For Marathwada's development, Shroff and leaders such as Shantaram Pandere, who has worked among agricultural labour for years, waged prolonged agitations.""Like others go for an annual pilgrimage, we would go to jail,"" recalls Pandere. ""Not too many political parties joined us.""But in an embarrassment for the Parishad, its president, advocate Pradeep Deshmukh, wants a separate state, free from domination by western Maharashtra.Where are the resources, asks former Statutory Board member Vijay Diwan. Be it agriculture, industry or human development, Marathwada lags way behind even Vidarbha. ""Curtail farming, make the new state an IT hub,"" replies Deshmukh.But where's the popular demand for a separate state? Today, it's restricted to a few rootless individuals. Can they build a mass movement that would include Dalits, 14 per cent of the region's population, and Muslims, constituting 25 per cent?While some Dalit intellectuals such as Prof Bhimrao Bhosale of Dr Ambedkar University, a BJP member, cite Dr Ambedkar's advocacy of small states and a separate 'central Maharashtra', the mass of Dalits here continue to be at the receiving end of Maratha violence, just as they were during the 16-year-long Namantar agitation to rename Marathwada University after Dr Ambedkar. Like elsewhere in Maharashtra, Marathas dominate Marathwada.As for Muslims, they are indifferent. The only MLA from the MIM, Imtiyaz Jaleel describes a separate Marathwada as an ""unhealthy baby that won't solve the people's problems."" Hamid Khan of the Movement for Peace and Justice felt a small state could open the doors to corporate takeover of public resources.Muslims here are still smarting from the numerous arrests of their youngsters on terror charges. The latest humiliation was a Muslim policeman being forced to say 'Jai Shivaji' in Latur. Whether under the Congress or the BJP, Muslims know they won't get equal treatment.Marathwada's leaders have changed the region's traditional cultivation patterns and set up sugar factories and distilleries that consume most of its scarce water. Vilasrao Deshmukh's family owns five sugar factories just outside parched Latur; the Mundes own three, as well as a distillery that has received notice for polluting the villages around it. Twenty new sugar factories came up in 2012-13, a drought year, and in 2014-15, another drought year, the region saw record production of sugar from its 70 factories.Theoretically, a smaller state could see better representation of its minorities and better management of its resources. But this potential of a smaller state would only be fulfilled by a mass movement with democratically elected leaders. ""Today's politicians and bureaucrats are out of touch with the bottom half of the population,"" points out Desarda. ""A new state under their leadership would make no difference."""

Even before the onset of monsoon (June), farmers have to prepare the fields for sowing and utilize whatever means they have, apart from borrowing money to arrange for seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and wages of the supporting labourers.""""Once that is taken care of, almost all family members get engaged in the cultivation activities. They toil in the fields for days together but do not get any 'wages' till October. This period, between June to October, is the most crucial for the farmer families as their income remains zero whereas the expenditure keeps scaling up. This puts extreme financial stress on the farmers,"" Bonde said, adding to help farmers overcome these 'difficult' five months, the government should pay one-time wages at the rate of Rs 2,000 per acre, maximum up to 2.5 acres, to each farmer family in June itself.""Farmer and his family members work in the farm daily but at the end of the day, do not get anything in return like daily wagers. They have to wait till the harvest season and in this situation, even the amount of Rs 5,000 from the government would certainly make a lot of difference to them,"" Bonde said adding, ""This is to respect the 'shram' of the farmer who produces food for the country.""Bonde also suggested criteria for inclusion of farmers in the 'Krushi Shram Sanman Yojana'. He said farmers from suicide-affected and drought-affected regions should be included in the scheme even if their land holding is more than two acres. He further suggested inclusion of irrigated and non-irrigated land holding farmers along with horticulture, floriculture and vegetable growing farmers. The MLA wants exclusion of sugar cane and tobacco growers from the scheme apart from those having government jobs or paying income tax. ""Farmers who are totally dependent on agriculture or allied activities should be covered under the scheme,"" he said.As regards implementation, Bonde has suggested that maximum Rs 5,000 be credited directly in the farmers' accounts linked to Aadhaar in the month of June, before sowing activities begin. Banks should be allowed to deduct farmer's share for the PM Agriculture Insurance Scheme from this money as it would protect them against environmental and climatic damages. On 7/12 record, crop pattern should be noted and concerned farmers should be asked to submit income-expenditure details of the previous year. This will help in assessing the income of farmers, Bonde said.""Considering the total number of farmers in the state, the government will require around Rs 5,000 crore to implement this scheme. This amount can be raised by way of profession tax,"" Bonde said.""Our government has promised to double the income of farmers, but to achieve this goal it is necessary to bring down the production cost as MSP cannot be increased to that extent,"" Bonde said adding hence farmers, especially in suicide-affected regions, should be brought under the government-controlled direct benefit scheme.Amravati: Even though the monsoon has delayed its presence, farmers in the district have started sowing operations, albeit on a low scale, following few good spells over last three days.The district has recorded an average rainfall of 84.3mm till June 27, which is moderate when compared to 178.3mm for the same date last year. Dharni tehsil has recorded the highest rainfall of 129.0mm so far, while Chandur Bazar tehsil has received the lowest rainfall of just 43.0mm. The annual average rainfall for the district is 814.5mm. 131.4mm of annual average rainfall was expected to date, however, the score is 10.4mm only.Despite the gloomy picture, rains of the last three days lashing all tehsils in strong spells have lit hopes and brought cheers among farmers.Till June 27, Amravati taluka has received 54.2mm rainfall as against last year's figures of 202.4mm for the same period.

Earlier, they only received Rs 2,500 for the same quantity.For the last many years, sugarcane farmers in Marayur were hit hard by the continuous fall in jaggery prices. Due to this, many farmers avoided sugarcane farming and started cultivating vegetables and other crops like arecanut, coconut and coffee.

But now, from 2,700 acres the sugarcane cultivation in these areas has been reduced to 1,200 acres.

GiriAlmond is a healthy snack that young affluent adults in the country have turned to quell their sporadic urge to eat, said experts at a seminar on diet and fitness organised by Almond Board of California here on Tuesday.As per a recent survey conducted in the country, 97 per cent of affluent Indians like snacking on almonds, followed by fruits and other dry fruits.In the survey published early this year 3,037 affluent urban men and women between 18-35 years were interviewed across Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Nagpur, Bhopal and Coimbatore.The study indicates that affluent Indians had turned to healthy snacking, that not just tickles the taste buds but contributes to nutrition intake.Interestingly, 72 per cent of Hyderabadis want snacks to be healthy and tasty as against fried food. Also, the citys affluent preferred snacking in the evening to overcome fatigue and exhaustion.However, 30 per cent of young affluent people in the country snack when they undergo stress.Stress snacking or eating when not hungry is high in the city and Bangalore even as people in Mumbai, Chandigarh and Bhopal are least inclined to snack when under stress.The study also found that 97 per cent of young and affluent Indians prefer to snack on almonds when happy, followed by fruits. In cities like Bangalore (99 pc), Chandigarh (99 pc) and Coimbatore (99 pc) youngsters overwhelmingly prefer almonds for snacks, the study said.Further, unlike popular perception, a whopping 82 pc of young and affluent adults say that they do not feel guilt after snacking. As much as 92 per cent of young adults in Mumbai say they seldom feel guilty after snacking. While these are the fun facts about almond snacking in the country, speaking at the seminar on diet and fitness, Sheela Krishnaswamy, a well-known Bangalore-based diet and nutrition consultant said, Increasing disposable incomes, a need for convenience owing to fast-paced lifestyles and a cultural tradition of snacking have contributed to overall trend towards snacking in India. As a consequence, snacking has sub-consciously become a part of our daily routine. However, uncontrolled and mindless snacking on unhealthy foods, coupled with sedentary lifestyle has contributed to a rapid rise in lifestyle-related disorders.According to Ms. Krishnaswamy, it is important to ensure that snacking habits are healthy. Healthy options like fruits or a handful of nutritious almonds which may have satiating properties that promote feelings of fullness, can be a substitute to unhealthy snacking or overeating, she said.Further, almonds can also help lower the blood sugar impact of carbohydrate foods, experts said."

After all, the last thing someone with, say, diabetes and hypertension, wants is a company rep to leap out from behind a screen and exclaim: ""Don't eat that gulab jamun!""Seriously, though, in what appears to be a well thought out programme, several insurance companies have launched carrot-and-stick policies to keep their policyholders in shape.Play by the rules, live a healthy lifestyle, and the companies offer you various benefits, including reduced annual premiums; fall off the wagon and you'll have to pay higher premiums.All of these wellness programmes are for people with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cancer and other lifestyle ailments.To keep discreet but thorough checks on their policyholders, the companies have tied up with gymnasiums, dieticians, doctors and fitness consultants - and they believe it will help policyholders stay on the straight and narrow road to fitness.

These two completely extreme conditions known to cause a lot of discomfort.Researchers from Bengaluru and Dresden in Germany have found that the same sugar (trehalose) protects cells from two problems they face - dehydration and freezing - in two extremely different climatic conditions.Tests on yeast cells and roundworms have shown that they survive extreme dehydration by packing their cells with trehalose and that the same also protects cells from freezing or thawing, a finding pegged to have significant practical implication in biotechnology.Hypothesising that the Glyoxylate Shunt might be conserved across kingdoms of life, the researchers teamed up to prove their idea in two vastly different organisms - worms and yeast.An important outcome of this research lies in stimulating future studies on the role of the Glyoxylate Sh unt in drought resistance in plants. This work could also be useful in the field of cryogenic preservation. Stating that though they already knew how trehalose is produced, researchers said: ""What remained unknown was how cells redirect their energies towards making this protective molecule.""The work by scientists from the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bengaluru and the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG), Germany, published in the journal eLife, identifies the well-known text-book pathway called the 'Glyoxylate Shunt', as the main conduit for directing resources into trehalose production. Leading the German team was Teymuras V Kurzchalia.""In the growth phase, the chief metabolic processes in cells are focussed on generating energy and manufacturing material for reproduction,"" it says, adding that during this time, trehalose generation is unnecessary.However, when preparing to tide over harsh conditions such as dehydration, cells need to funnel material and energy into synthesising trehalose.The Glyoxylate Shunt, known to function in bacteria, fungi, round worms and plants, is recognised now as a powerful pathway that can rewire and divert resources towards making protective molecules like trehalose. Therefore, when a cell needs to switch metabolic gears from a reproductive mode into a mode preparative to surviving dehydration, this pathway provides an important switch.Though the Glyoxylate Shunt has long been known to operate in these organisms, especially in plants during seed germination, its actual biological function remained elusive. ""We have shown that the Glyoxylate Shunt has an essential physiological function. It plays a crucial role in providing organisms with the protection they need to survive dehydration,"" Sunil Laxman, one of the authors of the paper, said.Laxman said his team is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms of how the Glyoxylate Shunt is regulated, and how it coordinates with other metabolic pathways to balance various functions in the cell, especially under conditions such as dehydration or freezing."

The tasters did not know of the difference, and the dishes were made to look the same.The researchers found that, although there was no overall difference in the amount of food eaten between the groups, individuals with defective MC4R ate almost double the amount of high fat korma than lean individuals (95 percent more), the university said in a statement.They also ate 65 percent more of the high-fat korma than other obese individuals without the genetic quirk.Dessert roundIn a second part of the study, the participants were given Eton mess, a dessert made of strawberries, whipped cream and pieces of meringue.

One in 100 obese people have a defect in the MC4R gene which makes them more likely to put on weight, said the statement.For these individuals, the fact that the MC4R pathway is not working may led them to preferring high-fat foods without realising it.The reason for the sugar aversion was not clear.MC4R is only one of several genes implicated in obesity to date.

On March 28, the 55-year-old widow stood outside the district collector's office and poured kerosene on herself.The suicide attempt was an eerie parallel to the tragic case of the farmer, Madhav Kadam, from Marathwada's Nanded district who swallowed poison outside Mantralaya two weeks ago because he received only a portion of the drought aid due to him. Kadam died but Surekha was rescued just before she lit the match. ""I was pursuing the relief cheque for three months. I was totally frustrated,"" said Mane. Some days earlier she had visited the collector's office and handed over a note about her intention to kill herself.The money was finally transferred to her account the evening of her suicide attempt. ""The problem was that her account had become non-operational. There were not enough transactions,"" said Osmanabad collector Prashant Narnaware. We received the relief money from the state in February and most of it has been distributed,"" he added.With drought aid now being distributed by cheque, technical glitches and the lack of bank accounts are proving to be barriers in sending the money to farmers. In February, relief money worth Rs 498 crore was returned to the state. In the arid belt of Marathwada which is experiencing its fourth drought in five years, farmers are on the edge and every bit of relief helps. This is the second consecutive year of drought in which all the 8,522 villages across eight districts have been impacted. Water levels in the region's dams are down to just 4.5%. Officials estimate crop losses over the last year to be as high as 65%.Already this year, as many as 244 farmer suicides have been reported in Marathwada. These account for 21% of the cases reported in 2015.Among the victims was Surekha's husband, who swallowed poison in his field just six months ago, unable to cope with a Rs 2 lakh debt. ""The compensation I received after his death and the Rs 12,444 I got as crop relief has already gone to creditors,"" she said.Officials claim the employment guarantee scheme is offering work to struggling farmers. As many as 1.18 lakh people across Marathwada's eight districts got work a fortnight ago.Yet on the ground, migration is on the rise and farmers are finding it difficult to tap into the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) scheme work. Farmers also say that MNREGA wages are much lower than the market. Also, the wages are not given, which makes it less appealing for casual workers.In Latur's Masurdi village, over 300 residents have migrated to Pune, Mumbai and Bhiwandi in the last few months. ""Earlier around 50 villagers used to migrate each year. Many are working as drivers or hamaals in markets or private companies,"" said Masurdi sarpanch Nana Barde.Yet the region is also witnessing a worrying wave of migrants returning early. Marathwada is known for the seasonal migration of sugarcane cutters who travel to western Maharashtra's cane fields for six months each year. ""This year, cane cutters from the village had to travel all the way to Madhya Pradesh to find work and they returned three months early. The crop wasn't enough,"" said contractor Rameshwar Shelke from Osmanabad's Khamaswadi village.It is this crop that water experts in the region blame for exacerbating the water crisis in Marathwada. This historically arid region has 61 sugar factories, and acres of the water-guzzling sugarcane crop.""The water used for one hectare of sugarcane can irrigate over eight hectares of rabi jowar,"" said water expert Pradeep Purandare."

Members of the Tamil Nadu Sugar Cane Growers Association and those who had supplied cane to the mills had been up in arms against the management and staged several agitations seeking payment of arrears.On September 27, when trucks loaded with sugar produced at the mill were about to leave the mills, farmers blocked the vehicles demanding immediate payment of arrears.They staged a black flag demonstration against the administration.During the talks held subsequently, the management promised to clear arrears within 10 days and promised not to move the stocks elsewhere till then.The agitation was withdrawn and the sugar bags were returned to the mill godown from the trucks.However, with arrears yet to be cleared as per the promise made to the growers, the authorities apparently tried to shift sugar stocks from the godown in trucks on Tuesday when growers got wind of the development and rushed to the mills.They blocked the trucks carrying sugar bags and raised slogans denouncing the mill administration for not keeping its word on repayments.Led by association State secretary Kasinathan, the cane growers decried the move to cheat the farmers and resumed their sit-in agitation inside the mill premises."

It will need another Rs. 10 to 20 crore to start crushing again. It is not easy to revive it, he said.Umakanth Nagamarapalli, district central cooperative bank chairman, said the factory was worth only Rs. 40 crore but its accumulated debts were many more times that.The Minister said that a government deputed administration would not be able to run it smoothly.In fact, this has been discussed in detail at the State-level, and some officers have suggested that the government should consider a proposal to set up a new sugar factory, he said.Deputy Commissioner Anurag Tewari said that the government had seized 48,000 tonnes of sugar from the factory and was planning to sell it through NCDEX. The Minister asked officials not to approach NCDEX as higher prices were being offered locally if they chose the open tender route. He said farmers dues would be paid by selling the seized sugar.Give gumboots toavoid snake biteAshok Kheny, MLA, has suggested that the government give away free gumboots to farmers to help them avoid snake bites.Speaking at the KDP meeting here on Saturday, he said many farmers were becoming snake-bite victims as they had no protective footwear.The government is providing many benefits to many sections of the society. Why cant it give shoes to farmers so that they stay safe? he questioned."

For a sector reeling under severe labour shortage, the arrival of the Bangladeshi migrants from Raichur has come as a blessing. Willing to rough it out in the slushy fields, they are the main workforce in the fields in Udupi district. There were fears that paddy cultivation has dipped in Dakshina Kannada district. With migrants giving the much-needed helping hand, things are looking up for paddy farmers.For the migrants, agriculture is their main occupation. They are willing to work for less pay and are fast. They use thread to align the placement of saplings and on an average finish planting 5 acres on a day. For an acre, they demand wages of Rs 3,500, which is less compared to what local labourers would demand.Malathesh, owner of Ganesh Harvesters from Shivamogga, is the contractor for these groups. ""I was associated with the Brahmavar Sugar Factory. In 2004, when the factory closed, I had no option but to get back to farming for survival. Earlier, I used to depend on local workers. However, it was difficult to manage them. This forced me to bring migrant labourers from North Karnataka. I figured out later that they had no experience of paddy cultivation and the wages were comparatively more and not feasible. They had knowledge of jowar and ragi cultivation. So this year, I brought 28 labourers from Raichur. The Bangladeshi migrants are familiar with rice cultivation,"" says Malathesh.Madhav Mandol of Sindhnur Camp in Raichur came to Karnataka after the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. ""We were thrown out of our country. The then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted us land in Raichur. We have documents like ration card, Aadhaar, and voter ID. We were born here and we know Kannada. However, we still follow our culture and language at home,"" he added.Jyotsna Mandol says that it is the drought that forced them to migrate in search of jobs. ""We have eight men and 20 women here. We have been in Udupi from the past one month. We work in the paddy fields in Raichur. But there was no rain and we had no field work,"" she rues.Sankari Mandol, another migrant, says they have boarding facility at Belkunja, Karkala. ""We have enough contracts from Hejmadi, Palimaru, Bolanjigutte and surrounding places."""

As Congress and NCP were contesting elections jointly, Patil family had to support its arch rival NCP candidate Dhananjay Mahadik.

Though Satej Patil in December last year defeated Amals father Mahadevrao Mahadik in legislative councils election, the rift between the leaders is not yet over.

Meera, who was born and brought up in America and is a seventh grader in Sartartia Middle School in Sugar Land, began to think hard: would it be really possible for India's underprivileged to replace their incandescent bulbs with LED lamps that are over seven times as expensive?""I thought this is something I could help with. And it's then I had this eureka moment,"" Meera told ET Magazine over phone and email.The 13-year-old got down to drafting a letter which she sent out to ""random people that I could find in our family phone book"", explaining the government's objective of reducing greenhouse gases as well as taking electricity to the poorest villages in India. The problem, however, as she pointed out in the letter, is that although the government was subsidising the cost of LED bulbs , they would still be out of reach of the poorest sections of the society where the maximum impact will be felt.Meera's letter was a plea for donations that would enable her to distribute LED bulbs on her visit to India. ""Electricity is empowerment. In rural areas, it helps kids study after dusk, it helps ease the workload of people, it improves agricultural output,"" she explained to her potential donors.Meera says she has collected $2,079, or Rs 1.4 lakh, which means she would be able to buy and distribute about 1,600 LED bulbs on her India visit early next month. ""I sent letters on a wing and a prayer. What shocked me the most was when I received my first cheque,"" she says. Her mother Sunanda, who is a cofounder of a media portal, wrote a letter to Union power minister Piyush Goyal, expressing Meera's desire to visit India and be a part of the government's LED awareness campaign.""Yes, we have sent Meera a confirmation. The young girl will buy LED bulbs with the funds that she has collected and distribute those among the needy in Delhi. The programme is scheduled some time in the first week of July,"" says Saurabh Kumar, managing director, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture company of four power PSUs  NTPC, PFC, REC and Powergrid. EESL procures LED bulbs from private-sector manufacturers through competitive bidding and then sells those at a fixed retail price of Rs 85 (price varies depending on a state's local taxes). As many as 11.7 crore bulbs have already been replaced with LED, with the government sticking to a deadline of March 2019 to make India a fully LED lamp nation.""The event (with Meera) in Delhi will be organised with the aim of spreading awareness regarding energy efficiency, and also to motivate more children to come forward and replicate such noble initiatives,"" says a Union power ministry spokesperson, adding that Sunanda had contacted the ministry for logistical support in distributing LED bulbs.Meera's letter begins with a big-picture view of the global environmental challenge. ""I am sure I am not the first person to tell you that our planet is undergoing the most serious environment challenge today and what happens in the next few years may decide whether we have a healthy planet or have set a course towards its destruction.But what if I told you that we can all actually do something about it?"" She sent out as many as 500 letters, many by post.Born to a Punjabi father and Kashmiri mother, Meera says she often has India on her mind  its people, the hustle and bustle in the bazaars, festivals, her ancestral home in Punjab and, above all, the ""feeling of belonging and the smiles from everyone"".""The joy of participating in Diwali, Holi and other colourful festivals rejuvenates me,"" she says, adding that she is connected to India every moment because of her ongoing training in Bharatnatyam and Hindustani classical music. Meera also plays the flute in her school band.Meera says her favourite subjects in school are mathematics and English, and she loves to debate. ""My interest in mathematics developed as I love playing with numbers,"" she says. She has not done any career planning as yet but reckons she will be in the field of environment.But what was the trigger for getting involved in environmental issues in general and India's LED scheme in particular? ""My grandfather is passionate about environmental causes. He has instilled in me the idea of being a custodian of the environment and leaving a better planet than we have inherited,"" she says.After distributing LED bulbs in Delhi, Meera will travel to her ancestral home in Phagwara in Punjab. The locals will surely see her in a new light."

Produces of sugarcane farmers are consumed by sugar mills, which sell the waste to distilleries. At a time when clearing dues of sugarcane farmers is proving difficult, how the decision to ban liquor can be taken, he said.The molasses and other waste of sugar mills, should be utilized for ethanol production. Ethanol is sold on higher price to mix in petrol. In case of excess production of ethanol, it can be exported to other countries.

Today, his home is the open ground in Ghatkopar's Bhatwadi. He lives with his wife and two children in a small rectangular patch marked by four sticks. With no roof or walls, it offers no shade against the searing heat. The family's belonging hang from trees, safe from the pigs below.Chavan is among the hundreds of drought refugees who have made their way to Mumbai over the last six months as work and water dried up in their villages. Around 350 families are sheltering at the Bhatwadi maidan. With no toilets, they take a bath in tents pitched with saris. ""I worked at the Jai Shiv Shankar sugar factory in Nanded but it shut down two years ago. My two-acre field had also withered. I had no choice but to leave,"" says Chavan. The rest of his neighbours are less fortunate: they own no land at all.By 8am, groups of migrants empty onto the nearby roads, hoping to be hired as daily labourers. At best, they land odd jobs twice a week, mainly cleaning gutters or carrying loads on construction sites. They make Rs 300-400 a day, more than half of which is spent on food.With farm work at a stand-still, the rural job scheme MNREGA would have been a lifeline for the families. The scheme offers 100 days of work per household in rural India. The Centre even declared it would offer 150 days of employment in drought-affected regions.Yet barely any of these villagers from Nanded have been able to tap into the scheme. ""If we could get work in the village, why would we come here?"" asks Jaipal Rathod, a landless labourer. I have been trying to get a MNREGA job card for years without success,"" he says.Through 2015-16, the state provided 7.63 crore days of work under the scheme, according to the MNREGA website. This was higher than 2014-15 but much lower than the 8.72 crore days of work provided during the drought year of 2012-13.In fact, the state does not come close to the target of 100 days of work per household."

But there are practical difficulties and the government must give financial assistance to implement its plan. Farmers and sugar mills cannot implement drip irrigation on their own,"" chairman of the federation Shivajirao Nagavade told TOI on Monday.He added that the sugar industry is the backbone of the rural economy with thousands of farmers and farm labourers dependent on the crop.""If the government and the experts continue to target sugarcane growing farmers and sugar mills and hold them responsible for the water scarcity, the sugar industry will collapse and farmers will be in distress. Who will be responsible for destroying their livelihoods? Sugarcane is the only crop which guarantees good returns,"" Nagavade added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently chaired a high-level meeting on the drought and scarcity situation in parts of Maharashtra, has told chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to increase water-use efficiency through drip and sprinkler irrigation, stating that drip irrigation in sugarcane increases the quality of sugar.Fadnavis has assured Modi that the state government is working on a plan to ensure that all the sugarcane growing area in Maharashtra comes under drip irrigation in three years.However, the sugar lobby, dominated by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, has been resisting the move and is supported by sugar barons in the BJP and the Shiv Sena.Nagavade said the notion about cane farmers using excess water is wrong. ""Earlier, it was wafa system where the flow was stopped after every few metres to water the cane crop. Now, a majority of farmers use eksari system where water flows from the top to the bottom.""Despite the drought, sugar mills completed their crushing season, this year. As many as 32 sugar mills, the highest in the state, had a successful cane-crushing season.In Latur district, where section 144 of the CrPC was clamped to protect water sources, 12 sugar mills have been defiantly siphoning off huge quantities of water for sugarcane crushing and the state government, which had earlier announced that no mill in the drought zone would be allowed to crush, remained a silent observer owing to pressure from the sugar lobby.Latur-based water expert Atul Deulgaonkar said it is a complicated matter. ""Even in the drought-affected areas of Marathwada, thousands of farmers are dependent on sugarcane as it is the only crop which gives them assured returns. The government must have a plan before taking any hasty steps while shifting cane cultivation to drip irrigation,"" he said ."

The price has reached a level desired by farmers owing to 40 per cent import duty imposed on sugar by the Central Government.While the Central Government has expressed desire to lower import duty, the Indian Sugar Mills Association has sought retention of the existing level, reasoning out that the production during 2016-17 will far exceed consumption in domestic market.To check artificial increase of prices caused by hoarding, the Central Government permitted States to fix stock-holding limit earlier this month.According to farmers, the price of Rs. 40 per kg for sugar will not affect the common man since, on an average, a familys monthly consumption does not exceed two kg.Unpaid duesFarmers in the district exuded confidence that sugar mills in the district will be able to settle unpaid dues for procured canes in their command areas to the extent of Rs. 70 crore over the next few months.The mills will be keen to settle the dues since they would be desirous of optimising production to their full capacity in the coming crushing season, Subi Thalapathy, representative of Thadapalli-Arakankottai Ayacut Farmers Association said.However, the dues pertain only to the Fair and Remunerative Price of Rs. 2,300 per tonne fixed by the Central Government and not the State Advisory Price of an additional Rs. 550 per tonne.While the 15 cooperative mills and two other government-controlled mills pay the SAP as well, the private mills have maintained that they will abide by the stand of the Central Government for scrapping SAP.Ethanol productionWith the sugar prices stabilising, mills are not keen to scale up production of ethanol, it is learnt.Though Rs. 49.50 is offered per litre of ethanol, sugar production at the prevailing price is more remunerative."

58f56dbda3d24b0b70c21424,Bitter pill for diabetics?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bitter-pill-for-diabetics/article8601941.ece,2016-05-17,"If there is such a thing as a Richter scale for the Indian pharmaceutical industry, then the Centres announcement in March banning a clutch of Fixed Dose Combinations (FDC) did register pretty high on it.There was a hue and cry from a vibrant industry employing all manner and form of combinations in the manufacture of drugs. There were arguments in favour of the ban and against it. In the din, a group of people  linked by their condition and impacted by this announcement  struggled to come to terms with the ban. With a bunch of diabetes drugs now being docked, patients on FDC oral glycaemic agents, for example, were left wondering whether they had been prescribed banned drugs.The rationale behind going after the FDCs is the fact that there are some irrational combinations. Our point is that some important rational combinations which are very useful for diabetics, and have been in use over about a decade, have been included in the general list, says a senior diabetologist based in Chennai, Dr. A. Panneerselvam. With some of the diabetes FDCs, we have managed to achieve excellent blood sugar control in patients on insulin, he adds.A case in point is the dual drug combo of pioglitazone (7.5 mg) and metformin (500 mg). Pioglitazone came under a cloud a couple of years ago after some reports claimed it caused bladder cancer, but it was cleared and declared safe to use. At 82, Adikesavan has been undergoing treatment for diabetes for nearly 30 years now. In 2007, I was on heavy doses of insulin, and was struggling with blood sugar control. That is when my diabetologist put me on the pioglitazone 7.5 mg + metformin (500 mg) combination, and that seemed like a little miracle for me. Today, Im trying to understand why that drug should be banned, he says.The director and consultant diabetologist, Dr. A. Ramachandrans Diabetes Hospitals, Dr. Nanditha Arun, says, We do not use the three-dose combinations that much, but the two-dose FDCs have helped patients. Now, they have to go on to take the same drugs, but instead of in a combo, as different drugs, adding to the pill burden.Pill fatigueThe nub of the issue is perhaps that  pill fatigue. For a person diagnosed with diabetes, there are multiple risk factors. Being a metabolic disorder, we often have to start with more than one drug at the time of diagnosis. And the drugs are for life. So combinations help by bringing down the number of drugs that a patient takes, she adds.There are indeed irrational combinations even in the treatment of diabetes, says Dr. Panneerselvam, such as those that try to add vitamins to oral glycemic agents, and sometimes statins. We do not recommend those drugs. The ones that have been banned are those that are rational, and of immense benefit to patients. The Drug Controller General of India should consider withdrawing at least these combinations, he says.Some patients were panic-stricken the moment the drugs were withdrawn from the market, because they thought the doctor had written out prescriptions for banned drugs.For example, Parvati S., a 45-year-old who was diagnosed with diabetes two years ago, says she was anxious about having taken an unsafe drug the moment she heard that the drug was banned. A senior diabetologist, Dr. V. Shantaram, explains that many patients did have similar queries. The moment you increase the number of drugs, compliance comes down. While cost might be a minor issue in this particular case, compliance is what we are bothered about when we increase the number of drugs, or split the combinations. Patients stop taking them.A question of pharmacokineticsDr. V. Mohan of Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre, Chennai, takes a contrarian view. With combination drugs, one tends to lose flexibility, he says. For instance, sulphonylurea needs to be given before food and metformin after food. So, as a combination, when do you recommend the drug? Before or after food?There are other issues too, since FDCs come in different strengths. Increasing the dose of one drug means you also unwittingly increase the dose of the other drug in the combo which might be unnecessary. We are not sure if the pharmacokinetics is as predicted with these doses, he says, however, readily acknowledging that compliance is a key issue, and one that diabetologists cannot wish away.Pharmacovigilance is indeed significant in a market such as India. As the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, the movement for public health, puts it, The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization should specify inclusion criteria based on clear scientific evidence for FDCs, and all FDCs that do not fulfil the criteria should be banned.It is crucial to get rid of the bad eggs in the basket. But equally important is ensuring that patients do continue to benefit from taking rational combinations that also facilitate compliance.See online for full versionramya.kannan@thehindu.co.in"

For a sector reeling under severe labour shortage, the arrival of the Bangladeshi migrants from Raichur has come as a blessing. Willing to rough it out in the slushy fields, they are the main work force in the fields in Udupi district.There were fears that paddy cultivation has dipped in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts. With migrants giving the much needed helping hand, things are looking up for paddy farmers.The migrants are willing to work for less pay and are quick. They use thread to align the placement of the saplings and on an average finish planting five acres on a day. For an acre they demand wages of Rs 3,500, which is less compared to what local labourers would have demanded for the same work.Malathesh, owner of Ganesh Harvesters from Shivamogga, is the contractor for these groups. ""I was associated with the Brahmavar Sugar Factory. In 2004 when the factory closed, I had no option but to get back to farming to survive. Earlier I used to depend on local workers. However, it was difficult to manage them. This forced me to bring migrant labourers from North Karnataka. I figured out later that they had no experience of paddy cultivation and the wages were comparatively more and not feasible. They had knowledge of jowar and ragi cultivation. So this year I brought 28 labourers from Raichur. The Bangladeshi migrants are familiar with rice cultivation,"" says Malathesh.Madhav Mandol of Sindhnur Camp in Raichur came to Karnataka after the Bangladesh Liberation war of 1971. ""We were thrown out of our country. The then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted us land in Raichur. We have documents like ration card, Aadhaar, and voter ID. We were born here and we know Kannada. However, we still follow our culture and language at home,"" he added.Jyotsna Mandol says that it is the drought that forced them to migrate in search of jobs. ""We have eight men and 20 women here. We have been in Udupi from the past one month. We work in the paddy fields in Raichur. But there was no rain and we had no field work,"" she rues.Sankari Mandol, another migrant, says they have housing facility at Belkunja, Karkala to stay.""We are here from the past one month. We have enough contracts from Hejmadi, Palimaru, Bolanjigutte and surrounding places to be here fro some more time."""

The condition not just leaves patients writhing in pain but restricts their ease of movement, making even routine activities such as wearing clothes, combing their hair and attending to personal hygiene monumental tasks.People who fall under the 40 to 60 age bracket are said to be most vulnerable, especially women, as the ailment causes severe pain and stiffness in the shoulder area at nights and gradually gets worse as it progresses, say experts.""Just like one watches out for symptoms such as excessive thirst, passing excess urine, a slow healing wound and unexplained tiredness, one also needs to watch out for frozen shoulder as this too is now commonly regarded as an indication of diabetes,"" said Dr Sunil Apsingi, director orthopaedics, Maxcure hospitals.Frozen shoulder can be diagnosed with the help of a MRI or CT scan which will show a fluid build up in the affected area in patients suffering from the problem. Flexible tissue that surrounds the shoulder joint (known as joint capsule) will also be inflamed and thickened. ""Frozen shoulder can be treated with pain killers, shoulder steroid injections and physiotherapy. It rarely requires surgical intervention. But since shoulder disabilities associated with diabetes have a great impact on the quality of life, diabetic screening should include mandatory screening for frozen shoulder too,"" Apsingi adds.How physiotherapists treat frozen shoulder? ""We generally recommend several exercises for diabetics detected with frozen shoulder as they need to be fit as physical activity is an important component of weight loss plan. These exercises include pendulum stretch, towel stretch, finger walk, cross body reach, armpit stretch, outward rotation and inward rotation,"" said Ann Kritika Mathew, fitness consultant and physiotherapist, Truweight.Endocrinologists insist that people watch out for frequent eye infections such as a stye and chalazion (inflammation of the eye), fungal infections such as Candida and skin infections as well as they are other important symptoms could suggest that a person is suffering from diabetes.However, doctors warn that diabetes may also be asymptomatic. Speaking on the issue, Dr Sridevi Paladugu, consultant endocrinologist, Apollo Hospitals, Hyderguda, said, ""There can be a prolonged phase of asymptomatic diabetes as those suffering from it show no symptoms at all. Hence, screening procedures are recommended for non-diabetic people after they cross 30 years."""

It has been developed jointly by NBRI and the central institute for medicinal and aromatic plants (CIMAP), CSIR's research units.""CSIR's premier research institutions have developed and established the efficacy of BGR-34. Modern diabetes drugs are known for their side effects and toxicity, but BGR-34 works by controlling blood sugar and limiting harmful effects of other drugs,"" said Rawat.Six herbs were selected after in-depth study of over 500 herbs. These include Daruharidra (berberis asristata), Giloy (tinospora cordifolio), Vijaysar (pterocarpus marsupium), Gudmar (gymnema sylvestre), Majeeth (rubia cordifolia), and Methika (trigonella foenum-graecum), combined in different fractions and quantity and processed meticulously to develop the anti-diabetic formulation.The herbs were further subjected to optimization studies to establish the right proportion, Rawat said.Senior scientist CSIR-NBRI Sanjeev Kumar Ojha said, ""One of the critical ingredient inhibits DPP-4 and enhances insulin secretion. The product passed several battery of tests and showed hypoglycemic activity in experimental subjects.""Shrivastava maintained that BGR-34 has been economically priced at Rs 5 per tablet."

Domestic sugar realisations for mills  at around 35,000 per tonne in the north and 33,000 per tonne in south and western India  are already higher than current export realisations.Exports would bring only about 32,000 per tonne for mills that are located close to ports at current international sugar prices of around $500 per tonne even without the impact of export duty. Since domestic consumption, which is pegged at around 25.5 million tonnes, is likely to be higher than the domestic production estimated at 25.2 million tonnes for 2015-16 season (October-September), marketability of domestic sugar would not be a challenge, analysts tracking the sector said.""It is unlikely that domestic sugar mills would have been exporting any significant quantities of sugar even without this additional duty,"" said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice president and co-head, corporate sector ratings, ICRA.""At the current level of domestic and international sugar prices, exports are uncompetitive vis-a-vis domestic sales for most sugar mills, especially for those based in the North, which have an additional freight disadvantage of 1,000-1,500 per tonne vis-a-vis mills located closer to the shore in southern and western India,"" ratings agency ICRA said.""However, this (export duty) imposition may dampen prospects of further price rise, first by discouraging additional exports, which can result in price rise in a tight market scenario, and by demonstrating government intent to restrain price rise,"" Majumdar said.Consecutive years of high sugar production since the 2012-13 season had caused a surplus in the domestic sugar market, with stocks increasing to around 9.5 million tonnes by September last year (around 4 1/2 months of consumption). The stocks typically cover 3-4 months of consumption.With a surplus in the international sugar market leading to lower prices in the global market, sugar prices touched a three-year low of 23,000 per tonne in in July last year. This, in turn, had resulted in significant losses for most sugar mills which led to stagnation in cane prices and build-up of cane dues to farmers.The union government fixed a mandatory sugar export quota for all the mills for the 2015-16 season, linking it with availing a subsidy of 45 per tonne for payment of sugarcane, in order to help the sugar industry. The upswing in international prices enabled mills to export almost 1.6 million tonnes of sugar till May this year."

Further exports are unlikely to take place with this decision.With retail sugar prices soaring to around Rs 40/kg from Rs 30/kg six months ago, the government has taken various steps to contain prices including withdrawal of export-linked production subsidy and imposition of stock limits on traders.Last week, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan had announced that his ministry has proposed to ""levy 25 per cent custom duty on export of sugar"" to keep exports under control.""Global sugar prices are rising and therefore traders may increase the export of sugar to make profit,"" he had said.Industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) did not offer any comments immediately.However, a senior industry official welcomed the decision in view of tight demand-supply situation expected in the next 2016-17 marketing year starting October.With imposition of export duty, the official said that exports have become unviable.An increase of 50 per cent in global sugar prices in last three months due to disruption in supply from Brazil had made exports viable.The country's sugar production is estimated to decline to 25 million tonnes in 2015-16, as against 28.3 million tonnes last year. The annual domestic demand is pegged at 26 million tonnes.Moreover, the government has forecast further decline in output in next year at 23-24 million tonnes.

The five-year project titled `Sweet Bloom' will see SBI conducting evaluation trials for the newly released varieties at nine factories across the state.""The point is to identify sugarcane varieties that will give a high cane yield and better sugar recovery in specific locations. Because, different varieties are developed for different soil, climatic and irrigation conditions,"" SBI director Bakshi Ram said.The cost of the project will be around `46.2 lakh and will be funded by SISMA.""The initiative is aimed at improving the cane yield and sugar recovery which will immensely benefit the farmers,"" SISMA-TN president Dr Palani G Periasamy said.The project will include two sets of evaluation trials that will be spread across a period of five years. The tissue culture based seed material will be provided by SBI to the factories, which will cultivate them in their land.

The aim is to identify lo cation specific sugarcane varieties that are non-flowering, drought tolerant and have red rot resistance. The trial locations have been identified by a team comprising scientists from the institute and senior cane managers from the sugar mills based on the geographical location, soil and climatic conditions."

The dues for 201314 and 201415 involved 42 sugar factories.Defending the governments action of offering purchase tax exemption rather than initiating action against defaulting factories, the Minister said such a situation had arisen in the wake of legal hurdles as sugar mills had approached courts.While some mills had obtained stay on auctioning their sugar stock that had been seized by the government, the Supreme Court had ordered status quo on payment of the State Advisory Price following a petition by the mills, he said.We have come out with this offer to find an out-of-court solution, he said. According to him, the purchase tax exemption may cost about Rs. 400 crore to the State exchequer if all sugar factories opted for it.The Minister also announced that the government had extended the deadline  for the scheme under which farmers get waiver of interest if they pay the principal amount of loan  from March-end to September 30.Dues to growers201314  Rs. 278 cr.201415  Rs. 102 cr.201516  Rs. 1,950 cr."

A farmer displays the order in his field near Ambur. Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe delay in settling dues for sugarcane crushed last season has left hundreds of farmers in dismay. Financially hit, the sugarcane farmers say they are in no position to take up cutting this season.Like the Vellore Cooperative Sugar Mill at Ammundi, the Ambur mill too has not settled the dues for sugarcane supplied last crushing season. With the price per tonne last year being Rs. 2,550, farmers registered with the Ambur Cooperative Sugar Mill said the mill is yet to pay Rs. 300 per tonne till date.The Ambur mill has issued cutting order for the forthcoming crushing season. But farmers said they do not have the money to pay for labourers, and cannot borrow as they were already facing mounting debts.Ramamoorthy, a farmer in Kammavanpettai said, I supplied 150 to 160 tonnes of sugarcane to the Ambur mill last season. I am yet to receive the pending amount of Rs. 300 per tonne. This year, I have raised sugarcane on more than 1.5 acres of land but how can I bear the cutting cost for labourers without the dues being settled?Farmers said that they will have to pay Rs. 450 to Rs. 500 per tonne for labourers as cutting cost. Apart from this, they will have to give one kilo rice and Rs. 25-30 for cooking for each labourer.While the government bears the transportation cost, the farmers said they end up paying the lorry driver. Our family has been supplying sugarcane for the mill for close to 30 years but this is the first time that dues have not been settled for nearly a year. In the previous season, the pending amount was settled in six months, he added.D. Kumaran, another sugarcane farmer, had supplied 110 tonnes of sugarcane last season.The mill officers told us that the bills will be settled before Pongal but nothing has happened till now, he said.It is a different problem for another farmer, K. Anbazhagan of Saduperipalayam in Tiruvannamalai district, who had supplied 60 tonnes of cane last season. The mill had diverted the cane to another mill and I am yet to receive the full payment, he said.There are farmers who had borrowed up to Rs. 1 lakh to meet the cutting cost, and had also taken the governments interest-free loan for planting. As the dues have not been settled, the farmers could not repay the loans on time. The interest rate has shot up to 14 per cent now, he said.An official of the Ambur Cooperative Sugar Mill said at a Minister level meeting, it was said that the dues will be settled before Pongal."

They want Rs. 3,600 a tonne. However, a section of growers are happy that the State Government had announced the SAP without succumbing to the pressure tactics of sugar mills.The Centre had fixed the Fair and Remunerative Price for cane procured during the 2015-16 season at Rs. 2,300 a tonne. The State Government declared an incentive of Rs. 550 including transportation charges of Rs. 100 a tonne, for a total State Advised price of Rs. 2,850.Though all public sector and most of the cooperative sector sugar mills had paid money for suppliers last year, private mills had piled up arrears on incentive to farmers for the cane supplied over the past two years. It is close to Rs. 950 crore. Under these circumstances, the Chief Minister has announced the SAP. We wonder whether the growers will get any benefit. We look up to her to ensure that, says president of the Pettaivaithalai Cane Growers Association, Tiruchi, K. Anbalagan.Adverse market conditions have forced the sugar mills to default on payment to suppliers. Though the SAP announcement is welcome, only removal of Value Added Tax on sugar and reduction of VAT on its by products will help mills turn profitable and facilitate payment to farmers. The Chief Minister must help growers in asking the mills to pay the current dues and arrears in one go for the growers to really benefit from her decision, according to the State technical secretary, Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations, G. Ajeethan of Namakkal.Claiming that the cost of cultivation has gone up and the SAP did not meet the demands of growers, general secretary of the Federation of Farmers Associations in Delta Districts Arupathy P. Kalyanam opines that the thrust of the State Government must be on ensuring that the private sugar mills and some cooperative mills that have defaulted on payments pay the arrears to the growers in one settlement. The State Government must have declared Rs. 3,600 per tonne for the sugarcane purchased from farmers, he adds.Inquiries in the sugar industry circles indicated that there was a concerted attempt to delay the SAP announcement and even if it were to be done a hiked incentive was sought to be avoided. Ms. Jayalalithaa announced a hiked SAP perhaps with an eye on the Assembly elections, they aver.Sugar mills want the State Government to waive the five per cent VAT on sugar besides reducing the VAT tariff of 14.5 per cent for molasses and 30 per cent for ethanol. That move will enable the mills to pay the arrears and dues to cane growers, they claim.Now, their imports from Maharashtra and Karnataka are cheaper crippling the mills here. Also, the TANGEDCO is yet to pay amount for the power purchased from sugar mills with co generation facility."

With the sugar industry in turmoil, both the farmers as well as the mills are highly disappointed.After a high-level meeting at the Secretariat on Monday, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced that the State has fixed the SAP at Rs. 2,850 a tonne, which is Rs. 550 a tonne more than the statutory Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 2,300 set by the Central government.The SAP includes Rs. 100 per tonne as cost for transporting sugar.With the subsidies given for irrigation to small and medium farmers, the State was ranked first in sugar production, she said in an official release hoping that the governments decision would bring happiness to the cane farmers.Sugarcane farmers have been asking the government to fix SAP for the past three months since the start of the crushing season. For the last two years, the State had fixed the SAP at Rs. 2,650 per tonne.Farmers disappointedMeanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association has expressed disappointment stating that they were expecting Rs. 4,000 per tonne.For the past two years, there was no increase in SAP. This year, they have made it up by giving Rs. 200 more per tonne. In real terms, this is not an increase at all, said D. Ravindran, association general secretary. Private mills have not paid SAP for the past two years amounting to Rs. 600 crore, he said wondering if they would give it this year. Moreover, the area of cultivation and actual production of sugarcane has gone down over the past three years, he said.In a statement, South Indian Sugar Mills Association (Tamil Nadu) secretary S. Chellappa said that paying any higher price over FRP would be beyond the means of sugar mills. Maharashtra, the biggest sugar producing State in the country, has gone for 80:20 formula for payment of FRP, and mills in Karnataka were paying FRP in instalments during the current season, he said.VAT on sugar sales, restrictions on ethanol production and supply, un-remunerative tariff for power exports and steep fall in sugar prices have taken a toll on the financial health of sugar mills. Most of the mills have gone for debt restructuring, and accumulated losses over the past two seasons have led to a liquidity crunch.The SISMA requested the State to remove VAT on sugar sales and the cap on ethanol production and revise power tariff so that mills would have the ability to pay the FRP. The State should consider direct subsidy to farmers to bridge the gap between the SAP and the ability of the mills to pay the same, he demanded."

The authorities have already collected around 30 samples as a precautionary step to prevent adulteration Officials have also appealed to the citizens to make sure that they buy sweets and namkeens from only those shops where the FDA certificates on display.Anand Pardhi, assistant joint divisional commissioner of FDA (food), Aurangabad, said, ""The food safety officers are already on the job of collecting samples of sweets, which would be sent to the FDA laboratory in Pune and Aurangabad for analysis.""He said in a bid to keep tabs on the sale of adulterated food items, especially during the festival season, FDA officials conducted surprise checks at around 10 sweet shops in the city. ""We inspected nearly 10 sweet shops and collected 12 samples of different sweets, five types of oil samples, 9 milk samples and other items such as sugar, sauce, asafoetida and varai,"" he said.One of the things which the food safety officers look into sweets is the colour. There are permitted colours, which are used in items like biscuits, ice cream and some sweets, and although not injurious to health, they are prevented from being used beyond certain limit, said Pardhi pointing out that the use of non-permitted colours is considered as food adulteration.""As festivities are incomplete without sweets, citizens need to check the type of sugar used in preparing sweets as it plays a crucial role not only in taste but also on the toxicity of the final product. Most of the loose sugar we get are not refined using a sulphur- free process,"" Pardhi said.Speaking about the use of mawa or khoya, which is basically dried milk used for making most of the sweets, he said, ""Mawa has fat a content. If this content is not as per the prescribed standard limit, then such mawa cannot be allowed to be used. As per the standard, mawa needs to have minimum 30% milk fats. However, it is difficult to recognise pure mawa. It can be adulterated using sugar and even substances such as starch. Hence, registration or licensing of mawa shops has been made mandatory.""""As a precautionary measure, we have advised confectionery owners to prepare raw materials such as khoya, mawa and ghee themselves rather than buying it from other states. Most of the problems arise owing to inter-state export of products as we do not know how old these are,"" he said.""Though the department has been short-staffed for some years now, with just 14 officials in the division and four in Aurangabad, it is taking all efforts to keep a strict vigil to avoid the sale of adulterated sweets. However, co-operation from citizens through alerts about possible adulteration could help us take more steps,"" Pardhi added."

He told TOI that a site near St John's school, off South Canal Bank Road, has been proposed as the new location for the shop.The problem for the residents, mainly those from the AM Thottam slum, arose in September last year when their ration shop near Chitrakulam in Mylapore was shut and shifted to a corporation school on an interior street near the Mundagakanniamman temple, without prior intimation.""There is no direct bus to this area. We have to get down at Luz signal and walk for one km. It is very difficult to carry the rice, oil and sugar. Knowing this, auto drivers also jacked up rates charging us 65 for a 3km ride,"" said K Lakshmi, 73, a resident of AM Thottam. That effectively translates into 120- 130 for a two-way ride.

Despite assurances from civil supplies officials that the shop would be shifted to a location closer to Mandaveli, it has still not fructified.Natraj said that there was a guideline that a PDS shop should be within two km of a location which had maximum card holders.

Farmers are gearing up to protest against the government and mills in various parts of the state on August 11.Union minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution C R Chaudhary told Parliament recently that due to surplus production during the last four sugar seasons and depressed sugar prices, the liquidity of the sugar mills has been adversely affected, leading to accumulation of cane price arrears to the farmers. ""The Centre has extended soft loans of 4,305 crore to improve the liquidity position of sugar mills across the country, enabling them to clear cane price arrears,"" the minister said.But farmers say their plight has not been addressed either by mill owners or the state government. ""Lack of legal binding to the state-advised price (SAP) has led to the mills not paying our dues. The acreage and production have fallen drastically in the last three years. We fear the state too has given up our cause,"" said Swamimalai Vimalnathan, general secretary, Thanjavur District Farmers' Protection Association. Sugarcane is one of the top crops after paddy across the state, especially in Villupuram, Perambalur, Erode, and Cauvery delta districts. Sugarcane production, according to the agriculture department, has fallen from 340 lakh tonne in 2012 to 264 lakh tonne this year, and the area of cultivation is down from 3.48 lakh hectares to 2.57 lakh hectares.The state government is vested with powers to enforce the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, for timely payment of cane price to farmers, said Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers' Association general secretary D Ravindran. ""The state-advised price is fixed by the state. If the mills don't budge, the state must take over these defaulting mills,"" he said."

This year also, a selection of exotic praline and cranberry sweetmeats is seen in shopfront displays.Mithai shops commonly use mawa, cashewnut paste, dried fruit and nuts, or chocolate as a base and then add different flavours or fillings to each. These are then shaped into moulds. The original favourite 'ukdiche modak' made of rice flour is not readily available off the shelf except the odd restaurant.In the bustling lanes of Thakurdwar, connoisseurs seek out small shops which work a perfect balance with the sugar content. Tuesday evening, the cooks at Swastik Dry Fruits kept bringing out large thaals of anjeer, kesar, orange, rose, strawberry and Cadbury chocolate modak. Ranging from a modest Rs 440 per kg to Rs 600, these were far more palatable than those at a famous Maharashtrian branded store nearby that curiously uses Glucon C to sweeten its modaks.Morbiwala nearby also lays out a delectable array of kiwi fruit, rose, anjeer and chocolate costing up to Rs 880.Residents of Bandra-Khar flock to Regal Plus at Pali Naka for their annual modak treat. Owner Bhushan Bandagle says, ""This year our new guava flavour is the pick of the season. Other bestsellers are black currant, orange, caramel, rose butter scotch and chocolate."" Regal's sweets in milk, mawa, chocolate and dried fruit cost between Rs 680-1,300 per kg. It also has a ""no added sugar"" selection which comes for Rs 1,650 per kg.Meanwhile, the humble 'ukdiche modak' now costs an exorbitant Rs 30 apiece at Modakam restaurant near Siddhivinayak temple. Owner Pushkaraj Gaikar says that this season, his wife and mother have been preparing the sweets at his apartment home rather than handing the task to his chefs at the restaurant. Denying labour trouble, Gaikar says the modaks are softer than before."

Even those who unsuccessfully contested the previous elections to the Assembly, Council and Lok Sabha would come under the scanner in these polls, as they too would be held accountable for the partys performance in their respective constituencies, according to BJP State General Secretary C.T. Ravi.This decision comes close on the heels of the BJPs failure to meet expectations in the recently held Legislative Council elections.Mr. Ravi said the meeting has asked legislators and MPs to consider the ZP/TP polls as a challenge.The meeting also discussed problems in rural areas that have to be included in the proposed district-level manifesto being brought out by the party for the ZP/TP polls. Accusing the State government of neglecting villages and farmers, he alleged that the State had failed to take up effective drought-relief measures.Similarly, the State has failed to ensure that the defaulting sugar mills take soft loans under the Central grants to repay farmers dues, he alleged.

To let the noble cause move smoothly, the NGO has appealed wealthy people, industrialists and philanthropists to extent their support by donating clothes, books, slate, chalks and food items.Anuradha Bhosale, activist at Avani, said, ""The sugarcane cutters have to stay away from their village for three to four months and then migrate to the places which are unknown to them. In such circumstances, the children of such workers have to face severe hardship and frequent migration leads to their educational loss. We are going to start the schools at 10 to 12 sugar mills. We have asked the sugar mill operators to extend their help to help us.""The NGO has asked the district authorities to draft the policy for education of such 'out of school' children."

Check out 'Mallica' and 'Sensation', two unique varities of mango which do not add much to body's sugar level.Displayed at the ongoing Mango Festival organised by UP Tourism, state horticulture department and Awadh Mango Growers Association , the two varieties caught the eye of the calorie conscious tribe.""While Mallica is a hybrid variety grown in Malihabad, Sensation originates from Florida ,"" informed Iqbal Ahmed, a mango grower from Malihabad.He added that Mallica is the progeny of two popular varieties called Neelam and Chausa which are very popular among exporters. ""Mallica has gained popularity for export purpose too because it is tough and large. It is better than its predecessors because it doesn't decay even if not refrigerated.""Sensation, on the other hand, is a native of Florida. It grows in Australia too.

And if you thought it was something exotic, you would be surprised to know that this aromatic excellence is nothing but our favourite tea. Just like coffee houses mushroomed in Victorian England giving the British a new hangout hotspot, a number of tea cafes in the city are becoming the new gupshup addaas for the youngsters. With a number of options in flavours available, these cafes are not only serving freshly brewed tea, but an experience of a unique kind.There has been a visible shift of choice from coffee and other beverages to tea in the last couple of years. A normal day for a Gujarati is never complete without having a cup of tea. ""Though a cup of tea costs more in a lounge than it would have at a kitli, why people prefer these places is because it is a good substitute for other soft drinks that are high on calories. At any other cafe, I would have ordered a glass of soft drink,"" says Khushi Shah, a student.When with your gang of friends, you can never come to consensus considering the large range of teas the cafes in city offer. Surprisingly, the tea has gone beyond the staple milk and sugar combo and Amdavadis have welcomed the change with open arms. Food items, too, are infused with tea now. ""Most of the days, the lounge is sprawling with students till evening and office goers thereafter,"" says a city based tea lounge owner. These cafes offer different flavours from Morocco, Assam, Darjeeling et al.These fancy new cafes sprawling around the city are the new age definition of a usual chai ki kitli where the college goers decide to hangout after their classes. ""We always go to a tea lounge after college. Whether it is near the college or in other areas. The idea is to sit and chat over a cup of chai as compared to going to a coffee house. These tea lounges also offer smoothies, cakes, sandwiches that are infused with tea. Some of the tea houses also have varieties of tea that one can buy to have at home with family. So, in one trip I also meet friends and buy tea for my parents who also love experimenting different types of teas,"" says Sanket Chaudhary, a first year college student."

It's the time of the year when a bowl of sewain is on the mind of every other person across the globe. While you enjoy the sumptuous dessert in its varied formsmilky, kesariya, dry, or the latest fad of sugar-freethere are hundreds of people working hard to ensure that your next bowl of the Eid favourite is on its way in perfection.That the city of Nawabs is a foodie's paradise is common knowledge. We are particular about our sewain and getting the finest strands of the golden dessert needs experience and expertise.Mohammad Ayyub Khan, 65, is one of the city's oldest sewain makers. With 50 years of experience, he walks us through the process which transforms plain flour into a bowl of bliss. His multi-story factory was established 60 years ago by his father Munne Khan. When he started the factory, everything was done manually in a small premises. In the present set-up, there are several electronic machines and large halls. On entering one of these, one sees long white strands on wooden hangers as high as 15 feet from the ground.Explaining the method, Khan says it begins with putting maida (all-purpose flour) through a filtering process till it is smooth and fine. Another machine turns this into a dough which is ready to be made into strands.The first step of distinction is here, explains Khan. There is a different machine for strands of different thickness. There are four machines. The most sophisticated one dishes out the finest strands.""This is the premium Lakhnawi Khaas or Banarasi sewain variety,"" says Khan. The other three machines churn out thicker strands that are regular varieties.After the strands are pressed out from machine, they are spread out on the ground ground and carefully put on wooden hangers. It is important to hang these bunches of strands under direct sunlight or on a cloudy day, in a room where the temperature is above 55 degrees Celsius so that they dry completely. The temperature is maintained by igniting wooden blocks and coal every 10 meters on the floor for the moisture to evaporate. The entire process takes more than 10 hours.In the next stage, one batch is kept in a furnace to roast and attain the golden colour that its patrons love and another batch is left white. This is what we know as 'kacchi sewain' and what will be cooked as 'doodhwali sewain'.There are various types of sewain, says Khan's son Salman.""Each variety is prepared according to the demand of sewain lovers and local cuisine. The richest ones are 'sheer korma' and 'qiwami sewain'. The other varieties are bhuni sewain, kacchi sewain and zardey wali sewain.""According to Pappu Bhai, one of the oldest sewain sellers at Akbari Gate, there is a lot that can be done with sewain.""Lucknow has retained its culture of harmony through food. Every year, Muslims serve their Hindu friends sewain with love on Eid. Not only sewain but 'soot pheni' or 'lacche' are also very popular here,"" he says.Similar to sewain, soot pheni is more milky and not as rich as sewain. During Ramzan, it is had for sehri or pre-dawn meal."

The government wants to put restrictions on stock that mills can keep. But there is no demand for sugar and hence mills will find it difficult to sell stocks. I have spoken to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and will also speak to the central government officials to find a way,"" Pawar said at the centenary celebrations of Pune District Cooperative Bank on Friday.Earlier, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan had tweeted ""It has been decided to impose stock limit on sugar stock to be held by sugar mills at the end of September 2016 and October 2016.""The limit at the end of September would be 37 per cent of the total sugar that mills had in the same period a year ago, while for October it would be 24 per cent.In April, the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given its approval to bring sugar under the purview of imposing stock holding limits on dealers of sugar, keeping in view the recent upward trend in sugar prices. The government noticed that in spite of sufficient availability of sugar stocks with the sugar mills, the wholesale and retail prices have shown a spurt.""It is a fact that sugar prices are soaring, but at the same time farmers must also survive,"" Pawar said. He also opposed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decision to fix a 12-month term to repay crop loans.""Sometimes sugarcane takes about 15 months to grow and hence it is inappropriate to ask farmers to pay their crop loans in 12 months,"" he said. Pawar also warned that deliberate efforts to destroy the cooperative movement will affect the common people.BOXPraise for PawarBJP leaders and ministers in the cabinet Girish Bapat and Subhash Deshmukh were present for the function. Both praised Pawar's leadership qualities. Former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the government was targeting cooperative movements while helping private business houses."

Thanks to the sudden rise in the prices of milk and sugar, almost all confectionery shops in the city are mulling a price hike that will come into effect in the coming weeks.""The prices of milk, ghee and sugar the main ingredients for sweet shops  are constantly going up. We've been shouldering the burden for the past few months, but for how long? We can't compromise on quality and size of sweets, as we have a name in the market. Every day, we need around 1,000 of litres of milk, which currently costs `49 a litre. But the price fluctuates, and last month it was `52. We have a contract with suppliers and if we need extra milk, we have to pay the market price, which can be between `60-70. On Poila Boishakh I needed extra milk, which I bought at `140 per litre. We can't continue without a 10-20% increase in the price of our products. Roughly, it means that a sweet that costs `10 now will cost `12,"" said Parikshit Gupta of Gupta Brothers, Salt Lake.SUPPLY LINES DRY UPThe worst part is that the crisis will deepen over the next few months. Reports suggest that sugar prices will go up by `3-4 per kg in the coming days. Cooperative minister Chandrakant Patil suggested that sugar production might fall by up to 50% in the next year as sugarcane crops are being hit because of drought.This steep rise in prices has affected the profit margins of sweet shops. ""The profit margin is as low as 7-8% now. With the falling number of cowsheds and milkmen, the supply lines are drying up. The milk that cost `40-42 per litre in April now costs `50-51. Sugar is `43 per kilo now, while it was `38 only a few months back. Our pre-Puja price hike will see mishti doi going from `200 to `220 per kilo, apart from a commensurate rise in the prices of other sweets,"" said Suprovat Dey, from Naba Krishna GuinSubhrajyoti Choudhury of Deshbandhu Mishtanna Bhandar pointed out that multiple factors like transport costs, presence of middlemen and a skewed demand-supply ratio were affecting the prices of essential commodities. ""Our sweets will see a 10% or more hike in prices,"" he added.CAKE SHOPS FACE THE HEAT TOOIf you thought that only traditional sweet shops are affected, think again. Some of the city's biggest cake shops are also facing the heat. ""We've not announced a price hike, keeping in mind our customers and the competition. But it's coming soon, probably before Durga Puja. The price of cakes should go up by `10 per pound,"" said Lovey Kapur, from Kookie Jar.Confectionaries that sell savouries like pizzas, puffs and patties are finding it difficult to cope since vegetables prices have gone up as well. ""Butter, milk, cheese, sugar, vegetables  everything we need for our products cost more now. We've thought of keeping our customers happy so far, but before Puja, prices will go up by 10-12%,"" said Satyendra Mishra of Cakes. Cupcakes, the firm favourite with the young crowd, will cost more soon, said Sneha Singhi of Paris Cafe. ""A red velvet cupcake that now costs `70 will cost `85. I'm sure our customers will be with us.""EYES ON THE PUJASMost sweet shops affirm that though they are bearing the brunt of the rise in prices of essential commodities so far, once they approach the Pujas, the greater demand will force them to hike prices. Most of them are still going through their books to figure out what is the minimum increase possible that will keep them in the business  yet not drive customers away to competition.""Milk, ghee and sugar are the pillars of our industry and with the prices of these three items going up, we will have to order a 8-10% increase in prices of our food items leading up to Durga Puja. Take the example of milk. Sixty per cent of it we buy on a yearly contract, but the rest of the 40 per cent has to be bought from the local market and that costs a fortune. Consumption of milk is increasing, but with the number of cowsheds falling, this will only send the demand-supply ratio into a tailspin and hence affect all milk and dairy products. And we hear that sugar production is less than last year, so the price will surely increase,"" said Subhajit Ghosh of Banchaaram's.Sudip Mullick from Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick too is thinking of hiking the price of =sweets by 10% before Pujas. ""Milk, which was `35-40 per litre a few months back, is now `50-54 per litre. The price of sugar is also going up. So, there is no option but to increase the price of sweets before Pujas."""

They all owe their bodies to Phil Maffetone , a health and fitness trendsetter from New York , who has handheld them into the MAF Method, his unique approach to slim down, lose body fat, raise energy and ramp up performance.On a whirlwind trip to India, Maffetone spent a quiet morning at MIG Cricket Club in Bandra on Friday after spending a week in Hyderabad and Kochi before heading to Delhi to continue motivating runners, athletes, health professionals and corporates to take appropriate lifestyle actions.""They might quiz me at the immigration,"" he smiled. ""This is my first time in India and I haven't shopped. Oh, except some spices that someone got me."" He also has to his credit dozens of recipes where meatballs, burgers, tacos and shakes are not a forsaken part of the diet.The MAF Method, in the literal sense stands for ""Maximum Aerobic Function"", is one of the most widely practised endurance training in the world that focuses on three key factorseliminating sugar and refined carbs from the diet, fat-burning aerobic exercises and stress management. ""My most important focus is the aerobic system which includes the heart, lungs, blood vessels and muscle fibres. The idea is to burn fat which when stored offers inefficient, short-term energy. This allows runners to 'slowly' win the race,"" explained Maffetone, who also devised the 180 Formula to monitor heart rate, a direct reflection of the body's oxygen need, during aerobic training.In between his India tour, a look at the public health website caught Maffetone's concern. ""It seems instead of coconut oil or ghee, people eat vegetable oil? That's the worst thing you can do to the body.""Though impressed by the control of tobacco in India, the researcher-author-educator pointed out the new bad habit that is turning out to be equally hazardous is consumption of sugar, white flour and processed food. ""It is surprising how in one generation people have gone from starvation to obesity,"" he said. ""The number of obese people in the world is 700 million. Add to that overweight people who aren't obese; that's 2.9 billion. Plus, those who are old and have too much fat around their organs and bones. That's 5.5 billion people. It means 75% of the world is over fat and that nutrition transition is happening in India. It's changing the body's genes,"" Maffetone said, reasoning why East Africans' stranglehold in distance running is gradually loosening. ""It was evident at this year's Olympics that saw few Top 10 finishes.""Indian athletes, he said, have good fitness levels, but not necessarily health levels, as he makes a clear distinction between the two and the need for both. ""This is a paradox. That's why a lot of people running marathons are fat and get injured quite easily. The extreme of that are athletes who die in the middle of a race,"" he explained. ""I'm happy to see so many people in India running marathons because most of them were couch potatoes before that. Now, they have to take the next step forward and turn healthy.""Now 64, with a thatch of milky white hair touching his ears, Maffetone reminisced about his own journey from unhealthy to healthy to developing a passion to help others after an epiphany as a teenager standing in the school cafeteria with a tray full of ""junk"".The other big realization happened 12 years ago when he woke up to his other sidea songwriter. Maffetone spent several years in Los Angeles doling out a blend of pop, folk and rock over six albums. That's also when he met music stars Ri-ck Rubin and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers who he helped defy the wild and wayward tag and got Johnny Cash off his wheelchair. ""Doing a performance for two hours, five days a week is like running a marathon and they all realized they'd be more creative if they're healthy."""

Be it the fusion of cuisines or quirky twists to age-old recipes, Puneites are always eager on trying new things. The latest trend that has caught on is that of granola variations. Now, granola as a whole is something we have been having for a while. However, city foodies are now opting for granola pizzas and desserts. Pune Times speaks to city bakers and foodies on the rising trend of granola variations.Granola is generally made up of rolled oats, nuts, honey or other sweeteners and baked until it is crisp, toasted and golden brown. Namrataa Kripallani, a city baker and owner of owner of a bakery-confectionery offers granola bars made from 100% rolled oats with no added sugar, preservatives. ""We only use pure honey to sweeten our granola products.We have variations like date and almond, mixed berries, dark chocolate and pecan nuts. We have also made granola muffins which give a crunchy twist to your dessert. Granola is a healthy alternative to mindless snacking,"" shares Namrataa. On the health benefits of the product, she adds, ""It is high in fibre and the oat content helps to maintain sugar levels. We also experiment with mousse-based desserts that have layered granola crunches.""Like muffins and cupcakes, granola is also used as a pizza topping. Pastry chef, Pallak Doshi says, ""We experimented with a granola pizza, where the base was made of rolled oats, granola was used as topping with a lot of fresh fruit. It is a healthy option for breakfast or day-time snacking."" What prompted her to make this dish? Pallak adds, ""People often associate healthy with boring. So, we are looking at promoting health in a quirky way. A healthy pizza does grab eyeballs.""Also watch:Anuradha Sawhney, who runs a pure vegan food service in the city makes her own variant of granola with a lot of nuts and raisins. She replaces honey with pure maple syrup. ""Granola is super healthy. It can be made at home and stored for about two weeks. The nutritional value needs to be maintained, which may go for a toss if you include too much sweeteners,"" adds Anuradha. Awanti Warde, owner of a bakery cum confectionery rolls put granola-based cereals. She suggests, ""When needs to be very careful with the sugar content in granola. A granola crumble can be combined with just about any dessert. It does make for a lip-smacking dish. A granola muffin is an interesting variant too."""

""They also threatened me with dire consequences if I resisted. Thereafter, they snatched my cellphone and made a call to my father around 9.30pm, demanding a ransom of Rs 3 crore,"" he said.""On receiving the call, my father was so panicked that he could not react to the situation. He took some time to tell the kidnappers that it was beyond his capacity to pay the amount at such a short notice. He, however, promised to pay them Rs 10 lakh which he had at the moment,"" Ankit said, adding that the kidnappers allowed him to talk to his father only once.Visibly-emotional Rathi said, ""Ankit's wife was inconsolable after he was kidnapped. The kidnappers made a total of 11 calls in the name of D-gang for the ransom. It became difficult for us to console her, but we did not lose hope and gave informed the crime branch about the incident. I am indebted to the policemen who acted immediately and cracked the case within 10 hours after lodging the complaint.""Assistant commissioner of police Suresh Bhosale said the suspects, identified as Anil Dahire (19), Rohit Sathe (19), Nikhil Kamble (22), Nitin Bendre (21) and Prakash Diwakar (20) from Market Yard and Sahakarnagar, were arrested around 8am on Tuesday. ""The plan to kidnap Ankit was hatched by Narayan Vallabh Vaishnav (28), an accountant of Rathi, who has been arrested too. However, one of his accomplices, identified as Arjun Sopan, is still at large,"" he said.After Rathi approached us with the complaint, we asked him to agree to their demands and ask them the meeting point. ""To confuse police, the kidnappers kept changing their location. We had to lay traps at many spots, including Khadi Machine Chowk in Kondhwa, Saswad, Shindewadi, Wagholi, Kesnand Phata, Theur, Solapur Road, Urali Kanchan,"" Bhosale said.Finally, our teams from the anti-extortion cell led by senior inspector Anil Patil and crime branch (Unit V) and inspector M M Mujawar spotted Ankit and the kidnappers in a car parked in a suspicious manner in Yavat.

The suspects, barring Vaishnav, are into small time jobs, police said.DCP P R Patil said investigations have revealed that since Vaishnav worked in Rathi's office for two years, he was well aware of the daily transactions made by them. ""Vaishnav and his accomplices planned the kidnapping to make easy money. It took them eight days to come up with the plan, for which they stole a car belonging to one Shashikant Keshav Bhide.Patil said during interrogation, Vaishnav also revealed that he had taken the help of some of the suspects earlier too to rob Ankit. ""They robbed Ankit of Rs 6.5 lakh cash in Hadapsar on May 5, 2016,"" he said. However, the case remained undetected since then.Ankit's uncle Rajendra Gugale said, ""We were confused whether to approach police or not. We consulted retired CID chief Ashok Dhiware and registered a complaint after he told us to have faith in the police force. We thank police for detecting the case within 10 hours after giving them information of the incident.""A police team comprising assistant inspectors Mahadev Waghmode, Vitthal Shelar and Yuvraj Nandre and policemen Amjad Pathan, Nilesh Desai, Sachin Ahiwale and others will be rewarded for detecting the case.
