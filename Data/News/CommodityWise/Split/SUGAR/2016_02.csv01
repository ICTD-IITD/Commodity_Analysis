Farmers alse raised delay in payment for sugarcane they supplied to mills last season.Punjab Dialogue head Kanwar Sandhu said the party brainstormed with legal expert H S Phoolka to finalise a policy for recovery of agriculture loan on the pattern of the one formulated by Sir Chhotu Ram before Independence. The idea is to do away with forcible recovery of loan, he said.AAP farmers' wing head GS Kang said once voted to power, the party would set up soil testing laboratories in each district so that farmers could be guided to cultivate the crop for which their soil is most suitable. ""It is the first time that the Narendra Modi government has made a direct subsidy to sugar mills, instead paying it farmers, resulting in flourishing of private sugar mills and poor plight of farmers,"" Sandhu said, adding that while government sugar mills are on the verge of closure, private mills are mushrooming. tnn"

The new reprimand for gaining the pounds comes straight from the government and it may hurt the pockets, too! In Kerala, the State Budget on Friday has proposed a 14.5 per cent tax on "" junk food such as pizzas, burgers and doughnuts sold in upscale restaurants"" in a bid to counter rising obesity . It has become the first state in the country to impose such a ""fat tax"", that is already levied in a few countries like European countries like Hungary and Denmark already levy. If Mumbai goes the Kerala way, will we see a fat tax working here, too?This is an idea that could work well back home, believes dietician and sports nutritionist Deepshikha Agarwal. She says, ""Obesity is at an all-time high in Mumbai and it's alarming. I have kids at 10 years dealing with diabetes and high obesity-related issues. This comes down to poor eating habits. Fries, burgers and quiches are now becoming more of a convenient option and they are being consumed for lunch and breakfast, too! With life being so fast-paced, people are on the run and tend to take their nutrition for granted. The idea is, 'let me order a takeaway of fast food as I can eat lunch on the go', but that is not ideal. I hear people make excuses for this, which is a huge mistake. I often hear folks say they balance it out by doing gym for an hour after eating these foods, but that's not enough. They also say, 'I'll have green tea after indulging', but green tea is no counter to junk food. So yes, this tax is a great idea. If the money pinches, it may lead to a decrease in the intake  consumption may come down from four times a week to twice and lower health risks."" Preserved foods must be included in such a tax bracket too, she adds. ""It's high time this tax is levied in Mumbai and not just for junk food but preserved foods, which can be deadly. They are rich in sodium chloride, can cause blood pressure problems, dryness in the eyes, sluggishness and hormonal imbalance, if consumed long-term.""It's not only fast food, let's not forget that high-fat snacks and street fast food can be as bad, warns clinical dietician, Zainab Gulamhusein. ""Why just burgers and fries, Indian food is also laden with empty calories, which give no concrete nutrition  take for instance vada pao or bhajiyas, butter chicken, dal makhni or paneer makhni or even ras malai, barfi and other Indian sweets. So really speaking, the fat tax should cover a lot of foods. What is also scary is that several food preparations entail the use of colour, additives and chemicals beyond the permissible level, which could be carcinogenic in the long run.""And if you're thinking you can eat heavy food as long as it's made at home, think again. ""Even ghar ka khana must be about the right kind of dishes. If you regularly eat deep-fried ragda pattice or homemade sev puri, these have a high oil content. Diet bhel and chiwda too, have excessive salt and sugar , which people don't know about, so let's not forget all of that. Bottom line is, why wait for a tax? Why not just be aware and make the right food choices on an everyday basis?"" she asks.Just levying a tax may not deter people from putting on weight. While exercise and home-cooked food play key roles, incentivising the issue may really swing things around, feels strength coach, Jivesh Shetty. ""Abroad they have weighing scales at train stations, where you have to pay according to your body weight as this signifies how much surface area you will occupy. We could start that here, even in office cafeterias, with a 'pay less if you weigh less' approach. Spas and gyms could also offer discounts based on body weight. There can be a whole lot of such incentives for Mumbai. Taxing big eateries may just affect a small percentage of the population in the city. Instead let's use these creative incentives to get people to lose weight and put them on the road to wellness,"" he suggests.Last year, the Turkish governor derived a novel way of tackling the issue by imposing a ban on using lifts to reach the first three floors of public buildings.In Japan, it's illegal to be fat. The country came come up with legal tactics to maintain the country's obesity rate. As per The Metabo Law, it mandates a waistline of 35.4 inches for adult women and 33.5 inches for men aged 40-74.Dubai once came up with a financial incentive to lose weight where participants who shed two or more kilograms by the Eid date at the end of Ramadan would get the equivalent number of grams in gold.As per a report in October 2014, obese people in the UK would be 'paid' to lose the flab. Slimmers with jobs were given cash or shopping vouchers under new NHS plans, if they have a job.The Pacific archipelago called 'one of the fattest nations on earth' has taxed sugary drinks since 1984. Next year Britain may levy a tax on soft drinks with more than 5 mg of sugar per 100 millilitres, to contain childhood obesity. Next year Britain may levy a tax on soft drinks with more than 5 mg of sugar per 100 millilitres, to contain childhood obesity.Australia once implemented a 10 per cent tax on soda, candy and white flour bakery products."

Togadia launched Go-Toback and Go-Alcox medicines - for de-addiction of tobacco and alcohol respectively - and even sugar testing sticks at as low as Rs 8 for patients who come to IHL. ""I have kept my stethoscope locked up for quite a long period, but it is time to take it out and work for the welfare of the country because India is a country full of patients and not healthy people,"" said Togadia at Indian Medical Association (IMA) hall on Sunday. Detailing about the medicines Togadia launched on Sunday, he said, ""If 15 drops of Go-Toback are consumed every day, it will stop the urge to have tobacco-related products immediately. Similarly, if Go-Alcox is consumed every day by mixing in food - which in most of the cases will have to be mixed by the family members of alcoholics - it will stop addiction to alcohol gradually.""Togadia also said that these medicines will be available with IHL ambassadors. He also launched a sugar testing stick - which will be available at Rs 8 in comparison with other sticks available in the market for Rs 26. The VHP leader, known for his fiery pro-Hindu speeches, preferred to avoid political questions and said, ""I don't want to talk about a particular issue or person. My main focus today is nearly 30 crore Indians who are ill.At present, out of every three Indians, one is a patient but that day is not far when out of every two Indians, one will be a patient."""

The figure is on a par with almost 60% of the state's public health outlay for thisyear.Among those who owe money are both private mills and cooperative sugar factories controlled by the state's sugar baron politicians, including former ministers and even a former chief minister.Yet Maharashtra has among the least arrears compared to other sugar-producing states like Uttar Pradesh, where cane dues are becoming an election issue. In fact, sugar factories in Maharashtra paid almost 96% of their dues by June 15 when the data was compiled (see list in box).The main problem factories faced was the record-breaking sugar production last year and a steep drop in both international and domestic prices. Factories found it difficult to pay the cane price set by the Union government that was higher than the price at which sugar was selling. This year, sugar prices have improved.""Maharashtra has the least arrears among the sugar-producing states. Last year there was a problem because of the glut in production and crash in sugar prices. This year, conditions have improved,"" said state sugar commissioner Vipul Sharma. Last year, the price of sugar had dropped to Rs 1,800 per quintal while cane prices were set at over Rs 2,500. This year, the price of sugar is much higher at over Rs 3,000 a quintal.Most factories say their arrears will be cleared by Diwali, which has traditionally been the last instalment for payments. ""The bulk of our arrears are old dues. In fact, we have paid even more by now but the information has to be updated,"" said Vishal Patil from the Vasantdada sugar factory in Sangli. The Chopada sugar factory in Jalgaon, whose licence has been suspended, says the previous management and lack of loans from banks is responsible for their arrears.""The arrears cannot be looked at as an absolute sum. The fact is that in most cases, including my factories, more than 90% of the dues have been paid. That's what the government wanted and we have met the demand,"" said former CM Ashok Chavan. He said the government needs to change its method of fixing cane price. ""They fix the cane price on last year's sugar prices. If sugar prices crash, how can we pay the cane price?"" he asked.Sugar factories in the state are counting on a Rs 45 per ton subsidy announced by the Centre to finally clear dues. ""Sugar prices rose in February. By then 40% of the sugar stock had been sold at a lower price. So factories could not capitalize on the price rise,"" pointed out Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. ""Only 20 mills have paid less than 90% of their dues,"" he pointed out.However, farm activist Raju Shetti from the Swabhimani Paksh, an ally of the BJP-Shiv Sena government, said he will continue to agitate over arrears. ""In some cases, factories do not pay the cane prices because of debts and mismanagement. The position in Maharashtra has improved but we have to keep the pressure on,"" he said."

Amudha Lakshmi, principal, Chettinad Vidyashram School. However, she added: we have no control on what the students purchase from the shops around the campus. But, we are sensitising them to the dangers of consuming junk food, said S. Amudha Lakshmi, principal, Chettinad Vidyashram School.Lakshmi Srinivasan, principal of P.S. Senior Secondary School, said that while their canteen did not stock up on junk food, the faculty has been asked to speak to parents and students about right eating habits whenever necessary.Teachers who look after primary classes, in particular, have been asked to observe what the students bring to school and speak to their parents if they bring junk food, she said.The SBOA School and Junior College in the city underwent a change with regard to their canteen, two years ago, after the school correspondent Thomas Franco Rajendra Dev and Management decided to stop the sale of junk food and bakery items on the campus.We now have people who come and cook healthy food on the campus and the menu includes options such as Ragi puttu and sundal varieties as well as fresh juices and buttermilk, said the school Principal Radhika Unni.List of foodsThe circular is based on a report prepared by a working group constituted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) on the consumption of foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar (HFSS) and the promotion of healthy snacks in schools across the country.The circular, which states that the consumption of HFSS foods could lead to childhood obesity and a number of diseases, also points out that it affects the cognitive and physical development of children.Consumption of food high in fat, salt and sugar can affect cognitive and physical development"

It's hardly possible to meet a Goan who will not swear by his coconut-based fish curryan essential daily meal componentor a boiled vegetable garnished with freshly grated coconut. The beauty of both, the coconut palm and its fruit, lies in their versatility.It is no secret that the coconut is used extensively in Goan cuisine. Even when it comes to desserts, the coconut, be it in its whole form or as a milk, forms the basis of a host of traditional favourites including bebinca, batica, dodol, bolinhas and others. It has also gained popularity as a vital ingredient in several continental desserts such as tender coconut mousse or ice-cream.One among the amazing range of Goan desserts that pays homage to the coconut rather magnificently, is the letri. A local speciality that finds its origins in Portuguese cuisine, the difference is that while the Portuguese version uses angel hair pasta, the Goan version has cleverly been adapted to star the coconut. While one may not really be able to pick a letri off the shelves as it is mostly made to order, it has, however, secured its position as a prized Goan sweet.Vasco-based home baker Melissa Martins undertakes letri orders using a recipe that's been handed down several generations of her family. ""The letri is considered to be a speciality, more so because it is not easily available over the counter, like other popular Goan sweets,"" she explains. Ask her what the most important factor is to ensure a succulent and tasty letri and she pegs it on using the right type of coconut. ""It must neither be too tender nor too mature,"" she says.The other vital components of the dish are shredded, fresh bread or egg whites, sugar, ghee or butter, and flavourings such as vanilla or almond essence, and rose water. Dried fruits like raisins, cashew nuts and almonds may be added to give the dish a hint of crunch.One element that is naturally associated with letri is the sunshine yellow, intricate lace-like lattice decoration with highlights of sugar cherries or silver dragees that top the dessert. ""Also known as fios de ovos, this is quite simply angel hair made using egg yolk that are drawn into thin strands and boiled in sugar syrup,"" says noted Goan cookbook author Ivo Coutinho of 'A Day In The Goan Kitchen' fame.He elaborates on how cooking methods of the letri also differ in Goa's districts. ""In North Goa, bread is used as a binding element, while in South Goa, we use egg whites,"" he says."

""While conducting a socio-anthropological project to study the food habits of Dalits in UP, commissioned by the University of Pennsylvania, I discovered that poor Dalit settlements had an unusually large number people in their nineties,"" said Dalit columnist turned entrepreneur Chandra Bhan Prasad. ""In comparison, the longevity in Thakur 'bastis' was relatively low.""Prasad is planning to use his indigenous wisdom to launch an online startup called Dalit Foods that will peddle food products sourced from Dalit farmers including spices and millets. Disseminating information on authentic Dalit cuisine will also be a big part of the company, which is expected to be launched later this month.Physical labour -- toiling 910 hours in the farming fields under the sun - is welded into the lifestyle of millions of Dalits. Prasad felt food could be one of the reasons behind their high life expectancy. ""Traditionally, Dalits didn't have large tracts of land. They mainly grew crops such as millets that don't require much water. Millets are good for health. They didn't have money to use chemical fertilizers, which meant organic food,"" said Prasad. ""Dalits ate rotis along with wheat husks.

Now, the west is telling us that authentic Indian cuisine is the best and we are going back to it in a big way."" Dalit cuisine is essentially full of whole grains, which means a high amount of fibre, nutrients and antioxidants, said Makhija. ""Other than the rich organic nature of the food, the ingredients make digestion harder in a good way, allowing blood sugar levels to remain stable.""Prasad, who has been working on the project for two years, has set aside a modest capital of Rs 5 lakh.

We will start selling online and scale up once demand intensifies,""he said.He is sourcing raw materials from across the country where agriculture is done in old fashioned Dalit way, meaning no chemical fertilisers and less water."

They break their game only when visitors enter the courtyard to greetings of 'As-salamu alaykum'.There are 45 students in this madrassa and the evening game is part of their curriculum which is centred around memorizing the Koran. Beneath the daily grind of the madrassa, however, are buried more than 100 years of history. The madrassa is part of the legends surrounding this Muslim-dominated town which has thrived on the perfume trade.Any mention of Hojai's perfumes would be incomplete without reference to the legendary Haji Ajmal Ali and his five sons. Four of them, including perfume baron and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) chief Badruddin Ajmal, were born in the madrassa itself. The fifth was born in Mumbai.The Ajmals' connection with the madrassa doesn't end here. At one corner of its courtyard is a tiny, tin-roofed hut where Ajmal Ali first started his perfume distillery in the 1950s. From this humble beginning, the entrepreneur, and later his sons, would go on to float the Ajmal Group of Companies in over 10 countries.It's no surprise then that the Ajmal family continues to inspire respect and awe among residents of Hojai, and those of Alinagar in particular. Tales of the Ajmals' philanthropy abound and have achieved the status of myths. ""They are very naek (righteous people). Their names inspire respect,"" says 60-year-old Haji Abul Kalam, who introduces himself as the Ajmals' neighbour.The third of Ajmal Ali's sons, Badruddin, 66, is no longer in the family business, but concentrates solely on running and expanding AIUDF and a host of charitable and education trusts established by the family.Since the birth of AIUDF in 2005, Badruddin's party has showed Assam's 34.22% Muslim population a political alternative to Congress. The party has significant presence in Muslim-dominated constituencies which were hitherto Congress strongholds. An MP from Dhubri Lok Sabha constituency, he won 10 seats in 2006 and 18 in the 2011 assembly elections. In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, he won three seats.A Fazil-e-Deoband (which is equivalent to a master's degree in Islamic theology and Arabic) from Darul Uloom Deoband, Badruddin juggles politics and social work deftly. ""Charity is inherent in the Ajmal family. Badruddin bhai's grandfather used to look out for people,"" says Faizul Haque, Badruddin's schoolmate in Hojai.A member of the shura (advisory board) of Darul Uloom Deoband, Badruddin's image as a maulana helps him garner support, especially among Bengali-speaking Muslims who form the bulk of the state's Muslim population. Badruddin, too, works the combination to his advantage, delivering slogans and duwas (blessings) at his rallies. Villagers lining up with water-filled bottles for his duwas is a common sight at AIUDF ralliesBadruddin is a one-man army for AIUDF. From mobilizing resources to leading the election campaign, his is the last word. This election, which will see him contest from South Salmara seat in Dhubri, is no different.After popping pills, mostly for blood sugar and pressure, Badruddin takes a chopper to visit far-flung places in Assam. ""I eat what I get along the way,"" he smiles. ""That's why AIUDF has emerged as a force this polls,"" he adds. ""Every day, I attend six to seven rallies across the state and go to sleep at 3am. I wake up at 5. After Fazr prayer, I sleep for another hour. After that, I start my daily chores,"" says the man behind AIUDF."

However, lack of time and expertise in preparing traditional sweets has been luring Odias to throng special outlets that have cropped up during the festival. These outlets, making a thriving business by serving an array of traditional cakes and sweets, show the demand has increased several times as compared to previous years.According to the official sources, the outlets of the Odisha Tourism Development Corporation (OTDC) had on Monday sold pithas worth Rs 70,000 while the sales crossed Rs 2.19 lakh on Tuesday. ""This year the demand of pithas has gone up several times than the last year. We were forced to close the outlets for some time so that our chefs get time to prepare. We are selling three to four quintals of pithas every day. Apart from counter sales, we got a large quantity order for pithas of all varieties,"" said OTDC marketing executive, Alok Mishra.At least 20 varieties of traditional pithas are available in the shops, including the popular podapitha - a special Odia delicacy made during the festival - and arisa, kakara, manda, chhena puli, sara puli, chhena poda, karanji, patali pitha, saru chakuli, haladipatra pitha, chhunchi patra pitha and so on. Poda pitha comes with a price tag of Rs 200 to Rs 400 per kg..""The preparation of poda pitha takes a lot of time, effort and expertise. First, rice has to be soaked for a few hours then powdered. Then, dough is prepared by adding the rice powder with coconut, dry foods, cheese, sugar or jaggery and finally it is baked in an oven or a pressure cooker. In rural households it is still baked in earthen chulhas (charcoal stoves) covered in banana leaves. With most women working these days and many of them not aware of the proper process of making the pitha, people prefer to buy it,"" said Bimbadhar Behera, owner of Nimapada Sweets, a popular traditional sweet-shop in the city.Many big hotels and restaurants have also been cashing in on the Raja craze and organized special food festivals to serve traditional Odia food."

According to official sources, Sonepat district alone sends out around 500 quintals of mushrooms to Delhi every day and accounts for nearly 20% of the share of Delhi's market.With climatic conditions in Haryana mirroring western UP, officials say that farmers here are missing out on a huge untapped opportunity even as the sugar industry has been in turbulence. According to the official figures, there is not a single mushroom farmer in Meerut district even though the crop promises good returns.""Other states like Haryana and Himachal Pradesh are leaders in mushroom production in north India. Some districts, such as Solan in Himachal Pradesh and Sonepat in Haryana, have become hubs. Of the total mushrooms sold in Delhi's markets, 20% come from Sonepat alone. It is unfortunate that even though the conditions in western UP are the same as those in Haryana, farmers here have not explored the potential of mushroom cultivation. In Meerut district, we have no records of anyone cultivating mushrooms,"" said Arun Kumar, Meerut district horticulture officer. He added, ""The returns on mushroom cultivation are very high. On average, farmers can make double of what they invest.""Harpal Singh, a Saharanpur-based farmer, testified to Kumar's claims. ""I started growing mushrooms in 2008 and I have not regretted the decision. I belong to a family that has traditionally grown sugarcane. At first, I thought it would affect cane cultivation. However, growing mushrooms requires no land per se. All I need is a dark, moist room and I can easily grow mushrooms. On average, it costs about Rs 40 to grow 1 kg of mushrooms. It sells in the market for Rs 80-85. Sometimes, the price can even go up to Rs 110 per kg.""There are several reasons, Kumar said, behind UP farmers' reluctance to grow mushrooms. ""Cultivating sugarcane is easier. You just have to plant the cane and water it. Then you can sit back and relax. Horticulture, on the other hand, requires a little more hard work. With mushrooms, you have to ensure that the room has no sunlight and a certain level of moisture. You need to maintain at least 30% humidity in the room. However, with the sugar industry facing problems, horticulture is a more feasible option. It can give you a regular income,"" he said.Singh said the blame also lies with the lack of infrastructure. ""One of the reasons mushroom cultivation in Sonepat is booming is its proximity to Delhi. It will take only two hours to reach Delhi from there but from Saharanpur, it will take six hours,"" he added.Meanwhile, the state government has plans to promote mushroom cultivation. ""We will hold meetings with farmers and encourage them to take up mushroom cultivation. The state government is also going to give set up a subsidy regime for this."""

Lucknow division of Northern Railways has floated a tender to outsource the job of shooing away rats from the station. The bids have come from four agencies and the one that quotes the minimum price will bag the one-year contract.It's after three years that a tender for rat control has been floated. ""It will be done as and when need arises,"" said senior divisional commercial manager (DCM), NR, Lucknow, Ajit Kumar Sinha.To keep the contract running, however, the chosen agency would need to have its performance assessed based on number of rats it shows dead in a day or a week. The agency might just present the tail as proof .It is the same as in the case of banks and insurance companies in which an owner has to show the left ear of a buffalo when insurance is sought for the dead bovine. At Varanasi railway station, where the contract was awarded to a public undertaking in November last year, dead rats are counted each time the payment is made.""The number of dead rats was initially high. Now, it has come down, at times to a single digit in a day,"" said sources. The annual contract worth about Rs 7 lakh is being awarded to keep the station free of rats. ""We don't want to spot even a single rat or else the exercise of outsourcing is futile,"" said sources.The agency will use four types of treatments. It will put zinc phosphate mixed with 'aata', 'chana daal', mustard oil, sugar and rice at all such spots where rats are seen, in the pits, parcel office, platform, canteen and offices at the station so that rats could eat the mixture. Besides, they will install glu-pads, burn 'lobaan' (gum resin) and use aluminium phosphide.Dead rats are given mass burial in a pit in the station premises after being counted and number is noted in the official register.The agency will have to go for the treatment twice a month. ""Problem with Charbagh is that once there is pest control by the NR, the rats move to 'chhoti line' (Junction) station. They have dug a trench all the way between two stations,"" said a station officer.The two stations should undergo the rat control exercise simultaneously.The 2012 contract did not yield results because only 18 to 20 rats were found dead everyday, while rest escaped. Railways, however, did not expect anything less than 500 rats found dead every day.The high expectations are not without reason, said an official. An agency which was given contract before 2012 showed 2,000 dead rats in a day. Were they all from Charbagh station? There is no evidence.Rats have for long been a major nuisance at Charbagh station. Apart from frightened passengers and hygiene concerns, what worries the officials is the fact that huge rats have made deep holes under the railway tracks, threatening safety."

A detailed report of its recovery, calculation based on FRP formula and payment made to farmers was submitted to the state sugar commissionerate, requesting the sugar commissioner to revoke suspension of crushing licence.Officials at the sugar commissionerate confirmed that the suspension has been revoked.When asked about the reason behind revoking the suspension despite delay in payment, a senior officer of the sugar commissioner said, ""The intension was to give a strong message that the government is not going to be lenient with mills which are not following its orders. There has been a precedence for the past 15 years of no sugar facing action from the government for non-payment of sugarcane price. With the change in government, the office has been given more freedom to take action against erring mills.""Similar action has been taken against seven other mills, including a couple of mills from Kolhapur and Sangli districts. The owners of these mills are trying to sell their sugar in the market so that they could make payments to farmers.

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%. The IMD has forecast above-normal rainfall for the June-September monsoon season this year. Rainfall is forecast to be 6% above normal."

It is rich with a vast pool of educated and skilled human talent, with two government universities and one in the private sector offering undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in engineering, medicine and business management.Although Belagavi is regarded as the best among the tier two cities in the State, the pace of progress has not been as expected due to the slow pace of infrastructure developments, which was fundamental to attract large investments.

58f596247be9e01a17c9cf9a,Retail inflation nears 2-year high,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/Retail-inflation-nears-2-year-high/articleshow/52738455.cms,2016-06-14,"New Delhi: Retail inflation accelerated to a near two-year high in May on the back of pricey food items, dashing hopes of any reduction in interest rates cut by the RBI in the months ahead. The RBI had decided against cutting rates in its latest monetary policy review earlier this month, citing rising inflationary pressures particularly from food items.Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 5.8% in May from previous month's 5.5% increase. This was the second consecutive month when retail inflation has inched after remaining well below the central bank's comfort level. Rural inflation rose 6.5%, up from previous months 6.2%, while urban inflation increased to 4.9% from April's 4.7%.The food price index jumped 7.6% in May from April's 6.4% year-on-year increase. The increase was led by a surge in price of pulses and products, which shot up 31.6% in May, while sugar and confectionery prices rose 14% year-on-year. Prices of protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish also firmed up, exerting pressure on overall numbers. Prices of vegetables jumped 10.8% year-on-year in May.Both retail and wholesale price inflation have inched up in recent months on the back of sticky food prices, prompting the central bank to pause its rate cutting cycle. Economists said inflation management could pose challenges in months ahead.""So far, we have been benefiting on the fuel front due to weak global crude prices and on the manufacturing inflation front due to weak domestic demand. Once this comfort begins to recede, which is likely due to the base effect, besides other things, containing inflation around current levels would become even more challenging,"" said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings and Research.""RBI by not cutting rate of interest in second bimonthly review not only read the writing on the wall correctly but also correctly warned about the looming threat due to food inflation,"" he said.Ratings agency Crisil expects the increase in CPI to be transitory as a normal monsoon and proactive steps by the government in food supply management will rein in food inflation this fiscal and expect the central bank to cut rates if inflationary pressures ease.""After keeping its policy rate unchanged at 6.5% on June 7, the Reserve Bank of India is in a wait-and-watch mode, wanting further clarity on monsoon, global crude oil prices, macroeconomic and financial developments. RBI signalled caution on inflation by underscoring an upward bias, while retaining its April forecast. We expect RBI to deliver another rate cut of 25 basis points this fiscal if price pressures cool off,"" Crisil said in a note."

Despite being overweight, the homemaker has refused to go slow on her fast-food consumption. The imposition of a 'fat-tax' on fast-food by the Kerala government has set her thinking. Even though she isn't planning to give up, Debjani has decided to cut down on her consumption to reduce the pocket pinch, in case the tax travels to Kolkata.""The tax is a steep one and should be enough to drive people like me away from junk food. It's time to make a switch to health food, at least partially,"" she said.Doctors in Kolkata hailed the tax, which they termed as a 'good beginning' towards curbing a non-healthy diet. But it needs to be supplemented with measures to popularize health food, they felt. ""Saturated and trans-fat could be deadly if consumed regularly. Saturated fat contains LDL cholesterol which could lead to cardiac ailments and cerebral strokes. Regular consumers of fast food are at risk for they are consuming several times more calories than they need,"" said Debashish Basu , preventive medicine specialist.Experts pointed out that few consuming fast-food engaged in physical activities that could burn out the additional calorie intake. ""Most fast-food consumers have a busy schedule and they prefer it because fast-food is available quickly and easily. They rarely bother to check the calorie count. This additional calorie gets deposited and invariably leads to health hazards,"" said Amitabha Saha , consultant at Ruby General Hospital Diabetes and abdominal fat were the two most common fall-outs of fastfood addiction in Kolkata, pointed out Basu. ""Fat in the abdominal region is the principal trigger for cardio-vascular diseases. It invariably travels to the cardiac arteries and clogs them,"" Basu said.Not just excess calories, fast food also led to unplanned consumption of protein, pointed out Subir Ganguly , oncologist. ""Fast-food is often laden with deep-fried meat and eggs. The trans-fat count rises as the same food is fried again and again. That apart, the preservatives used are also harmful and often carcinogenic. In fact, excess consumption of salt and sugar with fast food is risky as well. A pizza or a burger is often washed down with aerated drinks, which are again a rich source of additional calories,"" said Ganguly Atax on fast food was not enough to discourage consumption, he felt. ""A tax is fine but the government should suggest alternatives through a guideline on healthy food. It should be well-publicized through an organized campaign,"" Ganguly suggested. Basu agreed. ""Most fast-food consumers belong to the affluent class who can afford to pay more. So, we need to wean them away which is not easy,"" he said.Fast-food chains were tight-lipped about the tax or its possible impact. ""We don't have the tax in Kolkata yet, so it would be hypothetical to comment,"" said a KFC official in Kolkata."

""We won't leave the premises till dues of over Rs 800 crore are cleared by mill owners.""Sangvan alleged that unbridled millers were not paying farmers' money on time.""Farmers are reeling under debt and their condition has worsened. Being poverty-stricken, they are unable to send their children to schools. The worst part is that the state government has turned a blind eye towards them,"" added Sangvan.Another RLD leader, Nayab Ali, said, ""Instead of mounting pressure on millers, the government is supporting them.

Most policies and administrative decisions in cooperation sector are still influenced by leaders from western Maharashtra.In a major development last week, eight BJP leaders including MLA Suresh Halwankar, were successfully elected as directors of Sahyadri Cooperative Sugar Factory, which is set to commence sugarcane crushing in a couple of years. With this, BJP has officially made a foray into the sector dominated by the Congress and NCP.Halwankar said, ""Current way of running sugar mills is not very honest. Radhanagari tehsil of Kolhapur produces huge sugarcane, hence we decided to support the Sahyadri Sugar Factory, which will not only crush sugarcane but it will also offer better returns to farmers. The board will soon submit a proposal for financial assistance so that its construction can be started.""The BJP, largely known for its urban presence, was struggling to break the Congress-NCP stronghold over the rural cooperative sector in the region. Though some prominent BJP leaders from Vidarbha and Marathwada have control over cooperative factories, the party had not been able to gain access to the cooperative sugar factories in Kolhapur.Senior BJP leader and minister for public works Chandrakant Patil said, ""The party has some leaders who are active in cooperation movement but mostly in urban cooperative societies such as scheduled urban banks. The reach of these banks was the urban population. We were trying hard to find a foothold in rural area, where controlling a credit society or bank carries a lot of value.""Patil was in touch with senior NCP leader Annasaheb Navane, who in last some years was disappointed with the Sharad Pawar-led party's negligence towards his demand for the Sahyadri Sugar Mills proposal. Patil saw an opportunity in winning over the senior leader, who could secure the BJP an entry into the cooperative sector. Navane was ZP chairman but failed to get all approvals for his party. After his death last year, his son Balasaheb approached BJP leaders for support.Patil held several rounds of discussions to arrive at a conclusion in which Balasaheb decided to appoint eight BJP leaders to be directors of his 21-member factory. It includes MLA Suresh Halvankar, Atul Joshi, Nathaji Patil, Hemant Kolekar, Deepak Shirgaonkar, Dileep Chougule, Popat Durge and Balasaheb Patil.The win of eight BJP leaders is considered significant for the party that has been keen on developing the cooperative sector leadership, which plays a crucial part in state politics.Prakash Pawar, head of department of political science at Shivaji University, Kolhapur said, ""The leaders in freedom fight got natural advantage to become political leader. At village level, they would call the shots and joined the Congress. In last four decades, leaders like Gopinath Munde and Uttamrao Patil contributed to BJP to make it more acceptable. We should not forget that Munde initiated formation of unions of sugarcane harvesters to control their exploitation from sugar mill management, which was chiefly controlled by Congress leaders. Munde subsequently toed the same line and formed his own sugarcane mill in Beed district.""Other BJP such as Nitin Gadkari, Eknath Khadse, Vinod Tawde and Raosaheb Danve followed the same line but all these leaders are from Vidarbha and Marathwada."

The survey was conducted among 200 patients at government hospitals.Presenting the findings, experts said blood donation campaigns should stress that it is a safe practice and there is also a screening programme which rejects ineligible donors.As many as 120 of the 200 participants said that donating blood make them feel low, while some others believed that frequent blood donation can fluctuate blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and a few said blood donation will lead to severe headache and vomiting, study said.While 86 people believed that blood donation is a painful and time-consuming procedure, 72 said it will lower donor body's immunity level and 56 thought frequent donation will make body weak.MARD president Sagar Mundada said, ""The truth is that it takes a day or two to replenish the fluid volume in the body and three months for regeneration of red cells.""Neither blood pressure nor blood sugar levels fluctuate provided the pre-donation values of the donor are normal, he said.One can easily resume his or her normal routine after donating blood, but should drink at least 10-12 glasses of water, including juices, in the first 24 hours following blood donation, and avoid exposure to sun. The donor should also avoid driving for the next two-three hours, smoking for four hours and alcohol for 24 hours, experts said.Donating blood is not painful at all and the entire procedure takes approximately half an hour, the MARD said, adding that a healthy person can donate blood four times a year with a minimum gap of three months. Experts said, ""People on aspirin, antibiotics, anti-hypertensive, steroids, hormones, anticoagulants, those who use inhalers, and pregnant women cannot donate blood."

Reason: they want a better future for their children, away from the sugarcane factories.Somnath Bhosale, a standard II student, loves to study. ""In books, I can only read. But in tabs, I can do much more. I can look up for spellings and listen to the audio of poems. I can do addition and subtraction and know if I am wrong. Even when I go home, I can study and play using the tab,"" said Somnath.The brain behind this is Suryakant Pakhare. A teacher of mathematics, he said, ""A year ago, our block education officer had sent us to Satara district, where constructivism in teaching was adopted successfully. I was inspired by that and wanted to do the same here. So, I choose to teach in Standard I, where I introduced semi-English,"" said Pakhare.The semi-English medium, along with active teaching, was an instant hit among students and their parents. Pakhare said every student in his class could read, write and do basic arithmetic, fulfilling the understanding levels required of a Standard I student.The next challenge before him was introducing tabs for students and asking money for them. ""These are extremely poor people who migrate for six months to sugarcane factories to earn money for the whole year. Even the cheapest tab costs around Rs4,000 and I didn't know how to ask them. But the moment I told them about this, they readily agreed. They trust me and I think that makes it my job to ensure that their children get the best of education,"" said Pakhare.Three meetings were held, one in March last year and the other two in May and June this year. In the March meeting, Pakhare told the parents about introducing semi-English, and in May, he presented his idea for the tab. ""In the meeting itself, I collected Rs 57,000 and by June I had collected Rs 1,06,000. The parents have resolved to make sure their kids don't have to live a hard life like them,"" said Pakhare.In a class of 36 students, only 30 could contribute for tabs. ""The remaining are poorest of the poor and Rs4,000 is a huge amount for them. I was thinking how to get money for the remaining six when I came to know that the tablets cost only Rs 3,600. So, I asked the other parents if I can use the remaining amount to buy tabs for the remaining six students and they agreed. By the next week, they will also get tabs,"" said Pakhare.It was not all that easy for the sugarcane-cutter Vishwanath Bhosale to get money for tablet. ""I work as a labourer at the sugar factory for six months and in the remaining six months I work as a daily wager. But I want my kid to get educated and want him to get a job. I don't want him to do what I do. Hence, I took advance money from my contractor and paid for the tablet,"" said Bhosale.While students love tabs, they still have not replaced books. ""I teach them via books and pencils from 10am to 12.30pm. From 2pm to 4.30pm, I teach them via tab. This makes sure that they get the best of both worlds,"" said Pakhare."

Nearly full after a meal, we've given in to temptation to have an extra bite or three, and ruined any chance of having dessert.But ever had a sweet dish that, if you have more than one serving of it, would make you seriously consider skipping the next meal? Say hello to the blessing-cum-curse that is rabdi. Or, at least the decadent, food coma-inducing version of the sweet at Hattya Maharaj Rabdi Wale at Netaji Square in Kamptee.Set up about 130 years ago by Kaluram Sharma, the establishment got its curious name from his son Hariram, who was said to be a stubborn child. He wouldn't be at peace until his demand (or 'hatt' in Hindi) for a particular thing was met and was, therefore, nicknamed Hattya. He ran the shop for several decades. After Hattya Maharaj's death, his son Rajendra has been running the business.Like all still-surviving pre-Independence food establishments, Hattya Maharaj Rabdi Wale's first marker of popularity was this: ""It was a hit among the British officers and their families.""The fame of the place has not changed over the years. Neither has the recipe. Sharma says only close family members know it fully. But he can tell this much: It takes six litres of cow's milk, boiled on a low flame for an hour, to make a kilogram of rabdi.The method to make it has also essentially remained the same. The Sharmas still have the old coal-fired bhattis (giant stoves) to cook the milk  Rajendra insists that this gives the sweet its smoky notes.The workers use a thin metal wire to skim the thin film that keeps forming over the slow boiling milk and collect it on the side of the giant kadhai. Layer upon layer of the diaphanous deposit forms the lachchas that give the rabdi its unparalleled creaminess. The end product is so thick, you have to use a spoon to have it. That's right, this milk must be eaten.""We only add saffron, cardamom and a little bit of sugar to the rabdi,"" Sharma says, adding that there are a few 'tacts' that he can't reveal. At least 10kg of the rabdi is sold every day. The demand spikes on Sundays. ""If any rabdi is left over, we make a special peda from it,"" Sharma says.Most of the customers are Nagpurians, Sharma says, adding that this prompted the family to start a branch near Nikalas Mandir in Itwari about eight years ago. Sharma's close relatives run another rabdi shop in Kamptee as well.Hattya Maharaj Rabdi Wale has been visited by a few famous personalities. Among them is celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor. ""He came one day some six-seven years ago,"" Sharma says. ""He had some of our sweets and two katoris of rabdi."" Sure enough, a wall displays a photograph of Kapoor draining the last dregs of the rabdi from a disposable cup.It's safe to assume that he skipped dinner that night.(This occasional column looks at some old eateries in the city, when they started and how they have evolved.

One such solution is the ambulatory glucose profiler, which works on a coin-sized sensor, and gives 1,400 readings. ""You stick it on your upper arm for 15 days. The doctor can remove the sensor and pass it through a reader to get the readings and graphs,"" said diabetologist Dr V Mohan. He said technology was changing healthcare, and an example is how a device like Google Glass can give readings by scanning iris.It is not just monitoring, even drug delivery can be non-invasive. Insulin pumps, in existence for about three decades as an alternative to multiple daily injections of insulin, are being improved. ""Monitoring devices can be attached to these pumps to switch them on and off automatically. Prototypes of pumps that can manage high and low blood sugar levels have been developed,"" Dr Mohan said.On Tuesday, a company announced in Chennai an injectible drug that can delay a diabetic's switchover from tablets to insulin shots. Edgard Olaizola, MD, Lilly India, said the drug is the first injectible when a patient is not able to keep the sugar under control with oral medication. ""It has a molecule that mimics the effects of GLP-1, a hormone that helps keep the sugar level normal by helping the body release its insulin,"" he said. India has around 65 million diabetics. A paper published recently in Lancet found that 15.3% of adults with diabetes are from India. The paper, based on data from 751 studies, involving 4.4 million adults from 200 countries, showed that the prevalence of diabetes has increased 80% in women and more than doubled in men in the country."

The revival of the factory, which closed down 2004, also required the farmers to cultivate sugarcane.The board of directors of the factory had held a meeting with farmers from different parts of the district last year on the issue of the revival of the factory. The farmers had favoured its revival. The first phase work of the Varahi Irrigation Project too had been completed.Nearly 2,700 farmers had agreed to cultivate sugarcane. Since the Brahmavar Sugar Factory had been closed for a long time, a feasibility study by experts on its revival was needed. Once the report from the experts was available, further action could be taken, he said.Mr. Sorake said that as there was lot of controversy over the Yettinahole project, the State government had given its nod in principle for the Paschimavahini project, which aimed at constructing vented and check dams against the West-flowing rivers.The Sowkur Lift Irrigation project and the Siddapura Lift Irrigation Project which came under the Varahi Irrigation project too would be constructed. These projects would help meet not just agricultural needs but also drinking water needs.In order to promote fisheries, the government was also giving importance to the construction of Gangolli fisheries harbour at a cost of Rs. 102 crore and the Koderi fisheries harbour at a cost of Rs. 33 crore. It was planning to construct a sea-wall at Marvanthe at a cost of Rs. 94 crore and a sea wall in Udyavara at a cost of Rs. 102 crore.Tourism was being given a major push in the district. Road connectivity was being improved to all tourist spots. As many as 24 road works had been taken up at a cost of Rs. 23 crore in the district.Mr. Sorake along with Pratapchandra Shetty, MLC, Gopal Poojary, MLA, released booklets to mark the completion of three years of the Siddaramaiah government."
58f59c317be9e01a17c9d694,Farmers in arid India share camps with their cattle,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Farmers-in-arid-India-share-camps-with-their-cattle/articleshow/51887956.cms,2016-04-19,"KHILAD: The cattle camp, on a dusty back road lined with thorny babul trees that seem to thrive no matter how weak the rains, is just about impossible to miss.On a recent day, nearly 3,000 impassive animals took shelter from the midday heat under makeshift tents. They munched the 30 pounds or so of hacked-up sugar cane and sorghum stalks they are allotted and lapped up all the water they wanted, a precious gift in this drought-stricken part of the country.After a third consecutive deficient monsoon season, the government of the Beed district has established as a temporary measure 264 of these camps  long a fixture of drought relief efforts in Maharashtra after surveys predicted a shortage of fodder for the animals. But the camps, set up to handle thousands of cattle, have run into an unanticipated problem: The owners of the livestock, who were supposed to drop them off, have instead moved in  cooking utensils, spare cots, water drums and all.The hundreds of farmers packed into the camp do not always enjoy the same comforts as their cattle, which are considered sacred in Hinduism. Slaughtering cows is outlawed in most states, and preserving them is considered essential to avoiding a large-scale catastrophe.The farmers are forced to fend for themselves, cooking their own meals and living in tents surrounded by mounds of fodder, the ground nearby covered with fresh droppings. Nevertheless, they swore they would not return home until the rains came, whenever that might be.""It gets very cold in the winters and in the mornings and evenings,"" said Bhimabai Garje, 65, who moved three months ago from her home in Khilad. ""It's very hot during the day inside the tent. Mosquitoes bite us all night. But we have no choice.""The local authorities are aware of the squalid conditions but say there is not much they can do.""It was not our expectation,"" said Naval Kishore Ram, the senior administrator for the Beed district. ""We run the camp for the animals. If you start providing food for the human beings, the camp will take another form. This will be a camp for human beings. The basic objective will be disturbed.""Last year in Beed, 45 waterless days stretched out grimly in the middle of what was supposed to be its prime rainy season, as drought was widespread in the country. In Marathwada, a region in central Maharashtra that includes Beed and seven other districts, rainfall was 40 percent below the norm.Wells and hand pumps have run dry, and rumors of mass migrations swirl. Politicians clash over how to address the crisis, and experts worry that the emergency relief, including the cattle camps and the tankers that deliver drinking water to villages, will never stem its root causes.The crisis extends well beyond the Beed district. In nearby Latur, the government sent drinking water by train to meet a surging need. Last month, thousands of farmers in Nashik took to the streets to demand, among other things, compensation for lost crops. And on Wednesday, the Bombay High Court banned Indian Premier League cricket matches in the parched state starting in May in the hope of conserving water.Ajay Dandekar, a professor at Shiv Nadar University who has studied the drought, said the conditions in Marathwada had resulted from dual calamities: a chronically arid landscape ravaged further by rising temperatures and El Nino, as well as the diversion of water to western Maharashtra, where most of its industry and thirsty sugar cane crops lie.""The situation is very grave  it's hopeless,"" he said of the arid countryside.Ms. Garje felt the gravity of the situation last winter in Khilad. The cotton and sorghum monsoon crops had failed, and the village well was nearly dry. Tankers brought drinking water, but she worried about her three cattle, three buffalo and an ox that the family had bought, one by one, beginning 25 years ago when crop yields were bountiful.""I saw the cattle of other villages dying,"" she said.So at one January dawn, she and her husband set out for the cattle camp, nearly two miles away, walking across a bridge over a rocky ravine that was once a river, past the sorghum and cotton fields that had yielded so little last year. They foraged for wood to build their tents, and took dried cow dung from the neighbors for their roofs.She now cooks vegetables over an open fire, and returns home twice a month to check in on her son who looks over their fields. But she does not contemplate going back for good.""I love my cattle more than my children,"" she said. ""I want to stay with them. The life of a farmer all depends on cattle.""It is a sentiment echoed by many residents of the camp, mostly men who have shifted with their animals and are visited occasionally by their small children and wives.Babasaheb Garje, 30, also of Khilad but no immediate relation to Bhimabai Garje, said that at the camp, at least, there was drinking water. His wife comes in the morning, helping him feed their cows and bringing food from home, then leaves in the evening.""After she goes, I sit and think what will happen to the animals,"" he said. ""I think about the rainfall and whether it will come this year.""Not all cattle camps are bare-bones: A sprawling establishment in the Beed district village of Palwan supplies meals for the farmers staying there and is trying to address one symptom of their distress  their inability to pay for their children's weddings. The camp organizers are planning a joint marriage ceremony this month for 50 couples of drought-affected farmers, including 14 couples whose families stay in the camp.The program is being financed by the nongovernmental organization that runs the camp. Rajendra Maske, its secretary, is also a member of the Shiv Sangram Party, which stood for state elections with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Camp residents say the government has awarded the contracts for many of the camps to NGOs run by political workers.In a starched cotton shirt and crisp trousers, Maske surveyed the camp with evident satisfaction. He said he hoped the chief minister would come for the marriage ceremony and that at $30,000 for the whole affair, the NGO was sparing no expense.""People have an emotional connection to the camp,"" Maske said.In February, with some postmonsoon crops showing promise, Ram, the Beed administrative official, recommended closing the camps ""for a month or two."" The government agreed, but the outcry from farmers and politicians was swift, and officials relented.Sanjay Malani, the executive editor of a small daily newspaper in Beed, said that the government was caving to political pressure and that the camps were being used as vote banks for political parties.""It's a moneymaking and image-making business,"" Malani said.The relative lavishness of the Palwan camp is atypical, however. The Khalid camp, which is run by the NGO of Vijay Golhar, a BJP member and a former member of the district assembly, appeared more austere.""My father has always been working for the betterment and development of the farmers,"" said his daughter, Ratnaprabha Golhar. She said that the NGO was providing for all the farmers' needs and that any critique of the camp might have come from ""some opposition.""But Suresh Wanve, 34, who tends 20 cows and buffalo with his brother at the camp in Khilad, said he would prefer that farmers receive the money the government is spending on the animals' fodder in cash, so they could buy fodder themselves and stay in their homes.Still, he felt compelled to stay with the animals, whom he likened to the goddess Lakshmi, or the Hindu goddess of wealth. He worries about thieves now that his wife stays alone with their children.""We know all these things,"" he said, ""but we don't have any other options.""Suhasini Raj contributed reporting from New Delhi."

Congress can never make a villager happy. Its leaders support those who shout anti-national slogans and are bent upon breaking the nation. Let Rahul Gandhi support those who shout such slogans at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), but BJP would never tolerate this. We are never ashamed to say that Veer Savarkar belongs to us.""Flaying Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for his churlish comments on defence and foreign policies of the country, the BJP president said the NDA government has implemented the one-rank-one-pension for defence personnel and a new crop insurance scheme for farmers. Shah said farmers are central to his party's development agenda. He also referred to the prevailing peace in the BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and expressed confidence that the party will retain power in the state after the assembly elections in 2017.Chief minister Anandiben Patel and Gujarat Pradesh BJP president Vijay Rupani also attended the rally. Anandiben in her speech talked about the efforts that her government had taken to revive Vyara sugar factory. However, she did not make any mention about the income tax notices that have been issued to the sugarcane factories.The chief minister also talked about free cancer treatment for women and allocation of Rs 10,000 crore by the state government for the construction of roads and overbridges in rural areas. While mentioning about Bhadbhut barrage scheme on Narmada River, Anandiben Patel announced an allocation of Rs 50 crore by the state government for construction of check dams and ponds in the tribal belt from Ambaji to Umragam."

Ramamoorthy, the protesting cadre said that people who voted for the BJP government felt cheated because the promised jobs were not coming. Instead, prices of essential commodities had increased and there was no sign of the government retrieving black money. By presenting fudged statistics to the people, the BJP government tried to deceive the people. The Tamil Nadu government was no different.At the time of the 2014 Parliamentary election, the BJP promised that if it were to be voted to power it would control prices. But today, the prices had skyrocketed. Tur dal that sold at Rs. 70 a kg two years ago was now priced at Rs. 240 a kg, a kg of tomato had touched Rs. 100 now and in the last three months vegetable prices had increased 120 per cent. The price of sugar had tripled and all this led to the common man shelling more money out of his pocket.The BJP claimed that Prime Ministers foreign visits brought foreign direct investment into the country and that it led to job creation. But the reality was very different. Young people were either unemployed or underemployed. Plus the jobs that were being created were not permanent. Most of those were temporary or contractual in nature.The CPM cadre also said that the jobs in labour-intensive sectors like textile, spinning mills, leather, transport, etc. had fallen."

According to World Health Organisation (WHO), this number is likely to double within 20 years. In India, nearly 10 per cent of the general population is a victim of this disease and 65 million people are currently living with it. This silent killer is diabetes.World Health Day marks the foundation day of WHO and is observed to create global health awareness and highlight major health issues every year. Quite aptly, for World Health Day 2016 (April 7), WHO has picked up the theme 'Beat diabetes, scale up prevention, strengthen care and enhance surveillance'.Already South Asians, especially Indians, are genetically predisposed to diabetes. If worldwide males above 36 and females above 34 are at high risk of diabetes, in India, the age is lower at 34 for males and 32 for females. On top of it, faulty dietary habits and lifestyle are escalating the risk manifold and even the rural population, owing to mechanised farming-induced sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy food habits are equalling their urban counterparts in lifestyle diseases. Around 90 per cent of diabetic cases are non-insulin based or Type 2 Diabetes.Another problem is the fact that diabetics is also mostly asymptomatic. Dr Y Meghanath, general physician and diabetologist from Care Hospital, Visakhapatnam, averred, ""Around 30 per cent of the patients above the age of 45-50 are found to be diabetic. Mostly, the younger lot, in their mid-30s are being affected with very high sugar level, which eventually damage the other organs too and this is detected while testing for some other ailments as the disease is mostly asymptomatic and hence called a silent killer.""Doctors blame escalation of this non-communicable disease on faulty food habits and sedentary lifestyle. Preservatives, chemical fertilisers in the food and pollutants are also environmental factors associated with increase in lifestyle diseases like diabetes. ""With growth in the fast food market, people are filling themselves with 'hollow calories' or junk food whenever they are hungry as these food just fill the stomach but don't add any nutrition to the body. Indirectly, smoking and drinking enhance the complications of diabetes,"" added Dr Meghanath.While the government needs to take the initiative of early annual screening (through random sugar test) right from the age of 30, the best method to detect the disease even in pregnant women is Glucose Tolerance test (GT test). For GT test, one is supposed to consume about 75 grams of glucose and get the blood sugar level checked after two hours of consumption. Non-diabetes would show normal glucose level while the level would shoot up in case of diabetes and borderline diabetics. Medication can be administered to the diabetics while for the borderline cases, life style restriction and dietary modifications for three-six months are prescribed before conducting the second test.Also, even if diabetes can't be completely prevented, its onset can be delayed by about a decade in people who are genetically prone to develop it. Dr KAV Subrahmanyam, head of the department of endocrinology at King George Hospital (KGH), said, ""Even delaying the onset of diabetes has tremendous impact on morbidity, health and economy of the patient. Instead of in the 40s, if the patient gets diabetes in his 50s, it will reduce the risk of subsidiary complications such as heart, kidneys, eyes and so on. This delay can be achieved through lifestyle and dietary modification.""Pointing out that diabetes is increasing in rural areas and among the younger age group (people in their 30s and 40s), Dr Geeta Prasadini, additional director, medical, health and family welfare, AP said new 104 mobile medical units (MMU) will be shortly inaugurated. ""These will concentrate on early detection and screening of non-communicable lifestyle diseases like diabetes. Besides, starting from April 7 for about a week, house to house survey for new and hidden cases and blood sugar test would be done to generate awareness and identify new cases,"" she said."

Moreover, the city airport lacks a radioactive material shed, hazardous cargo shed, live animal shed, cold storage or walk-in coolers and a centre for perishable cargo.""At present most of the cargo is routed through either Chennai or Hyderabad. Apart from international export potentiality, there is scope for growth in domestic cargo as well,"" said DVS Varma, a senior member of the Andha Pradesh Air Travellers Association (APATA).According to sources, Vizag district has SEZs with multinational pharma companies. The city also has potential for petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, textile and seafood exports. The neighboring district of Viziangaram has agricultural based industries such as sugar factories, jute mills and mango production. It also exports high carbon ferro chrome to South Korea. Moreover, Srikakulam has abundant resouces including cashew, coconut, beach sand minerals, granite, and pharmaceutical products. While these north Andhra districts are well connected by road to Vizag, air connectivity would facilitate them with a larger market, stated a study on air cargo by the Gitam University teaching faculty.""Presently, around 4,000 tonne of pharma cargo including products from the coastal region are exported from Hyderabad. If air cargo facilities are provided in the Port City, Hospira, a pharma company based in the district, has told the state that it would export around 2,000 tonne of products per week. As per the Gitam University study, the exports would rise from Rs 200 crore to nearly Rs 3,000 crore in the next couple of years if an air cargo terminal comes up in the port city,"" APATA working president Cheruvu Ramakotayya told TOI.There are chances of exporting flowers from Araku and the famous Kadiyam nurseries that are 200 km away from the Port City, Tours and Travel Operators Association of Andhra Pradesh president K Vijaya Mohan said. ""There is a vast demand for fruits, indoor plants, ornamental plants, medicinal plants and flowers from Kadiyam. At present, flowers from Kadiyam are exported to Dubai, Qatar, Doha, Abu Dhabi, Malaysia, Singapore and Kuwait, besides several other middle eastern countries,' he added.According to sources, the study on cargo potential has revealed that 1.02 lakh tonne of marine products worth Rs 7,578 crore were exported from the city through sea during the 2014-15 fiscal.According to the study, air cargo carried from the four airports in the state was just 0.1% during the 2014-15 fiscal. Out of that, 99% of cargo handling was done at Vizag airport. The state government now plans to increase air cargo handling in the state by almost 5% by 2022, sources said, adding that domestic air cargo increased from 1,107 tonne in 2010-11 to 1,661 tonne in 2015-16 upto January."

The news came as a shock to the city. Score of fans, friends, relatives and general public turned up at his residence in Khurshidbagh to pay tribute.Named Subhash Chandra by his parents, Mudrarakshasa was rechristened so by his teacher Dr Devendra when he had just begun writing. ""Everything about him had a story, even his name. This was when he wanted to critique the work of certain established writers when he himself was very young, that his teacher gave him this new name. The move was meant to not make the senior writers feel challenged by a young boy,"" said his elder son Shiraaz (Romi) Mudrarakshasa.For a certain period, he used the name SC Mudra Rakshasa too, before finally giving up on his original name.The writer had been unwell all through the month of May and had also been admitted to King George's Medical University (KGMU) for a few days, following high sugar levels, fever and loss of appetite. On Monday however, he had a sudden bout of cough after which he was rushed to the Trauma Centre. ""He died on the way to Trauma Centre. Cremation will take place at Baikunth Dham on Tuesday at 11am since my younger brother Romil is coming from Delhi,"" added Romi. Married for 55 years, his widow Indra sat next to where Mudrarakshasa's body lay. ""I had never even dreamt of this day. It is so sudden. Till yesterday, he was fine and was eating too,"" she said. Recalling all the years of togetherness that the couple had spent, Indra said, ""He loved me a lot. I was almost always the first person to read or listen to his fresh writings.""For the last two years, however, Indra said, he had not just stopped writing but had also lost interest in reading. ""I would read out to him from the newspapers to divert his attention but he would just not pay attention. He had made his diabetes an issue for himself,"" she said.Bearing an association of over 40 years, Indian People's Theatre Association's (IPTA) Rakesh Pandey said that his was an all-rounder personality. ""Not just his big works but his smaller writings also garnered public interest. Much like his small pamphlet 'Sava Ser Gehu' that foresaw the troubles with new economic policies and was distributed in lakhs,"" he said.A nature and animal lover, Pandey recalled how Mudrarakshasa would take care of every animal he came across, including an injured squirrel that he had once nurtured.Writer Virendra Yadav , calling Mudrarakshasa an Ambedkarite in his thoughts and an anti-establishment proponent, said, ""He was an iconoclast who wrote with his writings intertwined in burning issues; be it Dalit issues, communalism or economic onslaught."" Yadav also said that for the past two years, the writer had been concerned about the Hindu extremism, communal built-ups and especially the riots in Muzaffarnagar.Remembering the writer, activist Deepak Kabir said, ""Though he was a Hindi writer, he was critical of Hindi itself, not proud of it and called it the language of Brahmans."" Kabir also said that he liked to shock his audiences and would always make an out-of-the-box statement in any debate."

A group of children entertained their grandparents by tapping their feet to a Hindi song and dancing to various tunes.Said Ms. Lydia Joshua: The school's decision to celebrate Grandparents Day is expected to bring about a positive change in the outlook of the present generation. Since many parents prefer nuclear families, children do not learn to value the presence of their grandparents. Hence, we have been conducting the programme for the last six years to let grandparents enjoy the day.""The Paatha Pooja provided glimpses of emotional bonding between the grandparents and the kids. The elders turned radiant and showered their grandchildren with blessings.A health check-up was conducted for the elders by a team from Nandha College of Physiotherapy, to check their blood sugar levels and blood pressure.An overwhelmed grandparent profusely thanked the school authorities for organising such a programme."

We have interests in those countries and they have theirs here,"" a Brazilian foreign ministry official told AFP.Jorge Duany, head of Florida International University's Cuban Research Institute, said, ""Cuba will have to reorient its diplomatic and commercial relations in Latin America and the Caribbean beyond its main regional allies of the last decade.""Cuba may already be moving in that direction, according to Duany.""It's possible to interpret Raul Castro's government's rapprochement with the United States, in part, as a preventive response to the continuous economic and political deterioration in Venezuela,"" he said.Cuba reestablished diplomatic relations with the United States in July 2015 after a half century of Cold War enmity.Even though a US embargo is still in place, the United States could play a growing role as a supplier of food and tourists to Cuba, two important lifelines.""It is reasonable to expect Cuban imports from the United States to continue to grow, especially as restrictions are reduced and, eventually, the embargo is lifted,"" said Shifter.Meanwhile, Cuba has settled its pending affairs with creditors in the Club of Paris, and signed a cooperation agreement with the European Union , which should translate into access to more markets and financing.Cuba will need such a multi-dimensional strategy to weather the storm.cb-vel/cd/jm/dw"

Internationally, practitioners have accepted guidelines put forth by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups which advise testing of fasting blood sugar and vein blood test at the first and second hour after giving the woman 75gm of oral glucose. If any of these values are higher than normal - more than 92mg/dL at fasting, 180mg/DL at the first hour or 153mg/DL at the second hour - the woman is declared a diabetic.In 2014, the Union health ministrydeclared a single-step diagnosis for detection of diabetes in pregnant women as the national guideline, called the Dipsi (Diabetes in Pregnancy Study group of India) guideline. Developed by a team led by Chennai-based diabetologist Dr V Seshiah, it says woman walking into a clinic for pregnancycheck for the first time be given 75g of oral glucose. If the finger prick test done two hours later shows her sugar levels above 140mg/dL, she should be declared a gestational diabetic. ""We prescribed this after nearly three decades of research. It's suitable for Indian conditions,"" said Dr Seshiah.Now, a study published in the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism shows half the number doctors in India follow neither of these guidelines. Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and for future diabetes. In India, anywhere between 3.8% and 21% pregnant women have been diagnosed with diabetes. While prevalence is high in cities like Chennai, Trivandrum, Hyderabad and Mumbai, it is low in rural areas.The survey by diabetologist Dr V Mohan and obstetrician gynaecologist Dr Uma Ram among 3,841 doctors across India found that although 84.9% agreed all women had to be screened for diabetes. But only 67% prescribed it in the first trimester. Though nearly 40% of obstetricians and less than 30% of endocrinologists preferred non-fasting test as per the Indian guidelines, less than 15% of them used the criteria properly.The study also showed that the Indian test has less than 30% sensitivity, a matter of concern. But Dr Seshiah said the Indian protocol was developed keeping in mind some social realities. ""Culturally, pregnant women in India are not allowed to fast and in rural areas, women have to travel a long distance to reach a hospital. It will be impossible for her to come to a hospital without food,"" said Dr Seshiah. ""Asked to come come back to the hospital fasting on another day, nearly 30% of the woman don't come back. There is a good chance of missing diabetes in these women,"" he said.""The single test improves attendance at screening but the technique hasn't been good enough to catch all women. There are false positives,"" said Dr Uma Ram."

The report is awaited, Dhokte said.The victims family will be given compensation of Rs 8 lakhs in the next few days on completion of legal formalities, he said adding that one cage will be installed in the village for trapping a leopard in the night to avert similar incidents in future. The villagers have been sensitised to remain alert.Forest officials on inspecting the spot found that the field is located on the kukdi river on the eastern side of junnar taluka is surrounded by sugar cane on both sides while Saguna was cutting grass on a patch of land in middle of the field.Investigations have revealed that the leopards came from the front and rear side and attacked her. The impact of the attack was such that the hapless woman could not retaliate the leopards nor could she raise an alarm for help. Her family members reached the spot before the leopards could drag her body to the jungle for eating her flesh.Saguna's is the third incident report in the year. A woman was killed in Ranmalawadi in Junnar while another person was injured in a leopard attack around two months ago.eom/as"

The current rate of sugar in market is about Rs 3,200-3,500 per tonne. Mansingh Patel, chairman of Gujarat State Khand Udyog Sangh, said, ""As the sugar market is looking positive, factories have announced the rates on a higher side, which is good for the farmers. We hope the trend will continue and market will further improve."" This year the government has appointed a committee to scrutinize the fair price given to the farmers so the issue of income-tax department sending notices to the sugar cooperatives does not arise. This committee will approve procurement rate of each factory after going through their books of accounts in coming days. With buffer stock being maintained by every factory, the sugar rates are not likely to dip further and sugar cooperatives will also not incur major losses like last year."

Veera Raghava Rao at the farmers' grievance day meeting in the city on Friday. Photo: S. JamesAllegations of widespread corruption at National Cooperative Sugar Mills (NCSM) here and adulteration in cattle feed provided to dairy farmers through Aavin dominated the monthly farmers grievance meeting held at Collectorate here on Friday.N. Palanichamy, an executive committee member at the NCSM and president of Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, alleged that scrutiny of records for 2015-16 at the mill revealed procurement of implausible amount of sugarcane from farmers for crushing.The normal yield on an acre is 35 to 40 tonnes. However, the record shows that in some instances, the mill has procured even up to 76 tonnes per acre from farmers. This indicates that the mill paid the farmers for the actual yield but the records were cooked up to show that the mill paid for more tonnes so as to swindle the excess money, he claimed.Petition submittedIn a petition submitted to Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, Mr. Palanichamy also alleged corruption at the mill in various ways, including in carrying out maintenance work, installation of CCTV cameras and projection of loss due to evaporation at the petrol bunk functioning in the mill.Assuring a swift action, Mr. Rao informed the meeting that a committee headed by District Revenue Officer (DRO) would investigate the allegations and submit a report, based on which action would be taken.Meanwhile, a number of dairy farmers alleged that the cattle feed provided to them through Aavin was adulterated with sand.When I mix five kilos of the feed in water, I can see at least half-a-kilo sand settling down. The cows fall ill and the milk yield also takes a hit, alleged K. Thanikodi, a dairy farmer.P. Tamilalagan, another farmer from Alanganallur, said that because of the adulteration, the dairy farmers were forced to buy cattle feed from outside at a higher price.Officials from Aavin present at the meeting said that the cattle feed was procured from an Andhra Pradesh-based company.We have received complaints and we are in the process of collecting samples for testing, an official said.Mr. Rao instructed the officials to do a preliminary testing of the cattle feed from randomly selected farmers within two days and stop the procurement from the company if there were indications of adulteration.Concerns about clearing of encroachments on waterbodies and completion of maintenance work by Public Works Department were also raised at the meeting. A section of farmers brought a banner with pictures showing dumping of garbage and non-maintenance of the main canal feeding the Madakulam tank.Mr. Rao ordered PWD officials to take up the cleaning work of the canal on priority.DRO K.

They said the dredging was haphazard and disastrous. They also warned of the death of rivers and disasters in the making if the state government continues to wantonly deepen rivers.The state government, ""as an effort to fight drought"" in Marathwada and other parts, has launched a frenzied drive to dredge dry riverbeds so that they can carry and store more water if and when the monsoon arrives. Sugar mills in the state have provided machinery to carry out the work.""Rivers are being deepened with poclain excavators and JCB machines without any environmental understanding. Aquifers are being exposed, angles of river banks and natural flow of the rivers are being destroyed and we still call it 'reviving' of rivers,"" Parineeta Dandekar of South Asia Network on Dams River and People (SANDRP) said on Monday.Experts said removing the vegetation such as trees and shrubs will decrease the banks' stability and increase erosion and siltation during the monsoon. If the rivers' channels are dredged and structures are not realigned, it would increase the risk of flooding. Removing gravel from river beds by dredging will lead to loss of spawning grounds for fish and other species, they added.Dandekar said dredging was not wrong, but one has to understand how thick the gravel layer is. ""Once this layer is removed, water will not percolate and will flow away. Underground streams get exposed and also get polluted if rivers are deepen to 30m. Water vaporizes fast and with loose silt, aquifers get choked. If this happens in a deep aquifer, the damage is irreversible. By doing this, we are destroying treasure accumulated for centuries,"" she added.Himanshu Kulkarni, secretary of ACWADAM, an organization working in the water sector, said watershed planning needs new thinking. ""There must be a combined policy for watershed and aquifers. Agricultural stagnation in India is related to aquifer depletion. The drought today is mostly because water storage in aquifers is less and well water is not sustainable,"" he added.A veteran water activist and a person who has led a people's movement to resuscitate Agrani river in Sangli, said, ""What is happening under the garb of tackling drought is turning rivers into canals. Water will flow from the rivers and lead to environmental disasters. Also, some contractors and politicians are pushing for massive desilting work so that the machinery they own is put to work. Otherwise, these machines are idle as irrigation works have been stopped.""Other experts said massive dredging work will lead to bank erosion. SANDRP experts observed that in many countries river rejuvenation essentially means strengthening of the banks and putting gravel back into the rivers.Kalpanatai Salunkhe of Pani Panchayat, an organization working for water conservation, said, ""The government must have a comprehensive plan in consultation with experts. Only then should dredging be carried out. There is no point in digging rivers here and there. The watershed, river basin and the river's capacity must be studied before dredging or we will have to face problems,"" she said."

Yuvaraj conceived the idea.Now what is happening is the same farmer is going to number of fertilizer outlets and is buying urea. Farmers who can not afford it are also doing it increasing the cost of farming. The software will be integrated with all primary agricultural credit societies and fertilizer dealers and land details provided from Web Land, the State governments portal that covers all land details. Once a farmer goes to any shop and buys fertilizer using an app or computer it will record the quantity online and he cant buy a second time, Mr. Yuvaraj told The Hindu .Using the land details and the crop sown by the farmer, the software will work out the quantity of urea required.The software-driven approach for sale of fertilizer will be introduced on a pilot basis during the present Kharif season and expanded in subsequent crop seasons, Mr. Yuvaraj said.The four sugar factories that supply fertilizer to farmers under them will also be brought onto the platform. Besides, village revenue officers and personnel of the Agriculture Department will use an app, e-crop booking, to record which the crop has sown. Creating awareness among the 4.5 lakh farmers is a part of the programme.The software, is being developed and in its final stages. There has been a tendency among farmers to use more urea as it gives a lush, green look to the crop as well as a substitute for more expensive fertilizers, observed an official of the Agriculture Department.Of the 2 lakh hectares in which agriculture operations are taken up in the district in Kharif, the normal area of paddy is 1.01 lakh ha, sugarcane in 37241 ha and maize in 5878 ha. These are the major crops on which fertilizer is used for soil nutrition besides horticulture crops like mango, cashew and oil palm.According to officials of the Agriculture Department, the total quantity of urea used by farmers during the last Kharif and sold through primary agriculture credit co-operative societies and dealers was around 30,000 tonnes.The plan intends to bring down the use of urea by 5000 to 6000 tonnes this Kharif. ""By scientific use of urea the cost of farming per acre is expected to come down between Rs.1500 and Rs.2000,"" say officials of the Agriculture Department."

The city and state is reeling under a severe water crisis , leading to widespread cuts across all areas. With the issue being uppermost on everyone's minds, citizens, restaurant owners and students are finding ways to conserve water.One of the biggest culprits sits right in your home and office  a leaky faucet or tap that you have been ignoring so far. ""Did you know 40 per cent of water is lost via leakage every day?"" asks city-based water conservationist, Aabid Surti . The 80-year-old Mira Road resident has been repairing taps and plumbing issues in Mumbai for free. He adds, ""Just cutting the quota is a quick solution, but if you plug the leak, you save millions of litres each day. This has been a growing problem as people are too lazy to fix leaking taps. As plumbers charge money per visit and are sometimes not available, this problem goes unattended."" The daily tank overflow in societies is also a major concern. ""As watchmen leave the taps open, there is a huge wastage of water. I wrote to the Municipal Commissioner that we should have two-member flying squads to check for overflows, and fine the guilty parties after issuing a warning,"" he adds.One of the biggest wastages comes from asking for water at restaurants and simply taking a sip or two while leaving the rest. Mumbai citizen Prajakta Samant recently highlighted the need to take action about the half-drunk glass by starting the hashtag movement, 'JitniPyaasUtnaGlass'. Santosh Shetty (General Secretary, Indian Hotel And Restaurant Association) says, ""This is a huge problem and people don't realise it. We have asked waiters and staff not to fill the glass up to the brim, but just a little more than half, each time they serve it. This will help to curtail waste. We will also been putting up posters with messages in restaurants soon.""According to a report, Central and Western Railways have cut down the amount of water used to clean rakes by 50 per cent. Both lines will wash trains after a fortnight, instead of8-10 days.A brouhaha also kicked up recently over watering grounds that would host cricket league matches in Maharashtra. The Bombay High Court came down heavily on the BCCI and cricket associations and apparently asked the cricket body counsel whether ""matches were more important than people or preserving water."" Hence, the court ruled that all matches scheduled in Maharashtra after April 30 must be moved out of the state. This impacts 13 matches, including the final, which was to be held in Mumbai on May 29.Meanwhile, a report talked of how tea without sugar can help save water. A site revealed that Mumbai can save 150 per cent more water by drinking tea without sugar for a day. Agriculture consumes almost 85 per cent of water consumed in India, according to the India Infrastructure Report 2011. And sugar is said to have 15 million litres of water embedded  meaning, it has cost us 15 million litres of water to produce this much sugar. That is said to be 2.5 times the water which would be used in the three cricket match venues in Maharashtra.The Marathwada district in Maharashtra is one of the worst affected areas. As per a news report, the dams in the region are left with just five per cent of water. In drought-hit Latur, which has been battling severe drought for the last three years, there has been a significant rise in cases of kidney stone and urinary tract infection due to consumption of borewell water."

Venkaiah Naidu (Parliamentary Affairs) plunged into damage control exercise, chalking out a roadmap and stringent measures to bring down the prices.The high-powered ministerial panel met on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as growing prices of essential item like potatoes (60 per cent dearer in wholesale markets) and pulses getting costlier by 36 per cent over the past year, pushed up India's annual wholesale inflation for the second month in May to its highest levels in nearly two years.""Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu were not part of the original ministerial team set up recently. But today they attended the meeting as special emissaries of the Prime Minister,"" a source said.""In order to bring down the growing prices of pulses, the government today decided to boost imports via public and private agencies. This will help meet the deficit,"" an official source told IANS.The government is also keen to work out joint strategies with states and sought urgent steps on adequate procurement and actions against hoarders. The meeting, also attended by senior officials from the Food, Finance and Agriculture ministries, reviewed steps taken so far on inadequate storage facilities and procurement problems.The procurement of Rabi (winter) pulses has reached to 64,000 MT while the government has also ordered further import of 12,500 MT pulses for buffer stocks. A ministry source said that together with earlier procurement of 51,000 MT of kharif (summer) crop, total domestic procurement of pulses by June 13 had reached 1,15,000 MT.At the meeting, Paswan also said that while a pulse buffer stock is ready, the response from many states has not been encouraging.Besides pulses, the meeting also discussed the price conditions of tomato, sugar and wheat.Sources also said the meeting was also told that as a precautionary measure the government has procured 20,000 tonnes of onion to create a buffer stock to be utilised for market intervention.Earlier in the day, the Food ministry also flagged off mobile vans for selling pulses at reasonable prices in the capital.Paswan told reporters that ""Our department has been asked to procure more pulses for buffer stock"" and added that a team of officials will visit Myanmar soon to ensure early and smooth import of lentils.India's retail inflation also rose for the second straight month in May to 5.76 per cent from 5.47 per cent in the month before due to a sharp spike in food prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI) data said on Monday.--IANSnd/vd"

M. Pannerselvam, who had switched over to casuarina from sugarcane on his four acres of field, it was quite difficult to meet the expenses for raising sugarcane. He was cultivating sugarcane for the past two-and-a-half decades but the delay in the disbursement of the State Advised Price by the factories had caused him a serious loss.On the other hand, the casuarina crop, though labour-intensive in the initial two or three years, would fetch him adequate profit. Pinning my hopes on higher profitability with less labour and limited irrigation facility, I have raised casuarina trees in my field, he said. He said he had bought 22,000 saplings of casuarina from Peerungalur and planted them in his fields.Agriculture Department officials of Pudukottai concede the fact that there has been a fall in the area of sugarcane cultivation in the district. Also, the area under casuarina crop has been registering an increase. The area under sugarcane cultivation has come down by about 1,000 hectares against the normal of 8,050 hectares in the district. A study has been taken up in the Kundrandarkovil and Pudukottai blocks where the shift was widespread, the sources told The Hindu on Friday. Officials of Agriculture Department in Tiruchi district said that the delay in disbursement of procurement price by a few sugar factories in the central region has forced the cane growers to switch to casuarina.

As many as eight of the region's 11 major dams are at dead storage level. This means that water from the dams cannot flow out but has to be lifted. Last year at this time, the water level in Marathwada's dams was much higher at 11%.""This is the lowest water storage in Marathwada's history but we have sufficient water to last till the monsoon. Dead storage water can be used but has to be pulled out,"" said Aurangabad divisional commissioner Umakant Dangat. ""We also have ground water reserves,"" he added.This is the fourth year of drought in Marathwada in the past five years.Each of its 8,522 villages has been affected for two consecutive years.The state government says it has already instructed local officials to prioritize drinking water. ""We have already cut water supply to industry . The col lectors and divisional commissioner know that the use of water for drinking is the top priority,"" said state water resources minister Girish Mahajan. As many as 2,745 water tankers are being used in the region compared to 939 at this time last year. The government has been sen ding water by train to Latur which faces a severe drinking water crisis. It has also announced a 20% water cut to local breweries and a 10% overall cut to local industry. ""Most sugar factories have finished operations so we have not had to cut water supply for them,"" said Mahajan.Rainfall across the state has been deficient since 2014. The result is that water levels in dams across the state have dipped dramatically .Dams across the state have only 19% water left compared to 32% at this time in 2015. While Marathwada has seen the sharpest decline, dam water levels in north Maha rashtra and western Maharashtra have halved compared to last year.Water levels in western Maharashtra's dams have dropped to 21% from 41% at this time last year.In north Maharashtra, dam water levels have fallen to 16% from 34% last year.In Amravati division, which sees the highest farmer suicides in the state, dam water levels have dropped to 18% from 30% last year.Critics have called for a ban on sugarcane cultivation in the region. Marathwada has as many as 62 sugar factories and over 2 lakh hectares under sugarcane, despite being drought prone. ""For 1 kg of sugar, 2,500 litres of water is used.By growing sugarcane in this region, you are exporting water from a drought-prone area to different states and countries,"" points out water expert Pradeep Purandare."

Wholesale and retail prices have shot up simultaneously. Prices of pulses, which have been rising since a year, still continue to move in the upward direction, hitting the common man's budget hard.While the prices of arhar and masoor dal have gone up to Rs 160 per kg from Rs 110 a month ago, chana dal which was Rs 70 per kg a month ago now costs Rs 130 per kg. Similar spurt in prices has been witnessed in the cost of moong and urad dal.However, according to city-based retailers, the hike is a temporary phase and the prices will go down within a week or two. Though there has been an abrupt hike in prices, it is temporary. ""The price of pulses are usually stable in nature and the recent hike in price is mainly due to shortage of dal production and also because of bulk buyers who create a shortage in the wholesale stock. It is demand like these that attribute to rise in lentil prices,"" a retailer Rajkumar Verma said.He further said that sugar prices are also on the rise and have shot up by Rs. 3-5 per kg. ""It is not just the spiraling price of pulses but even the sugar price has shot up by Rs. 3-5 per kg"", said Verma.Another retailer-cum-wholesaler at Khojwa area, Prince Kumar, attributed the price situation to drought destroying large portion of pulse crops thus, flaring up the prices. Arhar dal has seen the most dramatic increase among staples with the wholesale price recording a rise of 25% in a month.Meanwhile, denizens have started to cut down on the consumption of pulses and are opting for cheaper lentils. ""We were not expecting hike in prices of pulses anymore after suffering in October last year. Although the prices have not shot up as compared to previous year, yet if the trend continues it will soon have to be replaced with other alternatives so that my family gets required amount of protein, said Riddhi Sinha, a housewife."

But that has not deterred him from losing 18 kg in three months.The flabby Fadnavis is determinedly following a disciplined metabolic treatment: a mix of medicines to enhance metabolism, a targeted diet as per his body type and activity level, and a weekly two-hour regimen.The results are just becoming conspicuous.From 122 kg when he first consulted a doctor in December, Fadnavis is now going on 104. His target to get that lean-mean look is 88-90 kg. If he keeps at his diet-exercise regimen with the same vigour he has had since February when he started it, he should achieve success in three more months.His doctor, Jayashree Todkar, a metabolic and bariatric surgeon, said, ""His evaluation went on for two months; we learnt his metabolism was flexible and could be enhanced by medical intervention. We started him on the medicines which had a collateral result, in clearing his problem of sugar intolerance.""When Mumbai Mirror contacted Fadnavis, he responded with, ""Sorry, that's too personal.Would not like to speak on that.""His wife Amruta, who inspired him to shed the flab, was happy to talk. ""He had lost weight earlier but gained it again due to work pressure and erratic schedule. After I started my weight loss programme and lost about 5-6 kg, he was inspired,"" said Amruta. She vouched that losing weight increases one's vigour and energy to work.Todkar told Mumbai Mirror that he was simultaneously asked to use a pedometer to gauge his activity level. ""While he has an erratic work schedule involving a lot of travel, it turned out that his activity level was pretty good. He not only goes above the required minimum of 10,000 steps daily, but also walks briskly,"" she explained. She said his weight gain was mainly because the diets he was prescribed earlier had not been helping him; according to sources, he has been one of the biggest names in the business - including Bollywood faves - for shedding weight.Holistic health guru Mickey Mehta was also roped into the regimen. He is training the CM in physical activity, which involves two hours a week of a lot of breathing exercises, agility-and-strength training and sport stretches. ""He gets merely four to five hours of sleep. The breathing exercises help in taking care of the sleep deprivation,"" said Mehta, who is also training Amruta. ""We are aiming to get back his athletic body by end of this year,"" Mehta added.According to Todkar, understanding metabolism is the crux of weight loss. ""Metabolism is a chain of events in the body which needs to be studied closely. It involves understanding the hunger pattern and satiety level and the process of breakdown of energy after consumption. With bad metabolism, the body begins storing things resulting in problems like obesity, cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, and all these ailments complicate each other too,"" Todkar said.His diet regimen is as per his palate and nutritional requirements.""Studies have shown that the hunger hormone graph shows elevation thrice in 24 hours. So three healthy meals in a day are enough to be energised and suffice the nutritional requirements of a person,"" said Todkar.Fadnavis now has three meals a day. His regimen has been fluctuating for the past three months but his current chart involves a balance of proteins and fats, minimised carbohydrates and fibre.Since he doesn't have a sweet tooth, he has been allowed the luxury of one cup of tea a day. But Fadnavis prefers sugar-free if he decides to sip on chai. His proteins involve a mix of vegetarian (paneer, lentils) and non-vegetarian (chicken, fish).His carbs come from bhakri, chapati or wholewheat bread. His sources of fibre are green vegetables and low-glycemic fruits like pomegranate, apple, jamun etc. He doesn't have to cheat to have butter or ghee; he is allowed both, though in moderation and not in dollops.""If you see his chart, he is allowed to eat all kinds of food. What is important is how the food is prepared. He is neither allowed outside food nor junk food,"" said Todkar."

Henceforth, cotton farmers will get similar support and Nandgaopeth textile park would serve as a model,"" said Fadnavis.Raymond is to invest 1400 crore at Nangaonpeth where linen, denim, cotton shirting and garmenting facilities would come, providing at least 8,000 jobs.The factory spread on 200 hectares would come up in phases and the first unit is likely to start operations by March next.""Our government has introduced a policy of value addition of every agro-product so that farmers get good remunerative prices for their produce and unemployed youths of the area get jobs,"" he said and added that his government is developing 10 textile parks in all cotton-producing regions of Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra.Besides this, orange processing units in orange-growing areas and edible oil units in soyabean-producing regions are being set up to bring value addition of the products.He said that such steps would prevent farm-suicide in the region. Amravati will soon be booming textile city and no longer be the suicide capital of farmers,"" said the chief minister. He also inaugurated Siyaram's textile unit in a separate function on Saturday.Fadnavis said the Nandgaonpeth five star MIDC area, spread over about 2,800 kms, was developed 15 years ago. However, it failed to attract a single industrial unit there. ""But our sincere efforts to promote industrial growth has paid off. Today, there is a race among investors to get land here.""Lauding the assurance by Raymond that it will start production by March next year, Fadanvis said Raymond has a unit in Yavatmal and the cotton growers will be greatly benefited by the second unit in Amravati. He hailed the Raymond's holistic approach in setting up a housing complex with an international standard school and the company's proposal to help set up an apparel and fashion zone here.Raymond had agreed to set up its second unit after Yavatmal in Amravati in the month of February early this year during the ""Make in India"" event in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and within a span of two months the bhoomipujan of the project was performed. On the occasion, Gautam Hari Singhania, the CMD of Raymond, said that along with generation of multiple employment opportunities it will contribute substantially to the overall development of the region.Industries minister Subhash Desai said he was happy that Raymond kept pace with the government's fast clearances for the project and started work here in record time.

Latest estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) showed the prevalence of diabetes in India has doubled from 32 million in 2000 to 63 million in 2013.The health groups and agencies raising the issue include the George Institute for Global Health from Australia & India, Centre for Science and Environment, World Obesity Federation and World Public Health Nutrition Association. Besides, Alliance for the Control of Tobacco Use and Health Promotion, Brazil and the Nutritional Health Alliance, Mexico are also part of the consortium.The groups have also written to major institutional investors of these companies.In February, Centre for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) had released a report  'Carbonating the World' - highlighting the billions of dollars spent by Coke and Pepsi in countries like Brazil, China, India, and Mexico to promote sugar-drink sales. CSPI said soda companies are following in the footsteps of tobacco companies as they are now targeting developing nations after sales plummeted in developed countries.The advocates of public health have also urged the manufacturers of sugary drinks to reduce container sizes, include warning notices about adverse health effects on soda containers, reduce the calorie content of beverages to no more than 40 calories per 12 ounces, and stop fighting public health measures aimed at reducing soda consumption, such as taxes, warning labels, or marketing restrictions.In India, the health ministry is working on a proposal to levy higher taxes and tougher advertising norms on junk food and sugar-sweetened beverages to cut consumption, mainly among children. The measures are part of a bigger action plan being drawn by the government to control the growing incidence of diabetes in the country.Dr Vivekanand Jha, executive director, The George Institute for Global Health says, ""Around 2 lakh deaths occur every year due to sugar related diseases. The negative impact of sugar is a critical area to be worked upon and we are sure that with talks about imposing higher taxes on sugar items, we will be able to curb the consumption to a large extent.""According to the Diabetes Foundation and Centre of Nutrition and Metabolic Research, in India, the per capita consumption of sugary beverages has gone up by more than five times since 1998."
58f5ac867be9e01a357a5684,Remembering Srinivas,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Remembering-Srinivas/articleshow/52063296.cms,2016-05-01,"The pioneering social anthropologist from Mysuru who delved deep into India's social structure to come up with coinages like votebank and Sanskritization, continues to fascinate social scientists. In his 100th birth year, a few are trying to set up a chair in his name at Oxford UniversityBENGALURU: By all accounts, it was a mythical village. The exact co-ordinates remained unknown till a group of anthropologists from Mysore University teamed up with specialists from Anthropological Survey of India's to locate Rampura. Not satisfied, Professor Tanka B Subba, now vice-chancellor of Sikkim University, went with Mysore anthropologists in 2007 to ascertain that it is indeed the same place before bringing a group of eager students to see the place.Kodagahalli, around 30km from Mysore, is no El Dorado but just another dusty village off Hogur Road. However, social scientists from across the world might disagree. They know it as Rampura, the village that was studied by renowned sociologist MN Srinivas, the man who delved deep into India's caste system and social structure to come up with by-now popular coinages like 'votebank', 'dominant caste' and 'Sanskritization'.Just in time for Mysuru-born Srinivas's birth centenary this year (November 16), professor David Gellner of Oxford University dropped in recently at 'Rampura'. ""I wanted to see the famous 'Remembered Village' (the lucid account of the village field study),"" says professor Gellner, who hopes that the Karnataka government will help fund a Srinivas Chair at Oxford University, his alma mater. Gellner spent only a few hours, but was struck by the ""relative prosperity of the village"".Subba and his students consider themselves lucky as they spent about a month at the village, trying their best to study the place and note the changes. What struck the professor was Srinivas's observation skill. ""Everything was just as he had described 60 years ago - the Cauvery canal, the nearby lagoon, sugar cane farms, closely packed houses and tiled roofs,"" he says. And of course, caste was omnipresent. There were separate quarters for lower castes and a street exclusively for high caste people. ""Time seemed frozen there. It was shocking for my students to see such open caste discrimination,"" he recalls.Rampura achieved mythical status because of the breadth of Srinivas's work. The impact wasn't limited to the academic world. ""It will be difficult to think of any other intellectual with whom the public associates concepts like Sanskritization (a tendency to refashion lifestyles and habits to those of the dominant communities) and dominant caste,"" says Chandan Gowda, sociology professor at Azim Premji University.In this election year, votebank remains the most relevant. ""He had used it to mean, in an essay in the mid-1950s, the number of votes a village patron, who had cultivated ties of financial and other kinds of dependence with villagers, could enlist in favour of an election candidate,"" says Gowda.This too came from Rampura, says former student and sociologist Gopal Karanth. ""He took a long time to process his (field) notes from 1948. In 1952, when elections were around, he happened to be there,"" says Karanth, former professor of sociology at Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru.Srinivas noted that a young man, a rebel otherwise, didn't seem to question the old authority structure when it came to the election. ""He followed the existing authority system as leaders always looked after the followers, or the votebank,"" says Karanth. Now, everybody has a votebank, even Donald Trump, he laughs.Most of the concepts that Srinivas coined lend themselves to being in currency long after they were formulated. ""So much so that, Sankritization has come to have new meaning even as the hierarchy of castes has begun to disappear. This was the character of Srinivas, to remain relevant decades since he first studied Rampura,"" says Karanth.No seemingly small detail or news item escaped his notice. Srinivas was the one to point out the 'horizontal spread' of caste in post-independent India, says professor Shyam Bhatt, who translated Remembered Village into Kannada.Caste system has always been local. For instance, Vokkaligas constitute the dominant group in old Mysore state area while it is Bunts in South Canara. ""These groups are likely to have contact with barbers, washermen and labourers of lower caste in their own area,"" says Bhatt.Once the states re-organised, the dominant groups started contacting people from similar caste structures to create a backward class movement. In Karnataka, Vokkaligas and Lingayats came together to demand reservation in jobs, says Bhatt. It didn't matter that they didn't have much in common. ""In fact, barbers across the region also formed associations during that time. This horizontal spread was first noticed by Srinivas and is still relevant,"" he says.Srinivas had warned that caste was not about to disappear but would rather transform in manifold ways, says Gellner. The best time to test these concepts is now. ""We should see how the BJP will break into the votebanks in West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadhu where it has never had a following,"" says Gowda.It is important to see how the pull of Sanskritization might play a role in making voters gravitate towards certain political parties. ""Sanskritization, which MNS emphasized, could include upper castes as well the elite among Muslims, Christians, and tribals for instance. Does voting for a political party also be part of this process?"" Gowda wonders.While Srinivas continues to fascinate social scientists, his biggest achievement was in reaching out to the public. ""Remembered Village is a unique work. For the first time in India, he wrote the book in common man's language without reducing the sociological concepts. In a way, he was trying to have a discourse with people who are interested in village studies,"" says Bhatt. It was also because his processed notes got burnt down while he was a fellow at the Stanford University.Srinivas's towering reputation also stemmed from his many works, and the positions he occupied. He was joint-director at ISEC, JRD Tata visiting professor at NIAS, professor of sociology at the universities of Delhi and Baroda, and visiting positions at Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, Cornell and Canberra. As a doctoral student at Oxford, famous professors like Radcliffe-Brown and Evans-Pritchard mentored him.There were detractors who felt that Srinivas focused too much on caste, or that he may have relied solely on the participation observation method without data to support conclusions. He was also a social anthropologist trained in the British tradition whereas Indian sociologists followed the American tradition in 1960s and 70s. Bhatt says the criticism isn't valid as participant observation is essential to get a feel of the society. ""For later Sanskritization studies, he used data from different parts of India,"" says Bhatt.To Karanth, the strongest memories of his mentor are of the daily phone conversations about seemingly obscure news items in newspapers, academic discussions over dosa and coffee at his Benson Road residence, and Srinivas's gracious acceptance of his student's insight about Sankritization that turned the concept upside down. ""Scholarship was always a two-way process with him,"" says Karanth.Srinivas was also fond of good food and drinks, and made a mean cocktail. The families of Karanth and Srinivas used to frequent Monarch restaurant at Shivaji Circle. ""We would go in an old Fiat car and he would teach my children to eat western food using a fork and knife,"" smiles Karanth.Srinivas was a devoted friend to writer RK Narayan, childhood buddy and neighbour from Mysuru. The last trip Srinivas made was to see his friend in Chennai in 1999. His wife Rukmini Srinivas, a popular TV chef and author of a memoir-cookbook called Tiffin, now resides in the United States with her daughters.Karanth says despite his legacy, institutions and the government don't seem to have any plans for the centenary year. ISEC is slated to hold a symposium later this year."

The negative impact of sugar is a critical area to be worked upon and we are sure that with talks about imposing higher taxes on sugar items, we will be able to curb the consumption to a large extent.''Endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi from Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, said sugar intake posed a problem if coupled with inactivity. ""We should encourage our children to take up sports and be less inactive,"" he said.The George institute recently joined several health groups across the world to write to multinational companies to to stop marketing and advertising of the sugar-sweetened beverages to children. Excess sugar intake increases the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, among other diseases. ""Children are the worst affected by these disorders as all marketing and advertising campaigns for sugar-sweetened beverages are targeted on them,"" added Dr Jha.Two studies from India in the last two years have underlined the need to increase taxes levied on sweet-laden foods and drinks. In early 2014, a study in PLOS Medicine journal said India's rising obesity and diabetes epidemics could be tackled by imposing a substantial tax of 20% on sugary soda. ""A 20% tax may avert 4.2% of prevalent overweight and obesity, and reduce diabetes incidence by 2.5%, from 2014 to 2023,"" it said.A study by Delhi-based endocrinologist Dr Anoop Misra in Nutrients journal in 2014 said that 1.8 cans of cola per week among children and adolescents in urban India could result in nearly 1.3 kg of weight gain per child per year."

In women, no such association was observed, said the studys senior author, Femke Rutters, from the VU Medical Centre in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.The study examined sleep duration and diabetes risk factors in 788 people.The researchers analysed a subset of participants in the European Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease (EGIR-RISC) study. The subset comprised healthy adults aged between 30 and 60. Study participants were recruited from 19 study centres in 14 European countries.Researchers measured the participants sleep and physical activity using a single-axis accelerometer, a device to track movement.To assess the risk for diabetes, researchers used a device called a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to measure how effectively the body used the hormone insulin, which processes sugar in the bloodstream.The study found that men who slept the least and the most were more likely to have an impaired ability to process sugar compared to those who slept an average amount, about seven hours. The men at either end of the spectrum had higher blood sugar levels than those who got the average amount of sleep.Women who slept less or more than average, however, were more responsive to the hormone insulin than women who slept the average amount.They also had enhanced function of beta cells  the cells in the pancreas that produce the hormone insulin. This suggests lost sleep may not put women at increased risk of developing diabetes. The study is the first to show opposite effects of lost sleep on diabetes risk in men and women.Even when you are healthy, sleeping too much or too little can have detrimental effects on your health, Mr. Rutters said.This research shows how important sleep is to a key aspect of health  glucose metabolism, Mr. Rutters added.The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.  PTIResearch in Europe shows that men who sleep poorly or excessively show less response to insulin"

This will enable the doctors to assess the blood sugar level among people and initiate appropriate treatment and medical care.With the help of HbA1c analyser when the blood sugar level over a duration is found, the doctor can ascertain if the patient has achieved glycemic control or not and also is he or she is at risk of developing complications, said Arun Padhi, additional district medical officer (public health) Koraput. The test report will be helpful in treating the patient, he said.Hence, with the availability of the HbA1c analyser in the district, patients are no longer required to be referred to big hospitals or medical colleges for these tests. While doing the test at private clinics and other cities is much costly, at the hospitals in Koraput and Jeypore it could be done by paying only Rs 200, Padhi said.According to official records, around 10% of the Koraput population are affected with diabetes. During 2015-16, as many as 1,00,186 people, including 57,138 females, were screened for suspected diabetes, of which 8,920, including 4,245 females, were found to be diabetic.The district administration is hopeful that with advanced diabetes diagnosis equipment, the disease can be checked in rural areas. The administration has chalked out an ambitious plan to screen more people in rural areas by conducting special health camps at the 14 block headquarters and four urban areas of the district. Apart from other health tests, the blood glucose level of people attending the health camps will be conducted and those found with high sugar level will be referred either to the DHH or the SDH for detailed diagnosis and treatment, said collector (Koraput) Jaya Kumar V."

Deshpande clarified that the State government would not provide any funds to resume production at MPM.Mr. Deshpande said that an amount of Rs. 25 crore was required to resume production. As the firm had been incurring a loss over the past few years, it would be non-viable to make further any investment in it. The Minister has instead directed the management of MPM to explore the possibilities of running the firm by leasing it out to private parties.Mr. Deshpande has also asked the management to go ahead with its plan to trim the workforce through voluntary retirement scheme (VRS).He said that the State government would release necessary funds for VRS. According to an estimate, more than one lakh tonne sugarcane has been cultivated by farmers in Bhadravati taluk in the hope that the produce would be purchased for the sugar generating unit of MPM. Commenting on this Mr. Deshpande said that the State government would take necessary measures to ensure that the sugarcane is purchased by sugar factories in neighbouring districts. It may be mentioned here that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had ordered a halt on the production at MPM from December 15, 2014, on the grounds that the firm had failed to abide by norms related to checking environmental pollution. The MPM had approached the Southern Bench of National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the order. The closure of this case recently had made workers here optimistic about the resumption of production.After the production came to a halt, the management sent 1,134 workers on compulsory leave in November 2015 and served similar orders to around 150 workers this year on February 28. The permanent workers sent on compulsory leave are being paid an advance salary of Rs. 9,000 per month and contract workers are being paid Rs. 4,500.Following the denial of funds by the State government, a meeting of MPM Employees Association was held in Bhadravati on July 14 to discuss the future course of action.C.S. Shivamurthy, president of the Association told The Hindu that the major chunk of the workers wanted MPM to continue as a PSU. If leasing out the firm to private parties is inevitable, the decision in this regard should be taken at the earliest and workers sent on compulsory leave should be offered employment.The State government should provide proper information to the employees on VRS, including the monetary compensation the employees would get from it. In addition to this, the possibilities of deputing workers serving here to various departments and corporations of the State government should be considered, he said."

Television cameras will love the aerial shots above Copacabana beach , or views from the famous Christ the Redeemer statue as it peers over Sugar Loaf mountain and Guanabara Bay.But problems still hang over South America's first games, the most unsettled in decades.Brazil President Dilma Rousseff is being impeached and is likely to be suspended when the games open Aug. 5, partly as fallout from Brazil's worst recession in decades, 10 percent unemployment, and a $3 billion bribery scandal involving the state-run oil company Petrobras.Away from politics, the Zika virus threatens athletes and tourists. Ticket sales are lukewarm, and the bacteria and virus-filled venues for sailing, rowing, canoeing and open-water swimming could put 1,600 athletes competing there at risk.The deaths of two people last week when a new Olympic legacy cycling path collapsed into the sea have raised doubts about construction standards in the rush to build.In addition, a labor minister report Monday said 11 workers have died on Olympic-related projects since January 2013.The Associated Press asked a wide range of Brazilians _ and non-Brazilians _ to predict how the games will unfold. Here are some of the replies.___Briton Michael Payne , former marketing director of the International Olympic Committee: ``The Rio Olympics will surprise everyone. No question, the country is facing the `perfect storm' _ political and economic meltdown, Zika, construction delays. But in the end, the unique and incredible stage of the city _ perhaps one of the most dramatic visual backdrops of any Olympics to date _ and the carnival atmosphere of the Brazilians will overcome these problems. There is clear potential to be truly great games. For those working behind the scenes, it will be tough. Very tough.''___Brazilian Sergio Praca, political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation: ``The Rio de Janeiro Olympics will, at best, be a non-event. Brazilians are too occupied with politics. At worst, we'll see violence and the collapse of the city's infrastructure.''___Brazilian Juliana Barbassa, author of ``Dancing with the Devil in the City of God'': ``The games will be a beautiful, tightly-controlled spectacle set against a backdrop that has stunned visitors for nearly 500 years. Those marveling from afar may not even notice the serious budgetary crisis facing the city and the state, and the tremendous cost that this global party has had for locals. But that cost _ both in money and in missed opportunities and misplaced priorities _ is significant, and Rio will not recover for decades to come.''___American Susan Francia, two-time Olympic rowing gold-medalist: ``The Olympics in Rio de Janeiro will go off without a hitch. The IOC always pulls it together, even if it's at the last minute. I think Brazil will put on a fantastic event and the Brazilians will show their incredible hospitality.''___American Jules Boykoff, political scientist at Pacific University; author of ``Power Games: A Political History of the Olympics'': ``I imagine Rio organizers and their allies will perpetually profess that the Olympics will be a high point of the summer. It seems to me that it is just as possible that the Olympics will become a focal point of discontent. Rather than a happy-faced antidote to the political mayhem gripping the country, Rio 2016 could actually stoke dissent as the sharp contradictions of the games _ Olympic elites living the high life while hospitals are being shuttered _ become more and more obvious.''___Brazilian Marina Izidro, reporter for Sportv: ``The Rio Olympics will have an amazing atmosphere for spectators and athletes, especially Brazilians who have been waiting for the moment to compete in their country for the last four years. In terms of organization and infrastructure, there will be issues because of bad planning. My fear is how big these problems might be.''___Spaniard Edu Sotos, correspondent for the Barcelona daily El Periodico de Catalunya: ``I believe Brazilian authorities are crossing their fingers and hoping no misfortune strikes during the Olympics. The pace at which (Olympic) projects were built is a recipe for disaster. I think things will work reasonably well, but I don't want to think what might happen in case of a terrorist attack _ a possibility Brazilian intelligence has brought up. I guess right now everyone is asking: Was it really a good idea to choose Brazil for an event of this size?''___American Brant Feldman, sports agent, American Group Management: ``Athletes train for their one moment in time every four years to show that they are the best in their particular discipline. You want fair play to be the only thing that matters. It is your best versus the competitor's best. Things like pollution in the bay and ocean ... is sad to me, to be honest. All I have heard about the Brazilian people is that they love to have a great time, to show the world how to party. Let's buckle up and enjoy the show.''"

Muhammed Majeed, founder of the Rs 600-crore nutraceuticals focused Sami Group, is eager to know if the lemon tea he is offering in the office of his research and manufacturing hub in Bengaluru tastes like regular lemon tea. It does, but with a slightly sugary aftertaste. Majeed, 67, chuckles and reveals that the tea has been sweetened, not with sugar but with what could be a game-changing gamble for his firm: a natural sweetener that has zero calories, derived from the monk fruit.Grown in China for hundreds of years, the green monk fruit, or lo han kuo, is 200-300 times sweeter than sugar but with zero calories. ""Until 1980, no one outside China knew such a fruit even existed. Then, P&G went and took a patent but that has now expired,"" says Majeed, adding that he has been pursuing this product for the past five years. And with good reason. It sounds like the holy grail of sweeteners, both for companies looking to win over calorieconscious consumers and diabetics, a group rapidly increasing in India. A recent report by the World Health Organisation found that the number of diabetics in India has doubled from 2003, to over 60 million. ""I can get the seeds out of China but I need land. I'm working with a major group to get a 5,000-acre plantation,"" he says.Majeed, who already cultivates medicinal plants on 6,000 acres in India through contract farming, considers himself one of the people who introduced ayurveda to the US, in the early 1990s. But that wasn't why he went to the US. Majeed, who is from Kollam in Kerala, had gone to New York to do his doctorate in industrial pharmacy and then worked with pharma firms, including drug major Pfizer.Ayurveda in America While looking around for entrepreneurial opportunities, Majeed noticed that there was hardly any export of ayurvedic products. ""Only three ayurvedic items were being exported to the US and, for some reason, all three were laxatives!"" he recalls. Majeed sensed an opportunity but he also realised that Americans might not accept ayurvedic products in the form Indians were used to. ""My US education and pharma experience made me realise that there were no modern proofs in ayurveda.But we could present ayurvedic drugs with proper data,"" he says. So Majeed set about standardising ayurvedic products, getting them clinically tested and their toxicology evaluated. This, he feels, ushered the ayurvedic boom in the US and is also what set him apart from the traditional practitioners in India. Since launching Sabinsa Corporation (named after his wife), in the US in 1991, Majeed has managed to get over 100 patents for his products and sells his nutraceutical, wellness and cosmetic products in over 15 countries, with India contributing to 8% of turnover.The key, he says, was standardisation, which could be the path that other ayurvedic medicine manufacturers might want to take to enter the nutraceutical and wellness export market, estimated to be worth $182 billion. ""I created a reference standard so that we knew, chemically, that we were getting the same material each time. With traditional products, it can vary because of different factors,"" he says. For example, there is a plant in ayurveda that has certain alkaloids that are good for breathing problems. ""If you gather it in January, it will have 2% alkaloids, in April 4% and in September, nothing. So if we collect it in September, it will have no efficacy,"" he says.In standardisation, the active ingredients are isolated. ""My first product, for example, had two active ingredients, which I isolated and then ensured that every gram would contain 2.5% of these ingredients,"" he explains. From Garcinia cambocia, a pot tamarind in Kerala, the firm isolated and standardised hydroxycitric acid, an appetite suppressant, which became one of its major exports since 1994. The first US patent came two years later for bioperine, an extract from black pepper. To make turmeric palatable to the American market as a skin-whitening agent, before which it was used as a cheese-colouring agent, the company introduced white turmeric, which had the same properties but without the yellow colour. Major customers for curcumin, the chemical in turmeric, include Avon and Amway. Despite standardisation and clinical tests, Sami products are still sold as nutraceuticals, which the US Food and Drug Administration does not certify as medicine. Majeed himself says these should be taken as supplements and not as a substitutes for allopathic drugs.Though Majeed's focus has been on the export market, his monk fruit gambit will be centred on India. ""The monk fruit extract will be sold globally but my priority will be India because we are No. 2 in diabetes,"" he says. ""If we have one enemy now, that's fructose. In processed foods, 5-20% fructose is added, and it can cause Type II diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. People should use other natural sugars."" Dr Aruna Bhat, consultant diabetologist at Apollo Sugar clinic in Bengaluru, says natural sugar substitutes with fewer calories are a better option for diabetics and those looking to restrict their calorie intake.A 2013 Reuters report suggests the ""obscure melon once cultivated by Buddhist monks in China"" might be the ""miracle ingredient"" the $8 billion diet soda industry in the US is looking for to win back customers. Closer home, if large-scale production becomes a reality, it might also be a welcome substitute for the growing diabetic population and a shot in the arm for Majeed."

Sugar cane crop grown in state annually guzzles water that could otherwise quench thirst of 100 crore population throughout the year. The overzealous promotion of sugar industry by Pawar is the sole cause of the drought in state which has depleted even groundwater,"" said Desarda.As vice-president of Pune-based 'Dushkal Nivaran, Nirmulan Mandal,' Desarda has toured 20 drought affected districts, eight of them in worst-hit Marathwada and seven in Vidarbha. He said more than natural, the drought was man made driven by wrong policies.Desarda said the drought situation was now much worse than in 1972 when at least groundwater and semblance of sensitivity were available. Now even that has been exhausted for non-essential crops like sugar cane, he said.Desarda is also not much enthused by the water conservation measures like Jalyukta Shivar Yojana being pursued by the current state government. ""Monstrous machines are being used to change course of a river in the name of rejuvenation. All this could lead to geographical disasters as there is no scientific base to the water conservation projects,"" he alleged.

They are immediately cut into tiny cubes and smeared with salt and chili powder, and at times asafetida. The crunchy mangoes add some extra spice to the summer fish curry and rice.Pickles made from raw mango can go from this simple preparation to the very complex chepnemchi toram. As the name suggests, the raw mangoes are first compressed under the weight of a stone before a coarse mixture of ground fenugreek, mustard, asafetida, pepper, chilli, turmeric and salt is stuffed inside. The aromatic masala is held intact by a thread tied around each of the raw mangoes, which are then stored in oil. If made the 'right way' it can last for a year or more, your mum will tell you.Another classic is the sweet mango pickle, made from semi-ripe mangoes, for which every Goan granny has a twist of her own. Siolim resident Ana Luiza Fernandes says that her grandmother would make her sugar syrup for the pickle with vinegar. ""Ground garlic and ginger is added to the syrup and later mangoes and chilli powder.""In Hindu kitchens, where the vinegar is non-existent, the semi-ripe mangoes are cooked with jaggery to a thick consistency and a fonn or tadka of asafetida, mustard seeds and green chilly is added.Saatt (mango leather) is another common preparation in Hindu homes, made from pulp of ripe mangoes. Here, the pulp of the overripe mangoes is simply cooked into a thick consistency and poured into as thin a layer as possible on steel plates. After two to three days of drying in the sun, a thin and sweet chewy replacement for toffee is ready for the children of the house.Ambya sansanv is also a must during the season in most Hindu homes even today.""Salt and jaggery is added to the pulp of mango and a finely-ground masala made from grated coconut, green chillies, dry chillies and mustard is added to it. The mustard is added to the masala during the last stage of grinding and this gives the dish its prominent taste. That is why the dish is named sansanv or mustard,"" says Mayem-based homemaker Malini Pandurang Shetye.Sansanv needs no cooking, so also with mango gozzu, where jaggery and a fonn of curry leaves, green and dry chilly and mustard is added.But till date the most popular preparation of ripe mangoes is the jam, known as mell or halwo, by Goans. While some like theirs cooked with cinnamon, others add cardamom for taste and yet others like ginger in theirs.The popularity of this preparation is understandable, for what won't a true blue Goan do to make the flavour of this favourite fruit last all through the year!"

He also announced that NCP would launch a severe agitation from June 5 if the state government failed to declare a loan-waiver for farmers among other relief measures, including adequate arrangements for livestock and financial help to peasant community ahead of the start of kharif season.While sugarcane cultivation has been attributed by experts as one of the key reasons for water-scarcity in Marathwada, Pawar said natural calamity in the form of deficient monsoon should be blamed for drought situation in the region and not the crop itself.""Marathwada has around 50 sugar mills that have been successfully running for more than five decades. The very existence of these mills for such a long period implies that the sugarcane cultivation should not be blamed. The current scarcity is an isolated case that has taken place due to a natural calamity,"" he said.Refuting charges against Marathwada farmers that they consume excess water for cultivation of sugarcane, Pawar said the farmers should be given a subsidy for drip irrigation along with waivers for electricity bills as immediate relief.Pressing for the demand for loan-waivers, the former Union Agriculture Minister came down heavily against the Centre.""The Centre is ready to dole out Rs one lakh crore to banks to address the issue of bad loans, but not keen to release relatively smaller amounts for offering relief to farmers. While on one hand, farmers have been committing suicides in large numbers, on the other hand the government has been adamant on its stand,"" Pawar said.He also criticised the measures announced by the state government to restructure farmers loans as a relief measure. ""The proposed measure is nothing but fooling poor farmers. The farmers will have to pay heavy interests on fresh loans in an accumulated way,"" the NCP chief said.Listing out major demands for the benefit of farmers, Pawar said his party would give both the Centre and the state time till June 5 to act, otherwise party workers would take to the streets.Addressing farmers, he said,""You need to show your might in a democratic and non-violent way. We do not want to politicise the issue of drought, and ready to cooperate with the government.""Recalling the drought of 1972 , Pawar said the then Maharashtra government had shown ""sensitivity and seriousness"" in dealing with the crisis.Families affected due to incidents of farmers suicide from Aurangabad district were offered aid of Rs 15,000 in the presence of Pawar during drought-meet.NCP leaders such as Ajit Pawar, Sunil Tatkare, Jayant Patil, Jaydatt Kshirsagar, Dhananja Munde, Padmsinh Patil, Nawab Malik, Rajesh Tope, Fauziya Khan, Satish Chavan, Bhausaheb Patil Chikatgaokar among others were present on the occasion."

But Sonabai Daware, who lives just a kilometre away on the fringes of the town, hasn't even made a trip to the temple after the much-acclaimed victory.

The water in the well is green, filthy and stinking. It is difficult to breathe while standing near the well. Akkatai's biggest fear is that she could miss a step some day and fall into the well.""We don't know why the water is so green and smelly.However, we have no option but to use this water. Women are the biggest sufferers in times of water scarcity. We are the ones who walk for miles to fetch water. Just as standing on the chauthara of the Shani temple is a woman's right, so is water. But who cares about us? We have not seen our elected representatives since the last elections,"" another woman said.The temple town itself gets water through tankers as the village water scheme cannot cater to the residents and visitors. ""Already, four lodges have shut down as their borewells have gone dry. Shingnapur has water for just 10-12 days. The canal is almost dry. In the next few days, the entire town will have to depend on tankers,"" a villager, Pandurang Gurav, said.As devotees, especially women, flock to the temple town, the number of tankers is multiplying. But these tankers are for tourist devotees like Kavita from Madhya Pradesh. She exults about the temple entry fight, saying it was for women's rights and that justice has been done.But for the unsung, unheard local women, getting clean water in adequate supply would alone constitute true justice."

Considering the need of the hour, MARD would be urging the government authorities to implement such a programme to address the problem,"" said Sagar Mundada, president of MARD.""The resident doctors have started a campaign since Saturday in government hospitals. We have been distributing booklets in Hindi and English to address misconceptions prevailing in the society about the disease,"" he said.MARD also carried out a survey among 200 outdoor patients in three government hospitals, which showed that people are still ill-informed about the disease, especially those who from the lower economic and social strata.""As part of the study, the doctors asked several questions to patients to measure their awareness about diabetes. But the patients failed to give correct answer to most questions, which goes to show how ill-informed people are about the disease,"" Mundada said.""For example, when patients were asked if diabetes was only seen among people belonging to the post middle-age group, 146 of the 200 surveyed patients said yes, which is incorrect,"" he said.""According to a study, more than 60% of the respondents think that if no person in a family is diabetic, there are no chances of others getting it. Throwing light on it, the doctors told the patients that although the chances of diabetes are more if it runs in the family, even people without any history can get it,"" the MARD president said.""Last year, the World Health Organization announced that sugar is the new tobacco. Just as tobacco is one of the leading causes of cancer, sugar leads to diabetes. Yet people don't view diabetes seriously. There are reasons to view diabetes as one of the most serious public health problems in India. In terms of prevalence of the disease, India is the second largest in the world. The International Diabetes Federation pegs the number of patients with diabetes in India at 65.1 million, which was 50.8 million in 2010. The number is expected to cross 100 million by 2030,"" Mundada said."

The units have been documented and uploaded.An in-house survey last year found that most of the assistance through bank linkages is going towards consumption meeting the needs of the members of the groups rather than helping them improve their livelihood through self-employment or some business. It covered 12,005 of the 23,000 groups in GVMC and said that a mere 17,559 members had invested, 34,000 proposed to invest and 78,000 did not show any interest.Rising cost of education, healthcare and meeting other family needs are attributed to most of the bank linkage going towards consumption. The ultimate goal of financing through self-help groups is to improve the means of livelihood of poorer sections.To improve the entrepreneurial abilities we intend to provide them training through APITCO and ALEAP. One of the new initiatives is to make them take up selling of nutritional supplements like ragi laddu and other millet-based food, sprouts and selling ragi malt on the Beach Road, says UCD Project Director D. Srinivasan.TrainingTraining to some groups had already been given by the Home Science Department of St. Joseph's College here. The idea is to sell the nutritional supplements in educational institutes.Another activity is introduction of health workers on the lines of barefoot doctors in slums after capacity building through Red Cross. They will basically check blood pressure and sugar count so as to increase health awareness among people.SHG members run units like small provisions stores, pan kiosks, tailoring units and other petty businesses to earn a living.The target is to promote at least 20,000 units to improve livelihood this year, says Mr. Srinivasan.This year the bank linkage is expected to be between Rs.250 crore and Rs.270 crore.The SHG women have to meet the cost of the units through the bank linkage given to the group which is shared equally by the group members.New entrepreneur development programmes proposed for the groups"

Though the farmers were able to weed out the trees from agricultural lands, they quickly grow back since they are found in abundance in government lands and water bodies, farmers M Murugan and N Palanisamy pointed out.Farmers said that they were ready to clear out the trees on the government lands and pay the government a price for the trees cleared. A tonne of karuvelam firewood costs 3,000.Another invasive weed found in water bodies is 'athalai' (pink morning glory) bushes. Administration should take efforts to remove this particular weed also, farmers demanded.At the meeting collector K Veera Raghava Rao informed that crop loans availed by 25,467 farmers from 183 primary agricultural cooperative societies to the tune of 129.81 crore were waived as per state government order. If any farmer's name has been left out, they could approach their concerned society before September 2, the collector added.""This year, crop loans to the tune of 7.35 crore has been disbursed to the farming community. Through copra procurement centres functioning at Melur, Kottampatti and Sholavandan , the district administration has procured 482 kg of copra from coconut farmers,"" he stated.The farmers also placed the demand for uninterrupted power supply in delta districts.There were also complaint against the National Cooperative Sugar Mills at Alankanallur as the sugar factory is yet to distribute 450 per tonne out of the minimum support price of 2,750 to cane farmers.There were also complaints about lack of buses from Usilampatti to Mattuthavani since a good number of sick people took the trip to reach the Government Rajaji hospital at Goripalayam .

It was in February this year at Rajahmundry railway station that the gold being smuggled in the form of granules concealed in the compressor of a water dispenser, was found in the possession of a person travelling from Siliguri to Chennai.Officials of the CPD-Kakinada conducted the raid and seized the valuable commodity with the help of Railway Protection Force (RPF) on a tip-off.In terms of the number of cases, cigarettes that originated in foreign countries (FOC) topped the list. A total of 29 cases involving FOC worth nearly Rs.33.30 lakh were booked during the year and the seized commodity was destroyed as per norms.Besides, cases were registered for violating the Customs rules in importing raw sugar and for smuggling iron scrap and waste oil.Most of the seizures were in the purview of the CPCs Shore Guard Prevention Units (SGPU) at Kakinada and Machilipatnam, according to official sources.Of the 36 cases booked , 16 were in the jurisdiction of Kakinada Custom House, 10 in Machilipatnam SGPU and five each in Kakinada and Narsapur SGPU.RPFs cooperationThese are the places through which foreign cigarettes and other commodities are smuggled.

""Nearly 21 per cent of the entire debt (Rs 26,71,600 crore) of 507 companies in our sample had interest cover of less than 1x as of March 2016,"" Icra's senior group vice-president and co-head for corporate sector ratings Subrata Ray said in the report.Around 65 per cent of this debt with interest cover less than 1x belongs to companies in three sectors - infrastructure & construction, power and steel, he noted.""The slow pace of improvement in structural challenges in the infrastructure sector, the global commodity meltdown and anemic trends across domestic consumption-driven sectors continued to be the highlights of corporate performance during 2015-16,"" said the Icra report.Sectors like metals, especially iron & steel, witnessed sharp contraction in coverage indicators during the year as earnings were adversely impacted by a decline in steel prices as well as competition from cheaper imports.The pressure on debt-servicing indicators in the infrastructure and construction sectors also remained unabated, owing to continuation of structural challenges and limited improvement in balance sheet strength.Among the most stretched sectors, airlines and sugar saw however an improvement in interest coverage due to favourable industry-specific developments.From the profitability perspective, 2015-16 was relatively better for as benign commodity prices benefited most sectors, even as earnings of metal companies, especially steel, contracted sharply during the year.""The Ebitda margins for our aggregate sample of 507 companies improved by 70 basis points to 17.3 per cent in the year,"" Ray said.Margins expanded more in the second half of the fiscal as earnings of the consumption-driven sectors benefited from the volume uptick during the festive season.Margins of the commodity-driven sectors also stabilised with marginal recovery in international commodity prices and imposition of minimum import price, the report said.Ebitda margins expanded by 120 basis points on year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of the fiscal.Some of the key sectors which witnessed improvement in margins on account of lower input cost during the year included airlines, auto, power, FMCG and tyres, it added.

After remaining stable at 36,000 per tonne in September, sugar prices increased to a new high of 36,500 per tonne in October.Supported by an expected decline in the sugar production during the 2016-17 sugar season (October-September), actual decline in the domestic sugar stocks during the 2015-16 season, and a global sugar deficit scenario, which drove up international sugar prices, prices are still ruling high.Sugar prices are likely to remain firm in the next 3-4 quarters given the tight supply situation in the domestic market, analysts tracking the sector said.Prices have surged by 15.9% since March this year. Sugar prices have been on an uptrend since hitting a three-year low of 23,000 per tonne last July. Sugar production is estimated to have declined 11% to 25.2 million tonnes in 2015-16 season.Ratings agency ICRA expects domestic sugar production to decline by about 8% to 23.2 million tonnes during the 2016-17 season.This is largely on account of lower cane availability in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to poor monsoon rainfall last year.Although the monsoons are better this year, the impact on the cane output would be seen only in the 2017-18 season as sugarcane is a long gestation crop.While sugar mills in Maharashtra and Karnataka are likely to benefit from the rising sugar prices and the stagnant cane costs, cane pricing in UP, which is yet to be fixed for the 2016-17 season, will be crucial for the sustainability of the profitability for the UP-based sugar mills going forward.The union government imposed sugar stock limits in April this year in order to boost availability of sugar in the open market and help control the price rise. The limit on stock holding was approved for a period of six months and fixed at stock limit of 500 tonnes and a turnover limit of 30 days for sugar traders in the country.In a recent notification, the government has extended the limit for another six months i.e. till April 2017.""The extension of stock holding limits for sugar mills and traders by six months till April 2017 is unlikely to have any significant negative near term impact on sugar prices,"" ratings agency ICRA said.""This move in conjunction with earlier measures such as imposition of a 20% export duty on sugar and withdrawal of incentives on sugar exports is likely to however restrain any further hike in the near term,"" said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice president, ICRA."
