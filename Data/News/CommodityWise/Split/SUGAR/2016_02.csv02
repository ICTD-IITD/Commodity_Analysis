FILE PHOTOThe government is considering banning futures trading in chana dal (brown chickpeas) and reducing import duty on sugar as part of its efforts to rein in inflation, according to a top official.Higher food prices, led by pulses and sugar, pushed wholesale price inflation into positive territory in April after 17 months of decline while consumer price inflation crossed 5 per cent in the same month.The ban in futures trading in chana dal would be discussed at a committee of secretaries meeting on Monday but a final call would be taken by the finance ministry, the food ministry official said. Urad and tur are not part of the futures trading market while chana dal is and its prices have been rising. We will take a decision on putting curbs in futures trading after inter-ministerial consultations.The finance ministry would have to decide on this, the official said.VAT exemptionSeparately, to curb the surging prices of pulses, Union Consumer Affairs, Food and Public distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan requested state governments to exempt them from VAT (value added tax) and other local levies as it could help bring down prices by five to seven per cent. States have also been asked to rationalise stock limits for millers, producers and importers based on a logical formula linked to the consumption pattern.Prices of food items like pulses, sugar, edible oil seeds shoot up abnormally due to hoarding, profiteering and carteling by traders and middlemen  without any benefit to the farmers.Traders hoard the stock of a commodity in a bordering state where stock limits are not imposed, the minister pointed out, urging all states to impose stock limits in such commodities.Sugar pricesMr.Paswan warned sugar producers and hoarders of a crackdown if prices dont correct soon and reminded them that the government had helped the sugar industry when it was in distress and now that the sector is profitable, prices need not be as high as the Rs.49 per kg prevailing now.According to our needs, there is enough sugar but attempts to initiate hoarding have begun and sugar prices are being pushed up. We will think about reducing the import duty on sugar if this trend continues. The sugar price shouldnt be higher than around Rs.33 per kg, Mr. Paswan said after a meeting with state food ministers.State watchThe minister has written to the chief ministers of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, asking them to keep a close watch on sugar mills stock position to ensure availability in the domestic market.Responding positively to states suggestion that the Centre must also monitor the stock position of pulses importers, Mr.Paswan said, We dont want to bring in an inspector raj for this but the government must know the actual position.Higher food prices pushed wholesale price inflation into positive territory in the month of April"

""So it gave me great latitude for creativity.""Astonishing inventiveness quickly became Herme's trademark.He married unlikely ingredients and fillings such as olive oil and vanilla, or wild rose hip, fig and foie gras to exquisite effect, insisting that sugar should be used as a ""seasoning and not a principal ingredient.""Instead, his famous laboratory near Parc Monceau in central Paris works on the intensity of taste, turning out such classics as the ""Ispahan"" -- made with raspberries, lychee and rosewater -- and the ""Mogador,"" a sublime combination of passion fruit and milk chocolate.- 'Dior of desserts' -Despite his mother's protestations, Herme apprenticed himself to the great Parisian patissier Gaston Lenotre at the age 14 before leaving to join the rival house Fauchon a few years later.Having spent the 1980s developing his art -- during which time he also worked for Laduree, famous for its pastel-coloured macarons -- he went out on his own in 1997.The following year, he opened his first shop in Japan, and soon his creations were becoming objects of conspicuous consumption, often given as presents in beautifully designed boxes.Herme insisted constant experimentation is the root of his success.He begins each new creation with a drawing and by writing out the recipe, often inspired by ""something I have tasted, something I have read or maybe an image,"" he told AFP.He then calls in his team of patisserie chefs who work in his laboratory, which is housed in the 19th-century Parisian mansion where he has his office.But not all of his ideas are successful.""For example, we worked on a pear and chestnut macaron. But after three attempts, we had to admit that we were never going to make one that had both the true taste of pear and of chestnut at the same time,"" he said.""So I decided to make a chestnut one and a pear one and sell them together.""Herme, 54, who keeps all the notes from his experiments in his archive, is also a longtime collaborator with artists and perfumiers, including Jean-Michel Duriez, the ""nose"" of the Rochas brand of perfume.The French artist Nicolas Buffe has decorated his new chocolate boxes with drawings in his ""fairytale Manga"" style.Although Herme long ago expanded into tarts, cakes, chocolates and jams, the core of his business remains macarons, which cost 2.10 euros ($2.36) each in his Paris boutiques.""I consider the creation of pastries as an Art with a capital 'A'... just like music, painting or sculpture,"" Herme proclaims on his website.And the ""Dior of desserts"" also rejoices in the revival of high-end patisserie in France, which he has to some degree inspired.""There are more and more talented patissiers out there opening shops and doing great things in hotels and restaurants. The profession is very much alive and there are lots of people eager to learn, which is wonderful,"" he said.""Twenty years ago when you said that you wanted to be a patissier, people would say, 'Really?'"" Herme added.""From the age of nine I wanted to be a patissier. My mother tried to talk me out of it, but it didn't work.""alm/fg/oh"

However, the delay in implementing the order by cooperative banks has put farmers in the delta region in distress.Due to this delay, farmers who had taken loans in 2007-2008 are still adjudged defaulters and are not eligible for new loans from the cooperative banks. The farmers are ready to take up kuruvai cultivation for which they rely on crop loans from the same banks.""If the process for loan waiver had commenced soon after the CM's announcement, the problem would not have arisen. Without getting any official communication from higher officials, the heads of cooperative banks are unable to identify beneficiaries of the waiver and make it public,"" said Trichy district secretary of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam Ayilai Sivasuriyan.The chief minister had also allotted 40 crore to provide 4,000 as 100 per cent subsidy to those involved in mechanised cultivation process under systematic rice intensification (SRI) method in the special package for kuruvai due to uncertainty over the release of water in the Cauvery on June 12. However, farmers say that the amount will not be enough to meet the needs of all farmers taking up kuruvai this year.""The subsidy of 4,000 per acre is a meagre amount. Loans alone can save them. Besides the defaulters, fresh applicants also cannot avail of the loan now. This will force them to take loans from private banks,"" said state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam N Veerasekaran in Trichy who recalled a similar situation when the DMK government announced waiver of loans in 2006.Farmers were able to get around 23,000 loan for paddy and around 50,000 for sugarcane from cooperative banks. Now, they expect 30,000 for paddy and 60,000 for sugarcane.Besides the paddy farmers, sugarcane farmers have also been affected by the delay. ""It is a bad time for sugarcane farmers who are in debt after the delay in payment from sugar mills. Now, the cooperative banks have also delayed the loan process citing the waiver.

Maharashtra continues to be the dark spot , recording the highest number of farmer suicides . Punjab, which recorded only three farmer sucides in 2014, was second in the list in 2015 as also so far this year. However, MP, which has consistently been recording farmer suicides in varying numbers till 2014 , managed to escape this tragic cycle. The state did not report any suicide in 2015 and during the first three months of this year. Officials credit MP's better agricultural growth, backed by creation of irrigation infrastructure in water-stressed areas, for the turnaround. Water-starved Maharashtra faces the brunt for its failure to adapt to suitable cropping patterns, particularly Marathwada.In response to a Parliament question, the government informed the Lok Sabha that of the 2,115 farmers who committed suicide in 2014, 1,163 were driven by debt, and the remaining by crop loss.In Maharashtra, 857 of 1,207 farmers who committed suicide did so due to debt burden, which lays bare their dependence on local money-lenders due to a non-functional farm credit system in the state and also in other parts of the country.The figures for farmers' suicide were shared on a day Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh alleged that dams were constructed in Maharashtra to serve interests of the sugar industry and not farmers. ""I demand a discussion on Maharashtra drought so that facts can come to light,"" he said in Lok Sabha, blaming the previous Congress-led government in the state for the mess. His allegation triggered a war of words with the opposition blaming the Centre for not doing enough to provide relief to the drought-affected states."

Irrespective of age, none can escape those boils, prickly heat, red rashes, summer acne, sun tans, fungal, bacterial and viral infections erupting on the skin.Summer skin problems are irritating and painful and can severely affect one's daily routine, especially if left untreated. Some of the skin ailments are also contagious and can spread from one person to another in case of physical contact. Medical experts speak about the symptoms, treatment and preventive measures for summer skin problems.It's the infants and the elderly who are more susceptible to summer boils as their immunity is low and they have poor thermoregulation (amount of heat loss from the body through sweating) and skin being more sensitive.Speaking about the symptoms, Dr SV Satyaprasad, consultant dermatologist at Suraksha Health Park said, ""Boils are usually bacterial. Redness and swelling mark the affected area and can be painful. They appear on face, hands, lower and upper back and head and can spread to the entire body. Fungal boils are marked by itching, reddishness and spreading borders while heat boils and fever blisters are viral in nature. A KOH or Potassium Hydroxide test helps diagnose the type of boil besides clinical examination. Without delay, doctor should be consulted if one suffers from such summer skin ailments and on no account should one go for self-medication as the treatment and drugs vary according to the nature of boils.""Summer boils and skin rashes can also be prevented to some extent with alternative system of medicine. Some of these can be used externally or internally and most of these can be made ready at home.Ayurvedic doctor A Suryanarayana Patnaik said, ""Drinking lukewarm milk with little raw turmeric powder added to it has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, boosts immunity. Barley water with sugar added to it is also helpful in preventing summer skin ailments. Eating raw onion with lunch or breakfast items gives a cooling effect and may prevent boils and sunstroke. Another remedy against boils, itching and sunstroke is a mixture made of one cup of rye, one cup of curd and nine cups of water with little salt, curry leaf and jeera powder added. To get rid of prickly heat and body odour, daily put 20-30 neem leaves and juice of half a lemon in a bucket of water with a little salt added to it. After keeping it for half an hour, one can take bath in that water.""Avoid exposure to direct sunlight between 11 am-3 pm as heat index and ultraviolet radiation is the highest during that timeWear comfortable cotton clothes and cover the head while going outDrink lots of room-temperature water and fluids like butter milk, tender coconut water or water mixed with a little sugar and salt.

Officials say rivers are the state government's property that makes well digging in the riverbed illegal. The river has water only for a couple of months during the monsoon season.Once the Godavari dries up, villagers start digging temporary wells. Residents say it is inexpensive to dig wells in soft riverbed. A dozen wells have been dug in the river's stretch passing through Samvatsar and more are coming up. Pipelines criss-cross the riverbed as residents use them for their cattle and sugarcane crop.""Our crops are dying and so are the cattle. We have dug hundreds of bore wells inside our village, but there is no water,'' said Sopan Chavan, a resident. ""We are digging wells in the Godavari because there is no other option. Nobody pays any attention to our needs, so we have found our own way to get water.''Chavan pumps water for his sugarcane crop, which dominates the village's economy and politics. Most villages in Ahmednagar face acute water scarcity, but it has had little impact on 22 sugar mills that have crushed sugarcane this year. The high water-consuming crop is ever popular among farmers and politicians.Another resident, Rashid Tamboli, said some officials visited the village a few days back and told them well-digging in the riverbed is illegal. ""But the entire village ganged up and demanded that the government first make water available and then stop us from digging wells.'' Vimlabai Wandle said the water was not potable. ""It is not even safe for cattle, but it is better that they die drinking some water instead of dying without it,'' The water from the river wells stinks.""At least there is some water and that is enough for us. Nobody would like to dig the riverbed, but the drought is forcing us to,"" said farmer Vitthal Parmeshwar. Residents in nearby Lasur have built a well with concrete wall in the Shivna riverbed. Residents use a dry stretch of the river to go to nearby villages. ""There is regular traffic across the riverbed now and we have a huge ground to play in it,"" said Tushar Khurasane, 13. But he wants to see the river with water. ""Rivers have fish. The water is blue and there are birds. I have seen such rivers in my textbook.''"

The Centre announced that it is looking at importing pulses from Myanmar as India stares at a huge gap between demand and domestic availability. ""If the private players are not importing enough, then we have to take the necessary steps to reduce the gap,"" food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.In 2015-16 crop year, production of pulses is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes while demand is pegged at 23.5mt. Even after imports by private firms, the country is staring at shortage of about 18 lakh tonnes.Soaring food prices, particularly pulses, vegetables and dairy products, has been the key driver of both retail and wholesale price inflation.Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 5.8% in May from previous month's 5.5% increase. The food price index jumped 7.6% in May from April's 6.4% year-on-year increase.The increase was led by a surge in price of pulses and products, which shot up 31.6% in May while sugar and confectionery prices rose 14% year-on-year.Prices of protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish also firmed up, exerting pressure on overall numbers.Prices of vegetables jumped 10.8% year-on-year in May .""The three steps decided at the meet will be taken immediately. Though price of pulses is comparatively little less than last year, we are taking necessary steps. States must also do their bit, put their demand to get pulses from the central buffer stock,"" Paswan said.He said the Centre is ready to provide unmilled pulses at subsidised rate to states and they must sell the processed dal at not more than Rs 120 per kilogram. In recent weeks, prices of arhar and urad have touched Rs 170 and Rs 196 per kg respectively . The food minister said that prices of no other food item was discussed at Tuesday's meeting.""Prices of tomato and other vegetable increase for a few months because of seasonal issues. But we must understand that the prices differ from place to place and that can only be addressed when we have common agriculture market enabling farmers to sell their produce according to their choice,"" Paswan said.In fact, prices of tomatoes across the country showed wide variation with 1 kg tomatoes costing between Rs 20 and Rs 80. In cities including Kota, Nasik, Gwalior, Ludhiana, Meerut and Bhopal, tomatoes were retailing between Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kg and in Surat and Thiruvananthapuram 1kg tomato cost Rs 80. In the case of potatoes, while the average price was Rs 15 and maximum Rs 35 a kg, the key kitchen item was selling at less than Rs 10 in Nashik and Indore.Congress on Wednesday slammed the Centre for ""unprecedented"" inflation, saying there was ""highest-ever surge in food prices"" while the Modi dispensation was busy spending crores of public money on its second anniversary bash. Party spokesman Ajay Maken said food inflation at 7.55% in May had hit a 21-month high."

And, there is this talk of his diabetes and the possibility of his blood glucose having plummeted to dangerous level (hypoglycaemia). Did he have a cardiac arrest because of hypoglycaemia?Hypoglycaemia-induced risks are immediate, unlike the long-term ones linked to hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose level). When blood glucose dips to very low level, it can cause cardiac arrhythmia, says Calicut Diabetes Forum secretary S.K. Suresh Kumar.If a diabetic already has a heart disease, the risk from hypoglycaemia can be fatal, he says.Wary of the risk of end-organ damage from high blood glucose level, diabetics would adhere to a strict diet and exercise regimen. But, do not force this on elders, especially if they are on insulin. They can quickly slip into hypoglycaemia. Therefore, they should not be forced to achieve the ideal HbA1c (the three-month average) level of 7, he says.As for younger diabetics who exercise well and eat less, they must be warned that hypoglycaemia can set in six to seven hours after the exercise. If such persons hit the gym in the evening, they run the risk of a dip in sugar level while asleep past midnight. Dr. Suresh Kumar also warns that frequent bouts of hypoglycaemia will lead to the body adjusting to it and will, therefore, stop providing the warning signs. This is when the stage of hypoglycaemia unawareness sets in.This is a very dangerous stage because the collapsing can happen any moment.The public should be made aware of hypoglycaemia so that they can help a diabetic in distress with quick administration of anything sweet.(Reporting by K.V.

58f5c38c7be9e01a357a6f14,Just 15% water left in 91 major reservoirs,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Just-15-water-left-in-91-major-reservoirs/articleshow/52803420.cms,2016-06-18,"NEW DELHI: The slow progress of the monsoon has meant water storage in 91 major reservoirs has dipped further and overall availability stands at just 15% of capacity. This has not only hit initial kharif sowing but also availability of drinking water.Though the area under kharif will increase once rains sweep the entire country over the next few weeks, the current water shortages have shrunk the total area under rice, pulses, oilseeds and other crops, except sugarcane. As on Friday, the sown area under kharif crops was 10% less than that in the same period last year.Water levels in key reservoirs dipped from 26.81 billion cubic metres on May 26, to 23.78 BCM on June 16.With water levels in key reservoirs already at worrying levels, the situation could turn desperate if the monsoon fails to pick up in the next four-five days.Reservoirs in south India are the worst affected. Central Water Commission figures, released on Friday, show that water availability in 31 reservoirs in the south was 4.86 BCM on June 16  just 9% of capacity.Comparatively, the situation in the north is much better with water levels in the region's six major reservoirs at 23% of capacity.Of the 91 big reservoirs monitored by the CWC, 27 are in the west, 15 in east and 12 in central India.Besides supplying drinking water to many cities and providing water for irrigation, 37 of these 91 reservoirs have hydropower facilities with installed capacities of more than 60 MW.The total kharif sown area stood at 84.21 lakh hectares on Friday as compared to 93.63 lakh hectares at the same point last year. Surprisingly, the sown area under water-guzzling sugarcane as on June 17 was higher than its acreage last year  signaling farmers' preference for the crop that invariably gives better returns than pulses and oilseeds. In fact, sugarcane has already occupied more than 50% of the total sown area.The NDA government's move to substantially reduce the dues of sugarcane farmers in the past two years also seems to have played a role in tilting the cropping pattern in favour of sugarcane. About 87% of the dues have already been paid for the 2015-16 season, indicating how the crop remains remunerative despite delays in payment by sugar units.The country had recorded monsoon deficits of 12% and 14% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Though it is normal for water bodies to deplete sharply in the pre-monsoon summer months, the CWC has been keeping a close watch on the storage in these reservoirs so that the available water can be distributed properly till the arrival of monsoon.Most of these reservoirs get water during the June-September southwest monsoon, while reservoirs in Tamil Nadu get water during the October-December northeast monsoon.Reservoirs being monitored by CWC include Gobind Sagar (Bhakra) and Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh, Thein in Punjab, Rana Pratap Sagar in Rajasthan, Panchet Hill in Jharkhand, Hirakud and upper Indravati in Odisha, Ukai and Sardar Sarovar in Gujarat, Koyana and upper Vaitarna in Maharashtra etc."

Elango, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that the Subramania Siva Cooperative Sugar Mill provided Rs. 2,919 as cane procurement price per tonne, which was the highest by a sugar factory in the State. Besides, the mill also sanctioned Rs. 100 as transport subsidy to the farmers.Mr. Elango explained that government provided drip irrigation and micro irrigation subsidy to the cane farmers and called upon them to take advantage of the same to increase the cane area. The officials inspected the vermin compost unit set up from the subsidy provided by the Agriculture Department. Kavitha, managing director of the Subramaniva Siva Cooperative Sugar Mill, explained the achievements of the mill. Due to the good cane yield, the mill is expected to achieve 100 per cent capacity this season."

It is estimated that the drought destroyed at least 30% of sugarcane crops, leaving lakhs of farmers in a precarious position.As Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh face major drop in production due to drought, the Karnataka government has also revised its estimates to 30% less than 2015-16 harvest. However, Sugarcane Farmers' Association president Kurbur Shanthakumar says the dip in sugarcane production will be worse.""The drought has been severe this year; 50% of the crops have already been lost. There is no water for the crops to survive,"" he said. According to Shanthakumar, of the 25 lakh borewells drilled by sugarcane farmers, at least five lakh have dried up. And the operational ones are not yielding enough for the water intensive sugarcane crops.While the last three years saw a problem of plenty, with prices of sugar crashing, this year the sugar prices are likely to go up due to shortage. Farmers say sugar prices will touch Rs 45-50 per kg from the present Rs 30-35.""The production has come down by 18%. The next year's production, which is dependent upon this year's crop, will see a possible dip,"" sugar commissioner MK Aiyappa pointed out."

There is the community's intellectual property attached to that product.Earlier this year, seven other products - Ajara Ghansal rice, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri Kokum, Vengurla cashew, Lasalgaon onion, Waghya Ghevda, Mangalvedha jowar and Navapur tur - were awarded the GI mark.""Most of these products are from rural areas. Their qualities and traditional stories make them special. They are all natural products,"" Great Mission Group Consultancy, Pune, chairman Ganesh Hingmire said.As most of the GI products are from villages, an export market is created for these areas. Moreover, farmers are benefited by this process after they register as authorized users.Hingmire said Rashtra Krishi Vikas Yojana, former agriculture commissioner Umakant Dangar and the Centre had been instrumental in getting the GI marks.The custard apples from Balaghat, Beed, were awarded the GI for sweetness coming from the Total Soluble Sugar value, which is more than the apples found in UK and US. The fruit's speciality is that it grows even in rocky and waterless areas.Jalana's sweet oranges stand out for their size, sweetness and juice content. They are also one of the most vital crops for farmers in the area.Jalgaon's Bharit Brinjal is grown in parts of north Maharashtra, sharing its border with Gujarat. It's production was started by an old tribal community. As of today, the brinjal is served as one of the dishes on German airlines, especially Lufthansa.Waigaon's turmeric is grown in a small village of Wardha district, which is rich in curcumin content. The curcumin content gives medicinal qualities to turmeric and makes it useful for treating cancer. The standard curcumin content in turmeric is 2-4% by weight and anything over 6% is considered good. A 6.24% by weight curcumin content was found in Waigaon's turmeric by the Spice Board of India.Solapur's pomegranates contain more anti-oxidants than any other variety, which help in fighting cancer causing agents in the body.Figs from Saswad, Purandar, stand out for its size, colour, taste and high iron content. Moreover, it grows on red soil, which adds to the natural benefits.The golden-green Sangli raisins melt in one's mouth and has less wrinkles on the outside, which adds to its taste.Beed's custard apple, sweet oranges from Jalna, Jalgaon's Bharit Brinjal, Waigaon's turmeric, pomegranate from Solapur, figs from Purandar and raisins from Sangli have been issued certificates of Geographical Identification (GI) mark.The Agricultural Geographical Indications (Agri GI) has given these certificates to these produce that are being cultivated by generations of growers from these areas.Earlier this year another set of seven products were awarded this mark. They includec Ajara Ghansal rice, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri Kokum, Vengurla cashew, Lasalgaon onion, Waghya Ghevda, Mangalvedha jowar and Navapur tur.A geographical indication (GI) is a name or sign used on certain products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (eg a town, region, or country). There is the community's intellectual property attached to that particular product.""Most of these products are from rural areas and it's their unique qualities, and the traditional stories behind them, that make them special. They have a history and are all natural products,"" says Ganesh Hingmire, chairman, Great Mission Group Consultancy (GMGC), Pune.Securing a GI for a product helps the community in getting a premium price. Since most of these are agricultural products from villages, an export market is created for these places and leads to spurt in international demand for them. Hingmire says that support from Rashtra Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Umakant Dangar, former agricultur commissioner and the Union government have been instrumental in getting these GIs.These products have been given GI's for either their nutritional, or scientific importance for which they will now be recognized at the national level. The ultimate beneficiaries of this whole process are the farmers who will now have to get themselves registered as authorized users to be able to avail of the benefits.The Beed custard apple comes from Balaghat and has got the GI for its sweetness that comes from the Total Soluble Sugar (TSS) value which is more than the apples found in UK and US. This apple grows on rocks. The specialty about the Beed custard apple is that it grows even in rocky, water less areas as that is the suitable atmosphere to grow them.Jalana sweet oranges stands out from the other oranges because of their size, sweetness and juice content. They are also one of the most important crops for farmers from the area.Jalgaon Bharit Brinjal that grows in parts of north Maharashtra that shares its border with Gujarat is a natural gift the production of which was started by an old tribal community. The brinjal is now one of the dishes served in German airlines especially Lufthansa. The seeds of this brinjal ooze oil while cooking which adds a particular taste to the dish that makes it different from the rest.Waigaon turmeric grown in a small village of district Wardha is rich in curcumine content. A high curcumine content of 6.24 was found in a report presented by the Spice Board of India. It is the curcumine content that gives medicinal qualities to turmeric. This also renders it useful for treating cancer and to be used as a direct food supplement. The standard curcumine content in turmeric is 2-4 and anything over 6 is considered good for the product to be used as a direct food supplement.Solapur pomegranate contain more anti-oxidants than other pomegranates. These anti-oxidants help in fighting cancer causing agents in the body.The Saswad Purandar fig stands out for its size, colour, taste and high iron content. Moreover it grows on red soil, which adds to the natural benefits that can be reaped from it.The golden green coloured uniform sized Sangli raisin melts into the mouth and has less wrinkles on its outside, adding to the taste."

But at Colmorod-Navelim on Friday, the organizers of the 3rd 'O Re Sao Joao 2016' sought to revive Goa's traditional sport of taabla by staging a mock war between the ladies of Colmorod ward and those hailing from the neighbouring Ratwaddo ward.Ultimately, amidst the loud shouts of 'bicchu', 'tableu' or 'tablam', the Colmorod Ostad's team defeated the Ratwaddo Giants team bagging a traditional prize of 25kg of sugar whereas the runners-up bagged 15kg of sugar.This traditional sport called tableu, tablu, tablam or tablani nd is played amidst a lot of noise and great gusto with the feverish pitch of the player's voices reaching a crescendo no sooner victory is in sight.This game requires not just skill but some luck, too, whilst tossing the four stout six-inch long two-inch in diameter wooden sticks (tablam) that are painted black with some markings on the flattened end across a rope or string tied in the middle of the playing arena. The two teams sit diagonally facing each other as play progresses anti-clockwise with all players taking turns to toss the tablam.The game has to start with tableu which means when the four tablam are tossed, three of them have to fall with the flat-painted black surface facing upwards and the team gets another chance to toss the tablam. So until the tableu is obtained, the team cannot open its account. If all four tablam fall with their flat black-painted surface facing upwards, the score obtained is bara (12). But if all the four tablam fall with their rough side facing upwards, the score obtained is aat (8).If only one of the tablam is with it's flat black-painted surface facing upwards while the rough surface of the other three tablam are facing upwards, then the score is teen (3) and if two of the tablamhave their flat black-painted surface facing upwards, then the score is don (2).The duration of each match is approximately 25-30 minutes, informs veteran player Shivolkar, who adds that traditionally prizes awarded to the winners were either sugar, rice or alcohol and that it is only recently that cash prizes are being awarded for tournaments of this traditional sport."

According to rough estimates, a sugarcane cultivator would get Rs 85 per tonne extra than its earlier price of Rs 1,875.As a routine practice, the MSC bank decides valuation of sugar from time to time, which is used as bar for trading. Based on the valuation, the factories calculate their income and release sugar stock in the market.The 2015-16 sugarcane crushing season got over in April. The MSC bank then decided to undertake valuation of sugar stock in the state.A meeting was held in the second week of June where the valuation decision was taken. It was finalised in the last week and the bank's managing director Pramod Karnad made it public thereafter.He said the current trend is to purchase sugar as per requirement. ""There is no sale for stocking or just because the prices are low. Moreover, poor rains in last two years has made the overall economy sluggish,"" he said.The state is already facing arrears to the tune of Rs 918 crore to sugarcane cultivators from co-operative as well as private sugar mills.Among the co-operative mills that owe sugarcane farmers money include Tatyasaheb Kore Warna mill (almost Rs 32 crore) controlled by former state minister Vinay Kore of Jan Surajya Shakti Party. The Sangli-based Vasantdada sugar mill controlled by Vishal Patil, the brother of former Union minister Pratik Patil, owes almost Rs 27 crore.Moreover, several factories under the Bhaurao Chavan umbrella controlled by former chief minister Ashok Chavan owe Rs 28 crore."

D Samsons Cold Drinks house on the Mumbai-Alibaug road is one such non-monument to history, which tells the story of Alibaug's amazing connection with Jews and with Israel. With its Mangalore-tiled roof and Marathi signage, this could be any other vada-pav or cold drink stall, if it weren't for the Star of David and pictures of Moses that hang on the wall. This quaint beverage stop, which serves an array of delicious bespoke aerated drinks like ginger-lemon soda, ice-cream soda and masala soda, was founded 80 years ago by a Bene-Israeli Jew, Daniel Samson Digodkar.Like many of his brethren  at one time there was a population of several thousand Jews in this area and a synagogue still stands tall in Alibaug town  his first name, Daniel, attests to the Jewish heritage, while the surname acknowledges his village, Digodi, near Mandwa. This intermingling of names reflects the manner in which the Raigad Jews have comingled Marathi culture with their very particular rituals, dissolving like sugar into water  in this particular case, carbonated water.D Samson's cold drinks, once a favourite among the British collectors, are by now legendary in the area. ""We continue to use the same secret recipes and the same carbonating machine that my uncle started with all of five rupees,"" says his nephew Sydney David, who lives in Mumbai but returns every Sunday to oversee the family business. Most other members of his family have migrated to Israel.For the longest time, the Bene-Israelis of Alibaug ran rice and oil pressing mills. When the Digodkars' mill shut down, Daniel Samson pursued a personal passion  creating flavourful drinks, first with the marble inside the bottle to contain the bubbles, later with sealed caps. When he died, his sister Mary Moses David took over. Her son Sydney is one of the last in the family - indeed in the community  left here today.According to Jewish author and historian Esther David, there are very few written records about the Bene Israel community of Alibaug. ""It is said we were a seafaring tribe who arrived more than 2,000 years ago, after facing persecution in the Greek or Roman empire. The ship happened to wreck at Navgaon in Alibaug district. Seven couples survived and spawned a community that mostly ended up as coconut oil pressers and supari plantation owners. Because they continued to practice Shabbath and took Saturdays off, they became known as 'Shanvar-telis'.""A little over 100 years ago, the community built the Magen Avot Synagogue (which means Shield of the Fathers) in the Alibaug, with the prayer hall facing the west, with eyes on Jerusalem. ""At one point there must have been 50,000-60,000 Bene-Israelis in western Maharashtra. During the British rule, they started moving to neighbouring cities like Pune and Mumbai, but the highest concentration remained in Alibaug,"" says David.Everyone was raised with the belief that they would eventually make it back to the Promised Land. By the 50s and 60s, most people started leaving for Israel, forming a little India in south Israel, where they continued to wear saris and create spice markets, but lived under the aegis of a new state which prided itself on embracing Jewish refugees not just from the Holocaust but from all over the world.One of the last of the Jews left in Alibaug is the elderly Jacob Dandekar, who has served as a chazan or cantor at the Synagogue and is widely referred to as 'Rabbee Dandekar', the Marathi version of Rabbi. The oldest Bene Israel cemetries continue to lie in Alibaug and the Israeli government has built a monument there in memory of the original seven couples who landed there and kept the community alive, says David.As for D Samsons Cold Drinks, it may not be around very long. The family of the current proprietor's is not interested in the business. His son works in a media company in Mumbai and his daughter has joined Israel Airlines and already been through the military training that is a must for all young people. Many have asked for the formula that makes these drinks the ultimate delicious quenchers, but he guards it fiercely - and it may well remain one of Alibaug's many charming and forgotten secrets."

58f5c9eaa3d24b0b70c24ba1,Why can’t they let a good tale be?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/why-cant-they-let-a-good-tale-be/article8665263.ece,2016-05-30,"All Ive been hearing for some time now is how fabulous the Jungle Book film adaptation has been weeks after its release. And I am annoyed because I didnt quite take to the earlier animation film either. From what I hear of the current one, it looks like my cribs are going to continue. Now, before you jump down my throat, let me state that Im not a film person and even more so when a film is based on a book.Take the grand-mommy of all those books-to-movies transitions: Gone with the Wind . My mother was ready to disown me when I turned up my nose at Clark Gable. Too smarmy and oily, I said. Or King Solomons Mines . I saw two versions and neither had much to do with the book. I suppose, a man searching for his estranged brother wasnt good enough for the screen.I didnt watch any of the Lord of the Rings movies but I heard all about them. A practically non-existent romantic angle was played up and that was good enough for me to boycott them. Same for the Harry Potter series.I had my son  who is not a book person  give me a scene-by-scene description of each movie. So which of these was not in the books, ma? he would ask. I havent yet figured out if he was making fun of me or was really serious about plumbing these differences. Why cant they let a good tale be? Why add, subtract, multiply characters till you dont know what the hell is going on?And now you have The Jungle Book . My first gripe: its The Jungle Books  there are two of them. The Mowgli stories account for eight of the 15 tales. Theres much more to the books than a boy brought up by wolves. Theres Kotick, the white seal; Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, the inquisitive mongoose; Toomai of the Elephants; Kadlu, the Inuit and his husky, Kotuko. Oh, theres lots more! And each story is followed by a lovely poem. How about a movie on any of those? On second thoughts, lets leave them well alone.But to come back to Mowgli, since thats what the movies are about. What irritated me most about the earlier animated film  which Ive seen, as against the current one that I will not  was the treatment of Kaa and Hathi. How could they caricature the two most dignified creatures in the books? Kaa is reduced to worrying about his sinus and knots in his tail, instead of being the menacing creature that both Baloo and Bagheera step carefully around. Hathi is not a major character in the recent film and was reduced to a pompous military-minded nut in the earlier film. But, in the books, he is the Master of the Jungle. Everyone, including Shere Khan, treats Hathi and his three sons with circumspection.Finally, theres Mowglis return to the man village. Theres no young girl making eyes at him. Instead, it is a story of pain; of a move made with much sorrow. The tale ends with Mowgli sobbing on Baloos shoulder, unable to leave; not walking off behind a wide-eyed little girl.However, with both The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins , I saw the movies first. But after I read the books  Maria von Trapps autobiography and PL Travers eight-book series  I just couldnt deal with a sugary-sweet Julie Andrews. Not when both the women she portrayed were so different. In her autobiography, Maria von Trapp writes of how she married the Captain more for the kids sakes. Later, one of the von Trapp children spoke of her being a controlling woman prone to rages. Where were the Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens? Mary Poppins was no Spoonful of Sugar either. She is a cross nanny who keeps the kids in line through threats. Even worse, everyday things  stuff like furniture  take on slightly sinister aspects.Looking back, I realise that the books taught me something valuable. I didnt quite get it as a kid, but now I think it is the most important lesson: that most people  even those who care for you  will let you down. But youll get over it and get on with your life.But still, give me the books any day."

And instead of putting a lid on your budget, it is in the process of burning a big hole in your pocket.Since May, oil companies are blending 10% ethanol (ethyl alcohol) with petrol to decrease India's dependene on oil import and reduce carbon monoxide by up to 30%. ""However, wrong practices and absence of precautionary measures is not only defeating the purpose but slowly damaging car engines,"" said city-based auto-emission consultant Somendra Mohan Ghosh.Ethanol is highly hygroscopic, which means it has the ability to attract water molecules from the environment and hold them either through absorption or adsorption. Since the air in Kolkata is very humid, the absorption level of E10 - commonly known as Gasohol - is very high. ""When it reaches a saturation point, ethanol releases water and they 'Phase Separate', forming two distinct layers. So in the fuel tank, there are actually three layers - water, ethanol and petrol. This phenomenon causes multiple problems in car, including high level of emission,"" said Professor Prabir Basu , former director of NIT and an automobile engineering expert.The problem has left petroleum dealers hassled. ""We are receiving complaints from consumers. They are accusing us of malpractices or supplying inferior gasoline. They are not supposed to understand the intricacies of the problem. In fact, oil company personnel came and brought out buckets of water from the tanker,"" said Kaushik Ganguly of Sunbeam Petrol Pump on Sarat Bose Road. He said that the Petroleum Dealers' Association has already protested against the problem.""Ethanol-blended gasoline is supposed to be sold to vehicles with superior emission mechanism, like those complying with BS-IV emission standard. However, in reality, it's being sold to all vehicles, irrespective of their compliance to different emission standards. You can have serious and even catastrophic engine problems, without warning,"" Ghosh added.According to him, ethanol is not being blended at a depot level - and not at the refinery or at supply point - while being loaded at fuel tankers. This is the time when it is absorbing moisture from the air. From the tanker, it is being flowed into petrol pump tanks. Finally, the gasohol is being dispensed into car fuel tanks. At every stages, ethanol in the petrol comes in contact with the air and every time it absorbs water droplets.However, oil companies are defensive about the practice. ""This may be new in Bengal . But we had introduced it in UP and Maharastra long ago, we had no such problem. May be the water in present in the tanks of petrol pumps. But we must check out and take necessary action, if required,"" said deputy general manager Amitav Mazumdar , deputy inspector general (operations), Indian Oil.Petrol is turning into water, literally. Introduction of E10 (Ethanol blended Gasoline) during the monsoon is playing havoc with your car engine. Of late, you might have noticed a greater number of knockings in your car engine or sudden stopping of engine. It is all because of high water content in petrol you are buying. As a result your car is ending up polluting more.Since May, oil companies are blending 10 per cent Ethanol (Ethyl Alcohol) with Gasoline (Petrol). The mixture is called Gasohol. Gasohol is useful in decreasing the India's dependence on imported oil, and reduces the carbon monoxide emissions by up to 30 percent. Ethanol is available in abundance with sugar manufacturers.Ethanol is highly hygroscopic (the ability to attract water molecules from the surrounding environment and to hold them either through absorption or adsorption). Since the air in Kolkata is highly humid, with humidity often shooting to 99 per cent, the absorption of water vapour is very high. ""When it reaches a saturation point the Ethanol and water will Phase Separate, actually coming out of solution and forming two or three distinct layers in the tank. This phenomenon causes multiple problems for car, including high level of emission,"" said Professor Prabir Basu, former director of NIT and an expert of automobile engineering.In fact, the petroleum dealers are clearly hassled.

The letter terminating his three years contract did not mention any reason. However, minutes of the IIT-BHU Board of Governors (BoG) meeting revealed that the decision was taken because members felt that Pandey's classroom teaching was against national interest, pro-Naxal, may disturb communal harmony and encourage students to take law into their hands. He was also accused of committing cyber crime by posting link of banned BBC documentary of Nirbhaya rape case. The action was taken on the complaint of an MA political science student, Avinash Pandey, who was not related to any course Pandey taught in the IIT.Pandey was hired by the IIT-BHU in August 2013 for the period of three years to teach subjects - control systems, process instrumentation and human values. He introduced a subject `development studies' after getting it duly approved as a humanities option at BTech III.Pandey, who is a Gandhian, challenged the BHU order in the HC on February 5, 2016. He pleaded that the IIT-BHU BoG resolution has cast stigma and serious allegation of 'anti-national' on him, that too without providing him any opportunity to respond or explain.The BHU lawyers said that the services of the petitioner were terminated as the rules and regulations and that Pandey was not a fit person to be associated with the university.The BHU counter affidavit filed in reply to the petition said that Pandey organised group discussions on the topic like `Killing of Mohd Akhlaq justified', 'beef eating', 'beef ban', 'should religion be a matter of personal faith', 'killing a rationalist: silencing reason', 'killing of Prof MM Kulburgi, Naresh Dabholkar and Pansare', 'Atmosphere in the country is suppressing people's freedom of expression' and 'Preparation of political speeches' among other were either political or against the national interest.It also said that the decision was taken to maintain peaceful atmosphere on the campus as the petitioner was polluting the academic atmosphere of the institution as he was serving sugar quoted poison by his e-mails and articles.However, court rejected arguments while quoting Voltaire who famously said ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to death your right to say it"".The bench also questioned the motives of the IIT-BHU administration for dismissing Pandey without giving him an adequate hearing. ""In the present case, the order in question has to be accepted as stigmatic/punitive one for the simple reason that here petitioner has been not only accused of committing cyber crime but has also been accused of imparting teaching contrary to national interest,"" the order said.The court also said that though the petitioner employment was on contractual basis, it is clearly reflected that the decision was taken because of differences of ideologies. Heavy words such as commission of cyber crime and acting against national interest have been loosely used by the BHU administration while taking the decision, it said.The court said that the academic administrators should be politically neutral, at the point of time of dealing with academic and administrative matters of the university.Recalling syncretic vision of BHU founder Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, the court said ""The (BHU) Founder's vision has been as follows - India is not a country of Hindus only. It is country of Muslims, the Christians and the Parsees too. The country can gain strength and develop itself only when the people of different communities in India live in mutual goodwill and harmony. It is my earnest hope and prayer that this Centre of life and light which is coming into existence will produce students who would not be intellectually equal to the best of their fellow students in other parts of the world, but will also live a noble life, love their country and be loyal to the supreme ruler."""

""For the last three years, I am concentrating on medical research on issues like de-addiction and affordable treatments for lifestyle diseases through my India Healthline mission,"" Togadia told reporters here on Saturday. He also plans to open a wellness centre on the 10 acres donated by city real estate tycoon Praful Ghadge at Sonegaon in Butibori. This should be operational in a year for residential solutions to healthy life, he added.Togadia is in the city to attend the state-level two-day meeting of the VHP that started on Saturday at Reshimbagh. Togadia, though from Gujarat, is a rabid critic of Narendra Modi. Apparently, he has been put on leash by the RSS these days. He refused to utter a word against Modi and his government.""Right now people's health is my priority and I am working in that field to create awareness through a huge network of Health Ambassadors and over 3,000 doctors who have joined India Healthline to give voluntary services,"" he said. He claimed as per WHO and London School of Economics reports on India, 40 crore Indians suffer from lifestyle diseases, and are already spending $236 billion (Rs14 lakh cr) on medical treatment. ""If remedial steps are not taken urgently, the number of patients may double in next 20 years and the spending may touch Rs120 lakh crore. This will lead to collapse of Indian economy and not enough doctors, hospitals, nurses will be available to handle such a crisis,"" he said.India Healthline offers free medical advice to poor and needy through a helpline 09167016183 and 1860233666. A network of lakhs of ambassadors would be trained to carry out tests and given instruments to check blood pressure and sugar levels so that people get timely help. Togadia said 80% of Indians cannot afford or do not bother to have a medical check-up. Besides de-addiction drops, he also claimed to have developed and marketed glucometers and cheap blood sugar measuring strips at Rs8 a piece to replace imported ones costing Rs26.The India Healthline has a 6Ds mantra for good health: 1. Decide (that you want to live healthy and disease-free), 2. Diet (only 5 GM salt is needed per day by a body but Indian consume 6 to 12 GM, so cut on salt intake drastically), 3. De-stress (avoid stress, 4. Detoxify (through daily exercise), 5 De-addiction (from tobacco, alcohol which are main causes of cancer), 6 Do it Now (all the five above)."

Retailers are currently selling sugar between Rs 30 and Rs 35 per kg.The government on Friday issued the Maharashtra Scheduled Commodities Wholesale Dealers Sugar (Storage Control) Licensing Order, 2016, which applies to the entire state and will be in effect till October 25, 2016. The order forbids a wholesale dealer from holding stocks of sugar in excess of 5,000 quintal, while the limit for retailers is 500 quintal. Also, a dealer cannot hold the specified quantity of sugar for more than 30 days after receiving it.The Centre had issued an order last month directing all state governments to take necessary steps to control sugar prices. We have followed orders from the Centre and issued a stocking limit for the state. It is to keep prices under control as sugar cannot be held back to create artificial scarcity, a senior official with the states food, civil supplies and consumer protection department said.Sugar factories, however, feel setting a stock limit will not be useful. Sugar production is on the decline this year, so I am unsure whether this order will have any impact, Sanjeev Babar, MD, Maharashtra State Co-Op. Sugar Factories Federation Ltd, said. Officials confirmed that there has been a drop in sugar production in the state in the last two years, and production in the next year is expected to dip .In 2014-15, sugar production was 105 lakh tonne, which came down to 83 lakh tonne in the 2015-16 fiscal. The next crop is expected to be only 45-50 lakh tonne with the drought-like condition prevailing since three years taking a toll.The area under sugarcane cultivation too has reduced by over 3 lakh hectare and is expected to shrink further. Last year, the total area under cultivation was 9.27 lakh hectare; this has come down to 6.30 lakh hectare this year.Shirish Deshpande of the Mumbai Grahak Panchayat said such measures will have a very limited effect. Despite imposing a stock limit to tur dal, prices which had gone up are yet to come down. Those who want to sell in the black market can devise various ways [to do so], so it is not a foolproof system, he said.Mr. Deshpande also questioned the sudden rise in sugar prices. Except for last year, we had excess sugar production. There was sugar stock which could have been used to control prices. It must also be probed as what led to sudden rise in sugar prices, he said.The Centre's order last month directing all state govts to take steps to control sugar prices"

""Morning alarm,"" says homemaker Premlata Sharma.From the rooftops of some colony homes, where government servants live, the view of the Jawahar Bagh is clear. Colony residents recall how the orchard gradually became home to protestors who conducted morning marches, peddled vegetables, spices, clothes and utensils at throwaway prices, who had solar panels, tractors, generators and ran their own kitchen.The squatters raised cattle, owned an atta-chakki and went to makeshift toilets. A witness said that though their huts looked ramshackle, they had neat interiors. SUVs such as Safaris and Fortuners drove in and out.Initially there were only a few dozen occupants but the numbers swelled to thousands. ""A bunch of 30-40 came on March 15, 2014. I heard they had permission to stay a couple of days. But they never left,"" says Premlata.She remembers the date because the next day was Holi. ""Slowly they grew in numbers and their behaviour changed for the worse. They menacingly pointed towards us with lathis and warned people to get off rooftops,"" she remembers.Another homemaker Kanchan Yadav says the squatters spoke a different language, not the local brajbhasha. ""They seemed to be from east UP,"" she said. Some were from Lakhimpur Kheri, or Balia and Ghazipur. A few were from Jhansi too.Sometimes the interaction between the squatters and the colonywallahs was positive. ""Once when they sold sugar for Rs 20 a kg, there were queues of buyers.""The occupants eventually had to wage a lengthy court battle with the district administration for the orchard. Things spun out of control on Thursday; two policemen, including an SP, and at least 22 squatters died.Witnesses claimed the shots fired by the occupants were accurate because they were aimed from trees where they had a clear view of the police.

The trend came amid studies that linked aspartame to cancer.But now American consumers appeared willing to mix up their artificial sweeteners, according to the company.PepsiCo said it will use aspartame in its reintroduction later this year of Diet Pepsi Classic Sweetener Blend and PepsiMAX as PepsiZeroSugar.Diet Pepsi, its main diet cola brand in the US, will remain sweetened with sucralose and Ace-K, it said.Aspartame and sucralose are approved for human consumption by the US Food and Drug Administration.In late 2014, Coca-Cola launched Coca-Cola Life, its first reduced-calorie soft drink sweetened with cane sugar and stevia leaf extract, a natural herbal sweetener.lo-vs/sstPEPSICO"

A source in the state intelligence said that Sudhakaran has reached Jharkhand and he is engaged in reviving the party and motivating the armed squads.IG operations and police spokesperson M S Bhatia said the police intelligence gathered over a period of time in the recent past has confirmed the movement and activity of Sudhakaran. The police are ,however, clueless about his location.In 2011 when the Maoists were considered stronger than the police, Jharkhand had reported a total of 517 Maoist incidents. In 2015, only 310 incidents were reported. The police have penetrated into Maoist strongholds and killed many of them. Certain areas where the security personnel feared to tread in the past, are today home to fortified security camps housing heavily armed CRPF personnel.Beside running anti-Maoist operations, the CRPF men have won many hearts in the rural areas through civic action programmes and developed a rich network of informers. All this tilted the balance against the Maoists who lost several cadres to gunbattles. Many Maoists have also left the organization.Jharkhand-Bihar's top Maoist leader Dev Kumar Dhan alias Arvindji is reportedly unable to give the organization the effective leadership he provided half a decade back. Old age and blood sugar has taken a toll on his health. Another leader Nishantji is also old and getting increasingly infirm.Sudhakaran, around a decade younger to them, will not have difficulty running through the dense forests and scaling the mountains unlike his seniors. He will also apply the guerilla tactics which caused the rise of the extremists in Andhra Pradesh. The Andhra Pradesh guerilla tactics are likely to create trouble for the police in Jharkhand.A police officer speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Maoists are changing their strategy to compete with the advance technology the security personnel are trying to combat guerilla warfare. ""Unlike before, they now prefer small groups for movement and refrain from using mobile phones for communication. It has been planned at the top level and is being implemented in field,"" he said.Police claim, the Maoists are on the backfoot but they often manage to hit security personnels.Bhatia said the state police would develop a proposal for reward on Sudhakaran. ""We are looking into the possibility. Rewards are there on the heads of top Maoist leaders of Jharkhand,"" Bhatia said."

According to state government records, a total of Rs 1,684 crore has still not been paid to farmers by sugar millers, most of them in private sector.The promise of payment is also expected to impact farmer families in West UP's Shamli district and its neighbouring regions, where the BJP made a failed attempt to inflame passions by claiming large scale exodus of families due to communal tensions. While the district administration disproved the BJP's claims of exodus on religious lines, local leaders confirmed that families have migrated from Shamli in general, and Kairana in particular, for economic reasons. The bulk of the population in the district depends for its livelihood on agriculture and allied activities.Akhilesh's promise to get cane dues settled impacts Shamli because three private sugar mills -- among the highest defaulters in making payments to sugar cane farmers -- are located in Shamli and Muzaffarnagar districts.A senior official in the UP Cane Commissioner's office confirmed that while private mills owe farmers a total of Rs 1554 crore in the current fiscal, the state-backed cooperative sector needs to settle dues of Rs 130 crore. Five private mills have also not settled payments worth Rs 67 crore for the sugarcane they purchased from farmers in 2014-2015.According to the Cane Commissioner's office, the Samajwadi Party government has, so far, settled outstanding payments of Rs 13,140 core to sugar cane farmers this year. The UP government has also made budgetary grants in order to maintain the prices of sugarcane when sugar prices crashed across the country. This year alone, UP government set aside a grant of Rs 1336 crore for settlement of cane dues.Welcoming the government's decision to ensure payment of arrears to cane farmers, Shamli resident and member, Planning Commission , Sudhir Panwar said, ""The migration of both Hindu and Muslim families in Shamli and Muzaffarnagar is largely triggered by economic causes. With agriculture income decreasing steadily, most people left home in search of better incomes outside of their home districts. This announcement by the CM is a welcome decision that will not only stabilise the economic conditions of farmers, but also curb migration."""

But sugar prices, which were hovering at Rs 30 a kg last October have crossed Rs 40 a kg last week. With Maharashtra, a key sugarcane growing state hit hard by drought, all-India sugarcane output is predicted to fall 10 per cent in 2016, according to a report from credit rating firm ICRA.""Last year was for consumer promotions, with price-offs, bundling, freebies and adding extra weight to packs.

Excise duty on sugary aerated drinks was hiked to 21 per cent from the existing 18 per cent in the Budget this year.

Around 20,000 litres of milk of dairy farmers, procured from Bheden and Barpali area of the district, was rejected on Thursday.The milk was allegedly rejected because of their poor quality, sources said, adding that they had tested the quality when they procured the milk from the route. ""They did it deliberately,"" said Sureswar Satpathy, president, Bargarh Zilla Dugdha Utpadana Chasi Sangha. He added that Omfed was earlier procuring around one lakh litres of milk from the district, but it has curtailed 30%of the procurement. Around 70,000 litres of milk are being procured from the district now. They are also regularly rejecting thousands of litres of milk on various pretexts. The milk farmers are incurring huge loss because of this attitude of the Omfed, he said.General manager of Samaleswari Regional Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited, an Omfed subsidiary, K K Naik said they didn t procure the milk after it was tested positive in the adulteration test. It is not a new thing. We have also rejected 1000 litres of milk on Wednesday, he said, adding, We have discussed with the farmers on the issue. No restriction has been imposed on milk procurement. We returned the milk because of adulteration. We have advised the farmers to supply milk without adulteration.Omfed managing director Bishnupada Sethi said the Sambalpur Milk Union returned 5,941 litres of milk after testing for adulteration. During the test, the union found the milk mixed with sugar and salt coming from different milk societies to Bargarh chilling plant. Some people blocked a milk tanker coming from Barpali and opened the valve by breaking the seal and drained out the milk. We have directed Sambalpur Milk Union general manager to lodge an FIR against the wrong-doers, he added.The conflict between milk farmers and Omfed started after the cooperative major wrote a letter on March 31 to the milk cooperative societies reduce milk procurement by 31 per cent. On April 4, a group of milk producers staged demonstration in front of the Jagatsinghpur collector office protesting the decision. On April 20, milk farmers of Puri district poured more than 800 litres of milk.On May 6, the milk farmers under the banner of Odisha Milk Farmers Association poured milk on the road in front of the state assembly protesting the Omfed move.The farmer leaders alleged that Omfed has stopped procuring around 2 lakh liters daily from 2.8 lakh farmers of the state. As the government has stopped buying 30 per cent of its total procurement of milk, farmers are facing distress sale. If it continues in the state, it will create a big problem in future, said association OMFA president Rabi Bahera.Omfed sources said it pays Rs 26.10 for a litre of milk. It purchases around 5 lakh liters of milk every day. But it couldn t purchase bulk production due to lack of its capacity, sources said."

Generally, sugar mills undertake works of water supply, drip irrigation and soil development that directly benefit farmers.Sachin Raval, regional joint director, sugar commissionerate, said, ""I have asked the factories that have not yet paid the entire sugarcane purchase price to complete the payment. The union government has come up with various schemes such as mandatory sugar export, direct benefit to farmers through subsidy payment. If the mills rush now, they can get good price for sugar and disburse the remaining payment to farmers.""There are some 41 cooperative and private sugar mills operational in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, which crush 20% of the state's total sugarcane. The dues in Sangli and Kolhapur are Rs 296.35 crore and Rs 773.77 crore, respectively.A delegation of some mills from Kolhapur and Sangli met Raval on Tuesday evening regarding outstanding amount of payment to the sugarcane cultivators. Raval held separate meetings for Kolhapur and Sangli as there was slight variation in the issues pertaining to sugarcane payment and outstanding amount.Sangli-based sugar mills had unanimously decided to pay Rs 1,900 per tonne of sugarcane as first instalment irrespective of the FRP calculation, while factories from Kolhapur had agreed to pay 80% amount as per the FRP formula. Hence, the due amount and its percentage varied in both the districts.Farmers' leader Raju Shetti had pressurised the state government to break the FRP payment into 80:20 formula, where sugar mills were asked to pay 80% amount of FRP as first instalment. The rates of sugar were very low during November to January; hence factories could make payment as per the formula.Meanwhile, the union government announced making sugar export mandatory and prices started surging. With price rise, government and farmers also started pressurising mills to release sugar for export as well as in domestic market and book profit so that it can make payment to farmers.Despite it, some factories refused to pay farmers as per the formula and are now facing action. The state government recently cancelled the licences of some sugar factories and suspended the licences of a few others for their failure to pay as per the FRP."

""My factory has scored well in terms of recovery and I had communicated to farmers that I would make the payment. But it got delayed by just one week. Still, the licence has been suspended,"" he said.The current average of sugar recovery in the state is 11.30%, while Gurudatta has reported 13.58%.Political pundits from Kolhapur pointed out that Ghatge's successful support to Ulhas Patil in winning the assembly election from Shirol could be a key reason behind the action.Shirol assembly segment was given to Raju Shetti's Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, a BJP ally. Though Patil was re-contesting from the constituency, Shetti fielded Anil Madnaik, who lost the election badly.In the meantime, another Kolhapur-based sugar mill Jawahar Cooperative factory has topped the state in terms of production.Jawahar Cooperative crushed 15.64 lakh tonne sugarcane and produced 19.78 lakh tonne sugar. Meanwhile, Solapur-based Vitthalrao Shinde cooperative sugar mill has crushed 16.07 lakh tonne sugarcane, which is highest in the state in terms of size, but it produced only 17.56 lakh tonne sugar.Though the sugar commissionerate has taken penal action against the sugar mills, they will apply for fresh licence before November 2016 for the next crushing season.The mills have to file a report that they have properly to their farmers then only then they will get licence for next crushing season.Last week, the state government cancelled the licences of six mills and suspended the licences of eight others. The government also imposed a fine of Rs 116.6 crore on six other sugar factories."

Developing drought-tolerant (less water-consuming) GM sugarcane is not an end in itself. We know how difficult it is in India to go for commercial release of any transgenic crop,"" said an ICAR scientist.Citing the recent example of GM mustard, sources claimed that even positive reports based on field trials and bio-safety examinations of the crop could not get this transgenic variety - developed by a Delhi University institution - green signal.But the effects of back-to-back droughts, mounting rural distress and the sheer economic and ecological costs of water-intense crops might make planners keen to develop GM sugarcane. Authorities hope that once the benefits of the new crop become evident, its acceptance will grow.The final call will be that of the central regulator - Genetic Engineering Appraisal Co- mmittee - of the environment ministry. So far, GM brinjal hasn't been allowed commercial release even after the regulator's nod whereas a similar transgenic variety is being cultivated by Bangladesh.But GM sugarcane in water-stressed areas can offer hope in Maharashtra and other parts of India. Already, extreme water shortages have turned the focus on how to use water judiciously with PM Narendra Modi calling for all out efforts to implement drip irrigation on a massive scale.Referring to the urgency, an ICAR scientist said the GM route could be a long-term approach, keeping in mind the global demand scenario and India's role in it, whereas drip irrigation was the need of the hour.The research body, nevertheless, appears to be preparing for the future. ICAR director general Trilochan Mohapatra had last month written to Pawar while apprising him of the work done by ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute in Coimbatore in the field of GM sugarcane and how it could join hands with VSI, Pune. Pawar is chairman of the board of trustees that manages VSI.Responding to Pawar's letter on the issue, Mohapatra said an MoU was ready to be signed between ICAR and VSI."

""(MoT) does not support the proposal of DoFPD for exemption of wheat from the perview of JPM Act,"" the note to DoFPD is learnt to have concluded.Jute industry contributes Rs 8,000 crore annually to eastern India's rural economy, estimates say. The main states affected would be West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam and Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh.When asked about the proposal on limiting jute bag packaging, Bengal MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy (TMC) told TOI, ""When CCEA has approved norms for compulsory packaging of minimum 90 % food grains and 20% sugar in jute bags, how can food ministry propose to the SAC a total exemption of wheat from the purview of the JPM Act. It is an evil design or conspiracy of the plastic lobby and unfortunately the food department has fallen prey to it. Also, government should put a permanent ban to packaging food in plastic which is unhygienic and non-biodegradable. If Bangladesh can do it why can't we?"""

The irrigation department had released water from Nilwande dam in the district to cater to drinking water needs.Prohibition orders were issued by the district collector along the riverside. However, farmers in Nimbale and Kolhewadi constructed a bund across the Pravara river to block water and use it for their villages and for their crops.Last week, irrigation department officials who arrived with machinery to break the bund, faced the farmers' ire. They were pelted with stones, but the officials demolished the bund the next day. Farmers are agitated after cases were filed against them.In Solapur, farmers in Karmala taluka blocked Ujani dam's water between Kittur and Pomalwadi, and downstream, farmers have started an agitation demanding the release of water. Tension prevails in all these villages.In Satara district, MP Udayanraje Bhosale has threatened of a 'violent agitation' if the irrigation department didn't stop the flow of Urmodi dam water to neighbouring Sangli district.""People in Satara have given their lands for the dam and they are the ones reeling under water scarcity. The local people must get first priority in water supply. If the demand is not met, be prepared to face action on the ground,"" Bhosale has warned.Meanwhile, the water level in Koyna dam in Satara is depleting. ""As of now, 11.81 TMC water is available in the reservoir. The government may decide to reserve this water for drinking purpose. Power generation may come to a halt if the monsoon is delayed,"" an irrigation department official said. The monsoon is expected in the state by June 7.The overall water availability in the state's reservoirs is 12 per cent and 4,600 villages and 7,418 hamlets are dependent on tankers. The government provides water to these parched areas using 5,738 tankers.Activists and experts have reiterated their demand, against the backdrop of Bombay high court's observations, for immediate release of water from Tata dams and the Koyna hydroelectric project for regions downstream. According to the activists, Tata dams hold a total of 159 million cubic metres (MCM) and Koyna has 536 MCM of water.The court had recently observed that, ""Natural resources such as water is national property... these resources must not be diverted for other purpose.""Sanjay Lakhe Patil, social worker from Jalna, has filed a contempt petition against the state for allegedly not releasing water despite a high court directive, this month.The bench said since it was not an expert on technical aspects, the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority should constantly monitor water levels in all the dams of the state and ensure that enough water is available for drinking in the drought-hit areas.Lakhe-Patil's contention was that private dams, including six in and around Lonavla, which have 50 TMC water and was being held, ought to be released to the affected areas in Marathwada."

Both are water guzzlers. Even as the government has tightened the screws on sugar cane farmers, the Central Citrus Research Institute (CCRI) has issued a warning that unless orange growers too shift to conservative forms of irrigation, the fruit crop might take a hit as depleting water table will only reduce the precious resource.Excessive drawing of water to irrigate sugarcane is being cited as one of the reasons for the current drought in Marathwada. The government is now insisting that even sugarcane be watered using drip irrigation methods as it requires ten times less water than flood irrigation.Even though a vast majority of the orange growers have shifted from flood irrigation to drip irrigation in past few years, uneven, erratic and scanty rains over the last two-three years has led to a big fall in the groundwater table.The water levels in wells have gone so low that farmers are finding it difficult to maintain their orchards alive as most of them don't have enough water for even drip irrigation.Farmers planning for ambia bahar orange crop, which bring fruits to the market from October to January, are worried at present as less rains in July last year and high temperatures in March and April this year are bound to reduce the production by at least 20-25%. Hence, the CCRI is suggesting both immediate as well as long term water conservation techniques to orange farmers.CCRI director MS Ladaniya says that due the ever-increasing demand for irrigation, water table depletion is bound to continue even if there is a good monsoon. ""Orange growers need to be more judicious with water use. Even for drip irrigation, the water requirement is huge. Hence, unless farmers adopt water conservation methods, the problem is going to worsen,"" he said.Principal scientist from the soil and water conservation division of CCRI, Rajeev Marathe stressed that orange growers must water their orchards depending on its soil quality.""Several farmers still use flood irrigation technique for orchards. They fail to understand that keeping the roots moist is enough and there is no need for more water,"" he said.Meanwhile, farmers continue to insist that the government needs to support them with better policies. ""Farmers have been switching to drip. But government doesn't pay the subsidy amount in time. The majority of farmers haven't got it in the last two years,"" said Manoj Jawanjal, a director with Mahaorange (orange growers' association).Raju Kotewar from Ladgaon village in Katol tehsil, Suresh Tatode from Narkhed tehsil in Nagpur district, Rahul Choudhari from Warud tehsil in Amravati districts too told TOI that despite drip irrigation the water tables in their areas had gone down substantially. ""Orchards of 80% farmers in my neighbourhood are dying. Either there is too much rain or there is untimely rains. Too much rains doesn't get converted into groundwater as it gets washed away. Discontinued rain too is harmful,"" said Kotewar.Senior geologist in Groundwater Surveys Development Agency (GSDA), Shivaji Padmane too agreed that the groundwater levels were depleting. But he said that the levels varied from place to place.The latest survey conducted by the agency in March showed a fall in the water table in eight out of the eleven wells in Narkhed tehsil and two out of the five wells being monitored in Katol tehsil. ""But there was a rise in levels in three wells in each tehsil too,"" he said.CCRI'S WATER CONSERVATION TECHNIQUESLong term:Short term:1. Watersheds2. Check dams3. Rainwater harvesting1.

58f5dc6aa3d24b0b70c257fd,The low-carb debate,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-low-carb-debate/article14986595.ece,2016-09-18,"A few years ago, Dr. Richard Kahn, the now-retired chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, was charged with organising a committee to prescribe a diet plan for people with diabetes. He began by looking at the evidence for different diets, asking which, if any, best controlled diabetes.When you look at the literature, whoa is it weak. It is so weak, he said in a recent interview.Studies tended to be short term, diets unsustainable, differences among them clinically insignificant. The only thing that really seemed to help people with diabetes was weight loss  and for weight loss, there is no magic diet.But people want diet advice, Dr. Kahn reasoned, and the association really should say something about diets. So it, like the National Institutes of Health, went with the Department of Agricultures food pyramid.Why? Its a diet for all America, he said. It has lots of fruits and vegetables and a reasonable amount of fat.That advice, though, recently came under attack in a New York Times commentary written by Dr. Sarah Hallberg, an osteopath at a weight loss clinic in Indiana, and Dr. Osama Hamdy, the medical director of the obesity weight loss programme at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School.Carb restrictionThere is a diet that helps with diabetes, the two doctors said: one that restricts  or, according to Dr. Hallberg, severely restricts  carbohydrates.If the goal is to get patients off their medications, including insulin, and resolve rather than just control their diabetes, significant carb restriction is by far the best nutrition plan, she said in an e-mail. This would include elimination of grains, potatoes and sugars and all processed foods. There is a significant and ever growing body of literature that supports this method. She is in private practice at Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital and is medical director of a start-up developing nutrition-based medical interventions.But there are no large and rigorous studies showing that low-carbohydrate diets offer an advantage, and, in fact, there is not even a consensus on the definition of a low-carbohydrate diet  it can vary from doctor to doctor.There have been debates for literally the whole history of diabetes about which kind of diet is best, said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, chief academic officer at Joslin, and no relation to Richard Kahn. But, he said, the answer isnt so straightforward.In support of a diet like Dr. Hallbergs, there is one recent short-term study, by Dr. Kevin Hall of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and his colleagues, involving 17 overweight and obese men, none of whom had diabetes. They stayed in a clinical centre where they ate carefully controlled diets. The researchers asked what would happen if calories were kept constant but the carbohydrate composition of a diet varied from high to very low. The answer was that insulin secretion dropped 50 per cent with the very low carbohydrate diet, meaning that much less insulin was required to maintain normal blood glucose levels.Since diabetes results when the body cant produce enough insulin, perhaps it is a good idea to reduce the amount of insulin it needs by eating very low carbohydrate diets, Dr. Hall said.Some longer-term studies, though, failed to show that low-carbohydrate diets benefited glucose control.Even if diets are effective in the short term, he said, the difficulty is adhering to the diet over the long term.In the short term, the low-carbohydrate diet sometimes does better on glycaemic control, he said. But as time progresses, the difference mostly disappears. What counts is which diet helps most with long-term weight loss.Issue of overall healthAnother issue with low-carbohydrate diets, researchers said, is the question of what will happen to overall health if diabetics actually follow the diet for years or decades. (Heart attacks are the major killer of people with diabetes.) Insulin levels may be better, but, said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, co-director of Columbia Universitys Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on lipoproteins and vascular biology could offset such a benefit. In other words, it is not clear if a lower insulin level would translate into fewer heart attacks.But multiple studies have found that when it comes to weight loss  the only proven way to help with blood sugar control over the long term  there is no difference among diets that restrict calories, fat or carbohydrates.Experts like Dr. David Nathan, director of the Diabetes Center and Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, advise dieting for people with diabetes. But, he said, when we advise people to be on diets, the major goal is to lose weight.What matters the most for controlling diabetes, Dr. Nathan said, is how much weight you lose.

This resulted in 67.42 crore litres of ethanol coming in during 2014-15 sugar year (October 2014 to September 2015).In the sugar year 2015-16, the government is hopeful of exceeding the 5 per cent target, sources said.Oil firms have floated tender for buying 266 crore litres of ethanol procurement with a view to meet 10 per cent blending target, they said adding more than 135 crore litres has been offered for the current sugar year.India consumes 2,800 crore litre of petrol and to meet 5 per cent blending would need 140 crore litre of ethanol.

Shyam Sundar Singh Nadar, the Madras High Court Bench here has quashed an order passed by Valliyoor Magistrate on July 27, 2010 permitting Radhapuram police to reopen the murder case, which was closed in 2009 since it could not be solved for long.Justice P. Devadass held that a Judicial Magistrate, who had accepted a negative final report filed by the police terming a case undetected, could not order its reopening.Such an order could be passed only by a superior judicial forum after setting aside the acceptance of final report.The judge also directed the Registrar (Judicial) of the High Court Bench to place his judgment before the Chief Justice for being circulated to all judicial officers serving in the State and the Union Territory of Puducherry since it contained some guidance on an important aspect of criminal law.According to the prosecution in the present case, an unidentified charred body was found on a private land at Singara Thope in Radhapuram taluk on August 26, 2007.The police initially registered a case under Section 174 (police to investigate suspicious death) of Code of Criminal Procedure and subsequently altered it to Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code.However, the investigating officer could not fix either the identity of the deceased or those who committed the crime for more than 18 months.Hence, a negative final report was filed on March 21, 2009 and the Magistrate accepted it.Subsequently, Muneerpallam police arrested a gang in connection with an Explosive Substances Act case in 2010.During the course of investigation, the police came to light that one of the gang members, S.S.S. Nadar (the present review petitioner), was also involved in the Radhapuram murder.The suspect reportedly confessed that they had abducted a person from Chennai at the instance of his gang member Baskaran and murdered him in Tirunelveli.Since Nadar reportedly told the police that the identity of the victim and motive behind the murder were known only to Baskaran, the police made an application before Valliyoor Judicial Magistrate and obtained an order for reopening the case."

The properties together are estimated to be worth over Rs. 100 crore. Officials said the property is being attached as part of the probe into the alleged Maharashtra Sadan scam and related allegations of money laundering against the ex-minister and his family.Senior officials said the agency will take possession of the properties after completing the attachment formalities. The ED has also attached a plot worth Rs. 160 crore in Khargar and a sugar mill and prime land worth Rs. 50 crore in Nashik. All properties were in the name of Bhujbals son Pankaj and nephew Sameer.The Bhujbals are facing two charges under the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) in the Mahrashtra Sadan case, which came to light after the PWD headed by Bhujbal had awarded the contract to his close associate, KS Chamankar. The contractor in turn sold the development rights obtained in lieu of the structure to a third party. The ED investigation revealed that Rs. 850 crore had been laundered in the matter.Reacting to court order, Pankaj Bhujbal said the family has full faith in the judiciary.

One such solution is the ambulatory glucose profiler, which works on a coin-sized sensor, and gives 1,400 readings.""You stick it on your upper arm for 15 days. The doctor can remove the sensor and pass it through a reader to get the readings and graphs,"" said diabetologist Dr V Mohan. He said technology was changing healthcare, and an example is how a device like Google Glass can give readings by scanning iris.It is not just monitoring, even drug delivery can be non-invasive. Insulin pumps, in existence for about three decades as an alternative to multiple daily injections of insulin, are being improved. ""Monitoring devices can be attached to these pumps to switch them on and off automatically. Prototypes of pumps that can manage high and low blood sugar levels have been developed,"" Dr Mohan said.On Tuesday, a company announced in Chennai an injectible drug that can delay a diabetic's switchover from tablets to insulin shots. Edgard Olaizola, MD, Lilly India, said the drug is the first injectible when a patient is not able to keep the sugar under control with oral medication. ""It has a molecule that mimics the effects of GLP-1, a hormone that helps keep the sugar level normal by helping the body release its insulin,"" he said.India has around 65 million diabetics. A paper published recently in Lancet found that 15.3% of adults with diabetes are from India. The paper, based on data from 751 studies, involving 4.4 million adults from 200 countries, showed that the prevalence of diabetes has increased 80% in women and more than doubled in men in the country."

The Bombay High Court made this observation while ruling that if a compensation claim by the dependents of an accident victim is rejected by one forum, the claimants cannot be denied the remedy of moving other competent forum.On May 4, the bench of Justice Mridula Bhatkar dismissed an appeal by the New India Assurance Company Limited challenging a July 31, 2013, order by the Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation in Kolhapur that granted Rs4.11 lakh as compensation along with 50% penalty to dependents of a 31-year-old tractor driver, who died in an accident on January 24, 2004.Prior to the claim proceeding before the Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation, a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) in Kolhapur had rejected the dependents' claim for Rs10.10 lakh compensation on September 6, 2007.The tribunal then held that the victim, Adhik Patil, was at fault for driving the tractor in a rash and negligent manner and that his annual income of over Rs40,000 did not qualify his dependents for compensation under Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act. Patil, who was employed by the tractor owner, was driving the sugar cane-laden tractor-trolley from Nigdi to Tawade in Shahuwadi taluka of Kolhapur district when an unknown truck hit the vehicle while it was negotiating a U-turn.In its appeal, the insurance company argued that the commissioner's order was not maintainable in law considering MACT's rejection of the claim filed by the dependents. A second claim under the Workmen's Compensation Act could not have been made as Section 3 (5) of this Act and Section 167 of the MV Act are corresponding provisions that impose restriction in terms of selecting either of the two remedies, the company argued. The proceeding before the commissioner was also barred by limitation law as the claim was filed in 2009 instead of within two years from the date of accident, it argued.The bench said, ""If the claim application is rejected on certain technicalities before one forum, then denying other forum will lead to depriving dependents of compensation for which they are otherwise entitled.. The sections cannot be interpreted in such a manner so that the object of the legislation will be frustrated.""The bench noted, ""It will be absolutely unjust to close the other option which is available to the dependents of the deceased. The employee-employer relationship is proven (for claim under the Workmen's Act). The claimants need money to survive. Ignorance of law is not a defence, however, the court cannot shut eyes to the realities and practical difficulties faced by the litigants."""

Newborns in India have high fat inside abdomen leading to higher risk of heart diseases from birth itself, according to a study.Findings of the cohort study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, show Indian children have less of muscle and more fat in their body as compared to many other places around the world. As a result, Indians are more susceptible to metabolic diseases.Doctors say the risk can be minimised if pregnant mothers keep their weight under check and the fat is not passed on to the newborn. Besides, presence of such fat in the body from birth enhances the importance of exercise and physical activity.""Indian newborns often carry extra weight and therefore, it is important for parents to encourage playing, physical activity and observe healthy eating habits,"" says Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis C-DOC Centre for Diabetes. He said abdominal fat is not only responsible for high blood pressure but various other heart diseases as well as insulin resistance and diabetes.""A susceptibility to metabolic diseases is associated with abdominal adipose tissue distribution and varies between ethnic groups,"" the findings of the study said, highlighting the link between body fat and heart diseases.It also showed that Indian neonates have more body fat than Chinese neonates.Another recent study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology had showed that women consuming food rich in fructose or fruit sugar levels can put their babies at risk of developing heart disease as adults.Cohort studies conducted in Europe have also found links between childhood abdominal fat and heart diseases with as many as 35.4% overweight children suffering high blood pressure there. In India, childhood obesity is reaching alarming proportions with around 22% prevalence rate over the last five years.According to Dr Misra, addressing obesity and overweight at school level is important to control the rising burden of cardiovascular diseases among adults.According to the World Health Organization, childhood overweight and obesity is rapidly increasing in developing Asian countries, including India.The number of overweight children in low and middle-income countries has more than doubled from 7.5 million to 15.5 million between 1990 and 2014. In 2014, almost half (48%) of all overweight and obese children under 5 years age lived in Asia and one quarter (25%) in Africa."

With every intake, the risk of obesity increases 1.6 times, they say.Nowadays, people prefer cold drinks over lassi, fresh juice, lime water or coconut water, which is a a worrying trend, said homeopathic practitioner Dr Dinesh Kumar. Aerated drinks contain high levels of carbon dioxide, caffein, sugar and artificial flavours, which pose many health hazards to the human body.Another medical practitioner from city, Dr Shailesh Dwivedi said that consumption of too many fizzy drinks puts you at an increased risk of liver cirrhosis similar to what effect chronic alcoholics have on human body.Besides, another harmful effect of soft drinks is osteoporosis. Talking to TOI, orthopaedic surgeon Dr KD Tripathi said too much cold drink consumption also leads to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a major health threat and experts say that the real culprit is soda's displacement of milk in the diet. Also, cold drinks dissolve the tooth enamel. Acidity can dissolve the mineral content of the enamel, making the teeth weaker, sensitive and susceptible to decay, said dentist Dr Sandeep Singh.Experts suggest using a straw to consume cold drinks, for it can prevent your teeth from its ill-effects."

The system has been cleansed. Now, there is no scope for private contractors to form cartels due to introduction of e-tendering,"" said the state's minster for water resources, Girish Mahajan. He was in the city on a tour to the region's irrigation projects. Water resources department has been in the eye of storm since last four years due to corruption allegations.Referring to the ongoing ACB probe into irregularities in awarding irrigation project contracts by the earlier government, Mahajan said so far only officials have landed in the dock and no politician has been touched yet. But this should not discourage those working in the department as even politicians will be facing the heat soon. At the same time, he said, investigation agencies should be allowed to take its own time so that no loopholes are left in the probe.Mahajan said approvals to cost escalations are also no longer a constraint for irrigation works and no project will be held up for want of funds. Cost hikes have been a touchy issue in the WRD due to the controversy involving former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who approved several escalations in one go.""The word cost escalation had become a taboo, but it must be realized that without a timely go-ahead to fresh estimates, projects cannot be completed. As everybody wanted to avoid trouble, even projects which had reached close to completion or where 50% to 60% of the work was done were stranded for want of approvals to fresh cost estimates. The new government has already approved escalations for 98 projects out of which 42 are in Vidarbha,"" said Mahajan. In case of Gosikhurd, however, approvals for cost escalations for works now under ACB probe will be held up till investigations are over.In the light of drought in Marathwada, the minister said it has been now decided to stop irrigation of sugar cane fields through allowing direct flow of water. Instead, farmers will have to use drip irrigation system.The drought has led to a debate on whether it was the water guzzling sugar cane crop which led to shortage of water in this region where rainfall is scanty. ""But sugar mills are a major industry,"" Mahajan said adding since sugar cane and other orchards need ample water, a policy decision has been taken that farms cultivating these crops in Marathwada will not be allowed direct water supply and only drip irrigation will have to be done.The minister said in order to prevent evaporation and seepage losses, it has also been decided to stop constructing canals. Instead, water will be transported through pipeline which will save losses up to 30% at least.On the total cost for irrigation projects, the minister said works to the tune of Rs 90,000 crore are underway throughout the state. So far, the average allocation for these projects has been in the range of Rs 7,000 crore to Rs 8,000 crore a year. At this rate, it may never be possible to finish the work in time and each year the cost will exceed. The department needs to infuse at least Rs60,000 crore in a period of three years to finish majority of the work in specified time frame. For this, there are plans to raise money though bonds or other borrowings apart from tapping other sources. The Centre has already promised Rs9,000 crore for 132 projects apart from the funds through Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchan Yojana, Mahajan said."

Now that I am better and walking regularly, I want to ensure that she too stays healthy,"" says Peswani.Whether it's signing up for runs or buying medical insurance, families in Chennai are working to ensure their domestic help remains fit and healthy. Especially since most of these women have little time, money or energy to take care of their medical needs.That's part of the reason why Peswani decided to take Hema along. All Pinkathon participants will get either a free medical check-up or a mammogram, depending on their age. ""I will be accompanying her to the hospital for the mammogram too,"" says Peswani, adding that she is thinking of signing up Hema's daughter for the run, which will be held on June 5 at Island Grounds.Working with the idea of inclusivity, Milind Soman, founder of Pinkathon, says ""We would like participants to support this idea by encouraging them to offer an experience to women who would ordinarily be left out like the household help.""Making medical treatment more accessible for his staff at home, IT professional Chandrasekaran Duraiswamy took medical insurance for his maid Shanthi eight years ago.

Banerjee, who had graduated from the local St Xavier's College, learnt flying after he shifted to the USA and got his pilot's license in 2005 and undertook some solo flights since then. The journey so far has been safe but not without hassles, Banerjee mentioned when asked about his experiences. While flying through the UK, Rebecca experienced malfunctioning in the magnetos and vertical trim tab and also got its left wheel pant damaged, he detailed."

BJP state president Raosaheb Danve will preside over the session at Balgandharva Rangmandir. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, minister of state for environment Prakash Javadekar will address the executive on Sunday.The meeting assumes importance as several BJP ministers have been mired in controversies. Notably, Eknath Khadse, former revenue minister, had to resign from the cabinet for his alleged involvement in purchasing MIDC land in the name of his family members. Controversy is raging over Girish Mahajan for allegedly ""forcibly"" buying a piece of land in 2002 to set up a sugar mill, a transaction not mentioned in his election affidavit.The opposition has also raised objections on guardian minister Girish Bapat's role in a dal scam. State BJP president Raosaheb Danve and minister of state for home Ranjeet Patil are being targeted for their alleged involvement in land transactions. Earlier, rural development minister Pankaja Munde had faced charges of corruption in distribution of chikki in state-run schools.A senior BJP leader said party leaders will discuss and debate all these issues as the image of the state government is being tarnished. ""The Centre is worried about the involvement of the ministers in various controversies. The chief minister will update party office-bearers on these developments. Likewise, a strategy will be planned. There is debate going on if Khadse should be allowed to attend the meeting,"" he said.

Picture used for representational purposesA decline in soil fertility, climate change and shortage of labour are some of the reasons that have led to the decline in sugarcane production in the State over the last few years.According to the Sugarcane Research Station in Cuddalore functioning under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), the production was 30,100 (in thousand tonne) in 2012-13 and 25,700 during 2013-14.Though there was an increase in the production between 2009 and 2012, the rate of produce could not be maintained due to various factors.The production was 29,746 (in thousand tonne) during 2009-10, 34,252 during 2010-11 and 35,309 during 2011-12.There are various factors for the decline in the sugarcane production. Decline in soil fertility, climate change and the need for high cane yield and sugar recovery varieties and non availability of pure seed are some of the reasons behind the decline in production, said R.S. Purushothaman, professor and Head of the Sugarcane Research Station.Labour shortage, escalation in the cost of cultivation and non-adoption of Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative, drip fertigation systems by farmers are also said to be the reasons.As for the diseases, red rot poses a major challenge for the farmers. Cane productivity in the State is dependent on excessive rainfall and drought which appear at regular intervals leading to wide fluctuations in output , he added.The Sugarcane Research Station, Cuddalore, has brought out 24 varieties so far to increase the production and sugar recovery.While new variety seed canes are supplied to farmers, the station also focuses to develop input responsive sugarcane varieties to improve efficiency of the crop."

The district guardian minister drew flak from different quarters for the decision to release 1 TMC water.Addressing a news conference here on Thursday, Bapat appealed to political parties not to politicize the issue and stop agitations. He said all stakeholders, including the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), were informed about the water release and there was no intention to ignore anyone. Water has started flowing through the Mutha canal from the Khadakwasla dam from Wednesday and is expected to reach Daund and Indapur in the next 12 days.The decision to release water drew criticism from the city mayor, civic activists and almost all political parties in PMC. They claimed that water cuts imposed for the past eight months had helped save more water in dams and hence it should be kept reserved for the city.Bapat said, ""We all should deal with the water crisis without a political agenda. Those who have resorted to agitation, I appeal to them to stop it. I can understand concerns about water availability. Even I have fought in the past to maintain enough supply of water for city residents. But nobody can stake claim on the water stock because the government decides its utilization according to requirements. The state government has given priority to drinking water and I assure that not a single drop of water from the city's quota has been diverted. No additional water is being released for rural parts. Both Indapur and Daund will receive 30% less water than the demanded quota.""Bapat said water for Daund and Indapur was released in February. The released water was expected to last for 90 days, till mid-May. But many sources went dry within 70 days, prompting the release of water again. The irrigation department conducted a detailed study of the water stock, after which the decision to release 1 TMC water was taken.Officials claimed that the city would not face additional cuts till July 15 because there was a proposal to use water from the dead stock in case of delay in arrival of rains.The city would require about 3.25TMC water till July 15. At least 1 TMC water is likely to remain unutilized around July 15 even after the city uses its quota.Warning against theftDistrict guardian minister Girish Bapat warned of strong action against those indulging in water theft.He said additional police force had been deployed to stop water theft for farming.Authorities have been told to confiscate suction motors and the power utility has been told to cut the electricity supply to motors.Various departments are working together to ensure water reaches the beneficiaries without any hassle."

Members of the ruling party, opposition, even independent and rival groups are competing against each other to dole out freebies in their constituencies.Each party member is spending between Rs. 7 to Rs. 10 lakh in distributing sugarcane, jaggery, sugar and rice. Of the 23 constituencies in Puducherry district, party members in at least 15 constituencies are pushing their chances hard to enter and win the upcoming elections. There is not much activity in the five constituencies of Karaikal, one in Yanam and Mahe.Approximately, a minimum of Rs. 7.5 to 8 crore is spent in view of providing freebies for Pongal celebrations alone in Puducherry.Some of these constituencies include Lawspet, Thattanchavady, Muthialpet, Orleanpet, Nellithope, Ariyankuppam, Kalapet, Villianur and Ozhukarai.In these fifteen constituencies there are at least 90 potential candidates to contest the upcoming elections, who are splurging away money to woo voters. Many of these constituencies fall within the town limit. This includes at least three rival candidates within All India NR Congress (AINRC) in each constituency, one from Congress, AIADMK and DMK.With a population ranging from 23,000 to 30,000 each constituency has at least 15,000 households. Black-stemmed sugarcane costing Rs. 10 each is bought and distributed free of cost. For this, a potential candidate is spending at least Rs. 3 lakh. These sugarcane are bought from Kallakurichi, Tiruvannamalai, Shankarapuram, Salem and Erode.Though the candidates acknowledge they are distributing sugarcane and other freebies, no one wants to reveal how much they are spending.Congress party member John Kumar in Nellithope constituency is advertising in a local television channel that he is distributing free organic sugarcane from his farm to every household, area and ward in this constituency. Congress State secretary P.M. Saravanan said he purchased 25,000 sugarcane from his father-in-laws farm to distribute in Muthialpet.Not just this, people in these constituencies is being flooded with calendars which cost Rs. 65 to Rs. 70. In addition to this, a kilogram of sugar at Rs. 35 is distributed to the households free of cost.Party members are also distributing induction cooker, vessels, rice and toor dal.The questions as to where do they get the money and who is accounting for these freebies still remains unanswered."

Generally, sugar mills undertake works of water supply, drip irrigation and soil development that directly benefit farmers.Sachin Raval, regional joint director, sugar commissionerate, said, ""I have asked the factories that have not yet paid the entire sugarcane purchase price to complete the payment. The union government has come up with various schemes such as mandatory sugar export, direct benefit to farmers through subsidy payment. If the mills rush now, they can get good price for sugar and disburse the remaining payment to farmers.""There are some 41 cooperative and private sugar mills operational in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, which crush 20% of the state's total sugarcane. The dues in Sangli and Kolhapur are Rs 296.35 crore and Rs 773.77 crore, respectively.A delegation of some mills from Kolhapur and Sangli met Raval on Tuesday evening regarding outstanding amount of payment to the sugarcane cultivators. Raval held separate meetings for Kolhapur and Sangli as there was slight variation in the issues pertaining to sugarcane payment and outstanding amount.Sangli-based sugar mills had unanimously decided to pay Rs 1,900 per tonne of sugarcane as first instalment irrespective of the FRP calculation, while factories from Kolhapur had agreed to pay 80% amount as per the FRP formula. Hence, the due amount and its percentage varied in both the districts.Farmers' leader Raju Shetti had pressurised the state government to break the FRP payment into 80:20 formula, where sugar mills were asked to pay 80% amount of FRP as first instalment. The rates of sugar were very low during November to January; hence factories could make payment as per the formula.Meanwhile, the union government announced making sugar export mandatory and prices started surging. With price rise, government and farmers also started pressurising mills to release sugar for export as well as in domestic market and book profit so that it can make payment to farmers.Despite it, some factories refused to pay farmers as per the formula and are now facing action. The state government recently cancelled the licences of some sugar factories and suspended the licences of a few others for their failure to pay as per the FRP."

Late last month, the sugar mill was already under instruction from the District Revenue Officer told to pay Rs. 2,300 per tonne in full to the farmers in the wake of an impasse over the preparedness of the industry to pay only Rs. 1,900 per tonne.The District Revenue Officer, R. Satheesh. who held a tripartite meeting involving the mill officials and farmers representatives gave them 15 days to comply with the FRP norms, to avoid legal action. But, the mill did not give any commitment to that effect, it is learnt.Subsequently, the farmers had reportedly been informed by the mill that Rs. 92.80 per tonne would be deducted towards transport from the procurement cost.The mill had reportedly justified its act reasoning out that the levy of transport charge was inevitable beyond a 10 km radius. Farmers are not prepared to buy this line of thinking. Having sought and obtained an extension of the command area, the onus was on the mill to meet the entire transport cost from the farm to the crushing centre, Subi Thalapathy, representative of Thadapalli-Arakankottai Ayacut Farmers Association said.Agriculture Department sources said the mill had made a partial settlement of dues to farmers, a few days back. Both the private mills in the district, the other based at Aapakodal, have come under severe criticism from farmers for refusing to pay the State Advisory Price. In addition to the FRP, the State Government had fixed Rs. 350, inclusive of Rs. 100 towards transport, as the SAP.The farmers are incensed since the mills have not only failed to pay the SAP along with the FRP, but are also attempting to accentuate losses to farmers by deducting the transport charges out of FRP.Farmers have been complaining that both the private mills have not factored in the revenue generated from sale of by-products: ethanol and power.Sugar mills are expected to settle dues to cultivators within 14 days of procuring the last load from their farms. Beyond that, the mills would be required to pay interest of 15 per cent on the outstanding amount.But, farmers in the district have been waiting for months together to receive their outstanding amounts, leave alone the interest component.The mill had made partial settlement of dues tofarmers, a fewdays back"

However, experts said that there is every reason to celebrate the festival but one should exercise caution while consuming food and bursting crackers.Vaishali Bhalerao, a nutritionist, said one should be careful and eat consciously.""Preferably, it is beneficial if sweets are prepared at home. One can control the quantityof sugar, carbohydrates and calories. Avoid artificial sweeteners and opt for natural ones like dates, jaggery and figs while preparing sweets. Use skimmed milk and honey while making desserts.""Sneha Satish Ved, nutritionist and food technologist, warned against the ill-effects of overeating,.

Indians are prone to diabetes and need to consciously cut down on sugar and starch, she said. As far as firecrackers are concerned, doctors said that many cases of people rushing to hospitals with complaints of burns, eye injuries, hearing problems and even strokes are witnessed after Diwali.Ramakant Bembde, a burn specialist, said some specific precautions must be taken while bursting firecrackers to avoid burns.Bembde said that people still lacked knowledge about how to handle a burns victim. ""Some use cloth to douse the flames instead of splashing water on a victim. Water is a universal remedy to curb the intensity of the injuries.""Srinivas Chauhan, ENT specialist at Government Medical College and Hospital , said that firecrackers contain chemicals such as sulphur dioxide, which is mainly responsible for respiratory problems such as cough, breathlessness and irritation in the throat.

Though India has a strong presence for decades with a sizeable diaspora and business community engaged in trade for decades in Africa, it is way behind China in investments in key infrastructure sectors.After the hosting of the 3rd India Africa Forum Summit (IAFS) in New Delhi in October 2015, India is working symmetrically on a plan to consolidate and further strengthen its engagement with Africa.

US media reported his respiratory trouble was complicated by his Parkinson's disease.Ali spokesman Bob Gunnell earlier told the Courier-Journal in Ali's hometown of Louisville that the fighter remained in fair condition and that a brief stay was still expected.Gunnell noted the ""media frenzy"" touched off each time the iconic fighter is hospitalized, but multiple media reports that Ali's condition was deteriorating triggered widespread concern on Friday evening.One source suggested to the Los Angeles Times that Ali could be hours from death.US celebrity news website radaronline.com quoted an anonymous source as saying Ali required help breathing and that worried family members had gathered at his bedside.Ali, known globally not only for his storied ring career but also for his civil rights activism, has been hospitalized multiple times in recent years.He spent time in hospital in 2014 after suffering a mild case of pneumonia and again in 2015 for a urinary tract infection.His Parkinson's, thought to be linked to the thousands of punches he took during a career that spanned three decades, has limited his public speaking for years.But he has continued to make appearances and offer opinions through his family members and spokespeople.- Prayers for an idol -In April, he attended a Celebrity Fight Night Dinner in Phoenix that raised funds for treatment of Parkinson's.In December, he issued a statement rebuking US presidential hopeful Donald Trump's call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.News of his latest health setback sparked concern among admirers.""Prayers & blessings to my idol,"" boxer Sugar Ray Leonard tweeted.British boxer Amir Khan also offered support via Twitter, saying ""Our Prayers and thoughts are with Muhammad Ali and his family"".Khan added the hashtag ""AliBomaye"" a reference to the chant supporting Ali in the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle against George Foreman in Zaire.Ali -- whose legendary boxing career stretched from 1960 to 1981 -- dazzled fans with slick moves in the ring, and with his wit and engaging persona outside it.His opposition to the Vietnam War saw him banned from the sport for years, but the US Supreme Court overturned his conviction for draft dodging in 1971.Once vilified in some quarters for his conversion to Islam and his outspoken stance on civil rights issues, Ali held firm to earn dozens of tributes, lighting the Olympic torch in 1996 in Atlanta and being named a UN messenger of peace in 1998.He received the highest US civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2005.bb/rcw"

Two years down, she's well aware of her condition and makes no demand for chocolates. But the family has to cough up Rs 20,000 every month towards her diabetes management that includes using an insulin pump. In the absence of an insurance cover, the family has had to make several sacrifices just to ensure Nitya's sugar levels are under control.While in most developed nation all kinds of diabetes come under insurance cover, the situation is different India. Though some insurance companies do provide cover for Type 2 diabetes, Type 1 diabetes, which afflicts a large section of the society, continues to be excluded.This time, the World Health Organization has chosen diabetes as the theme for World Health Day (April 7). Given the scale of the disorder in India, there's a need to create awareness on insurance cover for little patients, says Dr Kavitha Bhat, pediatric endocrinologist, Rainbow Children's Hospital.""Financial management is crucial for lifelong treatment. These children need to undergo multiple blood sugar checks through the day to know the daily insulin dosage. Each strip costs Rs 25,"" says Dr Bhat. The disorder caused due to gene mutations affects some children right from birth and others as they grow.Treatment in such cases begin with detailed discussions with parents and affordability certainly matters, she adds.Speaking of his experience with insurance companies, Guarav UT, the father of a four-year-old boy, says, ""My son was nearly three when he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes after several tests and hospitalization. Initially, the private health insurance covered (refunded) his hospitalization. But once he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, the insurance company backed out, stating that it's not covered under insurance."" Guarav spends more than Rs 5,000 a month for his son's insulin injections. A government employee, he is covered under Employees' State Insurance (ESI) but the scheme doesn't include treatment for Type 1 diabetes.According to International Diabetes Federation statistics, In 2015 India had around 65.1 million people affected with diabetes, compared to 50.8 million in 2010. The number is expected to touch 69.9 million by 2025.Type 1 diabetes occurs at a younger age, especially in early teens, and is described as complete absence of insulin production, usually resulting from autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. It make for 5 to 10 % of diabetes mellitus cases in India.The National Association of Pediatric Endocrinologists has made a representation to the Centre explaining the need to assist children with this condition. ""The government has to sponsor the treatment for these children at least till they turn 18,"" says Dr Anjana Hulse, pediatric endocrinologist, Apollo Hospitals.Says Dr K M Prasanna Kumar, consultant endocrinologist, Bangalore Diabetes Centre (BDC): "" Many diabetic children suffer from renal failure. They must be covered under insurance at least during hospitalization.""Bangalore Diabetes Centre, under the programme 'Changing diabetes in children', has been treating children with Type 1 diabetes for free. ""We have 12 centres in Karnataka and have been able to cater to over thousand patients. But the project is only till 2018. Then on, we'll need government support,"" says Dr K M Prasanna Kumar, consultant endocrinologist, BDC. The programme is sponsored by Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical company.Type 1 diabetes (also known as juvenile diabetes) is the most common form of diabetes among children. According to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), India has about 10 lakh children with Type I diabetes and those in the age group of 10-14 years are at a higher risk of developing it. Those aged between five and nine are at a lower lower risk and the ones in the 0-4 years bracket are at least risk.* Excessive urination* Thirst* Constant hunger* Weight loss* Vision changes* Fatigue"

McDonalds did not immediately respond when asked about which specific preservatives are being removed.The changes come as the worlds biggest burger chain fights to win back customers after three straight years of declining guest counts at its established U.S. locations. Major restaurant chains are scrambling to step up the image of their food as they face more competition from smaller rivals promising wholesome alternatives.Why go to the position of trying to defend them, if the consumer is saying, I prefer not to have that particular ingredient in my food? said Mike Andres, president of McDonalds U.S., during an event at the companys headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, about its food journey.Michael Jacobson, executive director for the Centre for Science in the Public Interest, said the moves by McDonalds dont seem to address the big-picture problem with restaurant food the overabundance of calories.For instance, he said swapping out high-fructose for sugar doesnt make burger buns any healthier.In the past year and a half, McDonalds has also switched to butter from margarine for its Egg McMuffins and added kale and spinach to its salads. Its rivals have made changes as well.Dunkin Donuts, for instance, has promised to put more egg in its egg patty.

According to him, as on August 1, sugar factories are yet to clear dues of Rs. 193.29 crore.The Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association, however, is not satisfied with the action taken by the government. Speaking to The Hindu , association president Kurubur Shanthakumar noted that sugar factories were yet to pay the State advisory price (SAP) for sugarcane for the last two years and had given only the fair and remunerative price (FRP). While the FRP, which is always on a lower level, will be fixed first, the SAP will be decided later based on the actual market situation, he said. He maintained that the differential amount on account of SAP may touch around Rs. 750 crore. Similarly, the defaulting sugar factories had failed to pay the interest of 15 per cent for late payment of dues, as prescribed in the norms, he said.The association also maintained that in addition to the SAP and the interest, growers were yet to get dues of about Rs. 450 crore for the last three years.The association made it clear that it would continue with its decision to enforce a sugarcane crop holiday for the present year to protest against the failure by sugar factories to pay up the entire dues for growers and the alleged reluctance by the government to deal sternly with the defaulting sugar mills.A sizeable number of sugarcane growers have desisted from cultivating sugarcane this year and switched over to other crops. This has made sugar factories in their jurisdiction to feel the heat as some of them are making informal offer of paying remunerative price if they drop the crop-holiday stir and resume sugarcane cultivation, Mr. Shanthakumar said.Growers, however, stick to their crop holiday stand, seeking payment of clearing of dues"

We will also discuss the criticism against TJAC. I plan to speak with the media after the meeting,"" said Kodandaram.Kodandaram, however, responding to some of the criticism he faced over the past two days, said he never nursed political ambitions.

He was addressing the huge RSS gathering at Pimpri-Chinchwad here.More than 1.5 lakh Sangh activists from across 5,000 villages in Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Kolhapur districts in western Maharashtra attended the event.The tone and tenor of the RSS chiefs address emphasised religious unity and extolled an egalitarian society.The bad deeds committed by strong nations are often overlooked, while the good deeds by the weaker nations are often not accorded any value  a nations prestige increases only by its strength. This is the way of the world. But that strength must be calibrated by justice, exhorted the RSS chief, from a massive set resembling Shivajis Raigad Fort.The set was built by noted art director Nitin Desai. An eco-friendly theme was stressed throughout the conclave, which is the RSS biggest effort in recent times to reach out to all sections of society.Mr. Bhagwat cited diversity of Indias culture and its religions as its bedrock and said all religions in the country preached truth and non-violence.Commenting that India could act as a cultural and moral beacon to the world, the RSS chief said that even if a society was materially impoverished, but disciplined and resolute, it could achieve the impossible.Cites IsraelIn this context, the RSS chief referred to the birth of Israel in 1948 following 2000 years of continuous persecution endured by the Jewish people since they became a Diaspora.According to political observers, the real agenda behind the RSS show of strength was a bid to break the stranglehold of the sugar barons of western Maharashtra and supplanting the influence of the Congress and the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party in the region.Also present were Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Sarkaryawah Suresh Joshi  a rare occasion when the latter shared stage with the RSS chief."

Increasing levels of hypertension in the community, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, has emerged as a public health issue in the State in the past decade. The dietary advice world over for controlling hypertension has traditionally focussed on reducing the intake of salt or sodium.But an eye-opening change in concept has now emerged. Latest epidemiological research and interventional studies have shown  and the cardiologists now believe  that the focus has so far been on the wrong white crystals.It made global headlines last year, when two American scientists, in their research article in Open Heart journal, presented evidence that it is sugar and not salt which is a primary underlying cause of hypertension and thus, more dangerous to the heart than salt. Cardiologists now admit that the recommendation to reduce dietary salt intake has not translated into the expected positive cardiovascular outcomes.Scientists, analysing data during a 30-year period from 1970 to 2000 in the U.S., found that even though there had not been much change in the sodium intake pattern of Americans, the incidence of hypertension and the organ damage it created had gone up substantially. They zoomed in on the major lifestyle changes that had happened during this period, which was the increased consumption of processed foods. They probed if it could be something other than salt in processed foods that was giving the adverse heart outcomes, says Tiny Nair, a senior consultant cardiologist.Processed foods are high not just in sodium but highly refined carbohydrates or added sugars which are added to food products during the manufacturing process. It now emerges that the added sugars, particularly fructose in the processed foods, has had a major role in increasing hypertension.The table sugar that is usually added to tea and other beverages is called sucrose, which is a combination of equal parts of glucose and fructose. But the most common sweetener in processed foods  fruit juices, soft drinks, cakes, cookies and any packaged food  is High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), which is more fructose than glucose.Fructose can directly cause obesity and hypertension. It can also indirectly increase hypertension by increasing the uric acid levels in the body. It is proven that high uric acid levels have a direct correlation to cardiovascular disease mortality. Salt may or may not have a role in propagating hypertension but it certainly makes sense that added sugar in processed foods is directly involved in elevating blood pressure, says Dr. Nair. One can take heart in the fact that naturally occurring fructose found in fruits is absolutely safe.(Reporting byC. Maya)"
