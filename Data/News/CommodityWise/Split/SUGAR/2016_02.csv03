As many as 12 primary and blood sugar related tests, will now be diagnosed at a single point, thanks to a machine being installed in partnership with UK-based Diabetacare.The machine will be operated by two experts from UK and two from KGMU along with physicians and will not only save patients from running around, but also money and time. Results which take around 5-6 days for all the diabetes related tests, will with the machine, be delivered instantly. The current cost of the test is around Rs 3,000. It will come down to Rs 1,700 now.""The service was so far available only in government hospitals of Karnataka and I proposed it to the vice chancellor,"" said Dr Ashish Wakhlu, of the paediatric surgery department, KGMU.

This will give necessary confidence to the farmers in the district to cultivate sugarcane, said M. Jayasheela Shetty, factory chairman.The factory has already submitted two plans for its rejuvenation to the State government. The first plan focuses on replacing some of the old machinery which is estimated to cost Rs. 25 crore. The second plan, estimated at Rs. 40 crore, aims to completely replace all the old machinery.We are expecting a response from the authorities for our plans. We are committed to reviving the factory, Mr. Shetty said.Though paddy is the chief crop of the district, it is labour intensive. According to Ramakrishna Sharma, president of Zilla Krishik Sangha, sugarcane cultivation was most suited to the district as it was not labour intensive and required lesser investment.We are all eager to cultivate sugarcane. Sugarcane is 10 times better than paddy. We are waiting for the revival of the factory, he said.Satyanarayana Udupa, general secretary of the district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangha, said that a farmer could easily make a clean profit of Rs. 30,000 per acre with one crop of sugarcane.In contrast if he grows three crops, he might be able to make about Rs. 25,000 per acre. But there should be prompt payment for the sugarcane supplied by the factory management, he said."

He batted extensively in the nets for two hours and looked rather comfortable against both medium-pacers and spinners. With KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan out injured, Gambhir seems to be in the right place at the right time. The news of him playing the third Test was confirmed by Virat Kohli during the press conference on Friday.Time is ticking for the 34-year-old opener and this might well be Gambhir's last chance at salvation.He last played for India more than two years ago, at the Oval in 2014. All he had managed on that occasion was 0 & 3 - combined with 4 & 18 in the previous game at Old Trafford. More than the single-digit scores, it was the manner in which he surrendered in the testing conditions against the likes of James Anderson and Stuart Broad that had the fans disheartened. That failure prompted many to call curtains on his international career, and for a while, it seemed so. Gambhir was out of fray for a long list of series India played but constant success in the IPL and his recent purple patch in the Duleep Trophy - where he managed six 50-plus scores in a row - revived his career.And now he's back, ready to reclaim what was once his - the opening slot. At 34, he might not fit in India's scheme of things anymore. However, stranger things have happened. Shikhar Dhawan has just one half-century in the last 16 innings and he seems to be hanging by the thread. In such a scenario, Gambhir may fill in as a stop-gap arrangement till India bloods more openers.Following his inclusion in the squad ahead of the Kolkata Test, a defiant Gambhir made his intentions clear on social media. ""Excitement of a debutant, certainty of experienced, nervousness of a novice...am feeling it all. Eden here I come loaded with ambitions. Nothing beats playing again for d country. Test cricket, whites, red ball and India cap again. Thanks @BCCI, thanks 2 all for d prayers,"" he had tweeted.And even though he did not get a chance in Kolkata, a finger injury to Dhawan has brought Gambhir to the cusp of playing his 57th Test for the country. ""The body language was good, but still I realised that my game was not where it should be,"" he told Star Sports. ""That's why I went to Australia and cleared my doubts with Justin. Obviously he's a mentally strong character and being a left-handed opening batsman himself, he gave some valuable which I believe worked well for me.""It's not that Gambhir hasn't done his bit. He went to Australia and under the guidance of former opener Justin Langer and coach Noddy Holder, Gambhir took up an intense workout schedule and worked on his fitness. On Langer's suggestion, he now has an open-chested stance that allows him to be more in control against short-pitched bowling. He has worked equally hard on his diet having completely given up carbs, sugar and oily food. Moreover, he even built a state-of-the-art indoor batting facility at his home.There is a huge possibility that Gambhir may not be in Indian squad for the Tests against England. But for now, the focus lies at Holkar. Gambhir fans must be hoping he turns back the clock."

The best way is to get medically assessed before the fasting month of Ramzan, say doctors.The American Diabetes Association and ayurveda practitioners stress on the importance of seeking medical advice and undergoing pre-Ramzan assessment for better management of the condition during the fasting month. People with diabetes have a high risk of developing fasting-related complications during Ramzan, say doctors.City-based endocrinologists say changes in eating patterns during Ramzan can put people with type 2 diabetes (those who have insulin resistance) at the risk of complications such as low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), thrombosis and dehydration.Consultant diabetologist Aravinda Jagadish says the risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetics who fast is because of decreased food intake apart from certain medications. Symptoms of hypoglycaemia include sweating, dizziness, hunger and irritability.Asserting that people with type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent) and uncontrolled diabetes should not fast, Dr. Krishna from Shatayu Ayurveda says tailored management of diabetes including treatment changes could help minimise the risks.Raja Selvarajan, Consultant Diabetologist, Apollo Sugar Clinic, says blood glucose levels are likely to go down during the day when one is not eating. In individuals who take insulin or diabetes medication, the risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) occurring is much higher. He says it is advisable to limit physical activity during fasting hours and be more active after sunset.It is also important to know what to eat if you are a diabetic and are fasting, say doctors.Blood glucose levels naturally go up after breaking the fast ( iftar ). The risk is when glucose levels go too high and this happens as a result of overeating or eating too many sugary foods. Watch out for eating too many sweets and keep the portion sizes moderate, says Dr. Selvarajan.Apart from taking care to have a balanced meal and not straying away from the diabetic diet, the iftar should be split into two snacks and a meal. While breaking the fast, dates should be replaced by fruits and oily/fried food should be avoided, the doctors add.(Reporting by Afshan Yasmeen)DOCTORS PRESCRIPTIONDo not fastif you are a Type I diabetic (insulin-dependent)if your blood glucose is not under controlif blood glucose goes down frequently or is erraticif you have any other associated illnessPRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN BEFORE FASTINGSeek medical opinionModify oral medication as per doctors adviceFollow proper dietHave a snack at iftar followed by a meal and a bed-time snackHave adequate fluids/waterDo not binge during iftarAvoid oily foodAvoid daily intake of non-veg food"

Targeting the PM, he said, ""Modi selfie leta hai, masti karta hai, iski masti kam karna hai.""Here too, people were seen taking away cots after Rahul finished his address.The 6th day of Kisan Yatra of Rahul began with a meeting at Sathiaon in Azamgarh district, where SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav had recently inaugurated the renovated sugar mill. It was followed by a road show in the weaver and Muslim-dominated areas like Mubarakpur and several meetings along the route to Mau and Ghazipur. However, his road show in Azamgarh lacked the spirit like Jaunpur show held on Saturday. Before beginning the road show, he also made a stopover at Aljamiyatul Asharfiya in Azamgarh. He also paid tributes at the statues of Congress leader Kalpanath Rai and BR Ambedkar in Mau.Almost all speeches of Rahul remained centered on Modi, though he also targeted BSP supremo Mayawati and UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. ""Haathi sabkuchh kha gaya, apne cycle laya, wo puncture ho gayi, haath lao dekho hum kya karte hain (The elephant consumed everything, you brough bicycle but it got punctured. Bring haath (Congress) and see what we can do),"" said Rahul, adding, ""We thought that Akhilesh is a nice man, he is young and will do something good. But, it is unfortunate that he failed to deliver.""Modi goes to America , takes selfie with his friend Obama and without returning to India, he goes to China and Japan. But he never takes a selfie with any farmer, Rahul said. ""Farmers sell daal at Rs 40/kg, but buy at Rs 200. Ye dekho Modi ka kamal,"" he said, adding, ""Mein us aadmi ko khoj raha hoon jisko Modi ne 15 lakh diya, (I am looking for a man who received Rs 15 lakh from Modi, but failed to find any),"" he saidInteracting with farmers at the Khat Sabha, he continued his attack on Modi. ""A bureaucrat told me that Modi is not happy because he realized that he failed to fulfil the promises he had made,"" Rahul said, adding that people also know that he (Modi) is a flop PM and only makes false promises.""The only thing Modi (and RSS) is doing sincerely is dividing people on caste and religious lines. Ye logon ko ladana jante hain,"" he said, adding that Congress believes in unity and togetherness. ""It is in our DNA,"" he said.In Azamgarh, a few members of Ulema Council were seen holding black flags. But they were dispersed by police before Rahul arrived."

It was 5 per cent in May last year. The last time the retail inflation was higher was in August 2014 when it crossed 7 per cent. A jump in food inflation has led to the increase in overall print for inflation, Richa Gupta, Senior Economist, Deloitte said. Vegetable prices have moved up over the past one month and inflation (in vegetable prices) has now moved into double digit territory possibly reflecting the effect of the hot weather conditions. Shortage in the sugar market has also moved up prices and could move up further during the festival season.Monetary easing in the near term looks difficult especially with expectations rising of a possible rate hike by the U.S. Fed and the effects on monsoons still unclear, Ms. Gupta said.Food basketEfficient management of the food basket is likely to become crucial for any monetary easing in the future. Expect easing to commence only when the RBI is sure of hitting the 5 per cent target in March next year, she said.The data, released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Monday, shows that inflation in the food and beverages segment accelerated to 7.2 per cent in May, the highest it has been in 21 months. It was 6.3 per cent in April.Overall, only food inflation witnessed acceleration while the other major segments in the index recorded marginal slowdown.The clothing and footwear segment saw inflation easing to 5.37 per cent in May, its lowest level in at least four years, compared to 5.56 per cent in April. The housing segment saw a marginal easing of inflation to 5.35 per cent in May, down from 5.37 per cent in April.Core inflationCore inflation moved down imparting a downward bias to the overall print, Ms Gupta said. However, this decline could possibly be short lived as the seventh pay commission is implemented and the base effect in certain categories wears off.Efficient management of the food basket may become crucial for any monetary easing in the future"

The month of Ramzan has just commenced during which most followers of Islam undertake a month-long fasting till Eid-ul-fitr. As lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and kidney ailments have become common and at least one of these is found in almost every household, doctors advice special caution to be exercised for those under medication in case they want to undertake fasting. Eating the right diet is also essential as one has to sustain and work throughout the day on an empty stomach as eating is permitted only from evening till before sunrise.Dr Triveni Reddy, internal medicine expert from Care Hospital, said, ""Fasting is not recommended for diabetics, cardiac and renal patients, especially those who have recently suffered heart attack, undergone bypass surgery or stenting, or kidney transplant in the last one or two years. Those on dialysis and pregnant women (especially in the first and third trimester) should also avoid fasting.""However, there are some strong-willed devoted people who despite their physical frailty are adamant on undertaking the month-long fasting which forbids even drinking water. For them, doctors have special suggestions.It's essential that diabetics don't skip their medicines during this period if at all they undertake fast. Such patients should consult their physicians and get their drug regime changed. ""There are safe and effective drugs which can be taken at late night and early morning which won't drop the sugar level very fast and can control the sugar for 24 hours. So, even if they fast throughout the day, their sugar levels can be regulated. As for patients of high blood pressure, drug intake shouldn't stop but the timing can be changed to night and early morning. If cardiac patients decide on fasting, they should do so only after consulting their cardiologists and take their medicines as advised, get their BP and all parameters checked. Patients with gastric or peptic ulcers or those in their first and third trimester of pregnancy shouldn't fast. The organs of the unborn child is formed during the first three months, so fasting must be avoided by them,"" advised Dr Reddy.Sometimes, there's a family history of diabetes. So, before starting Ramzan fasting for the first time, it's essential to check their sugar level as fasting brings out the latent diabetes in patients, added Dr Reddy.As for diet, doctors recommend a high calorie, high protein diet that can sustain one throughout the day. Though eating sweets and fatty food is okay in the evenings the early morning, the diet should be high on calorie and protein that would give them energy. Fruits and dry fruits should also be a part of morning diet. ""It's also advisable to break the fast in the evenings with fresh fruits and avoid too fatty food at night or early morning. Since people tend to eat more at night after fasting all day, they tend to eat more fatty and carbohydrate-rich food and put on weight. So light exercise is also recommended besides maintaining a balanced diet,"" added Padmashri physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao.Diabetics and high blood pressure patients should not skip their medicines during Ramzan fasting. They should consult their physicians and get their drug regime changedCardiac patients should fast only after consulting cardiologistsPatients with gastric or peptic ulcers or those in their first and third trimester of pregnancy shouldn't fastThose with a family history of diabetes should check their sugar level before starting Ramzan fasting for the first timeEarly morning diet should be high on calorie and protein that would give energyFruits and dry fruits should also be a part of morning dietIt is advisable to break the fast in the evenings with fresh fruits and avoid too fatty food at night or early morning"

Last year, the SAP was fixed at Rs. 550 a tonne including Rs. 100 towards transport cost. But, barring the 15 cooperative mills, private mills have not paid the dues towards SAP on the premise that the Union Government favoured scrapping it.SubsidyThe South India Sugar Mills Association, on its part, has been insisting on direct payment of subsidy by the government to the farmers rather than burdening the mills that are already reeling in a financial crisis.The Union Government had set a precedent of sharing the burden late last year with its announcement to provide a subsidy of Rs. 4.50 a quintal of sugarcane crushed to farmers.The Union Government had announced that the subsidy will be paid directly to the farmers on behalf of the mills and adjusted against the cane price payable to the farmers towards FRP including arrears related to previous years.This works out to Rs. 45 more for a tonne of cane.As far as the private mills in Erode district are concerned, they have been accepting to pay only the FRP and have bluntly refused to comply with SAP.The mills are able to find a leeway because the SAP is only a recommendation and does not hold a statutory effect unlike the FRP, according to official sources.Farmers wonder why the State Government should announce SAP at all every year if it is not binding on the mills."

A high-power Russian-made night vision device was also recovered, along with 18 grams of brown sugar, stashed inside a cupboard.A case has been registered against Elahi at the Dibrugarh police station under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 and the Arms Act, 1959.According to law enforcement agencies, Elahi started out as a small-time tailor in the Kalibari area of the town in the early 70s. Later, he went on to become the biggest drug lord of upper Assam, amassing a huge fortune through his illegal narcotics trade.He is believed to be a close partner of Pakhi Miyan alias Hazi Samsul Haque, one of the biggest drug barons in the northeast. Elahi, who is now in his late-fifties, controls the entire chain of operations from procurement and transport to distribution of drugs at various levels. He has been arrested several times but has managed to come out on bail on every occasion, exploiting the loopholes of the law. He was last arrested with two of his top henchmen from Dibrugarh on March 16, 2012 with 1.15 kg of brown sugar. His wife and accomplice Ashu Begum is also wanted by the police.Elahi is said to be running his empire of cocaine, heroin and brown sugar from Panchali and Kalibari area with the help of a close-knit distribution network consisting mostly of women peddlers and school dropouts. Sources said one can buy a gram of brown sugar for as little as Rs 500 right in the middle of the town.Friday's crackdown, which led to the arrest of Elahi, was carried out by Dibrugarh Police under 'Operation Drugs-Free Dibrugarh', launched in the first week of May.So far, 11 drug dealers and peddlers have fallen into the police net. A substantial amount of contraband has also been seized during the crackdown."

But then, it lost sheen as it was unable to match the production of cane sugar.One of the major impediments was that there was no mechanised method to produce like cane sugar. But, that tide is fast changing again as with its lower glycemic index is in demand over cane sugar.Considering its huge potential, Thassim Beevi Abdul Kader College for Women has come out with a technology to produce with machines. This new technology was discussed during the international conference on food, nutrition and health organised by the college in Madurai from June 6 to 8.Few pockets like Udangudi, Vembar in Tuticorin district, Sayalkudi in Ramanathapuram district and Srivilliputhur in Virudhunagar district are still famous for making palm jaggery from the sap of palm trees. They also make in conventional method by boiling palm sap for many hours to remove its impurities and store it in anaerobic containers where crystals are formed on threads tied inside the container. It takes 45 to 60 days to get in this manner.The technology invented by the college provides in powder form within six hours.Explaining the technology, S Muthumariswari, assistant professor, department of home science and research centre, said there is enormous demand for not just in India but from abroad as well. She has created the technology as part of her PhD research.""In many places of Ramanathapuram district, people still make or powdered palm jaggery whenever there is a need. Considering the huge potential, we are making using machines,"" she said.The college has tied up with Coimbatore-based Dinu Technology to create the machine. J Dinesh from Dinu Technology said that similar to conventional method, in this technology too, palm sap is boiled and crystallised.""Unlike 45 to 60 days, machine processing takes only six hours and sugar content may vary depending on the region. For instance, palm sap in Ramanathapuram district will have more sugar content than other places,"" he explained.It is said that there used to be five to eight crore palm trees in Tamil Nadu. After toddy tapping was banned, palm trees have seen a steady decline and there are only three crore now.When demand for is said to revive palm cultivation, modern technology to manufacture it will be a great boon. But the machine cost is quite higher for poor palm farmers to afford, says Dr S Sumayaa, principal of the college urging government's support in this regard."

Hence, Maharashtra government should lift the moratorium on conducting trials of all genetically modified (GM) crops in the state. Such bans or restrictions in conducting research trials will only push the agriculture sector backwards rather than taking it forward.These were the observations by CD Mayee, former chairman of the Agriculture Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB). Mayee was speaking to reporters at a programme organized by the Association of Biotechnology-led Enterprises  Agriculture Focus Group (Able-AG) in city on Tuesday on the importance of increasing productivity and profitability of oilseed and pulses.""Indian agriculture is at the cross roads and there is strong need to improve the stagnating yields of all crops,"" Mayee said.""India imports pulses costing Rs30,000 crore and oil costing Rs90,000 crore, the highest imported items after gold and petroleum. Vidarbha has a high potential for pulses and oilseed crops. Andhra Pradesh allowed the Bt chickpea trials. But Maharashtra didn't. It is sad that this is despite the Kakodkar committee recommendations,"" he said. Mayee admitted that GM crops alone cannot be an answer to all problems in agriculture. But an adequate mix of all types of technologies, including organic, can minimize the agrarian distress.In India, 16 types of trials are on in different crops including cotton, rice (drought tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency), brinjal, sugar cane (drought tolerance), Bt chickpea and maize. ""Farmer wants technology, be it Swadeshi or foreign. If Swadeshi technology is available, it is always welcome but that doesn't mean that foreign technologies should be restricted,"" said Mayee.The Able-AG executive director Shivendra Bajaj, speaking on the proposed fields trials in Maharashtra and barriers in the way of introduction of agricultural technology in the state, said that GM technology was always a supporting technology and definitely not the only solution for all the problems in the agriculture sector. But he stressed on the need for openness in allowing research and development by the states. ""There is no issue of safety so for in any of the GM crops. GM technology is commercialized only after rigorous trials. Concerns of the general public and scientists can be addressed only through discussion and not banning trials,"" he said.Two progressive farmers from Yavatmal district, Vijay Niwal and Vasant Kale, also voiced the need for newer technologies for improving agriculture as they didn't see any future in conventional methods of farming. ""Every technology has some limitations, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be tried. We want solutions to our problems. Whether they come from home or abroad is immaterial to us. Younger generation would never take up agriculture unless it is technology based,"" said Niwal, who is surviving on Bt cotton since 2003."

The end of a day's abstinence from food is often marked by bingeing on succulent kheema and creamy delights of haleem.Medical practitioners have, however, said people suffering from diabetes and heart ailments should observe fast under the supervision of their doctors.""Those observing fast during Ramzan have to refrain from eating food, water as well as medications from dawn to dusk. Even injecting medicines and nutritional fluids into the body are also restricted during the period of fasting,"" they said. Since the fasting period lasts for around 15 hours, it necessitates special health precautions by the patients, they added.People suffering from Type 1 diabetes, and dependent on insulin, should avoid fasting altogether since it might lead to rise in blood sugar level, thus, taking a toll on their health, said city-based physician Umar Quadri.He said people with Type 2 diabetes can fast. ""However, these people too should take utmost care while incorporating changes in their eating habits as advised by the doctors,"" he said, advising them to stay from fried and spicy food while consuming sugar-free drinks.""Those suffering from Type 2 diabetes should consume sufficient food in the morning itself. They should also keep themselves hydrated and take their medicines regularly as per doctors' prescription,"" Quadri added.At iftar (breaking of the fast), such patients should eat in small portions and keep having fruit juice and light eatables. After which, they should immediately take their medicines, said a senior physician Ashwini Kumar.Diabetics should eat within an hour of breaking the fast, Kumar said, adding they should consume light food like salad instead of gorging on all the delicacies offered. ""However, if the blood sugar falls there is no restriction to undergo laboratory test during fasting,"" Quadri said. If blood sugar level is below 60mg/dm, then the person should immediately break the fast and consult a doctor, he added.People observe day-long fast in Ramzan and eat delicacies in the evening, which leads to rise in blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, said cardiologist Vilas Magarkar.He said people who have either undergone angioplasty three months ago or those with a bypass surgery should not fast."" Fasting is not advisable for these patients since they have to take medicine many times a day and also need to maintain water levels in their bodies,"" Magarkar said. People with high uncontrolled blood pressure should also avoid fasting, he added.As per Islamic laws, individuals are exempt from Ramzan fasting if they suffer from an illness and could be adversely affected by fasting. Meanwhile, people with diabetes associated with other ailments such as kidney or heart disease should stay away from fasting to avoid complications, Quadri said.Patients at risk of diabetes should avoid overeating during iftar to prevent post-meal high blood pressureThe exercise programme for diabetics should be modified to avoid their lower blood sugar levels. They should exercise two hours after the sunset mealFood restriction and dehydration may cause some cardiac risk in the elderly.People suffering from Type 1 diabetes, and dependent on insulin, should avoid fasting altogetherIf the blood sugar falls below 60 or rises above 300, the fast should be immediately broken"

And many are happy about adding a few extra kilos so the baby will be 'healthy'. So, doctors were not surprised when they found only one in 10 pregnant women exercised adequately, without realising that just sitting around can increase health risks fourfold. However, brisk walking reduced risks of adverse impact on the infant's health by up to 70%.A study on physical activity patterns and gestational diabetes by a team of doctors from city-based Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre and Seethapathy Clinic and Hospital along with scientists at the International Diabetes Federation, Belgium and Purdue University, US has concluded that a low-cost, culturally appropriate model of care can make significant improvement in physical activity in women with gestational diabetes resulting in better control of sugar levels and reduction in adverse neonatal outcomes.Nearly 800 pregnant women were part of the study, 'WINGS' (women in India with gestational diabetes strategy), that looked at effects of exercise intervention on change in physical activity patterns, blood glucose levels and pregnancy outcomes. It found 10.7% of pregnant women did the recommended level of physical activity.The recommended level of physical activity for pregnant women, like every adult, is at least 30 minutes of brisk walk every day in the first two trimesters and as much as one can in the last trimester. Those with gestational diabetes (diabetes during pregnancy) - 189 women - lead a more sedentary life compared normal women.In 2014, a national study by Dr Anjana and her team found less than 10% of Indians did any kind of physical activity and 54.4% of the population was physically inactive. The study showed that one in two Indians was inactive.In an attempt to increase physical activity in women with gestational diabetes, the doctor encouraged them to use a pedometer, an instrument that counts steps. After intervention, moderate activity increased from 15.2% to 26.5% and sedentary lifestyle decreased from 84.8% to 73.5%.This lead to decrease in daily sugar levels, but no major changes in HbA1C. Overall, 19.3% of women had adverse outcomes - 13.3% children with higher birth weight, 3.2% admissions to neonatal ICUs and 1.3 % with low blood sugar. Deeper analysis, however, showed a 70% decrease risk for adverse neonatal outcomes even after adjusting for confounding variables."

This is the season when these sellers garner maximum business and with the heat destined to worsen until the rains arrive. These remain a popular sight all over the satellite city.With temperatures rising by the day people opt for lighter meals, often having their fill with a plate of sliced fruit and a juice. While fresh fruit juices top the list, ice-cold lemonade, sugarcane juice, lassi and chaas are also popular choices. And of course there are the branded colas and fruit juices, but nothing beats the heat like street food. A limbu paani seller in Vashi sells close to 300 glasses a day, on weekends almost 500. ""This is the season and people are always looking for something to quench their thirst,"" he said.Not to be left behind are the sugarcane vendors and their unusual contraption for extracting the juice. At Rs 10 a glass this is the best quencher, and you will find them at almost every street corner in Navi Mumbai. ""Usually we buy the sugarcane in bulk from the wholesale market twice a week, but during this season, we need to make that trip almost every day since stock gets over,"" said Savita Gawde, a seller from Nerul.""Fruit plates are the best bet during this season,"" said college student Deepak Jagtiani. Affordable and fresh, he feels they are easy on the wallet and more importantly they fill you up.

Sugar and fertiliser units fared badly with EID Parry Ltd reporting a 49% decline in profit to Rs 168 crore and Coromandel International incurring a 8% loss. Engineering arm Tube Investments grew a 9% .It is the stated objective of the group to grow three times the country's GDP. While Indian economy grew 7.6% in 2015-16, the group's revenues grew at just 9%. ""It was a challenging year,"" A Vellayan, executive chairman, Murugappa Group told a news conference. He, however, said that the agri focussed businesses of EID Parry and Coromandel Internation were well positioned to take advantage of the uptick on sugar -- driven byu higher prices and fertiliser business--expected to do well on the back of a good monsoon forecast.The group said it does not have any plans for fresh capital expenditure for 2016-17. ""We had invested Rs 300 crore last year as capex. We had spent most of it. The remainder will be used for this fiscal,"" said N Srinivasan, director - finance, Murugappa Group. ""Our plants are currently running at 70% capacity. We want to increase optimum usage at the plant to 90%. Currently, we don't see the need for further capital expenditure,"" said A Vellayan, executive chairman, Murugappa Group.Its outlook for the sugar industry, however, was strong. ""We are expecting the next two years to be one of the best for the industry,"" said chairman Vellayan, after the EID Parry (India) posted an 86% decline in profit before interest and tax to Rs 26 crore from Rs 189 crore last year. Sugar prices have since risen which lends optimism. Sales realisation was lower in the first three quarters of the financial year - with profitability getting hit due to low sugar prices. ""Sugar prices recovered by the fourth quarter, but it was not sufficient to make for the three earlier quarters. We are expecting sugar prices to go up by Rs 10-Rs 15 and with that will come our 20% growth - that we have given as guidance,"" said Srinivasan.The group's Carborundum Universal, which produces silicon carbide saw its profit grow 49% to Rs 267 crore from improved sales in abrasives and electrominerals. ""Our unit in Russia is expected to benefit from the depreciation in the Rouble. We definitely see a growth opportunity there when it comes to exports,"" said Vellayan. Carborundum Universal Ltd saw only a 2% growth in sales to Rs 2,172 crore, as higher sales of electrominerals and abrasives was offset by a 3% dip in ceramic sales.Tube Investments of India Ltd saw a 9% increase in profit to Rs 431 crore with strong sales at TI Cycles despite flat volumes at Tube Products of India. TI Cycles saw a 14% growth in volumes and 13% higher revenue at Rs 1,485 crore. ""We are seeing renewed interest in cycles as people become more health conscious. There has also been increasing awareness in eco-friendly transport options and reducing one's carbon footprint. Our premium segment (between Rs 50,000 - Rs 1 lakh a cycle) has seen a boost because of all the cycling clubs mushrooming in cities,"" said Srinivasan.Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company saw its gross written premium grow 30% to Rs 2,452 crore.

The taxes in the civic limits are high, which forced industries to shift outside the city. If the industry shifts, the youth from our area will lose their jobs. Moreover, the condition of people with low-earning jobs may become worse.""The representatives told the officials that if the merger takes place, the government might face serious law and order situation as the emotions of the villagers are running high.Many representatives claimed that the basis on which the KMC is demanding the merger is false and is aimed at grabbing agricultural land by imposing reservations.Ajit Narke, a property developer and chairman of a sugar factory, said, ""The villagers can afford basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter at reasonable prices in the villages. Once the merger takes place, then all these needs will become costly. The property and water supply taxes will be much higher. Moreover, the building permission process will be lengthier and costly.

It would create direct employment opportunity for 12,000 people. It would soon be tabled before the state-level single window clearance authority.According to sources in the Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha Limited (Ipicol), there was hardly any progress on other big-ticket proposals like petrochemical complex by Indian Oil Corporation Ltd with an investment of Rs 15,000 crore, expansion of Nalco (Rs 20,000 crore) and alumia refinery by L&T (Rs 12,000 crore).Though the government announced receiving the investment proposals during the Make in India event, the investors had announced these earlier on different platforms, said an officer in the industries department.Similarly, the fate of another investment proposal worth Rs 5,000 crore for a solar park by Indonesia-based firm Zenyam also hangs in balance.The other proposals, which the state government claimed of receiving at the Make in India week, were Rs 1,000 crore in Electronic System Design & Manufacturing sector by US based Sanmina, Rs 250 crore and Rs 809 crore in food processing sector by Ruchi Soya and ITC respectively and Rs 2,000 crore in infrastructure development sector by Tata special economic zone. Other proposals include Rs 1,000 crore in chemical and fertilizer sector by Deepak Fertilizers, Rs 8.350 crore in renewable energy sector by Panchavaktra Holdings, Rs 1,000 crore in sugar industry by NSL group, Rs 1,800 crore in power sector by GMR and Rs 1,000 crore in aluminium downstream by Vedanta Limited.

He added that this move will keep sufficient availability of sugar in domestic market and the price will be under control. According to trade sources, sugar exports have become viable now as global prices have increased by 50 per cent in last three months due to disruption in supply from Brazil.  PTI"
58f611b57be9e031f13adefc,Doctors find low vitamin-D in diabetics,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Doctors-find-low-vitamin-D-in-diabetics/articleshow/52843530.cms,2016-06-21,"Chennai: While the spiral in diabetes cases remains a cause of concern, researchers have now found high prevalence of vitamin- D deficiency in those suffering from the metabolic disorder.A study undertaken by M V Diabetes Research Centre, covering 4,600 patients with type-2 diabetes in Chennai, found that more than 70% of them had deficient and 15% had insufficient vitamin-D. vitamin-D plays a major role in bone metabolism and in the regulation of intestinal absorption of minerals such as calcium and phosphorous. Deficiency of the vitamin has been linked to chronic diseases like hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.Chief diabetologist Dr Vijay Viswanathan, who was part of the research team, said the findings were significant as studies in the past have identified lack of vitamin-D as one of the contributing factors for diabetes. ""Although the prevalence of vitamin-D deficiency is high in the general population, we wanted to find if it was high among those with diabetes too as there are theories that lack of the vitamin can impact glucose metabolism,"" said Dr Viswanathan. The researchers didn't just find that prevalence was high among the diabetic population; the study threw a surprise: the highest occurrence of Vitamin-D deficiency was in the 30-50 years age group at 76.2%. The figure for the same among the 50-70 age group was 70% and the least among those above the age of 70 at 66.5%.Researchers said the study highlighted the need for including Vitamin-D tests as part of the routine examination for sugar levels. ""As of now, we just check cholesterol, creatinine level (which indicates the kidney function) and blood urea nitrogen. Vitamin-D is rarely considered as the tests are also quite expensive,"" said Dr Viswanathan, adding those with borderline diabetes should also get themselves examined as lack of the vitamin can push up sugar levels.""But we still need to conduct further investigations to establish the exact association between Vitamin-D levels and risk of developing type-2 diabetes,"" he added.Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin to function properly, or the body's cells don't react to insulin. This means that glucose stays in the blood and isn't used as fuel for energy.Vitamin D deficiency, on the other hand, has been traditionally associated with rickets and other ailments related to the bone. However, increasingly, research has revealed the importance of the vitamin in protecting against a host of health problems, including diabetes.The present study, which was published in the International Journal of Diabetes in Developing Countries, also found high calcium deficiency in those lacking the vitamin.Doctors say although the deficiency of both may not directly impact the current treatment, it could cause complications in some patients."

Even the Madras High Court has allowed shooting of wild boars by a forest department officer in the rank of a ranger. The Tamil Nadu government should implement these orders, R. Subash, a farmer said.Huge lossEkambaram, another farmer said, many farmers have faced huge losses after wild boars damaged crops. In Ambur forest range alone, there could be at least 5,000 wild boars. We raise crops after so much difficulty, but end up facing loss for our one year of hard work due to these wild animals. The compensation given by the Forest department is very low, he said.While Raghupathy, another farmer, said farmers in Vellore have been raising this issue for the last 10 years. But still, no solution has been arrived at. We are unable to raise crops such as groundnut. Is the government not worried about the welfare of farmers here? he questioned.The farmers wanted the government to take up measures to shoot down the wild boars.Many of them wondered if the State government had failed to represent the magnitude of the issue to the Centre.However, Umesh Suman, district forest officer, said steps are being taken to address the issue. The census of wild boars was carried out. We also put forward these details during a review meeting. The final decision from the government is yet to come, he said.Sugar mill arrearsA farmer said the cooperative sugar mills were yet to pay the pending arrears to sugarcane growers for 2015-2016 and 2016-2017.An official replied that all 16 cooperative sugar mills in the State were yet to pay the pending amount to farmers due to paucity of funds. For 2015, Rs. 350 per tonne was pending as payment.We informed the Labour Minister about this issue during a review meeting held on June 13. The Minister has assured to take appropriate action. The funds are likely to be provided by the end of June or July, the official said.A. C. Venkatesan, another farmer, urged Collector R. Nanthagopal to take steps to remove encroachments from all water bodies in the district and desilt them so that water could be stored when it rained.Many farmers wanted the State government to waive all loans  both taken from cooperative and nationalised banks - for farmers. They also wanted the Thenpennnai-Palar link project to be implemented soon.In Ambur forest range alone, there could be at least 5,000 wild boars, which attact crops"

Government pleader Pu-rnima Kantharia opposed Bhujbal's bail plea.The vacation judge posted Bhujbal's plea for bail to be heard and decided on May 25 when the medical report is to be submitted. The JJ Hospital dean has to set up a panel of three doctors to examine Bhujbal. Senior counsel Amit Desai and advocate Sajal Yadav, who appeared for the NCP leader, said he was suffering from heart ailment and other medical conditions that required medical attention. Besides, the bail plea denied any wrongdoing and claimed he was ""law-abiding'' with no criminal antecedents. His bail plea, a copy of which TOI has, said, ""The allegations of money laundering pertain to companies which were controlled by Sameer Bhujbal'', adding that he was ""neither a director nor a shareholder in such companies and was in no way in charge...""Sameer, his nephew and co-accused, was the first to be arrested in February. Bhujbal said he was in the US, on a pre-planned trip and yet returned, only to be arrested on March 14.A special trial judge had on May 13, rejected a bail plea made by Bhujbal. He moved HC for bail citing ""multiple problems related to heart, lungs and sleep'' for which he is ""under treatment since 1990"".His bail plea summarised his medical conditions. It said he has been ""suffering from bronchial asthma since 1980 for which he is being periodically seen by his chest physician since 1999... also using nebulizer since 1990 and is prone to asthma attack which can be induced by infection or stress .""He was under treatment since 1990 for his hypertension . He also has diabetes and requires regular sugar monitoring. The list continued with his operation for ""shoulder replacement"" and a ""tear in retina "" which needs monitoring.Bhujbal's argument in the bail plea is that his ""fragile health'' needs ""timely treatment''failing which ""untold harm'' may occur to him."

In the United States, medical marijuana has been legalized in 24 states and the capital Washington, while recreational marijuana is legal in four states and the District of Columbia.""We first got into business in 2012, we got approved for a license back then and we sat on it for a while. We started growing a year ago,"" said Lawson-Baker, who is originally from Australia.- Millions -""We thought we would make millions fast,"" Lawson-Baker said.But with the Washington medicinal marijuana market still relatively small, and stiff competition already out there, he soon realized he was in it for the long haul.Until demand takes off -- which it fully expects it will -- Alternative Solutions is growing only half of the 1,000 plants allowed by its license.The Australian and his American father-in-law/business partner Bob Simmons -- both of whom previously worked in construction -- are also still learning the intricacies of cannabis cultivation.Depending on the variety, the end product can fetch between $3,000 and $4,500 a pound (about $6,615 to $9,920 per kilogram).In the three harvests since November 2015, the company has generated $700,000 in revenue, and the owners are hoping to break even in three or four years.The fourth harvest is currently underway.A magnifying glass reveals a forest of tiny white pistils covering the leaves and buds of the marijuana plants. The aim is to have plants that look like they're covered with fine sugar -- or when viewed close-up, tiny crystals of ice.""The more, the better,"" Simmons said. ""You want them dumped in sugar.""During harvest, each marijuana plant is cut at the base and hung upside-down to dry for about 10 days before the buds are cut off and trimmed.The trimmings are processed into powder ($40 per gram) or resin ($90 per gram). Those products and the buds themselves are then sold in Washington's five official marijuana dispensaries.- Opportunity -Those in the cannabis business hope Washington will one day fully legalize recreational marijuana.Since February 2015, anyone over 21 in Washington can consume marijuana on private property, possess up to two ounces (56 grams) and grow as many as six plants.However, the legal purchase and sale of marijuana for recreational use are not permitted, leading to an explosion in street sales.""The police doesn't know how to handle things so basically they turn a blind eye to it,"" Lawson-Baker said.With more and more US states allowing medical and recreational marijuana use, it seems he was smart to get in early: the country's marijuana market is estimated to reach $22 billion in 2020, up from $4.6 billion in 2014.- Heaven -In its immaculate 3,600 square foot (335 square meter) growing area with a surprising lack of any distinctive smell, Alternative Solutions is pampering 12 varieties.""Blue Cheese"" is pungent and stings the nose, while ""AK47"" -- unexpectedly -- is softer. ""Green Love Potion"" supposedly has aphrodisiac qualities while ""Goji OG"" remains the best-seller.The temperature and humidity are slightly higher in areas with flowering plants, compared to the rooms for incubation and the mother plants, which provide cuttings and never bloom.""It's a heaven for marijuana. We've created the best environment in which they could grow in,"" Simmons said.Their secret: a high-performance watering system that includes filtration, oxygenation and the addition of plant-based nutrients. Filming or photographing the system was strictly off-limits.Much of the growing operation, including temperature and watering, can be controlled remotely over the Internet.The 84 flowering plants receive about 200 gallons (750 liters) of water per day, and are grown without chemicals or pesticides.From the cutting to the finished product, everything is labelled and can be traced by barcode. The warehouse is inspected monthly by health authorities and police.Like their competitors, Lawson-Baker and Simmons are anxious to find out who will be the next occupant of the White House, just three miles (five kilometers) from their marijuana farm. The next president's views on marijuana will play a major role in shaping future policies on the substance.The pair remain optimistic: they've already obtained a second license to grow in Washington, are waiting for another in the neighboring state of Maryland and have plans to branch out on the East Coast. And they're planning to roll out edible medicinal marijuana products this summer.elm/acb/ec"

They are at a high risk of complications, but planned medical assessment before the fasts can help them follow Ramzan fasting with minimal complications.Dr Shailesh Pitale, diabetologist, says otherwise also diabetics should avoid long meal gaps but during Ramzan the gap is inevitable. ""Those suffering from diabetic complications, those with labile control and those on multiple insulin doses as well as those engaged in intense physical work should surely avoid fasting. Also, pregnant women and young children too should avoid fasting. However, other diabetics with good blood sugar control and minimal oral doses just need to see their doctors and get their doses adjusted,"" he said.In diabetics, risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) increases 4-8 times and hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) increases 3-5 times while fasting. Also due to inadequate fluid intake, dehydration is common. Syncopes, falls, injuries, fractures and blindness due to thrombosis of the retinal vein are common effects of diabetes.Diabetics like Shakir Ali, 63, believe anyone can maintain good blood sugar control with his will power and self-control. A retired manager from Vijaya Bank, Ali says he had been keeping Rozas since 25 or more years while being a diabetic, of course, with regular medicines. ""It is every Muslim's duty to fast during Ramzan. If we are strong, we can surely contain the disease. There is nothing wrong in seeing a doctor in serious condition. I don't change my dosages of medicines,"" he said.Endocrinologists and diabetologists suggest a reduction in morning dose and an increase in evening dose of medicine. ""Also, during fasting the patient needs to be put on different drugs. There are certain drugs that cause hypoglycaemia and can be avoided. Patients should be watchful about various symptoms of rise or fall in the sugar levels and not stay alone at any point of time during the fasting so help is available whenever needed. Patient and relatives should be educated about symptoms of hypo and hyperglycaemia, like giddiness, blackouts, sweating, blurring of vision, cold extremities,"" he said.Dr A H Madan, professor and head of eye department at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), says that eyes (retina) may be affected badly in diabetics if proper care is not taken. Hence, like other medicines, patients should also use eye drops to prevent permanent damage to eyes.Dos and don'ts Take more protein rich food and avoid simple sugar and carbohydrate rich foods Fruits should be taken in larger quantity after sunset Adequate water and fluids without sugar should be taken At dawn, foods that cause slow and steady rise in blood glucose levels like barley, wheat, oats, millets, semolina, whole grain bread, fruits with skin, figs, almonds and fibre rich foods (beans, sprouts, leafy vegetables) should be taken Tea and coffee should be avoided since they lead to fast fluid loss Normal physical activity can be done during the day while avoiding excessive activity a few hours before sunset Eyes should be frequently washed to prevent dryness"

They are going to remain stable in the long run, he said. It seems that the government wants to conserve sugar domestically in view of an expected fall in sugar production in the next 2016-17 sugar season, he added.Notably, due to delayed harvest in Brazil, there has been a rise in international prices, which has made exports of Indian sugar feasible as well. India has so far exported 1.6 million tonnes in the marketing year that began on October 1.Under criticism after sugar prices surged to around Rs. 40 per kg from Rs. 30 per Kg 6-7 months ago in most parts of the country, the Centres latest decision of imposing export duty on sugar will deter exports and is likely to help keep sufficient availability of sugar in domestic market.Symbolic gestureThe governments decision seems to be more of a symbolic gesture as surge price is not going to significantly come down. Prices will have a marginal downward impact, but not a significant one, Mr. Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President at ICRA  the credit rating services company told The Hindu .Mr. Majumdar said that even before the governments decision on sugar export duty, countrys export since April-May had started falling due to strengthening of local prices on expectations of lower output in coming season."

This would in turn put pressure on the state to auction sugar and make payment to farmers, sources close to the development said.For instance, Shri Tatyasaheb Kore Warna Cooperative Sugar Mill Ltd in Kolhapur district has not paid Rs 102 crore as per the report finalised on April 30. The management is now charged for non-payment of sugarcane purchase price and fined for Rs 66.9 crore.""The management is already unable to pay Rs 102 crore. From where are they going to pay another Rs 66.9 crore? This question would clear the air on the entire issue, where the state government is trying portray itself as pro-farmer by initiating such action against a handful of factories,"" said Vilas Zunjar, veteran journalist from Kolhapur city.Sachin Raval, regional joint director, sugar commissionerate, Kolhapur said, notices have been issued to the sugar mills as per the government's directives.While some factories such as Chhatrapati Shahu Kagal Cooperative Sugar Mill, Jawahar Cooperative Sugar Mill and Lt Sadashivrao Mandlik Cooperative Mill have paid the entire sugarcane purchase price as per their respective FRP formula, the other factories will release their funds to farmers in next 10 days.""If these sugar mills do not pay farmers as per the notice, most of them would lose their crushing licence. Every factory has to apply for crushing licence every year with the sugar commissionerate. Such defaulting factories would not get licence,"" he said.There are some 50 cooperative and private sugar mills in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, which crush 20% of the total sugarcane cultivated in the state. The dues in Sangli and Kolhapur are Rs 296.35 crore and Rs 773.77 crore, respectively, as per the regional joint directors official report. By June, most of the factories would complete the payment, an official said.A senior managing director at a Kolhapur-based sugar mill said a factory crushes some 10 lakh tonne sugarcane and has at least 10,000 sugarcane cultivators as its members. All of them have already planted sugarcane for the next crushing season 2016-17 starting from November this year.""No political party can dare to hurt the farmers by closing down the sugar mill in such haste. The government, which is being lauded for its action against factory, will face the wrath for closing down the same factory within next six months. Other neighbouring factories would not purchase extra sugarcane because they have to crush sugarcane of their members first,"" the director said."

According to the policy documents accessed by The Times of India, two of Chadha group's signature firms, AB Sugar Limited and Wave Distillers and Beverages Limited, will now supply wholesale beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) in the state. The firms have Chadha's son Manpreet and Ponty's brother Rajinder as shareholders.AB Sugar has a distillery of Punjab Made Liquor (PML) or 'desi daaru' in Hoshiarpur's Dasuya town while Wave is based out of Noida, near Delhi. This year the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government has changed the concept of its five-year old licence category called L1 A, according to which, any company across India can now be nominated by liquor manufacturers (distillers, bottling plant and brewery owners) through a consent to further sell alcohol to wholesalers (L1 licence) and retailers (L2 and L 14 vends) in Punjab. Effectively, a category of superwholesalers has been created.The new L1A category has been challenged in the Punjab and Haryana high court on the ground that it encourages monopolistic practices. The creation of the category was challenged on March 22. The state government has given its reasons in an affidavit filed on April 5.Records accessed by TOI reveal that eight firms were given L1A two weeks ago. Out of them, two firms will have to purchase their stock only from Chadha's manufacturing units. Which means AB Sugar will instead distribute majority IMFL brands through a firm Primavera Agro Produce Limited based out of Amritsar, while Wave will look after the distribution of beer brands through a UP-based firm Chronicle Foods Private Limited.However, records of the Union ministry of corporate affairs reveal that the director of Wave and Primavera are one and the same with the same address as well. Director Iqbal Singh is a resident of Dharam Shala Vali Gali, Locoshed, Moradaba.The policy to introduce L1A says that ""the manufacturing company will give a consent letter to that person/company/firm/organization who is at arm's length distance from the manufacturing company, provided there is no promoter, director, partner in the manufacturing company or there is no holding, subsidiary, closely held company, fully/partially owned/ financed/managed firm/company""."

A relative humidity of 60% or more hampers sweat evaporation, which hinders body's ability to cool itself. More than temperature, exposure to the sun, especially durging heat waves, can increase the heat index by 15 degrees.""""Though, Udupi has not reported heatstroke-related cases, the district administration wants to be cautious. Heatstroke results from prolonged exposure to high temperatures, usually in combination with dehydration, and it leads to failure of the temperature control system of the body,"" she added.People who are vulnerable to heatstroke are those who live in apartments or homes that lack proper ventilation, people with chronic diseases, people taking medications, those who drink excessive amount of alcohol, infants and children up to the age of 4, and adults over the age of 65. These people adjust to heat more slowly than others. Common symptoms of heatstrokes are throbbing headache, dizziness and light-headedness, lack of sweating despite the heat, red and dry skin, muscle weakness or cramps, nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeat which may be either strong or weak, shallow breathing, behavioural changes such as contusion, disorientation staggering, seizures and unconsciousness.Drinking plenty of water is the best solution for keeping away from heat-related diseases. Avoid carbonated water (soda and aerated drinks). It is adviseable to have butter milk and tender coconut. It is better to have less amount of hot beverages like coffee and tea. Vegetarian food, which are less spicy, should be consumed more to avoid heat strokes. It would be good to wear loose, cotton, lighted-coloured clothes. Instead of shoes, sandals and slippers should be worn.""If a person is confused and speaking irrelevantly, take him to a shady cool place. Make him lie down and raise his legs. Wipe fore-head, neck, feet, and palms with cool water. Do not use cold water or ice. Make him drink water with some salt and sugar slowly and call nearby medical aid-doctor,"" Dr Rohini said."

But absence of any such measure disappointed farmers. No big announcement for the welfare of farmers was made in the governors address, he said."

With temperatures in the city too rising, doctors are already seeing children suffer from heat-related illnesses. They say that city needs to be prepared to handle the onslaught of more such cases even among the adults as this year is touted to be among the hottest years in a few decades.The maximum temperature has touched 43.6 degrees Celsius this month and temperatures being above 40 degrees most afternoons. Children, elderly and people with low immunity are especially at the danger of falling prey to heat-related diseases. Though no adults have been reported to be suffering from any of these illnesses, government hospitals in the city have already been prepared to deal with the situation.Meanwhile, parents need to take care of children as weather becomes increasingly hot.""These days, kids have their exams, extra classes or some other activities to attend all through summers. It would be good if parents and schools are mindful of not scheduling these activities during afternoons. Before summers begin, in-school activities can be taken up to inform children about hydration and not eating out during summers,"" said paediatrician Dr Girish Charde. He added that children between the ages 3 and 10 need more care as among whom high-grade fevers can cause convulsions and viral chill like symptoms.""A bigger problem can be heat pyrexia or fever resulting from exposure to heat for a long duration,"" informed paediatrician Dr RG Patil. ""We see that when dealing with such fevers, parents keep sponging off the kid's forehead with cold water. Instead, they should be sponging the entire body with tepid water. They can also wrap the whole body with a sheet and rub the child's body through the sheet to bring out the heat. They can also cover all sides of the bed with wet sheets or sacks,"" he said.The condition makes parents more scared than it ought to, believes paediatrician Dr Vasant Khalatkar. ""Just because the body temperature is high doesn't mean that the child suffers from fever. Knowing that the child has been exposed to heat helps determine if it is heat pyrexia or some other illness,"" he said.Agreed paediatrician Dr Uday Bodhankar. He said, ""Some April showers in between brought down the number of kids suffering from illness. However, children tend to be more vulnerable as they have low immunity. Also, most kids these days have low heat bearing capacity as they are not used to being outdoors a lot.""Looking at the seriousness of the illness, government hospitals have prepared special cold wards. At Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), the ward has three coolers and eight beds while the one at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) has a six-bedded ward, both of which can be extended if required.""Over the years, people have become more aware, resulting in the number of people needing treatment for heat-related illnesses reduced by a huge margin,"" said head of medicine department of GMCH Dr Vrunda Sahastrabhojanee.SOME HEAT-RELATED ILLNESSESLong exposure to sun can cause sunstroke, heat exhaustion and dehydration which lead to problems like heat rashes, cramps, swelling and heat stressIf one is too active while exposed to sun's heat for a long time, the electrolytes and fluid loss can result in dizziness, nausea and weakness. This is called heat exhaustionSunstroke causes the body to stop sweating thus losing its ability to cool itselfPREVENTIONAvoid going out when it is too hotAvoid long exposure to heat, cover head and ears while venturing outdoorsEnsure that your body remains covered as much as possible with light-coloured clothes made of cool fabrics like cottonKeep yourself sufficiently hydratedSYMPTOMSBody temperature rises above 102FHeavy sweating, drowsiness or nauseaDry and itchy skinLoss of appetiteTrouble in breathing, restlessness, irritabilityIncreased heart rateDO'S AND DON'TSInstead of carbonated drinks, depend on salt and sugar water, coconut water, sugarcane juice etc for hydrationDon't keep food uncovered and in the open as bacteria breed well in the indoor temperatures during the season spoiling the food fasterDon't exert yourself much physically.

""We are going to go from being about 18% of the global bottling volume to about 3% concentrated largely in the Asian countries and in India,"" he said.Making a specific reference to affordability in the Indian context, Quincey said that India now sells the ""cheapest, most accessible Coke you can probably buy in the world .""An overall slowdown in discretionary spends has seen cola consumption fall to single digits and Coca-Cola, like most fast moving consumer goods makers, has been accelerating strategies to penetrate rural markets . One such India launch has been a 'splash bar', a kiosk where a vendor dispenses Coca-Cola from a machine into small cups at prices as low as Rs 5. Servings start at 80-to-150 ml cups across brands including Coke, Thums Up, Fanta and Sprite. What started in 2013 with 31 splash bars run by rural women in Gujarat, has now been scaled up to 30,000-plus splash bars selling over 1.5 million cups of Coca-Cola products per day, a company spokesperson said.Quincey said some emerging markets have been performing worse than was expected. But India has ""certainly been growing and there's a lot of the focus on affordability... You can see some of the splash bars, which is the cheapest, most accessible Coke you can probably buy in the world.""The global Coke boss also added that the entry pack PET (250-ml) is a new technology , first in the world. ""The pack radically extends the shelf life of small PET... rural areas has always been a problem for anyone in PET bottles because it loses the gas. So, this is a way of really being able to extend the reach way further into the rural areas,"" he said. Affordable packs include 180 ml cans at Rs 20, 250-ml PET packs at Rs 15 and 200 ml glass bottles at Rs 12.Coca-Cola has been straddling multiple price points to bring in consumers in slow moving markets, at a time when consumption is moving towards low-sugar or diet drinks, or smaller portion sizes. ""There are a whole set of markets around the world, where the trend of income inequality continues to play out and where the necessity becomes to move from the middle to more premium offerings and more affordable offerings,"" he said.Elaborating on re-franching, Quincey said that it would mean the company transferring a lot of employees to its bottling partners.""We are going to go from about just over 120,000 employees to just under 40,000, and of those 40,000, half of them will be in the remaining bottling investment group territories that we still own. So, the core business will be somewhere around just under 20,000 employees,"" he added Coca-Cola is making a shift in how it will deal with challenges and headwinds around added sugar or total sugar consumption around the world, he added.""We are investing more in R&D, so that we can reduce the aggregate sugar content across the portfolio and promote zeros and light products, all of which will need to meet the absolute entry price of being great tasting. There is no point us developing products with whatever level of sugar if consumers don't like them because they are certainly not going to drink them,"" he said."

The administration must launch proceedings under the Revenue Recovery against the two mills to get payments quickly to farmers.Another section of farmers coming under the banner of the Kurungulam Arignar Anna Sugar Mills Cane Growers Association, led by president Peramalakudi Ramanathan, alleged that the mill was retaining Rs. 750 a tonne for the sugarcane supplied and that was depriving farmers from meeting other pressing expenses.The practice must be discontinued and all amount due to growers must be given in one go, he urged and added that the inquiry and case pertaining to embezzlement of growers money and the multi-crore scam that rocked the mill management was not moving as swiftly as expected. Decrying that, he and his association members staged a walkout.Tamilaga Revolutionary Farmers Front coordinators M. Pugalendi and Pon.

The children of such workers need better educational and residential facilities.As far as children in cities are concerned, transport is the biggest hurdle children face and experts say that this isssue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Pune: System Correcting Movement (Syscom) along with some 15 other NGOs and activists working in the field of education and human rights have come up with a 10 point agenda that will help government address the issue of out-of-school children. From special attention to children of brick kiln workers to surprise visits to schools to check attendance, the letter submitted to government is an outcome of a meeting that was held on October 12 between all NGOs working in the field.Despite the number of OOS children being so high, the government doesn't seem to take serious note of the problem, lamented officials.The government in its last two surveys had found that that 74000 children in the state are out of school.

Since there were flaws in both the previous surveys conducted by state, there is a need to find out the exact number of OOS students in the state with an authentic survey. Transport is the biggest problem that we see in OOS children from the cities.

""We have asked the local party workers to take a call on an alliance. We will not ignore their feelings,"" Danve said.The tone of contesting local elections sans Sena was set in June when the BJP state executive body met in Pune where state executive members were vociferous in their demand that Sena should exit the state government if it was unhappy.BJP's poll strategists have prepared an analytical report for the sugar belt which shows that the NCP retained its base in western Maharashtra in 2014 assembly polls even as BJP gained in the urban areas of the region. Of the 58 assembly constituencies in the sugar belt, the BJP won 19 seats -- mostly in urban areas and mainly in Pune-Pimpri Chinchwad. The Sena, on the other hand, won 12 seats. The NCP, however, succeeded in guarding its bastion by taking 16 seats.""If the BJP wants to improve in the sugar belt, it needs to take on Sharad Pawar's party on its own. The NCP was able to win at least one seat in all the five districts in Pune, Sangli, Satara, Solapur and Kolhapur. The BJP, which won most seats in urban areas, was not able to perform well in the rural parts. Shiv Sena has a small base in Western Maharashtra and it is right time for the BJP to eat into Sena's base and lock horns with the NCP,"" said a senior BJP minister. He said that if they decide to go solo in the local polls, the straight fight will be between BJP and NCP. Congress, with just seven seats in assembly from the region, has been reduced to a small player.Western Maharashtra has been the lifeline of Sharad Pawar's politics as his party dominates local bodies, the sugar and milk co-operatives and educational and financial institutes. The party controls a majority of power centres -- from municipal corporations to gram panchayats and from district central banks to village credit societies.""I am traveling in rural parts to understand the mood of party workers. We want an alliance, but not at the cost of our party's growth. BJP is capable of contesting the local polls on its own,"" said senior cabinet minister Girish Bapat.BJP's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Kakade said, ""We have already told the chief minister and state party president that the BJP is strong enough to contest on its own in a city like Pune.""BJP's Sangli MP Sanjay Patil said the BJP has developed its own strength in the region and is all prepared to gain roots in the rural parts of the region."

The organisation has also decided to stage a sit-in agitation in front of the residence of SSS leader and minister of state for Agriculture Sadabhau Khot on Tuesday.The organisation had participated in the meeting called by Chandrakant Patil last week to discuss the first instalment of sugarcane. However, the members of Sakal Sugarcane Producers left the meeting as their demands were not accepted. After the meeting, it was proposed to give fair and remunerative price (FRP) and additional Rs 175, which was accepted by everyone including Shetti, Raghunath Patil and the representatives of sugar factories.Addressing a gathering of around 5,000 farmers, the members of the organisation criticised Shetti for not taking up the issue with the government.Dada Kale, a member Sakal Sugarcane Producers, said, ""The government has not increased FRP for sugarcane in the last two years. However, the cost of production has increased owing to rise in the prices of fertilisers and labour charges. As a result, the farmers are at a loss. It was Shetti's responsibility to raise his voice in Parliament and speak for farmers, but he never called for an agitation over these issues even as we were ready to fight. He has failed as a leader, which has compelled us to set up a new organisation to fight for the farmers' demands.""Vikas Patil, another member of the organisation, said, ""All the farmers and their children from Kolhapur district are members of this organisation.

The Centre's decision would cost the state government Rs 11 per kg of sugar and Rs 16 crore for four months - from July to Oct - including the special Diwali quota.The Centre's decision came as a bolt from the blue and the state government could not come to a decision on how to bridge the gap in prices of sugar and the Central subsidy.

According to the food and civil supplies department, there are about 7,342 metric tons of sugar is distributed through the PDS every month.The food and civil supplies department has now sought the support of state government to restart sugar distribution as passing the entire rise in price to the consumers is not considered to be a viable option.According to sources the procurement of sugar by the state government is at the rate of Rs 41.70 per kg and including the transportation cost of Rs 1.28 per kg, the sugar prices go up to Rs 42.98 a kg. After deducting the central subsidy of Rs 18.50 per kg, the actual cost of sugar is Rs 24.48 per kg while sugar price at ration shop is Rs 13.50.The government has two options, either bear the extra cost or pass it on to the consumers.

According to recent guidelines of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for sugar industries, not more than 200 litres of waste water per tonne of cane crushed should be discharged from an individual sugar mill. However, a purification unit developed by NSI scientists can bring down the water usage to 160 litres per tonne of cane crushed.At present, sugar mills use fresh water for crushing cane and discharge the waste water. NSI experts have suggested two ways: to re-use waste water and save fresh water.NSI director Narendra Mohan said, ""Sugar mills do not monitor the intake and the water discharged. In order to be able to follow the CPCB guidelines, sugar mills will have to install instruments to measure the flow of water. There is water crisis in the country and the underground water table is also depleting. The need is, therefore, to save water. First step towards that would be water management and its recycling. The second step would be water purification and recycling for which we have developed a purification unit and the technique.""He said by doing so, sugar factories would not require fresh water all the time but purify and use recycled water.Talking about Uttar Pradesh which, along with Maharashtra and Karnataka, produces two-thirds of the total sugar produced in the country, Mohan said, ""In UP, 700 lakh tonnes of cane is crushed per annum and using the purification unit and techniques, 49 lakh tonnes of water could be saved which is enough for meeting the water needs of five lakh people for an entire year.""He concluded that sugar factories will incur an expenditure of 35 to 40 paise per litre to purify and recyle waste water otherwise discharged in the drains."

He said he was forced to take this decision because sugarcane cultivation did not yield him any profits but only increased his debt burden.""I had an agreement with an Erode-based sugar mill, but two-years-ago the company agreed to give only 2,250 per tonne,"" he said. ""The money too was paid after a seven-month delay, which spiked the interest on the loan,"" he said.Venkatachalam is hardly the first sugarcane farmer to veer away from the crop. Agriculture department statistics show that the acreage under sugarcane cultivation in the district has fallen by almost 30% in the past four years to around 768 hectares. There has been a steady decline in acreage when compared with 1,111 hectares under cultivation in 2014-15, 1,038 hectares in 2013-14, 1,458 hectares in 2012-13 and 1,427 hectares in 2011-12.Farmers say the glut in the global production of sugarcane in the last two years had caused prices to fall, but politicians did not come to their rescue. Neither the state nor the Centre helped them tide over the crisis when it mattered. In January, DMK chief Karunanidhi demanded the state government take initiatives and ensure that sugar companies settle the dues.Subsequently, chief minister J Jayalalithaa hiked the state advised price to 550 so that farmers would get 2,850 per tonne when added with the fair and remunerative price fixed by the Centre. But even that, farmers fear, will not end their woes as the companies are reluctant to settle even past dues. ""Now we get a price of only 2,325 a tonne of which they deduct 750 for labour and transportation leaving us with only 1,500,"" he said. This year, the sugar mill with which he had tied up with failed to collect the crop, forcing him to find another buyer.The DMK and the PMK, sensing the mood among the sugarcane cultivating community, have already announced raising the minimum support price to 3,500 per tonne and 4,000 per tonne.The farmers mainly have three complaints - sugarcane factories not honouring the government fixed price of 2,850 a tonne; factories delaying their full payment by more than six months; and their loan interests going up steadily. ""We want a government that will raise our minimum support price, force the companies to honour the price set by them or at least pay us the difference and waive off our loans completely,"" said Krishnapuram-based sugarcane farmer, M Ramalingam.While farmers have welcomed the announcements made by the political parties, they still remain suspicious about their motive. ""The crux of the issue is ensuring the companies honour this price and pay our dues regularly,"" said Ramalingam. ""This present government did raise our minimum support price marginally, but they did not make the companies honour it because they are hand in glove with companies,"" said Venkatachalam."

However, the study assumes significance because of its findings pointing at air pollution as a leading indicator for stroke. In India, more than 1.2 million people were estimated to suffer strokes every year, making it the leading cause of death and disability in rural India.Globally, about 15 million people suffer strokes every year, of which nearly 6 million die and 5 million are left disabled -including loss of vision or speech, paralysis and confusion.The Lancet study is based on analysis of data from a swathe of other studies, reports and official statistics to create a mathematical model estimating stroke risk for 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The analysis was conducted by a team of international researchers.""It is a landmark study pointing at pollution as an indicator for stroke for the first time. It is important also because there are no ideal treatment options for stroke and therefore, prevention is the best solution,"" says Dr C S Aggarwal, senior consultant, department of neurology , Ganga Ram Hospital. Findings of the study show 90.5% of the stroke burden was attributable to ""modifiable factors"" such as smoking, eating too much sugar and not exercising enough, as well as the associated health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.Doctors say changing lifestyle and habits in developing countries is a major concern for increasing burden of non-communicable diseases.The study also listed air pollution as a ""modifiable factor"", indicating efforts by the government and people can make a difference. In low and middle-income nations in Asia and Africa, almost a fifth of stroke burden was attributed to household air pollution, while a similar percentage was blamed on ambient air pollution in China and India."

An analysis of top listed companies' results, barring some exceptions, showed that net profit growth in the January-March quarter (Q4FY16) soared 40% on a yearly basis, which is the highest in the last 11 quarters.The analysis by Crisil also showed that total revenues of these 642 companies grew at 6.1%, the fastest in the last five quarters, while growth of ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation), at 15.2% was at a six-quarter high.""The performance (of India Inc) has been driven by a combination of improvement in operating performance and extraordinary gains. Without the one-offs too, bottom line growth is an impressive 17.3%,"" said Prasad Koparkar, senior director, Crisil Research. ""While aggregate top line growth was 6.1%, ebitda grew faster at 15.2%, a six-quarter high, which was aided by low commodity prices,"" Koparkar said.Data showed that during Q4FY16, these 642 companies, which represented 72% of NSE's total market capitalisation, earned a total net profit of Rs 49,349 crore from a total revenues of Rs 6.18 lakh crore. On an annual basis, during FY16 these companies earned an aggregate net profit of Rs 1.79 lakh crore, up 16.7% on FY15 from an aggregate revenue of Rs 22.98 lakh crore, which was up 2.5% on the years. These figures do noT include results by financial and oil companies, Vedanta and TCS, the last two since there were large one-offs for these companies during FY16 and hence strictly not comparable.On the sectoral front, power, airlines, IT, sugar and auto components drove net profit growth, while telecom and passenger car firms have lagged, Koparkar said. The analysis showed that airlines, power, IT and sugar industries demonstrated strong growth in ebitda. Companies in airlines, IT and auto components sectors benefited from extraordinary gains, too, which lifted aggregate net profit growth to 39.9%. Adjusted for extraordinary income, aggregate net profit growth for these companies was a more moderate 17.3%, data showed.The analysis also showed that pharmaceutical companies reported a 14% revenue growth, driven by mid-sized companies. Aggregate operating margin improved by close to 200 basis points due to better product mix and lower raw material cost, which offset higher other costs and compliance expenses, Crisil Research said.Compared to these industries which showed better performance, telecom companies showed a 9.5% revenue growth, following sharper focus on realisation and volume improvement. However, net profit margin declined 108 basis points because of higher interest expense arising from loan taken to purchase spectrum.In the automobile segment, Maruti Suzuki kept cruising, with revenue growing 12.3%, helped by a rise in realisation. However, exports dropped 8.6% and operating margin by 50 basis points on higher marketing outgo. Rise in tax and depreciation, and a fall in other income, resulted in net profit margin shrinking 200 basis points, Crisil Research said."

A key bureaucrat driving the change was Santha Sheela Nair, who was recently appointed officer on special duty (OSD) to chief minister J Jayalalithaa.In the past too, Nair has spearheaded successful government initiatives. Among them was the rainwater harvesting scheme of Jayalalithaa in 2003. As vice president of the state planning commission, Nair launched the Millets Mission programme as part of the 12th plan, 2011-16.Consumption of polished rice, which is the preference of the majority , has been identified as the key reason for lifestyle diseases like diabetes. Millets, traditionally a poor man's staple which can reduce sugar levels naturally , had been virtually wiped out from the diet of Tamils in recent decades. Nair acknowledged this at a conference hosted by the College of Food and Dairy Technology in Chennai in 2014. In her valedictory address, she had delved in detail on the necessity of millets. ""The CM is also keen on reviving consumption of traditional food grains,"" she remarked then.A series of workshops on millets and their role in diabetes prevention, overall nutritional value, and income generation was organized for self-help groups. Agricultural department officials were sensitized to the importance of millets. Under the State Balanced Growth Fund (SBGF) which tackled inter-district disparities, financial assistance was given to promote cultivation of millets - primarily as a droughtresistant crop. ""Nair herself began to consume millets and vouched for its benefits,"" said Ananthoo, a safe food activist based in Chennai, adding millet biscuits were served in official meetings with tea.Based on crop suitability and climatic conditions, schemes were designed by the planning commission so that dry districts reaped the maximum benefits. In 2013-14, the planning commission realised that traditional grain polishing equipment was removing the nutritional parts even from the millet grains. Recognising that, Nair worked with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) to finetune the huller and decrease the gap of the rolling wheels. This ensured that the polished grain still had the nutrients. Mini-mills were also commissioned specifically for millets, said an expert from SPC.This eventually won Tamil Nadu recognition from department of agriculture and cooperation, ministry of agriculture. The state won the Krishi Karman award in 2014-15 for the production of coarse cereals. Ananthoo recalled how a decade back, millets would be available only in one store in Adyar, but are now available in any street corner. ""A lot of credit for this should go to Santha Sheela Nair and the Millets Mission,"" he says. Today , millets cost `50 to `100 per kg at shops.However, Ananthoo also points out how the state still has a long way to go, as far as re-introducing millets into the poor man's diet is concerned. ""Millets are not yet available in PDS shops. The onus is on the government to take it to the masses through hostels, noonmeal scheme and balwadis,"" he said.He also says that the state should ensure availability of traditional seeds to farmers and provide them with small machines to de-husk and process millets."

The pick-up may be slow but the bottoming out has happened. From now, it (exports) will show a slow but steady rise.... It is still a situation where we have to do a lot more to allow it (exports) to pick up, Ms.Sitharaman told the media during a FICCI event on Friday.Merchandise exports have been shrinking for 18 consecutive months since December 2014 but the contraction in May 2016 at (-) 0.79 per cent was at the slowest pace since then.Sector-wise studyThe Minister said the government was studying sector-wise contraction in exports in a bid toextend help through interest subsidy and other incentives.It is a time when help will have to be extended whether in the form of interest subvention or in the form of any kind of incentives for exports. We have been looking at (exports) sectorally, she said.Sugar levyOn the 20 per cent duty imposed on sugar exports, Ms. Sitharaman said it was done to ensure greater availability of the commodity in the domestic market. We do not want any speculative rise in sugar prices, she said.Queried whether the government is mulling extending the Minimum Import Price on steel beyond August, Ms. Sitharaman said her ministry would talk about it at the appropriate moment.Merchandise exports have been shrinking for 18 consecutive months since December 2014"

Point of Sale (PoS) devices in all FPSs in Delhi were to become operational by this month, but leave installation, the government has not even finished preparing its Request for Proposal (RPF).Showcase cityAs per the plan, Delhi was to be the showcase city for the Centres project of putting in place a biometric system at all fair price shops in the country. But, despite floating three tenders, the State government failed to rope in any company to carry out the project. This is despite the fact that Delhi is one of the easiest cities to implement the project as it has 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding. The government did not have to spend anything extra in getting the biometrics of ration card holders.Pilot projectThe Capital has 2,534 FPS, with nearly 72.8 lakh people using them. By now, all of them were supposed to distribute essential commodities like wheat, rice and sugar through fingerprint or iris detection of beneficiaries. However, even the pilot project in which 42 such shops were installed with PoS machines is now gradually being withdrawn. According to a senior official, at present, only 37 FPS have functioning PoS devices.Confirming the report, Amjad Tak, Secretary-cum-Commissioner, Food and Supplies Department, told The Hindu that the office was working on a fresh RFP. Installing PoS devices in FPSs is the most important project for us; a lot of time has already lapsed. The original proposal had some major flaws, because of which bidders were not forthcoming. We are now working on a new RFP which will be out by next month, he said.Owing to repeated delays, the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDC) came in to re-visit the project, and is now co-drafting the proposal. The new RFP is going to be a robust one with a detailed note on the process of system integration as the company awarded with the project will have to install, operate and even maintain all the devices. A tender (the fourth one) will be floated soon after, he added.Criticism from CAGEven the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) of India has criticised the failure to implement the project. In its latest audit report of the Delhi government (for the fiscal 2014-15), it observed that PoS machines for verification of the eligible beneficiaries and disbursement of food grains were installed in only 42 out of 2,300 FPSs.It also highlighted problems in the pilot project. FSO (Circle 15, North district) intimated that even the PoS machines installed in the FPSs were not working efficiently as these were not user-friendly, had poor battery life and problems of mismatching of fingerprints, and poor network.Delhi is one of the easiest cities to implement the project as it has 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding"

The issue echoed in the national executive meeting of the BJP held in Allahabad last week and national president of BJP Amit Shah described it as a serious communal matter that endangered the identity of Hindus in the region. The BJP has threatened to take up this issue in the 2017 assembly elections.State government has already described the BJP claims as baseless and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav warned the BJP against spreading canard and communal passions. The GOI report underlining the fact could be one of the reasons behind the U-turn by BJP leadership on the issue.The decade-long survey exposed that rise in migration has been mainly because of economic backwardness and awareness of education and jobs in other parts. The Census of India conducts the surveys on migration patterns too along with reasons and it has found that compared to the 1991 census, migration of rural population in western UP to urban areas increased in the 2001 census while the latest data of 2011 have yet to be released.Compared to western UP, rural-to-urban migration has either been static or decreased marginally in the central region, Bundelkhand and the eastern region of the state too during the same period.The report mentions that most of the western UP districts including Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Saharanpur, Aligarh and parts of the NCR have registered economic boom in the last 20 years so people from rural areas shifted to cities leading to an increase in the migration of the rural population to urban areas."" Prices of land in Gurgaon and Noida are no less than in Delhi and Mumbai and a good number of people have sold their lands in Kairana, Shamli, Saharanpur and shifted to other and better destinations, said a senior officer in the Census department in Lucknow, adding that migration has taken place in Bihar, Rajasthan , Punjab and Kerala and Andhra Pradesh too, so why the fuss over western UP.""The BJP is playing a dangerous game. Its ministers and government authorities are well aware of the fact that migration is a natural phenomenon world over in the wake of economic reforms and transformation. It has increased in the western UP also because the land holdings are getting smaller there like elsewhere and escalating farmland crisis is forcing farmers to opt for non-farm sector options to earn livelihood. Where is the apsect of communalism in this,"" said former director of Giri Institute of Social Studies , speaking to the ToI. A former principal secretary in planning department shared with the ToI that recent decline in sugar prices and khandsari prices, tax holiday in adjoining Uttarakhand and closure of a number of steel units has led to migration of the people ."

Dr Girish told TOI, ""Type II diabetes is a major chronic disease and its prevalence is increasing, while various studies indicate that choice of carbohydrates, particularly those with low Glycaemic Index (GI) is able to assist in management or prevention of type II diabetes. Hence, objective of this study was to determine the variability in GI of popular improved and traditional varieties of rice and to find the genetic basis of GI.""He said state's 200 varieties of rice were screened of which local variety called ""Chaptigurmatiya"" was discovered, which was re-named as Chhattisgarh Madhuraj paddy-55. He said this variety has low GI with 91% of total carbohydrates and it has slow releasing sugar tendencies, which was discovered after mouse feeding trials by Chhattisgarh Council of Science of Technology.Chandel said this variety has high yield of 42 quintal per hectare and is long bold grain rice, which is white in colour. It is consumed by natives of Chhattisgarh, who claim that it is the best stomach-filler and one's appetite remains in control many hours of eating it. ""In its options, diabetic patients are advised to consume brown rice or unpolished rice, which is low in GI but its taste is still unpopular among rice-eaters hence this CGMP-55 is a blend of taste and healthy values for diabetics,"" Chandel said.It may take another year before the rice hits market."

Many nutritionists and dietitians here want Karnataka too follow suit.""We wish Karnataka government takes up the initiative keeping in mind the public health scenario. It can partially reduce consumption of highly refined food. Not just some international products, many more high fat, high sugar and refined products should be taxed. The Kerala government's move may bring about change in people's eating habits and encourage a healthy trend. But it also looks like the government is only targeting certain brands which is not fare. In fact, many Indian food items like vada, namkeen, bajji, puri among others should also come under fat tax net,"" said Sheela Krishnaswamy, president, Karnataka chapter of Indian Dietetic Association.According to Priyamvadha Chandramouli, school nutritionist and founder of start-up Almanourisher, a child nutrition and wellness firm, kids' eating pattern gets set at the age of 2-6. ""I've worked with many schools in the city and noticed remarkable changes in children's eating habits. Sometimes it's peer pressure or societal changes that make children eat calorie-rich fast food. I suggest parents not to give refined food as a reward or bribe. Instead give a hug or tell a tale that can also be considered a reward. It's only when parents make healthy changes in their own platter that the child acquires healthy eating habits,"" she added.Children's increasing appetite for cupcakes and pastries is also not so good, said Priyamvadha who is of the opinion that fat tax should be imposed across India.However, sources in the health department said it's highly unlikely that Karnataka introduces fat tax as Kerala's decision is seen a tax-drawing technique targeting middle and high income population, rather than a health initiative.According to experts, excessive consumption of high calorie food is one of the reasons for increasing cases of Type 2 diabetes among children. Dr Anjana Hulse from Apollo Hospital said one of her patients is a 10-year-old boy, who weights over 70 kg, and is suffering from Type 2 Diabetes caused mainly due to lifestyle changes. ""It's only bad dietary habits and lack of exercise that pushed him to be insulin dependent at such a young age. In fact, childhood obesity is one of the reasons for girls attaining puberty at an early stage,"" she added."

While the factory was never built, Mr. Mahajan failed to mention the land purchased by him in the election affidavits filed by him in three consecutive Assembly elections, 2004, 2009 and 2014.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday demanded Mr. Mahajans ouster from the State Cabinet, as it had with Mr. Khadse.NCP leader Digambar Patil approached the Election Commission seeking cancellation of Mr. Mahajans election for failing to provide correct information in his affidavits.In his application to the EC, Mr. Patil has claimed that hiding information in election affidavits falls under the definition of corrupt practices as per sections of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Not only his election should be cancelled, but criminal process should be initiated against him.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant alleged that the land purchased by Mr. Mahajan belonged to the Mahar (scheduled caste) community and it was illegal for the minister to purchase it.Mr. Mahajan however, has denied of any wrongdoing, claiming that he was not aware that the property was in his name.According to Mr. Mahajan, the property was purchased in the name of the company which was to set up the sugar factory.

According to GRP, the arrested men have divulged details of their vast network.On June 23, the Mughalsarai GRP had arrested a smuggler and seized several kilogrammes for opium from him. The recoveries have proved once again that the Howrah-Delhi route of the railways has emerged as the ""new silk route for drug smuggling"", the GRP said.This route is not only being used by the West Bengal and North East drug smugglers to flood this part of east UP with ganja, heroin, brown sugar, opium and other intoxicants, but also to supply it to north and western parts of the country, the GRP added.GRP inspector, Mughalsarai, Tripurari Pandey, said: ""While carrying out regular checking, the GRP personnel noticed two youths at platform no. 7 of Mughalsarai railway station. When challenged, they tried to escape but were caught near the western cabin of the station. When their bags were checked, brown sugar packed in polythene packets was found.""Pandey said the arrested drugs carriers were identified as Mohd Noor Salim Momin and Mohd Ejajul of Malda district in West Bengal. During interrogation, they divulged that one Firoz and his accomplice Mati Sheikh of Kalichak used to give them heroin and brown sugar after procuring consignments from bordering areas of Bangladesh.

58f628cb7be9e031f13af9bb,MSEDCL claims farm power use increased in drought yr,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/MSEDCL-claims-farm-power-use-increased-in-drought-yr/articleshow/53199960.cms,2016-07-14,"Maharashtra witnessed one of the worst droughts in its history in 2015-16. The kharif production fell sharply and in many areas no sowing took place for rabi crop. This has not deterred MSEDCL from claiming that the use of farm pumps increased by 7.1% in 2015-16 as compared to 2014-15. This is in spite of the fact that energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule has said on record that MSEDCL inflated farm pump consumption figures and had set up an enquiry in this regard.Consumer activists have been contesting MSEDCL's farm pump consumption figures since years. They allege that MSEDCL inflates consumption figures to manipulate distribution losses so as to avoid being penalized by Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). The activists have also pointed out that the jugglery leads to higher power tariff for all consumers.The Nagpur unit of Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (Credai) has done an in-depth analysis of MSEDCL and government data to expose the jugglery done by the discom. It presented its findings before MERC during the public hearing on Thursday. Credai consultant AP Ganguly told TOI , ""MERC projects power consumption of each consumer category for the coming year in the tariff orders. MSEDCL has claimed that the actual power consumption by farm pumps was 23% more than the MERC projection.""Ganguly said that as per MSEDCL's own figures, the actual agricultural consumption at high tension (HT) level was lower than the MERC figure. ""However, the unmetered farm pump consumption was 34% higher than the MERC's estimate while the metered consumption was 15% higher. It is clear that MSEDCL has sent farmers inflated bills,"" he charged.Reading out facts and figures to support his argument, the consultant said, ""The Economic Survey report 2015-16 has projected a 22% drop in foodgrain production with drought ravaging both kharif and rabi crops. The production of cereals was projected to decrease by 24% and pulses by 11% as per the survey. Sugar cane production was projected to drop by 21%. Some 278 out of the total 355 tehsils received deficient rainfall in 2015-16. Under such conditions, how can farm power consumption increase by 7.1%?""According to him, MSEDCL's losses were in the range of 25% and not 13% as claimed by the company in the tariff petition. ""If this fact is admitted by MSEDCL, then it will be penalized by MERC and the company will be forced to reduce the magnitude of proposed tariff hike.""Meanwhile, the enquiry against MSEDCL's farm power bills is going on. The three-member committee has appointed IIT Powai for doing field surveys to find out the actual farm power consumption. The committee is expected to submit its report to government in December this year."

Prominent in the crinkled paper is an announcement for this year's Eid release at the nearby multiplex. There's Salman Khan in his rustic wrestler's avatar half completing his dangal manoeuvre over some hapless opponent, there's the akhara sand flying all over for effect. The newspaper gently flutters, Salman too looks as if he's trembling. Intriguingly, irrespective of where you are sitting in Yogeshwar's drawing room, Salman the Pehalwan always seems upside down to you. It's like the Mona Lisa at the Louvre effect - any which way you look at it, it follows you.It is a slightly strange setting. Yogeshwar, in all his pocket-sized hulkiness, 28-inched at the waist, super shape and supremely-fit - the real deal - regards the scene with his typically quiet, sullen disdain. ""Shaaddi kisi ki, baraati koi, aur dulha koi,"" he says dismissively as if he has no time for such trivialities anymore. But uttered in his heavily-accented Haryanvi, he makes it sound all the more menacing, or comical, depending on where you stand on the Salman-Olympics ambassador issue. It was Yogeshwar who waded in headlong when the actor was controversially appointed goodwill ambassador for the Indian Olympic contingent, questioning why no sportsman was seen fit enough to be accorded the honour. He merely nods at the recent memory, not impatient, just having risen above it all.But it also immediately sets Yogeshwar apart in this whole Rio Olympics business. You could say, there's a strange Salmanization of Yogeshwar himself. It's difficult to explain how. For one, there are very few or no hangers on, but there hangs in the air a strange broodiness to Dutt that would be very typical of a Salman. The only time he breaks out into an automatic grin all day is when you comment that his Body Mass Index (BMI) would be at the lowest ever. ""No, it is still around 6,"" he says, clearly aware of how the hours spent in the gym have so spectacularly borne fruit.Without the entourage - an aspect that is so Sushil Kumar , -Yogeshwar is his own lone wolf. He seems to have wrested this mantle of the alpha male of the wrestling contingent with a quiet glee, almost as if he was waiting for the Sushil-Narsingh issue to blow up like it did, and pave the path for his elevation, as it were. ""We don't speak to each other anymore,"" he says simply, a hint of a lisp adding to the accent, on the broken friendship with Sushil. ""It was a long friendship, but that's not the case anymore. I haven't had the time also to mend any broken bridges and I just want to focus on myself. I haven't wished badly on anyone till now, and I think I'm fine where I am, so I haven't spoken to Sushil about mending things."" End of story .But it is also his strangely controversial stands, especially his poem on the JNU-Govt stand-off following the Afzal Guru sloganeering, make him something of a Twitter-vigilante, or a loose cannon, again depending on where you stand. Ironically, it makes him perhaps the only Indian sportsman who speaks out on issues, while the sense of the misguided is a throwback to the ways of the man whose appointment as his Olympic contingent's brand ambassador he so memorably questioned. ""Shaaddi kisi ki, baraati koi, aur dulha koi.""But then, we digress. Simply, Yogeshwar Dutt is in the prime form of his life. He is our one big medal hope for Rio.He pulled a muscle in his back during the morning sparring with old friend, rival and confidante Bajrangi. There was the usual silent commotion that follows such a mid-mat interruption. The impassive physio pressed and pinched trying to locate the knot, ice was crushed in an old towel and applied while others looked on and spoke in hushed tones. Bajrangi looked so worried as if he would break down but then, that could be his everyday face. ""Hota hai,"" Yogeshwar waved off the concern later, in true Bhai-style. There was nothing that could deter him to climb off his zone, where he seems so comfortably nestled in at the moment.""The day I won that bronze in London, I set myself a target, which was to claim gold at the Olympics. I wasn't satisfied with third place, and if I wanted to win gold in 2016 in Rio, I would have to begin preparations immediately. Before 2012, the dream was to just win an Olympic medal, and that disappointment of not getting gold in London has spurred me on to this day,"" he says.For someone who only first learnt of Olympics as an idea when Leander Paes won the bronze in 1996, Yogeshwar himself is a veteran of sorts. Rio will be his fourth Games and turning into a monk each time comes naturally to him now. ""I had three operations in 2015, and I was out of action for almost the whole year, but when I was injured or free from training, I was just thinking about how to prepare for Rio, how to build my legs, how to improve my strength. I also changed my weight category from 60kg to 65kg. But I did win gold at the 2014 Asian Games, and gold at any other event that I participated in. That gave me the confidence that I can do well in the 65kg category.""Kuch paane ke liye, kuch khona padta hai,"" he informs us. He says, as part of a carb-free diet, he hasn't eaten a roti in nearly two months now; there is paneer and fruits without the juice to eliminate the sugar intake. His diet is bland, he hates it, but he does it.""After the 2014 Asian Games gold, I made quite a few changes. My diet, then I started avoiding lots of things. I never went out much anyways. I rarely went home, maybe on Sundays I'd go and meet my mother and house-folk for 2, 3 hours, then I'd sleep and leave for the training centre in the morning. Talk is less. I've even asked them not to come to meet me unless there is an emergency . My phone is also switched off, and I only use it if some important work comes up.""I want that Rio gold so badly..."""

""The BJP is now known as Bharatiya Jhooti Party (party of liars),"" was the refrain of all leaders.""Modi came to power on big poll promises. Two year ago, he came to nearby Dabhadi village and promised to give farmers remunerative price for produce. Three farmers have died here waiting for Modi to keep his word. But he has not bothered to come back to see the plight of people on whom he heaped his pack of lies,"" said Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh.Addressing the farmers' rally organized by former minister Shivajirao Moghe, Singh also ridiculed Modi's claims of being a 'petty tea vendor'. ""I will give a cash reward of Rs2 lakh to any person who has bought a cup of tea from Modi. Even Modi's educational qualifications are suspect. I will also give Rs2 lakh to anyone who proves he has studied with him. A less educated PM is not an issue, but speaking lies is not proper for a PM,"" said Singh. ""Modi has been trained to tell lies by the RSS from a young age. The Sangh believes that a lie spoken aloud and repeatedly becomes a truth,"" said Singh.State Congress president Ashok Chavan, MP Raj Babbar, ex-state president Manikrao Thakre, All India Youth Congress president Amarindersingh Raja Brar and his state president Vishwajeet Kadam were among those at the rally, which was well attended despite the hot summer afternoon timing. The villagers applauded as Brar mimicked Modi and his 'string of false promises' right from depositing Rs15 lakh in banks to ending farmers suicides.In March 20, 2014, Modi, as star campaigner of the BJP, had held a 'Chai pe charcha' at Dabhadi village in Yavatmal, which was beamed live all over the country. The village is part of Moghe's constituency, where he lost the election a month after the Modi visit. ""He got away with all lies. He has fooled you once, but do not fall prey to his false promises again,"" said ex-CM Ashok Chavan.Clearly, once again all Congress leaders are fighting the one-man Modi army, who left the Congress in disarray over the last two years.Raj Babbar likened Modi to a quack at the village fair, who promises guaranteed cure for every disease, or the godman who fools and cheats people with promises of doubling their wealth but walks away with their precious belongings.Kadam said only the Congress government knows how to care for farmers. ""No one in the BJP has experience or sensitivity of dealing with such complex issues. So, it is no wonder that Modi does not mind waiving Rs1.14 lakh crore loans of wealthy industrial houses and capitalists, but shows no mercy to farmers crying out for waiver of small but crippling debts so they can stand on their feet,"" said the youth leader.Last year too, Moghe had organized a similar 'Chai ki charcha' to remind Modi of the promises he made to the people of Dhabadi.

As a mark of protest, the guest and leaders at the rally were offered black tea without sugar and milk.Kamal Nath innocent'Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the farmers' rally, AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh defended his party colleague and ex-minister Kamal Nath, who on Wednesday resigned from his recent appointment as in-charge of Punjab election campaign.""As soon as he was appointed in-charge of Punjab affairs, he was linked to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. For last 30 years, neither the then DGP KPS Gill nor the BJP raised this matter. But Kamal Nath has chosen to stay away from Punjab so that rival parties do not get chance to divert attention and focus from the major issue raised by the Congress, of how the Akalis and allies had allowed the drug menace to spread in Punjab and are making capital of it,"" said Singh. He even accused Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal of working in the interest of those seeking creation of Khalistan."

Party senior leaders Yendala Lakshminarayana, Loka Bhoopathi Reddy, Palle Ganga Reddy, Venkataramani, Muralidhar Goud and a galaxy of activists gave him a rousing reception at the district party office.Mr. Dattatreya felt that if political parties and governments kept aside politics and worked together, the welfare schemes would become successful. With the PM Fasal Bima Yojana, a large section of farmers would benefit as it drastically reduces the premium amount from 15 per cent to just 2 per cent in kharif and 1.5 per cent in rabi, he said.Claiming that there was an unprecedented change in governance in the last two years, he said that Mr. Narendra Modi built a scandal-free India for the first time. There were no scandals while development was fast and full during the BJP rule, he said. The recent ILO meeting attended by the representatives from all countries was in praise of the fastest economic growth rate in India and also the good governance, he added.He promised to talk to the State Labour Minister Nayini Narsimha Reddy and also the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, on reopening of the Nizam Sugar Factory at Bodhan and also payment of arrears to cane farmers and factory workers. He expressed his sympathies to the plight of both the communities. In a reply to a question, Mr. Dattatreya said that defections in the State were unethical and undemocratic. They were not good in a newly-formed State, he said."

The CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (CSIR-IHBT) at Palamapur, Himachal Pradesh, claims to have a developed a brand of tea, called tea-wine, with a 7-12 per cent alcohol content by volume. That makes it much boozier than beer and to be in the same league as the conventional grape-derived wine.Catechins are the key active ingredient in tea and said to possess antioxidants that make body cells more resilient to degradation. Freshly picked green leaves of tea contain almost 30 per cent catechin. Tea also contains theanine and caffeine that provide the kick most associate with the drink. Sanjay Kumar, Director of the CSIR-IHBT, said at a new conference that the tea-wine would be high on catechins and therefore was a health drink. The alcohol would be sourced from fermenting berries local to the region and four varieties of tea-wine with varying sugar content were to be developed.Excise problemsThe CSIR-IHBT had signed an agreement with a Mozambique-based company and expected production to begin next year. A similar agreement with an Indian company hadnt yet seen tea-wine bottles roll out owing to excise problems, he said. Mr. Kumar didnt disclose the financial terms or the names of the companies involved. I see it as an export product, said Mr. Kumar, that may be popular among niche groups. India is one of the biggest exporters of tea and despite Indians growing appetite for coffee, tea remains the most consumed beverage. Four in five urban Indians consume tea as opposed to 8 per cent coffee drinkers, according to a survey by the National Sample Survey Organisation.Himachal Pradesh is known for a variety of tea called Kangra Tea thats distinct from tea sourced from the North-east and South India.We are developing the tea-wine with the Kangra variety, said Mr. Kumar, and there is also a non-alcoholic version thats much superior to iced tea.This isnt the CSIRs first tryst with manufacturing alcoholic beverages. In 2003, the National Botanical Research Institute, a CSIR body, announced that it had developed a herbal beer with several medicinal properties and an alcohol content of 2-3 per cent. Though the technology was licensed to a Kanpur-based company, its yet to become a commercial product.Born out of necessityHowever, tea-wine was born out of necessity and the need to develop innovative products that could weather problems in Indias tea plantations that are grappling with reduced manpower. Being a labour-intensive crop, the IHBT said in a statement, its tender apical bud and subtending two leaves needed to be picked at the right stage by trained pluckers.Owing to labour shortage in plantations, the tea leaves werent being plucked at the right time, and this affected their quality and resulted in poor prices at auctions."

It will help contain price spikes that prove difficult to manage and taxed NDA's political management last year."

While the two are completely extreme conditions, they are both known to cause a lot of discomfort.Researchers from Bengaluru and Dresden in Germany have found that the same sugar (trehalose) protects cells from two problems they face  dehydration and freezing  in two extremely different climatic conditions.Tests on yeast cells and roundworms have shown that they survive extreme dehydration by packing their cells with trehalose and that the same also protects cells from freezing or thawing, a finding pegged to have significant practical implication in biotechnology.Hypothesising that the Glyoxylate Shunt might be conserved across kingdoms of life, the researchers teamed up to prove their idea in two vastly different organisms - worms and yeast.An important outcome of this research lies in stimulating future studies on the role of the Glyoxylate Shunt in drought resistance in plants. Alternatively, this work could also be useful in the field of cryogenic preservation.Stating that although they already knew how trehalose is produced, researchers said: ""...what remained unknown till now, was how cells redirect their energies towards making this protective molecule.""The work by scientists from the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bengaluru and the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG), Germany, published in the journal eLife, identifies the well-known text-book pathway called the 'Glyoxylate Shunt', as the main conduit for directing resources into trehalose production. Leading the German team was Teymuras V Kurzchalia.""In the growth phase, the chief metabolic processes in cells are focussed on generating energy and manufacturing material for reproduction,"" it reads, adding that during this time, trehalose generation is unnecessary.However, when preparing to tide over harsh conditions such as dehydration, cells need to funnel material and energy into synthesising trehalose. The Glyoxylate Shunt, known to function in bacteria, fungi, round worms and plants, is recognised now as a powerful pathway that can rewire and divert resources towards making protective molecules like trehalose.Therefore, when a cell needs to switch metabolic gears from a reproductive mode into a mode preparative to surviving dehydration, this pathway provides a very important switch.Although the Glyoxylate Shunt has long been known to operate in these organisms, especially in plants during seed germination, its actual biological function remained elusive.""One of the most exciting things about this study is that we have shown that the Glyoxylate Shunt has an essential physiological function. It plays a crucial role in providing organisms with the protection they need to survive dehydration,"" Sunil Laxman, one of the authors of the paper said.Besides helping cells survive dehydration, trehalose has also been found to be beneficial in protecting cells during freezing and thawing.""Freezing exerts similar stresses on cell membranes as dehydration does. Since trehalose also protects against cell injuries caused by freezing and thawing, our research can have very practical applications in biotechnology, especially in studying cryogenic survival,"" Laxman said.He added that his team is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms of how the Glyoxylate Shunt is regulated, and how it co-ordinates with other metabolic pathways to balance various functions in the cell, especially under conditions such as dehydration or freezing."

If UP does so, it will have examples from at least 12 other states where officers of 1983 or even later batches are heading the bureaucracy.In UP, too, the race seems to be between officers of 1982 and 1983 batches. A highly placed source told TOI that there was an unanimity at the top level about the appointment of the 1983 batch officer and the present principal secretary, finance, Rahul Bhatanagar.But the appointment had to be put on hold after an official of the secretariat pointed out that appointing him as chief secretary, the government would entail a reshuffle in which 13 principal secretaries-five of the 1982 batch and eight of the 1983 batch-will have to change places, at a time when assembly elections are nearing and developmental agenda is in full swing.With the lobbying for the post getting momentum, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav deferred the selection and said he would take the call on the appointment when he returns from abroad.Till then agriculture production commissioner Pravir Kumar has taken the charge as acting chief secretary.However, sources say bthat it has now transpired that the input given to the chief minister about Rahul Bhatnagar was not entirely correct as he is the senior most officer of his batch of 1983, so only five officers of the 1982 batch would be affected while only two of them are in the secretariat.Pravir Kumar and Deepak Singhal are in the race for the coveted post, while officials from the 1983 batch are confident too that their hard work in the last four years would not go in vain.Pravir Kumar helmed the CM's dream projects in Lucknow, including Metro train CG city, 102 Ambulance Service and JP Narain Centre , while Deepak Singhal led the river rejuvenation programme reclaiming 100 ponds in 100 days in the Bundelkhand region.

The inquiry is expected to complete in a fortnight, said MPCB officials.The Panchganga basin has eight sugar mills and four distillery units, and each factory has different sugarcane capacity. Every year, factories apply to the MPCB for permission to crush specific quantity of sugarcane each day. The quantity of pollutants generated during sugar production is proportionate to the crushing capacity.Chokalingam has instructed the MPCB officials to review the compliance of factories which were under scanner for their pollution record... The officials must visit, review the status and take stern action if the factories are failing to curb pollution. Earlier, the MPCB had forfeited bank guarantees of a few factories. Now, the officers must check whether these factories are again engaged in pollution. If so, cases under the pollution act have to be registered against them, Chokalingam told the officials.He has also advised the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the Ichalkaranji Municipal Council to complete the sewage treatment plants at the earliest. ""The civic bodies have to complete the task on a war-footing. Instead of releasing treated water in Panchganga River, the civic bodies must convince farmers in the areas to use the water for agriculture,"" Chokalingam said.The divisional commissioner also asked the officials from the MPCB and the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation to survey sewage treatment plants of Gokul Shirgaon and Shiroli MIDC areas. Besides, he has asked the district administration to review the status of the treatment plant at Chhatrapati Pramila Raje civic hospital and suggested to register every doctor in the district for medical waste treatment facility.Uday Gaikwad, environment activist, welcomed the instructions from the divisional commissioner to curb pollution. However, he raised doubts about effective implementation. ""Considering past actions, I am sceptical about the outcome of these instructions. Earlier, the MPCB closed a couple of sugar factories in the basin over pollution issue. The factories then went to higher authorities of the MPCB and regained permissions. If this practice continued, the instructions will remain on the paper,"" he said.The KMC is yet to commence operation of the Kasba Bavda sewage treatment plan to its full capacity to treat 76 million litres of waste water per day. The plant is operating at 70% of its capacity. Besides, the Dudhali plant to treat around 20 million litres of water is not yet completed. The civic body has to link 12 'nullahs' to arrest the sewage water from reaching the river. These three crucial projects are progressing at a snail's pace for the past four years."

Since the bagasse comes from sugarcane supplied by farmers, the farmers should get a share of the income from sale of power.Shetti raised the demand during a meeting of the sugarcane price control board in Pune on Saturday. He said, ""Currently, sugar mills are paying sugarcane purchase price to farmers, when the latter has rights on the mill's earnings from other byproducts as well. For a farmer, his crop is most important and it engages the farm for almost one-and-a-half years. If mills cannot pay a higher sugarcane purchase price then they should share with farmers the income received through molasses, cogeneration and other byproducts.""Bagasse is made into blocks for combustion in thermal power generation units. This power is purchased by the state power utility as a policy to support farmers.The representatives of sugar mills in the sugarcane price control board have not yet commented on the demand.While most of the cogeneration projects are concentrated in western Maharashtra, there have been many cases from the same region of non-payment to farmers by mills."

He said the scheme would improve health of women as they won't have to inhale smoke from hearth as studies have shown these fumes were equivalent to smoke from about 400 cigarettes.Modi said the overwhelming response to his call to give up LPG subsidy indicated that the country is not only developing but transforming as well. ""The attitude of reserving another seat in buses just to keep it vacant for their comfort seems to have gone now.

Our deparment was told to procure more pulses for buffer stock,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.This year's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of pulses for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, while the rabi procurement is still going on, he added.To boost domestic supply, Paswan said, ""The finance minister also said that imports via public and private agencies should be strengthened to meet the deficit.""The government has decided to send a team immediately to pulses-growing nations like Myanmar and Africa to explore government-to-government imports, the food minister said.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as chief economic adviser, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also envinced interest to supply lentils to India.Besides pulses,, sugar and wheat was also discussed at the meeting.Tomato prices have more than doubled to rule as high as Rs 100 per kg due to crop damage. Potato prices have also been on the rise.Paswan informed in the meeting that the price rise in tomato was a ""seasonal"" factor and the commodity cannot be stored due to short shelf-life unlike wheat and rice.He also informed that his ministry is keeping a close watch on prices of pulses, sugar, wheat, tomato and other essential food items.The country had imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.The ministers discussed the progress made in imports of pulses as well as reviewed the buffer stocks position and lifting by state governments for retail distribution at subsidised rates.The government has procured 1.15 lakh tonnes pulses directly from farmers as of now for creating a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes this year. It is also importing pulses through state-owned trading agencies like MMTC. So far, 38,500 tonnes of lentils have been contracted for import.The wholesale price inflation data released on Tuesday showed vegetable prices rising sharply to 12.94 per cent. Pulses inflation has remained in double digits since January 2015 and stood at 35.56 per cent in May.The meeting also discussed ways to better procurement, and increase in sowing area, taking action against hoarders, and improve transparency in functioning of private importers.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as Chief Economic Advisor, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution. However, not many states have shown interest.""The Centre is offering to state governments the un-milled tur and urad from the buffer stock at Rs 66 per kg for retail distribution at not more than Rs 120 in order to provide relief to consumers."

Ramanujaya on Tuesday sought to know whether it was possible for any individual to maintain the blood sugar levels of 120 to 126 even after fasting for one week.We have the medical reports of Mr. Padmanabham that indicate that his blood sugar levels were stable even after his week-long hunger strike at his residence in Kirlampudi in February. If any qualified medical doctor says that there is a possibility of maintaining such blood sugar levels even after sitting on genuine fast, I will quit my position and politics as well, he said while addressing a press conference here.Lambasting Mr. Padmanabham for dancing to YSRC president Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddys tunes, Mr. Ramanujaya advised Kapus not to be misled by Mr. Padmanabham and Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy, as the State government was conducting a series of programmes for their welfare.Mr. Padmanabham is trying to garner the support and sympathies of the Kapu leaders. But why he is not approaching any of the Kapu leaders from the Telugu Desam Party, he wondered, and said that the reason was nothing but the agitation was being sponsored by the Opposition.Mr. Ramanujaya was here to explain the various welfare programmes launched by the corporation for the benefit of the community. The response from the beneficiaries, however, was lukewarm.Initially, it was planned to conduct the programme in Ambedkar Bhavan. As the turnout was low, the venue was shifted to the mini-conference hall at R&B guest house."

The need of the hour is that Indian sugar mills produce raw and refined sugar varieties to compete in the global market. ""The expert team including Malcom Topfer, Director of Sugar Knowledge International Limited in UK, Michael Saska, ex-professor, Audobon Sugar Institute, University of Louisiana in US, Dr Jan Zhang from Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane and A Chudasama, editor of International Sugar Journal in UK deliberated that the need of the hour is that the refined sugar be produced as the buyers for the same were increasing in the global market.Malcom Topfer said that there are no sugar mills in the UK but raw sugar is purchased and refined before being sold there. He said that refined sugar is better in quality than the sugar produced from sulphitation process.Prof Narendra Mohan, Director, NSI, informed that sugar produced from sulphitation by the Indian sugar mills is inferior in quality than the refined sugar. ""Sugar should be branded and sold in packets just like salt is available as a packaged item."""

58f63a36a3d24b0b70c29397,What to eat while expecting,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/What-to-eat-while-expecting/article14990797.ece,2016-09-21,"Celebrity dietician-turned-author Rujuta Diwekar has teamed up with Bollywood diva Kareena Kapoor and recently launched the first of a three-part series of Facebook Live interactions where the two bust myths on pregnancy diets and stressed on the importance of eating local produce.The author of the popular book, Don't Lose your Mind, Lose Your Weight has been Kapoors dietician for a decade. Diwekar has been tracking Kapoors diet closely through her pregnancy and plans to compile the series of live interactions into a book.Diwekar, who has charted a strict diet which the actor will have to follow, says pregnancy makes a woman crave for healthy food naturally. No wonder then that Kapoors craving of late has been the notorious karela. Everyone suggests I add a little sugar to it and the bitterness goes, but I dont like that. I like that it has a bitter, pungent taste to it. Its something that I enjoy, says the 35-year-old actor.Known for promoting an Indian diet in her book, Women & the Weight Loss Tamasha , Diwekar firmly believes that breaking down food into proteins, carbohydrates and fat is erroneous. The new mantra, according to the dietician, should be farmer, retailer and consumer, which takes into account where your food comes from. Its important to eat food that helps the local economy as well, says Diwekar, while dismissing several dietary fads that have been imported from the west.Agreeing with her dietician, Kapoor eats produce that is locally grown and sourced. The actor experiments with a mix of vegetables. We have such a variety in India. You could eat something as simple as beetroot sabzi with jowar roti, and it is a wholesome meal, explains Kapoor.The duo has also released a mental meal map which promises to help people eat the right amount and prevent wastage of food. The first step in the map is to visualise the quantity of food one wants to eat. Then you serve yourself half of it. The final step is to take double the time you take to eat to finish this portion, and if youre still hungry by the end of this, then you could repeat the process. This must be supplemented with exercise, even when pregnant, emphasises Diwekar.According to Kapoor, a pregnancy does not force a woman to put her life on hold. Getting pregnant is not like getting an inflammation. I will continue to do normal things, says Kapoor who practises yoga and walks to keep fit. Encouraging her celebrity client, Diwekar explains that women are at their energetic best when pregnant. Much before female Olympic athletes took steroids, they got themselves pregnant to enhance their performance, claims Diwekar.The duos second Facebook live interaction will take place in November. Both Kapoor and Diwekar support the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation in declaring 2016 as the year of pulses."
