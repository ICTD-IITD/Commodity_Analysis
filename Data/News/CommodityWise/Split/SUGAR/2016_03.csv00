This year, sugar prices are high and there is a good demand of sugar at international rates. In addition to this, sugarcane production has reduced in the state. Considering all these aspects, factories can afford to pay Rs 3,500 per tonne to the produce. The state needs to consider the increase in production costs each year while revising FRP prices,"" Patil said.According to the rule, the state fixes the FRP based on how much sugar is recovered after crushing one tonne of cane.""We are spreading awareness among farmers about this and we expect support from all across the state including western and southern districts that produce sugarcane. If the state is ready to pay us as per our demands, we are ready to sell our produce. Otherwise, we will not allow any sugar factory to take our crop for crushing,"" he said.According to the state's decision, the crushing of sugarcane season will be starting from December 1 and all the sugar factories will start crushing from December 1.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana and sugar factories have demanded that government should start crushing season either on November 15 or November 1 stating that this will affect the recovery of sugarcane crop.Speaking on the issue, Patil said, ""We have no objections as to when to start the season for sugarcane crushing. The state is free to take decisions regarding this which will benefit farmers. Along with this, we expect that the state should take a decision regarding the FRP and declare Rs 3,500 per tonne for sugarcane."""

A new proposal for taking up a project for large-scale production of coconut sugar has been mooted by the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI).While Neera, a health drink made from the inflorescence of coconut palms, did complement the efforts for value-addition of coconut, it has not been able to make the desired level of profitability due to several reasons. It is in this context that researchers in the sector are proposing coconut sugar production as an alternative, perhaps a better one, to improve the farmers income.CPCRI Director P. Chowdappa says that coconut sugar made from sap has good demand in the market. The product has a low glycemic index of around 35, almost half that of ordinary sugar. Blood glucose levels may not rise much due to consumption of coconut sugar. Thus, the product is a better option for people having problems associated with diabetes, he says.NeeraThe opposition to Neera among some sections of people could be an impediment to the plans for its promotion, according to him.Neera has to be produced in a time-bound manner under special supervision to guard it against fermentation into toddy.It has to be either vacuum packed or refrigerated. Production of coconut sugar does not pose such problems.With a lower glycemic index, coconut sugar may be a better choice for peopleCoconut sugar made from sap has good demand in market"

They are demanding reservation in education and employment. Photo: S SudarshanOn July 13, a 15-year-old girl in Maharashtra was alleged to have been brutally gang-raped and killed by three men who were drinking liquor to celebrate the purchase of a motorcycle. When her body was found by her villagers, who were mostly from the Maratha community, her private parts had been mutilated, her hair pulled out by hand, and her hands and teeth broken. She did not make it to the hospital alive.The incident happened in the Kopardi village of Ahmednagar district, around 300 km south east of Mumbai, and shocked the State. All three men were arrested a few days later, but the latent anger prevalent among the Maratha community since the previous Congress-NCP government passed a law in 2014, giving the community 16 per cent reservation in education and jobs, without transgressing on OBC reservation, was evident.Last-ditch sopThe law was widely perceived as a last-ditch sop by a government on its last legs, intended to appease the politically influential Maratha community. Not much had happened since then, but when the rape-and-murder came to light, Kopardi became a powder keg for the community to agitate. The community decided  surprisingly without the support of any political party or any leader such as Hardik Patel in Gujarat who is leading the reservation agitation for the Patidar community  to hold silent rallies (muk morcha in Marathi) across the State. Such has been the groundswell since the first rally in August that the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP-Shiv Sena government has had to sit up and take notice.These rallies are like a Maratha Arab Spring, says Praveen Gaikwad, who heads the Sambhaji Brigade, a vocally pro-Maratha outfit that is said to be behind the rallies, even though there is no official organiser.The notion gaining currency in the media is that political leaders or parties are behind it. This is wrong. On the contrary, several of them are attempting to take credit now that these agitations have struck a chord across Maharashtra. Marathas are among the most influential communities in the State, accounting for about 34 per cent of Maharashtras population. Since the formation of Maharashtra on May 1, 1960, Maratha Chief Ministers have governed the State for around 30 years.The States cooperative sugar movement, easily one of the strongest agricultural lobbies in the country, influences politics like no other industry does and is dominated by Marathas. Milk cooperatives, and cooperative banks, too, wield a large influence in State politics as well as policy-making. Both these industries are run primarily by Marathas.One of the first rallies, held in Aurangabad district on August 10, was the turning point. Locals said they expected only 5,000 people. More than a lakh turned up, thus setting the template for future silent agitations that have only grown in strength. The Aurangabad rally was held after the authorities denied permission for a rally in Mumbai.Women leading protestsAlmost every silent rally is led by women and they account for nearly 30 per cent of the protesters.Their demands: implementation of the reservation law, amendment to the Prevention of Atrocities against SC/ST Act, and death penalty to the accused in the Kopardi case."
58f640047be9e031f13b11fd,Boxing: Boxing revolution at Rio Olympics,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/boxing/Boxing-Boxing-revolution-at-Rio-Olympics/articleshow/53360288.cms,2016-07-24,"Rio de Janeiro, July 24, 2016 (AFP) -Five key elements to know about boxing before the Rio Olympic Games:+ Boxing in Rio will be very different from all the Olympics that have gone before. Most controversially, it will be the first time professional boxers are allowed to take part. But don't expect to see the big names in boxing. In fact, there will likely be only a handful of professionals competing and few will be names most boxing fans have heard of. Critics say that pitting professional pugilists against amateurs could result in serious injury. International Boxing Association (AIBA) president Wu Ching-Kuo -- who pushed for their inclusion -- says that allowing the pros only means boxing is finally doing what almost all other Olympic sports did years ago.+ That is not the only major change to Olympic boxing. Another big difference is that male fighters will no longer wear headguards (they have done so at Olympics since the 1980s). Women fighters will still wear them. Most in the fight game support the ditching of headwear after the AIBA said extensive studies found that there were actually fewer concussions without headguards. Fans of the move also say that for purely aesthetic reasons boxing just looks better. Critics say there are likely to be more cuts as a result -- and with so many fights packed into a fortnight, competitors will have little time for those wounds to heal between bouts. That means we could see plenty of blood.+ And that is not all. The deeply unpopular punch-counting system of scoring -- which has thrown up numerous controversies over the years -- has also been ditched to again bring Olympic boxing closer into line with professional bouts. Now ringside judges will use the ""10-point must system"", with the fighter that wins the round getting 10 points and the other between six and nine. For example, a 10-9 round means that it was close. Boxing -- and Olympic boxing in particular -- has been notorious down the years for some questionable decisions. Don't expect this time to be any different despite the new system.+ Some of the world's finest boxers launched their careers at the Olympics. A certain Cassius Clay -- later to call himself Muhammad Ali -- won gold at the Rome Olympics in 1960. Other notable Olympic boxers who went on to stardom include Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield, Oscar De La Hoya, Lennox Lewis and Floyd Mayweather. The latest is Anthony Joshua, Britain's heavyweight gold medal winner from 2012 who is unbeaten as a pro and ploughing his way through the division. That said, there are plenty of fighters who were brilliant Olympians but flopped as pros -- think the widely ridiculed Audley ""A-Force"" Harrison, Britain's 2000 gold medal winner.+ Olympic boxing will span almost the entire two weeks in Rio and 13 categories -- three weight classes for women and 10 for men. It is just the second time in Olympic history that women will take part. Since its inclusion in the Olympic programme in 1904, boxing has been staged at each edition of the Games, except in 1912 in Stockholm -- because Swedish law did not allow the sport. The United States, Cuba and Britain are the most successful countries.afp"

We will show phase-I of Ganga cleaning in October 2016, while the second phase will be completed two years later. The programme is entirely funded by the Centre, but we are working with cooperation of states concerned,"" water resources minister Uma Bharati said. These projects are in addition to big projects that involve the setting up of new sewage treatment plants (STPs) in various cities of UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.Tenders for 10 such big projects will be floated by July 31.

Referring to 'Moksha Dham' works, which relate to construction/repair of crematorium located along the river, Gadkari said the projects would be implemented without hurting public sentiments attached to the river even as air and water pollution is kept under check.On the issue of tanneries, sugar mills, distilleries and other industrial units in Kanpur adding to pollutants in the river, he said: ""The issue has been studied and the detailed project reports have been prepared to tackle the same. The schemes have been worked out with co-operation of states, taking them into confidence."""
58f641857be9e031f13b13fa,22 sugar factories in district get revenue recovery certificates,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/22-sugar-factories-in-district-get-revenue-recovery-certificates/articleshow/53372634.cms,2016-07-25,"KOLHAPUR: As many as 22 sugar mills in the state have received revenue recovery certificate from the sugar commissionerate after the sugarcane arrears declined to Rs 165 crore.The action initiated by the government is a technical procedure for payment of dues. Another 11 mills have also lost their licence to crush cane because of their delay in making payment before the deadline.State cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh said, ""The dues are from 2015-16 cane crushing season that ended in April this year. The total amount due was Rs 167 crore but Rs 2 crore was distributed to farmers. Thus reducing the amount to Rs 165 crore.""He made the information public during the ongoing session of state assembly and legislative council.In December last year, the government decided to go ahead with the 80:20 formula, where 80% of the total sugarcane purchase amount was asked to be paid as first instalment to the farmers. The decision was taken because sugar mills had expressed their inability to pay complete amount for sugarcane purchased based on Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) formula laid by the Union government. There are 11 sugar mills in the state that have failed to pay the sugarcane cultivators as per the formula finalised by the state government and farmers' organisations. Pune division alone has dues worth Rs 89 crore.""The state based sugar mills produced 84 lakh tonnes of sugar. In March this year, the prices of sugar started rising and reached Rs 32 per kg in April. Worried by the sudden increase, the union government restricted the stock size and forced the traders to sell sugar into the market. The wholesale dealers in sugar are now allowed to stock upto 5,000 quintals, while retailers can stock only 500 quintals,"" Deshmukh said.The Maharashtra State Cooperation Bank (MSC Bank) has already set the sugar valuation in the state at Rs 3,200 per quintal (minimum price for trading). This benefits both the sugar mills as well as sugarcane cultivators. The former will earn more out of it and some amount can be utilised for payment of arrears to sugarcane cultivators. A rough calculation estimates that a sugarcane cultivator would get Rs 85 per tonne extra than the earlier estimated price of Rs 1,875 per tonne.""As a routine practice, the MSC bank from time-to-time decides the valuation of sugar, which is used as a bar for trading. Based on the valuation, the factories can calculate their income and release the stock in the market.Sources from the state government pointed out that rainfall has been good in the state so far, which means the festival season could be a good opportunity for enhancing business. Festivals are a major booster for the economy and there is more demand for sugar from confectionaries and beverage units.EoM/NDThe state based sugar mills produced 84 lakh tonnes of sugar. In March , the prices of sugar started rising and reached Rs 32 per kg in April.Worried by the sudden rise, the union govt restricted the stock size and forced the traders to sell sugar into the market."
58f64294a3d24b0b70c299e8,Still missing in Mullaitivu,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Still-missing-in-Mullaitivu/article15419824.ece,2016-10-01,"There was a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making smallsums of money. Now that has become impossible.-Edel Queen, residentThe last time Mary Sabamalai saw her son Mayuran was in 2008, when he came home for his 21st birthday.This was about a year after she surrendered him to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), during the final stages of their battle against the Sri Lankan armed forces. Mayuran went missing in 2009.Since then, Mary has been to different government offices in Mullaitivu and outside, carrying his photograph. Tall and lean, he is dressed in white formals, sporting a tie. Not a day passes without Mary, 52, wondering about Mayuran, the eldest of her four sons. She has two daughters. Her husband, now in his sixties, is a fisherman who takes up other odd jobs occasionally. Some months ago, Mary petitioned a presidential commission looking into cases of missing persons. I got an acknowledgement saying they have received my letter, but that is all, she says.Mayuran, she firmly believes, is alive somewhere.Kamala (name changed) knows how to keep her four-year-old busy. Look, the hens are running. Catch them, she tells him, just so that he would move away from her bicycle that stands slanted. Her trick works. But three minutes later, little Mukesh (name changed) squats behind the rear wheel and looks at her through its spokes. He giggles quietly, sensing her fake anger.It is not often that Mukesh gets to play with his mother. On most days, Kamala sees him for barely two hours after she returns from work. I usually leave at six in the morning and get back by 7 at night, says the 25-year-old. It was past lunchtime that Saturday and she had not heard from the farm where she is employed. The days labour fetches her Rs.600 (roughly INR270), if she picks a sack-full of groundnuts and shells as much. On some weeks she gets called for work all seven days. Like Kamala, many in Mullaitivu work in kachchaan or groundnut farms, as farm hands. The district accounts for the second highest share of groundnuts produced in the country. But that is not what Mullaitivu is best known for.The dogs of warHome to nearly 1.3 lakh people, mostly Tamils, the town located on Sri Lankas north-eastern coast paid heavily during the three-decade-long civil war that ravaged the Tamil-dominated Northern Province. Its residents, displaced multiple times, are slowly stitching their lives together. They cannot let go of the past, and the present holds them in its vice-like grip.A UN panel of experts report published in 2011 estimates some 40,000 civilian deaths in the final phase of the war. The report attributed most civilian casualties to government shelling, a charge that Colombo has flatly denied. The impact was most intensely felt in Mullivaikkal village here, where thousands of displaced people took refuge. That is where Kamala lost her mother and her young husband.It is more than seven years since the Sri Lankan armed forces defeated the rebel Tigers, ending the brutal war. In October last year, the UN Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a resolution moved by the United States, and co-sponsored, among others, by Sri Lanka, that seeks to probe allegations of human rights violations during the war. Even as different actors argue for and against international judges participating in the process, survivors in the countrys war-ravaged Northern Province continue battling its lingering aftermath every day of their lives.Gruelling schedulesAfter my first husband died, soldiers would just walk into my house and speak very inappropriately. They would harass me day after day. The local men were even worse. They would just hound any woman living alone. I knew I could not survive by myself, that too with a child. I got married again, says Kamala.Her days now begin at four in the morning. She takes an hour to cook and pack rice meals. She makes four packets, two each for her husband and herself to take to work. We have rice for breakfast and lunch, there is no time to make anything else. When she returns home in the evening, it is time to prepare dinner. After her father died in 1996, it was Kamalas mother who toiled as a labourer to support her and her siblings. I didnt realise her role when she was alive, but today I miss her the most. Had she been around, she would have taken care of my children while I am away at work, she says, fixing her glance at Mukesh, who is still playing with the cycle pedal.Kamala does not seem to mind her gruelling schedule. At least it takes her mind off the past. Right from her school days, distress followed her like a shadow. The LTTE demanded one child from every home to join their cause. They took me. I could not stand their horrible practices and somehow managed to escape, risking my life. She dropped out of school in Class VIII.Even as she despises the LTTE for taking her by force, she thinks the organisation helped maintain some order in the town. The rampant alcoholism we see today would have been impossible had the Tigers been around. Things were not so costly. Life was better in a sense.With her husband too engaged in daily wage labour, the couple gets by with some support from an elderly neighbour who takes care of Mukesh during the day. Her elder son, who is seven, lives with an aunt in Kilinochchi, about 50 km away. Kamala has not spoken to her aunt in weeks. If I do my son cries a lot, asking me when I will bring him here.She plans to, in January. But by then she would have to think of ways of sending him to school. Whether it is transport or tuitions, everything costs money. A tiny home built with financial aid, an uncertain job and a meagre income from it is all she has.Catch-22 on the coastOn the other side of Mullaitivu, closer to the coast, are families whose lives are tied to the sea. Fishing is a key driver of the districts economy, along with agriculture.A small group of women gather at the front verandah of one of the homes. They are attired in gowns that flow below the knee, some in bold colours sporting floral prints. It is past noon and very warm, the sporadic sea breeze alone bringing some relief. They used to call this place a prawn bank, says Edel Queen, who formerly headed a womens organisation here. The catch has fallen in the last few years, largely due to Indian trawlers fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters. More recently, Mullaitivu fisherfolk are being forced to compete with fishermen from the southern districts of the island who have begun fishing in the northern seas. The drop in fish production has left many men and women jobless. Edel recalls a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making small sums of money on a regular basis. Now that has become impossible, she says.Many of them burnt their fingers borrowing money to set up small businesses. Leasing companies have mushroomed in the north, says Edel. Trying to replay old loans, many find themselves trapped deeper in debt. According to government data in 2012-13, Mullaitivu has the highest percentage of poor households in the country at 24.7 per cent. The mean household income here, as per census data for 2012-13, is Rs.23,687 (approximately INR10,700), the lowest among Tamil-majority districts, and in the country.With few options, most of the women now take up odd jobs for a small daily wage. They make and sell fruit juices in the village or package grocery items in small quantities.A few others, mostly younger women, have joined a garment factory in Puthukkudiyiruppu, travelling 20 km one way. This is one of the three factories that were set up in the north following the war.Employing many thousands of women, mostly in their twenties, the factories draw cheap labour. The women stand all day and work, making branded garments that fetch them a few hundred rupees every day. With no crche or child care facility, the factory automatically excludes young mothers.Broken familiesAccording to the District Secretariat records, Mullaitivu has nearly 6,000 women who are the sole breadwinners in their families. At least 5,000 women are widows, with many of them losing their husbands during the war.In addition to the many thousand lives that the indiscriminate shelling claimed during the conflicts last days, over 750 people in the district are reportedly missing. Some since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated the district. And others during the war, due to enforced disappearances.My neighbours saw the army personnel arrest and take away my husband. I dont know where he is, I am still searching for him, says Nirmala (name changed), a woman in her early thirties. She has checked in rehabilitation camps, prisons and hospitals in vain. Some say he might have died, I dont know. What if he is alive? He must be alive, somewhere far away.Between appearing before commissions that hold public hearings and running to government offices with petitions, she takes up any daily wage job that comes her way to support her two young children.Amid growing pressure from families of missing persons, the government in Colombo recently decided to set up an Office of Missing Persons by an Act of parliament. It is a welcome move, but it should be set up in Vanni, says Nirmala, referring to the mainland area of the Northern Province. We cannot keep running to Colombo every time, right? How will young mothers go all the way, forgoing a days income and spending on the journey? Who will take care of their children?A missing person, in many families, also translates into having one less earning member. Aged parents and young spouses run from pillar to post, seeking answers or, possibly, some closure.Almost every family has lost a relative to the war, or is looking for a missing member. Many homes have a photograph of a relative hanging in the living room, with an oil lamp lit beside. Grief over the past coexists with anxiety about the future.Men are engaged in daily wage jobs, if not in farming or fisheries. However, given the number of single women running homes, there is a desperate need for sustainable jobs and child care facilities, the women emphasise.We need industries. That too industries linked to our natural resources  the sea, agriculture or forests, says Edel. They teach us to sew or make sugar candies or pappadam [a lentil-based flatbread]. How long can we do that? Where is the market? How do we compete? she asks, having tried it all  from skills training workshops held by government and non-governmental organisations to entrepreneurship.Vanni parliamentarian Shanthi Sriskantharajah agrees. The reason that women have not got into palmyra products is because there is no market. We need industries focussing on natural resources of the region. And we need to find a way of marketing the products.This is something that neither the central government in Colombo nor the Northern Provincial Council elected by the Tamils seems to act upon. They keep organising some programme or the other for women. They buy them milo packets and make presentations. Thats about all. Nothing changes, Shanthi notes.Accessing natural resources comes with a set of challenges. If fisherfolk are faced with a diminished catch, many farmers are fighting for their land that is still under military occupation.After President Maithripala Sirisena came to power in January 2015, defeating former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, he began releasing private land that the armed forces had occupied during the war. In Mullaitivu, the government has released almost 1,000 of the 2,000 acres taken over by the army, according to the District Secretariat.Reclaiming land after 30 years of displacement involves major adjustments for the displaced families. Those who were children back then would have grown up now and have families of their own, explains Sundarampillai Sivamani, a 60-year-old farmer. Sivam akka, as she is known in her village, grows paddy and groundnuts on a small farm her family has taken on lease. The five acres she owns have been occupied by the forest guard for years.That is what happens when you get displaced for so long, she tells me, sitting at a bus shelter. Families lost members. They lost birth certificates, national ID cards, land deeds. The missing documents haunt them as they try to trace and reclaim their own land. But I realise how lucky I was, I did not lose any of my children. Especially since she witnessed her 14-year-old nephew succumb to a bomb that landed near their bunker. He had a bath, and had oiled and combed his hair so neatly. He looked like a prince that day.She remembers his last words, Athai (aunt), I am feeling very scared today, he told her. Dont worry, we are in a bunker and will be safe here, she assured him. The army had said they were all safe there. He probably believed her. He smiled. Within minutes, however, she heard his mother scream. A shell had pierced through his head and he dropped dead. His smile was intact, says Sivamani, her bold voice suddenly shivering. No one had time even to bury the bodies there or grieve, they had to run for their lives.Battling everyday challengesIn Mullivaikkal or Nandikadal, the lagoon where LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is said to have been killed by the army, the residents are under watch, though many observe that surveillance has lessened since President Sirisena came to power.Is it okay to be named, they ask each other as they give interviews. It should be fine, we arent saying anything that is untrue, one of them reassures. We cant take a chance, you never know with the military, warns another. They negotiate this everyday fear, systematically evoked by the government and the armed forces in the islands post-war years.They try out different ways. Some Tamil women have joined hands with Muslim women who have recently returned to Mullaitivu, years after the LTTE forcefully evicted them. We have to reflect on the past together. Or we cannot move forward, says a prominent member of the group, requesting anonymity. Our Tamil leaders do not look beyond Jaffna. They do not know how we live in Mullaitivu, she says with anger. This feeling of being left out in the margins is not uncommon in the district. Leaders in Colombo will not let us come up in life. Their actions keep reminding us that we are Tamils, that we are second-grade citizens. They feel abandoned. There are some changes, we must acknowledge, intervenes another member of the womens group. They do not agree with each other. But they dont mind listening.However, most of them have little time to dwell on anger or resentment. The stark reality of negotiating each day presents a challenge. A kilo of rice costs 68 rupees (roughly INR31) in Mullaitivu. Sugar costs Rs.100. Coconut, 30 to 40 rupees. And sea fish, Rs.500 per kg. This is our situation today, says S. Mary, also employed in a groundnut farm like Kamala.Her family, like several others in Mullaitivu, migrated from the islands hill country, where Tamils of recent Indian origin live and make a living at the countrys famed tea estates. We left during the 1983 riots in the south. Only to face an even worse war in the north. I want to go back to the hills now, she says.Kamala hopes she gets called for work the next morning.There was a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making smallsums of money. Now that has become impossible.-Edel Queen, resident"

Suresh Chaudhury, Riya's father, told TOI that Balyan had created a reign of terror in Bhaurkala area in Muzaffarnagar.He recalled that Rohtash and his gang members had a land dispute with his cousin Chandrapal. Though Chandrapal was a police constable, the criminals used to threaten him with dire consequences. ""They used to arrive at his house and threaten him frequently. Fearing for his security, Chandrapal used to live at some other places,"" Chaudhury said.Once in a while, Chandrapal used to visit his house and shared the problems with him. On the fateful day on March 10, 2014, Chaudhury was sitting with Chandrapal at his house.""Suddenly Rohtash came with three persons. They had gun in their hands. Rohtash pointed a gun at Chandrapal. I intervened to save him,"" he said.The criminals started abusing Chaudhury and thrashed him. ""Rohtash then pointed the gun at me. He said that I was giving him shelter,"" he said.Chaudhury's wife Anita was in the kitchen while daughter Riya was studying. Riya was appearing for Class XII examinations that week. She had already appeared for two papers. ""My daughter and wife came out and they too intervened. Rohtash opened fire at me. My daughter immediately came in front of me and she received the bullet on her chest. She was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared her dead,"" he said.Chaudhury's wife Anita was also shot on her left hand. She later recovered in the hospital.The Union government honoured Riya with National Bravery Award on January 26, 2015. The UP government also awarded her with Rani Laxmi Bai Veerta Puraskaar in March 2015.Chaudhury said that Rohtash had been pressuring him and Chandrapal to settle the case. The state government had given two security personnel to Suresh Chaudhury. ""We need to visit the court frequently for hearing. We are happy that the accused is now behind bars,"" Chaudhury, who works in a sugar mill, said.Anita said that even a few months ago Rohtash threatened that it would be good for the family to reach a compromise. ""Even Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had security. Do not rely too much on security,"" the accused had told the family. The family feels that though the main accused is behind bars, some gang members are still at large.Anita said that she is a proud mother of a brave child. ""I am a proud mother. Riya wanted to become an engineer when she was alive,"" she said."
58f644a7a3d24b0b70c29b80,A silence that’s deafening,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-silence-that%E2%80%99s-deafening/article15006571.ece,2016-09-30,"If any political leader or pundit were to have said, even just four months ago, that lakhs and lakhs of Marathas were going to mobilise and march across Maharashtra, week after week, from Parbhani in Marathwada to the so-called intellectual and knowledge capital Pune, nobody would have believed that prognosis. Nobody, not even the powerful Maratha leadership, including the strongman of Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar, had seen the turbulence beneath the superficial and deceptive calm in the community. Now it is obvious that the frustration and anger among the Marathas has been brewing intensely.Most people outside Maharashtra do not understand the difference between the two phonetically similar sounding terms, Maratha and Marathi. Why, even the metropolitan Mumbaikar cannot comprehend the distinction. The broadcast media and panel pontiffs too are confused by the sudden tsunami-like Maratha marches, which they cannot simply ignore because of their sheer size and breadth. Indeed, the mobilisation is so grippingly picturesque that television cameramen and anchors cannot underplay it by pretending that Kashmir and the Cauvery water crisis are far more important!The class divide among MarathasThe Maratha caste can be broadly compared with Jats in Rajasthan and Haryana or Patidar-Patels in Gujarat, primarily farmers. They are one-third of the States population and Marathi is their mother tongue, though not exclusive to them. Within the community, there is a hierarchy observed very diligently, particularly when it comes to matrimony. However, irrespective of social hierarchy, they are all directly connected with agriculture, sons of soil, as it were. But there is another hierarchy, that of class. There are four class divisions.The elite Marathas are directly related to power or power centres  ministers, chairmen of commissions, various boards, directors in cooperative banks, board members of sugar cooperatives, zilla parishad or gram panchayat chiefs, and so on. These Marathas are seen to not distinguish between the private and public.The class just below them is the rich farmer, bagayati or cash crop farmer. They are powerful because they command respect on account of their wealth, which also gives them status and authority in the villages. They are not in political power directly, but they have political heft across parties as they finance candidates.Next in the hierarchy comes the small or middle peasant, who survives on a season-to-season basis, is dependent on the vagaries of nature, is anxious about the monsoon, takes small loans to run the farm or for wedding expenses, and commits suicide if harassed by the bank or moneylender. The middle peasant aspires to be a rich farmer, and hence imitates the lifestyle of the well-off farmer. When he fails to live up to his projected image, distraught, he hangs himself.The lowest and the last layer is that of the landless peasants and agricultural labourers who depend on government employment guarantee schemes and other benefits.The only bond among this four-layered class structure is of caste. Being Maratha gives them a feeling of difference from the other and an illusion of being important.The power elite have everything going for them. The rich farmers main worry is that he is not getting cheap labour because of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. His economic interest pits him against his Maratha brethren because of the class distinctions. The real frustration is among the small/middle farmers, the vast section of landless farmers and/or agricultural labourers. A young person among the lower classes of Marathas has had no opportunities for higher education, no possibilities of migrating to the cities for a better future, and certainly no avenues to new kinds of jobs  in the information technology sector, for instance. Unemployment, declining agriculture, compounded by severe drought and devastating floods, have threatened his very survival.For the past two years these suffering classes waited with great expectation for  Achche Din . They had voted against the Congress because their condition saw no improvement during the years of Congress rule. They thought Narendra Modi would provide what the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) alliance did not. Now, theres disillusionment.Searching for an object of ireThus, multiple frustrations got accumulated and mixed up. But who should be held responsible? The Marathas are in power from sugar cooperatives to Mantralaya, the administrative headquarters of the State government. All parties, from the Congress, NCP, to the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena have large contingents of Marathas. In assemblies and local self-governments there is Maratha domination. And yet the lower- and middle-rung Marathas feel isolated, neglected, marginalised in the job market and denied opportunities in higher education.The reservation policy gave Dalits an advantage vis--vis Marathas in getting admission in reputed colleges. Ironically, many of the States private colleges and deemed universities are owned, run and managed by the Maratha power elite! Moreover, the subcaste, or parallel caste, Kunbi, was included in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation category. That, too, has fuelled the demand for reservation among other larger Maratha groupings. The disgruntled Maratha youth, instead of wagging an accusing finger at the power elite of their own caste, began to see an enemy in the Dalit community, the beneficiaries of the reservation policy.The brutal rape and murder of a Maratha girl in July by a few Dalit youth in Kopardi village of Ahmednagar district provided these marginalised Maratha youth an opportunity to direct their wrath against the Backward Castes and OBCs. Though none of the recent Maratha marches have witnessed any diatribe against the Dalit community, the underlying message is that the mobilisation is targeted against the Dalits. Since the NCP founded and led by Mr. Pawar has the largest Maratha following, many commentators believe that he and his party are behind the movement. The Maratha elites are happy to face this charge, because they get credit for channelling the discontent when they are at best only supporting from behind the scenes what is essentially a spontaneous expression of mass (and class) frustration.In the past it was the Brahmin (caste and class) that was the enemy of the Marathas (self-declared Bahujan). The Dalits and OBCs too regarded Brahminism as the main enemy. Demographically, this upper caste had just about 4 per cent presence in society but dominated education, bureaucracy, media and other institutions of power. That domination was sharply reduced following reservation, and a section of the Marathas too entered the corridors of power and influence. But still there were the vast armies of lower- and middle-end Maratha youths deprived of participation in the mainstream economic, political and cultural affairs. Around 200 Maratha families have kept the reins of power in their hands, claim organisers of the protest movement.Rage of the have-notsAs stated in the beginning, the marches are a reflection of the massive crisis in the agricultural economy of Maharashtra. That is the reason the demand for the implementation of reports of the M.S. Swaminathan-led National Commission on Farmers between 2004 and 2006 has acquired importance in this agitation. The farmer is denied competitive prices for his produce, affordable prices for the input elements, relief and support during drought, famines and floods, and help from financial institutions when it is the need of the hour.This hapless and helpless small and middle farmer is seeing around him the new wealth, new opportunities, new jobs, new lifestyles that he too aspires to. The urban haves and rural haves have cornered the new wealth, making him the new poor. The new poverty is not poverty imposed on him by nature or overall backwardness; it is enforced by the ruling class and the ruling government and the ruling establishment. He knows who the enemy is: it is in his neighbourhood and his community. That is why all the marches are silent protest processions, perhaps. The marches are disciplined, clean, huge and silent, with massive participation from women of all age groups and girl students who are angry because they feel the future is being snatched away from them.The silence of the lakhs of marchers is deafening and the elite  Maratha or Brahmin or Dalit  are feeling threatened. It is a silent political bomb ticking and could explode anytime, devastating all that we think is stable and settled.Kumar Ketkar is a veteran journalist and Chief Editor of Dainik Divya Marathi.The disgruntled Maratha youth, instead of wagging an accusing finger at the power elite of their own caste, began to see an enemy in the Dalit community"

It's my biggest step. I have a different plan and a more serious plan. Right now it's my biggest fight.""California-based Golovkin is the biggest overseas boxer to fight in the United Kingdom since Russian-Australian Kostya Tszyu lost to Ricky Hatton in 2005.Earlier this week, his presence at a public workout brought London's busy Covent Garden to even more of a standstill than usual.That is because Golovkin, known as 'Triple G', arrived in London with a reputation of producing exciting knockouts in an unbeaten career that has seen him stop 32 of his 35 opponents.It has made him the most feared fighter in the world and none of his world title fights since 2010 have gone the distance.Rival champions such as Mexican Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez have declined the chance to fight the world middleweight number one.The Kazakh's promoter, Tom Loeffler, believes Golovkin's appeal is also down to his personality and friendly image outside the ring.- 'Bigger than Turpin' -""It's the Mike Tyson effect. Fans just want to see him,"" Loeffler told AFP.""A lot of great boxers aren't that likeable, but Gennady is exciting inside the ring and he's likeable outside the ring.""A big part of it, even if he doesn't speak perfect English, is his personality and respect for opponents and the sport. It's why people generally like to cheer for him.""The odds and statistics are stacked against Brook, who is unaccustomed to the role of underdog after stopping 25 of his 36 opponents and completing three low-risk defences of his IBF belt.Brook, 30, believes beating Golovkin would surpass any achievement by a British boxer, including Randy Turpin's 1951 points win over the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the world middleweight title.""I don't think anyone in Britain has done what I'm going to do,"" Brook told AFP.""I don't think it has been done before. Randy Turpin is the only one, but because I'm going up from welterweight to fight the most feared fighter on the planet, it's even bigger than that.""It's debatable, but that's my opinion. Whatever Naz (Naseem Hamed) has done or any other British fighter recently, like Ricky Hatton, Joe Calzaghe, Lennox Lewis, it will blow it out the water.""It would put me with all those greats and I would be top of the pile.""Brook says he feels more comfortable as a middleweight than a welterweight and also insists he is not intimidated by Golovkin's fearsome reputation.""I just know what I can do and anyone can be beat,"" Brook told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.""He's got to opponents before he has fought him, like a young Mike Tyson's opponents were beaten before they got in the ring with him.""My mindset and determination are different from everyone else's and that's why I'm going to win this fight.""str/thw"

The delay in commencement of production at MPM has created apprehensions among the sugarcane growers, he said.Though there is a great demand for sugarcane from the local jaggery units, farmers are eager to supply their produce to MPM as the firm has maintained transparency with regard to weighing and payment.The legal problems regarding the resumption of production at MPM have been cleared.The State government should immediately provide necessary financial assistance for the management of MPM to resume production, he said.The protesters also blocked road for some time at the Dr. B.R.

Bakers themselves appear divided on the issue with many suggesting that a Rs 2 jump in the prices would drive consumers away and indications to that effect can already be seen. Several locals have turned to bhakris , rotis and chappatis and the All Goa Bakers' Association accepts that increasing the price to Rs 5 has dampened demand for what was considered staple diet in Goa.Pre-empting the All Goa Bakers' Association's meeting of all bakers on July 23, poders in Aldona, Calangute, Siolim, Curchorem, Candolim, Porvorim, Utorda and other places have gone ahead and started charging Rs 5 per bread for the 50g bread.""Who can afford to pay Rs 20 for four bread? It is better to make bhakri ,"" Luiza Marie Pereira said.Pleading helplessness, bakers have pointed out that the increase in commodity prices and the government's failure to roll out the proposed subsidy for bakers and traditional poders has forced them to increase the price of the pao.""When we last raised the prices, flour cost Rs 1,745 for a 90kg bag. Now the prices have reached Rs 2,700 for the same bag. Sugar has gone up. Yeast prices have increased from Rs 80 to Rs 100. Firewood is expensive,"" All Goa Bakers' Association president Agapito Menezes points out.While the All Goa Bakers' Association has yet to arrive at a decision, the All Goa Bakers and Confectioners Association and the All Goa Bakers Bread Union in Calangute has already implemented the Rs 2 hike in prices for bread.The increase in prices has made many families think twice about the quantity of bread bought on a daily basis. Quite a few locals have also taken a decision to purchase bread for special occasions. pao has been a part of Goan culture and no special occasion is complete without bread, be it a wedding or a feast.""We used to get seven bread for Rs 20. To spend more than Rs 20 is too much and we make sure that people will eat bread before buying,"" Mohandas Malkarnekar said.With Goans slowly shying away from their favourite bread, the impact will be felt by the small bakers who only depend on bread to sustain their operations. Larger bakeries that offer cakes, buns, confectionery items and snacks will continue to remain afloat, Menezes said.Detractors of the price hike include bakers such as Cajetan Fernandes from Orlim who agrees that while the jump to Rs 5 was justified, it would pinch customers and a gradual move to Rs 4 per bread and later Rs 5 would be sensible.""People will stop buying the pao and will buy slice bread instead. The small poders will struggle and quit. If they decide to jump to Rs 5 then they must be ready to suffer the consequences,"" Menezes says with an air of resigned finality."

Skimming through my inbox, I find a press release on how Sri Krishna Sweets  famous for inventing the rich, creamy mysurpa version of the traditional Mysore pak  was celebrating its founder N.K. Mahadeva Iyers 92nd birth anniversary this week. Since the founder also created the sweet, for just one day the chain gave customers one kilo of this now-iconic sweet free for every kilo that was bought.A day before the big giveaway, I mail the company to ask if I can pop by, meet the owner and see the process. After some polite hemming and hawing, Im asked to report at the Ashok Nagar outlet in Chennai. En route, I bone up on mysurpa trivia. This soft, unctuous version of the sweet is surprisingly controversial, dividing Mysore pak fans into two camps. There are those who still swear by the brittle, honeycomb version, jagged with flavour and crunchy with sugar. And then there are the converts, addicted to this version, which the founder renamed mysurpa for its (as their press release puts it) world famous melting magic.I meet Mahadeva Murali, the MD, and son of the founder, at the restaurant. Hes smoothening the surface of a tray of freshly-made mysurpa. Courteous, deferential and soft-spoken, he has a surprisingly gentle vibe for a person who runs 39 restaurants and outlets across Chennai and Puducherry. The Sri Krishna empire expands even further; his brother oversees another 54 outlets across the country.To my surprise, Murali enters the kitchen, quietly takes off his shoes, picks up a long-handled spatula and begins to stir an oversized, well-weathered iron kadaai , as a chef fills it with sugar and a generous splash of water. The consistency of the syrup must be just right, he says, as he tilts the spoon to demonstrate how the frothy mixture is getting thicker and stickier.His chef takes over, adding freshly-ground gram flour (besan) to the syrup, and then stirring with a practised rhythm, roasting the mixture till it becomes glossy and the room is filled with its delicious caramel-like scent.I take deep, appreciative breaths as they pour in warm liquid ghee. This is the first time I [have ever allowed] an outsider to see this in 20 years, says Murali. His team  gathered around to watch  nods wide-eyed. As it turns out, most of them havent seen it either. We make it only in our central kitchen in Thiruvallur.Im suitably awed. So, its a secret recipe? I ask. He chuckles. Its sugar, gram flour and ghee. Our secret is the technique. The way it is stirred... He adds thoughtfully, Dont tell anyone about that.I couldnt even if I wanted to. The rhythm with which the sweet is stirred as it steadily thickens into a luxurious lushness is unexpectedly complex. The mixture bubbles energetically at first. As it gets denser, there are big, audible, liquidy glugs. Then, it begins to splatter. We step back hurriedly, but Im not quick enough. A searing blob lands on my wrist. Quickly ascertaining that no one is looking, I put it in my mouth. Its delicious.The scrape of the spatula against the kadaai is slowing down now, as the chef firmly coaxes more ghee into the mixture. I love that sound, says Murali. I recorded it and asked a musician friend to create a ringtone by adding guitars. He says he still grabs any opportunity to watch the process. Now, Im 56 years old. For more than 40 years, I have been watching it being made. You cant separate me and my mysurpa.As the sweet is poured into a tray, and smoothened on top, he talks about how his father invented it. Traditionally, Mysore pak is hard and porous. My father wanted to improve it. He tried a hundred versions, then found a way to get this soft texture. He put out a tray and it sold out immediately.This was in the early 70s. Today, they make one tonne a day at Muralis central kitchen, and five times that during festivals. The secret? Quality ingredients. Pure ghee: it gives a flavour that stays. Then theres the signature stirring. And love, says Murali, in all seriousness.Im eyeing the tray filled with still-molten mysurpa. Wait 20 minutes, says the chef. I dont mind it warm, I counter. No, no. The texture changes. You must eat it only when it sets, says Murali. A staffer jumps up and volunteers to hold the tray aloft, right under an air-conditioner. Everyone around him fans it, and him, simultaneously. Then, finally, they cut me a still warm, slightly wobbly slice. And as predicted, its heavenly."
58f647eea3d24b0b70c29d8a,The bane of a bumper crop,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-bane-of-a-bumper-crop/article14985193.ece,2016-09-17,"Every day, around 3 p.m., hundreds of lorries loaded with onions queue up at the new agricultural market complex at Lasalgaon, around 45 km from Nashik, waiting for the afternoon auction to begin.As a group of traders approach, the farmers drop their produce at their feet, as if to tempt them into bidding high. The traders halt and look over the merchandise. A market committee employee calls out the reserve price: 400! Eyes roll, unspoken words seem to pass between the traders. Then the bidding starts: 1! 11! 13! 17! In less than 30 seconds, the auction is over. The farmer gets 17 rupees over the reserve price, Rs.417 per quintal (100 kg). A pittance at any given time, more so now when compared to prices last year.A trader-controlled marketNo matter how united the farmers are, no matter how hard they fight for a better price, they turn into mute spectators in front of the traders when auction begins. The auction is dictated by the traders with money and considerable political clout. Traders decide the price, farmers accept it without protest.The market complex has a huge parking space for the lorries. Sometimes there are up to 1,000 vehicles at a time. The otherwise deserted place comes alive twice a day. The first auction of the day starts at around 10 a.m. and the second at 3 p.m. Depending on the number of vehicles, the auction can stretch from an hour to three hours.Once the rate is fixed, the group of traders moves immediately to the next vehicle. The farmer, left with the price decided by the group, starts collecting the onions he has dropped on the ground. An official from the market committee approaches him with a receipt, bearing the auction rate, traders name and farmers name. With a receipt in hand and onions in the vehicle, the farmer then proceeds to the godown where the weighing process takes place. As per the rules laid down by the market committee, the farmer must get the payment before the end of the day, which is largely followed.After the produce is dropped off at a shed in the complex, the traders take control of it. Workers start segregating the onions according to the quality and the packaging begins. Vehicles are loaded with the produce to be sent off to cities or to different States. Traders then get into a huddle to firm up the retail price of the produce  adding their profits  with nary a concern for the farmer and the price demanded by him. The operation is bloodless and smooth.Barely breaking evenWhile onion is one of the major crops in this belt, farmers also cultivate grapes, soya bean, sugarcane, and ginger. Speaking out against the cartel of traders is not easy when the farmer is dependent largely on the onion crop, as it may result in traders ganging against him (or her) by dropping rates for his produce.Official data from the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) says that this years prices  between Rs.500-Rs.800/ql., down from Rs.970-Rs.3,786/ql.  are the lowest in the last five years. This year, Rs.1,020/ql. (in June) was the highest rate given to farmers, compared to Rs.6,326/ql. in 2015-16, and Rs.2,626 in 2014-15.Growing onions costs between Rs.50,000 and Rs.80,000 per acre, and a cultivated acre yields not more than 100 ql. With this years average selling price at Rs.728/ql., an acres worth of onions would get the farmer around Rs.72,800. This sees some farmers barely break even; many lose money.Small wonder that Milind Darade, who owns 13 acres of land, is furious. This is the only industry where producers have no right to decide the price of their product, the onion farmer from Karanjgaon, Nashik district, says. Isnt it cruel? Shouldnt we get angry? The week before The Hindu caught up with him at the Saikheda sub-market committee, Darade was given a humiliating price for his produce: Rs.5/ql., or 5 paisa/kg. If that was not bad enough, Maharashtras Minister for Co-operation, Subhash Deshmukh, said on a live television show that his onions were rotten. Let me give you some information, he says indignantly, this is the onion you eat at a restaurant. Just peel off two layers and you would wonder whether it was really rotten.Darade has preserved the official paper from the market committee with the offered rate; he has laminated it to ensure it doesnt get dog-eared. He says that he was so angry that he refused to sell his onions and brought the load, some 10-11 ql., back to his farm to use as fertiliser. But, he says, When I calmed down, it dawned upon me that I must use it to highlight the plight of onion farmers.Supply-demand mismatchSimplistically put, there was a shortage last year, and this year has seen record onion cultivation. Abundant supply has brought the prices down. The farmers, though, are used to this kind of fluctuation. They dont blame the bumper crop and supply-demand equation; they say its the traders who are conspiring against them and the government has done little  or the wrong things  to help.To understand the current crisis for farmers, we need to step back a little.India has three onion crops a year. Early kharif (the crop sowed in the monsoon) onions come to market between October and December. Onions from the rangda, or late kharif, crop arrive from January to March. The winter or rabi crop is up for sale from April to May. Usually, some parts of the rabi crop are stored for a few months to fill the gap from May to October. Traditionally, prices rise from July to October; official data show that wholesale rates rise by as much as Rs.1,000/ql., even Rs. 1,500, later reflected in the retail market with an increase of Rs.5-Rs.10/kg for consumers.In 2014-15, the onions took a hit following a hailstorm in North Maharashtra which, in turn, affected their storage value. With many rotting, the onions that did make it to market commanded high prices.Then the drought of the summer just past played a role too; many sugarcane farmers switched to the less thirsty onion this year. The onion cultivation area in the State has almost doubled in year 2015-16, says Nanasaheb Patil, Director, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED). Farmers hoped that they will get last years rate  close to Rs.3,000-Rs.4,000/ql.  which did not happen, as production increased in huge proportions.India is the worlds second-largest onion producer (after China) with 26.79 per cent of the planets land under onion cultivation and 19.90 per cent of its production. Maharashtra is Indias largest producer, with a 32.45 per cent share of total onion production, and in turn, Nashik district in north Maharashtra accounts for with 41 per cent of the States onion harvest. According to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS), India produced 203.33 lakh metric tonnes (MT, 1,000 kg) of onions in 2015-16, up from 189.28 lakh MT in 2014-15. Lasalgaon, Asias biggest onion market, received around 32,680 MT in the previous fiscal year. Five months into this year, it has received 10,874 MT.To make matters worse for Maharashtras farmers, other States  notably Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka  have reported higher onion yields.Holding on for a better dayAside from the production glut, another important factor was a 40-day strike by traders in July and August, opposing the State governments decision to free agricultural market committees from government regulations. With no outlet for their rabi onions, farmers had no option but to store them and wait for the strike to end. In addition, thanks to the low prices, some farmers are choosing to not bring their onions to the markets, and instead are storing them away hoping an artificial scarcity later in the year will pay off for them.This strategy, however, comes with its own dangers: that of the crop rotting or the onions sprouting. Malti Bodke of Bhuse village points to her rotten onions with disgust. How long can we store them? Its been almost four months. Once the onions start sprouting, they lose weight, and it becomes difficult to get a higher price.The farmers also say that the traders are colluding to cheat them. Its a cartel of traders which decides the rates and once the market reopened, they ensured prices didnt cross Rs.1,000/ql., says Rajaram Fafale, from Maralgoi village.The strike gets blame for the glut. But did trade actually stop? Officials and traders seem to want consumers to believe that, but farmers say it never really stopped. Darade says that opportunistic traders discreetly approached farmers and quoted lowest possible rates. Farmers, thinking it was better to sell, even at a low price, rather than keep them and let them rot, did sell.Three years ago, when the farmers were getting Rs.4,500-Rs.5,000/ql., retail onion prices reached Rs.90/kg., which resulted in protests from the then-opposition parties, as well as consumer organisations, in Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, accusing the United Progressive Alliance government of failing to protect consumers.The governments first step was to increase the Minimum Export Price (MEP) to $1,150/MT. This made it difficult for Indian exporters to compete in international markets; whatever stock was available was diverted to the domestic market, which brought prices down. By March 2014, when the late kharif crop got to market, prices had dropped to less than Rs.1,000/ql. in the wholesale market, and consumers got theirs at Rs.20-Rs.25/kg.This may have played out well for consumers, but has had other consequences for the industry. There is absolutely no consistency in our approach towards onion exports, says NAFEDs Patil. A look at MEPs between December 2010 and December 2015 bears him out: the figure has fluctuated wildly, dropping to $0 in May 2012, and with a high of $1,150 in November 2013. It only enrages our customers overseas, says Patil. They are left with absolutely no guarantee of quantity and price of onions exported from India. These customers have instead chosen Pakistan, China and Iran, and we have lost guaranteed markets.Patil says that the governments decision to placate enraged urban customers has lost it both its farmers support and its overseas markets. The onion, he says, is no longer an agricultural commodity, it has become a political symbol.An MSP for onions?Assuming the government has to balance the needs of consumers with those of producers, what else could it have done to ensure that farmers get some return on their labour?The National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) keeps track of potential harvests by collecting information on each district. This year, despite being aware of the possibility of a bumper crop, the government appears to have failed to take any measures to protect farmers. The NHRDFs estimates say the rabi onions should be selling at around Rs.818/ql., which is significantly higher than what farmers are managing to get. If the government chose to use its Price Stabilisation Fund, it could subsidise the crop, paying, say, Rs.500/ql.What the State government has announced this week by way of relief  Rs.100 per quintal, up to a maximum of 200 quintals, or a maximum of Rs.20,000  has, to put it mildly, failed to enthuse farmers. Every farmer The Hindu spoke to called the measure not just inadequate but practically a mockery of their plight.Fafale, who sold 10 ql. at Lasalgaon for Rs. 220/ql., or Rs 2.2/kg., greeted the news with scorn. Now I will get one rupee more. What a relief! he says sarcastically. We arent begging in front of the government. What we are asking is our right. How does this government conclude that this much of money is sufficient as financial aid? Who advises them? Have they bothered to check the ground reality?One of the major demands the farmers have is for the government to introduce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for onions, as it has for sugarcane. Why dont the officers understand that we are not independent and traders enjoy a free run here? says Darade. Unless an MSP is announced, we cannot be sure of a certain minimum profit. Why this neglect?Western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt, has seen, in recent times, sugarcane farmers agitating for an increased MSP. It became an electoral issue in 2014 when the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) suffered major defeats in the Assembly polls in the region considered a bastion for both.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS; its name means organisation for farmers self-respect), led by Raju Shetti, which was in the thick of the agitation, is now part of the State government and Shetti is an MP. While the SSS has stage limited protests in the States onion belt demanding an MSP, it has not been able to take the protests to a wider audience. With the Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena regime, as with the previous Congress-NCP rule, the MSP for onions issue is far from being solved.In the village of Bhuse, Ramdas Bodke, 65, is philosophical. I have seen many seasons and farming has never been easy. We know how to tackle nature. What do we do with man-made problems? We farmers feed the world, but now we wonder whether we will have food cooked at home. He lapses into silence for a minute, and then his tone turns bitter: Did the government discuss its proposal to hike MLA salaries for even a day? The government takes an instant decision to increase the salary of MLAs, but it takes a long time to decide about farmers. This is injustice. But there is no one to give justice to farmers.As for the urban consumers and their agitations, farmers mince no words when the topic comes up for discussion. Turning towards me, one of them asks, You get agitated when prices skyrocket, but have you ever wondered what happens when prices hit rock bottom? Why dont you come out on the streets demanding a fair price for us?I have no answers.Abundant supply has brought prices down. But farmers say traders are conspiring against them and the government has done little to help"

However, the dues are yet to be repaid.Thereafter, Satpalsing Oberay, owner of Bombay's Motors, had accepted to run the sugar factory on rental basis, but he too failed to do so. The sugar factory authorities approached the minister of co-operative to revive the factory, but the move could not practically work out.Now, the bank has now started the process of seizure of the factory. In the notice, the bank has asked the factory authorities to hand over the secured assets to the bank on August 29 at its office, failing which the bank will be compelled to take possession."

Most may have just heard this but Dr Ravindra Kolhe can vouch for it. Born in the temple town of Shegaon, he listened to sermons of saints who visited the place. ""They had a deep impact on my heart and mind,"" says the doctor who had his early education at a local school in Marathi medium.Suffering with a congenital heart ailment termed as primary pulmonary hypertension, Kolhe says frequent hospitalization and frail health made him a voracious reader. ""I got very good marks in Std X and wanted to become an engineer. But my teachers said I should go for medicine.""Kolhe moved to Wardha and enrolled at JB Science College. ""It was here that I came under the influence of Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave. Their ideologies had a deep impact on my mind.""Good marks in Std XII ensured a seat in Government Medical College, Nagpur. ""Here, too, I looked around for a library and found one at Ramkrishna Mission,"" he says. By this time Kolhe had realized that he had to work in rural area. ""I read John Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' and was impressed by it. I was also in the company of seers at the Ramkrishna Math and would discuss the purpose of life with them.""By the time he was in the final year, he had formed a group called Sangharsh with his batch mates and they worked in the Babulkheda slum behind the medical college. ""It was at this time that I read the book 'Where There is No Doctor' written by a Spanish revolutionary. The book cover had an image of four persons carrying a patient on a stretcher and there was a milestone on which it was written -- hospital 30 miles. That image remained imprinted in my mind and when I passed out I decided to hunt for a village from where a hospital was 30km away,"" says the doctor.Though he wanted to rush to rural areas, ""my seniors advised me that I should first learn to do deliveries single-handedly, diagnose pneumonia with stethoscope and should be able to treat diarrhoea"", he says. Two house jobs in Mumbai equipped him with these skills.""My professors Dr Dinoo Dalal and Dr Minoo Advani took me through an intensive course in mother and child care,"" he says. On October 30, 1984, when Dr. Kolhe was just 23 years old, he went searching for the ideal village and travelled through Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.""I finally identified Bairagad in Amravati district on Feb 9, 1985. My batchmate and I began working from a veranda of a house,"" he says. But realization that they can't handle surgical emergencies made them decide that they should complete post-graduation too.Kolhe enrolled in GMC for MD in preventive and social medicine in 1986. ""My professor Dr Motghare said that I should look for some more sustainable solutions and asked me to prepare a paper on tribal health. The data that I collected about the mother and child health of tribals at Dharni was dismal.""What he discovered during this compilation was malnutrition of children in Melghat. These findings reached out to the world as he was interviewed by BBC radio. ""Suddenly this issue of child mortality and malnutrition in Melghat got political attention as I identified 200 reasons for it.""But after completing his MD, Dr Kolhe's partner refused to return to the village. ""This made it imperative that I get married as alone I could not serve the community."" But the conditions that he laid out for his would-be wife were tough. ""I wanted to marry a woman who would run the house in 400 per month, walk up to 40km, would agree for a registered marriage and be prepared to beg for others.""Ironically, the woman he married was a far cry. ""I was running a homeopathy clinic and earning lots of money. I was fashion conscious and would travel across the city just to match my footwear with a sari,"" says Dr Smita, who was also an ABVP worker and a school mate of Nitin Gadkari. ""But these four conditions were acceptable to me as I would always think what is it in life that I want beyond what I have,"" she says.In 1988, she left behind her penchant for good clothes and a good life and moved with her husband to Bairagad. ""It was a trial marriage and would continue till she kept to these four conditions,"" says Kolhe.In the village, the couple got a new mud house built by the villagers. ""Drawing water from the well, getting the mud, cow dung and hay mixture right for the walls, cooking on firewood were things that I had never done in life,"" recalls Smita.Wearing a sari costing 10 purchased from ration shops, she began enjoying the scenic beauty of Melghat and got involved in the life of the villagers. ""I loved the beauty of the place and the simplicity of the tribals,"" she says.The couple has two sons and both studied at the local school. ""The elder one Rohit is an agriculturist and the younger, Ram is studying at the medical college in Akola. The elder one's wife is a farmer's daughter. She took time to adjust with our lifestyle but is now comfortable with it,"" Smita says and adds that luckily the sons agreed to follow their parent's lifestyle.Going beyond community service through medicine, the couple have also focused their attention to making the village economically strong. ""We took help of agriculture universities and began sowing potatoes, soya bean, cotton, sugar cane, jute, water melon, turmeric and summer moong. Amravati is known as the suicide district but there are no such events in Melghat,"" says the proud couple.""Child mortality came down to 40 per 1000 when we began working it was 200, mortality of preschool children is 100, previously it was 400. We have been able to make an operation theatre with the help of private aid and now there are 70 doctors in the region,"" said Kolhe.The couple also organizes a camp 'Tarunai' for youth which is about social orientation and community living. ""We did not set up any NGO. This village is our karambhoomi and we are happy with any progress that is made here."" There only grouse is the lack of electricity in the area. ""It stops us from doing much more,"" they say."
58f64a32a3d24b0b70c29ebe,Cauvery water flows into irrigation canals,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Cauvery-water-flows-into-irrigation-canals/article15421985.ece,2016-10-02,"The Public Works Department has started releasing water from the Cauvery into irrigation canals of the district from Thursday bowing to pressure from farmers organisations.Farmers staged an agitation here on Thursday in protest against delay in releasing water into irrigation canals, including Uyyakondan canal with an ayacut of about 32,000 acres. Though the release of water into Kattalai High Level Canal and South Bank Canal at Mayanur bed regulator on the Cauvery river came as a relief for farmers, a section of farmers representatives said they were keeping their fingers crossed on whether they would get adequate water to sustain the samba crop for its entire duration in view of the poor inflow into Mettur dam.While the SBC irrigates hundreds of acres of banana, sugar cane and betel vine, farmers will shortly take up paddy cultivation in areas served by the canal between Mayanur and Pettaivaithalai. From Pettaivaithalai, the canal, as Uyyakondan, serves areas up to Vazhavandankottai beyond Thuvakudi on the Tiruchi-Thanjavur border.Similarly, the KHLC serves areas between Mayanur and Thayanur on the Karur-Tiruchi border, being the source of irrigation for not only paddy, sugar cane and banana but also for large tracts of fields where vegetable cultivation and floriculture have been taken up in places such as Posampatti, Mettupatti and Ettarai in Tiruchi district.It is welcome that the PWD has woken up to the situation and started releasing water after our protest on Thursday, said Ayilai Siva.Suriyan, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam. He pointed out that it would take a few more days for the water to reach the tail-end areas of the canal, leading to delay in samba crop. Much will depend on the monsoon as the present water storage in Mettur dam would not be enough to sustain the crop, he said.The KHLC has an ayacut of over 20,000 acres. Farmers at a few places along the canal have started sowing, anticipating water release in the canal. But only those with backup and alternative sources such as borewells could go in for the samba paddy crop confidently, said Puliyur A. Nagarajan, president of the farmers wing of Tamil Maanila Congress. The water released in the canals will meet the immediate requirements of standing cash crops such as banana which have started withering for want of water, he said. It would also help improve the groundwater table. But many farmers were wary of taking up samba paddy cultivation as they were not sure whether they could get adequate supply for the crop, he added.400 cusecs neededThe farmers representatives have demanded that at least 400 cusecs should be released into the KHLC to meet the irrigation requirement. The PWD should ensure that at least 240 cusecs of water was released downstream of Nachalur regulator, said R. Subramanian, deputy secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association. He also urged the PWD authorities to check lift irrigation resorted to by some farmers by using diesel motor pumpsets along the canal. This, he said, affected the water flow to the tail-end areas."

According to police, Pakistan could be the source of the drug as it was procured by the accused from Jammu and Kashmir.Though there had been cases in which Keralites were arrested for sourcing hashish and brown sugar from Jammu and Kashmir, incidents of sourcing synthetic drugs like MDMA from the northern state have not been reported. According to police, Palluruthy native Riyas, who is currently in Dubai, was supervising the entire operations of the drug trafficking network in which the arrested youths had worked as carriers.It was on Tuesday that shadow wing of special branch arrested Mentron Varghese (23) of Gothuruth, Roopesh (32) of Edavanakkad and Sanoop (23) of Palluruthy with 24g of MDMA, commonly known as party drug ecstasy.

Sugar prices have been on an uptrend since hitting a three-year low of 23,000 per tonne last July. A global sugar deficit drove up prices in the international market as well. Sugar production is estimated to have declined 11% to 25.2 million tonnes in 2015-16 season.Ratings agency ICRA expects domestic sugar production to decline by about 8% to 23.2 million tonnes during the 2016-17 season. This is largely on account of lower cane availability in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to poor monsoon rainfall last year. Although the monsoons are better this year, the impact on the cane output would be seen only in the 2017-18 season as sugarcane is a long gestation crop.Domestic sugar prices are likely to remain firm in the next 3-4 quarters, given the tight domestic stock situation, analysts tracking the sector said.However, the extent of cane price increase, especially in SAP (state advised price) following states like Uttar Pradesh , is likely to have a significant bearing on the (profit) margins of sugar mills in these states, they said. While the government has imposed 20% export duty in June and also implemented stock holding limits in September, these measures haven't acted as a deterrent to the increasing trend in domestic sugar prices, said Sabyasachi Majumdar , senior vice president, ICRA. ""Sugar prices are expected to remain firm in the near term in spite of these measures, given the tight stock position. However, these measures may dampen prospects of a further significant price rise,"" he stated.""Domestic production falling short of domestic consumption is likely to continue in 2016-17, for the second straight year a shortage of around 2.6-2.8 million tonnes,"" ICRA estimated.While sugar production is expected to decline in 2016-17, an opening stock of 7.6 million tonnes is likely to result in an overall sugar availability of 30.5-31 million tonnes, which is expected to meet the domestic consumption of around 26 million tonnes.But the closing stocks are likely to be lower than the normal sugar stock level of around 6.4 million tonnes or the equivalent of domestic consumption of about three months. While mills in Maharashtra and Karnataka are likely to benefit from the rising sugar prices and the stagnant cane costs, cane pricing in UP, which is yet to be fixed for 2016-17, will be crucial for the sustainability of the profitability for Uttar Pradesh-based sugar mills, ICRA said. ""With the FRP (fair and remunerative price) of cane for 2016-17 fixed at the same level as of the previous year and sugar prices on the higher side, the profitability of sugar mills based in Maharashtra and Karnataka is likely to improve,"" Majumdar said.""However, the extent of increase in profitability could be moderated with the decline in cane availability in these regions,"" he said."

Gurjit alleged that despite a complaint by the woman, who is the wife of a subedar posted in Jammu and Kashmir, following tehsildar Gurminder Singh's alleged demand for sexual favours, an FIR was registered against her on July 14.In her complaint, the woman had attached phone recordings and CCTV footage in which the tehsildar could be seen coming to her home.

Sambhajiraje is now a nominated member of Rajya Sabha.Ghatage has reportedly agreed to join the BJP after the CM agreed to appoint him as divisional head of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA).A close associate of Ghatage said that district guardian minister Chandrakant Patil took the lead in bringing Ghatage into the BJP fold. ""Discussions in this regard were held during the CM's visit to the city a couple of months ago. Sambhajiraje also helped convince top BJP brass to induct Ghatage into the party.""Samarjit is the son of the late Vikramsinha Ghatage, who is credited with running Shahu factory successfully for many years.Ghatage's induction will help BJP to keep NCP leader and former minister Hasan Mushrif busy in Kagal. At present, Mushrif faces opposition from Shiv Sena's Sanjay Mandalik and Sanjay Ghatage , both prominent leaders from Kagal.The NCP's local leaders claim that the move will affect the party's prospectus in the zilla parishad elections. Kagal is considered school of politics as each leader has visible mass support and elections here are won not on party lines but on the basis of number of leaders on each side.The elections to ZP will be decisive with respect to the political clout of all these leaders.

Bengal, however, has refused to get into a fight by registering its claim under Banglar rasogolla as opposed to Odisha's 'Pahala rasogolla' or 'kheermohan'.At the end of Monday's examination, sitabhog and mihidana inched closer towards bagging the GI tag, but more technical details were sought on Banglar rasogolla even though the team was more than satisfied with the documentation of its history.The team, led by GI examiner Prashant Kumar and assistant registrar of trademarks Chinnaraja Naidu, expressed their satisfaction over the documentation and technical details of the production of sitabhog and mihidana. ""They will now put these out on public domain on their website for people to comment. After a reasonable period of time, which is a couple of months at the most, if no objection comes, the two sweets will be given the GI tag,"" said Reena Venkataraman, secretary of the state science and technology department.Though the team expressed satisfaction over the documentation done for Banglar rasogolla, the state will still have to submit details on the range of viscosity of the sugar syrup in which the roundels are kept, the range of its texture and sponginess, said officials of the patent office of the science and technology department.Members of the Mistanna Byabasayee Samity were invited to attend the examination process of the sweets and give their views if asked. Among those who attended were Dhiman Das, of the K C Das family, which has been included for the contribution of Nabin Chandra Das towards the invention of rasogolla. Food historian Haripada Bhowmick was also present. ""The experts appreciated how we traced the rasogolla right from Sri Chaitanya's times when it was called chana bora to golak, then golla and finally rosogolla in 1865,"" Bhowmick said.In an effort to prove that Bengal's rasogolla is different from Odisha's pahala rasogolla or kheermohan, the latter two specimens were also reportedly presented to the experts, though they refused to include this variety as part of Monday's investigation. ""The team has done a thorough examination of 'Banglar rasogolla' and will send us an examination report with details of where we need to pad up the information that we have provided. Once we do that, this product will also be put up in the public domain. If no objections come, 'Banglar rasogolla' will also get the GI tag,"" Venkataraman said.The team was satisfied with the tulaipanji and gobindobhog varieties of rice, and these will also be put up in the public domain. The Parliament had recently accepted these varieties as Bengal's original produces, and it will be easy for them to bag the tag."

Recounting the incident, he said on June 29, an SUV was following them. Subsequently, the militants intercepted them and asked them to raise their hands over their heads and threatened to shoot them if they failed to comply. Srinivas said they fired five to six rounds in the air as well following which he and his colleague were blindfolded and taken to an isolated place after travelling for nearly 400 km at a speed of 100 to 120 km.After reaching their spot, there the kidnappers, nearly about 25 men, first offered them bread and water, and later a cup of curd.""Bread and water is the food that was given to us. I never used to eat bread in my life, but here I was forced to have it. To control the sugar levels, I requested them to offer a spoon of sugar every day which they agreed. They also washed our clothes for two days,"" Srinivas said, adding that he lost nearly 6-7 kg during his time in captivity.Srinivas further added that he was allowed to speak to his company management twice and once to directly speak to them for settling the ransom demand made by the abductors. ""They kidnapped us only for money. Thankfully, my company offered the ransom, but I don't know the details. I was supposed to reach home on Saturday, but finally landed at Mumbai airport on Sunday morning and arrived at home at 2.45 pm,"" Srinivas said, adding that he was released on July 16 at 11 am.""As I was completely blindfolded during captivity, I spent nearly 40% of my time praying to all gods including Lord Sri Venkateswara Swamy of Tirupati.

This announcement was made by Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari during Global Tiger Day programme on Friday.The minister said that the pilot project of providing a bamboo canopy will help maintain environmental balance. ""Bamboo is a fast-growing plant and absorbs large quantity of carbon dioxide,"" said Gadkari. Highlighting another project to curb pollution, he said bamboo would be used to produce ethanol which could act as alternative fuel for running vehicles. ""Hopefully, bamboo's cost will come at par with sugar cane,"" the minister added.Apart from Gadkari, state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and principal secretary (forest) Vikas Kharge attended the programme organized by state forest department at Mankapur Sports Complex.Congratulating the forest department for its two crore trees plantation drive, Fadnavis said the focus would now be on meeting the target of planting 50 crore trees in the coming two years. ""Forest ministry, which was always low profile, is playing an active role. Iconic tigers like Maya and Jai have not only generated revenue for the government but also given employment to local communities. We must all pledge ourselves for tiger conservation,"" he said. Fadnavis added the severe drought that the state faced in last few years was due to environmental imbalance.Mungantiwar urged citizens' participation in Green Army project. He also informed about Tadoba festival to be held in Mumbai from November 11-13.The ministers released postal stamps depicting Tadoba tigers and also felicitated winners of Sant Tukaram 'Vangram', Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 'Vanshree' and Selfie with Tree awards.Earlier, they inaugurated administrative building of Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM).

The management has also defaulted to credit the amount debited from salaries of the workers towards Employees Provident Fund (EFP), LIC and settlement of dues to banks and cooperative societies, E. Sivanandham, secretary of Joint Action Committee of trade unions told The Hindu .In spite of repeated representations the Puducherry Government has not paid remuneration to the employees since July. Nearly Rs. 22 crore remains unpaid towards payment of EPF (August 2012 to June 2015), salary and other statutory liabilities on the part of the management, he said. A section of employees alleged that a three-member committed appointed by the government in 2012 to manage the affairs of the mill resulted in maladministration and irregularities. The mill is now struggling with a huge financial crunch and workers are severely affected due to non-payment of benefits by the mill management.S. Senthil Kumar, president of the Lingareddypalayam Sugarcane Farmers Association said that the crushing season which should have normally commenced in November had not yet started as farmers had also been left high and dry due to delay in payment of dues to them.The mill management is yet to make payment to the tune of Rs.15 crore to farmers who had supplied cane for the crushing season during 2013-14 and 2014-15. Many farmers are not able to avail themselves of fresh crop loans as the management has not paid interest to the banks concerned, he said. More than 18,000 farmers are now left in the lurch with the government dragging its feet in convening the tri-partite meeting to fix the State Advisory Price for the crushing season of 2015-16."

If sugar mills are allowed to produce ethanol, it will be possible to clear the entire arrear in a single year.""Such a step will also help ""increase the procurement price for canes,"" he said and added that the government should give permission for ethanol production immediately, in tune with the onset of the annual crushing season, which is set to begin soon.

And joining the brigade is a bunch of homemakers who are busy thinking up innovate dishes to serve for Onasadya . In place of the different varieties of payasam, these women have come up with cute little baked desserts. So how about some Onam flavoured cupcakes for the sadya this year?When little Arjun complained about having the same vegetarian dishes year after year for Onam, Vishu and all other special occasions, his mom Lakshmi Sridhar decided to surprise him with something new this Onam. For the sadya this year, she plans to add Arjun's favourite dish along with the usual ones - cupcakes. ""To give it an Onam effect, I thought of giving it a topping of butter cream and sugar designed like chips, flowers and even payasam. Since I will be making a few for him, I thought I may as well bake some for my entire family. I am sure this will be the best Onam surprise they are going to get. Who doesn't like a change?"" asks Lakshmi. The colourful little cupcakes have a heavenly aroma and are bound to tempt even someone on a diet to take a bite.It was while pondering on how to bring about a change to the routine Onasadya that Sulthana Fathima, a baker from Thrissur, struck upon the idea of trying out something with cupcakes. And it took her only just half an hour to come up with some eye-catching as well as yummy - flower-shaped cupcakes! ""My only intention was to try something quirky. But it has not only jazzed up my creative skills but also satiated my sweet tooth. I have topped the flower shaped cupcakes with buttercream and am planning to arrange them like a pookkalam as the centre piece on the dining table. After the sadya when it is time for desserts, I will tell my family to pick one form the table. I am sure they will be really excited!"" she says.Homemaker Nirmala J says her love of baking is what prompted her to whip up cupcakes for her family this Onam. ""Every year I surprise my family with new flavours of payasam but this year I have my little nephew too coming down. So I thought of making a few cupcakes as well, to add a twist to the dessert section. The elders too will be sportive enough to appreciate it, I'm sure,"" she adds.These innovative chefs also have options for those who feel that nothing can replace the pal payasam served after the sadya  payasam flavoured cupcakes! ""These 'Onam special' cupcakes can be called the true fusion desserts. I baked mawa cakes and decorated it with a swirl of butter cream frosting.The ingredients include khoya, maida, butter and eggs with a dash of milkmaid, crunchy toasted cashews and raisins. It is flavoured with a hint of cardamom and saffron. It is truly a payasam cupcake,"" she says.Calicut-based college student Amrutha R has gone a step ahead this Onam with banana and jackfruit flavoured cupcakes. ""My grandfather loves banana and jackfruit but cupcakes not so much. But these flavours will surely appeal to both young and old,"" she says.Say cakes and all those with high blood sugar might back off. But Amrutha has options for them too, which she devised for her diabetic grandparents. ""Though my grandma has a sweet tooth, she always skips payasam after Onasadya as she has blood sugar. I have baked some exclusive cupcakes for her using sugar substitutes and brown sugar. The buttercream icing isn't as sweet as payasam, and won't cause health issues,"" she adds.And the bakers guarantee that even the colours used in the buttercream to create different designs of the cupcake is healthy. ""All these colours used in the decorations are imported ones which won't harm even infants,"" says Lakshmi. ""While payasam servings result in piles of plastic cups, cupcakes just leave a piece of paper that is completely bio degradable,"" Sulthana adds.In terms of cooking time too, cupcakes suit new generation moms as they take much less time than payasam. ""Making payasam from scratch is a Herculean task but it just takes 15 minutes to bake ten cute cupcakes,"" says Anasuya Balan from Trivandrum. Moreover, her daughter Miya is a hardcore fan of buttercream. ""The cakes taste better on the second day of baking. So I decided to bake the cake on the previous day and prepare the sadya early in the morning. I am skipping payasam as it steals half of my cooking time.""Lakshmi too has a similar view. ""Preparing payasam on festive days takes up a lot of time, almost two hours. From aviyal to kalan, I have to make nearly ten dishes, and preparations will go on till lunch time. One should spend Onam day with family and refresh memories, I feel, than in the kitchen. Cupcakes have actually come to my rescue,"" she quips."

Sanjeev Babar, managing director of Maharashtra Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd, said, ""It is true that shortage of sugarcane in the coming crushing season is a major concern. We have discussed the issue with the officials, including state co-operation minister Subhash Deshmukh.""""Generally, the crushing activity picks up pace after the Diwali season. A good recovery rate of sugar is generally achieved between January and March. Hence, the mills are reluctant to start the season before Diwali. In the current year, Diwali will be at the end of October because of which the mills have demanded to start crushing season in November,"" he said.The state has a daily crushing capacity of 5.6 lakh tonnes of sugarcane, while the actual production is 550 lakh tonnes. It means that the entire sugarcane crushing season could last for 100-120 days as production in districts such as Kolhapur and Sangli is huge, while Ahmednagar, Pune and most of the Marathwada region have shown a sharp decline.Confirming the development, Deshmukh said, ""If we insist on starting the sugarcane crushing season, it would be inappropriate because the labour force will not turn up before Diwali. During the winter season, sugarcane is not completely mature which affects sugar recovery. With lower sugar recovery, the mills will face higher production cost.""In 2015-16, as many as 177 sugar mills had crushed 740 lakh tonnes of sugarcane. The average requirement of sugarcane for efficiently running all the mills is 940 lakh tonnes. Deficit rainfall in 2014 and 2015 followed by surplus sugar production and sluggish international market collectively affected the income of farmers from sugarcane cultivation. Every year, the Union government increases the fair and remunerative price formula which hikes the sugarcane purchase price. But due to low profit margins, most of the sugar mills have not paid the entire amount to farmers.The areas such as Solapur and Nashik as well as districts of Marathwada that receive scanty rainfall have reported reduction in sugarcane cultivation."

They will not be required to do so if they develop indigenous technologies, Mr. Gadkari told PTI.The automakers should encourage indigenous technologies under Make in India drive, the minister said while stressing that nation is battling with the problem of pollution and this could be their contribution to check it.Citing example of Brazil, he said, Flex fuel is available for all major brands, whether Volkswagen, Ford, Toyota, Honda or Hyundai. Flex engine is there. In the same tank you can use petrol and ethanol.Why cant the automobile manufacturers here get indigenous technologies? he wondered, asserting that such an initiative would not only reduce pollution but would help in diversification of agriculture.Agriculture economy is facing lots of problems...thousands of our farmers are committing suicide.

He called for a discrimination-free society predicated on truth, justice and equality.Mr Bhagwat evoked Mahatma Gandhis vision of Hind Swaraj in the same breath in which he said that the Sangh stood for equality.More than one-and-a-half lakh Sangh activists from across 5,000 villages in Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Kolhapur districts in Western Maharashtra began congregating in serpentine queues late Sunday afternoon at Marunji village, close to Hinjewadi IT park.Standing in disciplined columns in a 450-acre area, RSS activists unleashed a display of dynamic force in the event titled Shiv Shakti Sangam , which evoked Chhatrapati Shivajis unifying capabilities against invaders.The tone and tenor of the RSS chiefs address particularly emphasised religious unity and extolled an egalitarian Indian society.The bad deeds committed by strong nations are often overlooked, while the good deeds by weaker nations are often not accorded any value. A nations prestige increases only by its strength. This is the way of the world. But that strength must be tempered by justice, said the RSS chief, from a massive set resembling Shivajis Raigad Fort.Eco-friendly themeThe set was built by noted art director Nitin Desai. An eco-friendly theme was stressed throughout the conclave, which is the RSSs biggest effort in recent times to reach out to all sections of civil society. In this vein, he remarked upon the diversity of Indias culture and its religions as its true bedrock and stated that all religions in the country preached truth and non-violence.Humility has been an essential and peculiarly Indian quality, which has made its national character so attractive. We have shown the world that to be fearless, one needs physical strength coupled with humility, said Mr. Bhagwat, adding that invaders had been able to dominate India only owing to its internecine struggles.Moral beaconHe said that India can act as a cultural and moral beacon to the world, the RSS chief said that even if a society was materially impoverished, but disciplined and resolute, it could achieve the impossible.In this context, the RSS chief referenced the birth of Israel in 1948 following 2,000 years of continuous persecution endured by the Jewish people since they became a diaspora.According to political observers, the real agenda behind the RSSs gargantuan show of strength was a bid to break the stranglehold of the sugar barons of western Maharashtra and supplanting the influence held by the Congress and the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party over the region.Also present on the occasion were Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Sarkaryawah Suresh Joshi."

This, however, is a significant gain compared to 1-2% that was being achieved in early 2014. Almost all of the 120-odd crore litres of ethanol (for blending with petrol) is gotten from molasses, a waste product from the sugar industry.Hitting the 5% target only with molasses is quite possible, said Pramod Chaudhari , executive chairman of Pune-based Praj Industries , which is involved in research and development of various processes that converts various raw materials into ethanol.Chaudhari, however, said due to the vagaries of sugarcane crop the government has to look at other sources of bio-feeds if it has to realise the target of 10%.""To achieve 10% by 2022, availability of raw materials is required... With molasses, the existing production can be increased to up to 160 crore litres. For more, feed stock other than molasses is being looked into,"" Chaudhari, who is also the chairman of the bio-energy committee of industry body CII , said.Given the dispersed nature of agriculture in the country, the collection and distribution of agri-waste is a big challenge. About 80% of Indian farmers are small and marginal farmers holding less than two hectares of land.""Collection, aggregation and distribution is a big challenge,"" said Chaudhari, adding, ""A NREGA like programme can be introduced to enable collection of agri-waste.""Praj, at its R&D facility in Pune, is working on multi-grain waste products like corn cobs, rice and wheat straw, among others to convert them into ethanol. ""The government has realised that producing ethanol from agri-waste will be a little expensive to start with. So they are encouraging the oil and marketing companies to start production in the initial stages,"" Chaudhari added.The target of 10% or even slightly higher ethanol blending with petrol (and later diesel), experts say, nicely dovetails with the government's aim to introduce a stringent Bharat Stage - VI emission norm by April 1, 2020.Praj on its part has also set-up a ""green fund,"" which will provide seed capital, in exchange of stake to entities that are looking to set-up ethanol manufacturing plants based on agri-waste.Asked why Praj itself does not get into producing ethanol, Chaudhari said, ""I am doing my job of optimising processes and doing research.""The company is looking to finalise at least one contract on agri-waste-based blending plant by the end of the current financial year - which if materialises, Chaudhari said, ""It should give us reasonable good benefit so that we can be back (in terms of profitability) to where we were 10 years ago."" In the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the company' y-o-y net profit halved to Rs 4.11 crore on income of Rs 205 crore."

When they act, the body exacts a cost for suppressing the pain by affecting the liver since this organ treats all painkillers as poison, even paracetamol. So a patient is caught between taking and not taking medicines and a damaged liver takes months to recover.Almost 60% of dengue patients in Pune end up with such liver dysfunction. Experts who have observed the patients said levels of certain enzymes and proteins in patients' blood go up or drop in reference to the normal count indicating liver problems.Abdominal pain, vomiting and loss of appetite are the earliest symptoms. Yellowish discolouration of the eyes or urine and abdominal tenderness are warning signs of liver damage.Counselling high-risk patients with underlying medical conditions like diabetes and hypertension, stopping medications like paracetamol, known to deteriorate liver function, is still the first line of care. Patients also need supportive care, proper hydration and consistent monitoring of liver function indicators through blood tests.""Dengue virus attacks the cells that cause inflammation in the liver. The Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Amino Alanine Transferase (AST) enzymes increase in number in the blood during the time and may cause complications including damage to liver,"" infectious diseases and internal medicine expert Mahesh Lakhe said.Liver damage in dengue infection is not preventable, but doctors can stop paracetamol and other medicines which can cause liver toxicity , he added ""Liver involvement is more commonly seen in those who have dengue haemorrhagic fever, a severe form of dengue. Early detection can help save lives,"" Lakhe, who is attached to Columbia Asia Hospital, said.Critical care expert Kapil Borawake added that in 60% to 80% patients down with dengue, involvement of liver varies from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to acute fulminant hepatic or liver failure (AFH) which has an incidence of around 5% to 8%.The most commonly used indicators of liver damage are alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), referred to as the SGPT and SGOT.""Levels of these enzymes usually begin to increase from an early stage (day 1-3 of illness) and peak during the second week of illness,"" Borawake said. Proper medical care can help avert liver damage.""Early diagnosis, supportive medications like dextrose infusion, providing clotting products, avoiding liver toxic medications like paracetamol, proper hydration, nutrition and keeping blood pressure normal can prevent liver injury in dengue patients,"" Borawake added.Senior consultant physician Kalyan Gaud said liver gets involved in dengue fever as the virus can directly infect and damage the liver tissue and also due to abnormal immune response of the body against the virus.Doctors also warned against self-medication. ""It may mask the warning signs of dengue resulting in delayed diagnosis and more complications,"" Gaud, who is attached with Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital, said.Pregnant women, infants and old people and those with co-morbid conditions like diabetes, pre-existing liver or kidney ailments are likely to have more complications.""Dengue can precipitate complications of diabetes like acidosis and diabetic patients with liver involvement can develop low blood sugar levels due to diabetes medication and poor oral intake,"" he added.Chief intensivist Prachee Sathe of Ruby Hall Clinic shared her observation about liver damage causing renal dysfunction in dengue patients.""Recently , I had a young patient with dengue who improved and was shifted out of ICU in 2-3 days but his liver condition and renal function worsened so much so that he had to be shifted back to the ICU for dialysis and support for the liver. With supportive treatment he recovered well and went home. Rehydration in the early course of dengue fever is important as it reduces many delayed complications,"" she added."

But New Delhi might not consider withdrawal of Pakistan's status, government sources said.Under the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, countries cannot normally discriminate among their trading partners. If a country grants another country a special favour (e.g. lower customs duty on imports) then it has to offer the same favour to all WTO members.Each member treats all the other members equally as ""most-favoured"" trading partners. The benefits of MFN status is available only to WTO members.However, countries can enter into preferential trade agreements and free trade agreements to grant access and favours over and above MFN.India granted Pakistan MFN status in 1996, and Pakistan is yet to reciprocate. Trade between the two countries never really normalized. Total annual official trade between the two countries was $2.5 billion in 2015-16, whereas annual unofficial trade is estimated to be nearly $15 billion. Asection of Pakistan's industry feels Indian goods will swamp Pakistan if Islamabad grants MFN status to India. There have been talks of granting Non-Discriminatory Market Access (NDMA) to India, which experts believe is MFN in another name.India can move WTO and request for withdrawal of MFN status to Pakistan, citing breach of security. Article 21(b) (III) of WTO rules says that ""nothing in this agreement shall ... prevent any WTO member from taking any action it considers necessary for the protection of its...security interest taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations.""Exports from India will be choked, hurting consumers in some sectors. Trade through the Attari-Wagah border will be hurt. According to a Ficci survey , steel costs in Pakistan would go down by 55%, engineering goods by 26%, bicycles by 20% and pharmaceuticals by 35% if they are imported from India through direct trade channels. Fruits and vegetables would be cheaper by 40% and sugar by 30%. The survey had said that liberalized trade in agriculture would help generate 2.7 lakh jobs in India and 1.7 lakh in Pakistan."

The scheme aims to provide adequate prescribed nutrition to children aged between 7 months and 36 months, who are being weaned. Children are given 2.5 kg of ration comprising a preparation of roasted wheat, Bengal gram, milk powder, sugar and oil besides being fortified with vitamins and minerals.According to the study published this week in the journal PLOS One , around 93.7 percent of caregivers who were surveyed had heard about the scheme, but just over half of the 1,077 children surveyed reported receiving ration regularly. However, about 86 per cent reported having received it at least once. Indicating that the coverage of the scheme was high, but targeted children were unable to avail nutrition, the study found that supply of ration to Anganwadi centres was irregular. The ration is procured by Telangana Foods and later distributed to Anganwadi centres.The programme, like many others, suffered from bifurcation blues and was caught in a resource-sharing dispute between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Officials of the department concerned said those issues have now been addressed.Until May this year, non-payment of dues to the supplier had affected supply. However, the State has paid the dues and is now paying the supplier regularly to ensure regular supply, said K.S.R. Lakshmi, Joint Director (Schemes).The study had also identified a second barrier to effective implementation of the scheme. The authors said sharing of ration within the household was a barrier that could be addressed through larger portions and improving awareness about adequate nutrition for growing children. Despite the sharing, the targeted children could avail as much as 60 percent of their nutrient demand, the study found."

It directed that water be released through direct closed pipelines from upstream reservoirs in Nashik and Nagar districts to Jayakwadi (Paithan) dam that caters to four Marathwada districts of Aurangabad, Beed, Jalna and Parbhani.""The state is the trustee of the water and the public, at large, its beneficiary . Therefore, no citizen or entity is entitled to claim any preferential right to get supply of water in a particular manner or of a particular quantity ...,'' said a bench headed by Justice Abhay Oka. Keeping in mind Article 39, it was the state's ""obligation to equitably distribute river water and water stored in dams for the common good of all"", it added.On the vexed issue of water for Kumbh mela, the high court said: ""If sufficient water cannot be allotted for usage in primary , more essential categories, there cannot be any allocation of water for Kumbh mela and other religious purposes.""In the last two decades, there has been a ""sea change to the scenario with population explosion and climatic changes, unsustainable growth and destruction of environment"", said Justice Oka, who authored the 199-page judgment. ""Water management is one of the most important and challenging issues"" and the ""failure of the state to make equitable distribution of water is leading to serious conflicts"", he added.The landmark judgment came on a bunch of PILs and counter-PILs on release of water from reservoirs in Nashik and other water-rich districts like Ahmednagar to drought-hit Marathwada. The issue before the court was essentially one of how and who should regulate water distribution and its management.The first PILs filed in 2013 questioned the validity of a certain provision of a 2005 state law on water and its regulation -Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act -that promoted equitable distribution during time of scarcity. A Marathwada welfare organization filed a counter, calling for a direction to the state to release water to Jayakwadi to ensure equitable distribution to Marathwada region.During the 2014 drought, proper water supply was orde proper water supply was ordered to Jayakwadi dam from upstream dams catering to Nashik district. A slew of PILs by sugar cooperatives, village panchayats and farmer organizations from mainly North Maharashtra challenged these orders, seeking delineation of water bodies in the state to determine rights of farmers in various regions.Along with release of water, the HC directed the state to strictly observe the 2004 order banning new projects upstream of Jayakwadi. The order, which took into account concerns of all stake-holders from all regions, is bound to be periodically reviewed and has been placed for a compliance report in January."

According to the members of the committee, the city is in dire need of a government engineering college as local talent has to fund for their education in private engineering institutes.The memorandum read, ""The action committee earlier had submitted a similar memorandum to the directorate of technical education. However, no action was taken. The state government has decided to start as many as six government engineering colleges, but none of them are for Kolhapur or surrounding region. The only government engineering college under the Shivaji University is Government Engineering College in Karad. Sadly, it has also got an autonomous status.""According to members, the-Karad based government engineering college has got autonomy and the fee has increased from earlier Rs 20,000 to new Rs 70,000 per year. This is unfair to the bright talent in the region as now they cannot even afford to pay for their education.The members said that Kolhapur has foundry industry, leather works, sugar mills, textiles and jewellery industry which are always in need of scholarly students. For this, the government engineering college might prove to be a great help.The members have demanded to start the engineering college at the earliest so that students can take admissions from the next academic year i.e. 2017-18."

Sugar mills will begin to divert their supply to other sectors such as Indian Made Foreign Liquor that also use ethanol and will provide higher realisations. This step comes after several government moves to boost the supply of ethanol in the first place.A few years ago, the supply of ethanol from the sugar mills was an issue, K. Ravichandran, Senior Vice President and Co-Head, Corporate Sector Rating, ICRA said. Then the government gave ethanol excise duty exemption and also mandated that OMCs blend five per cent of ethanol with petrol.

All he had managed on that occasion was 0 & 3 -combined with 4 & 18 in the previous game at Old Trafford, his two-Test comeback was a disaster, prompting many to write his international career off for good. The left-hander, however, wasn't willing to give in so easily. Those who know him say that while in `exile,' for the last four years, he was disappointed, but not defeated. He continued to introspect and work on his game. Interestingly, he was willing to put the team ahead of his personal cause.As a Delhi skipper, he opted for green tracks, ignoring the advice of his India colleagues to play on flat pitches and make runs to stage a comeback in the Indian team. He made it clear that he didn't want to be selfish, and wouldn't sacrifice the team's cause for his personal cause. In the IPL too, he chose to play on tracks that suited his bowlers and not pitches which would aid slam-bang cricket. The emergence of Murali Vijay, Shikhar and Rahul didn't bother him as he maintained that the only way to beat the competition was by training harder. Looking for an intense workout, he went to Australia and worked with former Australian opener Justin Langer and his personal coach Noddy Holder. Both suggested to him that he should play with a more open stance, so that he could play short-pitched bowling better. To his credit, Gambhir adapted well to this massive change, which is a bit like a golfer changing his swing, and slammed four fifties in the Duleep Trophy.He worked hard on his fitness too, and modified his diet-going completely off carbs, sugar and oily food. It has been almost two years since he hasn't had rice or rotis. Instead of contemplating quitting the sport, Gambhir pressed on the accelerator and made a state-of-the-art indoor batting facility at his home, and a personal gym in Delhi. Even the DDCA doesn't have an indoor batting facility.The Gambhir story, though, isn't so simple. The man is known to have a fiery temper. His clashes with India skipper Virat Kohli (during the IPL in 2013) and Manoj Tiwary (in the last season of the Ranji Trophy) are well-documented. During the last IPL, he kicked a chair in disgust after losing to Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore.It leads one to the question: 'Gambhir ko gussa kyon aata hai?' Those who know him well say that the Delhite's pensive and intense look is just his 'game face.' Off the field, he's extremely jovial and a prankster, something that his teammates vouch for. A close friend of Gambhir stressed that he doesn't have any issues with either MS Dhoni or Kohli.""It's the sheer desire to win at all costs that brought out the conflict between Virat and Gautam. In fact, both he and Virat dined in his Taj Gardenia hotel room the day they fought in Bangalore in 2013, but sadly, these things never get reported. Both admire each other, GG calls Virat 'Cheeks,' while Virat addresses him as 'Bhaiya.' Both love Man United and play stations, and are even currently together in the gym in Indore with Team India trainer Shanker Basu,"" a close friend of Gambhir tells TOI.He also clarified that Gambhir wasn't taking a pot-shot at Dhoni, when he tweeted recently that saying sportspersons didn't deserve to have biopics made on them. The tweet had again triggered speculation that there was a problem between him and Dhoni somewhere. ""He never tweeted against any individual's movie. All he said was that the Indian soldiers deserve a biopic more than a sportsperson. He doesn't feel that MSD was responsible for his exit,"" he says.Another friend describes him as a fierce patriot. ""He's extremely emotional and loves his country to bits. He often says that if he wasn't a cricketer, he would have been in the army. In fact, a couple of years ago, he wanted to join the territorial army."""

The decision was taken by a cabinet committee in its meeting scheduled in Mumbai on Wednesday, bringing respite to both farmers and sugar factories.The sugarcane crushing season generally starts in November every year and continues till April, amounting to around 150 days. Considering the sharp reduction in the sugarcane cultivation area, the state government had taken the decision to delay the crushing season up to December 1. The decision was opposed by sugar factories and farmers organizations like Raju Shetti's Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana.Welcoming the state government's decision, Vijay Autade , executive director of Shahu Sugar Factory, said, ""Sugar factories from South Maharashtra have heaved a sigh of relief following the decision to start crushing from November 5. Immediately after Diwali , the cane cutters will reach the respective regions from their hometown in Beed, Mhaswad and Sangola. It will take around two days and almost all factories will begin crushing by November 5 or 6. All factories are ready and have completed the routine cleaning and other processes required to start crushing.""He further added that there is enough sugarcane cultivation in the South Maharashtra and it was necessary for sugar factories from this region to start crushing in November. ""Besides, the neighbouring Karnataka state had decided to start crushing from November 15 and if these factories had started crushing before the factories from Maharashtra, it would have impacted on sugarcane crushing in South Maharashtra,"" Autade concluded.It should be noted that last year, the crushing season went on till mid-April and total production of sugar touched 83 lakh tonne and the production started at the sugar mills in the district on November 1."

However, there was no activity on the premises for the past 10 years which might have lured back the snakes. With the factory reopening recently -- and the onset of rains -- the vipers have been once again forced out of their habitat prompting action from the wildlife authorities.A senior officer from the factory told TOI that many employees and their children living in the quarters on the factory premises complained about the snakes. Following this, officials obtained permission from the chief wildlife warden, Tamil Nadu to catch the vipers and release them in the nearby reserved forests.Following this, a six-member team of Irula tribals was hired by the factory to catch the vipers. The team came to the factory on Tuesday morning and in the next few hours caught nearly 300 snakes. They put the vipers in gunny bags which were then sealed.""The factory was shut down for 10 years and was reopened only recently. The premises, along with the sugarcane cultivation, are spread over 100 acres. With no activity, dense bushes grew and they were not cleared even after the factory begun functioning. This might have attracted the snakes,"" said a mill staff adding that further movement of the snakes were reported in the boiler area, staff quarters and office premises.Among the venomous snakes, the Irula team caught cobras, Russell's viper and saw-scaled viper. Among them, most were cobras.""We have to see the number of snakes that have survived. We will check on Wednesday and release them in the nearby forest,"" said the officer."

Since the rains are occasional here, farmers have to depend on irrigation methods to water the fields, but Devaraj has managed to harness nature to his advantage. A graduate in agricultural science, he has installed an irrigation pump powered by solar energy.The solar panels automatically tilts to harness sunlight during day. Water is pumped from his open well to a micro irrigation system. Using this combination of solar power and micro irrigation, he cultivates manila tamarind (pithecellobium dulce), jamun (syzygium cumini), chikku and gooseberry trees in his farm. He also cultivates curry leaves as an inter crop between the trees.Under integrated farming method, Devaraj manages to harvest rain water to a farm pond where the open well is situated. He also constructed a pack house to grade his agricultural produces. ""After retiring from my service from State Bank of India , I took up agriculture as a full time profession and utilised my knowledge in agriculture studies to cultivate the land,"" he said.Interacting with district collector K Veera Raghava Rao during the press tour organised by the district information and public relations department on Wednesday, the farmer said he opted for open well as a 5hp AC motor is not enough for bore wells. At least 7.5 HP motor is required if it has to be used with bore wells, he suggested to officials. Similarly Devaraj also petitioned the collector that wild animals like deer and wild boars were causing lot of damage to the crops in the region.According to horticulture officials, 80% subsidy is provided to farmers establishing solar powered irrigation pumps in their farms. Out of 4.39 lakh spent, they can avail a subsidy of 3.35 lakh, said deputy director of horticulture, G O Poopathi.Farmers in arid areas are making best use of the solar powered pumps. Another farmer at Vagaikulam in Thirumangalam block cultivates sugar cane using this solar pump, he said. There are also two more solar pumps established by farmers with the help of the agricultural engineering department, he added."

Similarly, statewide prevalence of obesity in adults (18-59 years) is 11.2%.

So, the department has been forced to reduce the quantity of kerosene to all existing beneficiaries.In a letter to the Union petroleum and natural gas ministry, principal secretary Subodh Agarwal pointed out that, as per existing data, the state has 93,63,780 consumers of kerosene and requires 37,455 kilo litres for supply at the rate of four litres per month/per ration card.But the supply of kerosene by the Union ministry has fallen to 23,676 kilo litres. So, the government has been forced to reduce the quantity of kerosene to beneficiaries from four litres per month to 2.5 litres.He wanted the supply maintained at the previous level until the data of LPG consumers was fed into the system. He said the decision of the petroleum ministry was likely to cause strong resentment among people, especially tribals."

""I have heard fans of Pokemon Go say the game may even be driving a pandemic of sore legs,"" said Delhi-based Misra, adding all the walking would definitely have an effect on blood sugar levels and hypertension.Pokemon Go, which is only the latest version of a 20-year-old Japanese game, has been reviewed in many health websites in the month since its launch. Matt Hoffman, an assistant professor from Texas A&M Nursing College, wrote the game is a catalyst that gets ""people moving"". Players have to walk one to six miles for their Poke eggs to hatch. A professor in community medicine, Dr Irvin Sulapas, from the University of Baylor, said Pokemon Go forced people to interact. ""Instead of playing the game indoors, watching TV, it forces you to go out and interact,"" Sulapas said. An American psychologist has noted the game helps in lowering levels of anxiety and depression.But the moot question is whether Mumbai's schoolchildren will reap health benefits supposedly associated with Pokemon Go? A few year ago, Dr Aashish Contractor, who heads the rehabilitation and sports medicine department of HN Reliance Hospital in Girgaum, had done a study showing Mumbai's schoolchildren were less active than their western counterparts. ""On an average, children studying in classes VII to IX (13-16 age group) took less than 10,000 steps a day while children in the UK and Australia average 12,000 steps,"" he said.Given the sedentary lifestyle that Mumbai's children are forced to adopt because of lack of open spaces as well as the obesity epidemic, doctors feel Pokemon Go should be given a chance. Of course, Poke hunters need to follow safety rules like no Poke-hunts while driving or in inhabitable areas, among others.""Exergames will, undoubtedly, be more used by teenagers and young adults, who are smartphone savvy. Unfortunately, obesity and type 2 diabetes is increasing in such a young population in developing countries, specifically in South Asia. The forecast for 2016 shows about 2 billion smartphone users worldwide and 204 million in India. Such 'exergames' could be used as a novel way to exercise with sustained interest,"" added Dr Misra."

Bad debts and ineffective management have driven the factory to this stage, allege farmers.The other reasons they attribute include fall in total output of sugarcane, the resultant high prices, lack of funds to clean and maintain machinery, settle dues of farmers and pay labourers.The factory in Hallikhed-Bujurg village, 30 km from the district headquarters, was started in 1961-62, by collecting share capital from farmers. Successive governments have provided working capital assistance before every crushing season. But the demand for converting these government funds into state equity has not been met by the state government.The amount of sugarcane crushed has varied over the years, though its optimum capacity is 3,500 tonnes per day. The factory is supposed to function for a season of 100-120 days every year year. But since the quantum of cane crushed had dropped from four lakh tonnes to 70,000 tonnes per season between 2013 to 2015, the unit has serviced only a sixth of the number of farm families in an average year. This year, officials say, the factory may not begin crushing at all.However, alleged non professional management practices, nepotism and even financial irregularities have pushed the factory to making losses. It suffers from an accumulated loss of Rs. 195 crore, half of which are estimated to be unpaid debts.Two inquiries by the Department of Cooperation pointed out that the factory was buying raw materials, other than sugarcane, at inflated prices and selling produce, including sugar and bagasse, at lower than market prices. The inquiries also found that the factory was overstaffed, with the total number of full time and part-time employees stretching beyond 1,100.Administrative boards, headed mostly by politicians, including former minister late Mirajuddin Patel, Subhash Kallur, Eshwar Khandre and Sanjay Kheny, have been at the helm of affairs at the factory in the past. Mr. Kheny, the latest incumbent, has resigned, citing non-cooperation from other board members.Meanwhile, an inquiry under section 64 of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act is still under way. If the government finds evidence of irregularities, the government is empowered to disband the administrative board and appoint a government officer as an administrator.The factory has also failed to repay the nearly Rs. 100 crore loan taken from the District Central Cooperative Bank, Apex Bank and other agencies from time to time.""Since the first crushing season of 1969-70, the factory has been seen as an opportunity to gain clout and economic power by most leaders. Few of them wanted to help us, alleged Vishwanath Patil Koutha, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader.Another KRRS leader Mallikarjun Swamy laments that the factory may be lost for ever. Most leaders have been indulging in party politics, without any concern for farmers, who are the share holding owners of the factory, he alleged.Rajshekar Patil, MLA for Humnabad, has openly complained that the factorys loans were more than the combined value of its real estate and other assets.There is no magic cure for the factorys ills. Everyone concerned should think of novel ways of rescuing it, he said.Deputy Commissioner Anurag Tewari feels the factory can be revived by adopting modern management methods.Infusion of capital, erecting hi-tech machinery, increasing the number of by-products and using the 168 acres of land for setting up a solar park may be the possible solutions.The state government and other stake holders should be able to come up with a solution at the appropriate time, he said."

The cultivation will be done over one lakh acre of land distributed in 350 nurseries across the state.Sugarcane is traditionally cultivated using stem cuttings of good quality cane. For the past few years, researchers were trying to find out methods of directly cultivating the sugarcane saplings. It was found out that direct cultivation helps in reduction in production expenses and also the crop can be harvested more frequently which will prove beneficial for the cultivators.The deputy project director of ATMA, A D Galitkar said, ""We began this initiative two years ago, however, this is the first time that we found out that the increase of the farmers have increased the sugarcane cultivation using saplings prepared in the nurseries. This method has proven beneficial for the farmers since it reduces the harvesting period and thereby the expenses required for irrigation. In all, a good quality crop can be grown with the help of disease free saplings prepared with utmost care and research.""The direct cultivation method has been discovered to increase output and profitability. The ATMA officials have found that the sugarcane produced through nursery method helps in increasing the recovery rate of the sugar production. In the traditional method, the stem cut are planted in the soil and the quality of the seed used is hardly checked. In the nursery method, the cane plants are raised using small chips taken from the each cane with a single bud and then grown in cups. The 25 to 35 day old seedlings are transplanted in the farms.Galitkar said, ""The farmers are now trained and they can start their own nurseries. The cultivation will begin in the month of November. There are around 350 farmers who have developed the nurseries through the efforts taken out by our technical staff. The cost of cultivation can be cut by 50% if this method is set in operation.""For a hectare cultivation of sugarcane, in the case of traditional method around 80 quintals of cane is needed. While in case of nursery method only two quintals of cane is required. The grading can be done in the new method and there is also a scope for intercropping too."

While the yield here is mere 30 to 40 tonnes per acre, in Maharashtra, it goes up to 100 tonnes.We went as a delegation to Maharashtra to know about their cultivation methods. The Chief Minister later asked the farmers to shift to these new methods, and offered to have the repairs done to the factories and hand them over to the farmers. But the farmers have not shown any enthusiasm, Mr. Srinivas Reddy said.Criticising the Congress leader P.Sudarshan Reddys padayatra for governments take over of the factories, the Minister accused Mr. Reddy of thwarting the same earlier during Congress regime. The tour is meant only for political mileage, he said.Responding to the call for his sacking over sale of spurious chilli seed by TPCC president N.Uttam Kumar Reddy, Mr. Srinivas Reddy said the company was brought to pay double the price as compensation to the affected farmers.The Minister questioned why Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy did not resign over housing scams during Congress rule."

We cannot find general anaesthetics or other medication used in surgery, as well as medication for diabetes,"" he added.Location is largely to blame.""The economic situation is bad because the Kurdish areas are surrounded -- to the south there is the Islamic State group, to the north Turkey,"" said analyst Fabrice Balanche.To the east lies the fickle Simalka border crossing with the Kurdistan region of Iraq, whose leaders ""close the border whenever (they) want"", Balanche added.Despite sharing a nominally common cause, Iraqi Kurdistan has tense relations with the ruling Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria's Kurdish regions.It has close ties with Turkey, which considers the PYD to be the Syrian branch of Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), designated a ""terrorist"" group by Ankara.As a result, the sole official trade route in or out for the northeastern portion of the autonomous Kurdish region is frequently closed, often without warning.- Spiralling prices -And the result for residents of the area is shortages and economic hardship.A kilogramme (two pounds) of sugar cost 175 Syrian pounds five months ago but now sells for 800 pounds ($1.60), and flour has shot up from 25 Syrian pounds per kilogramme to 125.Strolling through the shopping market in Qamishli, Mohannad al-Jarba complained that with so few goods, shopkeepers can hike up prices as and when they please.""We're beholden to the seller's conscience because he controls the prices,"" he said.Syria's conflict erupted in March 2011 with anti-government protests across the country, but has since evolved into a complex war for competing zones of control.Syria's Kurds largely declined to side with either regime or rebels, focusing instead on building a semi-autonomous region in Kurdish-majority areas.More recently, the PYD's armed wing has become a key force against IS, fighting the jihadist group with support from the US-led coalition.On the face of it, the Kurdish region has the resources to thrive, including oil fields from which the Kurds have extracted and refined sufficient crude for their own consumption and electricity generation.The self-proclaimed Rojava region also includes large stretches of fertile land, particularly in northeast Hasakeh province, and was once the primary producer of wheat for consumption across Syria.But production has plummeted because of falling soil nutrient levels and IS control over the key trade access routes in the adjacent provinces of Raqa and Deir Ezzor.- Aid not a solution -But residents and Kurdish officials alike lay the lion's share of the blame for their economic woes on the closure of the Simalka crossing in mid-March.They accuse Iraqi Kurdish authorities of shutting the post in response to the declaration of a federal zone in northern Syria on March 17, a development which provoked Turkish anger.The self-proclaimed ""federal system"" is intended to centralise governance in the three Kurdish cantons of Afrin, Kobane, and Jazire in north and northeast Syria.Standing at his post under the beating sun at the border point, Siyamand Usman said the amount of goods entering Kurdish areas in Syria has plunged by 90 percent since March.""We were surprised when the Simalka border crossing was closed at the same time as the announcement of the federal region,"" he told AFP.""The only products that enter stay under the sun for several days and huge fees must be paid to make sure they come in.""In early July, the United Nations began airlifting humanitarian aid from Damascus into Qamishli to support nearly 300,000 people in need.The first delivery carried 40 tonnes of food including rice, salt, and sugar, but Kurdish officials say the assistance from aid groups is only a temporary stopgap.""We're suffering shortages of fruits and vegetables, and we're unable to export or import,"" said Badran Jiya Kurd, advisor to the autonomous administration.""The Syrian regime never created the opportunities for economic advancement in the region, even though our area is rich. It was taking advantage of our resources,"" he said.""The powers that are supporting Rojava militarily are not supporting Rojava economically.""str/mjg/sah/hc/as"

If left untreated it causes irreversible brain damage or death due to hypoglycaemia in infants. Most babies are unresponsive to medical therapy and surgery in the form of near total pancreatectomy (removal of the pancreas in totality or partically) is the only cure.The Paediatric surgical team at the hospital including Dr. Arvind Sabharwal and Dr. Anand Sinha decided to perform a complex Whipple's surgery to remove the head of pancreas along with distal common bile duct and the duodenum (first part of the small intestine immediately beyond the stomach). The surgery lasting 4 hours was well tolerated by the child. The baby was discharged on Monday evening on full oral feeds, maintaining normal glucose levels without any supplements.""Such a condition is caused by abnormal beta cells in the pancreas. These can be of two kinds - as a focal point abnormality (present at a particular part of the pancreas) or as a diffuse lesion (which means spread in the entire pancreas),"" explained Dr Arvind Sabharwal.This infant was diagnosed in the first week of her life and was extensively investigated in Iraq and neighbouring countries.""She had a focal lesion of beta cell hyperplasia in the head of pancreas which was lying very close to the common bile duct. Since near total pancreatectomy leaves a rim of pancreatic tissue adjacent to the common bile duct, it would not have cured this particular case. She was refused surgery at most of the centres of Turkey, Jordan as well as Iraq, she was referred to us. The baby was unresponsive to oral medicines and was on 6 hourly subcutaneous injections of Octreotide to maintain her sugar levels,"" added the specialist."

Before the surgery, the patient's blood sugar was at a high 600 mg/dl. He needed 60 units of insulin every day to survive,"" said Dr Ch Madhusudhan, adding that the Ganesh developed bilateral kidney failure since 8 years and was on regular dialysis at OGH since then.However, post the transplant, Ganesh's blood sugar level has come down to 135 mg/dl and does not require any insulin dose now."
