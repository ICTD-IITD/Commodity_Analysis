A simple registration, without any rituals, was enough for the couple who had first met over Skype. Fifteen days after their wedding, professional commitments forced Claudia to leave for Sao Paulo where she runs a clinic. Six months later, Sumon is now packing his bags for Brazil to meet his beloved. To make the trip special, she has promised to take him to watch the Olympic Games.For the 26 Brazilians in Bengal, the excitement over the Games is no less than what Sumon-Claudia are experiencing now. ""A company managed by city boy Raghav Gupta got the sole franchise of the sale of tickets in India for Rio Olympics. We had heard that some 650 people from India were travelling to Brazil for the Olympics. Among them, 20 would be from Kolkata, excluding journalists,"" Pradeep Khemka, the honorary consul general of Brazil in Kolkata. Khemka himself will not be able to travel to Brazil but will be watching a recording of Saturday's opening ceremony.Two years back, Sumon's friend Abhijit Roy was introduced to Claudia at the Indian Cultural Centre in Brazil. ""At that time, I was looking for a physiotherapist for my mother. Abhijit got Claudia introduced to me. Soon, she started treating my mother via Skype. Slowly, we started bonding. It was Claudia who first mooted the idea of marriage,"" Sumon said. Claudia can speak a bit of Bangla now. ""This is my first visit to Brazil. I could never imagine of going to the Olympics. Now, Claudia is making my dreams come true,"" he said. The couple takes interest in swimming and Suman is looking forward to watching the finals of the swimming competition that will be held in Rio.Two years ago, metallurgical engineer Paulo Nicacio left his hometown Belo Horigonte to come down to Kolkata when he was offered the job of an executive director of a Brazilian company. Apart from Rio, some of the events will be held in his hometown too. But 60-year-old Paulo can't make it home now. So, he is scouting for some bars in Kolkata where he can catch the games on television along with his friends. ""Not just football, I want to watch the swimming and volleyball events too. While I watch, it would be lovely if they serve Caipirinha - Brazil's national cocktail made with cachaca, sugar and lime,"" said Paulo, who returned from Brazil to Kolkata last week.Paulo is hoping that his son, a doctor by profession, will be catching the Games live. ""My son, Lucas, works in Sao Paulo. I'm hoping he will go to the stadium too,"" said Paulo.Two months ago, Adriano Villela came down to Kolkata as a consultant to a Kolkata-based company. His wife and three-year-old son live in Brazil's Porto Alegre. On August 11, Adriano will be off to his hometown. Spending quality time with his family is his priority though he will watch the Games on television. ""I want to catch soccer and volleyball games. Besides, I am also keen on seeing who gets the medal in the men's 100 and 200 metres race. My son likes sports too. We will watch the Games together,"" Adriano said. Before his trip back home, Adriano is going to do some bar-hopping in Kolkata to catch the biggest sporting event on television. And if luck favours, he is even hoping to get nostalgic over Feijoada - Brazil's national dish made of black beans and pork - while watching the events."

While such patriotic calls aimed at targeting Chinese economy may not have the desired effect so soon, history books reveal that a similar movement had actually left Junagadh state financially paralyzed when its Nawab had refused to accede to India.One of the most potent weapon during the 'Arzi Hukumat movement', the campaign against Junagadh Nawab's decision to merge with Pakistan, was economic boycott of the state. The details have been revealed in a book 'Saurashtra no Itihas' (History of Saurashtra) penned by historian S V Jani. In fact, special boycott committees were constituted in various cities across India, which strategically planned the economic collapse of Junagadh state. Junagadh is gearing up to celebrate the Arzi Hukumat Day to commemorate Junagadh liberation and accession to the Indian Union.""Among three major strategies adopted by freedom fighters led by Gandhiji's nephew Shamaldas, economic boycott was adopted as a tool to corner Nawab's state. In fact, the special 'economic boycott department' was set up and headed by Pushpaben Mehta. Boycott committees were set up in Calcutta, Mumbai, Madras, Cochin, Malabar and other cities of the country,"" writes Jani. The committees shot off letters to various institutions which obliged by stopping supply of crucial commodities like petrol, kerosene, garments, sugar and grains to Junagadh. The Indian government stopped supplying coal from October 1, 1947.""The strategy paid off. The railway's daily income plummeted from Rs 30,000 to Rs 5,000 per day and residents, majority of whom were in favour of joining India, stopped paying taxes,"" said Jani in his two-volume book. Of the total 222 princely states in Saurashtra, Junagadh was the biggest with an annual income to the exchequer to the tune of Rs 86 lakh-Rs 90 lakh. Finally, left with no options, Junagadh declared its accession to the Indian Union on November 9, 1947. When Junagadh's economy got weakened due to boycotts, the Nawab turned to Pakistan for help. However, Pakistan demanded money for supply of essentials, which he couldn't afford, said Jani."

Sugar season 2016-17 spans the period between October 1, 2016 and September, 30, 2017. Based on these standards, sugar is prepared by mills for both domestic and commercial purposes.A total of Seven sugar grades namely L 31, L30, M31, M30, S31, S30 and SS 31 based on four crystal sizes, large, medium, small and super small and two colour series 31 & 30 (31 colour series sugar being comparatively better in colour than 30 colour series sugar) were issued by the expert committee having members from Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Bureau of Indian Standards, Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research and Indian Sugar Mills Association.NSI director Prof Narendra Mohan and chairman of the expert committee informed that seven sugar grades, based on four crystal sizes, have been issued by the committee. Based on these standards, sugar is prepared by mills for both domestic and commercial purposes.Prof Mohan informed that these grades released by the expert committee are marked on the sugar bags by the sugar manufacturing firms and a common consumer can easily match these grades with the sugar standard bottle. A common consumer can easily have an idea and be sure about the quality of sugar, he said and added that these grades are indicators of the sugar quality. ""The purpose of releasing these sugar standards is two fold - to maintain the quality of sugar that people consume and to protect their interests"", said Prof Mohan further.He said that the sugar standards in such physical form are being provided for protecting the interest of the common consumer and since sugar is a perishable commodity, the sugar standards are issued every year.""We also closely monitor the quality of sugar being produced in the country, which has improved significantly over the last few years and accordingly up-grade the standards, particularly for the colour value. Previously 29 colour series were also prevalent in the country but the same has been dis-continued and now necessary revision of the IS 498 is being made"", he said.The committee also discussed the issue of reluctance in acceptability of such grades by the overseas buyers and bulk consumer who opt to rely on colour value of the sugar."

Darsan tickets have been made online (at present 26,000 tickets of Rs.300/- are issued online every day) accommodation instant and zero waiting hours in the purchase of the laddu tokens. Thanks to the practical and pragmatic approach being adopted by TTD Executive Officer D. Sambasiva Rao, the elongated darsan lines that regularly spilled out of the massive complexes but on a couple of festive occasions during the year nonetheless remained a thing of the past.The height of the pedestals used in the three-tier darshan system inside the sanctum were evenly raised with a forward slope to further provide a gratifying view of the presiding deity. To cut down the gruelling waiting hours of the devout at the Kalyanakatta, the TTD had resolved to provide honorarium to the Kalyanakattas sevakulu (volunteers) on par with the barbers working on piece rate system.e-lottery systemTo eradicate nepotism and black-marketing of the arjitha seva tickets like Suprabhatam, Thomala and Archana issued under the current booking system across the bank counters, e-lottery system was introduced by the TTD. To check the malpractices being indulged by the laddu staff and maintain the prescribed weight of the saccharine balls, the management had introduced bar-coding of the laddu trays inside the hill temple.Whether it is the purchase of raw materials that runs into several hundred crores of rupees annually or the sale of human hair that fetches hundreds of crores the concept of e-tendering has been made mandatory.Sending shivers down the spine of the manipulators, the TTD for the first time in the recent past also had rejected over 231 tonnes of sugar and 34 tonnes of Bengal gram for failing to meet the tender specifications.Apart from the periodical fares and festivals for which the hill temple is known the town also witnessed two Brahmotsavams. The Vaikunta Ekadasi festival was also observed twice during the year besides the conduct of the six-day Varuna Yagam propitiating the God of rains.Ontimitta templeOn the administrative front, the ancient Ontimitta temple at Kadapa was brought under the control of the TTD and the management also resolved to take up three mega non-conventional power projects  one solar project at Kosuvaripalli and two wind projects at Narayanagiri and Akkagarlagudi areas at Tirumala  to meet its energy requirements. Smashing was the recent decision to restrict the deputation period of officials in the TTD (from other governmental departments) strictly to three years.For the first time in the temple history, the annual budget of the TTD crossed the fascinating mark of over Rs. 2,500 crores.The town which till the end of October reeled under the impact of severe shortage of drinking water also recorded the highest ever rainfall of over 2,100 mm in a year unheard in the temple history  thanks to cyclone Roanu.Meanwhile, several VIPs including foreign dignitaries like  Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, Singapore minister for Home Affairs Iswaran, President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime minister Narendra Modi, besides scores of Chief Ministers of other States like Akhilesh Yadhav, Fadnavis, Siddaramaiah, Raman Singh in addition to several Union Ministers, Governors, Chief Justice of India, judges of other States made a bee line to the hill temple for the darshan of the presiding deity  Lord Venkateswara."

A farmer displays the order in his field near Ambur. Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe delay in settling dues for sugarcane crushed last season has left hundreds of farmers in dismay. Financially hit, the sugarcane farmers say they are in no position to take up cutting this season.Like the Vellore Cooperative Sugar Mill at Ammundi, the Ambur mill too has not settled the dues for sugarcane supplied last crushing season. With the price per tonne last year being Rs. 2,550, farmers registered with the Ambur Cooperative Sugar Mill said the mill is yet to pay Rs. 300 per tonne till date.The Ambur mill has issued cutting order for the forthcoming crushing season. But farmers said they do not have the money to pay for labourers for cutting the cane, and cannot borrow as they were already facing mounting debts.Ramamoorthy, a farmer in Kammavanpettai said, I supplied 150 to 160 tonnes of sugarcane to the Ambur mill last season. I am yet to receive the pending amount of Rs. 300 per tonne. This year, I have raised sugarcane on more than 1.5 acres of land but how can I bear the cutting cost for labourers without the dues being settled?Farmers said that they will have to pay Rs. 450 to Rs. 500 per tonne for labourers as cutting cost. Apart from this, they will have to give one kilo rice and Rs. 25-30 for cooking for each labourer. While the government bears the transportation cost, the farmers said they end up paying the lorry driver at least Rs. 600 to Rs. 700. Our family has been supplying sugarcane for the mill for close to 30 years but this is the first time that the dues have not been settled for nearly a year. In the previous season, the pending amount was settled in six months, he added.D. Kumaran, another sugarcane farmer, had supplied 110 tonnes of sugarcane last season. The mill officers told us that the bills will be settled before Pongal but nothing has happened till now, he said.It is a different problem for another farmer, K. Anbazhagan of Saduperipalayam in Tiruvannamalai district, who had supplied 60 tonnes of cane last season. The mill had diverted the cane to another mill and I am yet to receive the full payment, he said.There are farmers who had borrowed up to Rs. 1 lakh to meet the cutting cost, and had also taken the governments interest-free loan for planting. As the dues have not been settled, the farmers could not repay the loans on time. The interest rate has shot up to 14 per cent now, he said.An official of the Ambur Cooperative Sugar Mill said at a Minister level meeting, it was said that the dues will be settled before Pongal."

The brand has already started experimenting with the formula with their lemon drinks by using stevia (a sugar substitute) instead of sugar, thereby reducing 30% sugar content in these drinks. But soft drinks aren't the only way we rack up our sugar levels, which ultimately lead to health issues. With the festive season around the corner, and all of us gorging on mysorepak, gulab jamun, peda, jangiri and what not, we ask Chennai's sweet-and-savoury makers, and those health-conscious, whether there is a way not to douse Indian sweets in oil, ghee and sugar, and yet, make the trademark sweets and savouries just as delish? Here's what they have to say...People are definitely becoming more health-conscious and they prefer healthier options even when it comes to sweets. That's how we first introduced two of our sugarless items, dates and fig rolls, couple of months ago. Both the items have only natural sweetness of the fruits and have been in good demand since we introduced them. That made us think of two more flavours, cranberry and blueberry, which will be introduced for Deepavali. We work closely with a nutritionist and we're hoping to come out with healthier options by next year.We use a natural sweetener called levulose, which tastes like apple and is commercially made from beet/corn. All the other substitutes for sugar including, saccharin, cyclamate, sucralose, etc are artificial sweeteners and have been proved bad for health in the long run. If you look at the glycaemic index (GI) of levulose, it is only 19 as against the GI of sugar which is 65. Also, it is 1.7 times sweeter than sugar. So, the amount of the levulose needed for sweets is less and that again reduces the calorie intake. It helps keep blood sugar levels under control. We import the basic product, but our range of sweets is made using our patent technology. Though the sweetener is about three times costlier than sugar, the sweets that we sell aren't priced really high. They may be 10% costlier than regular sweets that are available in other stores.We've been selling a few products which are made of sugar substitutes for the last 10 years. But the demand wasn't really good then. However, we see a steep increase in the number of people buying them in the last two-three years. Now, 5% of our total production are sweets made of sugar substitutes. And we expect it to go up to 20-30% in the next few years. Popular sweets like kaju katli are made using dry fruits and honey.Despite the commendable move, I still think it's still a bad idea to consume soft drinks. No matter how much percentage of sugar they reduce, it is essentially water flavouring in sugar. Also, it is calories without any nutritional value. It doesn't hydrate you nor does it have any benefits. It simply has a sweet taste and gets one addicted to it. These drinks are bad for health and people should opt for coconut water or fresh juices instead.The decrease of sugar from beverages and salt from food products is a welcome move. The consumption of soft drinks will have serious repercussions in the long run. The intake of such drinks, even in small quantity, isn't advisable, especially for those who suffer from hypertension, liver-related and heart-related issues. These drinks contain zero calories and the manufacturers come up with marketing stunts often to attract consumers. Nevertheless, the reduction of salt and sugar will be beneficial for youngsters.The sugar and salt content in aerated drinks and junk foods have always been one of the prime reasons for obesity and other issues. Yes, this decision of reducing their quantities in a soft drink is good news. It will benefit mostly those who aren't into fitness and not health-conscious. A good sign among people who do regular workouts, including teenagers, is that they are completely averse to these soft drinks. So, this might not create much impact for them. They prefer fresh juices and other supplements. Earlier, drinking a soft drink was considered to be a cool thing among youngsters, but not anymore. For people who regularly consume such drinks, it's high time they resorted to vaazhaithandu (plantain pith) juice, (to wipe out accumulated fat), cucumber juice (for skin) or ABC (apple, beetroot, carrot) juice for vitamin."

Being small in size, PM 2.5 travels easily through the respiratory tract, sticking to the lungs, causing short term effects such as eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath, apart from worsening asthmatic and heart conditions.Long term exposure causes increased rate of chronic bronchitis and reduced lung function. Heart patients should also take prevention.""Season change with smoke in the air creates additional problems when the pollen and pollutants in air combine. Patients should not overdose or under-dose their medication and take expert help if breathing issues worsen,"" said Dr Ved Prakash of respiratory department of King George's Medical University (KGMU). Not just respiratory issues, ear, nose and throat (ENT) are also under threat from the high decibels of sound and air pollution. ""Every year, there is an influx of 2-2.5% patients of acoustic trauma post-Diwali. Sound levels should be maintained around 80-85 decibels and with cracker noise at around 130 decibels, buzzing, irritation, dizziness, long term hearing impairment and other ear problems start. If not treated early, some might even become irreversible,"" cautioned ENT surgeon Dr Rakesh Srivastava.Air pollution due to Diwali crackers also causes nasal problems like breathing difficulties and collection of fluid behind the ear that may lead to hearing loss. With respiratory issues, the heart is also at a higher risk and irritability, blood pressure and blood sugar rise.""Night coughing is a phenomenon that increases during Diwali. Smoke adds to it and it is advisable to take an anti-allergic seven days prior and post-Diwali. If problem persists, nebulisers and inhalers should be used on prescription,"" added Dr Srivastava."

In India, diabetes is spreading like wildfire and affecting a majority of people. This initiative will ensure that it can be tackled. Efforts to control diabetes should be made throughout the year, Nanwate said.MLC Nago Ganar said that there was lack of proper marketing of ayurvedic medicines and therefore this science was not as popular as other pathies. However, Payal Suryawanshi, one of the doctors at the camps, said that Ayurveda needed no such support or promotion because people knew its effectiveness. Every pathological treatment has its limitations, but I strongly believe that Ayurveda stands for what it is and does not need any brand promotion, he added.Many patients availed the facilities provided at the medical camps. Yashwant Bodkhe , one of the patients suffering from severe back pain, said that I not only got effective treatment but also medicines for free here.

Their story soon drew media attention which resulted in aid for treatment and a happy ending. Picture shows the family at a private hospital in Chennai. PHOTO: SHAJU JOHNFor three generations Jalla Ramanappas family did not have a girl child. In a country where the premium on the male child knows no bounds, the Jalla familys wish for a girl was unusual. But when his sister-in-law delivered the first baby girl followed by the arrival of his own bundle of joy, Gynana Sai, on October 10, 2015, celebrations erupted in the Jalla household.My brother had a son and a daughter and I and my wife yearned for a complete family like his. Our prayers were answered when Gynana was born, a year after my son Sai Tejas birth, says Ramanappa, a farm labourer-turned-salesman. He and his elder brother, Jalla Srinivasulu, a teacher in a private school, got married to two sisters, and live in a modest two-room house in a remote tiny village abutting the first railway station in the area that lent it the name RS Kothapalli in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.Elation, tragedy, reliefEven as celebrations were on there came the tragic news that Gynana was down with jaundice. Doctors at the Desai Hospital in Madanapalle town 30 km away  where she was born  and family elders told Ramanappa and his wife Saraswathi that it is a usual occurrence in newborns, from which they recover in a few days. Days turned into months. There was no sign of improvement. The infant would cry endlessly with stomach pain and pass white stools as soon as her mother fed her milk.Ramanappa soon quit his job in Bengaluru that fetched Rs.10,000 a month to assist his wife in taking care of Gynana. They carried the infant from one hospital to another, first in nearby Madanapalle, then Tirupati and finally Benguluru. It was at the M.S. Ramaiah Hospital in Bengaluru that her disease was diagnosed as biliary atresia, a rare life-threatening condition in which the bile ducts inside or outside the liver do not have normal openings. The hospital performed the Kasai procedure  a way to surgically bypass the ducts and prevent liver damage  but after spending Rs.5 lakh, much of it loan raised against their two-acre land, and five months stay in Bengaluru, the parents realised that the medical intervention did not work. She was referred to a Narayana Hrudalaya Hospitals, also in Bengaluru, where the doctors told the couple that liver transplantation was the only way out.The estimate: Rs.15.60 lakh, plus more on post-operative care and follow-up, a huge amount for a salesman who had run into debts and was struggling to make ends meet. Caught between the impossible task of raising the money and having to see Gynana suffering, the brothers decided to approach a local court seeking mercy killing of the eight-month-old infant. It was a hard decision but we were left with no option. We just could not see her suffer like that, says Srinivasulu.In their heart-wrenching petition in Telugu filed before the Junior Civil Judge, Thamballapalle on August 23, 2016, Ramanappa and Saraswathi narrate their struggle for existence with meagre earnings, the suffering of their daughter and her life-threatening disease; how their life revolved round hospitals for months together: After Narayana Hrudayalaya gave the estimate of about Rs.30 lakh, including post-operative care for a long period, and a deadline of two months for the transplant to be carried out, we tried our best to pool resources. But it was nowhere near the target amount. We expected the government to come to our rescue but there is no hope so far. Governments change seeking votes from people every five years but they dont even take care of basic necessities like health. We have tapped every source from officials to political leaders to non-governmental organisations. We realise it is beyond our means. On the other hand we are unable to see her suffering. Hence we request your permission for her mercy killing. We leave her at your feet to decide her fate. The court turned down the petition for euthanasia, asking them to approach the district court or the High Court in Hyderabad.The couples traumatic story and the way their petition drew media attention in Andhra Pradesh eventually forced Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu to order State financial assistance for Gynanas liver transplant. The Global Hospital in Chennai was picked for the operation. In the run-up to D-Day, August 6, Ramanappa maintained a stringent regimen of diet and exercise to lose 10 kg so as to be able to donate part of his liver to his child. The liver transplant was successful, and doctors say she is now on the road to recovery ahead of her first birthday on October 10.Madanapalle, an area of darknessRamanappa is fortunate that his euthanasia petition jolted the state machinery into enabling a new lease of life for his daughter, but the same cannot be said of others in the arid Madanapalle division of Chittoor district which is witnessing a disturbing trend. At least two other parents in the last three months  and three more in the past  were pushed, under similar tragic circumstances, into moving the courts to seek administered death for their ailing children. The unusual string of petitions have collectively brought to the fore the regions dry landscape-driven poverty, legal limitations in entertaining them, the choices before poor parents of terminally ill children, health-care delivery for the poor, the sad state of primary health care in remote rural areas, the dubious role of corporate hospitals, the lack of health insurance mechanisms and the States pathetic support system for vulnerable sections.The Madanapalle revenue division forms the tail-end of western Chittoor, bordering the drought-prone Anantapur and Kadapa districts and Karnataka. A major portion of this largest administrative unit in Andhra Pradesh comprising 31 mandals (tehsils) is arid and covered by granite formations. There is 80 per cent deficit rainfall on average in the division from January to September, triggering drought year after year and deepening rural poverty, with some parts of Tamballapalle Assembly constituency almost presenting a desert-like spectacle. With no perennial river flowing and farmers depending only on rain and groundwater  a resource that keeps shrinking  large stretches of agriculture lands are left barren. There is no paddy or sugar cane cultivation, only vegetables and groundnut. Landless poor dominate the division while agriculture labourers turn construction workers for survival and keep migrating to Bengaluru and other cities for work. The rich landlords prefer to stay in Tirupati, Chennai and Bengaluru to do business and enable their children to pursue their studies and career. There is no proper health-care facility and people depend mostly on quacks or travel to Madanapalle town or Tirupati for better treatment.The shrinking health coverA World Bank study in 2012 found that health spending was one of the important causes of poverty in India: The countrys public financing for health care is less than one percent of the worlds total health expenditure, although it is home to over 16 per cent of the worlds population. Families meet almost 70 per cent of their health expenses out of their own pockets, placing considerable financial burden on poor households, often pushing them deeper into poverty. Another study found that 35 per cent of the poor Indian households incurred catastrophic health expenditure  the spending on health that threatens the households capacity to maintain a basic standard of living. Add to this the declining expenditure on health as a percentage of gross domestic product over the years and we have a situation where the poor have increasingly shrinking access to health-care services.Ironically the World Bank, in its report, bracketed Andhra Pradesh with a few other States where it noticed a significant increase in the population covered by government-sponsored health insurance schemes in the country in the five years preceding 2012. That was the time the then Chief Minister, the late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, launched the Rajiv Aarogyasri Community Health Insurance Scheme  a scheme still being continued under the current Telugu Desam Party-led government albeit with a new name, Dr. NTR Vaidya Seva. Though the list of diseases covered is pretty long, some relating to cancer have been left out. Another drawback is the insurance cap of Rs.2.5 lakh. The Government of Indias redesigned Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, aimed at providing protection to Below Poverty Line households from financial liabilities arising out of health issues that involve hospitalisation, too touches the fringe of the problem with its limited scope.Pushed into death petitionsTake the case of B. Boddappa, a barber by profession. Shifting from Dinnepalli village to Punganur town to be able to admit his four-year-old son Mahesh in a good school, he was shattered when he came to know that he suffered from blood cancer. From high fever to diagnosis of the dreaded disease, all it took for Mahesh was just three to four months. We have gone through hell. We kept shuttling from hospitals in Madanapalle to Hyderabad to Bengaluru and then finally to Vellore. We ran up a debt of Rs.2 lakh for his treatment. I earn about Rs.250 working in a hair salon from morning till evening and my wife earns Rs.150 a day working as a labourer in the local grain market. From where can I raise the Rs.15 lakh cost estimated by Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC) Vellore? I begged and borrowed and then simply gave up and approached the court as a last resort.In his petition before the Junior Civil Judge, Punganur, on August 8, 2016, he lucidly elucidates why he favoured death for his son: It all started three months ago with his bleeding nose. We took him to a hospital in Tirupati. They conducted tests and referred him to Basavatarakam Indo-American Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Hyderabad. After seeing the medical report they turned us away saying there is no treatment. Then we went to Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health in Bengaluru where the doctors, after treating him for a month, asked us to go to CMC Vellore. It was there that it was confirmed as blood cancer requiring Rs.15 lakh for treatment. For a poor barber with meagre earning this is a tall order. I have already run into a debt of Rs.2 lakh. Please understand my helplessness and my mental agony. I pray with tears in my eyes to allow him to die.Yes, for those who have not gone through the daily suffering, it appears cruel but what should we do in such a situation? We could neither see the pain of our dear one nor could we pool money even to make an attempt to save him, says Bodappas wife, Narsamma. The local media, as in Gynanas case, highlighted Maheshs plight but it came too late and the boy lost his battle with cancer in Bengaluru in August. At their two-room tenement in Punganur, the alphabet and numerals scribbled on the walls remind the grief-stricken couple of how poverty crippled their efforts to save the light of their lives.R. Narayana of Madanapalle town, whose teenaged daughter Reddi Madhavi is virtually on the deathbed after suffering from blood cancer for a year now, faces a similar predicament. I have run into a big debt, spending about Rs.6 lakh on her treatment in hospitals in Tirupati, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Now a hospital in Bengaluru wants us to get Rs.6 lakh more for her treatment. I have two more children to take care. I and my wife work as labourers and together earn about Rs.500 a day and we just cant imagine raising that kind of amount. Nor can we see Madhavis daily battle with cancer any more. Show mercy on us and allow us to take her life, he said in his petition before the Second Additional District Judge, Madanapalle, on July 4, 2016.Unlike other judges who turned away the petitioners with oral orders, the Madanapalle judge wrote down the reason for rejecting the plea. This court has no jurisdiction to entertain this application and they are directed to approach proper forum/court along with supporting documents. Madhavi, who was studying in Class XI when cancer struck, says she is determined to fight the disease and complete her studies if help comes through. But Narayana has run from pillar to post in vain.Petitions seeking mercy killing form only the tip of the iceberg. We know of about a hundred cases of patients suffering from serious diseases committing suicide simply because they were unable to bear medical expenditure. With its vast machinery, the government alone can come to their rescue, says K. Dhanasekaran, who runs Rural Organisation for Poverty Eradication Services (ROPES) with wife Sreelatha. The Chittoor-based NGO has so far referred over 1,000 patients suffering from cancer and liver, kidney and lung ailments to hospitals in big cities.Chittoor District Collector Siddharth Jain feigned ignorance over distressed parents approaching courts with death-seeking petitions. He said he would respond after getting inputs from the concerned departments. Even after a four-day wait he did not respond while two parent-petitioners said they had indeed approached him for financial assistance. The District Medical and Health Officer, Dr. Vijaya Gowri, who took charge recently, too appeared clueless. All that she had to say was this: Since there is no legal sanction for euthanasia in India, there is no point in entertaining such petitions.But the nub of the matter is that these arent really petitions to let die. They are a plea for help to let live.Petitions seeking mercy killing form only the tip of the iceberg. We know of about a hundred cases of patients suffering from serious diseases committing suicide simply because they were unable to bear medical expenditure.K.

Meanwhile, Rita Mary, 70 died on Tuesday. While both the cases were found to have had dengue symptoms, health officials however denied them.Following repeated incidents of fever, health officials took control of the village and scanned every villager for ailments. Deputy director of health services Dr Raveendran said, ""So far, 12 cases of fever have been registered in the village. While none of them have symptoms of dengue, we found four of them suffering from typhoid. A couple of them had symptoms of leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that spreads through the urine of infected animals. It could have spread due to damage in a drinking water pipeline in the village. We have repaired the damage through the assistant ditector, panchayats.""Since few of the villagers have been rearing cattle at their place, there are all possibilities of them infected with leptospirosis. Asked about the two patients who died in the village, he said that they took samples of Saroja but she died even before the report arrived. However, she didn't have symptoms of dengue.In Rita Mary's case, she had high sugar level in blood and high blood pressure which resulted in her death. Moreover, she was over 70 year old.Out of the eight fever cases, four have already been discharged and the platelet count for remaining four is over 1.5 lakh.""However, we want to leave no stone unturned, hence, deployed doctors for night duty as well in the village. Going a step ahead, we have started screening four of the neighbouring panchayats for any cases,"" he said."

SUBRAHMANYAMRapid and haphazard industrialisation of Visakhapatnam during the past four decades has resulted in the city being deprived of its old-world charm and pollution spreading its tentacles contaminating air, ground water and bringing in various other problems, said speakers at a meeting held here on Sunday.The meeting was organised by the Human Rights Forum (HRF) to mark the release of a book Visakhaku 7 va number kalushya hechcharika on the growing pollution and its impact on the lives of the citizens.The speakers recalled how Visakhapatnam, which was cool, had clean air and wide beaches, was increasingly being disturbed by destruction in the name of development.The shrinking shoreline was due to the development at ports and on shore.Communist Party of India (CPI) State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy and HRF district president M. Sharat recalled how they used to play at the RK Beach and other beaches during the 1970s without any fear of drowning.The water, which used to be about half-a-km away from the land in those days, is now barely a few furlongs away, they said.Things have come to such a pass that we cannot walk without slippers even at home. The dust pollution, carried by the winds during summer, has pervaded many parts of the city, including far-away Akkayyapalem and Seethammadhara. During the early 1970s, Visakhapatnam Port was mostly importing commodities like wheat and sugar but after 1980s, coal was the main cargo imported by the port, Mr. Murthy said.A resident of One Town Area in the city and retired employee of the port Ali Khan called for stern measures to check pollution in the Old City."

To set up a coal-fired thermal plant there would cause loss of investment, as the project would lead to a rise in water temperature, causing convection. Coupled with strong winds, this would create cyclones that would damage the project within the next ten years.According to UNESCO, the 1,320-megawatt Rampal super thermal power plant, a joint venture between India and Bangladesh, is to be constructed 65 km from the Sunderbans, a World Heritage site. A report published by UNESCOs World Heritage Centre and The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) mentions key concerns related to the project as being: pollution from coal ash by air, pollution from waste-water and waste ash, increased shipping and dredging, and the cumulative impact of industrial and related development infrastructure.The report also says the flow of freshwater into the Sundarbans has been drastically reduced, resulting in substantial increases in siltation and salinity that are threatening the overall balance of the ecosystem.Human-animal conflictMr. Sahgal, who is also the founding editor of wildlife and ecology magazine Sanctuary Asia , said conflicts between humans and animals is because humans have invaded the animals territory. Just because [politicians] want to win elections, theres no point giving away a part of forests to the people, force them to come there and then expect the animal to understand the signboard (meaning it is a human territory).He also added that ecological problems caused by humans, who believe they control the environment, cannot be rectified as the remedies dont match the damage. People think climate change is a disease. It is not a disease, it is a symptom of the disease that environment is giving you, and the disease is over-consumption of our resources, Mr. Sahgal said. He said the need of the hour is non-carbon energy, more equitable distribution of resources and humility [towards animals and environment], as we are dependent upon them and not the other way around.Water wastageWastage of water is aggravating the problem of climate change by 20 per cent, Mr. Sahgal said. We will never solve the problem of climate change if we waste water on industrial farming, chemical farming, mass-produced meat, sugar and rice production.

The programme now covers around 40,000 residents.The college adopted 15 villages in Arakambakkam and began a weekly chronic diseases clinic in the college in 2003 for the management of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.Over the years, this initiative has grown  a village health empowerment training model was begun in 2012 which trained people on non-communicable diseases, reproductive health, adolescent health and basic life support. They were also trained to assess blood pressure, blood sugar and body mass index.From then on, health kiosks manned by trained volunteers were started in two villages for the early identification of diabetes and hypertension, and those with abnormal levels were referred to the community health centre. From 2013 to 2015, kiosks were set up in 9 villages. and the number of patients registered at the weekly clinic has gone up, thereby helping with early identification, monitoring and control of non-communicable diseases. The kiosks serve 13,779 people.In 2015, breast and cervical cancer screening was initiated in eight villages based on prevalence studies. To support this, a cervical cancer screening unit was established at the college. The mental health department of the college developed a model for the integration of mental health in primary health care and weekly mental health wellness clinics too, were established in 2013.With these comparatively inexpensive village-level kiosks and screening programmes, we have been able to provide effective and efficient primary health care for NCDs, said K R Rajanarayanan, research co-ordinator at the college.The college has set up kiosks in villages for dealing with non-communicable diseases"

It presumed that this would go on to lower consumption and reduce obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay.Health benefitsThe WHO indicated that at least a 20 per cent increase in the retail price of sugary drinks would result in proportional reductions in consumption of such products. Deriving its conclusions from the report Fiscal policies for Diet and Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs), the organisation argued that reduced consumption of sugary drinks means lower intake of free sugars and calories overall, apart from improved nutrition. This again means fewer and fewer people will suffer from overweight, obesity, diabetes and tooth decay in the future.The Director, WHOs Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, Dr. Francesco Branca, went on to explain: Nutritionally, people dont need any sugar in their diet. WHO recommends that if people do consume free sugars, they keep their intake below 10 per cent of their total energy needs, and reduce it to less than 5 per cent for additional health benefits. This is equivalent to less than a single serving (at least 250 ml) of commonly consumed sugary drinks per day.The case in IndiaSo, yes, it does seem that a sweet tooth is all in the mind, the effect of years of conditioning and gratification. Dieticians have argued that the true dependence on sugar started over the last couple of decades with the rampant proliferation of all manner and consistency of sugary drinks. India  if one were to believe the actual numbers of people living with diabetes, at over 60 million in 2013  is sitting on a mountain of sugar. While media reports say that the Union Ministry of Health has been contemplating the regulation of advertising, and increasing the tax on both junk food and sweetened beverages, it is yet to take an actual step. Kerala has done so recently with a tax on some types of foods.Public Health England, an executive agency sponsored by the Department of Health, U.K., in its report, Sugar Reduction: The evidence for action, published nearly a year before the WHOs announcement, said: We are eating too much sugar and it is bad for our health. Its statement set alarm bells ringing on the consumption of sugar and sugar-sweetened drinks in schoolchildren.Independently, an observation by the director, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, R.M. Anjana, from observing patients in the south of the country, was that the consumption of sugary drinks is a major problem in children and this is easily linked to obesity and diabetes. If implemented, like the tobacco tax, which reportedly helped decrease tobacco consumption, such a tax might be able to cut down the consumption of sugary drinks among children and would be a positive step towards preventing obesity.The Chairman, National Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation, Anoop Misra, says the idea could not have come at a better time. Imposing such a tax is an idea we have been advocating. As has been already published, the imposition of such tax will decrease obesity and diabetes in India. Such legal and administrative options in imposition of tax have borne results in other countries such as Mexico. It is also particularly suited for India where sweet and sugar intake is high.But it is important to keep in mind what The Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013-2020 cautions nations about: the tax must be well-implemented, taking into consideration the needs of local communities in order for its benefits to be properly harnessed.ramya.kannan@thehindu.co.inAt least a 20 per cent increase in the retail price of sugary drinks would result in proportional reductions in consumption"

The decision was taken following the decline in the cultivation of sugarcane in the state this year. As per the state government estimates, this year 6.33 lakh hectares are under sugarcane cultivation this year. At the meeting, CM Devendra Fadnavis said, ""The state witnessed drought over the last four years. The cultivation has declined. This year, the state witnessed good rainfall which will help during the next crushing season.""Shetti said he would compel the government to change its decision. ""The decision to delay crushing season is completely wrong and foolish. The sugar factories from Karnataka will start crushing from November 15 and they will be targeting sugarcane from not only villages bordering Karnataka but they can penetrate deep into Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara along with Solapur districts. This will ultimately affect the sugarcane sector from southern Maharashtra, which will not have enough sugarcane for crushing. The ultimate result will be that they will not able to pay farmers their dues,"" he said.""It is surprising that when we are part of the government, they have not discussed the issue with us before taking the decision. When we were out of power, we had fought with government by launching agitations against wrong decisions of government. Now being in the government, we will ask the authorities concerned to reverse the decision as it goes against farmers,"" he said.Vijay Autade, executive director of Shahu Sugar Factory, said though there is decline in the sugarcane cultivation in the state, in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, the decline is only 15% as compared with last year. ""Hence, we will have to start crushing as early as possible. Besides, we also have to compete with sugar factories from neighbouring state, where crushing season starts from November 15. The state government should consider these issues and take appropriate decision in this regard,"" he said.Representatives of sugar mills in the meeting on Monday said they will not get adequate manpower to harvest the crop till Diwali-end. They also said the sugar recovery rate will be low if cane crushing starts early. Experts have maintained that crushing will last for just three months during this season.The meeting also discussed issues such as irrigation of the sugarcane farms and restarting defunct mills. The CM stressed on the use of drip irrigation for sugarcane to reduce water wastage and to set up a committee under cooperatives minister Subhash Deshmukh to draft a policy to re-start defunct mills."

Retail food price eased to 5.9% in August, slower than the previous month's 8.4% increase. Rural inflation slowed to 5.9% in August from 6.7% in July, while urban inflation moderated to 4.2% from 5.4%. Food inflation slowed sharply in both rural and urban areas.The sharp rise in retail inflation in the past few months, fuelled by increase in food prices, had dashed hopes of any cut in interest rates. But robust monsoon rains may have helped in dousing food prices. Vegetables prices eased in August, while prices of cereals, meat and fish softened. Prices of pulses, sugar and confectionary remained pressure points and ruled at double digits.Economists said they expect the central bank to act on rates. ""After RBI kept its policy rate unchanged at 6.5% at the August 9 meeting, this increases chances of a rate cut in October,"" ratings agency Crisil said in a note. ""But RBI may wait for some more time before wielding the knife. We expect the average CPI to stay close to 5% this fiscal, assuming a favourable monsoon with adequate temporal and spatial distribution,"" the agency said.Separate data released by the CSO raised worries about the health of the industrial sector. Industrial output contracted by 2.4% in July led by a decline in manufacturing and capital goods and sluggish output in mining and electricity.The manufacturing sector fell 3.4% in July compared with growth of 4.8% in the same month last year, while the capital goods sector contracted 29.6% compared with growth of 10.1% in July 2015. Economists have raised doubts about the signalling ability of the data as it has remained volatile.""Although lead indicators had pointed to a slowdown in industrial growth, the contraction posted by IIP in July 2016 has come as a surprise, with the performance of manufacturing gloomier than anticipated. However, the steady 5.5-6% growth recorded by consumer durables in the last three months is a source of some comfort,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ratings agency ICRA."

In quantitative terms, 37 lakh kilo of wheat, 8.25 lakh kilo of sugar and 24 lakh litre of kerosene were stopped from going to the black market.At the same time, the system is targeting actual PDS beneficiaries. According to the department, the pilferage of kerosene has been reduced by 40% and wheat by 25% after the introduction of the point of sale machine (POS) which confirm identity with thumb impressions, said a senior official of the department.Out of about 26,000 PDS shops in the state, 24,959 shops have installed POS machines. In some places, however, there are problems of internet connectivity which the state has taken up with the Centre.""Wherever the POS machines are not working due to difficulty in identifying the thumb impressions, the department has given the one-time password option (OTP) and if that also fails, the shop owners have been instructed to supply items after manual recording in registers,"" said principal secretary, food and civil supplies, Dr Subodh Agarwal.He said the department would ensure that none of the beneficiaries of PDS were deprived of their benefits due to digitization as there is a back-up plan to face any possible difficulty. The digitization has helped to salvage the system which was in jeopardy due to massive pilferage and the PDS shop owners were looked upon with suspicion and being labelled as 'thieves'.

After TRS assumed power, old factories like Sirpur Kagaznagar Paper Mill and Rayon Factory at Kamalapur were closed down, forget about the establishment of new factories, he said.Launching a tirade against the TRS government, TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said it is most unfortunate to remind the need of taking over the NSF even after the formation of Telangana. It is shameful on the part of the TRS to forget its promise of taking over the company within 100 days, he added.Workers, employees, students and people at large fought for the separate State believing that their lives would improve.

If completed on time, the 15MW power plants would have helped the electricity board a great deal. Even after six years, the co-generation plant at Alanganallur National Cooperative Sugar Mills, like many other plants in Tamil Nadu, is yet to commence power generation.In 2010, the DMK regime had laid foundation stones for co-generation plants inside sugar mills in the state. The power plants were to utilise sugarcane waste from crushed canes during the crushing period and use coal when sugar mills are closed for maintenance. On an average, the sugarcane waste would have lasted to produce power for eight months.As much as 110 crore was sanctioned for the construction of the power plants with a deadline of 18 months. If they were completed on time, they could have produced collectively 183MW power.State president of Tamil Nadu sugarcane Farmers Association, N Palanisamy said that nearly 80% works have been completed in the power plant at Alanganallur and the remaining 20% of works need more fund. ""Once completed, the power plant will be of great use. The excess power will be supplied to the power grid of the electricity board and the entire Madurai could be supplied electricity from the plant. sugarcane farmers will also benefit from the dividends of power generation,"" he told TOI.Out of the 15MW power produced, the sugar mill will utilise 5MW for functioning and the rest will be given to the electricity board. During the non-crushing months, the entire power generated will be send to the grid."

Hundreds of cane farmers in Thanjavur district placed a petition at the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Kumbakonam raising their demands.Raja Chidambaram, Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam general secretary, Perambalur, said that the total amount of arrears (state advisory price of 450 per tonne) due for cane formers from the public-sector Perambalur Sugar Mills at Eraiyur is 26 crore. ""A total of 21 crore, which was due for 5,071 cane growers registered with Eraiyur Sugar Mills for the period 2015-16 was distributed recently. However, the state advisory price (SAP) of 450 per tonne was not yet disbursed by the government. Since the fair remunerative price (FRP), distributed by the centre is enough only for meeting their debts, cane growers always rely on SAP to meet their family expenses. However, it has not been disbursed even after the festival,"" he said.Meanwhile, hundreds of cane farmers from Thanjavur, led by Swamimalai R Vimalnathan, advisor of Arignar Anna Sugar Mills Cane Growers Association, gathered at he Mahatma Gandhi statue in Kumbakonam on Sunday and raised slogans demanding arrears.

As a first step, a study will be conducted on the properties of wild melon, which belongs to the Cucumis melo category.Vasant Ganiger, Professor in the Vegetable Science Department, who is heading the research, says that Karnataka has several indigenous varieties of vegetable which have medicinal properties.Wild melon is one such variety which is known to almost every farmer in north Karnataka belongs to the region. Yet, this vegetable with anti-oxidant properties is not so popular among people, Prof. Ganiger said.He said that as per initial studies, it had been found that several varieties of this drought-resistant vegetable had an acidic-sweet taste and there were bitter types too. While those with acidic-sweet taste could be used for preparing curry and pickles and could be kept for nearly a month, those with bitter taste could help diabetic patients reduce sugar level.Prof. Ganiger said that as this vegetable had plenty of seeds, he was trying to find out whether they could be used to extract oil. If the presence of oil is found in its seeds, they could be a good alternative to oil seeds.The farmer could cultivate it extensively as it will give them higher revenue. As it is drought resistant, it can be cultivated in the drought-prone district, he said.He said that he had identified some 24 varieties of wild melon found in Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts for research.In future, he plans to conduct research on other varieties such as lettuce. If these vegetables become popular, then they could be a better alternative to traditional vegetables. It will also encourage farmers to cultivate them, Prof. Ganiger said."

The FPS can now sell goods, excluding sugar.""The shopkeepers have now got the permission to stock and sell foodgrains and other items at their will. They will have to continue to stock foodgrains given through the PDS to the beneficiaries,"" a senior officer from the district supply office said.Earlier, the PDS shops were allowed to sell foodgrains, pulses, cereals, kerosene and even other goods, but the practice was stopped for past few years. ""Today, only wheat, rice, sugar and sometimes oil can be sold over the counter and the shop owners sit idle for long period. The new policy is an attempt by the government to give some respite to the shopkeepers,"" the officer said.Nivrutti Kapse , heading the organisation of the fair price shopkeepers, said the decision by the government was welcome in the light of the things that their infrastructure and their time spent in the shops would be utilised in a better manner.""The paltry commission we get is used up in paying the transporters who supply goods to the shop. Besides, not all times the FPS are flooded by the beneficiaries as the numbers of card holders for foodgrains has gone down due to the Food Security Act. So, we have to wait till the consumers come down to the shop to get the goods and we cannot even move out. The new system will thus help us and also the consumer,"" Kapse said.""When we go to FPS we only get government allotted foodgrains and nothing else. We have a rapport with the FPS shopkeeper and we usually take goods on credit from him. If PDS start selling other goods, we will only get the chance to buy them under single roof,"" Hanmant Sathye, one of the beneficiaries said.The shopkeepers have been demanding higher commission for the goods they sell and also that they should be given a dedicated sum per month (as part of honorarium) for running the shop. ""The government has played a smart move by allowing them to sell goods. This way the pressure of increasing commission will automatically go on slow burner,"" the official said."

While obesity levels have shot up in the country since the last NFHS survey in 2005-06, the number of people suffering from hypertension in rural India is, in many cases, higher than in urban parts.The NFHS on Wednesday released the data for 15 States and each State, with the exception of Puducherry, showed a sharp rise in obesity levels among both men and women.In Andhra Pradesh, for instance, where over 10,000 households were surveyed, 45.6 per cent of the total women surveyed in urban areas were found to be overweight  the highest in the country. Obesity among rural women in AP was found to be 27.6 per cent, which may not appear alarming, but is still high compared to other rural parts.Among women, obesity levels shot up from 13.92 per cent in 2005-06 to 19.56 per cent in 2015-16. For men, the rise from the last decade has been from 10.35 per cent to 18.04 per cent.While rural Bihar recorded the fewest number of women suffering from obesity among the 15 States, but more women in rural parts here were found to have hypertension compared to urban parts of Bihar  a trend seen in other parts of the country as well. In Andaman and Nicobar, more men and women in rural parts were found to be suffering from hypertension than in urban centres. This trend was found in Meghalaya too.As for blood sugar levels, most States have maintained the traditional difference between urban and rural areas, with urban centres recording more cases of high blood sugar. The few exceptions have been recorded in Goa where the number of women in rural areas with high blood sugar was more than in urban Goa. The same trend was mapped in Puducherry. In Tripura and also in Haryana, more men in rural areas had high blood sugar than men in urban parts.Health experts said the overall obesity in urban India and rising hypertension in rural India was indicative of the faulty diet of people and also of the stress levels of women in rural India.High stress levels in rural areas are rooted in income, agriculture and high cost of healthcare. Also on the food front, there is lack of potassium-rich food like fruits and vegetables, said health expert Veena Shatrugna, former deputy director of the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad."

Besides, he added, not only will the Congress government continue with the aata-daal scheme, but will also provide tea and sugar along with it.Capt Amarinder also urged the Valmiki brotherhood to ensure that they support the Congress. He said the Congress party has a long history and relationship with Valmiki Samaj. ""You are our actual strength,"" he said.While addressing the programme, AICC in-charge for Punjab Asha Kumar appealed to the people to ensure that they helped in forming the Congress government under the leadership of Capt Amarinder Singh in Punjab. She said whatever promises are made to the Samaj will be fulfilled.Maintaining that the Congress party was committed to the welfare and upliftment of the downtrodden people, Kumari said if any party had watched the interests of the socially and economically weaker sections of the society, it was only the Congress party.Senior party leader Dr Raj Kumar Verka also addressed the programme and listed several demands of the Samaj before Amarinder."

""This is news to me. We have not made any statements about that (Sharif's visit to Washington),"" Peter Lavoy, special assistant to the US president and senior director for south asian affairs at the national security council of the White House, told PTI. ""If it is pakka (final) you would be the first to hear.""The rethink  or at least holding back the announcement  of the visit comes after the administration conveyed to Islamabad that it will not certify the effectiveness of Pakistan counterterrorism operation to Congress to enable passage of the Coalition Support Fund (CSF), the military reimbursement aid that goes towards keeping Pakistan solvent.As part of its rentier-state ethos, Pakistan provides logistical support to US and coalition forces in Afghanistan and in turn bills Washington for reimbursement.The CSF was scheduled to end following the US drawdown from Afghanistan in December 2014, but the Obama government extended the program for another year through a legislation containing additional conditions, including a requirement for certification by the defence secretary that Pakistani military operations are rolling up terrorist networks, including the Haqqani group in North Waziristan.But true to form, Pakistan's military-intelligence establishment has again suckered Washington fooling the US by keeping the death from illnesses of Taliban supremo Mullah Omar and Jalalludin Haqqani while trying to manage their succession.The manipulation, coming after Osama bin Laden being sheltered in Abbottabad, has further eroded trust in a country with a long history of lying and dissembling. Although US policy of forbearance is centered around its fear of Pakistan's collapse, that tolerance is being tested in the face of the Pakistani military-intelligence's serial malfeasance, including its continued patronage of terrorists associated with the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in which six Americans died.""The US move is politically more damaging for Islamabad than its financial impact, which is significant nevertheless for being an important source for narrowing the current account deficit. More importantly, it coincided with the deterioration in ties with Afghanistan because of Kabul's allegations that Islamabad continued to harbor Taliban bases from where attacks were being launched,"" Karachi's Dawn newspaper, which first reported the rupture, said on Thursday.""The US decision is also likely to sour ties in the run-up to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's scheduled visit to White House in October,"" it added.Pakistan's economy is both parlous and perilously-poised, despite frequent juggling of numbers in a country that does not even conduct a regular census. With economic growth barely matching projected population growth, it is reduced to living on aid and remittances. Even aid is starting to dwindle after its familiar patrons in the Gulf have pulled the plug and its sugar daddy China has not come through with the expected bail-outs.Desperate to keep the US pipeline open, the Pakistani military, which runs the country's foreign policy on behalf of the nominal civilian government, has been decimating its civilian population with every-day air-strikes this week in North Waziristan, announcing dozens of dead ""militants"" which no one is able to authenticate due to lack of access.However, the country's continued patronage of terrorists on its eastern flank with India, including its protection of UN designated terrorists such as Hafiz Saeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, indicates there has been no fundamental change in its policy.With Pakistan's salience to American objectives declining in the context of US outreach to Iran and the drawdown in Afghanistan, some scholars are now pressing for a review of Washington's ties with Islamabad. In a Foreign Affairs magazine piece headlined ""An Unworthy Ally,"" C Christine Fair and Sumit Ganguly have argued that the time has come for Washington to ""cut Pakistan loose,"" going as far as to suggest punitive sanctions against Pakistani elite, including visa denials to its top generals and officials who support terrorism.* ""Since the current approach has little chance of aligning Pakistan's interests with those of the United States, the time has come for Washington to change course. If Washington cannot end Pakistan's noxious behaviors, it should at least stop sponsoring them.""* ""Despite Barack Obama's understanding of Pakistan's misdeeds ... his administration, like his predecessor's, has failed to develop policies that limit American complicity in them. As a result, Washington has continued to pay Pakistan to do what any sovereign state should do: eliminate terrorists exploiting its territory.""* ""All the while, the United States has not required Pakistan to stop backing militant groups, such as the Afghan Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, even as Islamabad battles those militants who have turned against the state. Indeed, Islamabad has created a permanent revenue stream by arguing that so long as it is fighting militants, it should be entitled to US aid. The United States has been willing to comply because it considers the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons a core national interest.""* ""The strategic demands of today's South Asia are distinct from those of the Cold War era, but the central dynamic of US-Pakistani relations remains constant. The United States turns a blind eye to Pakistan's misdeeds because it depends on the country's leaders to counter US enemies in the region-first the Soviets, now the melange of militant groups active in Afghanistan and Pakistan. As a result, the United States has subsidized both the expansion of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and its stable of Islamist terrorists through programs ostensibly created to manage those same concerns.""* ""Past attempts to induce Pakistan to change its behavior have largely failed, and there is little reason to believe that a change in course is imminent. Indeed, what little convergence of interests existed between Washington and Islamabad during the Cold War has long since disappeared. After six decades of policy predicated on Pakistani blackmail, it should be possible to achieve US interests with a different approach.""* ""A strategy of containment is the United States' best option. Above all, US relations with Pakistan should be premised on the understanding that Pakistan is a hostile state, rather than an ally or a partner."""

Like food critic Anton Ego in Ratatouille , I was transported back to the breezy evening my mother had slipped one into my custard. This transcendental appreciation mustve been louder than I recall. My Airbnb host squirmed as if he were Harry tolerating my Sally moment. He formed one half of the middle-aged gay Austrian couple that had rented out their sofa to me.It tastes so homely, I sighed. Not much of a home though, he remarked, half jokingly, before rushing to get dressed. I could swear I saw a wistful smile.Thats when it struck me. In my week there, I had never seen them together. Before your sci-fi genes conjure up the Fincher-ish theory that they were one person, the reality of it was far more profound. He worked at a beauty saloon through the day; his partner worked the nightshift as a guard. Their hours never overlapped. Their happily ever after was, in fact, a resounding tragedy.Soon after, I confronted the cruel universality of this irony in Aditya Vikram Senguptas Bengali film, Asha Jaoar Majhe . At first, I wondered why I was being shown solitary chores of a jobless young man (Ritwick Chakraborty) and a busy woman (Basabdutta Chatterjee).Slowly, the smokescreen clears. A familiar pattern reveals itself. She phones him from the bag-making factory she works at. He cuts the call, and proceeds to switch on the water pump; later that night, she bathes with this water.Another missed call, and he buys fish from the market; at dawn, she cooks macher jhol for his lunch. His missed call after his printing-press night shift serves as her wakeup alarm. A home built on terminated gestures of acknowledgment. Echoing ringtones replace Post-it notes, and wordless reminders replace sweet nothings. A married couple trudging through life separately so that they can be together.My host, too, had placed an extra breakfast on the counter that morning. He left the geyser running. After work, dinner would wait for him on a table with one chair. When hed hit the sack, it was the empty side of the bed that distracted me. And the pillow hed embrace.Senguptas landscape reeks of isolation: no dialogues, a tale told through the soundscape and vignettes of a recession-hit Kolkata, and most notably, quiet hints of a backstory  perhaps a defiant courtship that mustve found root in the arts.Occasionally, lilting tracks of old Bengali songs drown out the ambience, ones that perhaps led her to become a failed singer. And he is perhaps forced to find music in the noise of words being printed, instead of his own ageing words.Similarly, my hosts preserved photographs of the families that had disowned them. Theirs was a fiercely private quest to abandon loneliness. Suddenly, sexual identity wasnt their gravest challenge; it was but a subset of their enduring struggle for validation. Here they were, languidly searching for binary souvenirs in a singular, monotonous existence.This condition assumes many forms: Husbands working abroad to support their family, the BPO lifestyle, long-distance couples working towards a closer future. Love becomes a luxury, and they look for it in seemingly mundane aspects: Skype dates, money transfers, or in this films case, a shared cup of tea  in the timeless vacuum between the end of his day and the beginning of hers.The 31-year-old filmmaker paints a brooding picture of a day in these lives, where pining has no voice, and is restricted to fleeting glimpses and stolen minutes. That morning, the strawberry and I became chapters in a burgeoning book of longing.With the sugar rush, I inadvertently broke his coffee machine. This cost him 15 precious minutes. Just before he left, his partner walked in. It had been five long days. As they hugged, I felt like the gentle mist shaping their soft-lit dream sequence.(The writer is a freelance film critic, writer and habitual solo traveller)"

""We have no letter to show that the government has agreed to pay for the treatment,"" he said.Srikanth said he received a call from a senior state government official while the hospital received a communication from the chief minister's office for the same. This was also confirmed by an administrative official of the hospital. Srikanth as well as Somnath's colleague Deepal Birhade, a company secretary, said that while he has gained consciousness, Somnath is in a lot of pain, which makes it difficult for him to talk.Despite Somnath's condition, his worried parents are unable to come see him. ""Our mother cannot move around much due to her health, so she is at our native place, and our father is tending to the fields while I am away,"" Srikanth said.A team of doctors, led by Parag Sancheti and Shailesh Hadgaonkar, is observing Somnath's vitals to decide on the right time for a surgery. ""Somnath is experiencing spinal shock, which has has presently put his lower body in a paralysed state. His sugar level is very high and his blood pressure is fluctuating.

Mini hard-boiled candies in the shape of lemons, watermelons and strawberries with intricate detailing of the fruit make for a tempting sight.For the sake of hygiene, visitors cannot enter the room where the candy mixture of water, sugar and glucose is being slow boiled. Theres also a separate section thats designated for a marble-top cooling station, where the candy mixture is poured for cooling and the induction-induced hot table for crafting the candy.You can expect theatrics as two senior candy makers, Sumit Sehgal and Garrison Musquitta, have spent three months in Barcelona, Spain, to train in the art of candy making. They run the store for Burgundy Hospitality, the folks behind Royce Chocolate in India, which has brought the candy brand.We spent the first month learning how to make basic candy, using water, glucose and sugar, after which we moved to using fruits, and then the tough part of customisation: logos, alphabets, letters and even faces. It is like an art puzzle that comes together into desired shapes and words, says Sehgal, checking the induction cooker on which the mixture for hard-boiled candy is on its way to a slow boil.On offer are sweets in the shape of inch-size pillows, and small, medium and large lollipops, which are circular and heart-shaped. The candy-making duo is also trained in print-a-pop lollipops, where edible pictures are printed onto candy, and making hand-drawn faces.The sweetest demoBoth Sehgal and Musquitta pad up with fire-resistant aprons and gloves, for the pot of candy solution will be poured on a cooling marble-top, where it will become a soft and playful mixture. As it cools down, it turns into a transparent clay-like form with a temperature of 170C.We let it cool down to around 130 Celsius and then add edible colours, says Musquitta, pouring red on the left bottom corner, and spreading it with a spatula. On the far right, Sehgal adds green, and ensures the colours dont mix. Due to the cool temperature of the colour we add, the mixture bubbles, Sehgal says.He then uses a pair of scissors to cut out green, yellow and red-coloured chunks. They will work on them separately first.Musquitta kneads the white candy mixture, but he needs to make it fluffier as it goes into the centre filling, wrapped in a colourful candy layer. For this, he hangs it on a hook, and skillfully stretches it, to give it a softer, smoother finish. Meanwhile, Sehgals nimble fingers create neat, colourful slabs which he straightens out. Between the three coloured strips, he adds a thin white candy strip to form a pinstripe.A completely handcrafted process, he now covers a cylindrical white candy slab with the colourful outer layer. He rolls it evenly on the warm table, thinning it in the process. It looks like a candy snake, and is now ready to go into the pillow mould cutter.Musquitta, on the other end, is receiving the semi-cut pillow candy strip that will be cut and packed once cooled. The entire process takes 30 minutes, and all the workers and set up staff have stopped their work to watch the show. He offers us a piece. Still hot, the candy has a Jamaican flavour, and tastes like a pina colada.Sehgal says, The minimum batch of customised candy starts from four kg and goes up to 12 kg. We also make marshmallows, a process which takes one-and-a-half hours. These too require the same ingredients. The only difference is gelatin is added in the blender in the end, along with the colour. Sehgal confesses that the training was like going back to a science lab. It is all about the temperature. If it is too low, the candy will not bind, and if it is high, the sugar will burn.Indian flavoursSehgal offers a candy from their limited edition of Indian flavours. Something is not right, for it tastes like biryani. It is biryani, laughs Sehgal, adding that the other flavours include kulfi, kala khatta and badam halwa. These flavours are in a liquid form and contain alcohol, which evaporates in such a high temperature.The author is a freelance writer"

Though there were reports that the proposed refinery would provide employment to about 1,600 people, it would impact the lives of lakhs of sugarcane farmers and farm workers and thousands of sugarcane factory workers in the State as the existing sugar factories would be forced to close down, they said, adding, the government was requested to shelve it proposals.Addressing the gathering, Former Minister Vadde Sobanadreeswara Rao said that the Andhra Pradesh used to be in the third position with regard to sugar production in the country. But, it slid to fifth position due to the government policies.The sugarcane farmers were already facing hardships for various reasons, including the policies. Sugarcane cultivation was coming down as the farmers were not getting remunerative price. They would be at receiving end if the Multinational Companies (MNCs) were allowed, he said, adding, the farmers should express their resentment through protests and objections.Federation of Sugarcane Growers Associations secretary N .S .V. Sarma said that eight sugar factories in the State were already closed down due to losses in the last four years and a few others were struggling for existence. The remaining 21 sugar factories would also be closed down if the government gave permission for setting up Refinery unit in Nellore district, he felt.AP Rytu Sangham vice-president Y Kesava Rao, State Rytu Sangham general secretary Vangala Subba Rao, AP Rytu Sangham state committee member Talupula Sudhakar and sugarcane farmers others spoke."

They have been advised to go through weekly check-ups at community health centres and district hospitals. A total 23,055 pregnant women were examined by the district health officials.The health department has decided to observe October 24 and 25 as HRP day when all those identified as HRP would be examined at all the CHCs, PHCs and anganwadi centres.Pregnant women having low or high blood pressure or blood sugar or iron deficiency or are expecting twins fall in the HRP category. Those below 21 years or above 35 years of age also fall in this category. The health department will now ensure that the delivery of all the HRP cases is done in the hospital only so that extra medical attention can be provided to them. ASHA, ANM and anganwadi workers have been given the responsibility of ensuring that all the women with HRP go for regular check-ups.Blood transfusion is mandatory for all anaemic women with very low RBC count and the facility of blood transfusion is provided to them at the district hospital. During the motherhood week, all the pregnant woman were given 100 iron and calcium tablets for free. The idea to celebrate the motherhood week is to bring down mortality rate during delivery and identify potential high risk cases.

Had he accepted the report of a pathological lab on the city's Govind Mitra Road at face value, he would have to. A blood donor with connections in the medical fraternity, the man in mid-40s went for a second and even third opinion, and ""I am saved, you see"".The Bank Road lab's test report showed Hissariya's postprandial blood glucose level at 148mg/dl on October 4. Only a day earlier, his peak level of the blood sugar was reported to be 356mg/dl by the Govind Mitra Road lab!A tad confused, Hissariya had his blood sample taken two hours after meal by a big-banner lab's franchise in the city. Its result matched with the Bank Road lab's. ""Mind it, I had the blood taken out of my veins exactly 120 minutes after the meal -- at all the three labs,"" said Hissariya who runs a drug store on Govind Mitra Road.What added to the indignation of Hissariya was the ""utterly irresponsible"" response of the ""erring"" lab when he went to complain about the ""criminal negligence"". ""They nonchalantly offered me to repeat the test for free if I so wished,"" he told TOI earlier this week.Hissariya's is not a one-off case. Doctors are also complaining. Not only physicians, pathologists too rue the mushrooming growth of illegal labs. The Bihar chapter of Indian Association of Pathologists and Microbiologists (IAPM) has even filed a PIL in the Patna high court, seeking a directive to the government to crack down on such labs.The IAPM had in fact written to the Medical Council of India as well as the Bihar health department bosses in 2014, complaining about this. ""Patients are wrongly being diagnosed and thus wrongly treated,"" the letter read and added patients' life was in danger due to the mafia's stranglehold on this life-saving diagnostic field.The letter made startling revelations. While MCI rules prescribe a pathological lab must have a dedicated pathologist who should sign every test report, the letter hinted many labs were being run by technicians. ""Pathologists' name and signature are being misused (forged)... For example, one particular pathologist is (purported to be) present in ten different districts of the state on the same date, which is impossible,"" the letter pointed out.The letter, also marked to Union health ministry officials, alleged most labs in Bihar lacked proper diagnostic equipment, qualified technicians and qualified phlebotomist (who collects blood samples from patients).""According to MCI rules, one pathologist can give services in not more than five labs and that too within a prescribed distance. Patna has at best 50 trained pathologists, but even a conservative estimate puts the number of labs in the city at 2,000. Who are managing them? Labs can be found wholesale outside big hospitals like PMCH, NMCH and IGIMS. The gullible masses suffer,"" IAPM's Bihar chapter joint secretary Dr Prabhat Ranjan fumed.However, the administration pleads helplessness. ""The Patna high court earlier this year ordered no coercive action against the labs or hospitals not registered under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act. What can we do?"" asked Patna civil surgeon Dr G S Singh.The IAPM still sees a way out. ""The high courts of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, MP and UP have ruled in favour of MCI rules. Using these rulings, the Bhagalpur and Purnia civil surgeons ordered raids on labs in 2014. Many of them were found running without qualified pathologists,"" Dr Ranjan claimed and wondered why couldn't the Patna civil surgeon take a cue from his Purnia and Bhagalpur counterparts.The International Standards Organisation and the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) are into certifying medical labs. Though not mandatory, the accreditation by these non-government bodies is considered by experts as a proof of quality infrastructure at the certified lab. Bihar has only ten NABL-accreditated labs."

Kiran Kumar Reddy.It is our Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao who released Rs.480 crore input subsidy, and Rs.11 crore arrears to red jowar farmers immediately after he came to power. When red jowar farmers sought release of arrears, the Congress regime resorted to police firing on them at Armoor, he said.Mr. Ganga Reddy said that farmers did not forget Congress misrule and the injustice meted out to them.

Among the other points of discussion were quality of B-Twill bags used for packing foodgrains, productivity norms for man and machine, increasing exports and jute goods diversification.The issue of improved living and working conditions, and compliance with statutory payments and payments of workers dues came up for discussion.The issue of the protection extended to the jute industry featured prominently. It was pointed out that the Jute Packaging Materials Act , 1987 was meant as a support to the industry and not a substitute to the industrys growth and development.Over the years, the Act has undergone substantial dilution. While fertiliser and cement sectors have been totally exempted from using jute packaging, there has been relaxation in case of sugar and foodgrains as well. As against 100 per cent norm, only 20 per cent of the sugar output and 90 per cent of foodgrains are required to be packed in B-Twill sacking now.The domestic market was the mainstay of of the 12.3 lakh tonnes jute goods industry with 74 per cent of the output being accounted for by sackings. Domestic consumption was 87 per cent of consumption with only 13 per cent of this product heading to the export markets.Bag qualityAdmitting that the level of dependence on government for selling sacking was high, the industry said that the quality of the raw jute fibre in India was a reason behind the industrys lopsided product mix. The industry depends to a large extent on fibre import from Bangladesh, its key competitor.The meeting also flagged the issue of the quality of jute bags and import of bags from two neighbouring countries, against whom anti-dumping investigations have been started recently.

However, among the variety of options, jilebi is served as the celebration sweet of IndiaThe Salem Jilebi prepared by a group of families in Guhai area in Salem city is a major attraction with the people of the western districts.About 15 families are involved in making this traditional jilebi in their households for the past many decades in Guhai area. This sweet is very popular and in good demand not only among the local people, but also among business houses, which offer them as Deepavali gift to their workers.It is common to spot men and women preparing the traditional jilebi in their houses in the Mariamman-Kaliamman temple street in Guhai during round the year. During the Deepavali festival season, the demand is so high, that all members of the family are involved in making this sweet since break of the dawn till late evening hours.The taste of Salem jilebi remains constant for many decades thanks to years of experience of the people. This sweet is made by deep frying batter in circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup.As usual, the families involved in this business started receiving Deepavali orders from all sections of the society one month ahead. The main customers are the people who collect monthly instalments from the working class and weaker sections for meeting the expenses during the Deepavali festival. Many such customers have been placing orders with these families for years together.Many business houses too have placed orders with these families, which have kept them on their toes to meet the deadline.According to M. Rajasekaran of Sri Shanmugavilas Jilebi Kadai in Mariamman Temple street, it was his grandfather Vasu Iyer who initiated the process of making jilebis in the house holds mainly to serve the weaker sections. It became so popular and thriving business about 50 families were involved in this trade till a few decades ago. With many descendants after acquiring education moving away in search of jobs, at present only 15 families are continuing this practice.The main advantages of the Salem jilebi are that they are made in households in a hygienic condition by experienced hands, use quality ingredients and the reasonable price, Mr. Rajasekaran says. Due to heavy demand, the members of his sisters families too join him during the Deepavali season to meet the demand. At present about 15 members belonging to four close relatives are involved in preparing the jilebi in his household, Mr. Rajasekaran says.The quality and the low price, made jilebi an instant hit with the poor people. We are leaving no stone unturned to ensure the quality of jilebi, despite fall in the profit rate due to steep hike in the price of all ingredients. The apprehension of losing the patronage of customers, we are not able to hike the price too. Further, the competition from the major sweet stalls has made us to wage a rigorous battle for our survival, he adds.The popularity of Salem jilebi could be understand from the fact that they are now been taken to foreign countries by the native of this district.Now, these tradition people too have started adopting latest packing methods to face the competition. Earlier we used to pack the jilebi in banana leaves. Later we switched over to paper covers and now we use extravagantly decorated boxes, he adds.This delicious sweet is priced at Rs. 200 a kg and this proves a big boon to the poor and downtrodden in celebrating the festival.Adulteration will not be allowedThe Food Safety and Drug Administration Department is going all out to check adulteration in the preparation of Deepavali sweets.A team of officials led by T. Anuradha, Designated Officer of the Department, has been visiting various sweetmeat stalls in Salem city and other parts of the district to ensure that only quality ingredients such as dal, ghee, edible oil, jaggery are used in the preparation of Deepavali sweets. The team on Monday visited the sweet stalls functioning in Shevvapet and checked the quality of all ingredients.Dr. Anuradha has also issued strict directive on the formalities to be adopted by the workers involved in the preparation of sweets. They have been directed to adopt hygienic techniques and keep the surroundings neat and tidy. The team members collected samples of the sweets and sent the same to the testing laboratory.Dr. Anuradha said that the department officials have been conducting surprise checks in the sweetmeat stalls for the past two weeks. The households where sweets are prepared for local sales were also inspected.The consumers purchasing savouries should check the packing date and expiry date on the packets.

And if you want to learn of the sheer variety of desserts of a runny consistency the lady of such a household can prepare, this is the moment you need to seize.Catholic households in Goa are known to make rice dessert with sheaves of the season's first harvest thrown in to celebrate the konsachem fest. The equivalent of this practice can be seen on day two of Ganesh Chaturthi in Hindu homes.The preparation is strikingly similar.Rice of an aromatic variety is boiled and cooked with few soaked sabudana globules in milk. Sugar, cashewnut pieces, and a haldi leaf are added to the preparation, and the sheaves of the newly harvested rice are thrown in last. Needless to say, the aroma of the rice, the haldi leaf, and the freshly-harvested rice combine into a heavenly experience for the senses when eating this kheer.Sabudana always makes an appearance on days when Hindus are required to observe a fast or just any auspicious occasion in Hindu households.Kheers with sabudana as an ingredient are aplenty, as the globules help bring volume and give a fuller texture to the runny dishes.One homemaker in Margao prepares banana kheer during Ganesh Chaturthi with soaked sabudana, coconut milk, banana, jaggery, and the haldi leaf as its ingredients.Manganem is another favourite in many households during Ganesh Chaturthi.""Soak the chana dal for 20 minutes, Cook it, and keep it aside,"" explains Sonali Vernekar from Mapusa. ""Keep the first thick coconut milk extract that you get separately from the thin extract that you get from the grated coconut later. Cook this thin extract with jaggery, the boiled chana dal and salt. Add little sugar as this enhances the taste. Add pieces of cashewnut and roasted sesame seeds and the thick coconut milk last, and bring to a boil. Add soaked sabudana to the dish, take the dish off the gas stove, and keep it covered for 20 minutes for the sabudana to cook inside.""Manganem is also high in nutritional value and so is the moongachem konn and soji made during the festival. This is the reason these desserts are not restricted to the Ganesh Chaturthi festival alone. This is also reason to not to hold yourself back from asking for a second helping of these sweet dishes when you visit your friend's home on Ganesh Chaturthi."

The order is not being followed. File PhotoThe National Farmers Organisation, headed by advocate B.P. Sheri of Belagavi, demanded that the State government announce a State Advisory Price (SAP) for sugarcane for the year 2016-17.Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Sheri said that the State government had announced SAP for the sugarcane crushing season of 2013-14 but failed to announce it for subsequent years leading to open loot and exploitation of the growers by sugar mills. Quoting a Supreme Court judgement, he said that in the event of the State government failing to announce SAP for any given year or years, the SAP announced for the preceding year shall prevail till the government announces revised SAP. But, neither was the government willing to honour this apex courts judgement nor were the various farmers organisations aware of it, he said.Mr. Sheri said the Supreme Court in a case had directed the sugar mills to pay additional price of Rs.160 per tonne of sugarcane to the growers for the year 2003-04 within three months from the date of the court order dated March 3, 2016 along with interest. Yet, the order was not being honoured by the mills and the State government had conveniently maintained silence on the issue.Memorandum submittedThe Bharatiya Krishik Samaj Samyukt activists led by State president Sidgouda Modgi submitted a memorandum to Revenue Minister Kagodu Thimappa during the latters visit to the city during the day and urged to decentralise the system of issuing various certificates and documents and make them available through the Gram Panchayats.He said as almost all gram panchayats are equipped with computer systems and internet connections, there should not be any problem in issuing these certificates through them. Presently, these documents are being issued at hobli centres, some of which were far away from villages. The benefits of technological developments should reach grass-roots level, he said."

The farmers planned to organise a meeting in the first week of November in Amadalavasala to seek governments financial assistance to clear debts and create a fund for the revival of the lone agro-based industry in Srikakulam district.Sold to private firmThe cooperative sugar factory was sold to a private company in 2003 for Rs. 8 crore after it reported an accumulated loss of Rs. 30 crore. However, the local farmers approached the court claiming that the government had no right to sell the property to a private company since it was constructed with the share capital of farmers. Recently, the High Court had given a ruling in favour of the farmers. While the farmers and local public representatives hoped that the government would take steps for the revival of the cooperative unit, the government indicated plans for establishment of multi-purpose industries in the 70 acres by handing it over to the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC).Farmers reluctant: TD leaderReacting to the development, Amadalavalasa local MLA and whip Kuna Ravikumar told The Hindu that the farmers were against the establishment of other industries in the land.We will meet Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu again to explain the local peoples feelings and the benefits that would accrue with the agro-based industries in the district. I hope the government would revive the factory to stimulate economic activity while at the same time benefit the sugarecane growers, he said.Opposition demandFormer Minister Tammineni Sitharam challenged the government to a public debate over the issue, alleging that the then TDP government was instrumental for the closure of the factory. The government appointed a Cabinet committee in 2003 when the sugar factory reported huge losses. As a member of the committee, I opposed its closure. Now it is time for its revival, he added.PCC State spokesperson Ratnala Narasimha Murthy alleged that the government wanted to benefit industrialists instead of local farmers and workers.Amadalavalasa sugar factory is the lone agro-based company in the district and the government should provide financial assistance for its reopening since it has been the dream of many people. It can benefit farmers in 15 mandals of the district, he added.Leaders of the YSRC, Lok Satta and representatives of farmers associations have organised several meetings over the issue recently.Blaming the governments policy for losses and closure of the unit, they felt that an agitational programme should be undertaken cutting across party lines for the revival of the factory."

""Sugarcane production has dwindled across the country over the past two years for various reasons but it has been phenomenal in Karnataka considering the state is the third-largest producer of sugar in the country,'' said a senior officer of Cane Development and Director of Sugar, the state government body which monitors sugar production.Ahead of the kharif season, sugarcane farmers of Belagavi and Mandya districts hit the headlines by declaring a crop holiday. They felt it was better to be out of work than end up with heavy losses by cultivating Sugarcane. Soon, farmers from Bagalkot and some parts of Mysuru districts followed suit and stopped cultivating sugarcaneWhile farmers' leaders and state sugarcane growers' association claim farmers are abandoning sugarcane cultivation due to increase in cost of cultivation and decrease in profits, experts at the University of Agricultural Sciences contend the shortfall is due to decreasing water source, which the crop needs in abundance, especially in the Cauvery and Krishna catchment areas where the crop is largely grown. Though Mandya is described as the sugar bowl of Karnataka, the district lost this status in the recent years to Belagavi. Today, Mandya has only five sugar factories, whereas Belagavi has 20 of the 58 factories in the state. Belagavi is followed by Bagalkot district which has nine factories.According to official sources, t he government will lose a revenue of over Rs 5,000 crore from various products, such as sugar, molasses and spirit, produced by these factories. State sugarcane growers' association president Kurbur Shantakumar said, ""The decline in sugarcane production is no longer profitable because of reduced rainfall and government's failure to ensure timely payment. Despite protests over the past two years, government and sugar factories owe farmers about Rs 460 crore.""Moreover, while the market price of sugar is around Rs 4,000 per tonne, farmers hardly get between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,300 per tonne of sugarcane they produce. What's worse, farmers get their money after months and years of supplying the produce."

State Cooperation Minister Manish Kumar Grover was also present during the review process.The chief minister further suggested that all cooperative institutions should financially support each other, if required, rather than putting additional burden on public exchequer.Concerted efforts were being made to ensure that all cooperative institutions run in profit. Involvement of professionals and experts of cooperative sector could immensely help in achieving this goal, Khattar said, according to an official release.The CM also directed to replace machinery and equipment of cooperative sugar mills operating for the last over 40 years and said that their capacity should also be increased.Further, he suggested that services of specialists like Dr. Bakshi Ram Yadav, who had served Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Karnal, could be sought to develop new variety of sugarcane to increase its productivity.Also, the sugar mills should set up co-generation plants, he said.It was informed at the meeting that Haryana State Cooperative Supply and Marketing Federation (HAFED) has earned net profit of Rs. 38.06 crore for the financial year 2015-16 whereas Haryana State Cooperative Apex Bank Ltd gained a profit of Rs. 23 crore. - PTI"

This compares quite favourably with the Rs. 240 and Rs. 290 for the two varieties respectively at the beginning of 2015-16 season.The 2015-16 season turned out to be quite good for the market. It received 30 lakh lumps (each of 15 kg) i.e., 45,000 tonnes of jaggery during the season.The black quality began to be bought at Rs. 220 and moved up to Rs. 270 and the deluxe from Rs. 270 to Rs. 320 during the season. Traders stocked about 13,000 tonnes from January to April, say market sources.When demand rose they started offloading beginning at Rs. 290 for the black variety and it shot up to Rs. 360. The best quality had begun at Rs. 330 and ended at a high of Rs. 450, according to market sources.What resulted in considerable improvement in the rate for the stocks enabling us to offload the inventory was the crop failure in Maharashtra, analyses prominent trader Korukonda Butchiraju of Anakapalle.Said to be the second largest jaggery market in the country, the Anakapalle market has a a turnover of more than Rs. 110 crore.Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are major sugarcane producing States and failure in the latter has also resulted in spurt in sugar price, he points out.The price for a quintal of sugar that was more than Rs. 2,000 jumped to around Rs. 3,700 in 2015-16 season, he said."

The dues from the 28 mills on account of failure to settle SAP has accumulated to the extent of Rs. 1,000 crores over the last three years, K.V.

We will need to wait and watch,"" Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala said.Sales growth from most consumer-product companies over the past two years suggest that many are grappling with choppy demand, especially in rural markets, local competition and an unfavourable monsoon. Last year's monsoon was the worst in six years with a rain shortfall of 14%. Bad weather also damaged crops.""Our discussions with corporates as well as distributors indicate no meaningful uptick in consumer spending in the second quarter. But companies are optimistic about the second half of the year in view of normal monsoon after two consecutive years of drought and increased government spending on infrastructure and salaries. We expect the benefits of increased rural demand to start reflecting post-harvest towards the end of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of FY17,"" said Arnab Vora, analyst at BNP Paribas Price changes were limited and promotional intensity remained high in select categories such as shampoos, biscuits, soft drinks, hair oils and toothpaste. However, it has come down in soaps and detergents over past few months. ""We expect demand to be primarily volume-led rather than based on value. There has been an accelerated focus on promotions and value offers across the sector,"" PepsiCo India chairman DShivakumar, said.A report last week by researcher Nielsen forecast consumption revival in soft drinks in the festive quarter riding on the back of aggressive pricing, volume-led growth and newer channels of distribution including e-commerce, overtaking growth in the peak summer months.The industry, led by PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, has been seeing single digit growth for the past six quarters at least. Analysts said they expect aggregate volume growth to slip further in September quarter to roughly 3% compared to 4-5% in the June quarter.At the same time, margin expansion will be much lower as the base had benefits such as lower crude prices. Over the last three years, several companies have aggressively discounted and slashed prices in an effort to win shoppers, especially the ones that have slowed down spends in discretionary daily items.Prices of key raw materials such as wheat, sugar and palm oil, though low, have been gradually rising, which could impact profitability if promotions continue.For instance, input costs such as palm oil has increased 17% while sugar and wheat prices are up 59% and 14% each, respectively, over a year ago period. ""FMCG revenue growth will likely remain steady as there will be some pick-up in price growth which will compensate for lower volumes. The price offers in soaps are being pulled back while price hikes in personal care are underway,"" according to Arnab Mitra and Rohit Kadam of Credit Suisse. Experts also feel consumer companies will need resurgence in volume growth or pricing growth to meet market expectations of double-digit domestic business earnings growth.""Volume growth trends, government stimuli in rural India, pricing power amidst increases in commodity costs and consumer promotion intensity will be drivers for stock performance,"" said a recent report by Morgan Stanley that last month downgraded the Indian consumer sector expecting weaker revenue and profit growth at a time when the industry grew about 4% last year, the lowest in 13 years."

The device, which is presently used by a Karnataka-based dairy is similar to a sugar monitoring device which will display the purity of milk put into it.""The quality of milk can be reflected by the colour of the milk sample put on the plate. If the colour remains white, it will indicate total purity while if it changes to red or blue, it will determine presence of acidic or alkaline solvents in the milk,"" said dairy development minister Mahadev Jankar , who announced his plans to develop the gadget at a function in Thane on Saturday.Presently, the Food and Drug Administration has the authority to conduct raids and ascertain purity of milk but the board has plans to seek amendments to the same following a presentation to the chief minister soon. Once an approval is sought, the device will be given to the Maharashtra dairy development department on a trial basis to randomly check quality of milk and then made public.""Once the device is easily available for the public, the common man can easily be a catalyst to weed out milk adulteration from the state as adulterators will think twice about contaminating the milk,"" he said. The gadget will roughly cost between Rs 35-50 and the dairy development board will initially use it for internal purpose and later work on making it public, said an official.Meanwhile, around 50 dairy farmers from western Maharashtra, including Sangli and Kolhapur latched on to the weekly 'direct to consumer' concept in Thane.Around 800 litres of special Kolhapur milk was brought for sale at the weekly market at Gaondevi and was immediately sold out as the product was cheaper by Rs 5 per litre as compared to that available in the market."

Excerpts:When (MNS leader) Raj Thackeray brought up this topic of Rs 5 crore (donation to the Army Welfare Fund) during the meeting, I told the Film Producers Guild clearly that I am opposed to it and that you don't need to accept it. We had no issues over the other two conditions (about Pak artistes being banned from future movie projects and showing a slide paying tribute to soldiers before the screening of the film). I told them in front of Raj that the contribution has to be voluntary and upon how much patriotism you feel. I clearly told them that you need not pay this amount. However, the producers themselves were keen on it and said that they wanted to pay.See, the guild wanted me to intervene; it was not my decision to call Raj Thackeray for a meeting. When there was a need for action we did it, we had arrested 12 of their cadres (who barged in to a South Mumbai theatre). However, when there is a possibility of the issue being ended by talks then it should happen, this is the essence of democracy.The Jalyukt Shivar project to conserve water is the biggest project. Our state was in drought for years consecutively. For the first time we have turned this in to a people's movement. The other major initiative we have taken is that we were always lagging in education  our rank was 13th to 16th as per the Economic Survey. The learning outcome has been dismal as 60% of 5th standard students could not read the books of the third standard. So we have focused on learning outcomes. Today, in 17,000 schools the learning outcome is 100%. 15,000 students from private English medium schools have migrated to government-run schools this year.What we are planning is to bring the agricultural feeders on the solar network. We are making two pilot projects. Earlier we used to give farmers electricity in the morning and in the evening. This electricity was also heavily subidised by charging more from industries. If we convert our agricultural feeders into solar network, we would be able to supply cheaper power to the farmers and also curb transmission losses. The other major initiative that we are going to undertake is to bring in a scheme for sensor-based drip irrigation. We would be approaching sugar factories asking them to take a loan to provide money to sugarcane farmers to install sensorbased drip irrigation as it leads to better yield with less wastage of water. Those factories that don't participate in this will not be eligible for any of the state schemes.The WB cannot put any conditions on us that the situation doesn't exist anymore. Now we put the conditions (on them), everybody is coming to give us money. Take the example of the Nagpur-Mumbai Communication Expressway, this would change the future of the state. When it is completed our state would be 20 years ahead of the rest of the country. Twenty-four districts would be integrated with Mumbai. In 10 hours you will be able to reach Mumbai from anywhere. In 16 hours maximum a container would be able to reach JNPT. The petroleum ministry has agreed to lay four pipelines below this road, one will carry gas, one will carry petrol and one will carry petrochemicals. Imagine a stretch of 800 KMs  an entire industrial stretch would come up. The reason the electronics industry has not been able to set up in India is, to sustain, the industry needs gas and with this project this will open up both Mumbai and Nagpur for gasbased industries.We are not monetising land, we will just securitise it, we are just showing our worth, we are going to start a holding company where we will show all our assets and we will get loan accordingly. For instance, for the Nagpur-Mumbai expressway, we have got Rs 34,000 crore from private sector banks and ADB after we told that the land we have is worth Rs 50,000 crore. Similarly, we are also retiring our costly loans. For instance, from the energy department, we had loans taken at 11.5%. We have now brought it down to 8.50%. This will result in annual savings of Rs 800 crore.The kind of protests that the Marathas are taking out is something that we cannot criticise because this is ideal in democracy. By launching a peaceful protest they are piling on pressure on the state and we are acting on it. If there was violence in the morchas, then I don't think there would be any pressure on us. There are legacy issues but the issue could be resolved, the two communities should not stand against each other but should work together ... The Dalits should not think that every other community is coming together to bring down their security. We have to ensure that this feeling should not be allowed to develop. Most of the Maratha community leaders want to resolve the issue. Only a few want to exploit it for political gains.None of the organisers of the morcha is interested (in that). However, there are some among the political parties who are interested in a leadership change through the movement.I said that I won't be a lame duck CM even for a single day. I won't sit in the chair for enjoying it, I want to lead the state to progress. You can write it down that I would be the chief minister for the complete five years.We want him to come back.We had formed a committee to look into the issue. The committee found that the agreement with the toll operators was so lopsided and in favour of the contractor that if we cancel the contract, the contractor would benefit immensely. It's a matter of surprise as to how the contracts were executed by the previous governments. Even the irrigation contracts are the same, hence we cancelled many of the contracts in the Gosikhurd project as the tenders were given at double the normal rates."

A formal announcement in this regard is expected from chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai on Wednesday.However, it will be a tough task for the BJP leaders to keep all the alliance partners in tandem. Raju Shetti's Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana , which has been with the BJP since 2014, has been a strong opponent of the Jansurajya Party. Both Shetti and Kore have stood against each other at many platforms, especially during the agitations of farmers.District guardian minister Chandrakant Patil said, ""We have formally completed the discussions with Kore and he will soon be part of the ruling BJP alliance. His party will be the sixth, including the BJP, to be a part of the ruling state government. Kore will meet Fadnavis in Mumbai on Wednesday morning, where the formal announcement will be done in the presence of senior BJP leaders.""He added, ""Adding Kore and his party to our list of friends will make BJP powerful in south Maharashtra, including Kolhapur, Sangli and Solapur. Jansurajya Party members will be now part of BJP alliance and our first test of unity will be the local body elections in the state. BJP will help Jansurajya party and vice versa during the forthcoming municipal council elections in the districts.""Shetti and Kore are traditional rivals and Shetti's party has always targeted Kore and his sugar factory during farmers agitation. Kore has never heeded to the pressure of agitations of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana for sugarcane price.Just last week, members of SSS set a truck carrying sugarcane crop to Kore's Warana co-operative sugar mill on fire alleging that the factory should not start sugar cane crushing without paying last year's arrears to the farmers.The Jansurajya Party joining the BJP coalition will also change political equations in the district. Vinay Kore had formed alliance with NCP during the Kolhapur Municipal Corporations election, Kolhapur District Central Co-operative bank and Agricultural Producers Market Committee elections. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana had formed alliance with Congress at ZP elections and was in power there."

He urged finance minister O Panneerselvam to invite the farmers and representatives of farmers' associations for talks.Stalin said that farmers informed him that the state government owed Rs 350 crore to cooperative sugar mills and Rs 1,650 crore to private sugar factories. He said the farmers were staging protests often, as the AIADMK government had not taken action to settle the arrears since it came to power.He added that in the world market, the price of sugar had increased to Rs 38,000 a tonne, yet private sugarcane mills were not settling farmers' dues.Stalin quoted farmers as saying that they were unable to repay their farm loans, and the jewels they had pawned for repaying the loans could not be retrieved.

Rural India recorded a higher retail inflation at 6.7% as against 5.4% in urban areas.Separate data released by CSO showed industrial output growth rose an annual 2.1% in June, up from 1.1% in the previous month and 4.2% in June last year. During April-June, industrial output growth rose 0.6% compared to a rise of 3.3% in the same period last year. Retail food prices soared 8.4% in July compared with the previous month's 7.8% rise. Prices of pulses remained stubborn, rising 27.5%, while eggs prices grew 9.3% year-on-year. Vegetable prices rose 14%, while sugar and confectionary rose 21.9%.The government has retained the inflation target of 4% (plus/minus 2%) for the next five years as it set the process to nominate government members on the proposed monetary policy committee (MPC), which will decide on interest rates in the months ahead.Rajan left interest rates unchanged in his latest monetary policy earlier this month but flagged the risks of inflation. Economists expect food prices to moderate as supplies improve but hopes of a cut in interest rates have receded for now. Above average monsoon rains are expected to trigger robust harvest and help moderate food prices. ""We expect CPI inflation to trend downwards in the next few months, and print in the range of 4.5-5.5% in the remainder of 2016,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ratings agency ICRA. She expects the central bank to cut interest rates by another 25 basis points in the remainder of 2016, irrespective of the composition of the MPC.""With some uncertainty regarding the final structure of the goods and services tax (GST) rates and their impact on inflation, it is difficult to gauge the extent to which the MPC may cut the repo rate in 2017, given the likely transition towards the mid-point of the inflation target band from the interim target of 5% in March 2017,"" said Nayar."

From the last two years, farmers were suffering losses and we will not bear it this year.""He added that the fair and renumerative price has not changed from last two years and sugar factories can pay the price they are seeking. It has been Rs 2,300 per tonne for 9.5% recovery, but the production cost, prices of fertilizers and other costs including power and labour has increased enormously. Only if farmers get Rs 3,200 per tonne, they will be able to earn some profit, he said.In the past, Shetti has taken on sugar barons over the sugarcane prices. The agitations of his Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana have even taken violent turn. However, he has faced allegations of mellowing his stand ever since he supported the BJP-led state government.Refuting the allegations, he had said that he was set to start the agitation again. ""It is the duty of sugar barons to accept our demands or we will take to the streets and not allow a single piece of sugarcane crop to be cut till our demands are met,"" he said."

But every so often there comes a study or research that turns conventional wisdom on its head and everything you knew to be heart-unfriendly, in a heartbeat, is stripped of its status as a villain. Egg yolk  can't be so bad for the heart; exercise, well don't get worked up about it, your heart will do as fine a job of beating without all that huffing and lifting; fat can't be so bad, otherwise the porcine population would have been decimated. And so the list of studies debunking theories that we've held on to as the gospel truth keeps surfacing with alarming regularity. And, you wonder if you should also, accordingly, be revising and reviewing your cardiac care strategy with every new counter study..Sorry, guys, if this comes as a heart-break of sorts, but before you ditch the exercise and diet plan, listen to what a few well-known heart specialists from the city have to say about conventional wisdom in matters of heart. Take heart from it, we say, and keep 'em ticking and pumping as healthy hearts are wont to...There's no argument about it that a high-carbohydrate diet results in extra calories, which causes obesity; can lead to early diabetes, and the extra calories get deposited in the body as fat. When it comes to salt, it has been seen that simple salt restriction and lifestyle modification are often enough to control BP, and reduce the load on the heart. A low-salt diet always works. People in Tamil Nadu consume a lot of rice and it's advisable they cut down on carbs and increase protein intake. For one meal, they can opt for wheat and wheat products like chappatis, upma, and dalia. Fat should be taken in moderation, but not egg yolk, red meat and meat fat. White meat like fish, chicken, and white of egg are safe fats. We will do ourselves a world of good by going for one serving of fresh fruits and salad every day. Fresh fruits are rich in antioxidants. Those who drink alcohol should drink in moderation. Whatever people eat, they should keep a close watch on their calorie intake. Keeping one's weight under control and exercising every day will definitely help in keeping the heart healthy. These days many youngsters are getting heart attacks, and it's important for the 20-30 age-group to keep a close watch on their weight and play some game regularly. Smoking is strictly prohibited if you want to keep your heart healthy. It is harmful for the lungs, for the heart, causes cancer and vascular damage. Finally, it's nice to see that so many people in our city are taking time off for their walks.The basic thing here is that one should not go by one study or survey alone. What is the majority opinion  the one that all the leading doctors across the world go by? What is the unanimous agreement in the field of medicine as far as heart ailments go these days? There are three points here. One, diabetes and hypertension are the two major killers of the heart, and no one disputes this. So, one must cut down on the intake of sugar and go for a balanced diet, something that contains 30% carbs, 20% fat, 30% protein, vitamins, etc. Two, cut the carbs, and salt intake. At present, we Indians, and especially down south, we consume far too much rice and wheat, as well as grains. Prudence suggests that we reorient our dietary patterns, and prudence also suggests we reduce the intake of salt to the bare essentials. All these appalam, pappadam, pickles we eat  these were included at a time when our forefathers used to work in the sun, and the sodium content in these foods were needed to sweat it out. But you and I don't sweat at all, and this leads to sodium accumulation. So, we must keep our salt intake to about 5gm per day. And even for carbs, go for ones low on the glycemic index. And, three, exercise. It has been unanimously agreed that the human body needs exercise right from birth till death. So, light exercise every day, all days, is a must.Most of these studies that contradict conventional studies are without basis and they are not even clinically proven. The Chennai diet has more of carbohydrates. The south Indian diet  idli, dosa, puri  everything is loaded with fat and carbs. Consumption of carbs should be reduced. Smoking is a major risk factor. Salt consumption should be reduced. One does not need to totally avoid salt. Even if you are hypertensive, a daily intake of 3-5gm of salt should be fine. Be careful not to add extra salt to your diet, like adding salt to curd rice. Avoid pickles and the famous gun powder.Chicken, fish and egg white are OK. Avoid egg yolks because they have been proven to have a high levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. Mutton, prawns, crabs, squids have high cholesterol.Chennai is polluted, but pollution per se does not affect the heart. If there are lung and respiratory problems, it can affect the heart adversely by putting pressure on it. Try to avoid a smoke-filled environment, and never allow yourself to become a passive smoker."

58f69d4f7be9e031f13b8a7f,"Running helps lose weight, strengthen muscles",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Running-helps-lose-weight-strengthen-muscles/articleshow/53836241.cms,2016-08-24,"Visakhapatnam: Jogging, running and brisk walking are the commonest physical activities sighted at any park, health arena or roads during early mornings and sometimes in the evenings. To burn those extra calories and stay fit, running and jogging are the easiest and quickest forms of physical exercise. But, if you are running for fitness, there are several dos and don'ts to burn maximum calories within 20 to 30 minutes.Running, jogging and walking are forms of aerobic exercises of various degrees of intensity. Jogging requires more muscle than walking and can be done by anyone, whereas running requires more effort and is more intense than jogging. These aerobic exercises help the body lose weight and make general improvements in one's health. Jogging and running both help the body shed calories and so eventually help reduce weight. At the same time, they help to strengthen the leg muscles, abdominal muscles and the cardiovascular system. Jogging prevents muscle and bone loss that often occurs with age. Both jogging and running benefit the human body as a whole.Health benefits of running are numerous. According to experts, running burns calories while one is working out. Regular running also increases bone mass and even helps stem age-related bone loss. Running enhances the mood by triggering a rush of feel-good hormones. Just 30 minutes of running five times a week can boost the quality of sleep and concentration during the day. Regular running helps defeat age-related mental decline, particularly functions such as task switching, selective attention and working memory. It guards against obesity and decreases risk of several obesity-associated ailments. Running adds years to life. Even if one meets just the minimum amount of physical activity -- 30 minutes, five times per week --one tends to live longer.There's usually two groups of runners or joggers - those who run on the road or jogging tracks in the parks or in any open air environment and those who run on the treadmill in gymnasiums. As per experts, running outdoors in fresh air and in natural environment is definitely better than running in the closed environs of an air-conditioned gym.Elaborating on this difference, Eastern Naval Command's sports officer captain Animesh Nagar said, ""If treadmills aren't cleaned after use by each runner, the sweat left on them makes it highly unhygienic for other users. Treadmill is also assisted running and increases heart rate without adequately tiring the muscles and this may lead to undue strain on the heart. Further, there are bio-mechanical and psychological differences between running on the treadmill and running on the tracks or streets. The treadmill has a uniform level and soft floor. But when running outdoors, the surface is a mixture of stones, soft and hard surfaces, wet or dry points, and combinations of all these. Running on to these surfaces is a challenge, which enhances the perception or the ability of the neuro-muscular system to recognise the impact on different types of muscles, joints and other members of the body. This is important for runners because it affects the balance, strength and economy of running. Running on the treadmill eliminates this important aspect.""Speaking on the other aspects of running the right way, captain Nagar said, ""Taking the individual's weight into consideration, the ideal speed of running for an overall healthy adult depends on their comfort level. It can be improved with consistent training. For best aerobic exercise benefits, the heart rate while running should be about 130 to 140 per minute. The more the age, the lesser heart rate should be maintained to garner maximum benefits. When the heart rate is within this zone, the body primarily uses fat for energy while at higher heart rates, sugar is used for energy thus reducing the long term effects of the exercise. For optimum benefits, 150 minutes of run in a week that is 30 minutes running five times a week is ideal. Initially, while taking up the exercise, 10 minutes of running and 10 minutes of jogging is good. The duration may be increased as the body adapts to the exercise. However, if the person is obese or a cardiac patient, they must consult a doctor before getting into the running regime. Obese people are benefited from running or jogging. They can start with short runs/jogs and keep their doctors informed.""As for the dos and don'ts for running, one must keep themselves hydrated by sipping water. Hydrate oneself well before and during the run. ""Water is the best drink, avoid high carbohydrate drinks such as juices. In fact avoid anything which is pre-packed. Whole fruits are much beneficial than juices which are devoid of many photo nutrients and fibre. Ideally, one must avoid any heavy meal about two hours before the run. But a walk after dinner is recommended. Post run, one can consume a banana or any other fruit within 15 minutes of the completion of the run. If the duration of the run is more than 30 minutes, then drink water during the run as well. For each hour of run, at least 500 ml of water must be consumed. When getting initiated into running, one should not try to overachieve in the beginning. Running and jogging can be combined by alternatively speeding up and slowing down every few minutes,"" advised captain Nagar.-- Running and jogging are effective aerobic exercises with numerous health benefits-- Besides weight loss, they help strengthen the muscles and cardiovascular system-- Run for a total of about 150 minutes for at least five times a week - that is about 30 minutes daily for five days-- Running in open air outside is better than running in the air-conditioned indoors of a gym-- Obese and cardiac people should consult doctors before initiating their running regime-- Keep the body hydrated by sipping little water (not fruit juice) during and before running"
