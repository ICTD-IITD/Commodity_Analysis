After BJP leadership accused the SP government of not implementing the scheme in time, it is now protesting against the inclusion of sugarcane farmers in the insurance scheme. Since sugarcane is an almost risk-free crop, farmers are not willing to take it and pay premium. But the state government has made it mandatory for all farmers. It's now backfiring on BJP as farmers believe it is a Central scheme.The Centre has written twice to SP government suggesting not to include sugarcane farmers under the scheme, but there has been no response. Now, BJP is planning to protest against the state government at district level, especially in western UP which is deemed the sugar bowl of UP.On the other hand, farmers are worried that by the time the sugarcane crop is harvested, they are already under pressure as there is always a delay in getting their dues. If they have to pay a compulsory premium of 5% on the total cost of the crop, it would be a financial burden on them. Since the scheme for farmers in general was publicised by the Centre and BJP leadership on every platform, sugarcane farmers are holding them responsible for the problem, said BJP's national Kisan Morcha president Vijaypal Singh Tomar, while speaking to TOI.Union minister for agriculture Radha Mohan Singh has written to the UP Chief Minister to reconsider the decision stating that sugarcane is a risk-free crop and doesn't need insurance. The letter written by the minister on September 1 also refers to another written by Central Agricultural Department 's joint secretary to UP's principal secretary, agricultural in this regard. A reply to the letter is awaited, said the BJP farmer leader.UP Agriculture Minister Vinod Singh alias 'Pandit Singh' said that sugarcane has been given insurance cover keeping in mind flood-like situation in various districts in the state. ""We have stated this in response to Union Minister Radha Mohan Singh 's letter,"" said Pandit Singh , adding that otherwise too, 50% of the premium was being paid by Centre and rest by state government."

On the other hand, PM Narendra Modi has increased compensation to farmers from Rs 9,000 to Rs 13,500 per hectare"", he said.Sonkar alleged that around Rs 12,000 crore sanctioned by the Centre to the state government to be distributed among farmers has not reached the beneficiaries.CM Akhilesh Yadav should give the accounts of this amount, he added. He said though Akhilesh government had declared 2015 as a year of the farmers, but it was just an eyewash as his government has done nothing for the poor farmers.""On PM Narendra Modi's initiative, for the first time, urea price has been reduced, and at present the cost of DAP urea is Rs 125 less per bag"", he claimed.He announced that BJP, if came to power in UP, would start several welfare schemes in the state which include one free cow to each BPL card holder, 24-hour power supply, implementation of Bima Fasal Yojana etc."

But on Tuesday, a number of motorists were in for a surprise as they got roses and chocolates from the traffic personnel.As part of the Road Safety Week celebrations, the traffic police embarked on an innovative method to create awareness on the importance of wearing helmets. They presented roses to motorists, who wore helmets, and those who did not, received chocolates near Anna Kalaiarangam junction on Anna Salai.We presented the roses to motorists wearing helmets as a way of appreciating them in following the rules. We gave chocolates to those who did not wear helmets and asked them to certainly wear one from tomorrow. We told them the importance of wearing helmets to prevent head injury and saving lives, R. Seetharaman, Inspector, Traffic, said.As part of the celebrations, the traffic police along with JCI stuck black stickers on the headlights of vehicles. The glare from the headlights hinders vision of road users coming in the opposite direction at night hours. We stuck more than 1,000 black stickers on vehicles, including on buses, at the Green Circle junction and Makkan junction, he added.The traffic police had also organised a free medical camp for drivers of autos, vans and buses at the New Bus Stand on Monday. The drivers underwent eye screening and were checked for their sugar levels to determine if they were diabetic, he said."

Going by the recommendation of M.S. Swaminathan Commission recommendation advocating a procurement price calculated on the basis of cost of production plus 50 per cent, Rs. 4,000 ought to be paid by the mills per tonne, the farmers said.They called upon the State Governemnt to secure the Rs. 2,850 per tonne promised this year unfailingly from the mills, and at the same time, urged the authorities to waive tax on sugar and alcohol, besides evacuating power from the cogeneration units on a regular basis.Farmers said the mills were facing the ignominy of paying fines even after deciding to supply power to the grid without getting any returns, the farmers said.DelegationThe delegation comprised representatives of Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Growers Association, Tamil Nadu Swadeshi Farmers Association, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam (Narayanasamy Naidu), Thadapalli-Arakankottai Paasana Vivasayigal Sangam, Kalingarayan Paasana Vivasayigal Sangam, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam (K.C.), Bannari Amman Sugar Mill Cane Farmers Association, Sakthi Mill Sugarcane Farmers Association, Pugazhur EID.

Police and anti-narcotic agencies have initiated drives to eradicate both cannabis and poppy from Kullu and that has posed a challenge for people in making some favourite cuisines.People of Kullu had been cultivating poppy to get its seeds used to prepare a variety of cuisines including famous Kullu siddu. But farmers have left poppy production since as the authorities imposed a ban on poppy, which can be used to produce opium, brown sugar and heroin. Police and agencies, which had arrested a large number of people for poppy cultivation in the last few years, have continued the anti-poppy drive.Kullu superintendent of police Padam Chand said police have destroyed poppy crop in various locations in Kullu this year and are committed to get rid of charas and opium from the entire district.Meanwhile, HP government would start a statewide 15-day cannabis destruction drive from August 22. Though the authorities know that plants of cannabis and poppy are used to cook local dishes and prepare many household items like ropes and slippers, their misuse by drug mafia has made them destroy the plantation altogether.""Everybody used to grow poppy plants to get its seeds which are edible. We use it to prepare siddu, parantha, femada and many other items. As police have taken strict action, everybody is afraid of cultivating poppy,"" said a farmer from Bhuntar. Police in the recent years have booked owners of private land where poppy plants were cultivated. Sources said that area under poppy cultivation in Kullu has gone down over the years.Another farmer from Barshaini village said, ""Now nobody cultivates poppy to get its seeds. I think some people are continuing its production only to prepare drugs. Honest people fear police action as it is very difficult to convince police that the crop is only to get edible seeds.""Czech Republic, Turkey, Hungry and Spain are the top producers of poppy seeds. The small seeds are used as condiment to prepare variety of sweet and salty cuisines. People in Kullu, where seeds are not available, have replaced poppy seeds by other items like nuts of peach and walnuts."

Ramana Cooperative Sugar Factory (Tummapala sugar factory) and are also worried that the healthy unit would be privatised.A large number of farmers and workers staged a dharna in front of the Collectorate here on Saturday demanding reopening of the factory as they feared that Sugarcane Commissioners meeting with MDs of sugar factories of four coastal districts scheduled to be held during the day would be the platform to decide on privatisation of the factory.This is one of the many agitations and programmes conducted by the farmers and employees after the overhauling work for 2015-16 season was completed and the factory is ready to undertake crushing of sugarcane. The CITU-affiliated Workers and Employees Union of the factory also submitted a memorandum to the Collector.Salaries not paidDistrict secretary of AP Koulu Rytu Sangham A. Balakrishna told The Hindu that a sum of Rs. 3 crore was due from the factory to the farmers for the sugarcane they supplied during the last season and 450 employees were without wages for the last 17 months. They are continuing with the factory with the hope that the factory would start functioning.There was no reason for not starting the crushing, Mr. Balakrishna said. One lakh tonne of sugarcane is ready for crushing in the area under the factory. The farmers are ready to supply cane to Tummapala factory as the jaggery is not tempting this time since its price has fallen. If the situation continues like this the farmers have to burn their crops, he said.Mr. Balakrishna said the Chandrababu Naidu government was planning to push the healthy sugar factory into the red and sell it to private parties."

""All our medical needs is met by the forest. We use naval (jamun) seeds to control blood sugar levels and thuthuvalai (purple fruited pea eggplant) to cure cough and cold in our children,"" said Rajamani. ""If not for the forest, we will have to depend on costly medicines from stores.""Farmers, actors and teachers from Thiruvannamalai all gathered outside the court, ready to explain how the government's plan would hit their livelihood. The plan is to widen the 14km girivalam path to accommodate more pilgrims during full moon nights - when the crowd is at its peak.Locals say 4km of the 14-km stretch is through ancient forests and should not be disturbed. ""There are six lakes in this 4km. They act like reservoirs and store water draining down from the mountains and sustain the ecology. The government wants to build a road over it and this will destroy everything,"" said K Murugan, who acted in the film 'Cuckoo'.Farmers say that when trees are cut an entire eco-system is lost. ""These are naturally formed forests and each tree has its own intricate eco-system. There are both migratory and indigenous birds that depend on these trees. Government officials do not understand the importance of this eco-system and are blindly axing trees,"" said writer Kumar Ambayeran.Last week, the Thiruvannamalai collector submitted a report to the southern bench of the NGT saying only 125 trees would be cut. Earlier, 847 trees were identified by the highways department, of which 347 were required to be cut. After an inspection, the number was reduced to 218. Finally, it was decided to cut only 125 non-valuable trees."

In 2015, the trade volume with China through Lipulekh pass was Rs 4.36 crore, of which Indian traders exported goods worth Rs 1.6 crore while imports from China were worth Rs 2.76 crore. In 2014, imports from the local Bhutia traders were worth Rs 2.14 crore while they sold goods worth just 1.9 crore. Indian exports from the district include mainly carpets, bamboo, matchboxes and packed sweets, while the traders bring back readymade garments, jackets and raw wool.""A total of 195 trade passes were issued this year, of which 77 were for traders and 118 were for helpers, but no Chinese traders came to the Indian mandi in Gunji,"" said P S Kutiyal, assistant trade officer. The final figures for this year's trade can be calculated only after all the traders reach the Gunji mandi and pay their customs duty, he added.The cross-border business takes place between June and October each year when traders make the journey across the 17,000-foot-high Lipulekh pass to Purang. The district administration had extended the trade time by a month after traders petitioned to the government, saying early closure will lead to financial losses. ""The trade for this year closed on October 31 as all the traders and helpers have come back from the Chinese mandi in Taklakot,"" said Kutiyal.Of late, the Chinese authorities have become stringent on border trade with India. The export of commodities like jaggery (gur) and mishri (sugar candy), which forms the backbone of the trade has seen a slump of almost 80%, said local traders.According to traders who have been involved in the export of gur and sugar candy commodities for several decades, the Chinese officials have been imposing 'unnecessary restrictions' on the trade activities in the region.""The Chinese officials have been discouraging the imports claiming that these two products carry no expiry date and are not packaged under hygienic conditions, so the Indian traders had to export packed sweets this year,"" said Krishna Garvuyal, one of the traders.Absence of a currency exchange in the region also added to the woes of the traders. The temporary branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) in Gunji has no facility of currency exchange. ""Absence of this facility makes the exchange rates costlier as traders have to pay Rs 11 for one Yuan, while the current rate is Rs 9.89 for a Yuan,"" said a trader.""We had submitted a memorandum to the central government and local trade officer to set up a currency exchange in SBI Gunji branch, but nothing has been done in this regard,"" said Garvuyal.Also the Chinese authorities do not allow transport animals like mules, horses or any other animals after the Lipulekh pass from where the Indian traders have to take Chinese vehicles to carry their goods. It makes the products costly as the fares are quite high, he said."

In the same period last year, Coca-Cola's sales in India grew by 4%.""The company needs to diversify into more categories here other than sugary carbonated beverages, as sales of soft drinks in India is following a different trajectory than in other markets,"" said Arvind Singhal, founder and chairman of retail consultancy Technopak. ""Coke's rival PepsiCo has done reasonably well by building a successful food business.""At present, fizzy drinks account for less than 25% of PepsiCo's global revenues. Earlier this month, PepsiCo's chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi unveiled ambitious plans to reduce the amount of sugar in its beverages, signalling a larger global trend that shows a slowdown in sales of sugar-sweetened beverages.In India, while Coca-Cola and PepsiCo control around 80% of the soft drink market, the carbonated category, (worth Rs 14,000 crore) consisting of colas and lemony drinks such as Pepsi and Sprite, accounts for more than 70% of the overall market, according to Nielsen. However, the widespread availability of health-based drinks such as packaged lassi, aam panna and soya milk among others have dented the growth of fizzy beverages in India. Coke re-entered the dairy category in January with its flavoured milk brand Vio.""While Indians in their thirties and above are shifting to healthier beverages, children are still consuming soft drinks,"" said nutritionist and author Pooja Makhija. ""However, as they are well-exposed to what's happening around them, they will also realize the health concerns of consuming colas soon.""Apart from a growing negative perception of sweetened beverages, increased taxation of sugary drinks in many markets, including India, have led beverage companies to pass on the extra cost to consumers, making their products dearer in price-sensitive markets."

And that's not all. Being the third largest consumer of coal, India is also the third highest producer of black carbon emissions in the world, experts added.So what should be done to bring down this carbon emission from Indian households. Ask the experts and comes the prompt reply. ""To economise and utilise more efficient solutions, the use of methanol should be encouraged over fossil fuel in domestics as well as industry set-ups,"" they said.""Methanol produces no smoke or soot when burnt and reduces health damage which ordinary cooking stoves can cause. It can also eliminate the dependence on petroleum products and natural gas,"" said Harry Stokes of US-based non-profit Project Gaia, while presenting a Methanol-fuelled stove on Friday. He was speaking at a lecture series on 'Methanol Economy for India' in the city.""India is the third highest emitter of black carbon in the world.

""India produces 1 billion tonnes of non-edible biomass, including the large amount of sugarcane husk (bagasse) which is left over after sugar production in Maharashtra. This husk can be used to produce methanol which would cost about Rs 18 per litre,"" Prakash said.During his inaugural address Niti Ayog member VK Saraswat spoke about the uses of methanol in India. ""Cellphone towers use a significant amount of the total diesel consumption of the country. If we can switch these to methanol, it will not only greatly reduce the country's emissions, but also cut down on fossil fuel usage. Additionally, it can also be used to fuel existing vehicles with a low-cost conversion, the easiest of which will be two-stroke engines,"" he said.To promote use of this eco and pocket-friendly fuel, domestic use is a good starting point. ""There is much misconception about methanol and alcohol fuels. When people start using it at their homes, these misconceptions will gradually subside,"" Stokes said.The stove has been developed by Clean Cook Sweden AB CEO TED Orbrink and costs about $20 (approximately Rs 1,300).

A rich symphony of flavour, texture and spice, this repast will leave your table looking like a 'sufachat maidan'!Weddings or family celebrations; this sweet is specially prepared on auspicious occasions. Traditionally served with sweet curd (or mithoo dahi), the roasted vermicelli and dry fruits conjure up some magic in the presence of pure ghee. We particularly love the version available at Rustom Restaurant, MG Road, where it will feature as part of a larger New Year menu.Crisp outside and succulent within, the dish epitomises Parsis' love for all things eggy and meaty. Marinated in the goodness of chillies, garlic and garam masala, the tenderly-spiced chicken, balanced out by its lacy egg coating, is a story to experience with all your senses. Most Parsi joints serve this deep-fried delicacy, but we recommend sampling it at The Food Gallery, Lullanagar.A favourite at navjotes, fresh pomfret is smeared in rich green chutney and wrapped in banana leaves. The little parcels that are steamed to perfection are a poetic confluence of flavours. You must try this one at Dorabjees & Sons in Camp, where they bake the fish before steaming it to retain the firmness outside and succulence within.Hailing from the Persian scullery, this rich onion-tomato gravy of juicy prawns is a patent preparation especially during weddings. Served with maura dal chawal, most Parsis will have fond memories of their mamaijis preparing this comforting meal from a recipe passed down in the family.

""Such a margin is quite high if one looks for correct diagnosis and correct line of treatment"", said the NPL director.Currently, the NPL of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) - country's premier national R&D body - provides apex calibration of equipments to various industries, strategic, academia and government agencies."

Later, addressing the reporters Kore said that he had joined hands with the BJP-led government to ensure rural development of Maharashtra and bring the Jan Surajya dream alive.""I have formed an alliance with the BJP and its associated parties to ensure that the state government takes steps for development of rural part of Maharashtra. It is essential that the new schemes announced by the central government for the development of villages should be effectively implemented. The benefits of these schemes should reach all parts of the rural Maharashtra,"" he said.He added, ""I discussed with chief minister about this and he has agreed to work on it. Along with this there are number of issues on which we have raised objections, including Central government policies towards co-operative sector and sugar factories. I registered an objection to include sugar in essential commodities segment and have demanded that government should deregularise sugar prices. We hope that government will look into these matters soon.""Kore is the third major personality from Kolhapur district that BJP has succeeded to rope in into the party after Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati and Samrjeetsinh Ghatage.

According to leadership guru Steven Denning, the life expectancy rate of Fortune-500 companies has reduced from around 75 years in the 1950s to less than 15 years now. Defying this average, a list of Indian companies have been in existence for over 100 years  and several of them are still going strong.Year of Inception 1879 Headquarters Mumbai Promoters Public shareholders and Nusli Wadia FamilyBombay Dyeing Company turned to textile only after it started suffering huge losses in its dyeing business in the early 1900s. This was around the time when Indian cloth merchants stopped importing cloth from Chinese manufacturers.""It can therefore be surmised, Bombay Dyeing flourished along with the domestic textile industry in Bombay,"" says corporate historian Raman Mahadevan.The company has managed to stay afloat over 100 years, despite competition, cut-throat price wars and emergence of low-cost upcountry manufacturing centres across the country.""The company's ability to innovate and modernise continuously has helped it survive long,"" Raman Mahadevan adds.However, Bombay Dyeing has not been a great performer - in terms of corporate earnings - over the past few years. The company's profit margins have shrunk significantly since 2013-14. In the last financial year, Bombay Dyeing suffered a loss of Rs 85.24 crore. The company management blames economic sluggishness as one of the reasons for the poor show.Bombay Dyeing's real estate vertical - Bombay Realty - has had problems securing clearances for its residential projects. The textile division is facing headwinds from cheaper substitutes manufactured by the unorganised sector. Bombay Dyeing's polyester division was dogged by falling crude prices and the resultant drop in polyester prices.In the near future, the company intends to outsource textile manufacturing to reduce cost. Strengthening of the 'Bombay Dyeing' brand is also on the cards.Year of Inception 1902 Headquarters Gurgaon Promoters Public shareholders and Jindal familyShalimar is billed as the oldest paint company in South Asia. A clutch of government agencies such as Central Public Works Department, NTPC, Indian Railways, BPCL and IOC feature in its long list of loyal clients.""We have several institutional clients who have stayed with us for more than three generations,"" says Surender Bhatia, CEO of Shalimar Paints. ""A robust product range and a strong network of dealers and customers have helped us perform well all these years,"" he adds.The company has made rapid strides in the recent past, moving from ubiquitous distempers to emulsion paints, water-based colours, weatherproof paints and new-age decorative colours. Today Shalimar boasts of giving 55,000 colour options to its clients. The company recorded profit of Rs 5.2 crore on a sales turnover of Rs 403 crore last fiscal.""Consumer taste changes every 4-5 years. We try to keep pace with changing tastes. The company is also getting re-branded as we speak. The idea is to make Shalimar a modern company,"" says Bhatia.Year of Inception 1863 Headquarters Mumbai Promoter Public shareholders and Nusli Wadia FamilyBombay Burmah Trading Corporation (BBTC) was established in 1863 by Wallace & Company, a firm controlled by a Scottish family of six brothers based in London.According to Raman Mahadevan, a Bengaluru-based business historian, Wallace brothers set up their business in India with the help of a Parsi entrepreneur Framjee Nusserwanjee Patel. The company ventured into Rangoon subsequently, sighting good business prospects. It leased out large tracts of forest land in Burma and emerged a big teak exporter.""The assumption that the Wadias had assumed control over BBTC as early as 1913 seems to be misplaced. Even as late as the 1940s, the managing agents and secretaries of BBTC, as listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, is that of Wallace & Co,"" Mahadevan adds.In the early 1900s, BBTC diversified to raw cotton, textiles and oil as well. The Wadias seem to have picked shares of the company post 1930 - and tightened its grip on the company only in the post-Independence era.BBTC is currently engaged in plantations (tea and coffee), auto electric components, healthcare, real estate and weighing products businesses. The company recorded a loss of Rs 33.15 crore in the last financial year.Adverse weather conditions and increase in wages eroded earnings in the company's tea business. Slowdown in the auto industry and real estate verticals also hit the bottom line last year. The company has started taking measures to improve its earnings. It has started replanting tea bushes to improve yield; BBTC also intends to launch a retail brand of special tea in India.BBTC is also looking to unlock in its land parcel value over the next few years. The auto-parts and healthcare divisions too have plans to expand their products and service offerings.In India since 1892 Headquarters Mumbai Promoter United Technologies CorpAbout this time next year, Otis would have installed its fastest elevator in the country, ferrying passengers 2.5 metres every second  or about 500 feet per minute. This, in itself, is not a big achievement because Otis has set up speedier lifts elsewhere in the world. The company's elevators in Burj Khalifa - the world's tallest skyscraper - hurtle from ground level to 124th floor in 59 seconds - at 10 metres per second.""Up to 80 per cent of elevators installed in India move at speeds lesser than 1 metre per second. This has to improve, without compromising on safety of passenger or their comfort,"" says Sebi Joseph, managing director of Otis Elevator Company. ""We want to make smarter elevators that will meet the rising aspirations of our customers.""Otis started actual production some six decades ago. The company has a manufacturing plant in Bengaluru, which produces 10,000 units every year. Otis has 2,600 employees in India.""Our order book is growing 20 per cent every year. We've invested heavily in technology and research. Our strategy is to make quality elevators available at all price points,"" says Joseph.Year of Inception 1907 HQ Vadodara Promoters Publicly shareholders and Chirayu Amin familyAlembic's factory, in the mid-1930s, was so technologically advanced that it manufactured its own internal combustion engine running on 'power alcohol' - a product that mixed alcohol with petrol in a 4:1 ratio to increase engine performance and efficiency, while reducing pollution at the same time.Later, in the 1940s, when public sentiment turned against alcohol in Gujarat, Alembic moved on to making cough syrups, vitamins, tonics and antibiotic drugs.""We've faced challenges every decade, but strong fundamentals have helped us sail through. We've never taken short-cuts in business,"" says Pranav Amin, managing director of Alembic.""Our strong point is that we respect technology a lot. We never ever backed out of investing in technology,"" Amin added.Alembic Pharmaceuticals reported profits of Rs 698 crore last fiscal. The company's international generics vertical reported 75 per cent Y-o-Y growth, driven by strong traction in the US.The US generic business is likely to drive international business over the next two years on the back of 13-14 product launches, according to an HDFC Securities stock report.""The world has become a very dynamic place. Companies have to be nimble-footed. We have to keep re-inventing every day,"" Amin sums up.Year of Inception 1839 Headquarters Chennai Promoters Public shareholders and Murugappa GroupLike all free traders, the lure of commodities brought Thomas Parry, an English trader, to India. Parry & Co started off as a general trading company dealing in sugar and spirits.""By the late 19th century, the company had emerged as one of the largest traders of sugar with a firm grip over South Indian market. Parry & Co was so strong then that it floated two separate companies  East India Distilleries and Sugar Factories Ltd,"" says business historian Raman Mahadevan.In 1962, Parry & Co merged the two companies to become EID Parry. The Murugappa group acquired control over EID Parry in 1981.EID Parry reported profits of Rs 25.34 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal compared with the corresponding quarter loss of Rs 138 crore in the previous year. The standalone sugar business of the company logged a PBIT (profit before interest and tax) of Rs 56 crore. The bio-products division (comprising pesticides and nutraceuticals) registered a PBIT of Rs 4 crore.""The company's performance was satisfactory, largely due to better price realisation on sugar. Going by the current trend in prices, the sugar scenario for the year remains positive,"" stated EID Parry managing director V Ramesh in a post-results media release.EID Parry, along with its units, has nine sugar factories having a capacity to crush 39,000 tonnes of cane a day, generate 160 MW of power and four distilleries having a capacity 230 kilolitres a day.Year of Inception 1887 Sector Jute Headquarters Kolkata Promoter BP AgarwalThe fortunes of Kamarhatty Company hit a downward spiral in the early 1980s, when plastic became more accepted in the packaging industry. Labour unrest, lower demand for jute and rising cost of production crippled the company even further in the subsequent years. This was around the time when most jute companies downed their shutters across India.Shortly after the Agarwals stepped in, the company's losses mounted and it slipped into BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) - and remained there for about 10 years, until 2001.""We're still in restructuring phase. It took us a long time to turn around,"" says SK Agarwal, managing director of Kamarhatty Company.In the last financial year, Kamarhatty recorded profits of Rs 1.5 crore. The company has also diversified into newer product segments like non-woven jute and linen yarns. ""We'll survive for many years, we've got expansion plans,"" assures Agarwal.Kamarhatty is among the few jute companies that are using technology to reduce labour and increase production efficiency. The company manufactures close to 30,000 tonnes of jute every year - using almost 75 per cent of its installed capacity.Kamarhatty has reduced its head count from over 6,000 a few years ago to about 5,000 now. It intends to round off total workforce to about 2,500 in three years.""Demand for jute is slowly picking up. Several countries have banned plastic completely. These markets should give us good business in future,"" Agarwal adds. Kamarhatty faces stiff competition from Bangladesh-based jute mills, which sell their wares 30- 40 per cent cheaper than Indian companies.Year of Inception 1841 HQ Kolkata Promoter Bharat BajoriaKaamjaari, the traditional way of distributing work among garden employees, is still practised at Teesta Valley tea gardens. Every evening, after the day's work, garden supervisors are handed out chores which workers have to complete the next day.When 900 workers come for work the next day  at 7.30 am  they are fairly well aware of the tasks at hand. The 850-hectare-tea estate is divided into several sections are manned by a pool of supervisors, whose job is to walk around and inspect the work. Fifteen minutes after 4 pm, when workers file out for their homes, supervisors walk back to the estate office to get their next day's mandate. The 175-year-old company exports special teas to Japan, Germany and the UK, among other developed markets.""Discipline is the key to success of any tea garden. We still follow old British traditions,"" says RK Dixit, who has spent 60 years managing tea gardens across the North East, and is on the board of Teesta Valley Tea Company.Despite the regimented work method, the company ran into rough weather post Independence, when demand (for tea) and prices declined globally. Weather also played havoc on the crop in 1950, 1953 and 1955. In the mid-60s and 70s, the company faced problems from trade unions.""The last three years have been bad for most tea companies. Global tea prices have fallen 10-15 per cent and the cost of production is steadily going up,"" Dixit says.But he is sanguine. ""This company will live on for many years. We've already commenced uprooting old tea bushes and replacing them with new ones. New bushes will mature for plucking in 8 years and will yield for the next 40-50 years,"" Dixit adds.Year of Inception 1876 Headquarters Kolkata Sector Stock trading, NBFC operations Promoters A group of individualsThe previous management of Amluckie sold their tea gardens in the late-1960s when business became tough for the industry. The next two decades were pretty staid for Amluckie. When the current management took over reins of the company in mid-90s, it just had a capital base of Rs 20 lakh and a functional non-banking finance company (NBFC) licence.""Even brand recall was not there as the company had exited its tea business long ago,"" says Santosh Jain, CFO of Amluckie Investment Company.The company, owned by a group of individuals, does proprietary stock trading and SME lending these days. Amluckie has a loan book of Rs 10 crore.""We're profitable in a small way. We have expansion plans to grow our business. We're actively considering venturing into microfinance and asset reconstruction businesses,"" adds Jain.Promoters Public shareholders and India GovernmentBanks Allahabad Bank, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Canara Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab & Sind Bank, Central Bank and State Bank of Mysore.The Presidency banks, namely Bank of Bengal, Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay, were established by the East India Company more than a century ago with a view to manage its finances in the country and also lend money to the Indian mercantile class.However, these banks (managed by the Brits) were not comfortable lending money to Indian businessmen, mainly because they found it difficult to understand the 'HUF-way' (Hindu Undivided Family) of doing business. They failed to even grasp the 'chopda' system of book-keeping, prevalent among traditional Indian business families then. Among the three Presidency banks, Bank of Bombay was more liberal in terms of offering loans to Indians, albeit at higher coupon rates.This resulted in the setting up of banks like Allahabad Bank (1865) and Punjab National Bank (1895), with many influential Indians of those times on the board. Allahabad Bank is the oldest public sector bank in India while Punjab National Bank is the first bank to be purely managed by Indians. Freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai was actively associated with the creation of Punjab National Bank.The formation of RBI in 1935 and the promulgation of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and amendment to the Act in 1965 helped these banks to operate in a regulated environment.""These banks survived long mainly because of nationalisation in 1969. The government induced capital and also gave business to these banks to stay afloat,"" explains veteran political economist and author Amiya Kumar Bagchi.""The government forced these banks to spread out to rural areas, which strengthened their roots firmly. The Green Revolution helped these banks to grow their business portfolios significantly"" Bagchi adds.Some of these banks are facing severe stress of bad loans (NPAs) currently."

In the case of bridesin-the-waiting, the concern is rooted in the popular perception which suggests diabetes is, almost always, hereditary . That the unaffected partner might have to lead a 'restricted life' - diabetes patients usually advised to follow a disciplined lifestyle, especially in terms of food and a work-out regime - is also another deterrent, some claim.Take the case of 29-year old Mahesh Reddy* who was rejected twice, on disclosing his diabetic condition.""When I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes some time ago, I wasn't even aware that it could stand in the way of my getting married. While my doctor has confirmed that the disease will not affect my married life, it still isn't enough to convince others. I fail to understand how being a diabetic can be a deal breaker when it comes to marriages,"" said a perplexed Reddy .For 26-year-old Arpita Mukherjee*, who was diagnosed with diabetes less than six months ago and has been rejected by one prospective groom since, the larger battle lies in convinc ing her parents that the disease is not a hindrance to a happy married life.""Ever since I was diagnosed with diabetes, my parents began fast-tracking the process of groom hunting.They fear that being diagnosed with diabetes at such a young age is linked to genetic predisposition -which prospective grooms always enquire about. Getting rejected by one only affirmed their fears,"" said Mukherjee.Like them there are several others - in the marriageable age bracket --who are now being asked to 'furnish' a blood sugar test report before being 'considered' for an alliance.City endocrinologists confirm this trend and add how they are constantly faced with enquiries about a diabetic patient's 'eligibility' to get married. They, however, rubbish the misconceptions associated the disease.""Techies as young as 25 are getting diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Since most of them are still unmarried at that age, getting diagnosed with the disease ruins their chances of finding a spouse due to the stigma associated with it. Contrary to popular belief, living with a diabetic patient does not increase the chances of the spouse (or children) getting diabetes as well. Diabetes is also not directly linked to potency and fertility, which are two of the biggest fears among those who refuse to marry diabetic patients,"" said Sharat Reddy, executive director and interventional cardiologist at Maxcure Hospitals in Madhapur.Type 2 diabetes is marked by an increase in blood sugar levels due to the body's inability to produce ample amount of insulin. While it can be treated through medication, poor monitoring of the disease can lead to cardiovascular diseases and heart strokes.""Nearly 90% of those being diagnosed with this are people working in the IT industry . While this is a serious concern, it primarily happens because this group of professionals are only focused on their careers and pay no heed to their health,"" said Shyam Kalavalapalli, endocrinologist at Idea Centres Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Adiposity while allying fears about Type 2 diabetes ruining marriages.(*Names changed to protect identity)"

They just want the company to re-draw the transmission line from areas others than Dindori taluka. ""We are grape farmers and use iron angles to raise the creepers. The overhead wire falling down and touching the angles or the towers coming carshing down on any of the grape farms would only mean catastrophe for the farmers,"" another farmer Nilesh Katore said.MLA Narhari Zhirwal, president of Kadwa Cooperative Sugar Factory, Sreeram Shete and others demanded that the farmers in the radius of the tower also should be given the compensation for the loss of crop due to collapse of these towers on their fields. ""The PGCIL should buy the land from the farmers to avoid such mishaps. First demand would be to scrap the line, but if that is not possible the farmers should be paid compensation for the land,"" Shete said.Uday Kisve, sub-divisional officer, Dindori, took the message to the district collector Radhakrishnan B who has arranged for the meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue and come out with the solution.

The truck was released only after police intervened. ""Following this incident, all the vehicles were stopped at border check posts,"" the official said.Meanwhile, truck owners were advised not to operate trucks to Karnataka via Bannari, Guddalore, Palar and Hosur until the situation returns to normalcy. ""Following the bandh call, we have informed our federation members not to operate trucks to Karnataka,"" said M R Kumarasamy, president of State Lorry Owners' Federation.Nearly 40,000 trucks from Tamil Nadu daily pass through Karnataka to northern parts of the country. With truck services coming to a halt, supply of agricultural products such as coconut, vegetables and sugar cane to other states would be badly hit, he said.Truck drivers stranded in the protest said they were finding it difficult to meet their basic needs like shelter and food. ""We usually cook food wherever we stop the truck. But, for the first time, we are trapped in one place for five days with goods,"" said C Ganesan, a truck driver. He said more than 500 trucks were halted near Soolagiri for the past five days.Many pro-Kannada outfit members, meanwhile, protested on Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border, condemning Supreme Court's direction to the state asking it to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu. They also burnt TN chief minister M Jayalalithaa in effigy at Jujuwadi, near Hosur and also raised slogans against her.With the inter-state bus services hit, commuters had a harrowing time. K Prabhavathy, 58, a private schoolteacher from Salem, was to leave for Shirdi from Bengaluru on Jet Airways on Friday night. She had no other option but travel to Bengaluru on Thursday evening.""It's my first pilgrimage tour to Shirdi and I didn't want to miss it for any reason,"" Prabhavathy told TOI over mobile phone from Bengaluru Airport. ""I was told by my relatives about the bandh. So, I decided to reach the Airport well in advance,"" she said.Like her, many passengers had to either reschedule or drop their travel plans.

Price of pulses shot up 35.8% in July as against 26. 6% in the last month.The government revised upwards the inflation rate for May to 1.2% from the previous 0.8%, highlighting the firming up of price pressure. Vegetable prices rose 28% in July compared to last month's 16.9% increase.Fruit prices soared 17.3% (6% in June), while sugar prices shot up 32.3% (26% in June).The sharp increase in WPI inflation mirrors the firming up of prices in the retail inflation data. The widely watched consumer price index (CPI) breached RBI's interim target of 5% by inching past the 6% mark in July. The central bank largely looks at the retail inflation data. The government has recently notified the new inflation target of 4% - plus/minus 2% - for the next five years and rising price pressure will test the new RBI governor who will replace Raghuram Rajan. Rajan steps down early next month.The government is hopeful that the robust monsoon rains will help improve supplies and moderate inflationary pressures. The RBI kept interest rates unchanged in its latest monetary policy but pointed to the lurking price pressure.Economists said they expect wholesale inflation to be above 4% in the months ahead.""...As such, we expect headline WPI inflation to exceed 4% in coming months.

To transport chilled milk and other products all over the Arabian Peninsula, add 9,000 vehicles.None other than King Salman's favored son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has held up the dairy, Almarai, as a model for a country trying to. But even companies like Almarai, with no apparent connection to petroleum, rely on the cheap energy provided by the kingdom.That is coming to an end.and an increasingly costly war in Yemen have torn aand created a crisis that has led to cuts in public spending, reductions in take-home pay and benefits for government workers and a host of new fees and fines. Huge subsidies for fuel, water and electricity that encourage overconsumption are being curtailed. For Almarai, one of the top brands in the Middle East, that will mean $133 million from the bottom line this year, company officials said.has sent tremors through a nation whose citizens have long enjoyed a cosseted lifestyle underwritten by the state.""The government is moving very fast at reforming things in Saudi Arabia while the people are finding themselves left behind,"" said Lama Alsulaiman, a businesswoman and board member of the Jidda Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""Life as usual and business as usual can no longer continue.""Rewriting the social contract carries high risks for the 31-year-old deputy crown prince, who has stakedhis reputation on transforming the economy.""People are looking to see if he can do it,"" said Ibrahim Alnahas, a political-science professor at King Saud University in Riyadh, the capital. ""If so, his future would be king. If not, his future would be lost.""The vast subterranean seas of petroleum here have seeped into almost every part of the Saudi economy. Crude oil does more than deliver billions of dollars in profits to Saudi Aramco , the state oil company, and Sabic, the chemical giant; it also buttresses energy-intensive sectors such as cement production and aluminum smelting.Saudi Arabia burns barrel after barrel of crude oil for electricity, one of the few countries to do so in large quantities. Commercial air-conditioners cool shopping malls as temperatures outside soar past 100 degrees in the summer, and children go sledding at Snow City, a frigid new recreation center in the capital. Much of the drinking water needed to keep this desert nation alive comes from energy-draining desalination. And the SUVs idling in Riyadh's enormous traffic snarls drain gasoline.""It is striking the extent to which every major industry relies on cheap energy, whether directly or indirectly,"" said Glada Lahn, co-author of a study for Chatham House, a London think tank, which warned that the kingdom could become a net importer of oil within a few decades if it did not make significant changes.Saudi Arabia's about-face last month at a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Algeria, agreeing to cut production to raise the price of crude, showed the urgency policymakers here are feeling. Mohammed announced plans this year to sell off a small piece of the country's economic crown jewel, Saudi Aramco, to free up money for investment.The budget deficit was nearly $100 billion last year. The country's foreign reserves have dropped by a quarter since oil prices started falling in 2014. The government has taken loans from foreign banks and will try to borrow more from the global bond market.Hedge funds are wagering that the Saudi central bank will be forced to revalue its currency, the riyal. Zach Schreiber, the head of PointState Capital, which made $1 billion betting that oil would fall, told investors in May that the Saudi riyal was ""massively overvalued"" and that the country had only ""two to three years of runway before it hits a wall.""The government has abruptly cut construction projects, forcing contractors to lay off workers. This year, foreign laborers set fire to buses in protests demanding months of back pay. The sudden jump in water bills this spring led to such an outcry on social media that the minister for water and electricity was fired after telling customers to dig their own wells if they were unhappy with prices.""If you're a Saudi, you've grown up with that expectation of the financial largesse that's dished out,"" said Adel Hamaizia, the vice chairman of the Oxford Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Studies Forum. ""Things are likely to get more difficult for the government in terms of managing frustration from the everyday people.""Adding to the pressure, the kingdom's population has nearly doubled since 1990. With half of all Saudis younger than 25, the private sector does not offer enough good opportunities for the estimated 300,000 young people entering the workforce each year, especially women. Fewer of the public sinecures that have sustained earlier generations are available, with plans for deeper cuts.Despite Saudi Arabia's image as a haven for Ferrari-driving sheikhs with stables full of racehorses, oil revenue is much lower per capita than in small states like Qatar or Kuwait. There is poverty in the kingdom as well as an increasingly anxious middle class.One evening last month, it was a stifling 99 degrees in Riyadh after sunset, with dust hanging in the air. Um Rashed Al-Rashed was selling jewelry and baskets of seeds at a small souk, hoping to supplement her husband's modest pension.""The prices are increasing for everything,"" Rashed said. The couple's electricity bill after the Ramadan holidays was so high they could no longer afford it, so the power was shut off. ""Only a camel can live without electricity,"" she said.On billboards across the country, the king, crown prince and Mohammed appear, eyes toward the horizon, with a purple 2030 logo with the national emblem  a palm tree and crossed swords  above them. The Vision 2030 plan calls for a steady diversification of the economy during the next 14 years.That would include expanding the country's mining industries to exploit gold, phosphate and uranium deposits, and building up the financial, technology and entertainment sectors. And while many countries declare that they will generate added revenue through tourism, only Saudi Arabia has Mecca, which more than 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide are instructed to visit on a pilgrimage before they die.Mohammed, the deputy crown prince, gathered business leaders, government officials and even athletes and artists at the palatial Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh late last year to discuss the economic targets his team was developing. Consultants with tablet computers fanned out across the country, surveying Saudis to determine how far the government could pare back subsidies without sparking protests.After decades of rule by octogenarian kings, some young Saudis said in interviews that they felt energized by the role played by a prince from their generation.""Subsidies should have been done a long time ago. Things are still so cheap,"" said Salman M. Al Suhaibaney, a Saudi entrepreneur, holding up his drink to demonstrate. ""This bottle of water is more expensive than the same amount of gas.""Al Suhaibaney founded an app for tow trucks called Morni, like an Uber for roadside assistance, including fixing flat tires, delivering gas and jumping batteries. His business is in a government-supported startup incubator in a Riyadh office building. Staffed by 20 young Saudis, Morni is a model for the kind of business the government, and in particular the tech-savvy deputy crown prince, hopes will buoy the workforce.But more public funds are needed right now to close the budget gap. The government has announced plans to more than triple non-oil revenue by 2020, starting with rising fees for visas, higher fines for traffic violations and a sin tax on sugary drinks.Officials have seized on every opportunity to squeeze costs. After cutting pay for ministers, freezing hiring and curtailing regular bonuses and overtime for the entire public sector workforce, the government announced last week that workers would be paid according to the Gregorian calendar (as in the United States and Europe), instead of the slightly shorter Islamic Hijri calendar, adding roughly one unpaid workday a month.""If your salary is going down and your costs are going up, something's got to give,"" said Hamaizia of the Oxford Gulf and Arabian Peninsula Studies Forum.Less spending by government, businesses and increasingly strapped consumers means less growth and fewer jobs. The only way to create more jobs for Saudis in such an environment may be by getting rid of foreign workers and replacing them with locals. That policy, known as Saudization, has been pursued at least since the early 1980s and always failed, with the number of foreign laborers ballooning from roughly 1 million to 10 million.Now, though, the government is pressing companies harder. Foreign workers cost less, but the government levies fines and refuses to renew visas for foreign workers if business rosters dip below a certain percentage of Saudis. The kingdom's targets for increasing employment include more than 450,000 new private-sector jobs by 2020.The Almarai dairy employs 8,000 Saudis among its workforce of more than 40,000. On a recent morning, 150 Holsteins moseyed into the milking parlor where workers from Kenya, the Philippines and elsewhere hooked them up to automated pumps. The business  which also produces yogurt and cheese and includes a bakery  has its own training academy for Saudis, drawing 15,000 applicants annually for just 400 slots.Prince Sultan bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Kabeer, a member of the extended Al Saud royal family and one of those rich Saudis with a stable of thoroughbreds, founded Almarai in 1977 with the help of Irish dairy farmers.""We try to keep it to a standard that if the prince wants to come in tomorrow with his friends, he's welcome,"" said Tony Gavin, the Irish manager of the largest Almarai dairy farm, in Al Kharj, southeast of Riyadh. Wearing brown shorts and Ray-Ban sunglasses, Gavin gave a tour of the sprawling farm.The cows rest under a cooling mist scattered by large fans, the temperature and quantity of water computer controlled. A nutritionist optimizes the cows' diet with cottonseed from Greece, sugar beet pellets from the Netherlands and locally grown alfalfa.But the government has dictated that dairies must phase out local feed production because water is so scarce. Despite its arid environment, Saudi Arabia once pursued large-scale farming, even becoming a wheat exporter before all but abandoning cultivation to save water. Almarai has bought farmland in Argentina, California and Arizona to produce alfalfa to ship here.Still, the business is getting squeezed. While utility and feed prices are rising, the dairy has not been allowed to raise the price of milk.""We've tried in the past, and the king sort of tapped us on the shoulder and said, 'What are you doing?'"" said Stuart Gouk, manufacturing manager at the plant here. Higher milk prices could have political repercussions.The kingdom's subsidy cutbacks are expected to deepen. There may well come a point where, as with wheat farming, policymakers will have to decide whether it really makes sense to produce milk in the desert.""People who visit can't believe there are cow herds here,"" Gavin said, ""but they never thought about where the milk comes from.""(Sheikha al-Dosary contributed reporting from Riyadh.)"

Until now the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS&D) a Civil Supplies Ministry outfit, was in charge of purchasing bags under the mandatory packaging order.The Cabinet in August decided to give the regulator the role of purchasing bags.Under the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging ) Act 1987, 90 per cent of the food grains produced in the country and 20 per cent of the sugar production is to be packaged in jute sacks. Since the promulgation of the Act, the DGS&D was the agency entrusted with purchasing these bags mainly with involvement of multiple agencies. The jute sector has often locked horns with the flat tape manufacturers (the synthetic bag industry) which also had a major stake in the packaging business.In recent times there have often been complaints against a section of the jute industry for supplying substandard bags, recycled bags and bags imported cheap from Nepal for supply under the Act.Protection issueThe Union Textiles Ministry which administers the jute sector, has repeatedly flagged the issue saying the protection extended to the centuries-old industry was being misused.While a section of the industry and some political leaders of the ruling party in West Bengal, have expressed apprehension about this role-change, Jute Commissioner Subrata Gupta said that the organisation was fully-geared up to commence its new functions. The JCs office is suitably equipped to handle this additional charge.Five banks would carry out the transaction, he said adding that the JC will not handle the payments directly. The banks will handle the responsibility of collecting funds from the state procurement agencies and pay the jute mills with periodic reconciliation."

The government has also stopped holding tripartite meetings from 2009. By October 1, every year the Centre announced FRP, but, this time it has betrayed the cane farmers, which clearly shows that the government was least bothered about farmers, he alleged.""We have decided to hold a massive rally at Delhi in association with national level cane grower associations to pressurise the centre to announce (new) FRP"", he said.

Meeting the faces behind the online initiative helped create a buzz, especially in Tirupur, Salem and Coimbatore.Paleo is essentially a diet based on food presumed to have been eaten by early humans in the paleolithic age.The diet, which encourages consumption of meat, vegetables, and fruit, has been around for a couple of years, but is finding a growing tribe of Tamil speaking followers after Tamil blogger Neander Selvan started propagating the diet and founded the Facebook (FB) group.Though doctors warn that for people who have lived on a carb-rich diet all their life the switch without the guidance of a medical professional may result in serious side effects, those who follow the diet seem to swear by its efficacy in terms of weight loss and diabetes and blood pressure control.""Meeting people who have turned paleo for the past couple years has made me feel more confident about the practice,"" says 29-year-old Manoj K Samy, a control engineer at TCS, Bengaluru, who following the lowcarb, high-fat diet for 75 days, claims to have lost 18kg and gained more energy. Though he also does yoga, he credits his food habit for the physical transformation.Manoj Vijayakumar, a paleo diet follower for the past 28 months, says the FB group has doctors acting as advisors for people with a medical his tory of diabetes and kidney problems.""Senior group members, who are not medical professionals, also guide fresh converts, usually recommend ing detailed blood tests and custom ised diet plans,"" says Vijayakumar. He however warns of fever, headache and giddiness, in the initial days of the diet, which he says is the body's reac tion to going off carbs.Here is where the risk runs, says nutritionist Shiny Chandran. ""There is no debate that cutting carbs helps in weight loss and is effective for those who are insulin resistant but it has to be monitored by doctors as sugar fluc tuations are dangerous, especially for the diabetic. Apart from people with diabetes there are at least 15 other conditions for which this diet is unsuitable. Consult a medical professional be fore starting on the diet,"" she cautions.While, paleo proselytes follow the diet which excludes carbs, sugar, leg umes and dairy products, there are others who follow modified versions that allow dairy but no carbs. Vegetar ian paleo dieters say they have re placed meat with nuts that are high in Omega 3 content.The perceived benefits of paleo have made 40-year-old Vijayakumar forget his love for thayir sadam.

58f6ac427be9e031f13b9b9c,Cauvery water dispute: The reason behind the rage in Karnataka's Mandya,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Cauvery-water-dispute-The-reason-behind-the-rage-in-Karnatakas-Mandya/articleshow/54264903.cms,2016-09-10,"Venkatesh P, a 30-something progressive farmer in Panakanahalli of Mandya taluk, the hub of the Cauvery basin in Karnataka, talks about how the rice they grow and eat has run out. Karnataka has had continuous drought and it's been two seasons since farmers have been able to grow rice. All the grain stored for the figurative rainy day has been used up this year.""My family, which grows rice and which has sold it to feed the town's people for generations, is now dependent on rice from the public distribution system. Is there anything left for me to say?"" he asks.As the 125-year-old dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over sharing the waters of the Cauvery runs its latest course this year, there are heated debates, intense politicking, hate speeches and street protests - this time spilling over to social media also.However, the real issue is not Karnataka versus Tamil Nadu, as was the case in 1991 - it is the shortage of water in Mandya for its standing crops. The situation could affect everyone in Mandya, including the sizeable Tamilian presence in the district - many farm workers are Tamilian, each village has a Tamil colony and most of the farm equipment comes from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu.""What are the Tamils here going to eat if we don't grow our rice? Why doesn't anyone understand that it's a human problem, not a language one?"" asks Mukudappa, a farmer who took part in a tyreburning protest in Mandya city.The official website of Mandya district describes it as 'the land of sugar and rice' and 'a prominent agricultural district.' In 2014-15, which was the second successive drought year for Karnataka, state agriculture department figures show that paddy and sugarcane cultivation in Mandya district was almost 60 per cent of its target. This year, despite copious rains all over the state, except in the traditionally rain-rich Malnad region, the catchment area for the Cauvery, Sharavathi and Tungabhadra rivers, farmers have sown 26,757 hectares of paddy and sugarcane, 63 per cent less than the target of 72,460 hectares.This has provoked rage on the streets, with traffic blocked on the Bengaluru-Mysuru state highway leading to estimated losses of over Rs 100 crore in just four days. Farmers pin their woes on water mismanagement by the state government and the perceived ""inadequate preparation and presentation"" of their case in the Supreme Court.""We planted our crops this year two months late, only after district in-charge minister DK Shivakumar told us to go ahead. He promised us water. Last year, though there was water in the Cauvery, the government took up repair work of the Visvesvaraya canal that feeds our district and didn't release water. We have missed two crops of paddy, three crops of sugarcane. If they give whatever water we have now to Tamil Nadu, what are we to do? Even if we starve, what are our politicians sitting in their cushy houses in Bengaluru going to eat?"" asks a furious farmer, Vivekumar TC of Tandasanahalli.Acre upon acre of standing crops in Mandya will wilt unless water is supplied through the canal. ""We have spent Rs 15,000 an acre for paddy, Rs 25,000 for sugarcane. If we don't get crops this year also, we have no option but to kill ourselves,"" says Ramu of K Gowdagere, raising the bogey of last year's 400-odd suicides in just this district.Ramesh and Govindaraju point to their newly planted crop in Hosabudanuru. ""If this doesn't get water and dries up, we will have to migrate, take up labour jobs and forget farming,"" says Ramesh.The Congress government in the state, caught in a cleft stick with hardly 46.7 thousand million cubic feet of water in all four Cauvery basin reservoirs, has released some water into the Visvesvaraya canal as well as to Tamil Nadu, while complying with the Supreme Court's September 5 directive to release more water to the neighbouring state. Angry farmers have attempted suicide by jumping into the swirling waters going to Tamil Nadu, while others are sitting by the Visvesvaraya canal, waiting for water to come.While their children protest on the streets, other farmers are quickly sowing more paddy, hoping for divine intervention, rains or relief from the Supreme Court and fervently hoping the state government will find a way to provide them with water in accordance with the schedule up to November 10.On the streets, however, there is visible fury against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah , whose face is being hammered even on ambulances carrying patients. Water resources minister MB Patil and senior advocate Fali S Nariman, appearing for Karnataka, are the other favourite targets, while there is both anger and grudging admiration for Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa , who has managed to get a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court every single time.There are references to Jayalalithaa's childhood in Melkote of Mandya district. ""She is a woman born here and yet each time, she targets us. M Karunanidhi (DMK chief and former CM of Tamil Nadu) has more concern and understanding - he doesn't behave like she does, he tries to be fair to everyone,"" says Chetan, another protester at Mandya's Sanjay circle.""She can get things done. Our politicians are useless,"" protester HK Nandakumar of Holalu chimes in. There are the usual vitriolic Congress-Janata Dal (S) political discussions and some references to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the youngsters, who want their protests WhatsApp-ed to the PM in the hope of some relief.There are, however, no discussions on whether water conservation methods and alternative cropping patterns suggested by the state's agriculture and water resources departments could solve the problem.""Forget the government - our traditional methods will work in this situation. Why can't we try to grow crops from water that we conserve ourselves? There is absolutely no awareness or knowledge of how to sustain and work with nature. We have lost all that our ancestors knew and are instead sinking bore wells for water. At this rate, we will also turn into an arid district like Chikballapur,"" says SC Madhuchandan of Sunaganahally, who runs a farmers' cooperative in Mandya that is trying to revert to water-conservative organic methods in the district.Another member of his cooperative, Mahadev KN of Karaswadi, says he has managed to sow one acre of paddy at a cost of Rs 3,000, which makes growing it more sustainable. ""We need to opt for such methods and all our farmers have to stop taking water in the canal for granted. Not just us, even the people in Tamil Nadu have to think along these lines,"" he contends.State agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda says he has been constantly advocating a change in the cropping pattern and has issued directives asking people not to plant paddy this year due to the distress. Water resources minister Patil has been trying to promote the use of drip irrigation for paddy and sugarcane, which cuts water usage to a trickle and doubles output. He has even chalked out a project involving the government, private sugar mills and farmers, but this has yet to get off the ground.""We need to think along these lines of conservation and better use of water and soil for our crops.Nature is changing and we have to adapt. We cannot depend on governments and courts to bail us out when the rainfall itself is inadequate,"" says Sridhar, another progressive farmer from Holalu.The man on the street, however, is still burning wood and tyres, blocking traffic and burning effigies of Siddaramaiah and Jayalalithaa.

While the number of Kolkatans with high blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar was higher than the national average, skipping meals was more common among then than the residents of other metros. What has made the city's cardiac future even bleaker is that Kolkata has more smokers and alcohol drinkers than other major cities.Conducted by Saffolalife, the survey studied the lifestyle of cities through a composite score and ascertained lifestyle impact on heart health. On most counts, the city fared poorly. Incidence of high cholesterol in Kolkata, for instance, is 33%, higher than the all-India average of 28%. Also, 28% Kolkatans surveyed turned out to have a high fasting blood sugar level, higher than the all-India average of 21%. The city also has the highest proportion of people with high BP at 20%, a figure much higher than the allIndia's 11% figure, Mumbai's 14% and Delhi's 6%.Irregular food habit was quintessential to Kolkata, the survey said. As much as 75% here skip a meal, the highest among key cities (59% in Mumbai and Delhi; 61% across India). While 72% took wholegrain food, higher than the national average of 58%, 43% Kolkatans regularly ate fruits, less than Delhi's 49%.Consumption of green leafy vegetables, however, is high in Kolkata at 44%, higher than the national average of 39%.The city also seemed sleep-deprived, the survey showed. While only 26% citizens got optimal 7-10 hours of sleep, lowest in India (national average stands at 53%), only 32% Kolkatans got sound sleep, again the lowest in the country (national average stands at 47%). ""While the findings do reflect the cardiac health trends of Kolkata, it excludes a few key factors. One is the sharp rise in the consumption of carbohydrates, which has contributed to the growth in cardiac ailments in recent years even as we seem to be magnifying the ill-effects that marginal cholesterol poses,"" said cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar Screening of cardiac health, however, was better in Kolkata, the study revealed, with only 31% people never checking their sugar levels; the all-India figure is higher at 35%. While 47% Mumbaikars surveyed did not get their BP checked, in Kolkata, the number is 22%.The city also has better women's heart health awareness than other metros."

An MPCB official said that the 15 sugar factories had crushed excess sugarcane than the stipulated quantity in the 2015-16 season. It also said that industrial units have not followed norms on precautions over effluent treatment plants.Three units of these six industries are members of the central effluent treatment plant (CETP) in the Kagal MIDC area. However, they have not connected the pipeline to the plant for treating the waste material.Last year, the MPCB had forfeited bank guarantees of 17 sugar factories amounting to Rs 85 lakh for flouting environmental norms.Each year, factories have to apply for MPCB permissions to crush a specific quanityt of sugarcane each day. The quantity of pollutants generated during sugar production is proportionate to its crushing capacity.Pune divisional commissioner S Chockalingam had in June asked the MPCB to check the limit at each factory and the actual sugarcane crushed. Following this, the MPCB found 15 sugar factories that had crossed the prescribed crushing limits.During a recent visit to Kolhapur, Chockalingam had asked the MPCB to take action against those factories falling in the Panchganga river basin that crushed excess sugarcane than the allotted quota each day. He had also asked sub-divisional magistrates to take action against these establishments under section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for causing danger to public health and issue notices to these factories.N H Shivangi, regional officer of the MPCB, Kolhapur, said, ""We found that 15 factories crushed excess sugarcane than the stipulated quantity allotted each day. The proposal to seize the bank guarantees will help keep a check on other sugar factories in the next crushing season. We have sent the proposal to our head office. Once we get approval, we will seize the bank guarantee of these sugar factories.""The bank guarantee varies from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh depending on the sugarcane crushing capacity at each factory."

But it also retains 80% of the original Kavuni rice's health benefits.""We crossed the original kavuni rice with the popular and widely consumed CO 50 variety of white rice way back in 2005,"" said P Jeya Prakash, head of the rice department at TNAU. ""It took us almost nine years to keep crossing them to finally arrive at a variety that had the properties we expected,"" he said.Cultivation trials of the rice are currently under way across the state.The traditional Kavuni rice is grown in small scale in the Karaikudi region, and gives a yield of hardly 800kg to 900kg per acre. It is mainly used to make sweet dishes.""There is a belief that despite being a sweet or dessert, consumption of the rice does not increase the sugar levels in the body,"" said Jeya Prakash. ""But since the rice can only be used to make sweet dishes, specifically requires shorter days to mature, flowers only between October and November and easily gets dislodged by wind, it was cultivated in just small patches,"" he said.TNAU began studying this rice in 2005 to see if it can be made commercially viable. ""We conducted biochemical studies on the rice to confirm if it actually contained anti-diabetic properties,"" said S Robin, the head researcher for the project and current dean of post-graduate studies at TNAU.""We then discovered that it contains less carbohydrates. The colour consists of phenols which inhibit the enzymes which break down the starch. So the starch breakdown and glucose release process is delayed by almost 30 minutes,"" he said. ""It also contains anthocyanin which fights stress and carotenoids which strengthens muscles in the eyes,"" Robin said.""The crop duration is 135 to 140 days, it can be cultivated year round, requires regular irrigation and does not get dislodged easily,"" Robin said. ""The yield is also 2,000kg per acre which is close to average white rice yield which is around 2,400kg per acre,"" he said.The rice is to be cooked by taking equal quantities of the Kovai Kavuni rice and white rice and boiling it to make idlis and dosas. While they do still retain the brown colour, they taste similar to the normal white rice dishes."

And that little gap in awareness often results in patients having to foot medical bills that are almost four times that of routine diabetes management.Whether it is Raj Kumar , the 52-year-old semi-literate farmer from Chennai, or 77year-old convent-schooled Maureen Platel - both of whom were present at diabetes and foot care awareness discussion on Thursday at MV Hospital for Diabetes in Royapuram along with a hundred others like them to share their stories of losing or almost losing a limb - lack of knowledge was their testimony.People with diabetes, says Dr Vishwanathan , head & chief diabetologist at MV Hospital, tend to ignore complications in their foot until they get so severe that the limb needs amputation. ""By educating patients it is possible to improve foot care practices among high risk foot diabetic patients and the diabetic amputees,"" he said.Point to note, says the doctor, for those without diabetes, is to do regular pedicures whether at home or at a salon, or at least scrub with a pumice stone.

Most of the members of the gang were traced back to villages in Bihar."" The kingpin of the gang, however, is still at large.With the festive season underway , nearly two lakh passengers have travelled to and from the Secunderabad railway station alone, and another one lakh from Nampally and Kacheguda stations, making it difficult to keep tab on all such activities. The heavy rush of passengers is likely to continue till Diwali.In another case, two men posing as cops were also arrested at Mahankali recently .Operating in busy marketplaces, the conmen found several easy targets.

The government is expected to make an announcement before January 26, according to Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.The move to flex-fuels will decrease pollution and encourage a diversion in the sugar industrys output away from sugar and towards ethanol, Mr. Gadkari said at the annual meeting of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) last month in New Delhi.Biofuel production would help farmers by supporting the diversification of agriculture into energy, power and bio-plastics, Mr. Gadkari said.Implications for auto industryA policy on flex-fuel vehicles is likely to affect the automotive industry in several ways. Flex-fuels are widely used in several countries, famously Brazil and the United States, where they are available at the pump; examples include E10, E15, E85, the number reflecting the proportion of ethanol.The technology for the engines that can take these fuels is certainly not new but making the engines available in India (Mr. Gadkari said he had asked Volkswagen to come up with a flex-fuel engine) will take the greater part of a year at least. It requires modifications along the supply chain and calibrating the engine for Indian conditions.Additionally, such a policy will give manufacturers who are already in flex-fuel markets an advantage over indigenous producers, according to industry expert V. Sumantran, Chairman of Celeris Technologies. Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Ford, Toyota, Nissan and Hyundai are among those who have a presence in Brazil and manufacture flex fuel cars.This begs the question: how viable is running existing petrol engines on blended fuels? While a regular vehicle not especially made for biofuels could run on these fuels for a few years, this is not a feasible strategy in the medium to long-term for several reasons.One of the reasons is that ethanol, unlike petrol, is prone to oxidation and this can cause gum-like sediments to accumulate in various engine parts. Ethanol also reacts with other materials in the car, such as rubber, and this causes degradation, according to Mr. Sumantran.Consequently, if flex fuels are to be rolled out, engines will have to be built for them  and this will mean an additional variant for manufacturers production plants.For companies [car manufacturers], it is the variety that kills them. Adding an additional line of engine variants is not cheap. All this accumulates as internal costs within the company and they do not like doing this unless they are forced or required to do it, Mr. Sumantran told The Hindu . Additional manufacturing costs are likely to be passed on in some measure to customers.Impacts on other industriesAt present, the most obvious and reliable source of bio-ethanol in India is sugarcane. The worlds second largest sugar market, India produces some Rs.800 billion of sugar and supports approximately 40 million people.Ethanol is produced from cane molasses, a by-product of the sugar production process. The governments current Ethanol Blending Policy mandates five per cent blending of ethanol with petrol, though in reality the average ethanol blending achieved has been just two per cent. The government wishes to achieve 10 per cent blending.A new flex-fuel policy will mean a diversion in the production process to support the production of ethanol rather than sugar. The government is keen to increase the ethanol component in this mix partly because the sugar industry has an excess supply problem and consequently sugar prices are depressed. Mills are mired in debt to cane farmers.An industry paper by McKinsey & Company suggests that 5 million MT (metric tonnes) of excess sugar could be exported or diverted to ethanol production.If a flex-fuel policy comes into effect, the additional ethanol demand will likely exceed what can be produced by diverting resources from sugar.However, according to Abinash Verma, Director General of ISMA, this demand does not necessarily have to be met via additional acreage under sugarcane. Some of it can come from sources other than molasses, such as cellulosic ethanol, made from bagasse or sugarcane tops, and some can come from improved farming practices or planting higher-yielding varieties of cane.Such differences in productivity are already evident across the country; Tamil Nadu yields 100 tonnes of sugar per hectare of cane, while Uttar Pradesh and Bihar yield 50-55 tonnes per hectare, Mr. Verma told The Hindu.Even if a ten per cent increase in sugarcane yield happens, this would produce 3 million tonnes extra of sugar or 2 billion litres of ethanol, Mr. Verma said, adding that this quantity of ethanol was equivalent to 7-8 per cent of Indias total petrol consumption. India imports more than 80 per cent of its crude oil so this will mean significant reductions in the oil bill.Social and environmental impactsFlex-fuel cars, and biofuels in general, are promoted because they are cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. However, their ability to generate more energy than is used in their production is in question.Additionally, an increase in bio-ethanol production has also raised concerns about food security, farmers livelihoods and the environment, including water usage.The National Policy on Biofuels (2009) , which directs the nations overall approach to biofuels, says these fuels will be produced using non-food feedstock (source materials) on wastelands, thereby allowing India to stay clear of the traditional food versus energy security debate that other countries have had to deal with.This claim is a hard-sell for some, such as P. Sainath, founder of the Peoples Archive of Rural India and an expert on famine and hunger. He does not believe these claims, saying there are no conclusive studies that can say categorically that food crop lands have not been encroached on in the past.Memories of Indias infamous and unsuccessful experiment with jatropha  a plant used to produce bio-diesel and promoted by the government across the country, are still fresh. The purported ability of the weed to grow on wastelands and its drought-resistant properties were not reflected in the ground realties of its commercial cultivation and the programme was not successful.Water shortages too are a problem, especially when it comes to sugarcane. Maharashtra for one just does not have enough water, with the Marathwada region already in the middle of a drought, Mr. Sainath said.Sugarcane is the largest water-guzzler we have, he said, adding that sugarcane farms constitute 6 per cent of land use but consume 70 per cent of the irrigation water in the State.Well-considered policy neededIt seems that a clear and well-considered policy, based on a considered approach that learns from past experience and does not lose sight of overarching objectives is needed, no matter where you stand on the flex-fuel debate.There is no sincerity in developing alternative fuels. This is just a magic bullet approach, Mr. Sainath says.Sugar mill operators would benefit from a clear and well-thought-out policy too. Considering whether oil marketing companies have enough storage capacity for ethanol, and reforming tax structures so transport of ethanol across State boundaries was not prohibitively expensive, are among the issues that needed to be considered, according to Mr. Verma.Investments have to be made to install special dispensing units at petrol pumps across the country and such investments should follow demand for the product, which comes after a clear policy has been articulated, Mr. Verma said.The policy ought to be carefully considered and aligned with the countrys overall objectives in the sector, according to Mr. Sumantran, who supports a larger scale shift towards biofuels as a national policy provided no food production is diverted.I think like a lot of our policy today, a serious matter like expansion of the use of bio-fuels as a national policy requires very careful consideration and planning to be successful, Mr. Sumantran said. For instance, he questions the utility of using more than 85 per cent ethanol in a blend, saying Brazil has stopped the practice for good reasons, and a technical and economic case study has to first be made. Automobile manufacturers also need to be given adequate lead time to comply with a new policy, Mr. Sumantran said, adding, In our hurry to appear to do things, we need to avoid hasty steps that will hurt the progress we wish to make.At present, themost obvious and reliable source ofbio-ethanol in Indiais sugarcane"

With the private colleges charging huge amounts as admission fees, bright but financially weak students can only dream of taking admission in them despite having the required marks.In a way , those who should be engineers are forced to take admission in ITIs (industrial training institutes) and those fit for odd jobs are becoming engineers because they have money . This system needs to be changed and we have proposed a system and informed the state government about it around three months ago. However, with the response being not up to the mark, I have asked Aditya Thackeray to pursue the matter,"" said Shivtare, also the guardian minister of Satara district.According to the proposed plan, the state government should come up with a merit list of financially weak students residing in rural and urban areas after a proper background check. Once the list is in place, the banks have to ensure education lo ans to these students for admission to the institutions.""The state government should make it mandatory for the banks to provide education loans to these students. The system should be on the lines of the agricultural loans, provided to farmers on a mandatory basis.Once the students starts studying, the role of the private institutions will come to the fore. They will have to pay the interest of the loan for these students. If any student fails to repay the loan after his or her education with the institution is over, the state government should chip in and repay the bank the principal amount. This move will help the financially weak students study in good institutions,"" the minister pointed out.Shivtare cautioned against making things political when asked if the state government was doing enough in the education sector considering that so many seats in the private engineering colleges were vacant.""Things shouldn't be seen in a political perspective all the time.

The decision was made taking into account apprehensions of weight loss due to late harvesting and of poaching by millers of neighbouring Karnataka especially from the sugar cane-rich Kolhapur and Sangli belt of western Maharashtra.Rumblings in the sugar sectorMaharashtra is the largest producer of sugar in India, contributing almost 37 per cent of the total national output. The 2016-17 sugar season is distinctly different for three reasons. First, this year marks the completion of a decade since major reforms were introduced in the Sugarcane Control (Order), 1966 via reduction of the aerial distance limit between two sugar units to 15 km from 50 km and the dropping of provision 5B, also known as Bhargava formula; the provision had enabled limited profit sharing out of excessive realisation from the sale of free sugar, in case of erratic cane supply, with cane farmers of the mill. Second, the estimated availability of sugar cane this year stands at 445 lakh tons, implying that the State will produce just 5 million tons (MT) of sugar as against 8.5 MT last season. With just 90 days of crushing, a large number of mills will remain shut resulting in idle machinery, extra manpower cost, and a likely default on term-loan repayment leading to non-performing assets. Third, the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, championing the cause of sugar cane farmers for the past 15 years, is agitating for an increased cane price.Cooperative sugar mills have contributed largely to the development of rural Maharashtra by providing consistent farm income to large shareholding members. But the ownership profile of sugar factories in the State has undergone a major change in the past decade with the amendment to Section 6A of the Sugarcane Control (Order), 1966. The change has also been accentuated by the questionable practice of lending banks, especially the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank, taking over assets under the provisions of the SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest) Act, 2002. Data indicate that altogether 68 cooperative units were liquidated and sold later to the private sector, to entities floated by cooperative barons themselves, with a few exceptions.The bigwigs of the sugar cooperatives, including former State cooperative ministers, floated private sugar units, in a way sowing the seeds of doubt on the working and efficacy of the cooperative model. The number of private sugar factories in Maharashtra has consistently increased from 2006-07. Almost 154 private sugar units have obtained Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM); at present there are 78 operational private sugar mills with total crushing capacity of 2.48 lakh tons of cane per day (TCD) as against a mere 12 private units a decade ago. In comparison the number of operational cooperative units stands at 102 with a capacity of 3.52 lakh TCD. Private sector capacity gradually increased from 10 per cent of the total sugar production in the State to 45 per cent.Cooperatives vs private millsThe natural question that arises is how the increase in private sector participation impacted the sugar cane payment and sugar recovery per ton of sugarcane crushed. The change in ownership pattern has impacted the cane price payment to the growers in the State (see graphs). To understand the payment dynamics, it is essential to understand the process of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP), a payment model unique to Maharashtra. Unlike other cane-producing States where the farmer brings his produce to the factory for crushing, in Maharashtra it is picked up by sugar millers from the farmers fields to ensure uninterrupted cane supply and smooth operations.The harvesting and transportation (H&T) cost thus incurred by millers is, however, ultimately deducted from the FRP paid to the farmers. A year-on-year analysis of H&T costs incurred by cooperative and private millers illustrates the larger impact. The private units have incurred Rs.57.07, Rs.48.58 and Rs.83.14 per ton on H&T more than cooperative units in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively, implying thereby that the cane farmers are burdened by an additional Rs.477.20 crore. Likewise, the cooperative sector sugar recovery rate, which is directly linked to the FRP paid to farmers, has always been higher than that of the private sector over the same period.The difference between cooperative and private sector in recovery when monetised, calculating on the basis of FRP fixed by the Government of India, comes to Rs.1076.10 crore. Shockingly, in some cases cooperative sugar units reported less H&T expenditure and better recovery before management was taken over by the private sector. If both H&T and recovery are put together in monetary terms, the ultimate loss is borne by sugar cane farmers due to dwindling payments under private mills.The common belief is that the private sector is competitive, efficient and professionally managed when compared to the cooperative sector. Ironically, the private sugar sector in Maharashtra doesnt stand the test of data. How can such differences between cooperative and private sector in sugar recovery and H&T cost  which are directly related to cane payment  be explained?Cooperative society members, with easy access to management, meetings of the board of directors and vigilance on the factory premises during and after crushing, bring in effective stakeholder participation in the overall working of mills. As a result there is better sugar recovery and considerable reduction in cost of H&T, thus financially benefitting the cane farmers. Given this backdrop, the recent trend of cooperative sugar barons opting to set up private sugar units despite overwhelming support of shareholders for the cooperative model is alarming. This, when the entire country is looking to emulate the Maharashtra sugar cooperatives model.Steps to control retail sugar prices  such as like putting stock limits on millers and wholesale traders, capping of retail prices, increased cess and non-payment of export incentives  succeed in providing relief to consumers even though they impact the earnings of millers. In a similar manner, identifying and effectively implementing steps to protect farmers interests is the need of the hour. The provisions of the Maharashtra Regulation of Sugarcane Price (Supplied to Factories) Act, 2013, enacted on the recommendation of the C. Rangarajan committee, may provide an effective instrument for the administration to limit H&T cost per ton of sugar cane and dwindling sugar recovery rate of the private sector in the State.Rajagopal Devara is serving Secretary, Government of Maharashtra, and former Sugar Commissioner, Maharashtra.

The outgoing governor said that part of the agenda for his remaining 28 days in office was to tweak the way banks calculate their benchmark rates so that borrowers will benefit.According to Kotak Mahindra Bank president Shanti Ekambaram, the highlight of the policy was the commitment to adequate liquidity and an assurance that the money would come up front through buyback of government bonds. ""This has already resulted in market yields falling sharply,"" she said.Rajan also accused banks of finding reasons to not pass on reductions in their borrowing costs. ""Earlier, some bankers said that it was the lack of liquidity that was holding rates high. Now I hear from some that it is fear of the FCNR(B) redemptions that is making them reluctant to cut rates. I have a suspicion that some new concern will crop up once the FCNR(B) redemptions are behind us,"" the governor said. He added that he expected banks to cut benchmark lending rates when public sector banks - after their bad loan clean-up - start competing to lend to corporates.A status quo policy was widely expected. A small section of bond dealers hoped for a rate cut since most of earlier concerns - such as Brexit, monsoon uncertainty - had abated. Also, it was felt by many that the RBI had only a small window of opportunity to experiment with lower rates as the implementation of GST would cause an increase in prices.Explaining the rational for holding rates, Rajan said it was inflation driven by food prices. Not just vegetables, prices of commodities such as sugar are also higher than usual due to a decline in domestic production. Rajan pointed out that while vegetable prices could come down, prices of pulses have been rising again since April after a short-lived correction in the previous quarter. Besides food prices, the governor was concerned that implementation of the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) will push up housing inflation."

Addressing a 'Khaat Sabha' during his UP Kisan Yatra, Rahul said, ""Farmers in our country are committing suicide. They want to move from villages to cities. For them, the most important means of transport is the Indian rail. They can only travel by train.""Hammering away for the third consecutive day at the theme of poor farmers versus rich industrialists, and the Modi government's tilt towards the latter-Rahul's constant refrain during his UP Kisan Yatra-he added, ""Farmers don't have private jets. Narendra Modi ji says he runs a government of the poor. If that is true, why has he increased the railway fare so much? On the one hand, you waive loans of rich industrialists, on the other, you don't even compensate poor farmers for their farm losses, don't deliver on the promise of jobs, and also fail to increase MSP.""Repeatedly attacking Prime Minister Modi at every meeting since he began his month-long farmer outreach from Deoria on September 6, Rahul said again that the 'globe-trotting PM' should also look after the welfare of the poor and the farmers in the country.""Hum Modiji ko batana chahte hain ki thoda sa dhyaan wo Hindustan ki gareeb janata ko bhi de dein. Zaroor pradhan mantri ko Obama ji se galey milna hota hai, haath milana hota hai, par Hindustan mein gareeb bhi hain, yuva bhi hain, kisan bhi hain, mazdoor bhi hain, unki bhi madad honi chahiye.""In an interactive session with the local farmers who complained of unpaid sugarcane dues, sugar mills shutting down, joblessness and high input costs, Rahul said, ""Sugar mills in this region were set up by the Congress. I give you an assurance from this stage that if the Congress comes to power, defunct sugar mills will be revived and you will get the cane dues that the mills owe you.""Urging the UP farmers to stand with the Congress, Rahul also tried to galvanise the farm community into demanding their rights. He said the UP farm community had the collective strength to ensure that once their written demand for a loan waiver package reached the PM, the government would be forced to announce a package for farmers.On Thursday, Rahul also attempted to clear the air on the Congress's Brahmin outreach, and tried to allay fears that the party, through its choice of Sheila Dikshit as CM face, was not trying to project itself as a party of one caste or community.""I want to assure you that while Sheila ji may be the CM candidate for Congress, ours will be a government for all, where every caste and religion is represented equally,"" Rahul said. Rahul said, ""Modi ji made many promises he didn't kept. But one thing he did was to waive Rs 1.10 lakh crore in loans to his industry friends. We started a yatra from Deoria to delhi for three reasons. Because we want to tell Modiji that if you can waive loans for the rich, then you must also waive loans for the farmers.

Although obesity dominates the national discussion on childhood health, many parents are also worried that their childs preferred diet of nuggets and noodles could lead to a nutritional deficit.Fussiness about food is a normal part of a childs development. Young children are naturally neophobic  they have a distrust of the new. Even the most determined parents can be cowed by a childs resolve to eat nothing rather than try something new. As a result, parents often give in, deciding that a bowl of Cocoa Puffs or a Pop-Tart, while not ideal, must be better than no food at all.For a varied dietA series of simple meal-time strategies can help even the pickiest eater learn to like a more varied diet. Heres a look at six common mistakes parents make when feeding their children.Sending children out of the kitchen. With hot stoves, boiling water and sharp knives at hand, it is understandable that parents dont want children in the kitchen when theyre making dinner. But studies suggest that involving children in meal preparation is an important first step in getting them to try new foods.Pressuring them to take a bite. Demanding that a child eat at least one bite of everything seems reasonable, but its likely to backfire.Studies show that children react negatively when parents pressure them to eat foods, even if the pressure offers a reward.The better approach is to put the food on the table and encourage a child to try it. But dont complain if she refuses, and dont offer praise if she tastes it. Just ask her if she wants some more or take seconds yourself, but try to stay neutral.Keeping good stuff out of reach. Parents worry that children will binge on treats, so they often put them out of sight or on a high shelf. But a large body of research shows that if a parent restricts a food, children just want it more.The lesson for parents? Dont bring foods that you feel the need to restrict into the house. Instead, buy healthful snacks.DietingDieting in front of your children. Kids are tuned into their parents eating preferences and are far more likely to try foods if they see their mother or father eating them.Serving boring vegetables. Calorie-counting parents often serve plain steamed vegetables, so its no wonder children are reluctant to eat them. Nutritionists say parents shouldnt be afraid to dress up the vegetables. Adding a little butter, ranch dressing, cheese sauce or brown sugar to a vegetable dish can significantly improve its kid appeal.Giving up too soon. A researcher said she has often heard parents say, My kid would never eat that. While it may be true right now, she noted that eating preferences often change. So parents should keep preparing a variety of healthful foods and putting them on the table, even if a child refuses to take a bite. In young children, it may take 10 or more attempts over several months to introduce a food.Sibling dynamics and friendships can also change a childs eating habits. Dr. Leann Birch of Penn State noted that her first child was always willing to try new foods, but that her second child was not.  New York Times News Service"

With no managerial experience it had been a very optimistic appointment at best and they ended up being relegated. ""I am hurting. I am raw, I take my share of the blame I thought I could save them in those eioght games,"" he said.Brian Clough - Leeds United (44)The best manager England never had for many, 'Old Big Head' took on the unenviable task of managing Leeds in the post Don Revie era, when the latter had become national team boss. He entered a veritable vipers nest as immortalised in the book and then the film version of David Peace's 'Damned United'. A strong character he met with similar individuals at Leeds and there was going to be only one casualty. Seven games and just one win and poisoned relations saw him shown the door with his ambitions of winning the European Cup with them and getting one up on Revie shattered. ""Did I say the European Cup? I hardly lasted long enough to be given my own teacup at Leeds,"" he joked in his autobiography. He had the last laugh in guiding unfashionable Nottingham Forest to two European Cup victories.John Toshack - Wales (41)Former Liverpool and Wales great he was a popular choice when appointed national team coach in 1994. It took just 90 minutes and a defeat to Norway to turn the cheers to jeers and he was gone.

The factory will run without any hindrance if the crop is planted right now as it takes 10 months for the harvest.On the other hand pressure from different sections has been increasing on the Government to announce its stand on the future of the factory. Former Minister and Congress senior leader P. Sudarshan Reddy led the padayatra covering five mandals last month on the demand. It evoked a good response from farmers who expressed their willingness to plant the crop if the factory management gives them assurance to crush the cane.Telangana Joint Action Committee under the leadership of its chairman Prof. M. Kodandaram planned padayatra from Bodhan to Nizamabad from November 2. However, it postponed its programme to another date in the month. The NSF Protection Committee called for Bodhan bandh with the demand for reopening of the factory tomorrow.People are eagerly waiting for the Governments decision on the NSF and are of the opinion that if it does not take a decision in this month the issue should be considered as kept in cold storage once for all. Reports said that if the statement comes for the factory reopening farmers are likely to plant sugarcane in 6,000 acres with available seed cane in the area. Thus, in the first year it would meet at least half of the quantity of cane which is required for crushing. Local leaders have no hopes of the immediate revival of the factory as it involves a big amount."

Experts have also issued warnings that this disruption in the sleep-wake cycle may cause long-term problems.Players, however, argue that it's just a thrilling game and doesn't necessarily have to be looked at so negatively.Avid player Sarjana Singh said, ""When I was young, we used to play with Pokemon cards, but that was never really satisfying. With this, I actually feel like I'm catching a Pokemon. It's thrilling. Just like Potterheads rue not receiving their Hogwarts acceptance letter, we used to whine about not being able to catch Pokemons.""Doctors warn that the phone's game screen emits a blue light, which suppresses melatonin the hormone that controls the sleep-wake cycle. This makes our brain believe it is still day time even when it is night, they said.Endocrinologist and sleep specialist A G Unnikrishnan of Chellaram Diabetes Institute, said, ""Research has proven that looking at a bright screen for long causes melatonin suppression. This will disrupt your sleep-wake cycle and delay your bed-time, starting a chain of events. Insufficient sleep leads to stress and that leads to a whole lot of problems.""Youngsters are not concerned about this potential harm. Many of them feel that if it's not Pokemon Go, something else would have kept them hooked to their phones at all odd hours.Shashank Nair, a 23-year-old player, said, ""I get back from office around 9pm. The only get to play the game is after that. Indeed, I have begun sleeping a couple of hours later than I used to but I feel like I'm exercising and having fun, so I don't see the harm.""Law student Pritish Oak agrees with Nair. The 24-year-old said, ""Even if I do end up eating late at night, I burn the calories by walking around the city while playing the game. So I see it as a win-win situation. As for my bed time being delayed, it's a small sacrifice for the immeasurable pleasure of revisiting one's childhood.""Pune university's Another fan of Pokemon Go who wasn't discouraged by the potential health risks of playing the game is 24 year Pune University law student Pritish Oak.Pokemon Go haters caution that the app also threatens an individual's privacy. All information linked to your Google account, including emails, pictures, documents and contacts can be accessed by Nintendo.This is not a deterrent to many, however, as almost all websites and apps today access the user's personal information. ""I don't mind that playing Pokemon Go means all my private information is sent to Nintendo. All websites anyway track our internet usage so this isn't that big a deal. Pokemon Go lets me feel young again,"" said 23-year-old professional Annujj Palaye.Doctors say that another indirect effect of Pokemon Go could be obesity and malnutrition.Cortisol levels in our body decrease naturally at night. Cortisol is the hormone that tells the liver to release sugar into the blood. This happens because we don't need much energy at night and is a signal to the body that it is time to sleep. But since the person stays awake at night due to suppression of melatonin, he has to compensate for the drop in blood sugar by eating food, experts say.Eye surgeon Anita Joseph of Columbia Asia Hospital said, ""Looking at any electronic screen for too long causes the tears in our eyes to dry up. We stop blinking as a result. This can cause discomfort, itching and headache.""Video game addiction is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with. Mukta Puntambekar, deputy director of Muktangan rehabilitation centre, said, ""Video games have a hypnotizing effect. People lose control of their bodies if they play video games for too long.

Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and MP Raju Shetti slammed the government for deciding to postpone the crushing season saying that it would affect farmers as well as sugar factories.On Thursday, Shiv Sena leaders demanded that all the sugar factories start sugarcane crushing from November 1. They have also threatened to launch an agitation if the government fails to take a decision in this regard.Shiv Sena district unit head Vijay Devane said, ""The decision taken by the panel of ministers to start crushing season from December 1 is wrong. Though there is decline in the cultivation of sugarcane in the state this year, Kolhapur has recorded almost same cultivation as compared to last year.""""We have received information that the sugar factories from Karnataka that were planning to start crushing season from November 15 have now decided to start it earlier. They will keep an eye on the sugarcane producers from talukas along Karnataka boundary, which will affect sugar industry in Kolhapur,"" he added.The farmers that had planted sugarcane in August 2015 were hoping to send their produce to factories by October-end. If crushing is delayed, the farmers will not benefit. ""There are chances of increasing recovery of sugarcane, but the weight of crop will be reduced, hence farmers will get less returns and factories will earn maximum profit. The state government should change its decision and permit sugar factories to start crushing from November 1,"" he said.A delegation of Shiv Sena met Sachin Rawal, joint director of sugar commissionerate, Kolhapur on Thursday and presented a memorandum of their demands. The party has threatened to start agitation in Kolhapur if the government decision is not changed soon."

The factories collectively owe Rs. 900 crore to the banks.Following the meeting, State Co-operation Minister Subhash Deshmukh told mediapersons that the government is positive about helping the sugar industry. The industry is in trouble because of consecutive years of drought. The sugar mills have to repay loans of around Rs. 1,000 crore to banks. The State government will form a committee to decide on the restructuring of loans, Mr. Deshmukh said.According to an estimate, consecutive years of drought have ensured that only 99 co-operative sugar factories were functional in 2015-16, of which barely 30 to 40 may begin the crushing season this year due to a shortage of sugarcane.During 2013-14 and 2014-15, around 134 co-operative sugar factories received loans worth Rs. 3,273 crore. Instalments worth Rs. 1,000 crore are due this year. The governments decisions including capping stocks of sugar, relaxing the mandatory sugar export rule and 20 per cent export duty on sugar has led to a fall in sugar prices.Mr. Deshmukh said the delegation demanded the sugar stock cap be lifted. The State government will be requesting the Centre for the same, he said.The Maharashtra State Co-op Sugar Factories Federation Limited (MSCSFF) had claimed sugar units in Marathwada are the worst-hit as only four of 62 such units managed to begin the sugarcane crushing season."

58f6c1cda3d24b0b70c2e9fa,When the river weeps,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/When-the-river-weeps/article14983472.ece,2016-09-21,"Agitations over the distribution of water in the Cauvery river are not new or surprising given the extreme dependence on agricultural and economic activity in the river basin. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are fighting over water in a drying river, paying little attention to framing long-term solutions.South India has always been highly dependent on the monsoon, which is uncertain and risky. Over the past few decades, the south-west monsoon has become unpredictable and has reduced in intensity. What does this mean for the Cauvery? The amount of water the river receives during the summer rains is becoming increasingly unreliable. In good years, when the river receives enough rainfall, there is no discord between the two States. In bad years, like the one we are facing now, it turns into a gargantuan political crisis. Unfortunately, the number of bad years is only going to worsen.Land useThe Cauvery rivers fertile basin has encouraged the growth of forests, agriculture and industry, all of which coexist in an uneasy manner and are now threatened. We need to pay attention to land use at the regional level. Dense forest cover once helped reduce the likelihood of flash flooding, retaining water on hill slopes to enable slow percolation and recharge of the tributaries. Deforestation across the basin has contributed to reduction in rainfall, soil erosion, and flooding, with hundreds of thousands of trees being decimated to make way for plantations, urban construction, and agriculture. In the place of forests, plantations of water-hungry trees such as eucalyptus and acacia are further reducing the water table. In Coorg, local groups have agitated against the felling of lakhs of trees for the construction of a new railway line from Mysuru, and a high-tension power line. They have received little support from the local and national administration despite warning of the effect on the river. These are not isolated incidents; deforestation is widespread along the length and breadth of the river. Tree clearing is now threatening even previously protected sites on mountain heights and steep slopes, sensitive zones where soil erosion further impacts river recharge.Rapid urbanisation has converted fertile agriculture, forests and wetlands into concreted areas that are unable to retain rainwater or channel them into tributary streams that feed the Cauvery. Urbanisation demands concrete; concrete requires sand. In the districts surrounding the Cauvery, rampant sand mining has altered the natural topography of the river, eroding its banks, widening the river, and altering water flow patterns. Despite warnings from environmentalist groups and farmer coalitions, and interventions by the court, this practice continues unchecked. It is no surprise that the wells that replenish farms across the basin are running dry  or that desperate farmers are reduced to abandoning agriculture and renting their farms to sand contractors for sand storage, thus becoming complicit in their own destruction.The large number of dams across the river contribute to a significant decrease in the rivers capacity for water storage. Siltation in dams and connecting river channels has reached alarming proportions. Industries along the Cauvery and its tributaries send large volumes of polluted water that, far from being of use to farmers, destroy their land beyond redemption. There is no farming activity for kilometres on the side of tributaries such as the Noyyal, polluted by Tiruppurs textile industry. The toxic sludge from industrial effluents builds up on the river bed, further reducing its capacity for storage. Despite abundant discussion, government funding for de-siltation of the rivers channels remains conspicuous by its absence.Changes in agricultural patternsWidespread changes in farming and agricultural patterns exacerbate the problem. Once an area of millet cultivation, the Cauvery basin has transformed into a location for the cultivation of high-yield paddy and sugar cane, both water-intensive crops. There needs to be a redesign of the farming system, keeping in mind in particular the water requirements of the crops planted after the onset of the south-west monsoon.What are Karnataka and Tamil Nadu planning to do in terms of developing more water-smart agricultural strategies? There is little discussion on this. Though a politically charged topic, it is one that must be addressed through conversations with farmers who seem well aware of these issues. They need better alternatives and greater state assistance in facilitating explorations of alternative cropping strategies, including an examination of a possible return to millet farming (which is more nutritious as well as water-efficient), or to multi-cropping of vegetables, or even to the development of more water-efficient varieties of paddy.While Karnataka and Tamil Nadu struggle to find workable solutions to the distribution of water in the river during years of drought, the writing on the wall is clear. As climate change makes its impact visible, we are going to face many more seasons of drought and points of conflict. It is important that we think long term and in a coordinated fashion across the basin. We need to find ways to recharge the river, increase inflow of water, clean up hotspots of pollution, and increase the efficiency of water use. For this, we must take up afforestation along the river on a war footing, move to water-efficient cropping, limit industrial pollution of rivers, ban excessive sand mining, and limit the growing consumption of water for cities and towns along the river. This requires conversation and cooperation across the basin, not reactive conflict. Given the politically charged minefield that the Cauvery water-sharing issue has become, can we hope for reasoned, concerted action?Harini Nagendra is a Professor of Sustainability at Azim Premji University.We need to find ways to recharge the Cauvery, increase inflow of water and efficiency of water use, and clean up hotspots of pollution"

No serious adverse effects were noted, Dr. Urooj noted.If any negative effects were seen, it was in those who over-indulge in food after Iftar (breaking of fast) or do not sleep well at night., she said. However, Dr. Urooj cautioned people with Type 1 diabetes against fasting. The medical condition of persons with Type 1 diabetes may worsen if they fast, she added. Also, she said fasting might be hazardous to persons suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. Researches on fasting and its effects on digestive disorders report that Ramzan fasting seems to increase peptic ulcer complications.On lipid profileReferring to improvement in blood lipid profile, Dr. Urooj cited a study conducted in 1997 in the Annals of Nutrition Metabolism that demonstrated fasting lowered bad LDL cholesterol by eight per cent, triglyceride by 30 per cent and increased good HDL by 14.3 per cent, thereby protecting the heart from cardiovascular diseases. This is explained by the eating habits, she said adding that people tend to go for healthier options such as dates, nuts, lentil soup and home cooked meals.On blood pressureDr. Urooj also said persons with mild to moderately high blood pressure along with being overweight are encouraged to fast as fasting may help lower their blood pressure.But, she said such persons should consult their physicians to adjust the medicine. For example, the dose of diuretics should be reduced to prevent dehydration, she said. Fasting lowers blood glucose and insulin levels, causing breakdown of glycogen from liver to provide glucose for energy needs and breakdown of fat for energy needs. Diabetics, who are controlled by diet alone, can fast and hopefully with weight reduction, their diabetes may even be treated and improved.But, diabetics, who are taking oral hypoglycemic agents along with diet, should exercise extreme caution if they decide to fast. They should consult their physician regarding the drug time and dosage, preferably take the drug with Iftar in the evening. Diabetics taking insulin should fast under the close medical supervision and make suitable changes in the insulin dose, she said.Dr. Urooj also emphasised the need for consulting a nutritionist to select the right food ingredients, particularly sources of carbohydrates, proteins and fats to produce the lente effect (sustained release of nutrients).She emphasised the need to monitor blood sugar level before breaking the fast and after Iftar . If blood sugar is less than 70 mg/dl, one may feel dizzy, trembling, palpitations, sweaty and tired/fatigued. If these symptoms are present, they may have to break the fast by taking fruit juice or glucose drink and follow it up with a snack/small meal after 10 to 15 minutes. Never ignore warning of hypoglycemia, she said.Fasting has a positive impact on ones blood glucose level, blood pressure, lipid profile and weight.Asna Urooj,Chairperson, Department of Studies in Food Science and Nutrition, UoM"

In Belagavi district, which has the highest number of sugar mills in Karnataka, Rs.132 crore was due for 2013-14, Rs. 58 crore for 2014-15, and Rs. 545 crore for 2015-16.Mr. Shanthkumar said that the sugarcane cultivation for 2016-17 had come down by 40 per cent of the target. As of now more than 2 lakh tonnes of cane had dried due to two consecutive drought years in Bidar and other parts of the State.The failure of the Congress and the Opposition parties to ensure that sugarcane dues were paid to the growers had forced them to shift to other crops.He said that the government must implement the State Advisory Price Act and direct sugar mills to share their profits on a 70:30 ratio between growers and mills. Sugar prices had gone up to Rs.3,500 to Rs.4,000 per quintal in the market.Mr. Shanthkumar urged the Centre to include sugarcane crop under the Prime Ministers Fasal Bima Yojana.He said that the Centre had done injustice to the growers by retaining the preceding FRP of Rs. 2,300 a tonne of sugarcane at 9.5 per cent recovery and an additional Rs. 246 per tonne for every additional increase of one per cent of recovery for 2016-17. The Centre, considering the plight of farmers, should increase it to at least Rs. 2,800 and Rs. 300, respectively, Mr. Shanthkumar added."

Natarajan here on Friday, S. Sathiah, secretary of the society, said NABARD had helped with a financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 to train 30 women members of the society in making jaggery at Kavakulam in Kadaladi block.Though palm jaggery made of neera, the palm nectar extracted from inflorescence of toddy palms, contained nutritious and medicinal values, it could not be marketed well for various reasons. To promote the sale of palm jaggery, the society had decided to add value to the product after tying up with NABARD, he said.Neera was filtered and processed for making value-added jaggery, comprising dry ginger, coconut, cardamom, groundnut, sesame and green gram. The product could be directly consumed by people of all ages, he said, adding it was an ideal substitute for sugar and served as medicine for diabetic patients.We proposed to train more women members in making jaggery and help them earn additional income, Mr. Sathiah said. The production would start after the season begins in February next year and about 300 kg of value-added jaggery could be made in a day. It was priced at Rs. 300 per kg and commanded a good demand in market, he added.Expressing concern over indiscriminate felling of palm trees in the district as well as in others parts of the State, Mr. Sathiah urged the Collector to come out with a scheme to protect palm trees. There were about six crore palm trees in the State and one crore in the district, and during the last five years, at least 50 lakh trees in the State, including 10 lakh in the district, would have been felled, he said.Village Administrative Officers and Tahsildars could be sensitised to the importance of protecting the State Tree on the lines of protecting teak, red sanders and sandalwood trees, he suggested.The society, on its part, had planted about 55,000 trees in the coastal areas of Pudumadam, Kalimangundu, Karan and Idumori in the district since 2008-09, he added."

According to them, the situation in both Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts was worst with lack of opportunities after the State division two years ago.They are insisting allocation of Rs.10, 000 crores for each district to ensure overall development and creation of job opportunities. CPI (M) has been organising meetings exclusively to highlight the issues in a systematic way. As many as eight lakh acres of land will get irrigation facility if Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanti project is taken up by constructing lift irrigation project on the Godavari near Purushothapatnam. Vizianagaram alone can get water for 3.94 lakh acres.MLC M.V.S. Sarma and CPI(M) Vizianagaram district secretary Tammineni Suryanarayana said the State government should not ignore these two districts since the Union government had also mentioned their backwardness in AP Reorganisation Act. The State government allocates funds generously for Pattiseema and other projects. But it allocates meagre funds for projects like Thotapalli, Vengalaraya Sagar, and Chintigedda, they added.Closure of factoriesLok Satta Party State general secretary Bhisetty Babji expressed concern over the closure of many factories including jute and sugar industries. Hundreds of workers are unable to get livelihood with the closure of medium size industries, leave alone about establishment of new major industries in Vizinagaram and Srikakulam. The government should extend its helping hand for the revival of the sick industries, he said.Industrialist and Vasavi Club International former Governor Perla Mahesh said that Srikakulam can attract more investments if more incentives were given under special category status.Pratyeka Hoda Sadhana Samiti leader G. Narsu Naidu said that even development was needed for the State as many people were not happy with Amaravati-centric growth. Real development will be possible in backward Sriakkulam district only when the Union government sanctions special status. Establishment of rail zone in Visakhapatnam, High Court Bench in Visakhapatnam and extension of coastal corridor will benefit the region immensely, he added.Agro-based industriesCPI leader Chapara Venkata Ramana alleged that the State government was allocating only pharmaceutical, thermal and atomic power plants to Srikakulam district although the people were agitating against them. As many as five lakh people migrated to other places. At least now, the government should try to create employment locally by establishing agro-based industries, he added.Uttarandhra Journalists Forum president M.R.N. Varma and General Secretary N. Nageswara Rao said that the Union government should fulfil its commitments given in the Reorganisation Act. Mere allocation of Rs.50 crore every year for each district does not serve the purpose, said Mr. Varma.Left parties, NGOs special focus is needed for the overall development of two backward districts"

VenkatachalapathyWith their plea to implement the Thenpennai-Palar river linking project remaining unfulfilled for over five years, a section of farmers decided to cover their mouth with black cloth as a sign of protest during the farmers grievance redressal meeting on Friday.A few farmers of the Palar Paadhukaapu Sangam and Thamizhaga Vivasaigal Sangam gagged their mouth with black cloth and held placards during the meeting that was chaired by Collector S. A. Raman. They sought an explanation from the district administration on when the Thenpennai  Palar river linking project would be implemented.We have been talking about the project for the last six to seven years but there seems to be no sign of implementation. Hence, we decided that we will not talk about it during this meeting and so gagged our mouth symbolically, A. C. Venkatesan, district secretary of Palar Paadukaappu Sangam said.The link project was initiated in 2008-2009 and envisages diverting flood water from Krishnagiri reservoir from Nedungal to Palar river basin via Kallaru through a link canal of nearly 54 km length.The Central government had approved this project nearly two years ago. It even noted that the State government should implement the project at its own cost as it was an intra-State project. The State government earlier announced it would allot funds if the Centre did not grant funds. But nothing has happened, he added.Farmers said that this project would breathe life into the bone dry Palar river. It would help in irrigating about 11,870 hectares of land, he added.It would bring water to several water bodies and recharge wells, thereby improving the ground water table, he said. The farmers wanted the Collector to send a recommendation to the government to implement the project.Grievance meeting:Rajaperumal, a farmer, said that groundnut crops in the district had poor yield and urged the district administration to study the situation in detail. Ekanathan, another farmer, said that the road work for a length of 3 km from Ambur to Naickaneri was pending. We have been raising the issue for five years. Though the Forest department had called for tenders, no work has been taken up. This work will help in establishing proper connectivity for 14 villages, he said.He also said that the Aanaimadagu dam is in dire need of desilting works. Sugarcane farmers lamented the delay in settling their dues. Kannaiah Naidu, a farmer, said the Vellore cooperative sugar mill was yet to pay Rs. 20 crore to farmers. Similar was the state with the cooperative mills at Ambur and Tirupattur.Officials, while replying to the grievance, said the funds to settle the dues had been sought from the government. While the Ambur mill has to pay Rs. 18 crore, the Tirupattur mill has to settle Rs. 6 crore dues to farmers, who had supplied cane for crushing."

With its huge financial resources, China probably has greater capacity to do it than India, said Exim Bank Chairman and Managing Director, Yaduvendra Mathur.Indias strength is in services, especially in sectors such as healthcare, information technology, education and even agriculture-related services. So we want to help in increasing Indias services exports to Africa.Greater sayThe change in approach follows the government giving a greater say to Exim Bank in identifying Indias best interests while it promotes economic diplomacy.Mr. Mathur  who is leaving for Africa to be there when President Pranab Mukherjee inaugurates Exim Banks office in Cote dIvoire (or Ivory Coast) on Tuesday  said as part of the new strategy, it is also important to encourage more Indians to move to Africa on short-term projects in services sectors.Exim Bank has been extending credit to Africa through concessional Lines of Credit, Buyers Credit (meant to finance imports of overseas buyers, in this case African buyers, from India) and through other lending mechanisms.Modis visitExim Banks new office in Ivory Coast is to service West Africa. It has an office in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) for the Eastern and Central African region, in addition to the one in Johannesburg to take care of the needs in Southern Africa.Exim Bank has set up Kukuza Project Development Company (KPDC) in Nairobi (Kenya), along with IL&FS Group, African Development Bank and State Bank of India, to ensure greater Indian participation in infrastructure projects in Africa.The aim now is to kick-start KPDCs operations by the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi undertakes his African visit in July covering Kenya, South Africa, Mozambique and Tanzania, Mr. Mathur said.Transmission linesExim Bank has extended around $300 million to finance the setting up of electric transmission lines in West Africa and is ready to give another $200 million for the same, he said. It is also helping African countries import vehicles and automobile equipments from India and in setting up of sugar factories.India-Africa goods trade in 2014 was around $75 billion with Africa exporting $40 billion to India and India exporting around $35 billion to that continent, according to International Trade Centre data.This had fallen to about $60 billion in 2015 with Africa exporting $34 billion and India exporting $26 billion, data showed."

""Earlier, I used to see one or two cases every few months. Now I see around five to six per month,"" he said.Patients develop additional problems, like gluten allergies, irregular stools and constipation, due to the high maida content and presence of preservatives and artificial flavouring in junk food.Balaji Jaganmohan, diabetologist, Apollo Sugar Clinics, Bengaluru, says, Junk food should come with a statutory warning just like tobacco and alcohol products do, saying that consumption of high-glycemic index, high calorie food, poses the risk of diseases like diabetes, hypertension and cholesterol."" Patients are coming in with diabetes and other lifestyle diseases at a much younger age, he further adds.He recommends eating fresh fruit and vegetables, and cutting down on eating outside.

The move comes after Congress leader Narayan Rane had told the House on Tuesday about an excise sub-inspector, who had died in a road accident in 2013, was transferred to a new posting this month without verification.Replying to Mr. Ranes allegations, Mr. Fadnavis acknowledged that an official who had died was indeed transferred erroneously by department. The department has an establishment board which examines and issues routine transfers. I admit that the lapse did take place, so I announce an inquiry by the Chief Secretary into whether the establishment followed the transfer norms, he said.The announcement came a day after the embarrassed government had suspended a clerk in the Kolhapur excise superintendents office, and served a show cause notice to the concerned superintendent for not informing the Excise Commissioners office about the demise of sub-inspector Sandip Sabale. Mr. Sabale was killed in a road accident on July 26, 2013, but was transferred from his posting at Daulat Cooperative Sugar factory in Kolhapur to the excise flying squad in Satana, Nashik.Government sources said over 180 excise officers were hurriedly transferred on July 2 and 3 in the period between BJP leader Eknath Khadses exit as revenue minister and assumption of office by his replacement, Chandrashekhar Bawankule.Though a clerk has been sacked, government sources said Mr. Sabales wife Varshas application for a job in the excise department on humanitarian grounds has been pending since October 2013 with the Joint Commissioner (Administration), who executed the transfers.Also under the cloud is reinstatement of excise superintendent Vijay Chinchalkar, who was shunted to a non-executive posting in Chandrapur, one of the prohibition districts, to an executive posting in Kolhapur. Similarly, Thane excise superintendent Manohar Anchule, who was trapped by the ACB while accepting a bribe of Rs. 18 lakh, has been reinstated with an executive posting in Dhule. According to General Administration Department norms, officers facing departmental inquiry for graft should be given non-executive postings.The repatriation of IPS officer B.G. Shekhar too is under a cloud. Mr. Shekhar was specially appointed as Director, Vigilance and Enforcement following a discussion in the state legislature in the aftermath of the June 2015 Malwani hooch tragedy, which killed 108 people.Lawmakers had felt that instead of an excise officer who may not have the requisite authority over the police, it would be more prudent to appoint an IPS officer to improve vigilance and on-the-ground co-ordination between excise and police to tackle illicit liquor production. Accordingly, Mr Shekhar was appointed to the post.Government sources said over 180 excise dept officers were hurriedly transferred on July 2 and 3"

They were the only health testing gadgets available at home. Now, there are a host of home-based testing kits, which include kits to test blood sugar and to confirm pregnancy too. These are easily available in pharmacies and even online. Most popular among them are glucometers.They came to the market about a decade ago and were priced at Rs. 6,000 a piece. It is now priced between Rs. 600 and Rs. 2,000. L. Panayappan, partner in a leading chain of pharmacies and a professor in pharmacy, said that glucometers priced around Rs. 1,500 come with in-built memory and can store more than 25 previous readings. According to him the strips used for tests was a bigger market, compared to glucometers. Some companies even offer glucometers free of cost with a purchase of about 50 strips, he said. Some local companies are importing glucometers and offer it at a competitive price, but reliability of the readings from these kits would have to be verified.Next in demand is blood pressure monitors. They are priced between Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 3,500. There are incidents of inaccuracy in readings at home and complaints of higher readings compared to hospital. Mr. Panayappan said that it was primarily because hospitals ask patients to relax for 10 minutes before testing pressure. At home people check pressure level when they are stressed. Hence, the difference.Demand is also high for the use-and-throw pregnancy confirmation kits that are priced between Rs. 40 and Rs. 100. They are mostly used as a first level confirmation before going to the hospital.Dean of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital A. Edwin Joe said that patients are the most benefited from these home-based testing kits. Glucometers at home help patients know their sugar level and change their diet habits and keep their health in good shape. Though there is minor variation in blood sugar or pressure level, it is usually negligible, he added.Reporting byM.K. Ananth"

Small time instant photographers are like ants; only that they follow not sugar or jaggery but large crowds.The milling crowds at the Pushkarams bathing ghats in city have attracted a few small time instant photographers who are here to make some extra buck.Equipped with a printer that is compact and portable, these photographers move around the ghats pictures of the pilgrims taking a holy dip in the river.Though most pilgrims are digitally connected and carry their mobile phones, but the fact that they cannot use them in water while taking a dip comes in handy for them to fill the gap.Their shooting device is a combination of user-convenience and performance which enables printing of the photograph at a high speed  all of two minutes to be precise.Adigillu Suribabu, a native of Mulapet in Kothapalli mandal of East Godavari district, is one such photographer who is making the best of the floating crowd at the ghats.

Local BJP MLA Manda Mhatre has also launched an attack on the officer, who has barely completed three months in office. I am not saying he is a bad officer. But I must say he should take people of the area into consideration before taking action, Ms. Mhatre had earlier said.The Opposition Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is ruling the NMMC, has, however, decided to wait and watch.Mr. Mundhe, on the other hand, says he is just going by the book. I have been doing my duty and following the law. It is possible that people do not like the way I work and may find me strict. But I have to do my duty and I will continue to do so, he said.Mr. Mundhe, who was posted as the Solapur collector prior to this, had his fair share of critics there as well. While water conservation activists gave him credit for reducing the number of water tankers used in the district during the recent drought-like situation, politicians protested against his policies, saying they hurt the interests of sugar factories. Such was the discontent against him in the political leadership that the districts guardian minister Vijay Deshmukh himself joined the protest demanding his ouster.I am not blaming any political party or leader. They are doing their work and I am doing mine. If there are some problems, those can be solved by mutual understanding between the two sides, said Mr. Mundhe.His challenge is to motivate the administration to work as per the rules, he said. I have been observing problems in several departments of the corporation such as land use, building permission, etc. We are working on them and making the process more systematic, he said.In the past three months, the corporation has taken action against over 15,906 hawkers; 287 buildings for encroachments, 1,412 slums; 30 religious places and 1,994 illegal banners and hoardings, as per NMMC data.Action against illegal dumping of debris alone has helped NMMC earn over Rs. 46.97 lakh."

The farmers alleged that the Perambalur Sugar Factory at Eraiyur owed Rs.33 crore as arrears to cane growers who had supplied sugarcane to the factory during the 2015-16 crushing season. Similarly, the Arignar Anna Sugar Mills in Kurunkulam in Thanjavur district also owed huge sums as arrears to cane growers.The State government, the farmers demanded, should intervene and ensure the payment of arrears to the cane growers. The agitators also demanded that all private sugar mills should be directed to pay arrears to the cane growers immediately.The farmers also urged the State government to convene tripartite talks to discuss and fix the State Advised Price for sugarcane for the 2016-17 crushing season.Alleging that machines at the Perambalur Sugar Factory were in poor condition, the farmers urged the government to take steps to execute the modernisation and cogeneration plant programme on a war footing.The Centre should fix the price of agriculture produce as per the recommendations of M. S. Swaminathan Committee providing for 50 per cent profit over and above the cost of production, they urged.N. P. Anbazhagan, president, Sugarcane Growers Association, presided over the agitation. R. Raja Chidambaram, state secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, Swamimalai Vimalanathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, and members of various other cane growers associations participated."

He also posted two tweets on the limits imposed. The decision aims to increase the supplies in the market, in a bid to keep a check on the price of sugar.Most mills holding their stocks will now be forced to sell their inventories in the market."

A recent study on published in Diabetes Care has indicated that innovation is required to treat a specific category of people with impaired fasting glucose, on whom regular interventions are not effective.While arguing that systematic diabetes prevention in people with pre-diabetes could effectively reduce incidence by a third in the community, the paper goes on to state that people with impaired fasting glucose may require a different set of interventions. A collaboration between Emory University and the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF), the D-CLIP paper is based on a study over three years of over 600 people with pre-diabetes in Chennai.No large diabetes prevention trial has compared the effects of diabetes prevention strategies across the pre-diabetes spectrum, the paper claims. Ranjani Harish, of MDRF, and co-author said, We are the first group to replicate the most successful U.S. Diabetes Prevention Programme, by culturally adapting their lesson plans to an Indian setting and used that model to study diabetes prevention.Broadly speaking, the categories in the pre-diabetic stage are Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG), Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) and a combination of IFG and IGT.Lifestyle modificationsThe trial sought to measure the impact of a mix of lifestyle modifications, exercise and a dose of metformin, an anti-diabetes drug, (for those who failed to respond to lifestyle changes alone), among patients in preventing progression to diabetes.It was found that in the IFG group, people still moved to diabetes irrespective of the regimen they were put on.Mary Beth Weber, of the Emory Global Diabetes Research Centre, Emory University, Atlanta, says, Researchers in our group and elsewhere are still trying to understand why this is, but it might be due to the fact that some individuals develop a condition called beta cell dysfunction earlier than others. Beta cells are the cells in your pancreas that make insulin, the hormone that signals cells in your body that there is glucose  or sugar  in your blood. If the beta cells are not working well, they may not make enough insulin to clear the glucose from your blood stream. For these individuals, exercise and diet change may not be sufficient.Following a healthy diet, one that is rich in fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, low in sugar, and includes healthy fats; exercising at a moderate level for at least 150 minutes per week; and not smoking or using tobacco products are known to reduce diabetes risk.In fact, R.M. Anjana of MDRF, says these changes did have a good preventive effect on the combined IFG and IGT group.Different groups in pre-diabetic state need specific interventions and strategies"

Vaithilingam, who has quietly ascended the AIADMK party hierarchy in the past few months, is going round his Orathanad constituency soliciting support to strengthen his hold over the region.Such is his stranglehold that the original DMK candidate S.S. Rajkumar, brother of the once-powerful former Union Minister of State and DMK regional satrap S.S. Palanimanikkam simply withdrew his candidature putting the opposition party in a fix.The Minister has been able to infuse confidence into his electorate as his delivery of promises indicates.Definitely he has transformed the predominantly rural Orathanad constituency into something of an urban shadow by bringing in some governmental offices, TANUVAS and TNAU education and research institutes, besides shoring up the constituency with roads, highways and basic amenities such as underground sewerage system, industrial training institute and the like.Besides his clout with party boss and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, what helps Mr. Vaithilingam is his social stratification background as Kallars form the majority community in the constituency.Of course, Agamudayars, Dalits and others are present in significant numbers.Mr. Vaithilingam has won the constituency three times since 2001 and that he was able to put it across the DMK wave in 2006 speaks of the support he has among the people.He knows the constituency like the back of his palm and has been able to connect with his electorate.It will be Mr. Vaithilingam this time too, says rat trap maker A. Gunasekaran (50) of Madigai.He has done a lot for the constituency and for several individuals who have sought help from him.Though I have not benefited, I believe that the various development and welfare schemes he has brought in would help him retain the seat, Mr. Gunasekaran who lost a leg due to amputation recently notes.If Mr. Vaithilingam is trying to ride on his deliverance and the AIADMKs poll manifesto, the DMK overcoming the initial shock of Mr. Rajkumars withdrawal has fielded the former MLA and the immensely popular bullet M. Ramachandran who is seen as a down to earth person and a good choice to give the Minister a run for his money.Mr. MR, as he is called by acquaintances, is a friendly and accessible person, easily walks into even very modest houses and mingles with the people in the region that he knows intimately.Of course Mr. Vaithilingam has brought developments but his government has ruined poor peoples lives by easing the flow of liquor. Whatever our men earn during the day is lost in the evening at the TASMAC retail outlets.It is good that there is increased awareness on the need for prohibition.Throttling liquor flow is more important than development and welfare schemes and so I will support only the DMK that could effectively bring in prohibition, says vegetable vendor T. Saroja (52) of Chettymandapam near Kannanthangudi.Kannanthangudi is the native of former DMK MP L. Ganesan but his currency does not sell any longer in the region.There is significant support for the Minister in those areas as well.Despite some good works done by the Minister, there are still some issues concerning the people in the constituency.A separate taluk with Thiruvonam as the headquarters is a long pending demand. The power co-generation plant work proceeding at an excruciatingly slow pace at the Arignar Anna Sugar Mills at Kurungulam, coconut farmers needs, sugarcane growers procurement and payment problems and expeditious modernisation of the Grand Anicut Canal are exercising the minds of the people in the region.The Minister could have done his bit in all of them is the common refrain.A good fight is on the cards in Orathanad constituency between Mr. Vaithilingam and Mr. Ramachandran as other parties do not count much in the contest. However, the balance of power tilts towards the AIADMK in Orathanad."

Drinking water supply had been falling with every passing summer, due to the exponential growth of the city in the last two decades and increase in its population as well.The measure comes close on the heels of the city being selected for a five-year Smart City Project, which is set for implementation in a month or two.The project envisages 24 x 7 drinking water supply to all the 58 wards of the Belagavi City Corporation, though 10 wards already have the facility.CREDAI Belagavi president Quais Noorani told The Hindu that the entire community of Belagavi city and district were facing drinking water shortage in the last three years. The shortage has been more acute this year when compared to the earlier years. The decision to launch work to remove silt from the reservoir was taken in response to a call given by Regional Commissioner N. Jayaram, who during a meeting with representatives of industry, including sugar mills and other social organisations, convened to explore measures to improve drinking water supply situation in the city and district last week.Mr. Jayaram had appealed to the meeting to join hands with the government to clean water tanks, river and nala beds and other water sources.He said that five earthmovers were pressed into service by CREDAI. The Belagavi City Corporation provided around 10 tippers to shift the silt.More earthmovers and tippers could be expected from Wednesday, as farmers were being pursued to take away the silt, which was of red soil and very fertile for agricultural crops. He said that the dam was spread over an area of 850 acres and cleaning process would be expedited to remove as much silt as possible from the reservoir before the onset of monsoon.Silt accumulationAccording to Executive Engineer of Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board N. Prasanna Murthy, who quoting a report of the National Institute of Hydrology as saying, said that 4.80 per cent of the reservoirs storage capacity of about 0.58 tmcft was filled with silt since 1962 when the dam was constructed. The silt was not in the live storage area but mainly in the dead storage portion and below the intake level of the dam."

They will work through the Bidar-based College of Horticulture.Resource persons will train farmers in cultivation methods, protection of crops from pests and insects, post-harvest technologies and provide seedlings and other inputs. The farmers will also be exposed to the market for fresh fruits and fruit-based products. The National Research Centre for Banana will organise demonstrations in the fields of progressive farmers and organise lectures on the College of Horticulture premises here.As a first step towards this long-time association, a team, led by the centre director B. Padmanabhan, visited the College of Horticulture recently. They interacted with farmers, teachers and students in the college. They inspected facilities such as the post-harvest laboratory, the library, and the farms and green houses on the college premises.V. Kumar, a scientist, said that Bidars climate was apt for horticulture crops and encouraged farmers to try various types of bananas. It is best to start cultivation in a small area and increase it gradually, he said. He asked farmers to study the market and consult experts before taking up any new crop.R. Thangavelum, another scientist, said that the market for the Kamalapur red banana would grow further as consumers were slowly realising its health benefits.Dr. Padmanabhan pointed out that one of the mandates of the centre was to train farmers in advanced farming methods and to introduce the crop to non-traditional areas. He said that the geology and climate of Bidar and Kalaburagi were well suited for the crop. Temperatures ranging from 25-35 degrees Celsius are optimal for banana. Wind speeds below 40 kmph will protect the crops from falling, he said. This is just the beginning, we will keep coming, he said.Dr. Padmanabhan said that Bhagwant Khuba, MP, initiated this process by writing to the ICAR and the banana research institute. The MP wanted us to inspect the area to see if banana could be grown here and to train farmers, if possible, he said.V. Kumar and K.J. Jayabhaskaran were the other members of the team.Suraj Patil, a farmer from Kamalapur, asked farmers to pick banana over sugarcane. This has a ready-made market, has assured yields and frees you from the clutches of the sugar factories, he said.S.S. Baragimath, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, said that banana farms added up to 2,000 hectares in Bidar district. This can be increased gradually once farmers realise the benefits, he said. He pointed out that farmers could double their cultivable area by opting for drip irrigation, and increase productivity by 20-30 per cent. He said that banana needed 15-20 litres of water per day per plant that was slightly higher than sugarcane. He said that bananas had a large market potential as they could be sold anywhere.College of Horticulture scientists N. Srinivas and Vijayalakshmi P. were present."

The programme now covers around 40,000 residents.The college adopted 15 villages in Arakambakkam and began a weekly chronic diseases clinic in the college in 2003 for the management of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.Over the years, this initiative has grown  a village health empowerment training model was begun in 2012 which trained people on non-communicable diseases, reproductive health, adolescent health and basic life support. They were also trained to assess blood pressure, blood sugar and body mass index.From then on, health kiosks manned by trained volunteers were started in two villages for the early identification of diabetes and hypertension, and those with abnormal levels were referred to the community health centre. From 2013 to 2015, kiosks were set up in 9 villages. and the number of patients registered at the weekly clinic has gone up, thereby helping with early identification, monitoring and control of non-communicable diseases. A population of 13,779 is served by the kiosks.In 2015, breast and cervical cancer screening was initiated in eight villages based on prevalence studies. To support this, a cervical cancer screening unit was established at the college. The mental health department of the college developed a model for the integration of mental health in primary health care and weekly mental health wellness clinics too, were established in 2013.With these comparatively inexpensive village-level kiosks and screening programmes, we have been able to provide effective and efficient primary health care for NCDs, said K R Rajanarayanan, research co-ordinator at the college.The Omayal Achi College of Nursing has set up kiosks for non-communicable diseases"

The international prices of sugar are rising and therefore traders may increase the export of sugar to make profit, Mr.Paswan said... to keep the export of sugar in control, it is proposed to levy 25 per cent custom duty on export of sugar, Mr.Paswan said in a series of tweets.He added that this move will keep sufficient availability of sugar in domestic market and the price will be under control.According to trade sources, sugar exports have become viable now as global prices have increased by 50 per cent in last three months due to disruption in supply from Brazil.As demand and supply of sugar in India are at par, the government does not want any export from the country.The country had exported 1.4 million tonnes of sugar so far in the 2015-16 marketing year (OctoberSeptember).Retail sugar prices last month had crossed Rs.40 per kg due to 11 per cent fall in domestic sugar output in the ongoing 2015-16 season.Sugar production in India, the worlds second largest producer is estimated to be about 25 million tonnes in 2015-16, as against 28.3 million tonnes last year.

We persuade one, another takes his place. That makes me feel that people from the Aam Aadmi Party are just fanning the issue because they want to keep the issue alive. I want to tell them that Gujarat has a tradition, that it is a two-party State, a third party has no space. AAPwaaley Dilli sambhalein, idhar aaney ki aavashyakta nahin hain [AAP leaders should stay in Delhi, no need to come to Gujarat], she said.Secondly, the Congress is also interested in keeping the issue alive, because some people associated with it like Lalit Vasoya [head of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti in Saurashtra] and others are aspirants for tickets in 2017. They have told me that they need to keep the issue alive despite getting my point. Ms. Patel said she did not believe there would be a legal challenge to this order, since this was not a caste-specific measure.Daughter issueMs. Patel also blamed Congress leader Arjun Modhvadia for allegations that her daughter Anar Patels business partner got land at low rates near the Gir lion sanctuary. If my daughter is partner with someone in a business, and that person gets into business with someone else, how does that connect my daughter to the deals closed by that entity? Mr. Arjun Modhvadia had a business of sub-contracting works from big companies, some of these sub-contracts were discontinued. I had no hand in their discontinuation, but the canard was spread that I had and things were alleged against my daughter, she said.Social sectorMs. Patel, who became Chief Minister of Gujarat after Narendra Modi won the 2014 general elections and moved to Delhi, has concentrated on the social sector in the last two years, including a unique experiment in improving the nutritional status among children, which, she said would pay dividends in the future.The parameters set by the WHO [World Health Organization], those are for the whole world, a standardisation that doesnt take into account diversity of any sort, of lifestyle, or physical activity, muscle build-up or anything. We started a pilot project in Vadodara a year and a half ago, where we took on board both private and government doctors, anganwadi workers and helpers and others, and classified children into extremely malnutritioned, those who were malnutritioned but a little better off than the first category, and the last were those children who were not in need of any treatment.The children in the first category were admitted to hospital for a period of 21 days and then monitored from home. We came up with a formula, groundnuts, sugar and milk powder, which we made into a paste to boost the nutritional supplements in the body. That showed good results and now we have tied up with Amul [milk cooperative] to produce this paste. It is called Bal Amul and it will be packaged in a tetra box, and supplied to all children. Over 45 lakh children have been screened so far. We are going into at least 15 different districts, collate the results and we will present the report to WHO, who will, hopefully widen their definition of measuring malnutrition, she said.Ms. Patel also declared that the Sardar Sarovar Dam project would be completed six months ahead of schedule in March 2017, in a large measure because unlike Prime Minister Modi we didnt have to deal with a hostile Central government.(For full interview visit: thne.ws/26PsP4F )"

The British required a prison in Machilipatnam to incarcerate the local freedom fighters within the area of Krishna and Guntur districts and Nalgonda in Telangana State during the freedom struggle, local historian Mohammed Silar told The Hindu .According to available literature on Machilipatnam, it was the only prison to confine the freedom fighters until another prison was built in Vijayawada in early 1920s.Jaggery unitMasula History penned by Chitta Bala Krishna Sastry in 1922 predicts that Machilipatnam would witness rapid industrial activity, by citing the jaggery production unit set up in the British prison by then.After the British left the prison by early 1920s, local entrepreneur Jaldu Rama Rao obtained permission from the British to use the prison premises for production of jaggery and sugar, said Mr. Silar. However, sugar cane production had to be stopped by mid 1940s, owing to various business reasons.Currently, the British prison is owned by the family of Jaldu Rama Rao.Now, an old woman resides at the entrance of the site, which is yet to get the heritage status.Only if it gets the heritage status, any conservatory initiatives by the Archaeological Survey of India could be expected to take place.Another heritage structureIronically, the British prison is located opposite another heritage site which was a hospital during the Nizams period.The efforts made by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) for the conservation of the British prison as well as the other sites at Bandarkota have not yielded any results so far."

Venugopal, a long-time resident of Perambalur who had persistently raised this demand.The construction of this dam would substantially improve water table benefitting farmers even if the monsoon fails, he says.Deepening and dredging of water bodies, including the supply channels, has been a persistent demand of farmers which has not been done by successive governments, says Raja Chidambaram, State secretary of the Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam who is based in Perambalur.Although drought relief was provided to farmers when they faced crisis situation following failure of monsoon, many were yet to receive it, charge the farmers.Modernisation of millYet another demand of farmers especially cane growers is the modernisation of the sugar mill near Perambalur.Many cane growers were yet to receive payments from the mill, says Mr. Raja Chidambaram.Demands for a government-run fertiliser factory making use of the raw materials available in the constituency, a State-owned cotton mill that could provide employment to youth and expediting the construction of a reservoir across the Marudhaiyar are some of the other demands of the electorate.A slew of promisesIt is against this backdrop that the constituency is gearing up for yet another intense poll battle with political parties having set out on the field with a slew of promises and their achievements in a desperate bid to woo the electorate.The AIADMK which wrested the seat from the DMK in 2011 is banking on its five-year achievements, including the construction of the Viswakudi dam near Perambalur.The partys nominee and MLA Ilambai Tamizhchelvan is fighting hard to retain the seat. Giving him a stiff fight is bureaucrat-turned politician P. Sivakami, the founder of the Samuga Samathuva Padai contesting on the DMK symbol.Ms. Sivakami, on her maiden poll battle, is banking on the hard work of the functionaries of the DMK and its allies.The X factorThe entry of DMDK backed by its alliance partners including the two Left parties and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi has made the battle interesting.Ms. Sivakami, who belongs to Perambalur, has listed her priorities for the constituency, including self-employment for women and to carry forward the good works done by former Minister A. Raja. With a sizeable population of Dalits, the constituency has considerable presence of Udayars, Reddiars, Vanniyars, and Konars spread across the segment.Traditional rivalsOld timers in the constituency say the DMK has its own strong base in the constituency akin to its rival the AIADMK which has gone all out to retain the seat.Given the hold of the two main Dravidian parties, the stage is all set for a stiff contest in Perambalur.Farmers say the district leads in the State in the out of maze, onion and cotton"

A little bit of modification in the daily cooking will do the trick.If you think that tastier food can be prepared only by using liberal portions of cooking oil, Preethi Trivedi, Art of Living teacher from Mumbai, believes in a different theory.Her six-day-long cookery session held at Niranjan hall, Dondaparthy crafted a new menu that lists a variety of soups, vegetable salads, sandwich made of pulses and whole wheat flour cakes sans any artificial flavour and oil.Demonstrating how steamed dahi-vada can be made at the session on Saturday, Ms. Preethi says most of her recipes include less amount of cow ghee or oil. Steamed vegetables are any time a better option. The methods we follow while cooking play an imperative part in retaining nutrient value of the vegetables. Those who are used to fried food can switch to healthier menu without compromising much on taste. Replacing oil by little amount of cow ghee, sugar by jaggery or rock sugar are some of the options that can be considered while cooking. Similarly, there are many such natural supplements available to us to lead a healthier life, she says.Ms. Preethi says there is no hard and fast rule as far as cooking is concerned. Despite using abundant oil, she says certain recipes can turn out to be a mundane stuff. Creativity plays a vital role in cooking. Variations can be brought only if we keep experimenting with new ingredients, following safe cooking methods, says the AOL teacher.Those who attended the classes said the recipes learnt can be tried with other ingredients as well. For instance, I tried plantain paratha for the first time and it came out really well. Cooking will be interesting only if we bring in innovative elements to the process, says R. Sarada. Homemakers who were part of the session found the platform quite useful as it offered something new to their little ones."

PHOTO: M. GOVARTHANTamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam on Tuesday urged the State Government to waive agricultural loans and pursue Pandiyar-Punnapuzha Scheme in right earnest for solving the water needs in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode and Karur districts.At a discussion here chaired by the Sangams State president K. Venkatachalam, a resolution was adopted seeking waiver of agricultural loans, tractor loan, loan for digging wells and installing drip irrigation system. He said the support of the farmers to political parties hinges on their seriousness in implementing loan waiver.Mr. Venkatachalam urged the Central Government to nationalise all rivers and to link the peninsular rivers to start with.Procurement priceThe meeting called for increase in procurement price at the rate of Rs. 4,000 per tonne for sugarcane, Rs. 3,000 per quintal of paddy, Rs. 20,000 per quintal of turmeric, Rs. 15,000 per tonne of tapioca, and Rs. 150 per kg for copra.Likewise, cow milk must be procured for Rs. 40 per litre and buffalo milk for Rs. 50 a litre. The entire milk must be procured by the government and the insurance cover for cattle must be provided through the Animal Husbandry Department.The meeting also urged the Government to prevail upon private sugar mills to follow the practices of co-operative mills in making payments to farmers.The Government must permit killing of wild boars to protect crops, the farmers emphasised and sought adequate compensation for crop damage.Wherever possible, check dams must be constructed in water bodies, and all tanks and ponds must be de-silted. The government must ensure implementation of the Cauvery tribunal award and take steps for increase in water level in Mullaiperiyar Dam to 152 feet, Mr. Venkatachalam said. Their other demands included immediate halt to GAIL pipeline project, subsidy for construction of houses by farmers, pension of Rs. 5,000 per month for agricultural labourers over 60 years of age and takeover of sand and granite quarries by the government to prevent damage to water sources."
