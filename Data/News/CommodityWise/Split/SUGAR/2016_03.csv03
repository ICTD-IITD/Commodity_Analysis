They will work through the Bidar-based College of Horticulture.Resource persons will train farmers in cultivation methods, protection of crops from pests and insects, post-harvest technologies and provide seedlings and other inputs. The farmers will also be exposed to the market for fresh fruits and fruit-based products.The National Research Centre for Banana will organise demonstrations in the fields of progressive farmers and organise lectures on the College of Horticulture premises here.As a first step towards this long-time association, a team, led by the centre director B. Padmanabhan, visited the College of Horticulture recently. They interacted with farmers, teachers and students in the college. They inspected facilities such as the post-harvest laboratory, the library, and the farms and green houses on the college premises.V. Kumar, a scientist, said that Bidars climate was apt for horticulture crops and encouraged farmers to try various types of bananas. It is best to start cultivation in a small area and increase it gradually, he said. He asked farmers to study the market and consult experts before taking up any new crop.R. Thangavelum, another scientist, said that the market for the Kamalapur red banana would grow further as consumers were slowly realising its health benefits.Dr. Padmanabhan pointed out that one of the mandates of the centre was to train farmers in advanced farming methods and to introduce the crop to non-traditional areas. He said that the geology and climate of Bidar and Kalaburagi were well suited for the crop.Temperatures ranging from 25-35 degrees Celsius are optimal for banana. Wind speeds below 40 kmph will protect the crops from falling, he said. This is just the beginning, we will keep coming, he said.Dr. Padmanabhan said that Bhagwant Khuba, MP, initiated this process by writing to the ICAR and the banana research institute. The MP wanted us to inspect the area to see if banana could be grown here and to train farmers, if possible, he said. V. Kumar and K.J. Jayabhaskaran were the other members of the team.Suraj Patil, a farmer from Kamalapur, asked farmers to pick banana over sugarcane. This has a ready-made market, has assured yields and frees you from the clutches of the sugar factories, he said.S.S. Baragimath, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, said that banana farms added up to 2,000 hectares in Bidar district. This can be increased gradually once farmers realise the benefits, he said.He pointed out that farmers could double their cultivable area by opting for drip irrigation, and increase productivity by 20-30 per cent. He said that banana needed 15-20 litres of water per day per plant that was slightly higher than sugarcane. He said that bananas had a large market potential as they could be sold anywhere.College of Horticulture scientists N. Srinivas and Vijalakshmi P. were present."

But in the years since, sugarcane farmers have used political connections and legal challenges  which also buy time  to delay and thwart the MWRRAs plans for equitable water distribution. Sugarcane farmers have also pleaded financial inability to switch to drip irrigation, despite repeated orders by the MWRRA.Order challengedFor example, in October 2015, the MWRRA ordered the release of 10 tmc water from Punes water reservoirs to the Ujani dam in Solapur. This was challenged before the Bombay High Court, which stayed the order. The MWRRA, asked to review its October ruling, passed a second order that only reiterated its earlier order. But by then water levels in the reservoirs showed a 30 per cent depletion. A senior government official told The Hindu , The water was diverted to sugar cane cultivations, to benefit powerful politicians from western Maharashtra including a senior Congress party leader's farmlands. Currently, 70 per cent of Maharashtras water is used for agriculture, and over 60 per cent by cane cultivators.Reservation for industryParinita Dandekar, convenor of the South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People, says that at the lower Terna reservoir, 40 km from Latur, the local sugar factory lifts 5000 lakh litres of water. When I asked dam officials at the site about this, they said industries had reservations, and the factory had a reservation of 0.5 million cubic meters of water."

(Mysugar Mill) here on Tuesday for a first-hand assessment of the ongoing overhauling works of boiler and other machinery.The 82-year-old mill, once one of the biggest sugar factories in Asia, is the lifeline of cane-growers in the district. It had developed major technical and mechanical snags and hence halted the cane crushing activities in 2014-15.Subsequently, the State government had launched the overhauling works in August last year at a cost of Rs. 85 crore.A Pune-based organisation has been repairing the faulty parts of the mill.M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan, Deputy Commissioner, had requested NSI to visit the mill and submit a report regarding the revival of the mill, sources at the Mysugar told The Hindu.The team comprising a chief design engineer, an assistant professor, a junior technical officer and an engineer inspected the machineries. The team had checked the condition and quality of various machineries at the cogeneration unit, boiler and the water purification plant.The overhauling works are in the advanced stage of completion, sources added."

Members of NCC taking part in a mass yoga session to mark International Yoga Day, in Kolkata.If India were to look for a new symbol that would be a representative of what the country stands for today, after Tuesdays great show, it is highly likely that the many-splendoured thing, furled and unfurled with much flourish across the world  the yoga mat  would be a serious contender.On the second International Yoga Day, the skid-free fluorescent mat became a motif of sorts, heralding a new world order of people willing to go out on to the streets, twist themselves into incredible poses, while holding their noses to regulate breath. A world that is willing to celebrate yoga, or the many versions of it anyhow. Suddenly, it is the in-thing to do; the Jane Fonda aerobics video of today, its callisthenics with lurid leotards done in physical training period in school. And with a days careful orchestration, it tends to seem exaggerated, a little fantastic, maybe like a performance, but that is not to take away from the actual benefits of doing yoga, consistently and systematically.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his pitch to the United Nations General Assembly to adopt the day of summer solstice as International Yoga Day, he said: Yoga is an invaluable gift of Indias ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfilment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. He went on to emphasise that the core of the philosophy behind yoga, as outlined in Patanjalis Yogasutra, was not just about exercise, but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate change, he added.Yoga does mean many things for many people: for some it is exercise, its a tool for wellness, its a routine; for others it is a spiritual calling, a way of life, and for very few, it actually is therapy. While modern medicine seems to have reconciled its once stiff-backed opposition to yogas role in health care, there remains the reluctance to harness it as therapeutic intervention, even as a supplement. By and large, in its acceptance yoga remains on the side of wellness, seldom crossing the Rubicon on to the far lands of treatment. The messiahs of modern medicine, with their demanding touchstone of scientific validation for ancient systems of medicine, say there still is insufficient conclusive empirical evidence to show the beneficial effects of using yoga as therapy.E.S. Krishnamoorthy, Chennai-based senior neuropsychiatrist, says there is some research of the benefits of practising yoga in certain categories of patients with certain specific ailments. He has set up integrative therapy clinics (Trimed) across the city that claim to combine modern medicine with ancient wisdom, ensuring that the latter is scientifically validated for use.The autonomic nervous system, which controls key bodily functions, seems most amenable to yoga-based intervention, he explains. Yoga helps with restoring posture and balance, having a soothing effect on anxiety and mood. There is also empirical research that it helps control symptoms of asthma and epilepsy, he says.It has been proved that yoga has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and regulating blood pressure, says V. Mohan, founder, Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre. From a metabolism point of view, yoga is different from other kinds of exercise. When you do cardio, for instance, your heart rate increases, hormone secretion increases, the adrenalin gets going  leaving you in a hyper state. On the other hand, when someone does yoga, we notice what we call cellular silence. It puts the system in a rhythm and all vital parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, pulse rate, and blood sugar are stabilised. However, even here, empirical proof of yogas impact on lowering blood sugar in a diabetic is only just emerging.But the problem, Dr. Krishnamoorthy adds, is also with methodology: when you subject these traditional systems to modern research methods, they end up not holding up. We use methods that are usually employed to validate pharmacological interventions [which forms the bulk of modern medicine] to evaluate non-pharmacological techniques.Now, there are a few people trying to do things differently. For instance, at the Mayo Clinic [in the U.S.], yoga was used as one of a bunch of interventions including tai chi and dance therapy in a programme for patients with dementia, he says. Published research on a pilot study conducted at the clinic indicates that such therapy could improve quality of life, cognitive and physical functions, better than usual care.Another key hurdle might lie, ironically, in what is perceived as a strong point, traditionally  the many styles, variations and practitioners of yoga. Dr. Krishnamoorthy points out that there is no protocol for yoga postures or techniques, and this lacuna renders scientific validation difficult, if not impossible.Meanwhile, yoga has a poster boy in the Indian Prime Minister, who, in televised relays, seems to be capable of great litheness in executing asanas. On Tuesday, he urged all practitioners of yoga to focus on diabetes prevention, again, pushing the agenda into the realm of wellness. It remains to be seen if the Indian government, with the faith it has in the ability of yoga to achieve unity of mind, body, thought and action, will ramp up its promotion of yoga, with adequate scientific proof, to a viable form of supportive therapy.Until then, take comfort in watching a sea of vividly colourful yoga mats take over the world.ramya.kannan@thehindu.co.in"

Hes turned actor. He is playing a small but important part in MS Dhoni: The untold story a biopic on Indian cricket captain M.S. Dhoni and another role in Pelli Choopulu directed by Tarun Bhasckar starring Vijay Devarakonda and Ritu Verma.The salt and pepper look that he sports for the movie rather suits him well. I started greying from the age of 19, and Im tired of colouring my hair. I dont even have a girlfriend to impress so I am happy being myself now. It is so liberating.Will he consider full time acting? Anish says a big No. He calls himself an accidental actor. While working as hero in Dollar Dreams or as Rajas friend in Anand, it was in the last minute someone dropped out and they couldnt find a person immediately, Shekar Kammula would tell him to step in. He observes, Shekar would say, ikkade vunnavuga nuvvu cheseyocchuga.. as long as the role was not very demanding and as long as I had a director who was sensitive to my limitations as an actor and work around, I was happy to do it and a couple of cameo appearances here and there.Anish cites the advantage of a director being an actor, It enables us, as a filmmaker to get into the actors mindset. I know exactly how they are feeling and how unsure and confident they are. Acting is a different experience. Standing in front of the camera, you have to do something real and honest and sometimes over the top.Anish recollects his association with director Tarun Bhasckar. Pelli Choopulu He sent me the script of Pelli Choopulu for feedback and after months of discussing the script he landed up at my house asking me to do a role in the film. I was not very comfortable that time. So I never took up acting seriously but the only time I gave it a consideration was when Sai Kiran Adivi wanted me to do Vinayakudu as I was over weight. But I didn't see myself doing it.He adds, Tarun approached at the right time when I was ready. I lost 50 kgs without going on diet. Exercise became a big part of my life and I reprogrammed my brain from loving white rice, milk, sugar to focusing on highly nutritional daily routine. In this film I did a role older than I am, chopped my hair, went almost bald and played an elite urban character who speaks half English half Telugu. It is a feel-good film where there are no bad guys and it is a beautiful mix of urban and posh Telangana. The film is in post-production stage and I have a lot of confidence in the film; it is about what the generation thinks, their hopes and aspirations. It also has a tremendous ensemble cast, it is a heart-warming, sweet story."

Increasing prevalence of asthma in the Western districts is due to industrialisation, urbanisation, air pollution and smoking, Umashankar of Erode, a doctor specialising in Pulmonary Medicine, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi, said.The dust particles and chemicals emanating from poultry farming, dying unit, cotton mills and sugar factory cause irritation of the lung airways leading to asthma.Long term exposure may lead to irreparable loss in lung function. Children exposed to tobacco smoking have reduced lung function and are predisposed to severe form of asthma, Dr. Umashankar, who is also consultant pulmonologist at Care 24 Hospital, Erode, said.Inspite of asthma being a common problem, myths and belief exist regarding the treatment. Indigenous oral medicines, fish treatment, and acupuncture that are being tried for asthma, have no scientific validation and not advisable, Dr. Umashankar said, explaining that disseminating information about the ailment is the main purpose behind observance of the first Tuesday of May as World Asthma Day.Asthma could be prevented through environmental measures like planting trees to reduce air pollution, using personal protective equipment (mask) in working places, and regular screening of the industrial employee.Inhaled steroids are the safest proven treatment and used across the world to treat asthma since the side effect are almost nil compared to oral medications. The treatment strategy differs for different age groups and has to be tailored by the treating physician, Dr. Umashankar said."

Photo: Mohammed Yousufmore-inWork place stress is a growing concern in the city that masquerades as other problems, state health professionals, even as they warn of severe consequence of uncontrolled stress.The International Labour Organization (ILO) characterises stress depending on content of work and its context.The psychosocial hazards related to working conditions concern the first group while hazards in the organizations work relations are categorized as contextual work stress. In its recent report titled Workplace Stress A Collective Challenge ILO warns that workplace stress is now a global problem.About 1 in 3 people complaining about workplace stress show signs including sleep impairment and a noticeable dip in performance, said Dr. Praveen Kumar, a city-based psychiatrist consulting with Apollo Hospitals.According to Dr. Kumar, the in-house support systems like the popular Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) in reputed multinational organizations which promise anonymous help are not trusted by employees as they fear it can reflect on their assessment. Stressed employees are thus forced to seek external help.In most cases, those presenting signs of stress cannot understand the connection to work.They have higher readings of blood pressure and known diabetes have higher blood sugar levels.There are sleep problems and domestic issues. After some digging, work is identified as the cause, says Dr. Srirang Abkari, an Internal Medicine expert at Global Hospitals.The ILO report featured an expert opinion survey that revealed work overload and time pressure was of greatest concern.Poor work-life balance and poor organizational cultures were other concerns. Most of the experts surveyed also mentioned physical violence, intimidation and harassment as concerns.Improved protection of workers through better legislation, inclusion of stress on the list of occupational diseases and promotion of healthy work practises at work that protect mental health were some of the suggestions made by the experts."

PHOTO: M. MOORTHYThe Jamun fruit has made an out-of-season appearance on vending carts all along the busy N.S.B. Road in the city.While summer is known for mangoes and jackfruits, the purple oblong berry Jamun, the fruit of an evergreen tropical tree native to India and Indonesia, is commonly available in Tamil Nadu in June and July.These Jamuns are from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, where it is harvest time now, said Vembarasan, who has set up his small push cart and basket full of Jamuns in front of a leading departmental store on NSB Road. He sells the fruit at Rs. 30 to Rs. 35 for 250 gm.The Jamuns differ in cost, taste, and texture. Many fruit vendors agree that the Jamuns from Andhra Pradesh are sweeter and have a thicker peel while the fruits harvested in Tamil Nadu are sour in taste and more pulpy. They are costlier by Rs. 10 compared to the locally harvested ones.The difference in harvesting could explain the cost difference, said another vendor. In Tamil Nadu, the ripe fruits are allowed to fall, which makes them mushy. But the Andhra Pradesh Jamuns are hand-plucked, which helps their peel to stay firm for longer, he said.Vembarasan, who starts his day at 8 a.m., said: We first occupy a place for our push cart for the day. Then segregate ripe fruits from the larger basket.He sprays water on his heap of Jamuns to keep it fresh throughout the day.Naval Pazham, as the berry is known in local parlance, is a favourite among the children as it colours the mouth purple and tastes sweet and sour at the same time. Apart from taste, the Jamun has health benefits.The fruit is good for diabetics as it helps lower blood sugar level, said Padma, 40, who sells the fruit near Main Guard Gate. Jamun seeds are powdered to make herbal medicines while the pulp is crushed to make syrups. We sell Jamun syrups as a fruit juice but the pungent taste and strong purple stain are not to everyones liking, she added."

Thirteen of these segments are represented by the ruling AINRC, four by the Congress, five by the AIADMK and one by DMK.The rural segments in Puducherry played a major role in the victory of the AINRC during the 2011 Assembly elections.During the 2011 elections, the AINRC polled 31.75 per cent of the total votes and the Congress 26.53 per cent. The AIADMK and the DMK polled 13.75 per cent and 10.68 per cent votes respectively.Political observers say that the performance of parties in power and also the contributions made by candidates for developing the constituencies during the last five years will be in focus. The most important issue that is sought to be projected by the opposition parties would be the problem of rampant unemployment, price rise and shifting of industries to neighbouring states.The AINRC government has let down all sections of people, particularly Scheduled Castes, rural women and farmers. Large-scale unemployment, diversion of funds meant for SCs and irregularities in the implementation of public distribution system are the major issues that will dominate the campaign, senior Congress leader and former Union Minister for State V. Narayanasamy told The Hindu .The government has also failed to develop rural infrastructure such as roads, electricity and water supply. Most of the cooperative institutions, including cooperative sugar mills have become sick. Voters in Karaikal are seething with anger against the present dispensation and this will reflect in the polls, he said.In the rural segments, the AINRC is facing a strong anti-incumbency factor due to rampant unemployment and distressed farm sector. Farm workers have migrated to urban areas in search of employment.The national rural employment guarantee scheme could have at least helped the rural poor, especially women labourers, get few days of work, said R. Rajangam, secretary of the CPI (M). Against 100 days of work mandated under the scheme, the government implemented the programme only for a few days, he said.Problem of unemployment, shifting ofindustries likelyto be played up"

Secondly, the chances of lifting the cases are slim as the judicial system did not allow it once cases were booked against them.Meanwhile, it was learnt that Mr. Padmanabham would be given fluids forcibly on Tuesday night as his condition is deteriorating. It was indicated by a team of doctors led by Dr. Ramesh Kishore of the RGH and Kakinada Government Hospital senior Professor Dr. CSS Sarma in the evening that it is necessary to take the help of police and revenue officials to give fluids and take blood samples as his condition is deteriorating.It is learntthat theKapu leaderwill be givenfluids forcibly"

But farmers unions keep accusing the government of adopting anti-farmer policies.The Cabinet on Monday approved a proposal of the Agriculture Department to recover Rs. 223 crore from private sugar mills to pay up the dues to sugarcane growers. The Cabinet decided that the government pay the farmers Rs. 112 crore, till the dues were recovered.The farmers, however, said they were being paid their dues after an inordinate delay.A farmer should get the payment for the produce within 10-15 days of sale ... What sugarcane growers are being paid now are the dues for last years crop ... They should also be paid interest for the delay, Satnam Singh Behru, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Manch, told The Hindu . For the past one year, farmers unions have been protesting against the non-payment of dues by the sugar mills."

58f74cafa3d24b0b70c33b90,City leads in obesity and diabetes: study,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/City-leads-in-obesity-and-diabetes-study/article14486372.ece,2016-07-13,"Is it time for the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) to slap a fat tax on the eateries of the city? If the study conducted by eKincare, a company that monitors medical information on the cloud, is any indication Vijayawada has surpassed Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam in obesity. VMC should at least think of a campaign to promote awareness on the dangers of the lifestyle diseases. While Vijayawada is in the first place for diabetes, Visakhapatnam seems to have grabbed the slot for hypertension.The study was based on the analysis of body-mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and random samples collected across three cities  Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad. Going by the BMI, 19 per cent of the respondents from Vijayawada were obese against 11 per cent in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. Going by the blood samples, 7 per cent of the respondents from Vijayawada were diabetic. The percentage of respondents who had diabetes from Hyderabad was only 4 per cent and from Visakhapatnam it was 2 per cent, according to the study.In regard to hypertension (high blood pressure) Visakhapatnam is way ahead of the other two cities with 26 per cent of the respondents suffering from the ailment. Hyderabad is in the second place with 18 per cent of the respondents and Vijayawada third with only 15 per cent of the respondents suffering from hypertension.According to the study, the BMI of respondents of Vijayawada was much higher than that of respondents in Bengaluru and Chennai. The blood pressure and sugar levels of respondents from Bengaluru were comparatively higher than that of people in Chennai, Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam.Sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits are not just limited to the big cities, metros and urban pockets; even non-metros; semi-urban towns are fast imbibing the values of big cities. With increase in spending power, people in non-metro urban towns too have been exposed to junk food and unhealthy environments, said Dr. S. Thrivikram, HoD Diabetes and Metabolism, Oakridge Hospitals.City-based endocrinologist Goutham Meher said that the sample size should be representative of the population of the city. The samples should also take into consideration the different socio-economic strata. Earlier studies have put diabetes in Hyderabad at 14 per cent, he said.Generally speaking BMI, high BP and blood sugar depended on the type of diet. The percentages of obesity, hypertension and diabetes were comparatively high in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu because the staple diets of people in them were richer in carbohydrates. In Kerala, the diet had lesser carbohydrate and in Karnataka it was between Kerala and the two Telugu states and Tamil Nadu, Dr. Goutham explained. He agreed that with the improvement in purchasing power and socio-economic status, more spending on food was leading to obesity and other lifestyle diseases."
58f756bca3d24b0b70c34152,David and the beanstalk,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/David-and-the-beanstalk/article14403930.ece,2016-06-27,"After a whisky chocolate dinner and an interview with David Bello, Earth Loafs founder, Im trying to gather my thoughts, but the bar of chocolate is distracting. Wrapped in candy pink bearing a peacock motif, its anything but candy. Deep dark chocolate of Kerala origin, made with palmyra sugar and locally-sourced ingredients, 72 per cent is wood-fermented in cedar boxes. The chocolate is dark and slightly bitter, has a fruity finish and a woody earthiness that comes from the cedar wood boxes, a first in many ways.For the socially conscious consumer, Earth Loaf ticks all the right boxes. The cocoa is single origin, sourced from either Karnataka or Kerala  therell be one from Tamil Nadu soon  the sweetener used is local palmyra, the farmers are closely involved in the production and its all hand-made. From bean to bar, as Bello is fond of saying, its a local Indian product but it took a Londoner with Greek roots to make it.Originally, the name of Bellos bakery in London, Earth Loaf, came to India when the Londoner moved to Mysore with his partner Angelika in 2012. What started as 3-4 kg of hand-made chocolate for friends and family became a registered company that works with cocoa farmers in Karnataka to create a sustainable Indian chocolate brand. A one-man show today, Earth Loaf is Bellos baby, as he calls it, and he does everything from sourcing cocoa beans to web-designing for the site and even creating the lovely packaging that features a peacock motif from the Chittara art of the Malnad region. Today, Bello calls Mysore home, and having grown up in South Africa, took to Indian climes like a fish to water. I love the heat! I thrive in it, he grins.Artisan, vegan, raw: there are many labels that Earth Loaf identifies with, but thats not what its selling point is. For Bello, its simply his vision, translated through fine chocolate. Which is why the bars are specific in their flavours; they arent trying to cater to a variety of palettes. There have been people who tried our chocolate, disliked it or found it too bitter. But they came back, to try another flavour. A second, third, even a fourth time. They are willing to experiment and they keep coming back, he says. Well aware of the Indian sweet tooth, Bello is just putting out into the market something he enjoys himself: dark chocolate with some unusual pairings. And theres also the story behind each bar.Bello knows the farmers personally; hes even learnt Kannada to converse with them. And he prices his products a bit on the higher side, because he believes that the farmer should get his fair share. The bars are all processed by hand, from the grinding of the beans to the final packing. His 72-per cent bars of single-origin raw chocolate are paired with unusual ingredients like gondhoraj, a lemon thats somewhere between the Italian lemons used to make limoncello and an African kaffir lime found only in parts of Bengal and Assam, smoked salt, dried apricots, nuts and more. Bellos background as a mixologist is reflected in how he pairs flavours, often reworking an idea for months at a time, until he gets it right. Even when I was bartending back in London, Id work on a single cocktail, like a Martinez, for about six months till I got it right, he says. And its the same with his fruit pairings. Recently, hes been trying to infuse a jamun-like fruit native to Karnataka into his chocolate, without much success. The chocolate keeps overpowering it, so Im trying different things. Ive been trying to squeeze the essence out of the rind of the fruit, like how you would a bergamot, but it didnt work. So now Im trying to dry the rind, powder it and see if that will work better.For a country thats quite a prolific producer of cocoa, India seems to be a relative newcomer when it comes to the bean-to-bar chocolate.Cocoa was originally brought to India from Indonesia in 1798, by the East India Company, Bello says, and India has had varieties of cocoa growing, but it wasnt until the 1950s that Cadbury decided to push cocoa farming in India.Much like the coffee culture that came from the West to show us the amazing varieties we have in India, theres a wave of chocolate appreciation thats slowly gaining ground.A far cry from the candy bars you see at grocery stores, todays artisanal chocolate is locally sourced and handmade. Its tasting notes range from woody and fruity to acidic, and is affected by the terroir, and lends itself to all kinds of pairings from food to wine and whisky.And this chocolate evangelist from Mysore is more than happy to introduce us to our own hidden chocolate treasures."
58f75f3da3d24b0b70c3449c,Prohibition: mills look for nod to scale up ethanol production,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/prohibition-mills-look-for-nod-to-scale-up-ethanol-production/article8634583.ece,2016-05-23,"Farmers fear that implementation of total prohibition, even if in phases as proposed by the new Government, might not augur well for economic viability of sugar mills in the State.Cane farmersMills with distilleries fear that they would incur heavy revenue losses since Indian Made Foreign Liquor manufacturers procure rectified spirit from them. Cane farmers wonder why the Government has not specified how the revenue loss would be recompensed, Subi Thalapathi, representative of Thadapalli-Arakankottai Ayacut Farmers Association, said.The AIADMK has promised phased implementation of prohibition by reducing working hours of Tasmac liquor outlets, reducing number of shops, closing down bars and opening of rehabilitation centres.Future lossesFarmers say the State Government will have to raise the cap on ethanol production for sugar mills to make good future losses due to the prohibition policy. They have a reason to emphasise on this point since the Central Government has promised to pass on subsidy benefit of Rs. 4.50 per quintal of sugar in the event of the mills meeting 80 per cent target set for ethanol production.Last year, oil marketing companies had announced intention to procure 2.66 billion litres of ethanol for their 10 per cent mandatory blending with petrol. The procurement price varies between Rs. 48.50 and Rs. 49.50. The realisation for the mills is Rs. 41 to Rs. 42 per litre, about Rs. 5 more than what was prevailing earlier.But, scaling up of ethanol production was not possible in Tamil Nadu since the State had imposed a cap of 50 lakh litres, so as to make sure that rectified spirit, a pre-form of ethanol with 95 per cent purity, is made available for IMFL manufacturers. The mills are helpless though they have a cumulative capacity to produce 6.25 lakh litres of ethanol a day.Cheaper costsBut, again, the imposition of 14.5 per cent VAT on alcohol has resulted in stagnation of the produce. Every month, the mills have an average monthly alcohol inventory of 2.75 crore litres. But, a large quantity stagnates since IMFL manufacturers are able to import alcohol from sugar mills in Karnataka at cheaper costs.The mills, according to an official here, are keenly looking for a green signal from the newly-elected government for scaling up ethanol production and meeting the target set by the Centre, in the interests of farmers."

The mills have not adhered to the Centres pricing mechanism as well, points out the secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S. Vimalnathan in the petition.The State Government could consider taking over the administration of the errant sugar mills in the lines of the action taken against Annamalai University following complaints of maladministration, Mr. Vimalnathan demanded.The State Government could alternatively credit the amount due to growers instead of the mills doing that after inordinate delay and also take steps to ensure that the mills paid the dues to the farmers with interest, he had said in the petition.With the State Government declaring that Tamil Nadu has become power surplus, there was no justification in further delaying energisation of farm power pump sets for which applications under general and self financing streams have been pending since 2000 and the State Budget could be a good opportunity to help the farmers, the petition noted.Also the farmers are hoping that the State Government would allot sufficient funds to desilt and dredge the thousands of lakes, tanks and ponds, the vital sources of water for irrigation.Desilt waterbodiesThe State Government that was lauded by the World Bank among other organisations for the path-breaking rainwater harvesting movement launched in 2001 could take the lead in clearing all the waterbodies of all types of encroachments and desilting them for the benefit of the farmers in need of water, the petition further noted."

Picture used for representational purposesA decline in soil fertility, climate change and shortage of labour are some of the reasons that have led to the decline in sugarcane production in the State over the last few years.According to the Sugarcane Research Station in Cuddalore functioning under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), the production was 30,100 (in thousand tonne) in 2012-13 and 25,700 during 2013-14.Though there was an increase in the production between 2009 and 2012, the rate of produce could not be maintained due to various factors. The production was 29,746 (in thousand tonne) during 2009-10, 34,252 during 2010-11 and 35,309 during 2011-12.There are various factors for the decline in the sugarcane production. Decline in soil fertility, climate change and the need for high cane yield and sugar recovery varieties and non availability of pure seed are some of the reasons behind the decline in production, said R.S. Purushothaman, professor and Head of the Sugarcane Research Station.Labour shortage, escalation in the cost of cultivation and non-adoption of Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative, drip fertigation systems by farmers are also said to be the reasons. As for the diseases, red rot poses a major challenge for the farmers. Cane productivity in the State is dependent on excessive rainfall and drought which appear at regular intervals leading to wide fluctuations in output , he added. The Sugarcane Research Station, Cuddalore, has brought out 24 varieties so far to increase the production and sugar recovery."

Then, the clerk, and of course the people in the queue, will quickly determine that you are a genuine platform ticket aspirant and not a sly queue jumper.Only after the man behind the counter and the people in front it come to a consensus will you be allowed to sidle up to the booking window bypassing the queue.The same frustrating fate awaits those wanting to make a simple enquiry as they too have to stand in a common queue because there is no separate information counter.While there has been an increase in train services and passenger traffic through this station over the years, one wonders why Puducherry railway station lags behind when it comes to setting up simple facilities such as a separate counter for platform tickets or an information/enquiry window.Government itself needs helpChief Minister N. Rangasamy minced no words to bring to the notice of employees of the Puducherry Cooperative Sugar Mills at Lingareddypalayam the poor financial position of his government and the pathetic condition the sugar mill had been facing for the last few years. A large number of employees met Mr. Rangasamy in his chamber seeking expeditious settlement of arrears. The Chief Minister said that it would not be possible for the government to meet the demands as his government had been facing a severe financial crunch.Mincing no words, Mr. Rangasamy said that the government itself was in need of Rs.370 crore to meet its commitment over the next three months. The Central Government is not coming to the rescue and what is the solution he asked?A Tanglish tangleThe two-day international conference organised by the International Movement for Tamil Culture (India and Canada chapter) began with a Tanglish welcome note.The Indian president of the Movement Malathy Rajavelu spoke on how to transcend the language per se and imbibe the Tamil cultural heritage.Having grown up in Bangalore, her difficulty in speaking pure Tamil should not be seen as a challenge to head the movement. We need to preserve the cultural heritage of the classical language and that is more important than speaking, she said in Tanglish as she welcomed the gathering.On the contrary, many speakers including Chief Minister N. Rangasamy who inaugurated the programme stressed on the need to encourage children to speak in mother tongue even if the parents had settled abroad. The parents should encourage their children to talk in Tamil at home. This is the way to preserve the cultural legacy of Tamil language, he said.Protected by saintsRecently, while participating in the launch of the 22nd International Yoga Festival, Minister for Welfare and Tourism P. Rajavelu appeared to have been overwhelmed while holding forth on the rich heritage of Puducherry. He paid glowing tributes to the great sages who had made Puducherry their home. He even went to the extent of declaring that this port town did not suffer from natural disasters, including the recent floods, due to the divine presence of these Siddhars.By M. Dinesh Varma,S.

Getting hooked to it is a recipe for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), because the fructose load proves too much for the organ.Sugar contains both fructose and glucose. Excess fructose gets converted into fat and deposits in the liver. More fructose over the years inflicts more harm  possible cirrhosis. Children aged 8-10 are already showing early symptoms of NAFLD such as liver enlargement, says Head of Paediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital M. Vijayakumar. We see a rise in such cases over the last five years, and these can worsen to NAFLD if not taken off the beverage, says Dr. Vijayakumar.Paediatric gastroenterologist at Swedish Medical Centre in Seattle, U.S., Uma Pisharody got the fruit juice struck off the menu for patients in her hospital, which became the first to do so in the U.S. As a paediatric gastroenterologist, the dangers of excessive fructose intake are something I witness on a daily basis, treating kids with NAFLD, the most common cause of chronic liver disease in children, she told The Hindu over e-mail.The take-home message for my patients with NAFLD is that the fat in their liver has come from the excessive amount of added sugar (specifically fructose) in their diet. Dr. Vijayakumar explains that excess carbohydrate in fructose gets converted into fat and deposits in the liver.Unlike the alcohol-induced FLD, the non-alcoholic version takes some years to worsen. With unchecked, high consumption of sweetened juice, these young NAFLD cases could develop cirrhosis around the age of 40.Artificial colouring agents in juice is hepatotoxic (toxic to the liver). In countries where quality control mechanism is lax, excess use of these agents for commercial gains could have a huge public health impact, he points out.Dr. Uma Pisharody strongly advocates consumption of the whole fruit to benefit from the fibre content. When fructose binds to fibre, the digestion process is different. A major portion of fructose is processed and excreted instead of going directly to the liver, she says.Reporting byK.V. Prasad"

They will have to stop relying on ready-to-cook meals, like instant noodles and other unhealthy fast food. This follows an advisory by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) earlier in January asking schools to promote healthy snacks and eschew chocolates, cakes, biscuits, chips and other such items that are fast becoming tiffin box staples.While working parents acknowledge that the move is a much-needed step in the right direction, many say that they will have to start planning healthy meals in advance. To help them, city-based schools have decided to appoint teachers to monitor what is in a childs tiffin box during lunch breaks and also ensure that they do not consume junk food in school.The circular pointed out that consumption of food, which is high in fat, salt and sugar has been found to be associated with many diseases, including type-II diabetes, hyper-tension and childhood obesity. It is based on a report submitted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development that highlighted the problem of excess junk foods available in and around schools.Over the past decade, CBSE has been trying to urge member schools to ensure that junk food is not seen on campus. While some managements have initiated steps to implement the advisory, many are waking up after the recent circular. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management of Delhi Public School group, said that they would ensure that school canteen management committees comprising teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators would be formed by next week. He said that the management had a meeting last week and said that they would issue circulars and create awareness to ensure that parents are sensitised to the issue.Sridevi S.A., Principal, BBUL Jain Vidyalaya said that lunch breaks are already supervised by teachers and they apprise parents if a child is found to be eating junk food."

Though there is water in some of the rivers and reservoirs, shortage of power supply has affected pumping of water, said Mr. Khandagave.Ironically, many sugar mills will fall short of sugarcane in the next two to three years as they had enhanced crushing capacities without making efforts to expand sugarcane area in their operational areas.They had not assessed the ground realities before increasing crushing capacities. Also, a few more sugar mills are coming up in Belagavi district and other parts of the State, and the shortage of raw material could lead to unhealthy competition in the days to come, added Mr. Khandagave."

They accused the ruling Samajwadi Party government of cheating cane farmers in the State, the countrys second-largest sugar producer.The party, which claims to be farmer friendly, has cheated them by not hiking the cane price, said BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak, adding that the ruling Samajwadi Party government should have fixed the price at least Rs 350 per quintal.SP in its election manifesto had said that price of agriculture produce would be fixed according to the cost of production, Mr Pathak recalled.He further said that an increase in the SAP would have definitely motivated tillers to continue with cane farming.Meanwhile, the U.P.

The shares are typically pledged with non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) or even banks, which lend up to a certain percentage of the value of shares that are offered to be pledged.According to Pranav Haldea, managing director, Prime Database, the findings point to a high level of financial distress among the listed companies, especially as the equity markets are showing a downward trend. The study analysed all companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).As per the study, there were pledged shares in as many as 517 of the 1,506 NSE-listed companies as on December 31, 2015. Six years back, the number of such companies was only 370. Also, during this six-year period, the percentage of total promoter holding pledged has gone up from about 27 per cent to 46 per cent.Incidentally, there are 208 companies in which more than 50 per cent of the promoters shareholding has been pledged. According to Mr Haldea, high pledge levels are typically not considered a good sign by the investors as a downturn in the market price can lead to invocation and change in management.There were as many as 25 companies in which the complete 100 per cent holding of the promoters was pledged as on December 31, 2015. The list includes companies such as AGC Networks, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar, DQ Entertainment (International), Era Infra Engineering, Gokaldas Exports, IL&FS Investment Managers, IVRCL, Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering and Subex, among others.Interestingly, there are also instances of companies wherein the promoters pledged a high quantum of their shares for the first time in the period between September and December 2015.Listed entities such as Zenith Birla India, Sharon Bio-Medicine, Shriram EPC, Melstar Information Technologies, and Uttam Sugar Mills were among the 82 companies wherein the percentage of promoter holding pledged increased during the period.On the other hand, companies such as Mangalam Cement, Ashapura Minechem, Tree House Education & Accessories, NCL Industries, Mangalam Timber Products, Prakash Industries, Century Enka, Ganesh Housing Corp, Gujarat NRE Coke and Sical Logistics saw a decrease in the quantum of share pledging by promoters.The largest pledge creation transaction in the quarter was that of S.B.Adani Family Trust, promoter of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, which pledged 7.60 crore shares to IDBI Trusteeship Services.In terms of the pledge, the entity with whom the shares are pledged, the maximum amount of shares were pledged to the Kotak Group followed by Indusind Bank."

Whether it is possible to provide the requested remedy or not should be clearly explained so that the petitioner need not come back for the same issue, he said.The Collector also instructed senior officials from all departments to be present during grievance day meetings. He told the farmers that a booklet detailing schemes available from various departments for farmers would be issued during the farmers grievance meeting next month.On the issue raised by several farmers that many regions, particularly those close to tail-end areas of Periyar-Vaigai canal, had not received water as the encroachments on tanks and canals were not removed, Mr. Rao instructed the PWD and revenue officials to first conduct a survey of all the tanks and canals.He told the farmers that priority would be given for de-silting and proper maintenance of canals and tanks.He said that a government order had already been issued to enable farmers to use MGNREGS workers to work in their farms.He assured the farmers that steps would be taken to implement the order in the district. Mr. Rao added that removal of seemai karuvelam trees would also be taken up under the MGNREGS.Long-pending issuesThe farmers also highlighted some of the long-pending issues including non-completion of the 58-canal project, provision of irrigation to dry areas in Usilampatti regions, and non-settlement of balances to sugarcane farmers by National Cooperative Sugar Mills.A booklet detailing schemes available for farmers to be issued during farmers grievance meeting next month"

I will take a decision soon, he said. Some of his followers said he would try to contest from the ruling Congress, while others said he would not look beyond the BJP.It is said that the Nagamarapalli family wants to remain in the good books of the State government as it wants financial and other kinds of support for the district central cooperative bank and the cooperative sugar factory they run, said a leader close to the family.The Janata Dal (Secular), meanwhile, has a long list of aspirants.The former Minister and JD(S) State unit vice-president Bandeppa Kashempur said his contest would be decided by the party.The former MLA Rahim Khan of the Congress appears confident of his selection. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and other Congress leaders have promised me that I will get ticket, he said. He lost to Gurupadappa Nagamarapalli by 2,571 votes in the 2013 elections.The big four families that control the strings of power in different parties in the district are all related. The Nagamarapalli family is related to MLA Rajshekar Patil of Humnabad family, which is in turn related to MLA Eshwar Khandre family of Bhalki whose three other members have been MLAs in the past.

The absence of the winter flower show, which proved a big hit in the past, also dampened the spirit of both the tourists and local traders alike.The boat house at the entrance of the hill station is the major attraction for the tourists.All the motor fitted boats and those with pedals have been in good demand.

The mill owners had not paid it despite agitations by growers and promises by the government. It had prompted farmers to commit suicide, Mr. Shanthkumar alleged. He criticised Minister for Cooperation H.S. Mahadev Prasad for delaying the fixing of sugarcane price, even though the Centre had announced the Fair and Remunerative Price.The Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh governments have announced Rs. 2,800 a tonne for sugarcane. Karnataka is not taking a decision only to protect the interests of sugar mills controlled by politicians belonging to the Congress and the BJP, Mr. Shanthkumar said.He said that if the government did not have funds, it should seize 20,000 tonnes of gold lying idle in temples across the country, which would fetch Rs. 50 billion crore. That could be invested for boosting agriculture and farmers income, Mr. Shanthkumar said.Earlier, he handed over a cheque for Rs. 2.53 lakh through Deputy Commissioner N.

Mungle, who operates the ghana, is pleased to give his visitors a sweet treat that includes fresh sugarcane juice and fresh gur-cream.Balu Mungle is a traditional jaggery-maker. This year, he has grown sugarcane in nearly four acres of land that will get transformed into gur. He finds gur-making a better option instead of supplying his sugarcane to sugar factories and wait for payment for several months and years and be at their mercy.Also, the un-remunerative prices for sugarcane offered by sugar mills have been a discouraging factor not only for Balu Mungle but also for several other farmers. However, not many set up a ghana, as it requires Rs. 1 lakh for a new unit.The gur-making process commences with the cutting of sugarcane, followed by extraction of sugarcane juice, boiling the extracted juice in a large iron pan, its purification, again boiling, then concentration of such boiled juice and finally, forming lumps in moulds, usually bucket that come in different sizes.Normally, about a quintal of gur is produced from one tonne of sugarcane. The cost involved is mainly on labour, diesel and electricity for the crusher, ingredients used as preservatives and to enhance colour and texture, and transportation to the market. The dry husk of the sugarcane (what remains of sugarcane after the juice is extracted) is used as fuel for heating/boiling the juice.But, the main problem gur-makers face is exploitation by middlemen in the markets who, it is said, bring down procurement prices. It is also said that middlemen hoard and release gur when the prices go up.So, I have decided to store gur myself and wait till the prices go up, at least up to Rs. 3,000 per quintal, as the prevailing prices range from Rs. 2,200 to Rs. 2,500 per quintal, Balu Mungle said.Farmer BaluMungle operatesa ghana and markets gur onhis own"

The scheme must ensure that a plot is considered a unit to compensate the farmers for their loss, he said.Mr. Badal said that insuring the crop only if the entire village pays its premium was also an impractical assumption and therefore, the Centre should look into these shortcoming seriously and amend them.We are bringing all these points to the notice of the Central government and will urge it to amend the scheme so that farmers, especially from the original green revolution states like Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, benefit from it, he added.The new crop insurance scheme that was launched earlier this month has been perceived as Prime Minister Narendra Modis first significant move to address rural hardship and woo voters ahead of key elections after the government faced criticism for ignoring the concerns of the farmers.Refuting the allegation levelled by Congress that main accused in the Abohar murder case was associated with Shiromani Akali Dal, Mr. Badal said that this was baseless as the person concerned was not related to his party directly or indirectly.The Chief Minister said the State government was fully committed to nab those behind the killing.On probe being carried out by National Investigation Agency (NIA) into Pathankot terror attack, the Chief Minister said that the national agency was probing the incident very minutely and any one found guilty in this case would not be spared at any cost.He said the state government was adopting a zero tolerance towards the issues involving national security, law and order, peace and brotherhood.Anyone found indulging in such issues of grave national importance will not be spared at any cost, said Mr. Badal.The Chief Minister said Punjab was the only state in the country where the entire government goes to the doorsteps of the people to solve their problems through Sangat Darshans.Mr. Badal also refuted the allegations regarding discrimination in allocation of funds adding that opposition was criticizing this programme just for the sake of criticism.Earlier addressing the public gatherings in village Urapar and Wazidpur, the Chief Minister said he would continue to hold Sangat Darshans across the State.This is a growth oriented programme and nothing can deter me from carrying on this exercise, the Chief Minister said.Listing the major initiatives taken by his government, the Chief Minister said it has decided to double the pensions given to people under the social security schemes besides hiking the honorarium of NambardarsMr. Badal said in an initiative to provide better health care services to economically weaker sections of the society, the state government has decided to enhance the existing limit of free treatment in government and private hospitals to nearly 28.50 lakh blue card holders from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000 annually under Bhagat Puran Singh Sehat Beema YojnaHe also said Rs. 540 crore arrears has been already paid to sugarcane growers by government, besides arranging Rs. 200 crore loan to private sugar mills for sugarcane arrears.Mr. Badal said State government has also decided to give Rs. 295 per quintal for sugar cane against Rs. 220 fixed by the Centre.State government was providing free power to farmers of the state at a cost of Rs. 5000 crore every year, the Chief Minister. - PTIDeclaring a village as a unit for crop insurance would hardly fulfil the basic spirit of the scheme"

Manufactured food inflation surged to 8 per cent from 4.5 per cent over the same period. Inflation in prices of cereals and pulses are persistently high for the past seven months and is firming up, Ranen Banerjee, Leader Public Finance and Economics, PwC India said. Manufactured food price has also registered a sharp rise that may not be a good sign.Inflation in manufactured products moved into positive territory after 13 months, rising to 0.7 per cent in April from a contraction of 0.13 per cent in the previous month.The situation in the fuel and power segment eased somewhat in April with inflation in the sector contracting 4.8 per cent compared to a contraction of 8.3 per cent in March.Commodity prices spikePrices of manufactured products rose on the back of increases in global commodity prices and a rise in sugar price on the back of expected shortages in the market, Ms. Gupta said. The number still remains low and given the outlook on commodity prices, (we) expect WPI to remain low.There are, however, other factors that could drive inflation up in the future such as monsoon and fuel prices.If the outlook on the monsoons turns negative, the prices of food products may go up further with traders trying to hedge their positions now to gain in the future, Mr. Banerjee said.The fuel and power prices are still in the negative territory. However, the base effect on these is expected to wither out soon and we could see inflationary trends by July 2016, he said.With retail inflation at 5.4% in April, RBI may not cut rates further"

However, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told The Hindu on Wednesday that there was no reason for concern.Whatever location we finalise will be in consultation with experts, he said, adding that safety protocols will be followed. It is too early to jump to conclusions, he said.Acquiring plateausEnvironmentalists, though, fear the worst and point to his recent announcements. On Monday, the CM had held a meeting with Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, announcing Indias biggest green refinery  a joint venture with the Bharat Petroleum, the Indian Oil and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited on the Vijaydurg plateau in north Sindhudurg district by acquiring over 15,000 hectares of land.To the north of this proposed project lies the Madban plateau, which is being acquired to set up the 9,900 MW Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project (JNPP).Recently, French firm EDF acquired Areva (another French company), the nuclear firm that was originally slated to provide technology for this project.The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) has reportedly signed an MoU with EDF to build nuclear reactors here. While work on the project has been stopped for the last few years due to pendency of certain techno-commercial agreements, there are no roadblocks to this project.Debate lost for translationIn addition to these projects, the Ambolgad beach in Ratnagiri has been earmarked for the construction of a multi-purpose port. According to the projects Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report, it is proposed to have both forward and backward integration by developing jetty-based industries such as a bauxite benefication plant, a steel plant and gas or coal-based thermal power plant, sugar refineries, a container hub and tank farms directly or through joint ventures and acquisitions.Last week, a prescheduled environmental public hearing for the project was cancelled and postponed as the EIA report was available only in English; villages that will be potentially affected have demanded a draft in Marathi.Drawing local ireAnalysing individual projects for their adverse impact on the environment wont do any good. An integrated approach is needed for projects coming up in ecologically-sensitive area like Konkan, said renowned ecologist Madhav Gadgil, who had headed the Centre-appointed committee that studied the impact of projects, including dams, on the Western Ghats."

They were provided orientation on a new drying method based on osmosis - dipping the whole or sliced fruit in sugar solution and putting it through hot-air drying. They were trained in packaging the chips to retain the flavour for months.The farmers could expand their horizon of thinking beyond producing just tender coconuts, coconuts and copra.They not only learnt about devoting more attention to the crops and pest management practices, but also value addition through exposure to various products, Assistant Director of Agriculture Modakurichi Kulandaivelu, who escorted the team, said.There were also members in the team who were already into manufacturing virgin coconut oil who gained insights into making their ventures more profitable.Their learning also included coconut-based integrated farming system.The Interstate training - Integrated Crop Management in Coconut, was sponsored by the State Government under the aegis of 'Submission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE), Support to State Extension Program for Extension Reforms (SSEPERS) and Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA), he said."

The Government will incur an additional expenditure of Rs.5.40 crores, Mr. Rangasamy said.Crushing seasonThe crushing season for 2014-15 will commence on March 4. A decision to this effect was also taken at the tri-partite meeting.Sugarcane farmers have been asking the government to fix SAP for the past six months. For 2013-14, the Government had fixed the SAP at Rs. 2,700 per tonne. The SAP fixed by the Government for 2014-15 is Rs.100 less than the rate fixed by neighbouring Tamil Nadu.So far, SAP offered by the Puducherry government has generally been above SAP of neighbouring States, except during 2012-13 when farmers were paid in the name of advance for their supply to Cooperative Sugar MillMeanwhile, sugarcane farmers have expressed disappointment over the SAP announced by the Government for 2014-15.We were expecting to get at least Rs.3,000 a tonne.

It also made a tongue in the cheek comment on how any opinion conveyed through art was liable to misinterpretation these days. The voice also claimed that their artistic attempt was not to hurt anyone but to gently chide the common man for straying away from the path of devotion. Story and scriptwriter G. Radhakrishnan has managed to do that under the able direction of Sureshwar.Although the message was serious, the comic aspects dominated most parts of the script. The title song by Deva, a rehash of the hit movie song, Thirupathi Ezhumala Venkatesa, the casual inclusion of English words and words related to technology in the chaste Tamil dialogues rendered by MahaVishnu, the innumerable jokes cracked by Gajalakshmi and Narada set the expectations high.Humans are put to test by Gods in a world where money reigns supreme, and all other values are almost forgotten.The second scene in which all the characters are introduced has many funny parts, although it tends to be a bit long. The scene in which a dying woman recognises divinity is well portrayed, and the story picks up pace from there.Madhuvanthi as Andal, the devotee, and Sureshwar as her irresponsible and irreverent husband performed convincingly, while the actor playing Narayana was a perfect fit. Two other characters who would be hard to forget are the male actor playing the role of the heros mother, and the fraudulent siddhar, who dances across the stage. All these characters mouth Tamil words in the slang of slum dwellers in Chennai.While devotees may benefit from prayer, prayer itself should not end up as being a mere bargain. This message conveyed by the play went well with the audience as it was sugar coated with fun and frolic by Magam enterprises.Rajalakshmi Padmanabhan"

Agitated growers have been forced to throw out the coconuts on the streets to give vent to their pent up anger, he said.Mr. Natarajan alleged that procurement of copra was not in line with rules and regulations as there the procurement of copra itself has fallen. The Union and the State governments must intervene in the issue and provide succour to the growers, he added.Backing him, another farmer V. Veerasenan of Ponnavarayankottai pointed out that Thanjavur district occupied the second spot in the State in coconut production and more than 40,000 hectares of land had been brought under coconut groves.The State government had stopped copra procurement since 2012 and the Centres support price and incentive were not adequate to cover the cultivation cost. Unfortunately, the State government did not announce the support price and incentive at all compounding the woes of growers.These factors had forced the growers to sell their produce to the private buyers and traders who were fixing atrocious rates. The Central and the State governments must immediately intervene to save the growers, he demanded.Coconut growers alleged that the unbridled import of coconut oil has adversely impacted on the coconut oil production in the domestic market consequent to which the copra procurement has not happened to the desired extent. They wanted import of coconut oil restricted to ease the situation.Kakkarai Sukumaran wanted the banks and lending institutions to stop auctioning off jewel pledged by farmers with the institutions.

We have now finalised purchasing fodder to meet the demand till June 10. We have requested the district administration to provide 1,000 tonnes of fodder at the price given to farmers to partially meet the demand, he said.Mr. Diggavi said that the trust had also finalised purchasing more than 2,000 tonnes of withering sugarcane in around 260 acres of land in Afzalpur, Aland and other parts of the district to be served as fodder to cattle housed in the cattle shed.

Together, the two governments have gifted Atma Hatya Bhagya to growers instead of taking concrete steps to save them and provide them relief from exploitation by traders and sugar mills.The governments had also failed to find a solution to the Mahadayi water dispute and were instead indulging in a blame game only to suit their politics at the expense of farmers.Both the Congress and the BJP were organising public meetings with an eye on votes and to strengthen their vote-base. The Centre was doling out incentives to the industry and corporate sector but was not willing to address the plight of farmers in distress except serving lip-sympathy, he said."

His party colleague and Leader of Opposition Swami Prasad Maurya alleged the government was only befooling farmers and it had not raised the sugarcane prices for successive years.Our government led by Ms. Mayawati had made substantial increase, Mr. Maurya added.Responding to Mr. Mauryas charge, Mr. Khan said though sugarcane prices had been raised by the Mayawati government, sugar mills were sold away at throwaway prices during the BSP rule as a result of which there was no let up in the problems of the farmers.Mr. Maurya retorted saying only the mills that had been lying closed for 15 to 20 years were sold and the money earned was deposited in the treasury.Mr. Khan said only a meagre amount was deposited and the real sum went elsewhere and accused the BSP government of being solely responsible for the plight of farmers. He said BSP was punished for it by the people.Mr. Khan asked the BSP leader to go through the records to satisfy himself that maximum payments to the sugarcane growers were made by the present government.Mr. Maurya said while the Samajwadi Party government is siding with mill owners, the Mayawati dispensation had forced them (owners) to make payment and also sent some of them to jail. - PTI"

The CITU-affiliated Workers and Employees Union of the factory also submitted a memorandum to the Collector.Salaries not paidDistrict secretary of AP Koulu Rytu Sangham A.

They are continuing with the factory with the hope that the factory would start functioning.There was no reason for not starting the crushing, Mr. Balakrishna said. One lakh tonne of sugarcane is ready for crushing in the area under the factory.The farmers are ready to supply cane to Tummapala factory as the jaggery is not tempting this time since its price has fallen.

Photo: by Special ArrangementYogendra Yadav, well-known psephologist and central coordination committee member of Swaraj Abhiyan, has questioned the State governments move to allot land for expansion of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).He told presspersons here on Saturday that it was obnoxious to hear that the government was setting aside farm land for the expansion of MRPL. The government had issued a notification cancelling the allotment of land for the second phase of the Mangalore Special Economic Zone following agitations. The government was now trying to allot nearly 2,000 acres of land to MRPL.Questioning the need for allotting such a large extent of land, Mr. Yadav said that the government was building land banks and favour corporate houses. The Swaraj Abhiyans Jai Kisan Andolan would join organisations in their fight against allocation of land to MRPL.Mr. Yadav said he and other activists of the Jai Kisan Andolan had extensively toured areas in Karnataka and 11 other drought-affected States since October 2015. In December 2015, the andolan activists filed a petition in the Supreme Court for better implementation of schemes under the Mahahtma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the guidelines mentioned in the drought management manual.We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will uphold our petition in February first week, he said.Mr. Yadav said that non-payment of dues to farmers by sugarcane mills was a problem across the country. Sugar mill owners, most of who were politicians, owe nearly Rs. 37,000 crore to farmers. But it was strange that the Union government was giving them a loan of Rs. 6,000 crore, he added."

Bopanna has brought alive this unique trait in his book The Romance of Indian Coffee , now shortlisted for the Gourmand International Award, where it will vie for the top honours among coffee books from Brazil, France, China, Thailand, and the U.S., to name a few.Hailing from Kodagu, which is the home of coffee in India, it was natural for Mr. Bopanna to feel inspired to write on the brew which has a universal appeal.My earlier works were Kodagu-centric, but I found a wider canvas in coffee which is also related to Kodagu, said Mr. Bopanna.The book traces the history of coffee in India with interesting titbits about the brew and how its cultivation in the shade lends it a unique flavour, unlike coffee grown in the open in most other countries, explained Mr. Bopanna, who believes that making coffee is an art. Notwithstanding the proliferation of coffee bars, the best filter coffee, he said, was still prepared in the bylanes of Chennai and elsewhere in Tamil Nadu.The contribution of Ivor Bull, a British planter, who introduced intercropping and is a legend among the locals, has been highlighted in the book as also recipes for making coffee liqueur.But ironically, he notes that Kodavas, who market home-grown coffee to the rest of the world and have spanned a coffee culture in India, have taken after the British and prefer tea!There are entries from as many as 64 countries for the Gourmand awards, started in 1995 as a celebration of global cookbook and wine book publishing.

Yadav described it was a pack of truth aimed at balanced development of rural and urban areas.Stressing that there could be no comparison between the coming up of the Agra-Lucknow Expressway with the Noida Expressway of the then BSP government, mr. Yadav said unlike the previous government, no package or sweeteners were given to any business house nor were farmers forced to give their land for the same.No farmer was killed nor anyone sent to jail by our government for taking land for the expressway, he said.(Rejecting opposition charge that Purvanchal and Bundelkhand areas were neglected in the budget, Mr. Yadav said his government was taking good care of all regions.For Bundelkhand, he said while ponds and rivers like Chandrawal which had become almost extinct were being revived, Hamirpur will be converted into an organic district where use of organic fertiliser will be promoted in a big way.Besides, for these areas which have witnessed drought, mr. Yadav said free foodgrains will be provided to people under the Right to Food Security Act.The government has decided to provide free foodgrains to the people of Bundelkhand region, he said, adding, We have also decided to provide flour, oil, ghee, potato, salts and several other things to poor people of the state.To address the shortage of drinking water, the government would press into service 1,500 water tankers in Bundelkhand so that villagers were provided with quality drinking water, he said.The Chief Minister said his government would develop a greenfield city.He said adequate power and good roads were the main priorities of his government.Brushing aside criticism that sugarcane prices have not been hiked for consecutive years by his government, he said that on coming to power his government had hiked it by Rs 40 in one go in 2012.Besides, we have forced the sugar mills to pay over Rs 77,000 crore to the cane farmers during the four-year rule even though the prices of sugar was at the lowest, he said.On law and order front, the Chief Minister said some small issues also become hot news while the good work remains in the background.He accused the media of tarnishing the image of his government over the law and order issue.

Farmers, who have been battling acute scarcity of water, withering crops and parched lands, have been waiting regime after regime for measures to breathe life into their waning livelihood.With rains failing them, farmers have been facing drought situation for close to a decade. Many of them have been demanding the government to declare Vellore as drought-prone district and take up remedial measures to create a lifeline for agriculture. But their demands have not yielded any result.Sixty-three-year-old S. Narayanamurthy of Pennathur village is one of them. His parched land is proof of the agrarian crisis staring at farmers.I could not raise any crops for the last five years due to non-availability of water. , he said.Seek restoration of PalarThe well in his farm has remained dry for several years. Water level rose only after the rains during November 2015. Now, there is 75 per cent water in the well, and I hope to raise paddy this year, he added.Many farmers like him are looking forward for measures to restore the Palar river that has been bearing the brunt of rampant sand mining.K. Loganathan, district president of Thamizhaga Vivasaigal Sangam, said 15 years of poor rainfall has turned Palar into a perennially dry river. Promises of declaring the district as drought-prone and grant of relief continue to remain as mere promises, he noted.Dam work abandonedDuring the previous DMK regime, the foundation stone was laid to construct a dam at Bathrapalli in Pernambut. But this work was abandoned after the government changed, he said.One of the biggest disappointments for farmers is the delay in executing the Thenpennai-Palar link project that was initiated in 2008-2009. Their repeated pleas to implement the project that would revive Palar have fallen on deaf ears.The project envisages diverting flood water from the existing Krishnagiri reservoir from Nedungal to Palar river via Kallaru through a link canal of nearly 54 km length. This is a question of livelihood of hundreds of farmers. If implemented, it will bring water into Palar river basin, recharge ground water and benefit 11,800 hectares of land, said A. C. Venkatesan, president of Tamil Nadu Pasumai Paadhukaapu Makkal Iyakkam.In fact, the State government had announced that it would spend on the project if the Centre does not allocate funds as it is an intra-State project.But nothing moved on. It is a huge disappointment that no political party is talking about this project. Leaders talk about delta farmers, protecting Thamirabharani, Cauvery, Mullaiperiyar but not Palar, he added.Farmers also want scientific methods to be implemented to restore lands that have bore the brunt of tannery effluent discharge.CompensationThey also want affected farmers to be properly compensated. Another demand of sugarcane farmers is immediate settlement of arrears by the three cooperative sugar mills.An agricultural expert said Vellore is also facing shortage of seeds, and there was a need to strengthen government farms.Despite receiving good rainfall last November, a huge volume of water was lost to the sea. The government should construct check dams, at least one for every two kms, on Palar, he added."

Temperatures of over 27 degree Celsius (80 degree Fahrenheit) in combination with high humidity can affect the body, medication and testing supplies.Senior ESI Hospital physician and epidemiologist T.V. Narayana Rao said that there is a sudden increase in the number of diabetic patients that are being hospitalised. This is typical of the summer season. Blood sugar levels go out of control as the mercury rises, he said.Endocrinologist who specialises in diabetes Gowtham Meher said that sugar levels go up further especially for those who have borderline, uncontrolled blood sugar levels, in summer. The main reasons for the shooting up or in some cases plummet because of dehydration and infections. Diabetics are prone to dehydration because they need more fluids than normal persons. One of the symptoms of diabetes was frequent urination. In summer, dehydration causes the sugar levels to go up and therefore the frequency of urination. This causes a downward spiral and blood sugar levels go out of control, he explained.Infections like diarrhoea and gastroenteritis also led to increase in blood sugar levels, Dr. Gowtham said. For those who use insulin, there was an external reason  in summer the Insulin becomes ineffective if it is not maintained in temperatures of between 4 and eight degrees Celsius. Those travelling with insulin should not put it in a hot car. It should be kept in a cooler place, but not directly on ice or a gel pack. Testing supplies were also vulnerable to heat, he said.The guidelines of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say diabetics need to make changes in their medication and what they eat and drink when temperatures rise.Other suggests are: drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to avoid dehydration; don't wait until youre thirsty: it's a sign you're already dehydrated; avoid sugar-sweetened drinks such as sweet tea and sodas; know the signs of heat-related illness and how to respond to symptoms; Wear sunscreen and use a lip balm with sunscreen; wear loose-fitting, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing; Get physical activity in air-conditioned areas, or exercise outside early or late in the day, during cooler temperatures and use your airconditioner or go to air-conditioned buildings in your community to stay cool."
