But, there is not much awareness that hyperglycaemia lowers their immunity and turns them vulnerable to viral and bacterial infection.A 46-year-old man had urinary infection that worsened to the point of epididymo-orchitis (inflammation of the testes) because his blood glucose level was not under control. The only option left was to remove a severely affected testis, as pus accumulation and pain worsened. The man did not realise that something as common as a urinary infection could turn disastrous because of high blood glucose level.It is important for diabetics to know that they are immunity-compromised if the sugar level is not under control, says M.V. Vimal, consultant endocrinologist at Aster MIMS Kozhikode. Diabetics must be sensitised by their doctors to their vulnerability to bacterial and viral infection, just as they are told of the diabetic foot and end-organ damage.Importance of hygieneTotal hygiene must be maintained by diabetics, especially genital hygiene because high glucose in urine is a stimulus for bacteria, the doctor explains. Fluid intake must be high to flush out microorganisms.Bacterial infectionsBacterial infections such as the highly antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus that spreads through touch and manifests as boils or blisters will take a longer time to be cured in diabetics.The reason why these people are more vulnerable to infections is microorganisms thrive in a high glucose environment that causes immune dysfunction.Dr. Vimal points at the reciprocal factor wherein high blood sugar aggravates the infection. In turn, the infection pushes up hyperglycaemia.DengueDiabetics run a higher risk of mortality than non-diabetics when they contract the viruses that cause dengue and A (H1N1) influenza. Recovery in dengue-affected diabetics is slower than in non-diabetics because the food restrictions slow down restoration of platelet count to normal level.Platelet countThe drop in platelet count is faster in diabetics, fluid balance management becomes difficult in them and they require longer hospitalisation.(Reporting byK.V.

The other idea which was suggested at the meeting was to reward the public sector bank employees with Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), he said.Government is considering (the proposal of ESOP for bank employees). It is in very advanced stage... It has been long standing demand, and is (under) an active consideration, Jaitley said. With regard to the rising NonPerforming Assets or bad loans, Jaitley said that besides strengthening the institutional mechanism, the government has been taking sector specific decisions to deal with the problems in segments like power, highways, sugar and steel.Giving details of the deliberations during the conclave, Jaitley said there are suggestions to amend SARFAESI ACT and also expedite the DRT process by some more amendments to law.The Department of Financial Services is working in that direction and work is in fairly advanced stage, he said, adding that DRT will become the countrys first online court. We are anxiously waiting for report of the Joint Committee on Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law. That will create a structural and institutional mechanism which will help the bank as lenders, the minister said.On the NPA situation in the banking sector, Jaitley said banks are taking steps to recovery bad loans. As far as recovery is concerned, whatever steps have to be taken with regard to recovery banks have various rights for recovery through DRT, SDR... Neither loan waiver has been given to anyone, nor will be given, he said.In the current global environment, Jaitley said, banks have to take all the measures in order to clean up their books by effecting recoveries. He also said that there are some sector specific decisions which are required to be taken by the government. These include, power, highways, sugar and steel.To a question related to setting up of a bad bank, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said the issues related to asset reconstruction companies and stressed assets were discussed.

Notably, Indians have the lowest lung function in the world even after adjusting for our smaller body size. The importance of this paper is that it shows for the first time that high levels of insulin are directly damaging the lung structure and function, Dr. Agrawal told The Hindu .Recently, there have been a number of studies showing that when adjusted for body size, Indians have among the smallest lungs in the world or nearly a third smaller than a white European of similar size. This means a reduced efficiency to filter oxygen from ingested air, an accelerated decline in lung function with age as well as an increased propensity to contract respiratory diseases.Diabetes has emerged as a serious disease burden for India over the past two decades. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington reports that while diabetes rate has increased by around 45 per cent globally, it jumped 123 per cent in India between 1990 and 2013. The International Diabetes Federation showed that nearly 6.9 crore people in India were suffering from diabetes in 2015 and their ranks are expected to swell to 12.5 crore by 2040.Dr. Agrawal and his colleagues arrived at their conclusion through tests on mice, which were fed with insulin to levels proportionate with what human diabetics on insulin medication would have. The scientists then found changes in the mice lungs that are known to be associated with the onset of diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The researchers then reinforced their findings by examining samples of human lung tissue that were treated with excessive insulin and saw an abundance of two kinds of tissue  primary human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells and induced collagen  that are known to indicate deteriorating lung quality.Whats disconcerting, according to Dr. Agrawal, is that most medicines to treat diabetes attempt to control the excess blood sugar by pumping in ever-increasing quantities of insulin into the body. That only makes matters worse. Theres no solution to this other than exercise and a diet that strikes a balance between protein and carbohydrates, he said."

The summer months could still be distant, but the water situation in Maharashtra, particularly in Marathwada, has already hit a worrisome low.The demand for tankers has shot up and the State is staring at an acute water shortage for the third consecutive year, worse than even 2015. In Marathwada, the water level in dams has dropped to 8%. And the Water Supply and Sanitation Department has recorded a five-fold rise compared to 2015 in the number of water tankers supplied to provide water in villages and hamlets.The water storage situation is dismal, said Babanrao Lonikar, Minister for Water Supply and Sanitation.While we have ensured that the available water is stored for drinking purpose only, a number of measures such as Jalyukta Shiwar are in progress to ensure groundwater level increases in drought affected areas.Mr Lonikar also announced a new rural water supply scheme, which will be presented in the State cabinet next week. The CM and Finance Minister have agreed to allocate Rs 600 crore for this new scheme, which will be aimed at recharging ground water and improving present water storage.The water situation in other parts of the State such as North Maharashtra, Amaravati and Nagpur division is also bad. The current storage level in dams in these divisions is 31%, 35% and 37% respectively.Pradeep Purandare, ex-associate professor at Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI), told The Hindu that the situation is only lending itself to a brisk business opportunity for tanker owners and bottled water industries. Private tankers charge anything ranging between Rs 500 and Rs 1,200. There are absolutely no regulations on bottled water industry. We have even asked the Chief Minister to publish a white paper on this industry as it is controlled by local politicians and rich landlords, he said.According to him, cities such as Latur, Udagir and Osmanabad are already suffering due to water shortage. Mr Purandare, a well-known researcher in water issues, said the government must also immediately ban use of water for water intensive crops such as sugarcane. Meanwhile, Mr Lonikar informed that the government has also issued clear directives to sugar mills to ensure drip irrigation in the sugarcane farms."

VenkatachalapathyCrossing the Chennai-Bangalore National Highway-48 near Sathuvachari has for long been a nightmare for pedestrians. But this is set to change in the coming months, as the long-felt need for a subway across the NH will soon become a reality.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has given its nod to construct a subway enabling pedestrians to cross the six-lane NH at the Regional Transport Office (RTO) Road point at Sathuvachari. Residents have been demanding for a subway for more than six years now.From being NH-46, the Chennai Bangalore NH was recently re-numbered as NH-48 as part of a nation-wide exercise.Bhoomi pujaWith the bhoomi puja for the subway works held on Monday, officials said excavation works for the subway will begin after certain preliminary works are completed.Encroachments have to be removed from the service lanes on either sides of the NH. We need to shift certain utilities such as major Ponnai water pipelines and electricity lines. We will then widen the service lanes to allow the local traffic to flow, and divert the main traffic from the NH into the service lanes, said an official.Once the preliminary works are completed, he added that it will take about three months from the date of commencing work to complete the subway. The excavation for the subway on the NH will be carried out for a depth of 3 m and width of 5 m. The subway will be built for a length of 51 m, he added. Officials said the subway will come up at a cost of around Rs. two crore.Useful for cyclists tooIn fact, the subway will come up in such a way that even cyclists would be able to utilise it. We will be providing a ramp to enable physically challenged persons to use the subway, he said.Officials said the work that will be carried out by L & T has been agreed upon for public cause as it was a long-pending demand.M. Abdul Rahman, former Member of Parliament, Vellore had taken up the need to establish a subway at this junction during his tenure 2009-2014.Residents brought this issue to my notice as there were several fatal accidents at this spot. They had also resorted to stage road blockade then to draw the attention of the government, he said.He had raised this issue in the Parliament eight times, and represented during the visit of then Union Road Transport and Highways Minister to Vellore in 2012.Demands from publicThere have been demands from public in various parts of the district for underpasses or flyovers on the NH. A demand for an underpass near Ambur Sugar Mill surfaced a few years ago."

They have been promising us that the State government would shortly release compensation for the loss of horticulture crops in Basavakalyan and other taluks.He complained that the Agriculture Department officials had not conducted a scientific survey of crop loss. While the total crop loss suffered by farmers in the district was around Rs. 200 crore, the State government had released only Rs. 89 crore, he said. KRRS leader Srimant Birdadar said the Congress would lose the next elections if it continued to neglect farmers. To this, the Chief Minister said the government was committed towards farmers welfare and would stand by them at all times.Another farmers leader Vishwanath Patil Koutha complained that the State government was quiet when sugar factories were not paying the State-recommended fair and remunerative prices to sugarcane growers. Why is the State government not taking action against factories that were openly defiant about paying the right prices to farmers? he asked.When the Chief Minister said that the factories had obtained a stay on the FAR prices, the leaders shot back asking why the officials and government advocates had not anticipated such a move. They asked the government to pay the arrears of factories, but Mr. Siddaramaiah said the model code of conduct was in place and he could not announce any welfare measure or package for farmers.Special Cabinet meetingHe, however, said that a special Cabinet meting would be convened to discuss the problems of farmers. I will ask the Chief Secretary to request all bankers to convert short-term loans into long-term ones, the Chief Minister said. Action will be taken against banks that charge higher interest for what are supposed to be zero per cent loans. He said no factory could avoid paying the FAR prices.Other members of the KRRS complained that the State government was only making promises, but never serious about their implementation.Government is committed towards farmers welfare and will stand by them at all times: CM"

He means to say that ministers who are insensitive to the problems of the people should be replaced, Mr. Siddaramaiah said.He was speaking to presspersons ahead of a road show for the bypoll to the Bidar Assembly constituency. Rahim Khan is the Congress candidate for the election.AllegationMr. Siddaramaiah said that the Union government had not included all the cities recommended by the State for developing as smart cities.They have left out some cities from the list as they did not confirm to the rules. They are blaming me for their decision. That is wrong, he said.Mr. Siddaramaiah denied the allegations by Union Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu that he had not attended meetings convened by the Prime Minister and the Union Urban Development Ministry.He said that the State government would ensure that the sugar factories paid the fair and remunerative price fixed by the government to growers.They cannot avoid paying it. A special cabinet meeting will be held after the bypolls to discuss the issues related to farmers, the Chief Minister said.Asked about the former Chief Minister H.D.

The work, which commenced in December, aims at construction of the compound to a length of 100 metres and for a height of 10 metres.We have brought the boulders needed for the compound from the adjoining hilly area. We ensure that the original methodology with regard to materials is adopted, so that the grandeur is retained, a source told The Hindu here on Monday.This was the fourth phase of renovation. Earlier, the damaged parts of the fort were re-built. The fort has two major temples dedicated to Sri Sathyamurthy- Sri Uyyavanda Nachiar (Vaishnavite) and Sri Sathyagireeswarar-Sri Venuvaneeswari (Saivite). In the earlier phases, the three-tier merlon  at the top, middle and base of the fort  were renovated. Clearing of vegetation with stronger roots such as banyan using a tree-killer, a non-chemical substance, was a major achievement. This was followed by the strengthening work, involving a series of reinforcing processes  crouting, pointing and brickwork and plastering. Details were worked out for the renovation of the merlons. They were strengthened using lime, terminlia chevula (kadukkai) and palm sugar (panai vellam). To protect the pushkarani at the fort, the ASI has set up a chain-link, which would prevent straying of cattle."

Photo: M. PeriasamyResidents of Kallipalayam Panchayat on Monday presented a petition at the collectorate grievance day stating that letting out of waste water by a private dairy unit had resulted in pollution of ground water in the entire vicinity.The residents, displaying the poor quality of ground water, said that the families reside 3 km away from Kurumbapalayam at a place known as Pethanaickenpalayam.Recently, when a group of residents sunk a bore well to commence construction of own houses, they were shocked to see polluted water yield. Similarly, the water drawn from a 780 ft bore well sunk by the panchayat to cater to the drinking water needs was also found to be extremely polluted.Residents suspected the dairy firm to be letting the waste water into bore wells sunk for the purpose of draining the waste water.This had resulted in college students vacating the place and senior citizens suffering from health ailments. Residents accused the dairy firm of intimidating the residents and silence on the part of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.Action soughtRepresentatives from Coimbatore Ramanathapuram Diocese  Holy Trinity Cathedral led by Chancellor George sought action against those who trespassed into Snehalaya, home for those inflicted with HIV and unleashed an attack.The delegation, in a petition, also pointed out that trespassers in a bid to justify their actions were levelling allegations against the home and its administrators.Meanwhile, members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) presented a petition to the Collector seeking stringent action against those who unleashed a brutal murderous attack on those who went to question the alleged ill-treatment and torture meted out to inmates of Snehalaya a home for those inflicted with HIV.Those who were tried to rush hospitals in car were chased and attacked, the petition said.Self-immolation bidAmmasai of Annur created a flutter at the collectorate when she doused kerosene on herself and attempted self-immolation protesting against delay in survey of the land that belonged to her husband.Ammasai said that her husband Arumugam inherited 4.5 cents from his father and when the family tried to transfer the title deed in their name, the revenue officials reportedly denied title deed. Revenue officials said that only 2.25 cents belonged to them and the rest were poromboke lands, she alleged.She lamented that her petitions at various levels over the last eight months yielded no result, hence she was forced to resort to extreme decision.Police personnel removed her for inquiry.Regulate unskilled paramedical staffMembers of the Coimbatore District Para-Medical Lab Educational Institution Welfare Association urged the administration to regulate unskilled and those without training conducting sugar test, blood pressure and even pregnancy tests at medical shops and also by putting up kiosks in public places and along the roadside. If such practices were allowed to continued, the use of un-sterilised tools could lead to spreading of contagious diseases, they expressed concern.Permission soughtEnvironmental activist K.S. Arumugam of Sundarapuram urged the district administration grant permission for conducting an event on February 28. He turned up with garlands made of water hyacinth leaves. Mr. Arumugam wanted to bicycle along the banks on water hyacinth on February 28 in a bid to create awareness on the ill-effects of hyacinth and also to enter the Limca book of records.Probe demandedResidents of Kittampalayam near Karumathampatti thronged the collectorate with placards demanding a probe into alleged irregularities in the village panchayat."

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyCrossing the Chennai-Bangalore National Highway-48 near Sathuvachari has for long been a nightmare for pedestrians. But this is set to change in the coming months, as the long-felt need for a subway across the NH will soon become a reality.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has given its nod to construct a subway enabling pedestrians to cross the six-lane NH at the Regional Transport Office (RTO) Road point at Sathuvachari. Residents have been demanding for a subway for more than six years now.From being NH-46, the Chennai Bangalore NH was recently re-numbered as NH-48 as part of a nation-wide exercise.Bhoomi pujaWith the bhoomi puja for the subway works held on Monday, officials said excavation works for the subway will begin after certain preliminary works are completed.Encroachments have to be removed from the service lanes on either sides of the NH. We need to shift certain utilities such as major Ponnai water pipelines and electricity lines. We will then widen the service lanes to allow the local traffic to flow, and divert the main traffic from the NH into the service lanes, said an official.Once the preliminary works are completed, he added that it will take about three months from the date of commencing work to complete the subway. The excavation for the subway on the NH will be carried out for a depth of 3 m and width of 5 m. The subway will be built for a length of 51 m, he added. Officials said the subway will come up at a cost of around Rs. two crore.Useful for cyclists tooIn fact, the subway will come up in such a way that even cyclists would be able to utilise it. We will be providing a ramp to enable physically challenged persons to use the subway, he said.Officials said the work that will be carried out by L & T has been agreed upon for public cause as it was a long-pending demand.M. Abdul Rahman, former Member of Parliament, Vellore had taken up the need to establish a subway at this junction during his tenure 2009-2014.Residents brought this issue to my notice as there were several fatal accidents at this spot. They had also resorted to stage road blockade then to draw the attention of the government, he said.He had raised this issue in the Parliament eight times, and represented during the visit of then Union Road Transport and Highways Minister to Vellore in 2012.There have been persistent demands from public in various parts of the district for underpasses or flyovers on the NH. A demand for an underpass near Ambur Sugar Mill surfaced a few years ago."

The exercise begins with identifying those who have gone in search of work and the means to get them to vote on the polling day falling on February 13.The ruling party TRS is not leaving any stone unturned in its effort to get people to vote for their candidate. Jadav Vithal Naik, sarpancah of Kangti village is one among the number of grassroots leaders who have been entrusted the job of identifying the migrant labour, where they are located currently and influencing them to come to their respective villages to cast their vote.Vithal Naik has been trying to contact them over phone or in person by sending someone to request them to come on February 13 to their native village and cast their vote. Those migrated were being offered even transport charges as well as a gesture.He says that about 100 families have migrated in the past two months to Kamareddy in Nizamabad, while some have gone to work in sugar factories located in Karnataka and Maharashtra in addition to Hyderabad where they are found to be employed in some labour jobs.Similar conditions are prevailing at many villages. We are trying to bring as many as possible on the day of polling and efforts are on. We are not sure how many would come for polling, Mr. Vithal Naik told The Hindu.It was estimated that more than 20,000 voters have migrated from the constituency for various works including cutting sugarcane. The has cited two reasons for the exodus. One is for cutting sugarcane which is a seasonal job and is routine around this time of the year and secondly it is the serious drought condition which is pushing people out of their villages in search of jobs.TransportationEfforts are being put not only by the TRS, but also by the opposition Congress and Telugu Desam Party. However, being led by Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao the TRS has been moving aggressively in this regard and it was stated that even transport vehicles would be arranged a day before the polling as well as the polling day to bring the migrant voters to their native villages.One more worry haunting the political parties is that of Pandari Maha Padayatra to begin in the next few days. There would be scores of people from every village participating in the yatra and would return only after the day of polling.Elections are being held following the demise of Congress MLA P. Kista Reddy"

With over three lakh hectare under sugarcane cultivation, Tamil Nadu was the fourth largest sugar producing state in the country, he said.Sugarcane prices must be determined in relationship to the sugar mill revenues, he said If still there a gap between what the mills can pay (for the cane) and the state governments State Advised Price, it should be filled bythe state.The state had four lakh farmers and 45 sugar mills. Tamil Nadu accounts for seven to nine per cent of the countrys total sugar production of 260 lakh tonne.For the 12-month period ended September 2015, it produced nearly 12 lakh tonne against its production capacity of 30 lakh tonne sugar. The area under sugarcane cultivation had reduced to 50-60 per cent of what it was a few years ago, resulting in under-utilisation of capacities.Sugarcane prices have been increased by 60 per cent by the Union government in the last five years.Currently, the Tamil Nadu government has fixed the State Advised Price at Rs.2,850 per tonne for 2015-16 sugar season, which was Rs.550 more than the Fair and Remunerative Price fixed by the Centre. This was the highest in the country, if one considered the sugar recovery ratio, he said.At an average of 9.2 per cent sugar recovery rate in the state, the production cost per quintal of sugar works out to Rs.3,100.Compare this with the current ex-mill sugar price in Tamil Nadu of around Rs.2,850 per quintal, and one would understand how bad the situation is for the sugarcane mills and sugarcane farmers, Mr. Verma said.According to ISMA, sugar mills in Tamil Nadu were located close to the port and had quick access to Sri Lanka. But out of about six lakh tonne of white sugar imported by Sri Lanka, India was able to meet about 50 per cent. The balance was met by Brazil. India was unable to take advantage of the situation because of high sugarcane costs.Mr. Verma urged the state government to develop a model followed by other states to ensure that the sugarcane farmers got their payments on time and if required, assist the mills in the payment especially when the revenue realisation was poor.Calling for removal of five per cent VAT on sugar, he said it raised the cost of sugar produced in Tamil Nadu, which was already high due to low sugar recovery. It thus made it all the more uncompetitive as revenue loss for mills was over Rs.200 crore a year.The policies on sugarcane and sugar, including the by-products should be reviewed and carefully re-formulated."

58f8bf38a3d24b0b70c3a284,Strawberry fields forever,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/strawberry-fields-forever/article8196526.ece,2016-02-05,"I love strawberries. Their siren red and vibrant green colours are so riveting that I find it impossible to walk past strawberries on sale. Yes I know. There really is nothing new to write about strawberries. They are so well-loved that we have pretty much figured out every possible way to savour their beautiful berryness.But I have been ordering strawberries by the kilo from Love Thy Farmer, a local initiative that delivers quality fruit from farms around Mumbai to your doorstep. And I cant think of anything else.Its hard to believe the kilos of strawberries I am going through. When I was a child, strawberries were an expensive indulgence. We never really got to just eat them whole as is. They would always be blended into milkshake or chopped into a fruit custard so everyone got a share. Thats probably why I cannot get enough of them even now.The last time I spent a strawberry season totally obsessed was years ago when I spent the most idyllic strawberry season of my life in North India. We were living in Chandigarh and often drove up to Dehradun through roads flanked by strawberry farms. Strawberries hadnt gained the popularity they now have in the area, yet and one could easily buy a kilo or more at a mere Rs15. I bought kilos and kilos worth and tried them in every way possible.There really is no best way to savour strawberries, its more a matter of mood. The fact that they pair well with so many things makes them even more versatile. And at just 45 calories for every 150 gm there is no healthier way to sin. (Although accompaniments will add calories).But dont mind me, dip whole in molten chocolate, slice into sweetened cream, macerate with sugar and mint and serve as is or over ice cream, better yet spoon into a glass of champagne! These days, strawberries are a favourite breakfast brightener in our home; sliced over pancakes or waffles, chopped into cereal or quickly zapped into a compote to enjoy over bread pancakes or even to stuff crpes . Simply sprinkle with sugar and zap it in the microwave (this also works well with citrus fruit like oranges and grapefruit). A dusting of cinnamon while still warm and a drizzle of wine prior to cooking and you are ready to party!Strawberry reds glamorise anything. Salads for one. For a vinegar that injects the addictive flavours of strawberry into salads, just place cleaned, hulled berries into a wide-mouthed bottle, cover with champagne vinegar and forget for a few weeks; then decant into another bottle and enjoy! Of course strawberries lend themselves best to sweet accents. The easiest, quickest thing you can do with strawberries is drizzle a sauce over them. Caramel works well in a pinch, but try hung yoghurt, or a chilli or pepper-laced balsamic.But my all time favourite way with strawberries is to macerate them with pepper vodka. Quarter a whole lot of the berries, sprinkle over with a little sugar, douse with a generous measure of pepper vodka, mix well, mashing a little as you go, and chill. Enjoy as is, or make a simple but stunning dessert by layering with whipped cream or thick custard. Spoon into individual shot glasses or do a large bowl. Some like this with a bit of chocolate flakes or chocolate sauce drizzled over.I also freeze this mixture to enjoy long after the season is over, as an impromptu sorbet in the summer. But when, I am having my strawberries with chocolate I want the combination uncluttered. For that just, simply pile oodles of washed berries onto a large platter with a bowl of hot chocolate sauce to dip in; you can get fancy and try milk, white and bitter chocolate sauces too.The writer is a food consultant, writer, stylist and author of A Pinch of This, a Handful of That"

C. Parija on Thursday launched the 3-D Printer Technology at the hospitals department of plastic surgery.The Plastic Surgery Department had, shortly before commissioning the equipment, successfully recreated a human hand and demonstrated the potential of the technology.3-D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to various processes used to synthesize a three-dimensional body parts. In 3-D printing, successive layers of material are formed under computer control to create any body parts. These body parts can be of almost any shape and are produced from a 3-D model or other electronic data source.These 3-D printable models can be created with a computer aided design (CAD) package, via a 3-D scanner or by a plain digital camera and photogrammetry software.Dr. Parija noted that with the help of this technology---which he said is a first for Government sector hospitals in south India--doctors would be able to prepare replicas various body parts in the laboratory to study and plan surgeries.In the clinical realm, 3-D printing has been used to print patient specific implant and device for medical use. The hearing aid and dental models are also area of application using the custom 3-D printing Technology.Doctors said new research is focused on methods to bio-print replacements for lost tissue due to arthritis and Cancer. The technology can now be used to make exact replicas of organs.The printer uses images from patients MRI or CT scan images as a template and lays down layers of rubber or plastic. With this process, doctors can bio-print a prosthetic hand or a precisely calibrated replica of any other body part using inkjet techniques. Layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures including vascular systems.Even medical pills can be manufactured for delivering large amount of medicine using this technology, said Dr Ashok Badhe, Jipmer Deputy Director.According to him, patients with respiratory problems can also be helped by developing accurate size and shape of tracheal splint.This technology is particularly useful for Plastic Surgeons for reconstructing damaged, mutilated and lost body part. Dr. Ravi Kumar Chittoria, Head of Department of Plastic Surgery, underscored the contribution of Dr. Dinesh Kumar S, Associate Professor of Plastic Surgery who has a special interest in 3-D Printer Technology and has started a research project on this technology.Doctors would be able to prepare replicas of body parts and plan surgeries"

The SAP includes Rs. 100 per tonne as cost for transporting sugar.The South Indian Sugar Mills Association (SISMA) had said that paying any higher price over FRP would be beyond the means of sugar mills.The government should ensure that the State government order should be implemented fully by the private sugar mills, said R.

The risk of cardiovascular disease is also high. In women followed up for 20 years, up to 70 per cent of those who had GDM went on to develop diabetes.Listing out these facts, chairperson of World Diabetes Foundation Anil Kapur told The Hindu that high blood sugar during pregnancy not only increases the risk for poor pregnancy outcome, stillbirths, low-birth weight or pre-term babies but also puts the newborn at high risk. High blood sugar level during pregnancy needs to be tackled before and beyond pregnancy, he said.V. Seshiah, chairman of the DIPSI, said there was a need to take up awareness on GDM on war-footing as the increasing number of gestational diabetes cases in the country was an alarming trend which cannot be ignored.Hema Divakar, co-chair for International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics GDM Working Group, said in a survey conducted by ARTIST had revealed that approximately 10 per cent of women, who get pregnant every year, developed diabetes during the gestation period.We intend to launch a campaign on awareness, prevention, early recognition and care of high blood sugars (hyperglycaemia) not only during pregnancy but also before and beyond, she said, and added that March 10 would be observed as GDM Day.In a nutshellWomen with gestational diabetes mellitus have five times higher risk of developing type-2 diabetes within five yearsGestational diabetes also increases risk for poor pregnancy outcomeDoctors advise healthy eating habits and regular physical activityThey recommend universal testing of all expectant women for GDM"

He said that the action of the Commissioner for Cane Development and Director of Sugars issuing guidelines for fixing harvesting and transportation charges at Rs. 850 per tonne with additional diesel charges was anti-farmer and pro-sugar factories.He said that the harvesting and transportation charges fixed in the guidelines issued by the Commissioner were a replica of what was being followed illegally by sugar factories which deducted Rs. 800 to Rs. 1,000 per tonne as harvesting and transportation charges. The guidelines also provide flexibility for increasing the harvesting and transportation charges.The State government and the Commissioner, who had failed to ensure that the sugar factories adhered to the Fair and Remunerative Prices fixed by the Union government for 2014-15 and 2015-16, have now sounded the death knell to sugarcane growers by issuing the guidelines on March 1 this year.Mr. Patil said that the farmers were to get Rs. 550 crore as per the Fair and Remunerative Prices from sugar factories for sugarcane supplied in 2013-14 and Rs. 500 crore for sugarcane supplied in 2014-15.Mr. Patil said that the March 1 guidelines based on the prevailing diesel prices was in contrary to the harvesting and transportation charges fixed in December 2014 by the government.The price of diesel per litre was Rs. 54.92 in December 2014, but the price of diesel has come down to Rs. 48.47 per litre now.Instead of reducing harvesting and transportation charges, the guidelines have provided for increasing the charges ranging from 15 per cent to 30 per cent of the charges levied on sugarcane growers in 2014.If the transportation charges in 2014-15 were Rs 55.83 to Rs. 103.83 (40 km to 120 km) in 2015-16, the factories deducted Rs. 101.86 to Rs. 149.85 for the same distances at a time when the price of diesel had come down. Harvesting and transportation charges have increased by nearly 1,000 per cent due to the unscientific fixation of charges by factories."

Balan (40), being publicly thrashed by the police for defaulting two instalments of a loan availed from a private bank to purchase a tractor went viral. The incident occurred on March 4 but became public only on Wednesday and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has taken cognisance of the same.Balans family in Cholagankudikadu village in Thanjavur district is distraught. Initially, Balan had told his family members that police personnel took him to the police station regarding the tractor loan he had availed from Kotak Mahindra Bank and that they had let go of him after wresting an assurance that he would pay up the arrears soon. However, when they saw the video footage of Balans brutal assault by the police and the banks agents, which went viral on social media and mobile messaging platforms, his family got to know the full truth.On Thursday, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), taking suo motu cognisance of the incident, issued notices to the Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police to explain why the action was taken.Balan had borrowed Rs.3,80,430 in 2011 from the Thanjavur Branch of the Kotak Mahindra Bank. He has so far repaid in six half yearly instalments of Rs. 68,543 each, a sum of Rs. 4,11,200 and needed to pay only two instalments when crop failure in successive seasons hit him like other delta farmers, forcing him to default on repayment.According to him, the banks agents harassed him to pay the money. On March 4, around a dozen agents of the bank along with Inspector of Police, Pappanadu, Kumaravel, and some other police personnel intercepted Balan at his field, assaulted him and took forcible possession of his tractor  all of which were recorded unknown to others and later shared on WhatsApp.I had never previously borrowed any money from banks but I rue the day I gave in to the sustained three-month pestering by the agents of Kotak Mahindra Bank agents and took a loan, claims Balan. I was required to pay just two more instalments when I got beaten up, he says, adding that he has preferred a petition with the Thanjavur district administration seeking action against those who assaulted him. In availing the tractor loan, I lost my money first and now my honour as well as peace of mind, he says.My son took a loan for buying a tractor. Now look at what fate has befallen him. A hard worker, Balan hid the fact that he was beaten up and dragged to the police station and simply said that he went to the station to clarify things lest I get worried. We set store by honour but the bank men and the police have thrashed not just Balan but our honour and respect, rues his mother Marikkannu at their house in the village, which incidentally lies next to the hometown of State Agriculture Minister R. Vaithilingam.In all my 75 years I have not seen such a treatment meted out to a farmer, Balans father Govindasamy notes. Wondering whether his son had deprived anyone of anything to be treated like a criminal, Mr. Govindasamy wryly says that though they had promised the bank to repay soon after harvest, the staff and the police had acted in collusion to assault him. Successive crop failure and delay in issuing cutting orders or sugar cane coupled with brief illness forced him to default on repayment, points out Mr. Govindasamy, saying that he will repay the loan.Meanwhile, taking a stern look at the incident, the NHRC has issued notices to the State Chief Secretary and the DGP. Stating that such form of forcible recovery by itself amounted to human rights violation and compounded the nature of the offence committed by those who assaulted the defaulting farmer. The officials have been asked to file their report in two weeks time.Justice D. Murugesan, Member, NHRC observed that it was common knowledge that private sector banks and financial institutions, to recover loans advanced to individuals and particularly farmers, used police to brutalise the defaulters. The intemperate and immoderate attitude of the bank officials and the involvement of the police in such forcible recovery was prevalent in several parts of the country, he noted in a release."

Even the buses and private vehicles, which started from the district headquarters and passing through Narayankhed, were heavily packed with passengers.All the political parties, particularly the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), have focused on brining the migrant labourers to their respective villages, and the responsibility was entrusted to their local leaders. In most of the cases, the transport was arranged by political parties. It was expected that a majority of around 30,000 people who migrated from the constituency have returned to participate in the voting."

These pests suck the sap of the plant resulting in the disease.However, Manohar Shetty, general secretary, Dakshina Kannada unit of Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha (KRRS), said that another reason for the reduction in cultivation area of harekala menasu is farmers switching over to sugarcane cultivation after sugar mill at Brahmavar, Udupi district, opened in 1986.It was because growing sugarcane was profitable. Even now sugarcane can be seen in some patches in Harekala, Pavoor and Amblamogaru, he added.Mr. Safaliga said that sugarcane attracted less disease when compared to chilli. He said that the price of this unique chilli hovered between Rs. 160 and Rs. 220 a kg. in 2015. Nursery preparation of plants usually begins in September and farmers plant them in November. The first harvest could be made three months after planting. It yielded till April-end. Harvest could be made on weekly basis and the yield varied from farm to farm, he said.Mr. Monteiro, said that he harvested about a quintal of chilli from 30 cents of land last year. There is shortage of labourers now both for planting and harvesting, Mr. Safaliga added."

And, you might end up with an infection by consuming sub-standard quality of water.This is typical in summer, as against other seasons when there is less desperation for drinking water, M. Sudheer, Head of the Department of General Medicine at Government General Hospital (Kozhikode Beach) said on Monday.Stomach, eye and skin ailments were common. The first one could be attributed to poor quality of water and food.Unsafe water poses the risk of viral Hepatitis A infection. We also see cases of acute diarrhoeal disease that will require intensive rehydration, he said.Some cases of chicken pox among children were reported a few days ago. There is no reason to raise an alarm as these were very few and sporadic cases.However, summer brings with it this risk, especially among children who play in groups during vacation, he said. Dehydration was a major problem across all age groups. But, the solution many opted for could be a classic case of the cure worse than the disease.Dr. Sudheer said that the approach of beating the heat with a beverage could prove counter-productive.Contrary to common belief, aerated soft drinks would not help re-hydration. These were high on sugar. What caused concern was that people were already hooked on to it.What they require is fluid with salt because water and sodium level depletion is high during summer.Tender coconut (it contains sodium) or lime juice with salt, or even our kanji with salt are ideal. We call these home available fluids, and these are the best options, he explained.According to the doctor, summer called for a bit of a lifestyle change to beat the heat.Dr. Sudheer said diabetics should be extremely careful with any skin ailment. We see some diabetics coming to our hospital every February-March with large heat-induced blisters or boils. If their sugar level is not under control, healing becomes very difficult, he said"

Its a sachet of herbs meant to alleviate symptoms of a raging cold and cough, and turns out to be a source of great relief to this writer. She chuckles, while saying, I have all kinds of medicines here. That Pathy is a raging multi-tasker is evident from her seamless ability to switch from ministering medicine to talking about her various passions.Founder of the India Design Forum, the third edition of which will be part of the Make in India week, Pathy wears multiple work hats. For starters, she heads Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals. Shes also chairperson of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)-South. And in 2012, Pathy launched the India Design Forum (IDF), an independent platform, the culmination of years of pursuing design in almost every sphere of her life.For Pathy, design dictates everything. And it especially means thinking outside of traditionally held ideas while still respecting them. Take for instance, the story behind her favourite design project: my own sugar factory. Years ago, when Pathy took over her familys sugar business, she made trade traditionalists sit up and pay attention to the radically changed design of her workspaces. Sugar factories are conventionally planned in a linear fashion, with lorries bearing sugarcane coming in on one end, and sugar coming out from the other. All of which required more supervision and manpower.Pathys design change, a square structure, meant more visibility, less monitoring and of course, increased output. The change was only made after visiting 12 factories and minutely studying the details. Pathy connects her ability to multi-task with her sugar business. From one stick of sugarcane, I can produce sugar, power, alcohol, ethanol, bio-fertilizer and bio-resin. I can also create schools and empower women. Which other business allows me this creativity?IDF aims to create awarenessShe says, What the IDF aims to do is to create awareness for the value of design in the manufacturing processes and design thinking. So, we get global thought leaders on design to speak on the same. The theme for IDF 2016 is Empowering through Design. She explains, This year, because IDF is part of the Make in India week, weve focused on industrial design as a large component of the programming. Its got product design elements in it as well, and architecture, which is what we do every edition.About curating the IDF 2016 programme, Pathy says, Its something that I am really keen on because its about giving the audience an idea of what India is capable of doing: all in a one-day capsule. This years line-up for IDF 2016 will be inaugurated with Isha Foundations Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, who will talk about Design of Life while discussing, through a slide show, the Dhyanalinga Meditative Space (at Isha Foundations Coimbatore campus) and its design. The centres elliptical Dhynalinga dome is the largest built in the last 100 years. Pathy is also thrilled at getting Shobu Yarlagadda, producer of Baahubali to talk about how thousands of people worked on the film to get its details right. Weve also got Matalie Crasset, an industrial designer from France. Crasset, who worked with Philippe Starck, and then started her own design studio, is very interested in designing schools for underprivileged children in third world countries. Pathy says, She is very interested in looking at schools in India and how using local material can create a healthy and inspiring place for kids. Other highlights include Polish designers Tomek and Gosia Rygalik and Marie Lundstrom from Ikea India.For Pathy, one of her aims through IDF is the need to steer Indian audiences down a more creative path.She explains, Post-independent India has removed the legacy of creativity from Indian society. We needed engineers, doctors and scientists to build an independent India. And now, almost 70 years later, you have a generation of people who are good at what they do but cannot think out of the box. We may have all the great IT companies but will we ever produce a Steve Jobs?To address this concern, Pathy is planning to set up a design school museum. But thats a long-term project and one that will take place after the dust settles on IDF2016.We have a generation of people who are good at what they do but cannot think out of the boxRajshree Pathy"

58f8fd8aa3d24b0b70c3c1f8,"Stop counting calories, check Glycemic Index",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stop-counting-calories-check-glycemic-index/article8247256.ece,2016-02-17,"The days of counting calories are over. The amount of carbs (carbohydrates) we consume does not matter as much as how quickly they get digested and get absorbed into the blood stream.The new parameter that could be checked is Glycemic Index, or GI for short. GI is a record of the total rise in a persons blood sugar level after consuming a particular food. GI can be used to explain how the body breaks down carbohydrates. It only takes into account the available carbohydrates (that is total carbohydrates minus fibre) in food. Although the food may contain fats and other components that contribute to the total rise in blood sugar, they do not reflect in GI. Foods with carbohydrates that break down more slowly, releasing glucose more gradually into the bloodstream, tend to have a low GI.The concept was developed by scientists of the University of Toronto in 1981 in the course of their research to find out as to which foods were the best for diabetics.City-based endocrinologist Goutham Meher says low GI foods are suggested primarily for those suffering from Type-I diabetes. The GI of fruits is low, and, therefore, they are good for diabetics, besides being weight watchers.Recent research has provided compelling evidence to prove that high-GI carbohydrates are associated with increased risk of obesity. A study done in 2012 showed that after weight loss, the energy expenditure was higher on low-GI diet when compared to a low-fat diet.Scientific evidence has shown that individuals who followed a low-GI diet over several years are at a significant lower risk of developing Type-2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and age-related muscular degeneration.On the other hand, high blood glucose levels or repeated glycemic spikes following a meal may promote the above diseases by increasing systemic glycemic stress.While the food we consume should have between 55 per cent and 60 per cent carbohydrates, carbohydrates in the rice-wheat diet in India is 80 per cent to 90 per cent. Cool drinks have the highest GI, with the entire sugar in them being absorbed immediately into the blood stream.He said all patients of Type-I diabetes have to monitor the GI of the substances they eat or drink and those having Type-II diabetes and are on insulin must also keep a close tab on GI. The GI of all food stuff is available on the internet, and those with smart phones could download apps that provide information, Dr. Meher says.GI is a record of the total rise in a persons blood sugar level after consuming a particular food, and it can be used to explain how body breaks down carbohydrates"

A major reason is that the blood vessels around the fracture, which deliver oxygen and nutrients to the cells, are also damaged, said Geert Carmeliet from University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. The ingrowth of new blood vessels into the implant takes time and until then, the cells are out of fuel since oxygen and nutrient supply is insufficient, she said.According to researchers, human body can repair bone fractures by itself in most cases. However, the bodys repair capacity is not sufficient in large bone fractures or defects, which often fail to heal without help.At the same time, the starved bone cells produce harmful oxygen radicals and thereby disturb the natural balance between antioxidants and oxygen radicals. An excess of these oxygen radicals causes irreversible cell damage, Ms. Carmeliet said.Reprogramming bone cells obtained from patients might increase their survival rate from 30 per cent to 60 per cent, which will ultimately lead to better bone regeneration, she said.Researchers tested in mice how they could better equip the bone cells for that crucial stage between implantation and ingrowth of the blood vessels.They managed to switch on a survival mode in bone cells by inactivating the oxygen sensor PHD2 before implantation.As a result, bone cells activate a dual defence mechanism. First, bone cells increase storage of an emergency fuel in the form of glycogen, which is in fact a sugar reservoir, said Steve Stegen, a doctoral student.In addition, bone cells start using glutamine  an amino acid  to produce more antioxidants to neutralise the increased production of harmful oxygen radicals, Mr. Stegen said.These two adjustments allow bone cells to be selfsupporting in terms of energy generation and to protect themselves against an increased level of oxygen radicals, he said.The oxygen sensor PHD2 can be inactivated via genetic engineering, and also by administering therapeutic molecules, Mr. Carmeliet said. The study was published in the journal Cell Metabolism .  PTIResearchers are developing implants of living bone cells that treat such injuries"

Even today, playing both hockey and cricket keeps me fresh, mentally and physically. So does playing hockey help her cricket?A lot of people talk about hockey and cricket and the obvious similarity is the hand-eye coordination. I do get told by the cricket coaches when I try to do a big hockey swing. Hockey has certainly helped in the long-range fitness and it is crucial especially in T20 cricket where it is so explosive and dynamic. Just before the London Olympics, Devine took a break from cricket to prepare for hockey but failed to make the cut. And that turned out to be a boost for the White Ferns as she was part of the first batch of women cricketers to be offered a contract by her board.Speaking about the decision to focus on cricket, I trained for the London Olympics, but missed out on the final squad. Around that time the first set of contracts came out for New Zealand cricket and it was too good to give up. That was definitely a reason to focus on cricket.Player without helmetDevine is also an exception in not choosing to wear a helmet while batting though she puts it down to comfort.Some people might call me stupid, but I have never worn one, even when I played boys cricket. It is about the comfort and being able to move. In hockey you stand exposed during drag-flicks near the net without much protection.Apart from juggling sports, Devine also has had to cope with a type-1 diabetic condition for more than a decade now.However, she says sports has helped her tackle her condition.It is a bit of a challenge sometimes, especially when you come to countries like India, where the weather plays a bit of factor on me personally with the diabetes.But, sport has played a massive part in controlling my diabetes, helped me regulate my blood sugar level."

Gyani said that this would help create awareness about the dangers of the lead poisoning.Dr. Gyani said that universities should stress more on research and ensure that research and innovations became a reality.Research scholars should go in for small innovations and make them a reality so that their toil and research help the society, he said. Professor Emeritus in Biochemistry T. Venkatesh said the campaign against lead poisoning wanted to create awareness among the people.N Shashidhara, national secretary general of Indian Society for Lead Awareness and Research, said that campaigns should be taken up in the schools and colleges.Arun J. Patil stressed the need for having lead testing facilities in all the district headquarters.He said that currently there was no monitoring of lead levels in the body in hospitals and it should be checked regularly like blood sugar levels.Vice-Chancellor of the university H.M. Maheshwaraiah presided over.Rajeev Joshi, of Innovation Club in the Central University of Karnataka, said that the centre would seek blood samples from cement factories, battery making units, mining industry and from all the schools to test the lead levels in the blood samples and prepare a data to enable the government and the authorities to take remedial measures."
58f91025a3d24b0b70c3cb5c,"Cane farmers slam Centre, State Governments",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cane-farmers-slam-centre-state-governments/article8250724.ece,2016-02-18,"Holding both the Central and State governments responsible for their plight, sugarcane farmers in the region have questioned the rationale behind the sugar mills refusing to heed to the Governments State Advised Price (SAP) over the last two years.According to representatives of farmers associations, the sugar mills in the state collectively owe Rs. 650 crore as dues on account of not implementing the SAP during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 crushing seasons.Tripartite meetingsThe revenue authorities, who hold tripartite meetings to prevail upon mills to settle dues, are able to ensure payment of the Fair and Remunerative Price fixed by the Central Government, but is helpless when it comes to settlement of SAP.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, Ministry of Agriculture, recommended FRP of Rs. 220 per quintal for the 2014-15 and Rs. 230 per quintal for 2015-16 crushing seasons. The SAP per tonne in Tamil Nadu was Rs. 650 during 2014-15 and was Rs. 550 during the current crushing season.There is a provision for the revenue authorities to issue notices and stall production of the mills if they fail to pay up the dues beyond permissible time, but there is no clarity as to whether the leverage could be exercised for failure on the part of the mills to settle SAP.This was due to an apparently contradictory stand on SAP taken by the Central Government. The Price Policy for Sugarcane released during 2014-15 by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) states that high SAP without commensurate increase in sugarcane productivity would make the Indian sugar sector globally uncompetitive.Stating that such a situation would lead to large excess stocks at home, and high cane arrears, bringing uncertainty and instability in sugar sector, and ultimately its fall, the CACP report advocated immediate adoption of the hybrid formula for pricing of sugarcane, which is composed of revenue sharing principle dovetailed with some Minimum FRP (MFRP).The revenue sharing principle will be to distribute the total revenue generated in the cane-sugar value chain from sugar and its first stage by-products (molasses, bagasse and press mud) produced from a quintal of sugarcane, between farmers and millers in the ratio of their relative costs (70:30) incurred in producing sugarcane and converting that sugarcane into sugar and by-products. If the value of by-products is loaded on the value of sugar, then this ratio comes to 75:25.UncertaintyGiven the uncertainty about future sugar prices, this revenue sharing principle needs to be combined with MFRP so that farmers are ensured of a minimum price. Adoption of this transparent and scientific hybrid formula as the basis of pricing of sugarcane will bring greater stability and rationality in the sugar sector. This, in turn, would attract fresh investments with new technology and take it to higher levels of efficiency and growth. Thus, the SAP needs to be phased out as it has lost its relevance,"" the report states.This being the case, farmers wonder why the SAP announcements are made if the State Government is not serious about securing the dues.ImpactThe impact of the downturn in sugar industry was perceptible in Tamil Nadu since the State accounts for one-tenth of sugar production in the country. Tamil Nadu ranks fourth in terms of sugarcane production with 10.8 per cent, after Uttar Pradesh (36.5 percent), Maharashtra 22 and Karnataka 10.9.Sugarcane farmers say a solution is possible to the present crisis if the mills are forthcoming about sharing revenue from the by-products."

Venkatesan claimed that a particular bridge was being built only after his party leader (Vijayakant) wrote to the Centre, which has sanctioned Rs 20 crore now, State Highways Minister claimed the credit should fully go to Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.Meanwhile, Rural Industries Minister P. Mohan, who hails from the district, asked Mr. Venkatesan to mention the fact that the present government has built three other bridges which were the long-pending demand of the people.The Treasury Bench also listed the allocations to the constituency in the past five years as the MLA complained of unfinished work in many projects and sought the town be upgraded as a municipality.He also asked the government address the woes of sugarcane farmers as the private sugar mills were not giving them the State Advised Price for two years now. Villupuram district had a large number of cane farmers, he added.

Value added tax had not been reduced. The allocation for industrial development was poor.The State government should have proposed to develop at least one industrial corridor in every district if not every taluk to give a push to industrial development. The government had banned use of plastic products, but not suggested any alternative.What will happen to so many traders in plastic industry. Industrialists, manufacturers pay so much tax. What do we get in return? Nothing, he said.B.V. Poojary, president of the district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, said that though the farmers of other parts of State might benefit from the budget, there was little for the farmers of Udupi district to cheer about. The prices of coconut and paddy had gone down.The sangh wanted the government to provide the farmers at least the cost of production.There was nothing in the budget to give impetus to the second phase of Varahi Irrigation Project.A lot of fields and plantations were subject to attack by wild animals in the district. But there is no solution for that problem either, he said.Japti Satyanarayana Udupa, farmer, said that there was no measure in the budget to rejuvenate the ailing Brahmavar Sugar Factory. There was no specific programme announced for rejuvenating agriculture in the district, he said.Kokkarne Surendranath Shetty, Associate Professor in Political Science, MGM College, said that the imposition of sales tax on petroleum products might increase the rate of petrol and diesel.

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMRestrictions in procuring ethanol and plummeting oil prices are working against the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) resuming its eco-friendly initiative of blending ethanol with diesel for running its buses.More than 50 per cent of the buses operated on intra-city routes in Mysuru used to run on blended fuel till a couple of years ago. This came to an end after KSRTC started buying diesel from retail stations because of the increase in diesel price for bulk consumers.Ethanol is produced from cane molasses, a by-product of the sugar production process. However, a public sector oil company restarted bulk diesel supply to KSRTCs fuel stations here a few months ago but the corporation is unable to restart blending due to technical issues.Besides in Mysuru, KSRTC buses were blended with ethanol in Bengalurus city transport services as well. KSRTC started experimenting with the ethanol-diesel blend a decade ago.When the fuel blending initiative was introduced, KSRTC was reckoned to be the countrys first public urban transport corporation to make use of the ethanol-diesel blend and bio-diesel to run its buses.Though the blending came to a halt more than a year ago, sources in KSRTC claimed it was stopped only six months ago as the old stocks of ethanol were used to blend with diesel but now fresh stocks had been procured. Sources told The Hindu that buses without high-performance engines (BS-1 and 2 series) run on blended fuel  fifteen per cent ethanol with diesel.But despite the availability of ethanol stocks, the blending was stopped as the retail fuel stations here lacked the ethanol-diesel blending arrangement while the KSRTCs depots had it. The increasing cost of ethanol, safety issues (storing is an issue without ethanol dispensers) and falling prices of diesel perhaps turned the green initiative unviable.Besides restrictions in procuring the product (with permission from the Excise Department), ethanols susceptibility to catch fire in summer, if it is not properly stored, and the lack of dispenser units are also cited as reasons for going slow on resuming the blending process.The buses that KSRTC has been procuring and those allotted under JNNURM comply with BS-4 norms and come with superior engines which cannot adjust with blended fuel. Such buses faced ignition problem in the past when we tried to run them on blended fuel, a source said.Whether the initiative comes back to life now depends on the centralised purchase policy KSRTC follows."

Venkaiah Naidu for not striving to realise special category status for Andhra Pradesh.Is he an Andhraite? He is not fighting for APs interests. Why did he not get the clause included in the Act? He should keep politics aside and do good for the State, Mr. Satyanarayana said addressing reporters after submitting a memorandum to the Collector seeking payment of dues amounting to Rs.7 crore to farmers by the Cooperative Sugar Factory at Govada (Chodavaram). He submitted the memorandum along with party leaders Gudivada Amarnath, Koyya Prasad Reddy, Karanam Dharma Sri, and Boddeda Prasad.This factory made profits in the past and a bonus of Rs.200 per tonne was paid. But the present rulers allowed it to slip into losses, he said. The rate to be paid now was Rs.175 per tonne, he said, and added that the YSRC would launch an agitation if the demand was not met by March 30.The YSRC leader also demanded payment of dues to farmers and employees of the Anakapalle cooperative sugar factory. He charged the government with trying to privatise every public sector industry or unit. He reiterated the partys demand for a separate railway zone for AP with headquarters in Visakhapatnam. He criticised the TDP and the BJP for making divergent statements on the issue."

Ajay Nagabhushan, Deputy Commissioner, has issued Recovery Certificates (RC) against four sugar mills, including the cooperative sector mill Pandavapura Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane (PSSK), for not clearing dues of sugarcane suppliers.These mills owe Rs. 236.34 crore to farmers who supplied cane during the crushing season 2014-15.The PSSK owes Rs. 29.82 crore to cane suppliers, while the private mill Chamundeshwari Sugars at Kala Muddana Doddi has to clear Rs. 66.48 crore. The private mill Coromandel Sugars at Makavalli, near K.R. Pet, that owes Rs. 56.42 crore and NSL Sugars at Koppa near Maddur that owes Rs. 83.62 crore, have also not cleared their dues to the cane suppliers.Mr. Nagabhushan, on February 22, had directed the managements of these mills to clear the dues before March 7.As the mills failed to pay the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) mandated by the government to the sugarcane suppliers, the Deputy Commissioner has issued the RCs, sources at the DC office said.ActionThe officer has also directed the tahsildars of Maddur, Pandavapura and K.R. Pet to initiate action with regard to the issue.According to sources, the defaulting mills have been directed to pay dues with interest at 15 per cent a year as per the Karnataka Sugarcane (Regulation of Purchase and Supply) Act 2013.

The Maharashtra government has given its green signal to export more sugar, and the prices are likely to go up by Rs 4 to 5.The government on Monday announced that cooperative sugar mills would be allowed to export 10 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of sugar, a move to ensure cash flow and help the mills pay fair and remunerative price (FRP) to sugarcane farmers. Sugar mills have been communicating to the government their inability to pay FRP to farmers citing paucity of funds.As it is, the sugar rates have increased from Rs 19 to 29. Following the decision, it is likely that prices will increase by Rs 4 to 5. However, consumers must understand that this is to ensure cash to farmers, said Cooperation Minister Chandrakant Patil.Mr Patil said the only way to check inflation is to sell sugar through the Public Distribution System (PDS). If people are ready to stand in queue to save two or three rupees, then we will think of selling it through PDS, he said, asking people to be considerate of the farmers condition, who are not getting FRP for their produce.The decision was taken at a meeting at the YB Chavan Centre, in the presence of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, former Agriculture Minister and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Ministers Pankaja Munde, Chandrakant Patil, and representatives of cooperative sugar mills.As per the Centres policy on sugar export, the country will be exporting approximately 40 lakh MT of sugar, of which 14 lakh MT will be Maharashtras contribution. Until now, only 3.98 lakh MT of sugar have been exported.Those sugar mills not complying with the order will not get exemption in purchase tax. However, drought-prone areas such Marathwada can be exempted, said Mr Patil.Brazil is one of the biggest exporters of sugar in the world. However, Brazils season is to begin two months later. We want to take the lead as we have enough storage available, he said.Among other benefits, sugar mills are exempt from purchase tax for 10 years, as they also generate electricity. The Centre pays around 10 per cent interest on the soft loans the mills take for one year, and the States pay the interest for the next four years. These benefits will be withdrawn if sugar is not exported."

Predominantly an investment destination for mineral-based industries due its rich mineral reserves, the eastern state has now started attracting companies from sectors including gems and jewellery, electronics, renewable energy and textile and apparel.The reasons are many: the state has moved up to the seventh position among Indian states in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business ranking. What has also helped is policy consistency under Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, supply of affordable but trained workforce, and the fact that Bhubaneswar recently topped the Smart Cities contest.At the recently-concluded Make in India Week held in Mumbai, the state government, for the first time, signed a number of memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with companies from non-mineral sectors, said top government officials. The government received investment proposals worth approximately Rs 71,000 crore, of which over Rs 18,000 crore was from non-mineral companies. These include a large sugar refinery and a fertilizer plant. A large diamond trading and jewellery manufacturing company has also committed to invest over Rs 1,000 crore in setting up a huge facility at Deras, near Bhubaneswar.We cannot disclose the name but it is one of Indias biggest players with global operations. Besides, we have received several proposals from companies which are into food processing, defence and apparel manufacturing to invest, Debi Prashad Mishra, Industry Minister, Odisha, told The Hindu.Chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi added, We have received proposals from companies into renewable energy. The diamond and jewellery company wants to set up base in Odisha as we have no shortage of skilled manpower. We have created a land bank of one lakh acres to cater to industrial needs.Thousands of people working in the diamond polishing and jewellery-making units in Surat are from Odisha, and they are keen to return to their home towns. This is one of the reasons gem & jewellery players are willing to shift part of their manufacturing to Odisha.ITC, which has never invested in Odisha, has committed Rs 800 crore in a food processing unit, a five-star hotel in Bhubaneswar and in social forestry.Since the cost of production in Western India is higher, lot many companies from non-mineral sectors are planning to set up base in Odisha in search of affordable work force. This is for the first time that we are witnessing this trend. It is heartening, said principal secretary, Industries, Sanjeev Chopra.Maggit, a UK-based company, has decided to set up a defence manufacturing unit at the Tata Steel SEZ at Gopalpur. The 3,000-acre SEZ is set to attract many companies from India and abroad.A Chinese delegation has shown interest in setting up an excusive industrial park for Chinese companies in Odisha.Officials said the states economic reform agenda is attracting companies to invest. It has introduced the eBiz portal, which covers 14 G2B (government to business) services with a common application form and an integrated payment gateway. This portal, a first of its kind in India, eliminates all physical interfaces for investment-related services.For a hassle-free business environment, the state has also introduced an online portal called Common Inspection Framework and is formulating a start-up policy for entrepreneurs.State is now 7th among states in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business rankings"

Nijalingappa Sugar Institute here to take stock of various issues confronting the sugar industry in the country, stressed that the sugar mills export the allotted sugar quota not only to avail of the incentive but also to stabilise the market price of sugar. The Union government was looking forward to sugar mills exporting surplus sugar and had offered Rs. 45 per tonne of sugarcane crushed by a sugar mill. It also fixed a quota for exports for individual sugar mills, which, on an average, was around 10 per cent of sugar produced by a mill.As of now, around four million tonnes of sugar was manufactured in excess during 2014-15, which could be exported. Though some of the mills have started exporting and taking advantages, many in the cooperative sector are still hesitant, Amit Kore, vice-president, National Federation of Cooperative Factories, said.Cane reduction fearedThe federation expressed apprehensions over the substantial reduction in sugarcane production and decrease in sugar recovery for the crushing year 2015-16 due to the prevailing drought conditions in the State. During 2014-15, 450 lakh tonnes of sugarcane was crushed with an average sugar recovery of 11 per cent in the State.However, during 2015-16, owing to water stress coupled with power shortage, sugarcane productivity had decreased leading to poor sugarcane availability for the factories to crush.The situation has also affected the process of sugar recovery as sugar factories were now crushing near dry and immature sugarcane.S. Nijalingappa Sugar Institute director R.B. Khandagave told The Hindu here that sugarcane production in the state might fall to 375 lakh tonnes.The situation might deteriorate during 2016-17 because sugarcane plantation was minimal and farmers were likely to remove ratoon sugarcane which would directly affect area under sugarcane.Seeing the existing scenario, there may be a reduction of sugarcane availability by 30 per cent in the ensuing season, he observed.Dr. Khandagave suggested that the sugar factories, instead of concentrating merely on expanding their crushing capacity, should undertake sugarcane development activities in their respective areas with an emphasis on soil and water conservation for the sustained development of sugar and allied industries.The meeting was chaired by Basavaraj Balekundri, president of the Federation of Karnataka Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd."

These included a Rs. 250 crore King Rudra Sugar Factory and a Rs. 80 crore project of the expansion of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) storage facility in Nandur-Kesaratigi Industrial Area on the outskirts of the city.The King Rudra Sugar Factory proposals were pending for the past few years and the entrepreneurs who mooted the proposal had finally signed the MoU with the government at the meet, saving the blushes of the officials in the Industries Department who abjectly failed to project the facilities available and the high incentives offered by the government for establishing industries in the district. Although almost all the heads of leading industrial houses participated in the meet, none showed interest in investing money in Kalaburagi despite the availability of land, water and electricity. A major drawback that kept industrialists away was the lack of an airport. Incidentally, Kalaburagi is the only divisional headquarters which does not have an airport.IOCL proposes to add one more storage tank for fuel and laying a 3.2-km railway line to the storage point to enable easy dumping of the fuel transported from different parts of the country.The State government also did not showcase the proposed National Investment and Manufacturing Zone (NIMZ) at Chitapur, Kalaburagi at the meet since it is yet to get final clearance from the union government. The NIMZ offering high incentives like five-year tax holiday, and other benefits would have been a perfect ground for investors to tap the potential of the city.No big player signed memorandums of understanding to set up industrial units in the district"

For that, economic growth is vital and job-intensive sectors need a fillip. This could range from apparel to horticulture.If public money is spent judiciously and creates infrastructure, theres no harm done even if we move beyond the fiscal deficit target. We need to move faster for the sake of those jobs. At the same time, revenue expenditure can be rationalised and I hope recommendations of the Expenditure Management Commission for more effective spending are incorporated in some form.The governments focus on ease of doing business is welcome and a lot has been done to improve business environment. This in turn will create jobs. There are of course bad sheep in every system but dont let one black sheep vitiate the system for everyone else. How to get that balance right is the key and the governments use of IT and digital technologies can help simplify the procedures while catching the black sheep.There is a need to get policy initiatives implemented at the state level not just because investments happen in the states but especially for agriculture. Fifty per cent of our people are dependent on the rural and farming sector. We need to ensure that our farmers feel confident that if they till their fields of two or five acres, they can earn adequate income on a sustainable basis. That is currently not happening. The crop insurance scheme announced recently by the Prime Minister is a good measure and should be rolled out extensively.Take the sugar industry. Because there is a direct organised linkage between farmers and industry, they are much better off and dont depend on the vagaries of the market. Its a separate issue that states use their own price that can be illogically high. The C. Rangarajan Committee had suggested a sensible approach to balance out everyones interests. Farmers may have delayed payments but they are still planting as they get a good return. We must have more agri-produce with processing linkages so that output gets purchased at a pre-determined price.FDI in multi-brand retail (MBR) would actually help rural India from two perspectives. One, we will get access to world-class technology and business practices for the entire supply chain. More importantly, today, the farmer gets 15 to 25 per cent of the retail final price. With FDI in MBR, you reduce the number of middlemen; the farmer should get between 30 to 40 per cent of the final price. So that could double his income. Farmers are intelligent, dont undermine their competence. Give them the money, they know which is the best product for their soil. Getting electricity and roads to villages are also critical for them to be able to move out their produce. Today, using a diesel genset is more expensive than paying the state Rs. 2-Rs.3 a unit.Subsidies are important for agriculture and it is time for a two-year plan to roll out direct benefit transfer (DBT) for all fertiliser subsidies for effective spending.Rural India and agriculture is critical for India. More minimum support price for producers should be considered. We have excess production of rice and wheat such that stocks are rotting in FCI godowns. And we are importing pulses. Now, theres talk of cartelization in Canada and Australia to jack up prices. When India goes to the world market, it buys lakhs of tonnes, so the world inflates prices. Why dont we pay the same thing to our farmer? The government had talked of farmer producer organizations. Its a good idea to bring farmers together so they get better negotiating power with input providers as well as buyers. The APMC Act and others have to be abolished. Some states are not acting on this. The roll out of the e-platform for the national agriculture market should be done quickly. Otherwise mandis will continue to charge 15 per cent of the revenue. Digital technology is helping farmers find better prices but because of these mandi rules and poor infrastructure, they cant move their produce around. The Centre has to push harder to get states to deliver.The author is Chairman, DCM Shriram Ltd."

Passers by admitted him to the nearby Dharapuram Government Hospital. He was later referred to the KMCH hospital for further treatment.Ramesh, a resident of Kilangundal village near Mulanur in Dharapuram Taluk, was declared brain dead on Tuesday morning. His father Ramalingam, who had learnt about organ donation from newspapers, agreed to donate Rameshs organs.A team of doctors from KMCH and the Coimbatore Government Hospital completed the formalities, and on Wednesday, Rameshs heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, corneas and skin were donated.While liver and one kidney were transplanted to patients registered in KMCH, the heart was sent to Fortis Malar and the pancreas to Apollo Hospital in Chennai. Another kidney, the corneas and skin were sent to other private hospitals in Coimbatore.On Wednesday, the traffic police created two green corridors to enable Fortis Malar and Apollo Hospital to receive the organs for transplant. We received a call on Tuesday night and reached Coimbatore around 8.40 p.m. We wanted both the heart and the lungs but unfortunately the lungs were not in good condition. The heart was harvested this morning and it reached the hospital around 10.30 a.m., said K.G. Suresh Rao, head of Cardiac Anaesthesia at Fortis Malar Hospital.Within an hour, the organ was transplanted in a 14-year-old Russian boy. He had suffered a stroke last month as his heart was weak and blood clots had travelled to his brain. It made him a candidate for transplant, said K.R. Balakrishnan, a cardiothoracic surgeon who did the surgery. The boy is recovering in the ICU. The second green corridor was created to transport the pancreas which arrived by a Jet Airways flight around 1.58 p.m. A 33-year-old recipient at the hospital, who was suffering from type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, was transplanted with the organ. Surgeon Anil Vaidya, who led the team, said the patient had been suffering from diabetes since the age of 12. Diabetes affects a lot of organs, the heart, the blood vessels eyes and kidneys. This chap had lost all the warning signals of low sugar, Dr. Vaidya said.A routine visit to the clinic proved lucky for the patient. Dr. Vaidya said the patients blood sugar did not normalise even after a cup of tea, indicating that it was a severe attack of very low sugar. Mostly world over, pancreatic transplants are done in conjunction with kidney. We usually take the patient for dialysis. But this patient did not need a kidney. This is the first time in India we did a lone pancreas transplant. He is now cured of diabetes and does not require insulin, Dr. Vaidya said.The organ left Coimbatore airport at noon and reached Apollo Hospital at 1.58 p.m. The surgery took about five hours. Dr. Vaidya said the pancreas was functioning normally in the transplanted patient."

Due to the lay-off, 306 families have lost their livelihood. Recalling the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Raos promise on multiple forums to take over the factory, and subsequent constitution of a committee to make suggestions to run the factory in cooperative mode, the Left parties accused the government of lay-off even before the report saw the light of the day. Sugarcane farmers from the surrounding villages are selling their produce in Maharashtra, the press release said, and demanded that they should be given an assurance of local purchase."

We confirmed the same with Sameer when we brought him for questioning last week. Neither of them was able to provide satisfactory explanations as to how the funds required for the purchase of the mill were raised, said another officer.The agency has alleged that the illegal gratification and bribe money collected by the Bhujbal family in kickbacks during the senior NCP leaders tenure as Public Works Department Minister was used in the form of share application money by two companies, Parvesh Constructions Private Ltd and Armstrong Energy Private Ltd.The funds were subsequently laundered and channelled to Armstrong Infrastructure and thereafter invested in the Girna Sugar Mill, said sources.The sugar mill, which had been shut since 1995, was acquired by Armstrong Infrastructure through auction proceedings from the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) for over Rs.27.82 crore in 2013. Farmers and activists in the area had at the time alleged that the mill was undervalued before being sold to the Bhujbals.Apart from a bank loan of Rs.10 crore, the remaining amount was paid allegedly using funds received from Armstrong Energy Private Ltd and Parvesh Construction Private Ltd.This rendered Girna Sugar Mill a tainted asset. Therefore, the property has been attached, pending confirmation from the adjudicating authority, the official said."

This is the reason the company has directed more employees to go on mandatory leave.C.S. Shivamurthy, president of the employees association, told reporters that since February 28, around 600 workers, barring the ones working on water supply, township management and the safety wing, have been asked to go on earned leave.

Srinivasulu Reddy.Mr. Srinivasulu Reddy, who raised the issue under Rule 311, said that he had first-hand account of frustration and despair among the youths when he toured eight districts under  Nirudyoga Poru Bata.While over 8.6 lakh had registered themselves in the employment exchange by 2015, only 22, 510 were called for job interviews and 260 selected. In university placement centres and other professional institutions, 48,000 people registered themselves.After the TDP government assumed power, interviews were conducted for 10,335 DSC posts. People hoped that jobs would be generated if Mr. Chandrababu Naidu comes back to power.Adding to the problem, about one lakh people lost their jobs as scores of small and medium units were closed down, including jute mills, ferroalloys units, pharma, and cooperative sugar factories.IT units, SEZs like Sri City, which were given lands on the assurance of providing jobs to local youths, failed to keep their commitment, he said.Promised steel plant at Kadapa, ancillary units for Visakhapatnam Steel Plant too did not materialise, he said.Labour and Employment Minister K. Atchannaidu, however, clarified that notification would be issued to 20,000-25,000 teacher and police department posts, and priority was being given for skill development for lakhs of engineering, polytechnic, and ITI candidates to make them employable.About 90,000 youths were trained and 20,000 of them got jobs. Siemens was setting up six Centres of Excellence and clusters for skill development with Rs.4,000 crore.District employment exchanges were transformed into career guidance centres. They would help match requirement of industries and candidates with suitable skills.Admitting unemployment was a concern, Mr. Atchannaidu said without industrialisation, jobs could not be generated on a large scale and the government was doing its best to attract investments.Of the Rs.4.75 lakh crore MoUs signed at the Visakhapatnam Partnership Summit, at least 10-20 per cent was expected to materialise. He appealed to the Left parties not to turn away every industry so long as pollution control measures were in place to generate jobs and economic activity.The government, as recommended by the Cabinet Sub-Committee, would extend power subsidy and reopen 35 ferroalloys units in April. Aware of their aspirations, the government enhanced the budgetary allocation for youths from Rs.30 crore to Rs.830 crore to equip them for jobs, self-employment, and turn entrepreneurs, he said.35 ferroalloys units to be reopened in April, says Atchannaidu"

Ultrasound pointed at a case of fatty liver, and tests showed fluctuating sugar levels. He had vomited frequently since the age of eight, with increasing muscle weakness.Dr. Pachat suspected it to be a case of MADD (Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehyrogenase Deficiency), a rare genetic disorder that occurred only in one in two lakh persons. It caused an enzyme defect that would not break down fats and proteins. This caused deficiency of riboflavin, the yellow vitamin of the B-complex group required for producing energy.A few more tests confirmed the doctors suspicion. A diet low in fat with oral supplement of high doses of riboflavin improved his condition in a month. Once the disease was identified in this man, it helped in early intervention for his sister, who too was showing similar symptoms, she said."
