But they do reflect the unpredictably of the candidate.Trumps entire reputation is sort of built upon this idea of a candidate taking up unpopular positions, said Ms. Gorzelany-Mostak.Marco Rubios beats reflect a young Latino man who grew up in Miami more than they do a conservative Republican, with Flo Rida, the Black Eyed Peas and Calvin Harris all on regular rotation. Lately, Mr. Rubio bounces out onto stage to AC/DCs Thunderstruck and leaves to Greater , by Christian pop group Mercy Me.Mr. Rubio has spoken to CNN about his love for EDM, denying he had ever been to a rave but saying he grew up listening to 90s west coast hip hop, and now enjoys dance music. But he was careful to note that his favourites were country songs laid over electronic music  meaning the lyrics were clean. The country music is also a nod to the people he is campaigning in front of, said Sabrina Siddiqui, a journalist who has trailed the senators campaign.Conservative tonesTed Cruz, the hard-line evangelical candidate from Texas, plays country and Christian pop, including Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly by Aaron Tippin and tunes from the Christian band Newsboys. But his music doesnt garner much attention, since his few tracks often repeat, and they clearly meld with his image as a conservative and deeply religious southerner.Bernie Sanders music, like his politics, revolves around revolution: Power to the People by John Lennon, Talkin Bout a Revolution by Tracy Chapman, The Revolution Starts Now by Steve Earle.But ever since David Bowies death in January, Mr. Sanders has left the stage to the strains of Bowies Starman : Theres a starman waiting in the sky / Hed like to come and meet us / But he thinks hed blow our minds.Its a strategic pick. Bowie: hes a rebel, a revolutionary, a radical, all wrapped in one charismatic man, Ms. GorzelanyMostak said, asking Can Sanders channel some of that star magic?Ms. Clintons crowd is mainly middle-aged women, and not exactly the typical audience for a pop-star playlist of top 20 hits circa 2016, a list exemplified by Ms. Clintons carefully curated Spotify playlist, which clearly targets younger people.

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMHave you been finding summer this year to be more sweltering than the last few years?The weather observatory at the Central Sericultural Research and Training Institute (CSR&TI) near here has recorded 37.1 degrees Celsius on March 22 , which is the highest in the last four years.The temperatures this March began with 33 degrees Celsius and climbed to 36 degrees Celsius on March 11 before touching a high of 37.1 degrees Celsius on March 22.However, it has begun to dip marginally since then and reached 36 degrees Celsius on Saturday.Speaking to The Hindu , CSR&TI scientist Rajashekar K. said that the highest temperature recorded during the last 11 years was 38 degrees Celsius in May, 2006.Though the observatory at CSR&TI was not in a position to forecast weather, Dr. Rajashekar said that summer had set in early this year while the number of winter days had been cut short.Weather experts pointed out that summer, which normally starts in March, had set in during February this year.Meanwhile, Narendra Babu, research assistant at Weather Monitoring Centre at Organic Farm Research Centre of University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) at Naganahalli on the outskirts of the city, said that the average mean temperature in March had been 33.8 degrees Celsius during the last 40 years.Though this years average temperature in March will be tabulated only after the end of this month, we expect the average temperature to be between 1 to 2 degrees more than the 33.8 degrees Celsius, he said.The public should be wary of gastroenteritis as well as dehydration during the hot summer days.Doctors have reported an increase in incidence of gastroenteritis during the last few days.Several patients are walking into the hospital complaining of abdominal pain and loose stools with instances of food poisoning on the rise, said Satisha, physician of Vikram Hospital.In most cases, the patients would have eaten unhygienic food from the roadside or infected food in hotels. The hot temperature is favourable for activation of bacteria and virus, said Dr. Satisha cautioning people against consuming unhygienically prepared pani puri and other food items by the roadside. Even food prepared at homes could be spoilt if kept for long hours, he warned.Similiarly, Smitha N. Kotian, consultant at Apollo BGS Hospital in Mysuru, warned people against eating cut-fruits served by the roadside, which is also an open invitation to gastroenteritis.Dr. Satisha cited a rise in the number of people, particularly the elderly, complaining about thirst, weakness, fatigue, sweating and intolerable heat.People should drink plenty of water to prevent themselves from dehydrated during the hot days. Drinking two to three litres of water every day is recommended. In summer, people should drink at least three litres of water to remain hydrated and prevent the loss of electrolytes from the body through sweating, he said.While milder cases of dehydration can be treated with oral rehydration salt (ORS) available in sachets or prepared at home with water, salt, sugar and lemon, Dr. Satisha said extreme cases should be referred to the doctors or hospitals. Dr. Satisha advocated consumption of coconut as well.Dr. Kotian also advised wearing of cotton and light coloured clothes. Prevent direct exposure to sun. If exposure is necessary, cover yourself with an umbrella or shades to prevent heat stroke, she said.Protect your eyes in the summerSpecial CorrespondentWith the sun emitting rays of different wavelengths, including the most damaging ultraviolet rays, opthalmologists have suggested people to protect their eyes by wearing sunglasses with ultraviolet (UV) protection.The best way to protect your eyes is with sunglasses with 100 per cent UV protection. Polarised glasses may be more comfortable to people working outdoors as they block glare, said Pallavi Prabhu, consultant ophthalmologist, Sushrutha Eye Hospital, Mysuru.Dr. Prabhu also suggested wearing sun hats wit h a wide brim to decrease UV exposure.Dr. Prabhu also warned people against communicable disease like viral conjunctivitis, which breaks out during summer.During summer, communicable disease such as viral conjunctivitis is on the rise. Hence, washing of hand helps in reducing the load of virus, she said.Allergic conjunctivitis is also a common condition, which needs a lot of protective measures like avoiding the rubbing of the eye and using protective goggles.Dr. Prabhu also pointed out that the eyes are stressed due to heat and exposure to sun throughout the day. Hence, she suggested cold compress of the eye. Slices of cucumber can be used over the eyes to avoid puffiness, she said."

A file photo of a restaurant serving French food in Puducherry.The time of the year to wish Bon Apptit has arrived. Get ready to savour the taste of France in Puducherry.On March 21, the restaurants across the world will serve special menu of recipes inspired by French expertise. At least 1,500 chefs, 1,500 menus, 150 embassies in five continents will serve one dinner to celebrate French cuisine worldwide as part of the Good France project.On Monday, four restaurants including Le Boulevard, Mango Hill, Satsanga and La Villa will serve the special French cuisine in Puducherry. Five restaurants in Chennai and one in Thiruvananthapuram will participate in the Got de France (Good France). This is an initiative of celebrated chef Alain Ducasse and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development to showcase French way of life, regional products, and promote France as a tourist destination. Joining the celebrations, French Embassies will also host Good France dinners on Monday.Laurent Fabius, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France), views this event that unites chefs from all horizons and around the world on the same evening, with one shared goal of celebrating the excellence and creativity of French gastronomy.In this second edition of Good France, regional prefects like Reunion Island have been asked to take part in the event. This is an initiative to promote French chefs working in our regions to showcase regional culinary traditions.UNESCO in 2010 incorporated the gastronomic meal of the French into the intangible cultural heritage and humanity. The event recreates the Epicurean Dinners initiative in 1912 (the same menu, on the same day, in several world cities, for as many guests as possible) launched by Auguste Escoffier.The participants are expected to design the menu based on the following sequence: aperitif and canaps, starter, main course, cheese, dessert, French wines and champagnes.In this event, each recipe will be based on cuisine that uses less fat, sugar and salt and shows concern for good food and environment. The price will be fixed at the restaurants discretion and each participant will commit to donating 5 per cent of the proceeds to a local NGO promoting health and environment.This year, the number of restaurants in India participating in the event has doubled to 50.French consulate too hosted a dinner prior to this event on Friday night. To everyones surprise French Consul General Philippe Janvier-Kamiyama hosted a dinner with a complete vegetarian menu. This is to show that French cuisine is not only for non-vegetarians but there are many varieties for the vegetarians too, he said.The menu on Friday night included iced cucumber soup with green apple and coriander, zucchini mille feuiffes, broccoli gratin, stuffed peppers with rice and spices, cheese platter, green salad, strawberry sorbet and caramelized pears and coffee."

Heated arguments were witnessed yet again between the security personnel and Ms. Roja. She insisted that the Chief Marshal produce the written instructions, if any, to prevent her from entering the House, but the official maintained that he was following the instructions from the higher ups.Enraged over this, Ms. Roja staged a dharna in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue on the pavement outside the Assembly premises. The YSRC legislator developed signs of illness as she staged her protest amid sweltering heat conditions.As her blood and sugar levels dropped, she was moved to the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences in an ambulance.

He was delivering a lecture on Education for Development organised by the T.A. Pai Management Institute (TAPMI), here.Mr. Gadkari said that there was no dearth of resources in the country, but there was a lack of vision. More than technology and research, a vision is essential. A leadership with vision could create miracles, he said. Conversion of knowledge into wealth involves everyone. The people in the country are competent. But they should get the opportunity. More research and technological competence is required to reduce the cost and improve quality, he said.Emphasising on reducing pollution, Mr. Gadkari said that there was a huge potential for bio-diesel and bio-CNG. If methane from waste water is converted into bio-CNG, it would be possible to run at least 50,000 buses. The plan of my ministry is to run 100 buses on bio-CNG. It will be cost effective, he said.Stating that the sugar industry in the country was facing problems, he said that at present ethanol was being made from molasses from sugar factories. We are adding five per cent ethanol in petrol. We are soon going to run 50 buses entirely on ethanol in Nagpur (Maharashtra). It will be possible to run cars and trucks on ethanol. Ethanol is a bio-fuel which will also help farmers in rural areas, he said.Mr. Gadkari said his ministry would start road works worth Rs. 2,00,000 crore before May 26 and would take up works worth Rs. 3,00,000 crore next year. The Minister said that his ministry has taken a decision to increase the length of National Highways from the existing 96,000 km to 2 lakh km. Already, 1.55 lakh km of road had been declared as NHs, he said.His ministry was giving importance to developing inland waterways in 111 rivers across the country because it was cost effective compared to other modes of transport, Mr. Gadkari said."
58f95e1ba3d24b0b70c3f318,How water inequality governs drought hit Maharashtra,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/How-water-inequality-governs-drought-hit-Maharashtra/article14377369.ece,2016-06-01,"Almost a dry water body of the Nandur Madhameshwar dam, around 30 km from Nasik, which supplies drinking water to Jayakwadi dam and Marathwada, portrays a grim picture of the water situation in Maharashtra. File Photo: Ajaj ShaikhA resident of Pune, Maharashtras second-most developed city, uses five times as much water as her counterpart in Latur, the district most ravaged by drought in the south-central Marathwada region.Thats the extent of water inequality in Maharashtra, Indias most developed State, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of Statewide water use, characterised by disproportionate availability and consumption of water across regions, crops and consumers.The coastal region of Konkan - occupying a tenth of the States landmass and home to 14 per cent of its population (except Mumbai) - contains more than half of Maharashtras water, according to government data.The populous, dry and rain-shadow regions of western, central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, retain the other half, clashing with each other and neighbouring States for water.But the natural imbalance of water does not make drought inevitable. That happens because water has been deliberately routed to areas where it is already plentiful and to farmers who are politically powerful.Sugarcane - which is grown on four per cent of the States farms - consumes 70 per cent of water available for irrigation, IndiaSpend reported earlier, although no more than 1.1 million farmers grow the lucrative cash crop. In contrast, about 10 million jowar (sorghum), pulses and oilseeds farmers get no more than 10 per cent of irrigation water.The earlier Congress-Nationalist Congress Party-led government was entrenched in sugar politics with 13 of the 30 cabinet ministers owning or controlling sugar factories, Parineeta Dandekar, associate coordinator of South Asian Network for Dams, Rivers and People, wrote in her analysis of the sugarcane situation in Maharashtra.A natural phenomenonThere are five river basins in Maharashtra: Krishna, Godavari, Tapi, Narmada and a combined basin of westward flowing rivers in the coastal Konkan region.Of these, three are agriculturally important - Krishna, Godavari and Tapi. They cover 89 per cent of the States area; 0.4 per cent of the State falls under the Narmada river basin.The Konkan basin drains 10.9 per cent of the land, while containing 55 per cent of the States water.The Krishna basin drains most parts of Western Maharashtra, the prosperous districts of Kolhapur, Pune, Satara, Sangli and Solapur and some perennially droughtplagued areas, such as the eastern swathes of Sangli, Satara and Solapur districts.The Godavari basin covers the drought-hit regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha.Of the 125 billion cubic metres (BCM) surface water available in Maharashtras river basins, most of the 69 BCM in the Konkan region goes unutilised, according to a 2012 Maharashtra government White Paper on Irrigation.In contrast, the 17 BCM in the Krishna and 34 BCM in the Godavari basins are insufficient for the regions they water.In Maharashtra, sugarcane cultivation, which is on less than four per cent of the total cropped area of the State, takes away almost 70 per cent of irrigation water in the State, leading to massive inequity in the use of water within the State, said the sugarcane price policy report, 2014-15, issued by the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).The CACP tabulates the share of irrigation water used by major crops in Maharashtra.How sugarcane corners irrigation waterSugarcane is the only crop in Maharashtra which is wholly irrigated. Irrigation water is available for no more than nine percent of pulses and four per cent of oilseeds.About 10 million farmers grow jowar, pulses and oilseeds  no more than a tenth of these farms are irrigated, as we saidand these crops use about 2.2 million litres of water per hectare, about 2,000 MCM of water through the year.Sugarcanes 1.1 million farmers use 18.7 million litres per hectare and consume 18,000 MCM  nine times that of jowar, oilseeds and pulses  annually across the state.Urban water consumption patterns are heavily tilted towards developed cities.The city of Latur in Marathwada consumes 60 litres per person daily, while an average Mumbaikar uses around 260 litres a day. The average daily use of water per person in Pune is 352 litres, according to IndiaSpend calculations, based on daily water requirements of these cities and the latest available population figures.A village with less than 20,000 people should get 40 litres of water per person per day, five litres less than the water prescribed to flush a toilet in a city such as Mumbai  these are the standards set in 1993 by the Bureau of Indian Standards in its Code of Basic Requirements.The standards also recommend reduced water supply to poorer localities in urban areas.In 2015, the Kelkar Committee on balanced regional development in Maharashtra recommended 140 litres per capita per day across rural and urban Maharashtra.The recommendation has not yet been included in the States water policy. - IANS"
58f95f45a3d24b0b70c3f3a2,30 per cent dip in sugarcane production in State this year,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/30-per-cent-dip-in-sugarcane-production-in-State-this-year/article16159641.ece,2016-11-07,"After touching a high two years ago, the State is now facing a drastic decline in sugarcane production owing to drought as well as lukewarm response of farmers in the wake of the factories delaying payment of dues.This has not only put the sugar mills in a spot, but is also bound to reduce production. While 450 lakh tonnes of sugarcane was available for crushing for the 65 sugar mills in the State in 2014-15, the availability reduced to 376.65 lakh tonnes in 2015-16.Accordingly, sugar production reduced from 49.8 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 to 40.45 lakh tonnes in 2015-16.However, production is estimated to have reduced by 30 per cent this year owing to shrinking sowing area as well as the drought gripping the State.The States normal sowing area accounts for 4.52 lakh hectare to 5 lakh ha with an average cane yield of around 80 to 100 tonnes per ha. However, this year, cane availability is estimated to be on 3.5 lakh ha. Also, the yield could decline to just 75 to 80 tonnes per ha. The crushing duration could also be reduced from the normal period of 150 days a year to just 70 to 80 days, according to R.B. Khandagave, director, S. Nijalingappa Sugar Institute.According to him, many traditional sugarcane farmers have switched to other crops.Farmers plightThere are doubts whether farmers would get better prices owing to the decrease in sugarcane yield. This is because the poor quality of produce this year might mean lesser prices since it is linked to the sugar recovery rate (percentage of sugar production from a tonne of sugarcane)As National Farmers Organisation president B.P.

Amudha Lakshmi, principal, Chettinad Vidyashram School. However, she added: we have no control on what the students purchase from the shops around the campus. But, we are sensitising them to the dangers of consuming junk food, said S. Amudha Lakshmi, principal, Chettinad Vidyashram School.Lakshmi Srinivasan, principal of P.S.

The early results of an ongoing study seem to indicate this may be the case, said researchers.Of 209 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who were studied, 54.1 per cent were diabetic, and 21 per cent were pre-diabetic. Of these, newly-diagnosed patients with diabetes  32.7 per cent -- had low HbA1C levels, indicating that they may have been pre-diabetic earlier and their tuberculosis infection probably pushed this into full-blown diabetes, said Vijay Viswanathan, head, M.V. Hospital for Diabetes, Royapuram, and one of the co-principal investigators of the study.The Effects of Diabetes on Tuberculosis Severity (EDOTS) study, was begun in early 2014, and is a collaboration between the University of Massachusetts Medical School and the Prof. M. Viswanathan Diabetes Research Centre. The National Institute of Research in Tuberculosis is involved in the immunology portion of the study.The early results of this study have surprised researchers. Previous reports had indicated a diabetes prevalence of about 25 per cent in TB patients and about 10-22 per cent in the general population in and around Chennai. So, the steep increase in prevalence is both surprising and a major cause for concern, said S. Subash Babu, scientific director, National Institutes of Health -National Institute of Research in Tuberculosis-International Center for Excellence in Research.The data, said Hardy Kornfeld, professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, suggest that becoming sick with TB can push people from pre-diabetes into a diabetic range of high blood sugar.However, Prof. Kornfeld, also a co-principal investigator of the study, pointed out that these were only interim results and that the study was ongoing.An important question that we hope to answer in the future is whether patients who progress from pre-diabetes to diabetes as a result of TB will revert to pre-diabetes or normal blood sugar after TB treatment or if some of them will be left persistently diabetic, he said, in an email.We know that diabetic patients are vulnerable to tuberculosis. This study was initiated to determine if, when a patient who had TB and was on treatment contracted diabetes, would this be a problem in his cure? said Dr. Viswanathan. He explained that an earlier study had shown that treatment failure rates of tuberculosis patients were higher if they had poorly-controlled diabetes.Chennai is estimated to have a diabetes prevalence of 18.5 per cent, Dr. Viswanathan said.If patients with pre-diabetes are becoming diabetic due to TB, and, as is known, diabetes increases the severity of TB, more public health efforts may need to be focused in this direction, the researchers say. The TB control programme now needs to concern itself with screening for diabetes in all its patients and instituting appropriate diabetic treatment to ensure good TB control. said Dr. Babu.And diabetes too: I would say that our current findings provide another justification to focus limited public health resources on diabetes prevention, said Prof. Kornfeld."

While almost all the laboratories of the 29 hospitals are not adequately equipped, the existing equipment in some are not in working condition, depriving patients of the facilities.For instance, in Victoria Hospital, Bengaluru; Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences, Chitradurga District Hospital, and general hospitals in Bailhongal and Nanjangud, it was found that there is no timely supply of reagents, affecting the use of analysers.Similarly, the flow cytometer electro process and PT-APTT machines (used to detect cancer) in the pathology laboratory of K.R.

E. Theranirajan, head, Paediatrics, Government Vellore Medical College Hospital (GVMCH), said the common diseases that occur during summer are typhoid, hepatitis A and chickenpox. Throat infection and prickly heat can also cause trouble.Drinking contaminated water can cause typhoid and hepatitis A. It is important to avoid drinking water outside. Give purified water to children. Dehydration is a problem during summer. Children should take plenty of fluids, like home-made buttermilk and fruit juice, Mr. Theranirajan said.Tender coconut can also be given for children, while ice creams can be avoided, he said.Parents can give bath twice a day for children, he added. With chicken pox also being common during summer, he said vaccination was available for children aged between 15 months and five years, in two doses.Accidental ingestion of kerosene was another problem. He advised parents to keep kerosene out of the reach of children.Go. Bharani, retired professor of medicine, GVMCH, said people should avoid going out in the sun from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. It is better to finish important work early as the sun is at the peak during these hours. Drink butter milk, lemon juice and tender coconut and wear cotton clothes to manage the heat, she said.Diabetics, too, should take utmost care. They should keep the sugar level under control. They can drink buttermilk and lemon juice with salt, consume vegetable salad, tomato and greens soup, she added.Carbohydrates intakeIt is important to reduce intake of carbohydrates and oily food during summer, and increase vegetables and greens in ones diet.

After three years, I understand from the Calicut Corporation office that my payment of house tax has not been informed by the FRIENDS to the Corporation office and the civic body authorities demanded that I show them the original of the receipts and give them a photocopy. I believe that the FRIENDS centre was opened with a view to helping the public avoid a long wait at the Corporation and other government offices. Now, the situation is such that we have to spend double the energy and time to convince the authorities that we have paid our taxes on time.I wonder whether this is happening to other citizens as well. The FRIENDS centre is redundant; it is of no use to the commoner and is a burden on the exchequer.K.V. SahasranamKozhikodeUnscientificpedestrian crossingIn Kozhikode, there is a pedestrian crossing that is unscientifically marked in violation of safety norms. The crossing is in front of the BEM Higher Secondary School at Maananchira. The crossing is marked in the middle of a curve. Therefore, pedestrians and vehicle drivers cannot see each other from a safe distance.To add to the woes, it is in the middle of bus bays where the buses halt randomly. Traffic from two roads converging in a one-way pattern makes it an accident-prone spot in the city. This can be solved if the pedestrian marking is shifted to CSI Hall where there is ample visibility, the road is straight, and vehicles from two directions do not converge at this point. Will the authorities concerned take note of this?J.J. VellaraKozhikodeA plea to DMOConcerted efforts are needed to regulate the functioning of clinical laboratories in Kozhikode. My blood samples and my wifes were tested at a mobile laboratory at a medical camp organised by our residents association. The results showed alarmingly high fasting blood sugar level.Suspecting that the values could be wrong, we approached another laboratory and got our samples tested. The results showed that our fasting blood sugar was within normal limits.Now, can treatment be started going by the erroneous reading from such laboratories?Wrong readings are either owing to incompetence of the laboratory technicians or the sub-standard reagents used in the tests.I, therefore, request the District Medical Officer (DMO) to enforce a strict vigil on the functioning of the private clinical laboratories.C.

The study was undertaken on the basis of reports on the positive effect of unripe jackfruit for diabetes and it was carried out under an initiative funded by the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation to commercially exploit freeze-dried unripe jackfruit.Some of the patients who used unripe jackfruit daily were able to reverse the situation to pre-diabetes condition, said James Joseph, an entrepreneur promoting the use of freeze-dried raw jackfruit.The patients who used up to 30 grams of freeze dried unripe jackfruit daily were able to eliminate wheat and rice from their daily diet and also overcome weight gain problems.According to the study, 30 grams of dehydrated unripe jackfruit replaced a cup of cooked rice or two wheat chapatis and also offered much higher level of being satiated or the feeling of being full, eliminating the need for snacks. The study showed that glycemic load (glucose level) in unripe jackfruit is almost half that of rice or wheat. This is the reason why unripe jackfruit helps reverse the diabetic condition.Sydney Universitys Glycemic Index Research Service is considered one of the best in the world for Glycemic Index (GI) studies recommended by the Glycemic Index Foundation.The Centre has tested sugar value of more than 3,500 foods. The study on unripe jackfruit was conducted between January and February 2016 as per the internationally recognised GI methodology approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of University of Sydney."

The ED has further contended in its case that the money received in complaints was routed through companies owned by the family and invested in a real estate venture in Navi Mumbai, which never took off.The ED arrested Sameer on February 2 this year and the senior Mr Bhujbal on March 14. Both are in judicial custody.According to ED officials, the charge sheet, which is over 11,000 pages, was filed in a special PMLA court on Wednesday and contains details about the transactions between various companies involved, the money trail, and statements from numerous witnesses connected to the case.Apart from the Bhujbals, the ED has also named corporations such as DB Realty, Balwa Group, Neelkamal Realtors & Builders Pvt. Ltd., Neelkamal Central Apartment LLP, and Kakade Infrastructure, as well as individuals like Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, and Sanjay Kakade. The firms mentioned in the charge sheet had bid for the contract during Mr Bhujbals tenure as Public Works Department minister, and he allegedly received kickbacks from them.Assets worth Rs 131.86 crore have been provisionally attached, an ED official told The Hindu . The attached assets include flats, a bungalow, fixed deposits, land, a building, and a sugar factory.The ED, in its charge sheet, has contended that the money received by the Bhujbals was routed to Kolkata and back, after which it was invested in commercial properties in Maharashtra, including a 25-acre plot in the Rohinjan village in Navi Mumbai, which was bought by Devisha Infrastructure, owned jointly by Pankaj and Sameer, in 2009. A multi-storey residential project called Hex World was announced on the piece of land, and Devisha Infrastructure accepted over Rs 44 crore from more than 2,300 people as payment for advance booking for flats in the proposed residential society. However, the project never took off, and the Navi Mumbai police, based on a recommendation by the Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau, subsequently registered an FIR against Pankaj, Sameer, and other officials of the company.The EDs investigation is based on a report submitted by the ACB, which was ordered by the Bombay High Court to constitute a Special Investigating Team to look into allegations made by a Public Interest Litigation filed against Mr Bhujbal. The ACB, too, registered a separate FIR in the matter and filed a charge sheet, indicting Chhagan for misusing his official position to award the contracts to a firm of his choice.The ED has recorded statements from several people, including independent parties who helped to launder the money before it was invested in Maharashtra. Officials confirmed that the money passed through three to four levels before being routed back to the state. Further inquiries into the money trail and the assets generated out of the proceeds of the crime are in progress. If required, supplementary charge sheets will be filed.""The investigation into the other case pertaining to the construction of the Central library in Kalina is still in progress,"" the official added."

Chandrasekhar Rao, Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, Tummala Nageswara Rao, T.

We welcome the suggestion that all parties should work together for long-term steps to make Telangana drought-free, he said. Agriculture Minister Srinivas Reddy got up to narrate a tale that he had never revealed all these years. When N. Chandrababu Naidu was the Chief Minister of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and I was Agriculture Minister, I told him to give up efforts to privatise the sugar factory and for its revival in the government sector only. But Mr. Naidu got irritated during a meeting and hit me on the thigh before walking out, he informed.Continuing, he said Mr. Naidu had a security personnel to summon him. He asked me if I was hurt in the thigh and I replied that the injury was in my heart, Mr. Reddy said in what looked to the Opposition an effort to dramatise the situation. Mr. Revanth Reddy said that someone who was insulted thus should have had the courage to resign from the Cabinet. When T.

Besides, Bangladesh imports from India iron and steel, sugar and cereals, glass and glassware, vehicles, equipment, aluminium, plastics, copper and utensils made of base metal.As of now, tyres and textile machineries are sent to Colombo/Singapore and then to Chittagong, while other commodities are moved through rail or road from different parts of the country.Due to increased volume, rail and road traffic is facing congestion on the Indo-Bangladesh border leading to payment of surcharge. Traders from both nations have been searching for an alternative source to save on time and additional cost.An Indian exporter said that moving commodities from Krishnapatnam to Chittagong or Pangaon Inland Container Terminal would cut the delivery time from 25-30 days to 7 days. The cost savings would be approximately $300 per container. It would go up to $1,000 per box with a pick up in the volume.After a gap of nearly four decades, India and Bangladesh have started a direct container feeder service.

The Bench said once the potability level of water was found, the court could consider giving a direction. Listing out water policy measures to a question, the AG said Maharashtra had a two-fold solution  long-term and short-term. The government had asked Marathwada farmers to use drip irrigation for sugar factories as it would reduce 50% of water consumption. The water policy was in place. The first priority was to use it for domestic, hygiene and sanitation purposes, and the second was agriculture."

Photo: By Special ArrangementA team from the Indian Institute of Science is developing a handheld medical device, which can measure eight biometric parameters related to blood and urine ( see info box ). It is expected to make testing costs very affordable and make monitoring of health statistics more convenient for patients, said the scientists.This and other developments in the field such as continuous glucose monitoring systems and insulin pumps are changing how doctors and patients are managing diabetes.A handheld device to test multiple parameters will definitely help patients as it will reduce the time to obtain results, said Rakesh Kumar, emergency physician at Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road.PathShodh Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., a R&D company incubated at IISc., has developed the device, which is in the prototype stage. The innovation lies in downscaling complicated testing equipment into a handheld device.Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Vinay Kumar, who developed the concept as part of his Ph.D. research, told The Hindu , The motivation behind the product is to transform science for a social mission.Compared to traditional techniques, which are based on optical spectroscopy, we have adopted an electro-chemical technology similar to what is used in glucometers (a device to measure blood sugar levels), said Navakanta Bhat, professor at IISc., Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, and another founding member of the company.Apart from glucose, parameters such as HbA1c, haemoglobin and serum albumin cannot be tested by patients at home. The team hopes to change this.The technology has not been exploited for other medical parameters owing to difficulties in implementation, Prof. Bhat added. We are trying to make testing very affordable, compared to what is currently available in hospitals, said Gautam Sharma, vice-president (Business) at PathShodh.The team expects that the product will become as common as glucometers are today. We are conducting trials to make sure the accuracy of tests is on par with laboratory tests, said Mr. Sharma.Rise in number of diabeticsAccording to theInternational DiabetesFederation, by 2040, one adult in 10 (642 million) will have diabetesThe federation estimates that India is home to more than 65.1 million people with the disease, compared to 50.8 million in 2010Rise in number of diabeticsAccording to the International Diabetes Federation, by 2040, one adult in 10 (642 million) will have diabetesThe federation estimates that India is home to more than 65.1 million people with the disease, compared to 50.8 million in 2010"

Stevia is called Meethi Tulsi and Meethi Patti by Indian farmers. Stevia leaves are processed by PureCircle to form a white powder substance, used as a sweetener.Indian farmers that grow PureCircle stevia on one hectare of land can expect to yield an income of about Rs.4 lakh a year.Early agricultural trials are already underway in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, the company said.The investment will help develop infrastructure for farming and stevia processing"

Our country presently has around 35 million in pre-diabetic stage, which is a 20 percent increase in five years. The figures can be more as lots of person yet remain untested, he said.LifestyleThe API, through its awareness programmes, planned to educate the people to come forward to test blood sugar levels and also to explain to them the lifestyle management procedures and diet which the pre-diabetics need to follow for not turning into diabetics.Dr. Muruganathan, who is also the national president of Hypertension Society of India, explained that people in pre-diabetes stage and having hypertension had 2.5 times more possibilities to turn into diabetics than the other persons.The API would be reaching out to the people even in the rural areas to include high fibre and low calorie foods in the daily diet.

I have already requested the concerned Ministers to release money to the factory to start this years crushing operations. I will also request Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to take all necessary measures to ensure that the factory buys sugarcane from farmers and produces sugar so that it brings it some revenue, Mr. Patil told presspersons in Bidar on Wednesday.Allegations deniedHe denied allegations of interference and harassment made by Sanjay Kheny, who resigned as factory chairman a few days ago. Neither I, nor my brother Bheem Rao, a fellow director, nor my supporters have interfered in Mr. Khenys administration. All charges of harassing him or any other board member or officer are false, he said.Counter chargeIn turn, Mr. Patil charged Mr. Kheny of irregularities. Mr Kheny has sold sugar for less than the market price, wasted crores of rupees on equipment maintenance and has spent Rs. 8-10 crore on unspecified issues. The board members have objected to all these issues in writing, Mr. Patil said. He said an inquiry into the affairs of the factory ordered by the Department of Cooperation, under Section 64 of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Act, 1959, was nearing completion and would expose who was responsible for the irregularities. He clarified that he had no intention of becoming the chairman of the factorys board.History of BSSKBSSK is the oldest sugar factory in the district. It was established in 1961 and started crushing in 1969. It was set up at a cost of Rs. 3 crore on 170 acres of land in Hallikhed-Bujurg village in Humnabad taluk. It has around 1,000 full-time and part-time employees and has the capacity to crush 3,500 tonnes of sugarcane per day.Poor managementHowever, owing to inefficient management issues and delay in payment of arrears to farmers, its debts have increased to around Rs. 210 crore. Its sugar yield rate percentage has been unstable, moving from 9.7 to 10.5. Successive managements have been accused of selling sugar at lesser than the market price and appointing unnecessary staff for political considerations. Its crushing capacity has also been uneven. It crushed 6.3 lakh tonnes in 2008 but could crush only 65,000 tonnes in 2015."

He said the necessary permission from the Railways had been obtained to carry water.He was replying to a question raised by Latur city MLA Amit Deshmukh. Around 50,000 villagers have migrated from Latur. The government must announce interest waiver to industries which had to be closed down due to water scarcity and steps must be taken to control the water tanker rates, said Mr. Deshmukh.Section 144 has been invoked in Latur to avoid riots over water as all sources have dried up. The city is allegedly getting water once in 20 days.The Revenue Minister, however, refuted the allegations of migration, and said the government is committed to supplying water to the people. Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil alleged that government officials were misleading the Minister by providing false information.Had the water in the Manjra dam been saved instead of being used for the Manjara sugar factory, Latur city would not have suffered to such an extreme level, said Mr. Khadse. He referred to former Chief Minister late Vilasrao Deshmukh for not being able to solve the water problem despite being the Minister for 21 years and CM for eight years.The Opposition accused the government of playing politics over drought. Mr. Deshmukh, who is the elder son of the deceased Minister, said the allegations against the Manjara sugar factory were completely baseless since it used water only after obtaining government permission.NCP leader Jayant Patil too objected to the Ministers reply, claiming it was an attempt to divert attention from the problem. The government was warned of the water scarcity. Instead of politicising the issue, the government should use at least 10 trains to supply water to Latur.Former CM Prithviraj Chavan said the government was delivering speech, not results.It is such a pity that the government is still blaming the previous governments, especially at a time when it has enough time to tackle the problem.Section 144 invoked in the city to avoid riots over water as all sources have dried up, says Minister"

I thought it was merely a little weakness that I experienced from time to time, he told the doctor who diagnosed his medical condition. The results for Parul Pandey, just 24 years old, were even more shocking. The blood pressure monitor pegged her status at 97/64.Of the 317-odd civic staffers who visited the medical camp on Thursday, 38 were found suffering from hypertension and unusual blood pressure while 41 staffers suffer from a blood sugar problem.However, of the 38 stressed-out staffers, 15 were diagnosed with the medical condition for the first time. Similarly, of the 41 diabetics identified, 23 were ignorant about their condition or had only just developed the lifestyle disease.While the staffers found to be suffering anxiety bouts and high blood pressure were over 35 years of age, the low blood pressure patients were found to be relatively younger. Two more staffers who complained about incessant coughing bouts were also directed for further medical examination to confirm whether they suffer from tuberculosis.Even amongst those already diabetic, one civic employee was pulled out of imminent medical emergency and directed to seek specialised medical attention after he registered a 506 blood sugar count, which is astronomically high, with 150 being in the normal range for adults.While low BP could also be caused by heredity, it is slowly becoming a lifestyle disease. What is worrying is that a small fraction of the BMC staffers (317) took advantage of the medical camp that we organised on the occasion of the International Health Day today. Had more staffers taken advantage of the camp the figures may have been more alarming, a senior BMC doctor who headed the camp told The Hindu on condition of anonymity.Two more staffers were required to provide blood samples that have been sent for laboratory tests for malaria, the results being expected on Saturday.Stress has become a way of life in almost all professions. We need to more actively pursue yoga and other de-stressing programmes for government employees if we are interested in their health and well being.

On October 8, he had written to the Chief Ministers of all States, including Maharashtra, specifying the immediate measures needed to be taken to alleviate the sufferings of the rural population.In his four-page letter, Mr Yadav had suggested that the Maharashtra government officially declare drought to prise open the funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund, take emergency measures to tackle the water crisis, implement the rural employment guarantee scheme and the State Employment Guarantee Scheme, restructure agri-loans, enhance ratio under the PDS, and compensate farmer for crop losses.On September 30, 2015, the monsoon ended, and it was clear on October 1 that Marathawada would face another drought. Had the government acted upon our suggestions, things would not have reached such severity, Mr. Yadva said, releasing his letter.In the letter, Mr. Yadav had suggested to the government to stop any diversion of water for non-essential purposes. He had suggested temporary ban on supply of water for water-intensive sugarcane crops, ban reopening of sugar factories, regulating drawing of water by bottling plants, stopping unauthorised diversion of water for industries.It is a crime against humanity to supply water to sugarcane crops when there is acute drinking water shortage. Activists have repeatedly pointed out how sugar factories are sucking out water in the Marathawada region, but yet in Latur, water was supplied to sugarcane farming, he said.I had suggested a temporary ban on water supply for sugarcane crop and sugar factories"

Bankers said the comment signals that the central bank is leaving the door open for further reductions.The rate cut could help lower the cost of loans for consumers, including automobile and home buyers.The RBI said easing price pressures had been a key factor in determining the policy stance and cited governments effective supply side measures keeping a check on food prices, and the governments commendable commitment to fiscal consolidation. Retail inflation slowed to 5.18 per cent in February after accelerating for six consecutive months.The repo rate, which is at its lowest in five years, will help banks reduce borrowing costs, helping boost economic growth. We have cut interest rates by 150 basis points since the beginning of the accommodative cycle, Dr. Rajan told reporters.The latest rate cut should be seen in the backdrop of banks reducing lending rates by 25 to 50 bps since adopting a new loan pricing mechanism  the marginal cost of funds based lending rate  in the first week of April, according to the RBI Governor.Policy action is more significant today than just a 25 basis points rate cut. Borrowing is now significantly cheaper and will continue to get so, he said.The RBI also announced measures to ease liquidity in the banking system. The daily requirement for maintaining cash reserve ratio has been reduced to 90 per cent from 95 per cent from April 16, the marginal standing facility rate (the penal rate at which banks borrow from the RBI) was cut by 75 basis points and the reverse repo rate (the rate banks earn when they park money with the RBI) raised by 25 bps.Policy actions... are not moving into the real economy as quickly as we would like, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said on Tuesday. So our focus is not so much on the sugar high of what the RBI can do in terms of rate cuts as on working in the areas of the economy where transmission is proving a problem."

They are waiting for us, Mr. Bhattacharya tells Jibesh Sarakar, secretary of the Darjeeling district committee of the CPI(M).The Left Font workers gather at the party office and go in a rally for a few hundred metres, bringing the traffic to a halt, before they are joined by Congress supporters. They then march together to the sub-divisional office for the filing of nomination of the Congress candidate.The bonhomie between the supporters of the Left Front and the Congress on the streets of Siliguri clearly shows that the much-touted Siliguri model of uniting the Opposition forces against the Trinamool Congress is working in this key constituency.Mr. Bhattacharya told The Hindu that the first step was bringing all parties in the Opposition together and ensuring that voters, irrespective of party affiliation, got the confidence to exercise their franchise without fear.We did not do any seat-sharing in Siliguri. What we said was Remove Trinamool Congress, Save Siliguri. Now this is being said all across West Bengal  Remove Trinamool Congress, Save Bengal, Mr. Bhattacharya said.He, however, said the success was a result of a sustained movement launched by the Left parties over the past few years on several civic and social issues.From being in the third position in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections  trailing behind the BJP and the Trinamool Congress  the Left Front, under Mr. Bhattacharya, not only made a turnaround but also successively brought the Congress to its side.Electoral understandingIt was the success of the united Opposition in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation polls in April 2015 that laid the ground for the Left-Congress electoral understanding for the Assembly elections.While Mr. Bhattacharya is hopeful that the Siliguri model can be successfully implemented across the State, people and politicians in the second largest town of the State feel that it is his charisma that has brought the two parties together.Subin Bhowmick, a secretary of the State Congress, sitting in an office not far from Mr. Bhattacharyas, said the model would not have been a success but for the veteran CPI(M) leader.Sports enthusiastThough pitted against Trinamool Congress candidate and football icon Baichung Bhutia, the former Left Front Minister, whenever asked about his opponent, starts a discussion on Mr. Bhutias soccer skills. A sports enthusiast, Mr. Bhattacharya said the election campaign had made him fitter and happier.All the walking for campaigning has kept my weight and blood sugar in check and made me happy because it allows me to be in constant touch with the masses, the 67-year-old leader said."

Srinivasa Rao, it is believed to be much higher.He said all reported incidents due to heat were being examined by divisional-level committees as sunstroke victims are entitled for a compensation of Rs. 50,000 under Apadhbandhu scheme.With temperatures hovering around 40 degree Celsius in most parts, hospitals in major towns have seen a spurt in such cases.Day temperatures continued to hover at four to five degrees above normal in open cast mines in the Kothagudem coal belt region. The searing heat in coal mining areas has prompted the Singareni Collieries Company Limited to initiate a health awareness campaign and distribution of ORS packets at pit-heads of OCPs in coal belt region.Campaign launchedKarimnagar Special Correspondent writes: Blistering heat is sweeping through the district with the mercury crossing 43 degrees Celsius has reportedly claimed 42 lives, most of them elderly, through the month of March. However, official reports state that only two people, in Bejjanki and Dharmaram mandals, died.A three-member committee comprising a Medical Officer, Tahsildar and Sub-Inspector of Police is said to be looking into sunstroke-related cases.Despite the searing heat, there are no reports of patients being admitted to hospitals. District Medical & Health Officer Dr. A. Rajesham said they had sensitised all the medical fraternity about the dos and don'ts when they come across sunstroke-related cases.A campaign to educate people on how to protect themselves apart, about five lakh oral rehydration salts (ORS) were given to medical staff on the field to be distributed among farm labour, besides an additional two lakh ORS packets each are to be distributed at the primary health centres and at the district headquarters.Hot winds make it worseAdilabad Special Correspondent adds: The summer so far in the district is characterised by the intensity of heat that has led to dislocation in normal life, in the form of a few sunstroke-related deaths that were however unconfirmed.Resident Medical Officer at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Adilabad, Dr. D. Vinay Kumar said no sunstroke death has occurred in the hospital.There are a few cases of dehydration that were reported but the reason are not the climate, he pointed out. Deaths were reported from the rural areas too where the intensity of the heat is felt more, due to lack of vegetation.In-charge of the Agriculture Research Station (ARS) here, D. Mohan Das said the intensity is such that if the maximum temperature is 42 degrees Celsius, it felt like 45 degrees Celsius, with hot winds blowing through the afternoons making it worse.On Tuesday, a maximum of 43.2 degrees Celsius was recorded at the ARS despite cloudy weather.Shortage of drinking waterWarangal Special Correspondent writes: Severe heat wave conditions coupled with acute drinking water shortage is giving tough time to people here.Though temperature ranging around 37 degrees Celsius could be quite normal, the hot winds were resulting in exhaustion and dehydration.About 10 deaths were reported in the past month due across the district. Worst-affected are the agricultural labour in rural parts.The usual 40 degree centigrade in April month was recorded in March this year indicating the severity of summer season. District collector Vakati Karuna said a massive campaign was launched to sensitise people over the dos and donts.The severity of the summer also led to a drastic fall of ground water level below 13 metres in Chennaraopet, Wardhannapet, Mahabubabad, Thorrur, Maripeda mandals, among others.Government has declared 11 mandals of the total 51 mandals as drought-hit and embarked on tackling the unemployment and drinking water shortage issues.Meanwhile, ground water expert Prof K V Jayakumar of NIT said the weather predictions indicate an early monsoon and normal rainy season.Going by the movement of winds from Southern hemisphere towards north, we are likely to get monsoon in Kerala coast in last week of May that indicates a normal rainy season, he explained.Sangareddy Staff Reporter adds: Temperatures between 41 and 43 degrees Celsius in the past week has sent alarm bells ringing in the district. Though two deaths were reported, officials attribute them to reasons other than sun stroke.However, primary health centres (PHC) have been receiving patients with symptoms-related sun stroke like dry tongue, unable to speak properly and skin becoming dry. The impact of the heat is being felt more at places like Alladurg, Naryanakhed and Zaheerabad.As a precaution, the administration made about 5 lakh ORS available free and they were placed at bus stands, hospitals, PHCs, anganwadis and in some pan shops too at some places.People are advised not to take aerated drinks as they were harmful due to chemicals. Instead, take butter milk, lemon water mixed with sugar and salt, Dr. Amar Singh, District Medical and Health Officer (DM&HO), told The Hindu .(Reporting by P. Sridhar, K.M. Dayashankar, S.

With powdered sugar or jaggery and dry fruits stuffed between two ultra thin, edible films made of rice, its a unique sweet and a favourite of crores of people.Behind the roll of sweet melting in the mouth once a bite is taken is a lengthy process that requires days of preparation and back-breaking labour before a hot pot. To make the pot suitable for making the edible films, a hole is made in it and it is alternately heated and wiped with a cloth dipped in oil for three days to smoothen the surface. To make the films, coarse rice is ground for nearly two hours and made into batter. It is diluted and a thin cloth dipped in the solution and put on the inverted pot with flame under it. Film forms on the pot in a jiffy in what appears to be sheer magic to the naked eye.The making of edible films and the sweet is a cottage industry confined to a few villages in East Godavari district, says P.V.K. Jagannadha Rao, Principal Scientist, All India Coordinated Research Project on Post Harvest Engineering and Technology (AICRP-PHET of ICAR), Regional Agricultural Research Station, Anakapalle, affiliated to Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University.Since it is a traditional sweet that is hugely popular and locally made it is eminently suitable for obtaining Geographical Indication-based patent on the lines of Tirupati laddu and Pochampally sari, he says. The making of putarekulu has the potential to provide livelihood to a large number of people with very little investment.RARS has studied the economic conditions and the making of the sweet at Atreyapuram, famed for its putarekulu and also at Vasprapuri near Rajam of Srikakulam district and collected the data. It is estimated a family making 200 putarekulu earns more than Rs.2,000 a day after counting out all expenses.The making of the edible films is carried out in the open in hot conditions. The study revealed that before the film is made the temperature is between 150 and 160 degree Celsius and after the film is taken it is 120 degrees.Provisional patentTo improve working conditions and to refine the process, the Anakapalle RARS has designed an electrically-operated machine to make the edible films under the technology programme of AICRP-PHET. We had taken the machine to Atreyapuarm and tried it out with T. Venkata Srirama Murthy and family for making the edible films. They have suggested a few modifications, including a little slant to the machine, regulating the temperature and Teflon coating to the top sheet rather than a Teflon sheet itself to reduce stickiness, Dr. Jagannadha Rao said. RARS has also applied for provisional patent with the Patent Office at Chennai.Regional agri research station has developed an electrically-operated machine"

He said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who toured the district on April 1 and 2, could not find time to meet people to get to know the famine conditions, but had the time to visit temples and perform pujas. He said that it is unfair on the part of Mr. Rao for not talking about the fate of NDSL (formerly NSF) and Nizamabad Cooperative Sugar Factory (NCSF). Appealing to the administration to release Rs.11 crore arrears due to the EGS workers, he said in the rural areas labourers are unable to find work even for Rs.50 a day.Mr. Venkat said that farmers are selling their cattle to slaughterhouses as it is very difficult to find fodder, besides scores of families are migrating to other areas, leaving behind the old and young at home, in search of employment.

Jaggery demand generally picks up around Ugadi, the Telugu New Year, with it being one of the main ingredients in the Ugadi pacchadi and the traditional sweets.Sriramanavami that comes a week later further drives the demand with widespread use of jaggery for the sweet syrup ""Panakam,"" a mixture of water and jaggery.Traders benefit""Demand picked up from parts of the State, mainly Guntur and Krishna Districts and upcountry markets in March. As a result, the lowest variety sharply rose from Rs.230 for 10 kgs to Rs.250. Deluxe variety is up from Rs.275 to Rs.340,"" says a prominent trader Korukonda Butchiraju of Anakapalle, one of the largest jaggery markets in the country.Traders who had built up stocks expecting a rise in the price following drought conditions and failure of crop in Maharashtra are laughing all the way to the bank.Arrivals till month-endUntil the demand picked up, about two-thirds of the stock used to comprise the inventory. But after the price spike, about 80 per cent of arrivals are going to the upcountry market and only the remaining is going to building the stock. With an estimated turnover of Rs.130 crore, the transactions in the market cover about 50,000 tonnes of jaggery.The arrival of stock lasts till the end of April. In the neighbouring Berhampore, medium variety of jaggery is selling at a staggering Rs.345 with stock not being abundantly available from other markets. With Sriramanavami approaching, the demand is likely to go up further.Crop failureOne of the main reasons for sharp rise in the demand is said to be crop failure in Maharashtra following acute drought conditions. Now jaggery sells at around Rs.54 a kg and sugar is far behind at Rs.38 in local stores. Market watchers say even sugar price has gone up of late."

Low physical activity, high carbohydrate diet and increasing stress in day to day life are the causes for increase in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Research in the field has led to new treatment options. The newer medications are effective in controlling the blood sugar with lesser side effects such as low blood sugar, weight gain and increased risk of heart attack. Gliflozins are the recent set of medications available to treat diabetes, which makes the person to pass excess glucose in the urine. This medicine in addition to reducing blood sugar also reduces the blood pressure, weight and does not cause low sugar. Gliptins are available for nearly 10 years and this reduces the blood sugars without causing low sugar or weight gain. GLP1 are set of injectable medicines available which would cause weight loss in patients in addition to reduction in blood sugar. Newer insulins are also available which can be injected with easy to use pen device. Degludec is ultra long acting insulin available to treat diabetes. It can be given at any time of the day, once daily, not related to meal intake. Low sugar problem is very less with this insulin. Measuring blood sugar is very important and we have a latest 14 day continuous blood sugar measuring device.The latest developments in the field of diabetes is to make a person with diabetes live longer without much restrictions.Diabetes along with Hypertension and Obesity are the commonest causes of kidney diseases. There are roughly 100,000 people developing end stage kidney disease each year, of which only 10% have the adequate resources to avail dialysis support or kidney transplantation. It is wise to prevent kidney diseases with healthy food & lifestyle rather than treating them. Though prevention should be our focus at present, we should also screen people who are likely to develop kidney diseases to diagnose and treat them early. At GKNM Hospital we provide comprehensive adult and Paediatric Nephrology services. We have the first of its kind Hybrid dialysis machine in Coimbatore with which we can dialyse even the critically unstable patient!

The diabetes-associated complications in the population is quite alarming, the document says. It notes that there is no proper system at present for the adequate monitoring and follow-up of people detected with diabetes and to encourage them to improve their blood sugar control or adherence to control strategies. Many unscientific systems of medicine, quacks, and advertisements offering cure for diabetes are doing immense damage, it says. The document calls upon administrators and policy makers to improve the infrastructure in government hospitals for the proper and all-round management of diabetes, training for doctors on the scientific management of various aspects of diabetes to prevent complications and most importantly, ensuring the free and uninterrupted supply of medicines, including insulin, for treating all aspects of diabetes.The primary focus of infrastructure development and policy guidelines should be on preventive care, periodic screening and monitoring of people, mass awareness campaigns to encourage healthy lifestyle and ensuring community participation in all preventive measures and policies at the grassroots level. The IMA policy document on diabetes will be released on Thursday by Health Minister V.S. Sivakumar and Mayor V.K. Prashant."

These risk factors are genetic, environmental and lifestyle related, say endocrinologists.Both diabetes and GD are increasingly common. Obesity, genetic and environmental factor up the risk of diabetes, which, during pregnancy, can manifest as GD in such high-risk women, said Dr. G. Arun, senior endocrinologist at Yashoda Hospitals. The risk of TDM notwithstanding, uncontrolled GD is associated with congenital malformations, besides babies being born with abnormal sugar and calcium levels.The World Health Organization estimates there are about a lakh women aged between 30 and 70 years. If a recently published research paper is any indication, a substantial number of Indian diabetic women who gave birth may have increased their risk of TDM with a history of GD.Published in the journal Diabetic Medicine, the paper based its findings on women studied at Owaisi Hospital and MHRT in Hyderabad, and AIIMS in New Delhi. It showed an increased risk of TDM for women with GD. Of the 366 women with GD, 119 had developed DM in five years, while 144 developed prediabetes, a precursor to diabetes characterised by higher than normal sugar levels, which, if left untreated, progresses to DM.According to a meta-analysis published last year by one of the current studys authors Dr. Roya Rozati, women with history of GD may have as much as eight times higher risk of developing TDM when compared to women with normal levels of glucose tolerance during pregnancy.The incidence of TDM was lowered in our cohort as women underwent lifestyle modification after delivery. Maintaining healthy BMI and capping it at under 27 is key to lowering risk of GDM and subsequent TDM, said Dr. Rozati, who heads the city-based MHRT Infertility Centre. The paper also showed that the risk of TDM increases with age, higher body-mass index and the presence of condition called acanthosis nigricans, skin hyper-pigmentation seen in those with insulin resistance.Both diabetes and GD are increasingly common.

Yeddyurappa has decided against using the Rs. 1-crore luxury SUV, given by industrialist-cum-party colleague Murugesh Nirani, for his tour of drought-hit areas.Mr. Yeddyurappa told reporters here on Saturday that he would travel by train to the drought-hit areas, not by the luxury car.He will visit the districts of Bidar, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, and Vijayapura from April 27 to May 1.It was announced on Friday that Mr. Yeddyurappa would use the SUV for the visit.The BJP leader had defended Mr. Nirani saying he had given the luxury vehicle to him for comfortable travel.While this had come under criticism from the public and the ruling Congress, BJP leaders are of the view that the party central leadership could also have having advised him against using the luxury car for the tour.Making it clear that the car was not a gift, Mr. Yeddyurappa said he would return the car in due course, but use it for other travel purposes. His plan to use the luxury car for touring the drought-hit areas embarrassed even the BJP leaders who felt it would appear insensitive to the plight of the affected people.Nirani, a defaulterMr. Niranis sugar factory has defaulted on dues of more than Rs. 100 crore to farmers. This has angered the Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association.Mr. Yeddyurappa should show his commitment to farmers by immediately directing Mr. Nirani to sell the SUV, which has been bought in the name of his company, and settle the dues of at least a few farmers from that money, association president Kurubur Shanthkumar said.Expressing dissatisfaction over Mr. Yeddyurappa accepting the luxury car from Mr. Nirani, he said: We want leaders like Mr. Yeddyurappa, who heads the Opposition party, to be aggressive with industrialists who default on farmers dues by colluding with the government. If Mr. Yeddyurappa accepts the luxury SUV from Mr. Nirani now, he will not be in a position to rein him in if he becomes Chief Minister later, Mr. Shanthkumar said.He said the association was considering moving court against Mr. Niranis sugar factory for its failure to pay dues to farmers.According to sources, Nirani Sugars is yet to clear dues of Rs. 197.57 crore to sugarcane growers for the crushing season 201516 and another Rs. 18.38 crore for 201314. The sugar mill, however, made full payment for 201415. At a press meet in Bengaluru on Saturday, Congress leader V.S.

But it took the spotlight away from the daily struggles of lakhs facing the most immediate consequences of an extended drought and acute water scarcity in Latur district. The vagaries of nature have already taken their toll, the farmer in the hinterland has no way out, and the common man clings to a collapsing water infrastructure in the cramped city space.Nitin Kalantary, CEO, Kalantry Food Products Limited, a leading exporter and supplier of pulses from Latur, says, Scarce water availability has resulted in poor farm yield, low income and diminishing spending power of the farmers. The weddings lack the pomp, while festivities are curtailed both in urban and rural areas. It has never been like this before.Falling outputThe local Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) turnover fell to Rs 905 crore in 2015-16 from Rs 1,460 cr the previous year and Rs 1,875 cr in 2013-14. The drop in the arrival of pigeon pea from 15,000 quintal last year to only 5,000 this year is an indicator of the crashing economy, say experts.Drought and water scarcity is a complex phenomenon.The district administration blames natures vagaries while the oilseed and pulses lobby point fingers at the water-guzzling sugarcane crop. The politicians, of course, blame each other. Geographically, too, the impact of the current crisis varies across regions.Northeastern Maharshtra Jalkot, Ahmedpur, Deoni, Nitur and Udgir  are facing more of a hydrological drought and scarcity as compared to the slightly better off and greener northwestern belt of Renapur, Latur City and Ausa, which are hit by both an agricultural and meteorological drought. But they are also home to three powerful sugar factories and major sources of water, including the Manjara dam, and the Bhandarwadi barrage among others.Sugarcane to blame?The western belt grew around the big three: Manjara, Raina and Vikas sugar factories; the banks too belong to the same politicians. The cyclical economy was complete once they got better access to water from the barrages. It is this economy that is facing the prospect of a collapse, says Sudhir Mane of NAAM foundation started by actor Nana Patekar which offers funds as drought relief for farmers.The ground water level at Jalkot has gone down to an alarming 4.7 metres; at Ahmedpur it is touching 4.38m and at Deoni it is 4.08m. According to guidelines of the Ground Water Act, levels below 1 metre are termed manageable scarcity, those below 2 metres as critical and below 3 metres are declared alarming. The district hit the danger mark in October with an average fall of 3.53 metre across the ten talukas.In contrast, the East has fewer barrages and dams; existing ones have gone bone dry because of three years of deficient monsoon. At the 33 small water projects at Ahmedpur, having a capacity of 14.4 mcm (million cubic metre), the current water availability is zero. In the 10 water projects, with a capacity of 25.26 mcm at Jalkot, every single drop has disappeared. Ironically, the belt falls in the assured rainfall zone with an expected 700 mm to 800 mm of monsoon as compared to prosperous western sugar belt which is a declared drought prone areas programme (DPAP) Rainfall Zone with less than 500 mm of average rainfall.The east was never meant for development as water here doesnt flow with gravity; [the area] being on an elevation, the soil is somehow less fertile than the west. Water used for sugarcane as opposed to the perception of being wasted, always percolated back into the soil in the western belt, says Vaijnathrao Shinde, former Congress legislator from Latur Rural and director of Vikas Cooperative Sugar Factory near Niwali in the western belt.The shifting rainfall pattern is the biggest cause of crop failure, which has hit both kharif and rabi sowing this year. For example, the average July rainfall in 2013 and a year before was 331.54 mm but in 2015 it was just 31.7 mm in Latur. The number of rain days in a year is now reduced to 36 in Latur and 37 in Beed, leading to reduction in rain precipitation and hence, poor ground water availability. The rainfall deficit in the district has been 50.12 per cent in 2014, and 47.94 per cent in 2015.For four years (2009-2013) I grew sugarcane but with falling market prices and changing rain pattern I chose soyabean after taking a loan of Rs 40,000. But that crop failed, I had to sell three of my seven cattle to repay the loan. The vicious cycle never ends, says Dayanand Ashokrao, 26, who has a four acre farm near the Raina sugar factory.There was no rain in June in the region, some in July and in most parts concentrated around August, and back again in October with devastating hailstorms in February. This mean it becomes challenging for a farmer to opt for pulses (pigeon-pea, urad and moong) and easier to go for oilseeds (soyabean). With only 1.72 per cent water remaining in 141 small and big sources of water, the district officials estimate failure of in excess of 70 per cent of the kharif crop.As many as 125 farmers suicides were reported from Latur district till July 2015."

Roja visited the fasting leader and attributed the delay in the announcement of the railway zone to the failure of the BJP and TDP MPs, and Union Ministers from the State.They (Union Ministers and ruling party MPs) have not taken up the cause in right earnest. The Chief Minister is only interested in purchasing MLAs from other parties, she said.Accident victimsShe ridiculed Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao for participating in the Telugu film Sarainodu audio function instead of calling on the Nakkapalli road accident victims.The Centre had released the list of top 100 universities in the country but not one institution from the State figured in it, which was a failure of the HRD Minister, she said.The new railway zone would bring more jobs for the youth and new trains to the State, she added.Jagan to continue fast?Later, at a separate media conference, YSRC leader Botcha Satyanarayana said that an all-party meeting would be convened near the Gandhi-statue on Monday to chalk out the course of action.He took a dig at MP K. Haribabu for hailing the allocation of a mere Rs.1 lakh for the Vizag Metro project.YSRC president Y.S.

File PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMThe delay by the management of Mysore Paper Mills (MPM), a public sector undertaking in Bhadravati, to enter into an agreement on purchasing sugarcane has created a lot of apprehension among farmers.The MPM has a paper and a sugar production unit. In the year 2015-16, the sugar factory of MPM had crushed over 1.25 lakh tonne of sugarcane.In Shivamogga district, sugarcane is cultivated in an area of 4,000 hectares. More than 80 percent of the farmers here provide sugarcane to MPM. N.H. Deva Kumar, district unit convener of Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association, told The Hindu that, every year, the management entered into an agreement with the farmers over purchasing sugarcane during March and April, and it was unfortunate that the process had not commenced so far this year.Mr. Kumar said that MPM is one of the few firms in the State that abides by the State Advisory Price fixed by the government. If there is further delay in entering into a contract, the farmers will have to supply sugarcane to the jaggery production units. Many owners of jaggery production units make payments to the farmers after the clearing of their stocks, creating problems for the later, he said.The legal problems with regard to resumption of production at MPM have been resolved. The State government should immediately direct the management of MPM to enter into the agreement with the sugarcane growers, he said. The association had staged a protest before the MPM factory on April 15.The senior officials of the firm, who spoke to the farmers, have assured them that they would apprise the management of their demands and discuss the issue in the forthcoming meeting with the administrative board. Mr. Kumar said that protests would be intensified if there is further delay in fulfilment of the demand."

He had also said that no new permission for beer factories will be given if the region is facing an acute water shortage.But controversy erupted a week ago, when Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, on a Marathwada tour, demanded a complete ban on water supply to breweries in the region. States Water Resources minister Girish Mahajan too had similar suggestions.This time it was another Bharatiya Janata Party Minister, Pankaja Munde, who opposed the idea, bringing the issue of livelihood of workers and economics.Sensing an opportunity, the opposition targeted Ms Munde over her comments.Nationalist Congress Party spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged that Ms Mundes comments were to protect the business interests of her husband, a director of a company that had a distillery at Shendra MIDC, which receives water from the Jayakwadi dam.The State has already said it woulde not give permission to new sugar factories in Marathwada for the next five years, as they require a huge quantity of water.Earlier on Wednesday, the State government announced its proposal to prepare a scientific environment plan for Maharashtra.

With major political players having announced their respective nominees for the constituency, the stage is set for high-pitched battle this time too.While contesting candidates have rolled up their sleeves setting out on the field to garner support with a set of promises, the electorate have their own wish lists with profound expectations that those would be fulfilled.Reposing confidence in its MLA A. Soundarapandian, the DMK has retained him in the same seat where he won twice in a row  in 2006 and 2011. After a gap of 10 years, the AIADMK is back in the fray in the constituency by fielding M. Vijayamoorthy as its nominee. In the 2011 election, the AIADMK had given the seat to its then ally DMDK which lost the election.The entry of M. Jayaseelan, a nominee of the CPI-M which is a part of the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam  headed Peoples Welfare Front has made it a multi-cornered fight.While political parties make their own calculations based on caste, the support of new voters will be crucial in determining the outcome of the Assembly election.In a constituency where Udayars, Mutharayars, and Dalits account for a sizeable chunk, the DMK and the AIADMK have played it safe fielding their nominees belonging to Udayar and Mutharayar communities respectively. The CPI(M) has fielded a Dalit candidate  a well-known face in Lalgudi  who had taken up key issues concerning the farmers and the common man.Unfazed by multi-cornered contest, Mr. Soundarapandian says that he would drive home to the electorate the schemes implemented during the DMK regime in the constituency and what the party intended to execute in future.Banking on the developmental schemes implemented in the last five years, AIADMK functionaries say they were leaving no stone unturned to woo the electorate so as to wrest the seat from the DMK after a decade. The DMK MLA had been accused of not improving the constituency in his two terms.Well aware of public issues and one who is connected with the masses, Mr. Jayaseelan says his prime focus would be on the farm sector and on solving the problems faced by the agriculturists so as to stop people from shifting out of this profession. He accuses both Dravidian parties of not fulfilling the expectations of the electorate in the constituency all these years.Representatives of farmers bodies want due importance to be accorded to agriculture in this fertile belt. Uninterrupted power supply is what farmer needs, say representatives of farmers associations.The demand for opening a government cooperative sugar mill in Lalgudi to benefit cane growers is pending for long, says Ayilai Sivasuriyan, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam.A government cement factory and a cotton procurement centre in the arid Pullabadi area was a definite need of the hour to benefit cotton growers and providing employment opportunities, says P. Viswanathan, State president, Tamizhaga Eeri and Aatru Paasana Vivasayigal Sangam. Dredging of water bodies, construction of check dams at various points in the Coleroon and establishment of shutters at Koogur in the river would substantial improve water table thus benefitting farmers. Checking sand mining beyond permitted level is warranted in the present situation to save their livelihood, say farmers. Amid these expectations, the die is cast for an intense battle with both Dravidian parties working hard to bag the seat.With Peoples Welfare Front in the fray, a keen tussle is definitely on the cards.Industrial activity is virtually absent in the constituency, dominated by farmers"

Harish Chandra Yerme holds the dubious distinction of having dug 63 borewells on his 40-acre Mosambi farm, some as deep as 1,000 feet even though the norms permit only 200 feet. These have been sunk over 10 years, and half of them are not even working. They were needed to keep the farm going in this non-irrigated belt, says caretaker Shankar Dusnale.The indiscriminate use of groundwater has been the bane of Latur. The number of irrigation bore wells in Latur stood at 34,778 in 2007, only second after Nashik at 37,545. As per the rules, there can be only five borewells per square kilometre. This simply means, in an ideal situation, the 715 sq km of the 10 talukas should have only 3,575 bores. But the unofficial number is 90,000. People are not reporting these  the mentality of digging bores must change, says M.S. Sheikh, in charge of the local ground water survey and development agency (GSDA).A 2012 GDSA report warned of over-withdrawal of groundwater in Latur and Osmanabad, due to the water intensive cash crop like sugarcane, banana, grapes and oranges, which are mostly groundwater dependent. However, even after knowing the disadvantages of irrigation borewell  low dependability of yield, low discharge and recuperation rate  farmers were still opting for it, the report said.Latur was never a water sufficient zone, and the sugarcane should have never been grown here without drip irrigation. It is one of the main reasons for the scarcity. But a powerful sugar lobby kept getting incentives from the government, while oilseeds and pulses got no encouragement, explains Ashok Bhutada, chairman of Kirti Agro Limited, a leading dealer in soyabean.The growing feeling is that sugarcanes commodity cycle has to end. While cane farmers are being offered unattractive rates by loss-making sugar factories, there has been a rise in the rates of soyabean and pulses.However, Lalitbhai Shah, chairman of the Latur APMC, says: Yes, sugarcane consumes more water, but without it, the entire western Latur economy will collapse. Why is everyone trying to enlighten the farmer? The message to grow or not grow a crop must come to him from the market.The charge against sugarcane is it guzzles over 2,000 mm water in a year, forcing farmers to sink borewells. Initially, factory owners too did not promote drip irrigation. But Yashwant Rao Patil, former chairman of Raina Sugar Cooperative, says: Nearly 60 per cent of the crop our factory promoted was with drip irrigation. Blaming sugarcane that had an annual economy of Rs 1,000 crore and improved the lives of farmers is a bit unfair.When the water express chugged into Latur City last week with 5,00,000 litres, people hoped it would end the citys crisis.But residents say water supply has been erratic for the past year, with the poorer parts getting water once every 25 days, while some better-off areas got it every fortnight.The problem is the drought mentality comes back to haunt us again with several schemes and rejuvenation plans put in place after a crisis, but it is forgotten as soon as monsoon arrives, says water conservation expert Amol Govande."

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMSugarcane cultivators in the district staged a demonstration against the Union government for fixing Rs. 2,300 per tonne of sugarcane as the fair and remunerative price (FRP) for the 2015-16 season.The agitation, spearheaded by the State Sugarcane Cultivators Association, said that the FRP was Rs. 788 below the actual cost of production and hence was anti-farmer in nature.The protest against the Centre was part of a State-wide agitation by the association and organised in front of the office of the BJPs Pratap Simha, Mysuru MP, here on Monday.Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar said that the cost of cultivating one tonne of sugarcane was Rs. 3,088 while the Centre has fixed the FRP for 2016-17 at Rs. 2,300 per tonne.Describing the move as a betrayal of farmers interests, Mr. Shanthakumar said tha tthe BJP had promised in the run up to the Parliamentary elections in 2014 that it would implement the recommendations of the Dr. Swaminathan Committee that the FRP would be one-and-half times the cost of production to give succour to the farmers.But instead it has fixed the FRP which is below the cost of production and amounts to betraying the farmers interest, he said.The farmers argued that the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), whose mandate is to recommend the minimum support price, had government officials with no knowledge of agricultural issues and problems plaguing the cultivators and hence should be disbanded immediately.At least 50 per cent of the officials of the CACP should comprise farmers, said Mr. Shanthakumar who demanded that the FRP should be at least match the cultivation cost if not more.Explaining the economics of cultivation, the association said that 35 tonnes of sugarcane can be cultivated on an acre of land at a cost of Rs.108,080 which includes the cost of cutting, transportation besides the cost of preparing the land.While the government has fixed FRP at Rs. 2,300 per tonne, the income accrued to the sugar mills per tonne of crushing sugarcane was Rs. 4,230. This includes Rs. 3,300 for sugar (at 10 per cent recovery) per 100 kg, Rs.700 for cogeneration, Rs.180 for molasses and Rs.50 for compost, according to the association."

As politicians canvass this election season, they need to factor in these aspects as well as the caste tensions that escalate every now and then in a couple of districts.The poorly developed districts of Cuddalore, Villupuram, Tiruvannamalai, Kancheepuram, Vellore and Tiruvallur, with 59 Assembly constituencies among them, perhaps hold the key for the resurgence of the DMK, provided it can brave the threat posed by the third front and that of the PMK. The floods have dented the image of the ruling AIADMK in this region, with people recounting inefficient relief and rehabilitation measures and alleged partisan behaviour of party men and officials in post-flood response.In Cuddalore, the worst hit by the floods, complaints of relief money not reaching peoples bank accounts echo from different parts. They [officials] came and surveyed the damage. But we are yet to get the relief money. We have no hopes either, says Balu of Poondiankuppam in Kurinjipadi.Farmers in Villupuram, Cuddalore and Tiruvannamalai criticise the government for fixing an unreasonably low compensation for the crop damage. The Rs. 13,500 per hectare would not cover the cost of production for even an acre. I had sugarcane and groundnut on my six acres. I have met the officials several times but I am yet to get the compensation. I had to take loans for new crop, says A. Ramasamy of Devanur in Tiruvannamalai.The abysmally low rainfall for straight four years since 2011 created a drought-like situation in Tiruvannamalai and the water table went down drastically. This pulled down agricultural production. Coupled with drought, lack of fair pricing for paddy, sugar mills audacity not to give State-advised price for cane and the systematically dwindling groundnut area have crippled the agricultural economy.Though Tiruvannamalai used to be one of the leading paddy producing districts in the State, its farmers failed to get drought relief while their politically influential brethren in the delta managed to squeeze some relief. After the rains are bountiful in 2015, people expected good turn in the paddy yield, but the brown plant hopper diseases hit the crops in epidemic proportion and affected both the productivity and pricing.Accusation of ruling party members intervening with officials and recommending relief for their own supporters was something heard across districts.In Vellore, the delay in executing the Thenpennai-Palar River linking project has turned into a huge disappointment. Farmers for long have been urging the government to declare this district drought-prone and take remedial measures. Due to acute water scarcity, coconut cultivation has been severely hit in the last several years. Cultivators also blame the tanneries for the continuing pollution of water bodies.In many parts of Villupuram, lack of employment opportunities dominates the woes of the voters. With inadequate irrigation facilities, farming is confined to a few months in places like Kurinjipadi and Ulundurpet. It is in such areas that schemes like 20 kg free rice and goats and cow distribution have become a huge hit.As one moves to Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, unequal development stares one in the face.

DHA enhances learning and memory. It is abundant in wild salmon and, to a lesser extent, in other fish and fish oil, as well as walnuts, flaxseed, co-senior author Fernando Gomez-Pinilla, an UCLA professor, pointed out.Testing effectsTo test the effects of fructose and DHA, the researchers trained rats to escape from a maze, and then divided the animals into three groups. For the next six weeks, one group of rats drank water with an amount of fructose that would be roughly equivalent to a person drinking a litre of soda per day. The second group was given fructose water and a diet rich in DHA. The third received water without fructose and no DHA.After the six weeks, the rats were put through the maze again. The animals that had been given only the fructose navigated the maze about half as fast than the rats that drank only water  indicating that the fructose diet had impaired their memory.  IANS"

Memories from 30 years ago come rushing back as he enters the defunct sugarcane factory which had its first run in 1979. His eyes light up when he sees the central unit, which comprised clanking baskets that once moved at high speed to turn molasses into sugar crystals. There was no sight better than that of millions of tiny shining crystals tumbling out of here, he reminisces.At its peak, the Kada Sahkari Sakhar Karkhana (KSSK), in the drought-hit Ashti taluka of Beed district, produced 3,03,169 tonnes of sugar in 1981-82. From then on, it kept falling, to touch 3,000 tonnes on the last day of production in 2014. The factory shut down because of falling production and rising debts.The KSSK was taken over from Bhimrao Dhonde, BJP legislator from Ashti, by cooperative banks of Aurangabad and was later attached by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation on November 11, 2015, for non-payment of arrears.Nearly 10 sugar factories in Marathwada, of them five in Beed district, have shut down due to bad debts and falling production in the wake of poor monsoon. Of the 76 factories across Maharashtra, 30 have shut shop while production has crashed from about 20 lakh tonnes a couple of years ago to just 3.5 lakh tonnes last year. The debate around sugarcane rages on in Marathwada, more fiercely now with the State governments decision to ban licensing of new factories.This is a welcome move by the government. This crop is not in the interest of farmers in Marathwada even though they have made a good living out of it. I believe that this drought in Marathwada is man-made and sugarcane alone has played a 70-per cent part, Indias waterman and Ramon Magsaysay award winner Rajendra Singh told The Hindu .Sugarcane continues to divide the academic discourse as well. Agriculture experts and agro-scientists who blame sugarcane for the current water crisis in Marathwada claim the cash crop guzzles up to three crore litres an acre of water annually. Those in favour, peg this number at 1.5 crore litres with the flow irrigation technique and nearly half of that with micro irrigation methods. Those criticising claim soyabean and chickpea only uses less than 50 lakh litres.I want to ask those who are against sugarcane as to what is the scientific source of their information. A picture is being painted that growing sugarcane is a crime, without appreciating that lives of hundreds of farmers have improved over the years, said B.B. Thombare, chairman of Natural Sugar and Allied Limited at Osmanabad. Having carried out an experiment on a 50-acre plot in Latur between 2007-2008, the mill managed a yield of 110 tonnes of cane an acre with just 7 ft furrow and water utilisation of 1.5 crore litres on an average annually. Unperturbed by the criticism of cane, the farmer in the water-sufficient areas around canals and river basins here still swears by the reliability and dependability of the crop, while those in the parched interiors who have already suffered one or more crop loss sound a note of caution. With enough water from the Godavari basin, my cane yield touched 40 tonnes per acre last year. So far, I havent felt the need for installing drip irrigation, says Sadashiv Ramesh of Georai taluka in Beed. There are those who criticise the preferential treatment sugarcane has received from the government over the years.The flow and sources of water in Marathwada were all tamed and manipulated for the benefit of the powerful sugar lobby over the years, says Tukaram Yelale, producer and exporter of fruits and grapes and chairman of Krishi Vikas Export, Latur.While some farmers swear by the crop, others blame it forthe drought"

About 5,000 employees used to work in the plant, but the company has retained only 120 persons for its important needs such as fire and security. The company removed outsourcing staff and has not paid salaries for regular employees for the last two months.

The employees have launched relay hunger strike at 7 Road junction seeking the governments intervention for continuation of mining activity. The State government organises partnership summits to attract more investments. But it is not interested to extend support to existing industries. It should come to their rescue in the interest of locals. Otherwise, many people will be forced to migrate to other areas, said a senior employee of the company.Several jute factories in Rajam and Srikakulam have cut down production with the stiff competition from Bangladesh jute products.
