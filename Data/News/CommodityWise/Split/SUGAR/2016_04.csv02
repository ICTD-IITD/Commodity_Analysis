Yeddyurappa interacting with farmers at the Jidga Mutt in Aland taluk on Thursday. PHOTO: Arun KulkarniThe former Chief Minister and president of the State-unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) B.S. Yeddyurappa has said that there was no proposal before the Union government to write off crop loans availed by farmers from nationalised banks.Interacting with farmers of the drought-affected Aland taluk at the Jidga Mutt on Thursday, he said that the government was more interested in ensuring remunerative prices for the farm produce and real-time insurance compensation to farmers in the event of crop loss.Mr. Yeddyurappa said the Union government has extended crop loans at 3 per cent interest in nationalised banks.On complaints from farmers that cooperative societies have started the process of recovering crop loans, he said that the Union government has directed the cooperative societies and the banks not to initiate the loan recovery process.Mr. Yeddyurappa said that there should not be any discrimination in fixing of sugarcane price in the State and it should be uniform across the State.He agreed with a farmer who complained that the sugarcane growers in Hyderabad Karnataka region were paid less when compared to their counterparts in the districts of south Karnataka.It is unfortunate that the State government was not in a position to ensure that the State Administered Price of Rs. 2,250 per tonne of sugarcane supplied to the sugar factories was implemented in the State, he said.He also agreed with another farmer and said that the government should divert water from the Bhima to Amarja Dam which has been starved off water due to the construction of barrages in the upstream by Maharashtra. He said this would provide water to a number of villages, Aland town and the Central University of Karnataka campus.Later, Mr Yeddyurappa left for Jewargi to interact with drought-affected farmers.He was accompanied by Bhagwant Khuba, MP, former minister Revu Naik, Amarnath Patil, MLC, Shashil G. Namoshi, former MLC and Doddappa Gowda Patil Naribol, former MLA.Fixing of sugarcane price should be uniform in the State, says Yeddyurappa"

He also lashed out at the sugar factories in these districts, claiming the water used for sugarcane crushing could have been used for drinking purposes.The attack by Mr Khadse, a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, is aimed at the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders who enjoy undisputed dominance in the cooperative sugar industry.In addition, the states sugar belt has stood with these two parties in elections, including the 2014 assembly polls.Last week, NCP chief Sharad Pawar criticised those holding sugarcane cultivation responsible for the drought. He said the producers of sugarcane were not big industrialists but farmers residing in the state and holding them responsible for the drought was not proper.I do not want to comment on what he (Sharad Pawar) said. But tough decisions have to be taken in a situation like drought. Had they not used unlimited water on sugarcane in districts such Latur, Beed and Osmanabad, we could have saved it for drinking now, he said, after a state-level preparatory meeting for the Kharif season.Kishor Tiwari, a farmer activist who heads a mission to reduce farm distress and arrest farmer suicides, too has called for a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation in the drought-hit regions.Mr Khadse reiterated his statement he made in the budget session of the legislature, accusing the Manjara cooperative sugar mill of snatching drinking water for sugarcane crushing.The mill is controlled by Amit Deshmukh, Congress MLA and son of former Chief Minister, the late Vilasrao Deshmukh.Indicating that strict regulations would be imposed on water-intensive cash crops, Mr Khadse said the government was planning to make drip irrigation and sprinkler system mandatory for sugarcane cultivation. There have to be certain restrictions on the amount of water being used for crops such as sugarcane and banana. How long can we tolerate this? he asked.Government may think of restrictions on sugarcane cultivation in drought-hit areas"

The district administration achieved significant success with their experiment to sell sugar seized from factories at a price higher than the market price.The gram panchayats in Mannalli in Bidar and Telgaon in Bhalki taluk will be registered as sellers on online platforms. They will encourage farmers to store their produce at village-level godowns, and sell them when they feel the price is right.As a first step, the zilla panchayat will collect the details of types and quantities of crops grown in each hobli, or a group of gram panchayats. Officials will also study the market trends of the crop and its varieties, as market records have been maintained in the district.Construction of godownsThe second step would involve the construction of godowns or storage units in each of the 186 gram panchayats. Work on building 145 godowns, each of a 60 tonne capacity, under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), is under progress. These will be built according to international parameters with pest and snake-resistant platforms and minimal ventilation to contain moisture variation and fungus attacks.They will also be provided with a computer and an internet connection.Modern silos to store grains scientifically will be built in each of the 30 hobli headquarters, using funds available under the Backward Regions Grant Fund. These will have a larger capacity to store grains, compared to the village-level godowns.Two workshops on how to sell food grains on NCDEX will be held for panchayat Development Officers, and officers of the agriculture produce marketing committee and agriculture department and farmers in the select gram panchayats.Some of the grains will also be procured locally, said deputy commissioner (DC) Anurag Tewari.Red gramRed gram has been sown on around 50,000 hectares in the district and the yield is expected to cross 77,000 tonnes this year. The district administration plans to buy all the red gram needed in Anganwadis and primary schools, locally. This will be processed in the Dal mills in the district and supplied through the mid-day meal scheme, according to the DC.Around three lakh tonnes of green gram have been harvested in the district, but the farmers do not have a fair price. Around 25,000 tonnes of black gram and around 3 lakh tonnes of soya is expected to be grown this kharif season. If the online sales system starts functioning properly in one month, we can provide competitive prices to all these crops, the DC said.Eliminating middlemenAt a meeting on Monday, deputy commissioner Anurag Tewari said the project would be extended to the whole district if it succeeds. Pawan Kumar Malpati, zilla panchayat chief executive officer, said the panchayats will create awareness among farmers about online sale of farm produce. This will empower them and help escape from the clutches of middlemen, he said.The zilla panchayat will collect the details of the types and quantities of crops in each hobli"

The government should also give importance to the completion of the Varahi Irrigation Project.The construction of only the first phase of the project had been completed and water was being supplied to some parts through canals. When fully completed, it would help grow sugarcane in the district.Coconut was one of the main horticultural crops of the district. As the price of coconut had crashed, the Union government had announced a support price of Rs. 16 per kg of coconut. But many farmers in the district were complaining that they were facing problems in getting it.Arecanut growers were facing a tough time. The price of arecanut, which was Rs. 60,000 per quintal last year, had now crashed to Rs. 25,000. The State unit of the BJP had appealed to the Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman and she had promised to look into the demand for providing support price.Yet another problem faced by the farmers in the district was that their crops were subject to attacks by wild animals such as boars, wild buffaloes, monkeys and others. The compensation given for this was too inadequate. The government should work out a proper compensation package for crop loss due to attack by wild animals.Land rightsThe farmers of the district had for a long time demanding rights over the kumki land, which was grassland. These could be used for grazing cattle and the grass could be used as organic manure on fields."

And, under the impact of Hudhud in 2014-15, the stocks fell to 21 lakh lumps, and the total arrivals for the year were only 27 lakh lumps.By the end of this February, the arrivals stand at 19 lakh, one lakh more than last year, according to market sources.But the market suffered a setback with only four lakh lumps in last March as against the normal eight to nine lakh.Drought in MaharashtraHowever, with timely rain this year and no other affecting factor that could cause any disturbance, we expect the arrivals to pick up, says noted trader Korukonda Butchiraju of Anakapalle.A major factor that is influencing building the inventory is the poor state of sugarcane crop in Maharashtra with less sowing area owing to drought conditions, he says. As a result, the price of sugar has shot up by about Rs.1,000 a quintal compared to last year.With proportionate increase in jaggery price too, the medium to top quality that is generally in the range of Rs.2,300 to Rs.2,600 is expected to go up to Rs.3,000 to Rs.3,300.But building up stocks of 1,500 truck loads last year, traders incurred loss and initially it appeared that they would bring down the inventory to 1,000 to 1,200 truck-loads this year. But in view of the sugar situation and prospect of rise in prices, the stocks may finally surpass 1,500 truck-loads, Mr. Butchiraju analyses.The jaggery season at Anakapalle, with a turnover of Rs.125 crore, starts from October-November and stock arrivals begin in January peaking between February and April. Traders offload the stocks from June/July."

Farmers are helpless as the animals are huge in size and cannot be scared away. Clearing of seemai karuvelam will help greatly in reducing this menace, said K. Thanikodi, a farmer.N. Palanichamy, State President of Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, said that the district administration should also take action to remove the seemai karuvelam growth in private properties.In many places, particularly near Tirumangalam, vast tracts of private land are left unused and they are filled with seemai karuvelam. The revenue administration should order removal of seemai karuvelam from these properties ,  he said.Demanding simplification of government procedures, farmers complained that even if they wanted to remove seemai karuvelam growth from nearby waterbodies, getting approval from different departments was daunting.Responding to the demands, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that he would convene a meeting with senior officials from revenue, forest and Public Works Department to devise a workable strategy.We will classify seemai karivelam growth into three categories  very dense, dense and moderately dense  and fix a price per ton so that interested parties can pay the amount to panchayats and take the wood for charcoal and other purposes, he said.Farmers also complained during the meeting about non-payment of dues by the National Cooperative Sugar Mills. Mr. Palanichamy said that the government had set the price at Rs. 2,750 per tonne but the company had paid only Rs. 2,300 per tonne. The remaining amount has been pending for the past 10 months, he alleged.An official from the mill said that they were awaiting sanction of money from the government to clear the dues.Around Rs. 6 crore should be settled for Madurai farmers. We are expecting to settle it soon, the official said.Non-clearance of encroachments at several places by the PWD was highlighted by several farmers at the meeting.The Collector ordered officials for swift action.

Consuming junk food regularly leads to complications like obesity, chronic illness, low self-esteem and even depression.To bring down junk food consumption among schoolchildren and adults, the Tamil Nadu government may issue orders banning the sale of these items in all school and college canteens.Instead, the canteens may serve healthy traditional Indian food items, which contain less fat, sugar and salt.P.

Gomathinayagam,Tirunelveli.Risky rideEveryone knows that driving a two-wheeler in Nagercoil town requires more talent and an ability to take risks. If you have a chance of following a bus coming out of the Anna bus stand closely, suddenly a pothole will appear from nowhere and you should be smart enough to decide whether it is safe to allow the two-wheeler into the pothole or circumvent it, but only with the permission of the driver of the bus who closely follows you.The risk is more if you are followed by a minibus. There are many pits and potholes opposite the Anna bus stand. Some pits are more than a foot deep.As it is a junction, the two-wheeler rider will not give much attention to the approaching danger lying below than looking at the vehicles coming from both sides.W.D. Chitranand Arachi,Kanniyakumari.Escalator in stationAnd, finally, escalators in the first and second platforms of Tirunelveli Junction have come into operation.

Rajakumar Arulanandham,Palayamkottai.IIThe Nagercoil Junction became operational on April 15, 1979.But even now, there are many essential requirements to be addressed, to ensure a reasonable comfort for travellers. Boarding popular trains like Ananthapuri and Bengaluru Express from platform 2 or 3 causes a lot of agony for the elderly. The one escalator is virtually under lock and key forbidding its use by passengers. Even the Kanniyakumari station lacks the minimum required facilities.Be it in providing infrastructure or passenger amenities, Nagercoil Junction appears to be neglected by Tiruvananthapuram Division. Hence, the sections falling under Kanniyakumari and Tirunelveli districts should be transferred back to Madurai Division to improve efficiency.G. Stanley Jeyasingh,Nagercoil.Irregular busesTown buses are being operated to the southern-most coastal villages like Koottapuly and Perumanal from Nagercoil by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation. But, unfortunately, the buses are irregular and sometimes cancelled. This causes great inconvenience to the public. Particularly, the route 3F bus commences its first trip from Vivekandapuram depot around 3 p.m.From there it comes to Kootapuly to take passengers to Vadasery. But, most of the days, it directly goes to Vadasery from Anjugramam without touching Koottapuly. I request the transport authorities to take steps to operate 3F service regularly.S.J.

These farmers sow the cane even as its outsized water demands relative to other crops threaten to plunge this traditionally arid region back into a drought.""It is the only reliable crop. Earlier this year I cultivated onions and incurred a 50,000 rupees loss as prices crashed,"" said Wagh, who plants 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of sugar cane.Four months ago Maharashtra, the biggest sugar producing region in India, suffered the worst drought in four decades that ravaged crops, killed livestock, depleted reservoirs and slowed down hydroelectric power output.Environmental activists and the government blamed the rapid expansion of sugar cane growing for creating the water scarcity. Cane consumes about 22.5 million litres of water per hectare during its 14-month long growing cycle compared to just 4 million litres over four months for chickpeas, a pulse, commonly grown in India and called gram locally.Without government intervention to reset the revenue balance in favour of other crops, experts warn the sustained production of sugar cane will further deplete scarce water resources and leave the region prone to droughts. This could create social unrest stemming from the widening income gap between cane growers and other farmers.""The government asks farmers to shift to less water consuming crops, but it does little to support those crops. It failed to solve the problems of oilseed and pulses growers,"" said Pradeep Purandare, a former professor at Maharashtra Water and Land Management Institute based in Aurangabad.Erratic prices for vegetables, oilseeds and pulses limit the incentive for farmers to plant them.In contrast, the government requires sugar mills to buy cane at a set ""fair and remunerative price"" (FRP). The government also buys wheat and rice at what is called the minimum support price (MSP).""Returns from other crops are unpredictable. This year I allowed 5 tonnes of onions to rot. Prices were so low that my losses would have increased by transporting onions to the market,"" said Suresh Kothawale, another Aurangabad farmer.India's government hopes higher subsidies for pulses and oilseeds will change farming patterns.""We are creating oilseeds and pulses as an alternative for sugar cane by raising their minimum support prices,"" said a senior official at India's Agriculture Ministry who declined to be named.But industry critics said the pulse and oilseed MSP only exists on paper as the government never procures them aggressively like wheat or rice.""Green gram prices were trading below support prices due to higher production. This makes the support price irrelevant for farmers,"" said Nitin Kalantri, a pulses miller based at Latur in Maharashtra.HARDY CROP, POLITICAL CLOUTThe sugar mill buildup in Marathwada was initially pushed by politicians in the region trying to replicate the prosperity of mills in other areas of Maharashtra state and was focused on areas with plentiful water, said Jaidev Dole, a political analyst in Aurangabad.""But later politicians opened mills everywhere, even in areas where drinking water is not available, to build a constituency rather than making farmers rich,"" he said.Farmers sell cane directly to sugar mills, effectively getting 100 percent remuneration, but other crops pass through middlemen, ensuring farmers get half the price consumers pay, said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.Sugar cane's sturdiness also attracts farmers because of limited access to insurance that protects against crop failures.Mature cane withstands heavy rainfall or dry spells and is also less vulnerable to pest and diseases compared to other crops, said farmer Sharad Mate, who has lost pulse crops due to droughts and un-seasonal rainfall.""I had taken crop insurance for pulses last year, but didn't get compensation despite losing an entire crop,"" said Mate, a farmer from Sillod, northeast of Aurangabad."

This, many expect, would create more room for interest rate cuts."

According to the Prime Minister, black money holders can be checked through this. But look at the common man who has been checkmated. He is the one who is bearing the brunt.Many had raised eyebrows when I burnt Rs 23,000 to ashes. I had my reasons, he said.I was standing in queues outside banks to change the notes for three consecutive days. Then I had to be hospitalised, as I fainted from low blood sugar levels. Only after this did I decide to burn the notes. I am not against Modi. But I am against his policies which hit the common man, said Yahiya.According to Asharaf Kadakkal, Assistant Professor, Department of Islamic Studies, University of Kerala, who posted about Yahiyas novel protest on Facebook, as popular as the old man is for the delicious food he serves, he is considered an eccentric. He wears a night gown (maxi in local parlance) during business hours and talks candidly, often using derogatory remarks, over current issues and politics while serving steamy, spicy beef fry and chicken fry and other delicacies. Locals say Yahiya, who is staunchly against wastage of food, often ends up in war of words with customers over it. But no one who has tasted RMS thattukadas specials will never turn their back on him, he said.Its always a treat to the eyes and ears when he is at work. He is of a distinctive character because of his approach towards social issues. We were taken aback when he arrived in this new look, after he shaved the hair off one side of his head. When we asked about it, he said its a protest against demonetisation, and narrated how he turned Rs 23,000 of his earnings in old currency to ashes.Those who know Yahiya well know this is the way he deals with such issues, said Asharaf."

Although the state accounts for only 1.5 percent of Indias geographical area, over the past two decades it has contributed 35 percent of the nations rice production and 60 cent of its wheat.LOW RAINFALLAccording to Sunil Jain, regional director of the Central Ground Water Board for northwest India, groundwater started dropping in 1985 in Punjab, and has sunk to alarming levels in recent years.Thirty years ago farmers in most parts of the state could draw water at a depth of 10 metres (32 ft), but by 2015 this was 20 metres, while farmers in some central parts of the state are unable to find water even at 30 metres or deeper, he said.There has been a substantial rise in groundwater utilisation, which has mainly happened because of the fact that Punjab gets less rainfall. Since paddy (rice) requires a lot of water, the farmers resort to heavy usage of groundwater for irrigating the paddy fields, he said.Jain added that Punjab gets less than 700mm of rainfall annually. This compares to a national average of 1,083mm, according to the World Bank.Amit Kar, an economist at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, attributed the groundwater shortage to government policies such as free electricity for irrigation, credit facilities and subsidies for digging wells and buying pumping equipment, as well as heavily subsidised diesel fuel for pumps.The PAU report said annual demand for irrigation in Punjab is 4.76 million hectare metres (mhm) against a total annual supply of 3.48 mhm from canal and groundwater resources.The deficit is met by overexploitation of deeper groundwater by farmers using nearly 1.4 million tube wells, which exacerbates the loss of more accessible groundwater.According to the PAU report, 3.5 million of Punjabs 9.1 million workers make a living from agriculture or associated activities.Jain said the statistics suggest Punjabs agricultural success may not be sustainable.Punjabs exports of rice and wheat to other regions literally mean the export of its groundwater to those regions, he said.Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer of the government's National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), predicted the present rate of withdrawal will lead to complete exhaustion of groundwater within a decade in the region.Kant said India, already water-stressed, is rapidly moving towards becoming water-scarce.TIME TO SWITCH?Switching to new crops is one way to ease the problem in Punjab, said PAU's Aggarwal. Rice requires about four times as much water as maize, pulses or oilseeds, for instance.Vinod Kumar Singh, a scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, said Punjab must make the shift at any cost.The government has to make some policy decisions like assuring the farmers it will procure their produce other than paddy (rice) and wheat. Only then will they be convinced to switch over to these crops, he said.Under Indias state-sponsored Public Distribution System, the national government buys staple foods like rice, wheat and sugar from farmers and sells them to citizens at fair or cheaper prices. Commodities worth $2.25 billion, including rice and wheat, are sold annually to about 160 million families.Jasbir Singh Bains, Punjab's director of agriculture, said that system makes farmers reluctant to cultivate other crops.We have started making efforts to popularise the cultivation of pulses, maize, vegetables and oilseeds, Bains said. For example, we have appealed to the central government to increase the procurement of pulses and are urging the farmers to grow vegetables, which also have a good market.Farmers like Shamsher Singh, in NokdarJalandhar, said they would switch to less thirsty crops with government help.We are ready for this, but the government should give the guarantee that it will procure our products like it is doing in the case of wheat and rice, he said."

On a sequential basis, it was lower than August's 8.23 per cent rise.Nonetheless, the annual rate of inflation for some commodities remained rather high on a YoY basis: Potatoes (73.31 per cent), pulses (23.99 per cent) and fruits (14.10 per cent).The protein-based food items such as eggs, meat and fish became dearer by 7.44 per cent. Besides, wheat became expensive by 7.01 per cent.However, onion prices were down (-)70.52 per cent in September this year, against the like month of the previous year. Overall vegetables prices came down by (-)10.91 per cent.The expenses on primary articles which constitute 20.12 per cent of the WPI's total weight rose by 4.76 per cent.Prices of manufactured products, which comprise nearly 65 per cent of the index, continued to rise for the sixth straight month, rising by 2.48 per cent in September. The prices rose by 2.42 per cent in August.The sub-category of manufactured food products, which includes sugar and edible oils, registered a rise of 11.21 per cent.This was mainly caused by a spurt in sugar prices, which rose by 32.92 per cent, as a result of production shortages. The cost of edible oils rose by 5.87 per cent.On the other hand, fuel inflation accelerated in September. It edged up by 5.58 per cent as compared to a 1.62 per cent rise in August and (-)1.00 per cent in July.Diesel prices continued to rise after seeing an uptrend which started in June after many months of consecutive fall. Prices of high-speed diesel rose by 19.08 per cent last month.The gasoline or petrol prices inched up by 1.25 per cent, while the LPG cost declined by (-)1.30 per cent.The WPI data released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry also revealed the revised inflation figures for July. The final WPI-based inflation for ""All Commodities"" stood at 3.72 per cent as compared to 3.55 percent (provisional) which was released in August.The WPI figures comes a day after data on India's annual retail inflation showed a decline of 4.31 per cent from 5.05 per cent in August and 4.41 per cent reported during the corresponding period of last year.The CPI (Consumer Price Index) data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the fall in retail inflation was due to a rather sharp drop in the annual food inflation -- from 5.91 per cent in August to 3.88 per cent in September.The September annual retail inflation came below the upper tolerance level of six per cent for the second straight month, even though it is still above the base rate of four per cent.The government target is four per cent plus-or-minus two percentage points for the next five years."

Around 50 farmers participated.The farmers urged the national and regional political parties to support their cause, thereby persuading both the State and Central governments to act swiftly to prevent suicides and deaths of farmers due to crop failure.Due to monsoon failure, canal-based irrigation and drying up of borewells, the paddy cultivation in the district has taken a hit like elsewhere in delta. As our crops are withering, we need crop compensation immediately to safeguard the farmers who are frustrated as all their investments are going down the drain, Puliyur Nagarajan, State president of Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) farmers wing, told Express.Much like paddy, cash crops such as banana, sugar cane and betel leaf were severely hit with inadequate sources of irrigation. They sought `30,000 to `50,000 as compensation per acre, according to the type of cash crop.Regardless of the size of cultivation, all farmers should be supported by the government to prevent further deaths in the farming community. Crop loans of farmers should be waived with immediate effect, Nagarajan added.While raising their demands, the farmers in and around Vayalur also conveyed their displeasure over silence of governments in declaring the State drought-hit and sought immediate relief measures."

However, collectively the party does not appear to have learnt any lessons to stand united.Maharashtra is a textbook example of the working of the Congress system at the state level. The party has occupied the ruling space in Maharashtra for most of the past 60 plus years. Between 2004 and 2014 it had to share the space with Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Though both the parties maintained a good working relationship in running the government for 10 year, their rule was riddled with corruption.The party that won over 200 seats (out of 288) in the assembly several times in past has been struggling to get to three digits since 1990. The NCPs entry in the political arena in 1999 shrank them further. In 2009 most of the Congress leaders wanted to sever ties with the NCP before the Assembly elections hoping to win more than 100 seats. However, that did not happen and the Congress won 82 seats. In 2014, the tally slid further to 42, the partys worst performance in the state.The Congress has been completely uprooted from Vidarbha, North Maharashtra and Marathwada. In Konkan, Narayan Rane  who was a chief minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government in 1998  is the face-saver for the Congress, while it faces a tough challenge from its ally, the NCP, in western Maharashtra, its erstwhile bastion. The party apparatus had withered and workers were left demoralized after the devastating defeat in 2014. The first sign of the partys revival came early this year when it won the maximum number of seats in rural local body elections. However, at the same time the party couldnt do much in the corporation polls in Navi Mumbai and Aurangabad, underlining the fact that its hopes lie in the rural area, its traditional base.The Congress partys state president Ashok Chavans efforts to revive the party have obvious limitations due to the Adarsh housing scam case. Ranes entry into the state legislature during the monsoon session earlier this year created a stir. But in the past few days, his name too is being taken in a case that the Enforcement Directorate is said to be investigating. Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan is another leader who has the vision to revive the party in the state. But he lacks a mass following and has little support amongst state leaders. The party survives in pockets where leaders have a good connect with the people. But they lack statewide appeal.The BJP government in the state had been systematically targeting the cooperative sector  the APMCs, the credit societies, sugar mills and cooperative banks. Its success in this endeavour would be the biggest threat to the Congress."

The soft drinks industry opposes such taxes.Despite its name, PepsiCo generates only 12 percent of its $63 billion in annual revenue from its famous cola brand. It makes 25 percent from carbonated soft drinks such as Mountain Dew, with the rest coming from waters and juices including the Tropicana brand, plus snacks and dips such as hummus and guacamole.Its 2025 goals also include targets for lowering sodium and saturated fat.FINANCIAL PROGRESS""These are good steps.

He added that, over the past decade, average returns on investments in this area have been better than the cost of capital.Khan expects similar returns in future, which might be good news for investors, who generally don't base investment decisions on sustainability.""It might not be the driving factor, but it might a filter,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.Other targets include a 15 percent improvement in the water efficiency of PepsiCo's direct agricultural supply chain in water-stressed areas by 2025 and a 20 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2030."

The money was transferred in July this year under a Letter of Credit (LoC) to the account of Elamakkara-native Jose George, owner of the exporting company, at the Wellington Island branch of SBI. The company, Trade International, has been operating with valid licence. After a few days of the transfer, Jose George withdrew `30 crore from the account, and deposited it in the accounts of his relatives.When the Customs Department scrutinised the documents submitted by Jose George, showing details of the goods shipped to Bulgarian firm Zevzda, it was found that no commodity was exported against the LoC. Since the money was withdrawn using the LoC even before exporting goods, the Customs Department referred the case to the Enforcement Directorate.So far, Trade International has been engaged only in export of sunflower oil to Iraq. The company received an order from Zevzda for exporting sunflower oil and sugar in May this year. The order was so big that it would be impossible for the company to carry out the export with its existing infrastructure. While the LoC is usually encashed only after completion of the shipping process, in the case under reference, no shipping took place, said an ED official.Examination of the documents submitted by Trade International showed that forged seal of the Customs was used on some of them. Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate has frozen the account to which the money was transferred, and the accounts held by Jose Georges relatives. Though the ED tried to communicate with the authorities of Zevzda, they refused to cooperate with the investigation agency.Trade International is operating from a rented apartment near Jose Georges residence in the same building. When we conducted an inspection, there were only a few employees at the office whose main job was to send emails. We have recorded the statements of Jose George, an NRI who returned to Kerala a few years ago, and his relatives, added the official.Speaking to mediapersons, Jose George dismissed the allegations and claimed that he was not involved in any fictitious deal. He said that the money transferred to his account was legitimate, and that some vested interests were attempting to trap him."

A central bank auction of dollars will be held later Thursday, allowing supply and demand to determine the value of the pound for the first time in decades.The devaluation was virtually certain to cause a steep hike in prices, piling up pressure on President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's government to avoid a popular backlash against its handling of the economy. El-Sissi has repeatedly urged Egyptians in recent weeks to rally behind him as he grapples with the country's worst economic crisis in decades.The much heralded decision by the Egyptian Central Bank followed a sharp and sudden decline this week in the value of the dollar on the unofficial market, plunging from an all-time high of 18.25 pounds to around 13 to the U.S. currency.The IMF's executive board has yet to ratify the $12 billion loan provisionally agreed by Egypt and the lender-of-last-resort in August.Egypt is also facing another painful must  it's expected to reduce or lift altogether state subsidies on fuel to meet IMF conditions.

It announced that the price would be same as last season - Rs2,300, said P Govindaraj of Tholagirippatti village, the secretary of Arignar Anna Sugar Mills Sugarcane Farmers Association. The state government announced the same State Advisory Price (SAP) of Rs2,850, including the transportation cost of Rs100. The sugarcane farmers have no benefit with this announcement, he added.According to the way the business functions, the private mills pay only the FRP (Rs2,300), with only the cooperative and public sector sugar mills paying the SAP (Rs2,850).

The State has taken this stand despite the repeated demand by farmers to fix a higher price for sugarcane.The procurement price would include the fixed remunerative price (FRP) of Rs2,300 announced recently by the Centre, and the State Advisory Price (SAP) of Rs550 which includes Rs100 for transportation charges.However, the Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said that a panel, comprising of senior officials of the State, representatives of farmers and sugar mills, would be formed to suggest to the Government a sugarcane price which would be remunerative to farmers and facilitate an appropriate share in the profit netted by the sugar mills.This decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by OPS on Monday. In a statement here, OPS said the Central government had not hiked its FRP for sugarcane for the current crushing season. Further in neighbouring Karnataka, a majority of sugar mills were giving only Rs2,600 per tonne while many mills in Maharashtra were paying less - Rs2,475 a tonne.He also recalled that whenever the Centre hiked the sugarcane price, the State government fixed a higher State Advisory Price for sugarcane, keeping in mind the farmers welfare.To maximise the sugarcane production in the State, the Government is implementing various technologies such as sustainable sugarcane initiative, drip fertigation etc, Panneerselvam said, adding that he had directed officials to implement these measures fully.Meanwhile, in a statement here, the PMK founder S Ramadoss said the refusal to hike the sugarcane procurement price had betrayed the farmers in Tamil Nadu. While Uttar Pradesh government had fixed an SAP at Rs3,050, Haryana and Punjab too have announced a higher price for sugarcane. He said the Tamil Nadu should increase the SAP to Rs4,000 a tonne and to take immediate steps for payment of Rs1,659 crore dues from the sugar mills to farmers.Expressing shock, D Ravindran, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, said the meagre procurement price had come at a time when farmers were expecting at least Rs4,000 a tonne. The members of the association would protest in front of sugar mills from January 3, demanding Rs4,000 a tonne as well as immediate disbursal of dues from the sugar mills, he added."

The World Heart Federation motivates health care professionals, medical societies, policy makers, patients, organizations and other healthy individuals to come forward and participate actively in the campaign to reduce the fear of heart disease and stroke.World Heart Day is an effective way established by the World Heart Federation to make people aware that heart ailments are the leading cause of death. This is the day where people make promises of either quit smoking, get involved in daily physical activities or start eating healthy diet. The main aim of World Heart Day is to improve global heart health by encouraging people to make lifestyle changes. WHO reduce non-communicable disease mortality rate by 2025 by reducing premature deaths because of cardiovascular disease.CVDs are the number 1 cause of death globally. An estimated 17.5 million people died from CVDs in 2012, representing 31 per cent of all global deaths. In the South-East Asia Region cardiovascular diseases including coronary heart disease and stroke cause an estimated 3.7 million deaths or a quarter of all deaths annually in the region (2.0 million among males and 1.7 million among females). 38 per cent of all deaths due to cardiovascular diseases in the region occur before the age of 70 years.Tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

The Finance Minister promised to continue the governments policy push to boost economic activities and investment flows into India.Jaitley also pointed out that the domestic reforms would neutralise any adverse impact of the global slowdown.Over the last two-and-a-half years most of the sectors have been reviewed and we now have, probably, the most open FDI policy in the world  with 90 per cent of FDI coming in through the automatic route, he said.Jaitley reiterated that the ease of doing business in India has improved significantly under the NDA government and added that many policy changes in the recent past have added steadily to making processes easier to deal with.Jaitley also applauded the states for their competitive spirit in making themselves business-friendly.Cabinet nod to EXIM Bank, NDB pactThe Union Cabinet on Thursday approved an agreement between the Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) and BRICS-promoted New Development Bank (NDB), and other development financial institutions of member nations.

Oil companies have to necessarily blend up to 10 per cent of ethanol in petrol. The price of ethanol will now be determined on the basis of prevalent price of sugar in the open market, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. Any pricing mechanism should be market driven and we are moving towards that in case of ethanol as well, he said. The NDA-government had in December 2014 fixed a price of H48.50-49.50 per litre for procurement of ethanol. The rate paid to sugar mills was never H48.50 but H42."

Blending of ethanol with petrol will lower the requirement for crude oil, which accounts for the largest foreign exchange expenditure for India. The strategy also has the potential to help farmers when there is a sugarcane oversupply. We want to link the price to market dynamics. Government will move towards market dynamic pricing system, Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.At present, the government fixes the price of ethanol and has permitted state run oil marketing companies to sell ethanol blended petrol ethanol percentage up to 10 percent.

Balasubramanian, the CEO of the Hyderabad-based Sresta Natural Bio Products Ltd, which owns the '24 Mantra Organic' food brand, was travelling in a cab in New Delhi. He got talking to the driver about organic food. When the driver asked him the name of the brand, Balasubramanian said, 24 Mantra Organic.The driver shocked the CEO when he said, That is what I use. The atta (wheat) is very good. It is Rs 52 a kg, and it costs me Rs 500 a month, but I don't mind. My family enjoys good quality rotis, which I used to eat as a child.At the Lulu Mall, on a recent visit, to Kochi, Balasubramanian says, I have never forgotten that conversation. Meanwhile, as he is speaking, at the Hyper Market, where the company has a section, Radha Menon (name changed) takes a 5 kg bag of wheat. I have been using this for two years, she says. The quality is very good. Balasubramanian smiles when he hears this.The USP of the company is that, with the help of 32,000 farmers, it makes its own food, pesticide-free, in an area of 1.7 lakh acres, across 16 states. We encourage the farmers to use cow dung and other natural fertilisers, says Balasubramanian. In place of pesticides, we encourage them to use neem, ginger and cow urine. Essentially, we are using traditional methods in a scientific manner.The company goes to areas where particular crops grow well. So, they grow ginger in Sikkim, gram in Maharashtra, jaggery and sugar in Karnataka and Uttarakhand, chillies (Andhra Pradesh), peanut (Karnataka), apart from black pepper, cardamon and spices in Kerala.Meanwhile, the company is very particular in the way they store the produce. We have developed our own indigenous methods, says Balasubramanian. At the storehouse, we just remove the oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, no insect or larva can breathe. We do this for 15 days, till the larva cycle ends. Thereafter, we put the products in a pack and seal it.Following this, it is checked by any one of the 14 international agencies which are accredited with the government of India. Thereafter, it is sold through 250 outlets in departmental stores and malls. Asked why they don't have their own stores, Balasubramanian says, We are already doing farming, processing, packaging and marketing. It would be too much to run stores, too. In Kochi, you can get their products at Sunrise City, Panampally Nagar, SR Organics, Tripunithara, and Bismi Supermarket, Kaloor, among other places.But Balasubramanian is honest enough to admit that the products are on the expensive side. Fora family of four, you will be buying Rs 4000 worth of food products every month, he says. But when you switch to '24 Mantra Organic', it will go up by Rs 1500. But this is just the cost of a movie outing at a multiplex for a family.And it may be safer to pay more and have organic food, so that you can avoid dangerous diseases like cancer. Anybody I meet I ask this question: do you know of anybody who has cancer? And the answer is always yes, says Balasubramanian. Cancer from pesticide-laden food happens over several years, and not in a short time of, say, five years.Finally, when asked about the meaning of the word, '24 Mantra Organic', Balasubramanian says, It stands for a Sanskrit slogan: 'Bhumir Apo Analo Anilo Nabha' - 'You alone are the Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether'. When you write it in English there are 24 letters."

This was the fifth straight month of WPI inflation after continued deflation for over a year.In first week of September, retail price inflation remained lower at 5.05 percent that had declined from 6.07 per cent in July, below the tolerance level of the government.Despite food inflation in both the indices showing signs of decline, both indices showed opposite trend. This was because the food index has lower weightage of over 14 percent in WPI against over 45 percent in CPI.This will bring a challenge for the new RBI Governor Urjit Patel for any monetary policy tweaking in October. However, the fact that WPI inflation is still 4 percent would give some comforts to the RBI in case it wants to cut the policy rate to spur economic growth.Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ICRA said that the WPI will have a limited impact on RBIs repo rate cut decision but we expect at least one 25 basis points rate cut this year. A rate cut is more likely to happen in December rather than October, she added.According to global financial services major DBS, the softening trend in inflation leaves the door open for a rate cut in the fourth quarter of this calender year with odds of a move in October on the rise.A benign inflation path going forward and likelihood of a dovish policy committee leaves the door open for further easing but this needs to be balanced off with firmer demand dynamics and risks of US rate normalisation as the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting approaches, DBS said in a research note.Commenting on the inflation number, D S Rawat, secretary general of Assocham said,  prices of products which are of national interest has been continuously rising at industry level are pulses, potato, and fibres but recent concern is sugar which has started to rise at much higher rate which policy makers should check though prices of onions have been managed."

This is the slowest rate at which retail inflation has grown in 14 months, having grown at 4.39 per cent in September helped by small rises in food prices.Making calls for a rate cut shriller, wholesale inflation also slowed down significantly in October, only growing by 3.39 per cent.The easing in CPI data is in line with the RBIs forecast for an average of 5 percent inflation for this financial year.The CPI saw the biggest slowdown in the vegetables category, which continued in the negative zone at (-)5.74 per cent as against (-)7.21 percent in the previous month of September. Sugar and confectionery, however, became dearer by 23.62 per cent.Pulses inflation numbers come as a respite to consumers who have battled high costs, slowing down to 4.11 per cent against 14.33 per cent. However, eggs became more expensive by 9.4 per cent.The index for fuel and light segment stood at 2.81 per cent in October as against 3.07 per cent a month ago.Wholesale price inflation, meanwhile, slowed for the second consecutive month at 3.39 per cent, again pushed by a decline in vegetable prices, which till July had scaled a high of 28.45 per cent.Easing inflation has prompetd industry representatives to demand a further reduction in interest rates to support investor as well as consumer sentiment.An immediate 50 basis points cut in repo rate should be considered by RBI as well as some measures, which may be introduced to provide easy finance for sectors like housing, automobiles and consumer durables, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry President Harshavardhan Neotia said.As per data on the wholesale price index released by the Commerce and Industry Ministry, prices of pulses and potato ruled high this year. The annual inflation rate for potatoes stood at a whopping 60.58 percent, while that for pulses stood at 21.8 per cent. The index for manufactured articles stood at 2.67 per cent in October compared to 2.48 percent in the previous month."

We will be able to complete the entire 2 million tonnes by June 2017, Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande said on the sidelines of FICCI conference on food service industry.Pulses production is estimated to increase to more than 20 million tonnes in 2016-17. So, we will be able to procure one million tonne of pulses from domestic market for buffer stock and rest one million tonnes will be imported, he said.India has imported 3.5 million tonnes of pulses so far this fiscal, out of which 0.4 million tonnes is by public sector trading agencies In an initiative to safeguard the interest of buyers, the government is also coming up with a new Consumer Protection Act which is scheduled to be introduced in Parliament soon.Ensuring the availability of 24-25 million tonnes of pulses, the Ministry expects a reduction in imports as they expect a significant rise in production. Last fiscal, India imported nearly six million tonnes of pulses to meet the domestic demand.The price of pulses which had skyrocketed to `200 per kg, have seen a steep correction while the price of sugar is stable.Meanwhile, the wastage of tomatoes produced, makes it imperative that other fruits and vegetables are safeguarded from this wastage. Hence, the need to reduce post-harvest crop-loss and wastage of cooked food is also being emphasized with the need to increase the processing level of fruits and vegetables to 20 per cent in a attempt to reduce post harvest losses."

It was a small restaurant but the experience taught me a lot. The city has also gradually changed from being a quite place known for its greenery to an IT hub and we were exposed to cuisines from all over the world. I was lucky enough to be trained under the best Italian and French chefs. I have worked in this city for a few years now and have had several competitions with my colleagues to bring out the best dish during the food trials in various restaurants.The dish that I am sharing today came to my mind during one of the food trials. Red bell pepper was often used by many departments in the kitchen to either make a salsa dip or salsa salad. I was always fascinated by the flavour you get after barbecuing red bell peppers. After that I always wanted to make a burnt barbecued red bell pepper sauce with Indian spices.After preparing the sauce I tried adding it to different types of cuisines and dishes but the one that stood out was a burnt bell pepper chilli Margherita pizza. The way the cooked pepper and cheese played with your palate was perfectly balanced and almost felt like they belonged together.Red Bell Pepper Sauce IngredientsRed Bell pepper -.500 Gm  Oregano- 10 GmCumin Powder - 5 Gm  Fresh Red Chili - 5 gmSalt - 5 Gm  Coriander Powder - 5 GmOnion -10 Gm  Garlic - 5 GmOlive Oil-15 Gm  Water-50 MlDirections1. Heat oven to 200C/180C. Place the peppers and Red chilli on a baking tray and roast in the oven for about 45 mins until the skins are blackened. Remove from the oven and putinto a plastic bag - this makes them sweat and the skins slip off more easily. When cool enough to handle, peel off the skins with your fingers. Slice the peppers open, pick outand discard all the seeds and membrane, then roughly chop the red flesh.2. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. When hot, fry the garlic and shallot for a few mins. Add the chopped peppers, Cumin Powder, Coriander Powder, and continue to fry for a few mins, stirring to combine everything. Add the Water, bring to the boil, then allow it to reduce a little.3. Pour the contents of the pan into a blender and whizz until smooth. Adjust the seasoning to taste. Depending on the ripeness of the peppers, you shouldnt need any sugar - but if they retain a slightly bitter flavor, return the sauce to the pan, add sugar to taste and let it dissolve over the heat"

What does that mean? Everyone means how many? S.I.-sir asked as if he were conducting a cross-examination. Sir, we have a hundred and twenty-three students, Dinamastres voice was trembling. But your attendance registers say only sixty-three students are present today, said the S.I. getting irritated. He had a blackberry-sized wart between his lip and chin. Perhaps it was due to the weight of his wart that his lower lip drooped. Eating away poor childrens food? Is it your dharma? Who will forgive you? The entry in the attendance register is sixty-three but the stock register says one hundred and twenty-three. Are you fooling me? Thieving  robbery you are teaching this to students? Who really appointed you as a teacher?... Go and beat a drum, S.I.-sir went on rebuking him.This time too Dinamastre wanted to say something but could not. His eyes became moist and his nose started to run. In his thirty years of service, no one had ever pointed a finger at him and had called him a thief or a robber. For the first time, such words had been flung at him when he was innocent of any crime.It was true that sixty-three students had come to school today. It was also true that the stock register said one hundred and twenty-three students. But dalia for only sixty-three students had been given to the cook Raghuama to prepare. This did not mean that he, Dinamastre, was stealing the food meant for the children. He was not a thief. The truth was that in order to feed the poor children the government threw a few sacks of dalia. But to cook that dalia from where could the fuel be collected? Would the children fetch the wood missing their classes? Did the government supply the little gur or sugar that was added to the dalia or the fried chillies and onions that were sometimes mixed into the dalia? If he did not sell dalia, was he to buy these things from his own pocket? To get some money, Dinamastre sold as much dalia as was needed to buy the required fuel, gur, oil, onions, chillies, and so on.Dinamastres anger rose; he was about to break down. He thought of using a few rough words to teach S.I. Panda a lesson, but he did not. He was compelled to remain silent because he knew how Makarand, the school teacher, after retiring from Kenduguda School had been suffering. That helpless old man, otherwise gentle, had been running to the block office every week. His pension papers had not been prepared because, it seems, he had once shouted at a certain S.I. or D.I. on some official matter.(Excerpted from Bheda by Akhila Naik; Translated from Odiya by Raj Kumar; Publisher: Oxford University Press (forthcoming))"

We have been forced to downsize production,"" Haldar added.Dhiman Das of sweet giants KC Das -- which is regarded as the inventor of the rosogolla -- revealed they had to stall production for a day due to the dip in demand.""Our sales had gone down by 30 per cent and we had to stop production for a day as stocks were enough to satisfy the low footfall. The sale of rosogollas have always been very high. That seems to have taken a beating along with our platter of sandesh (sweetmeat made of cottage cheese),"" Das told IANS.The premier retailer, which has outlets in Esplanade, Rashbehari Avenue, Jodhpur Park, Lake Town and Shyambazar, besides also catering to the south Indian belt in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, has the option of card swiping which has somewhat bailed it out for now.""Payment by credit cards has helped normalise sales after the 10th of this month and thankfully the house is now in order. The credit cards sales have increased by 241 per cent,"" he informed.The not-so-lucky kin of the big boys are on the brink of falling by the wayside with 86 per cent of India's currency no longer valid.""Our business has been halved after the currency ban. Rosogollas (sales) for sure, but overall as well,"" said Swaraj Pal, owner of Kamala Mistanna Bhandar, a popular sweets joint at Netaji Nagar.""We are selling sweets without taking payment to those whom we know in the hope that they will pay us later. We have to do that as most people who come to buy sweets are saying they don't have enough currency.""Pal also spilled the beans on the common trend of accepting now illegal Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes if a customer is buying goods close to the denomination.""Yes we are doing that with people we know because it's better than facing loss. We can exchange the currency later as there is still time.""Pal, though, lauded the initiative. ""I would not say it's a bad move. Black money will be curbed. We are facing initial hiccups but that's ok,"" Pal said.Shree Durga Sweets, a famous outlet in South Kolkata's Bhowanipore, also painted a grim picture. ""We have rosogollas worth Rs 5 and Rs 10 which are heavily in demand throughout the year. During the time of Kartik Puja (which was celebrated on Thursday this year) we usually enjoy good profit. The scenario this year is obviously different.""Most customers are still coming with Rs 500 notes and those who want to have the rosogollas are reluctant to spend Rs 100 from their pocket as that denomination has suddenly become precious. We don't accept cards. So that's a drawback,"" a senior staffer said.""We are struggling to pay our employees and the raw material suppliers. The entire dealing is in cash and we are now in a mess,"" he added."

When the blood sugar level is more than 200mg per decilitre consistently for five years, a peripheral neuropathy (weakness, numbness and pain from nerve damage, usually in the hands and feet) is a possibility. Diabetic foot ulcers are common in such patients.While surgical debridement (cleaning dead tissue in a wound) is done commonly, lesser known maggot therapy is an option. Maggot therapy is a type of biotherapy that involves applying live, disinfected maggots on soft tissue wounds. The larvae eat necrotic/dead tissue in the wound and disinfect it. The thought of creepy crawlies in your limb may be unacceptable but it has shown successful results. Charaka Samhita, an ancient Sanskrit text that is one of the foundational texts for Ayurveda in India, mentions maggot therapy.In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of maggots as medical device. Dr BR Srinivas, a diabetologist who runs City Healthcare Hospital in Kolar, has been treating diabetics for more than a decade now. One cannot believe the kind of diabetic foot ulcers you get to see in rural areas. They are unaware of the necrotic/dead tissue. Since there is no sensation they step on foreign objects and are not aware of it. Once I found three stapler pins embedded in a patients foot, he said.Appalled by the number of patients coming with diabetic foot ulcers where the amount of dead tissue to be removed was a lot and non-healing, he turned to Charaka Samhita for a solution and treated five patients with favourable results. Now he has written to the director of AYUSH in Karnataka requesting him to use the therapy in AYUSH hospitals in the state.AYUSH director Raj Kishore Singh said that a protocol had to be developed before using it. He has also written to the Drug Controller General of India to recognise maggots as a medical device.Dr Sanjay Reddy, consultant diabetologist, Fortis hospital, Cunningham Road, said, It is rare in Indian hospitals because we are not sure where ulcer grade maggots are available. I do not have first-hand experience of working with it but even a physician can administer it. In UK, there are medical-grade maggots that are approved and are used commercially. Its been there for ages. It costs 20-30 pounds in the UK. Its legal, its available all across the world.On the aspect of legality, Indian laws are silent on maggot therapy. If one is using a new form of therapy, they should take the local ethics committee permission giving evidence for the procedure and then go ahead. But maggots therapy are not patented or anything, and neither is it a new drug or device or biological substance or biotechnology, Reddy added.Dr R Balaji, HOD, Plastic Surgery, Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences, has been treating diabetic foot for the past 25 years. Id rather use surgical debridement than maggots because the latter is time consuming. Also, culture maggots are available only in Mumbai, he said."

58fd481e7be9e06c93718a92,Sugarcane glut kills hopes of farmers,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2016/aug/28/Sugarcane-glut-kills-hopes-of-farmers-1513710.html,2016-08-28,"THANJAVUR: By all accounts, it was a bumper sugarcane harvest last season for S Pitchaiyan from Kurungulum in Thanjavur. His 18-acre field yielded 870 tonnes. But that did not help much as the sugarcane glut drastically brought the price down.Thus, even before he could celebrate a good season, Pitchaiyan and his wife were into calculating the money they need for household expenses, including the school fees for his two children whom he had just admitted to top private schools, and the money that they raised by loan and by borrowing from others.There are thousands of farmers in Tamil Nadu in a similar situation after the sugar mills refused to pay the State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 2,850 per tonne fixed by the State government. In fact, in most cases, those like Pitchaiyan have not even received the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs 2,300 per tonne fixed by the Centre.The State-owned Arignar Anna Sugar Mills (AASM), which used to pay him the SAP in the previous years, paid him only Rs 2,000 per tonne. Even that took time coming, he said, alleging that the payment for the cane supplied in December-January reached him only in March-April. I was forced to borrow Rs 5 lakh as loan at an interest rate of 36 per cent per year to meet household expenses, he said.Factoring in the Rs 100 per tonne deducted as transportation charge, the mill owes him Rs 6.52 lakh as arrears as per the SAP. Little wonder then that he is not interested in pruning the standing crop, which requires additional expenditure.If the authorities fail to take an effective action to redress the situation, I have no choice but to return to crops such as cashew. Return, because the field that now has sugarcane was once a cashew grove, before being converted about 15 years ago. That was when the crop had an assured market with mills entering into agreement to purchase the registered cane, and also arranged tie-up loans with banks.But all that is in the past. Their leaders claimed that the mills owe about Rs 150 crore to the farmers in the delta districts alone in the last two years. In the recent days, there have been several instances of sugarcane farmers turning to agitations seeking the money that is due to them from the mills.The impact of this strife is evident on the ground, where the area under cultivation has come down drastically over the years. Compared to 2011-12, it has been reduced by 87,000 hectares due to water shortage and farmers turning to other crops, said mill industry sources.In Thanjavur, for instance, the normal area of sugarcane has been 11,000 hectares. This year, however, only 4,984 hectares has come under cultivation so far. It would not exceed 6,000 hectares, said an official from the Agriculture Department.K Mohan of Thiruvaigavoor is one such case. Three years ago, he cultivated sugarcane in five acres, which was supplied to a private mill in Thirumandankudi. It now is a meagre 0.2 acre. Just a patch.For the last three years, the South Indian Sugar Mills Association has been refusing to pay the SAP of Rs 2,850, he reasoned his decision to reduce the area of sugarcane cultivation so drastically.The FRP amount was realised only after 15 months. For an average farmer, this means he cannot begin the next crop. I had to borrow Rs 1.5 lakh to admit my son to an engineering college, Mohan said.He has turned to black gram and paddy, and is now preparing for the Samba crop - that is now under serious risk due to Karnatakas refusal to release water.Like Pitchaiyan who spent over Rs 10 lakh to set up the drip irrigation system, many farmers had turned to technology while taking up sugarcane cultivation under the Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative (SSI) to increase productivity. This has now become a liability for them.Farmer A Sarafoji, of Pullaboothankudi, has been cultivating sugarcane for long and had some good years initially  as much as 200 tonnes from five-acres. This yield came down after rodents cut the pipes (a widespread problem, said an official), before the vagaries in price made him switch to paddy. The drip irrigation system is obsolescent for all other crops they take up.Those brave enough to continue, like Ramasamy of Minnathur, complained of depletion of groundwater and limited hours of power supply. He is now standing witness to his crops wilting.According to an official from the Agriculture Department, farmers are fast losing interest in this long-term crop due to mills not paying the SAP. With the cultivation cost hovering around Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 per acre, the return has been woefully inadequate to meet the family expenses, he said. They are now taking up paddy, pulses and horticultural crops instead of sugarcane, the official added.Now, it is the tie-up loan arrangement that is holding the remaining farmers back, as the assured market gives them a semblance of comfort when faced with the challenge of repayment.The sugar mills, on the other hand, maintained that the last few years have been tough days even for them, many a time forcing them to sell the produce at a rate lesser than the production cost. The market price was Rs 19-20, whereas our production cost was Rs 34, said an official from a mill in Thanjavur.The industry has been afflicted by a glut in the last year or so, incidentally brought about by the crude oil price crash. Brazil, the biggest producer and exporter of sugar, used to produce ethanol from the cane when the crude price was high. But after the price fell steeply, they have returned to produce sugar that flooded the international market, the official added. Due to the low international price, we could not export, the official said.The situation has now improved with market price hovering around Rs 30 per kg, said industry insiders. However, due to the heavy losses accumulated over the last five years, the mills are not in a position to pay the SAP, they claimed.The authorities are also regulating the sale of extra neutral alcohol, and the proposal to blend 10 per cent ethanol with petroleum products has not taken off."

Between April and September this year, the state has witnessed 320 farmer suicides.The number of farmer suicides in the current financial year has already surpassed the record of 2014-15. Mysuru and Mandya, mainly dependent on Cauvery river, reported 14 per cent of the total farmer suicides reported in the state since 2014, with 275 deaths.Government officials say crop loss, drought and pressure from private money lenders are the main reasons. A majority of the farmers who committed suicide in the sugarcane belt of Mandya and Mysuru is also because of the fall in sugar prices, they add.But what is worrying is the continuous unfavourable orders from the Supreme Court on the Cauvery dispute and the prevailing drought condition in several districts of Karnataka. These two factors may further affect the farmers.Karnataka has already announced drought in 68 taluks in its 22 districts because of the second successive drought year and sixth consecutive year of deficient rainfall.When contacted, Commissioner for Agriculture Pandurang Nayak said farmers in Cauvery basin districts are the worst affected because of the inter-state water dispute. We are trying our best to prevent farmers suicides through various government schemes, he said.Schemes not reaching beneficiariesState Sugarcane Growers Association president Kurbur Shanthakumar said most government schemes meant for farmers were not reaching the actual beneficiaries. We have been suffering because of severe water shortage and our crops have been destroyed because of drought. But the government has not done anything to protect farmers interests. The number of farmer suicides may further increase because of lack of support from the government and also the Supreme Court order to release more water to Tamil Nadu, he said.High compensation also triggering suicidesIts difficult for farmers to get crop loans from nationalised banks. Hence, many of them are forced to borrow from private lenders at huge interest rates for various expenses and then are unable to repay. The increased compensation for bereaved families of farmers is also forcing many to resort to such acts, said a senior official in the Agriculture Department.We have started several schemes including medical care and crop insurance for farmers. We have also launched a crackdown on illegal private moneylenders under the Karnataka Moneylenders Act, Karnataka Pawn Brokers Act, Chit Fund Act and Karnataka Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act. We are also counselling farmers not to use suicide as the last resort, he adds."

While Type 1 diabetes is largely found in the young, Type 2 diabetes is highly prevalent in adults and the elderly. In Type 2 diabetes, the blood sugar levels are high because the insulin produced by the pancreas is not used by the cells properly. One of the main causes of Type 2 diabetes is increased body weight. Consequently, regular exercise plays a key role in managing diabetes in older people.Through daily exercises, older people can improve their glucose levels and increase insulin sensitivity. One can effectively lose the extra weight and lower the blood sugar levels. But remember, the older you get, the more careful you need to be while physically exerting yourself.WalkingWalking is one of the most popular and beneficial forms of exercise for diabetics because it can be done anywhere and is inexpensive. Carrying out aerobic activities such as walking, for 30 minutes a day, help in increasing your heart rate. Make sure you choose a pair of comfortable shoes. Start slowly. At the beginning, set a short target and increase the distance and speed gradually. Dont stick to a monotonous routine. Mix it up by change the location on a regular basis in order to keep things interesting.YogaPractising yoga can ensure healthy pancreatic functioning. As you perform asanas that are directed at the alternate contraction and relaxation of muscles, especially in the abdomen, the supply of oxygenated blood to the pancreas is boosted. This revitalizes the functioning of the pancreas and increases its insulin producing abilities. Furthermore, yoga helps in simultaneously reducing body fat while also reducing stress levels.Tai ChiTai Chi is an enjoyable and gentle form of exercise that stimulates mental relaxation. A lot of people with diabetes have to deal with peripheral neuropathy, which can be seen is how a patient loses balance. The slow and relaxed movements of Tai Chi can improve your balance and works towards reducing nerve damage as well.SwimmingSwimming can be a great form of exercise for the elderly as it stretches out the body without exerting any pressure on the joints. Old age results in vulnerability of the bones and joint aches as well. Thus, swimming can give you the necessary exercise without being a burden later on. Through swimming one can reduce cholesterol levels, bring down stress and burn calories. In order to get the most from it, swim thrice a week for at least 10 minutes.Strength trainingStrength training refers to working on your muscles by using weights. Building muscle mass is essential for those with Type 2 diabetes. With increased muscle mass, you can easily maintain your blood sugar levels. For older people, it is vital to start small. Doing 10 repetitions of bicep curls can be a boon for you.Set attainable goals each day and gradually increase your workout. Remember, whatever form of exercise you pick, make sure you enjoy it.Consultant Diabetologist and Endocrinologist Fortis Hospital, Cunningham Road"

All the 17 channels of Cauvery should be released with adequate quantum of water for at least 5,000 cusecs from Mettur dam to safeguard the standing cash crops.Farmers irrespective of the farming associations and their affinity towards political outfits have sought the Union Government to intervene in the Cauvery water sharing dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka at the earliest to ensure at least the samba cultivation goes as planned in lakhs of acres across the delta districts with the Kuruvai given a miss for past five years.As per the final awards of Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal (CWDT), for the months between June and August, Karnataka government should have discharged as much as 94 tmc of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu but nothing like that sort has happened. As hostility mounts between two States, the Centre remain as mute spectator of the troubled events, said Siva Suriyan, district secretary of TN Vivasayigal Sangam.Apparently, raising slogans against the Karnataka and Union governments, and also seeking Cauvery Management Board to be constituted, the farmers laid a siege with withered crops to d Collector K S Palanisamy.Meanwhile in a bid to pacify the farmers, as agriculture department officials said that government would introduce special samba package scheme for `103 lakh to promote samba cultivation in Tiruchy under direct sowing method, farmers replied that direct sowing would be incompatible to the district instead had sought the State government to send delegates comprising all the MP from here to meet the Prime Minister installing Cauvery Management Board."

The police found that the arrested persons used to travel to Kashmir by flight and procure MDMA from there.The police have identified a Palluruthy-native as the main supplier of the drugs.Deputy Commissioner of Police Arul R B Krishna said the supply chain, including the route through which the drugs reached Keala, was being investigated. It is suspected that the drugs arrived from across the border, and it is being investigated whether it has come from Pakistan. Scrutiny of the money transaction involved in the operation confirmed that the gang is having international links, he said.In a similar case, the Excise Department had arrested five persons from Aluva with 1.5 kg of brown sugar last year, which was procured from a suspected Pakistani agent in Srinagar. The Narcotic Control Bureau (NCB) has found out that drug rackets in Kerala have moved to Kashmir for procuring narcotic substances like brown sugar, heroin and MDMA.Now, drugs started entering the country through the porous borders of Jammu and Kashmir. The money is transacted through hawala operators based in Dubai. In most cases, the kingpins of the gangs operate from the Middle East and remain unidentifiable, said an NCB official."

These factors led to huge loss for the sugar producers. So, they are not able to clear the dues for the cane growers, he told.Replying to a query over the rationale of announcing the stated advised price (SAP) for sugarcane procurement when the private mills allegedly fail to offer the rate, raised by DMK member Saba Rajendran, Thangamani noted, The SAP needs to be announced to protect the interests of the cane growers who supply the produce to the cooperative sugar mills as well.The Industries Minister, MC Sampath said, We have sought loans for the cooperative and public sector sugar mills worth Rs 349.40 crore. Once the loan is received, the dues will be cleared. He said that the issue would be taken to the notice of the Chief Minister for further action."

58fd4c4b7be9e06c93719060,‘No’ to milk maybe good. here’s why,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2016/nov/09/no-to-milk-maybe-good-heres-why-1536766.html,2016-11-09,"BENGALURU: What is Cows Milk Protein Intolerance?Cows milk protein intolerance (CMPI) is an abnormal reaction to protein found in cows milk. The immune system normally protects our bodies from harm caused by bacteria or viruses. A milk allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly recognizes the milk protein as something the body should fight off. This starts an allergic reaction, which can cause an infant to be fussy and irritable, and cause an upset stomach and other symptomsRisk factors for developing CMPI include having a parent or sibling with allergic disease (like asthma, eczema, and seasonal allergies). Infants who are breastfed have a lower risk of developing a milk allergy than those who are formula fed.What are the Types of CMPICows milk protein intolerance can be divided into immediate reaction and delayed reaction. The two types have different symptoms associated with each.Immediate reaction, symptoms usually start within 2 hours of drinking cows milk. In delayed reaction, symptoms happen later, from 48 hours to 1 week after drinking cows milk.What are the signs and symptoms of CMPI?Signs and symptoms of cows milk protein intolerance are very diverse. Symptoms will usually develop within the first week of starting cows milk in their diet. Most infants will show signs that involve the skin or tummy. Tummy related symptoms can include vomiting, abdominal pain, blood in the stools, and diarrhea. Skin symptoms include hives and eczema. Babies can also present with breathing difficulty, irritability, facial swelling, and poor growth due to poor absorption of nutrients.When should you consult a doctor?Red flags: Increased tiredness or lethargy, fevers, severe vomiting or diarrhea, not tolerating any feedings, weight loss, blood in the stools.Is lactose intolerance the same as milk allergy?No. Milk allergy is a reaction by the bodys immune system to the protein in milk, whereas lactose intolerance is the inability to digest the sugar lactose, which is rare in infants and more common among older kids and adults.Some parents confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance. Milk allergy usually appears in the first year of life, whereas symptoms of lactose intolerance are uncommon before age 2 or 3 years. Most children outgrow milk allergy.How is CMPI diagnosed?Describing what your child is experiencing to the physician is very important in making the diagnosis of this disease. The timing of the symptoms in relation to starting feeds with cows milk protein is also a key in diagnosis. Whether there is a family history of allergies, asthma, or eczema can be helpful for diagnosis.CMPI also is diagnosed after seeing how your child responds to the elimination of cows milk from the diet.What tests are needed to diagnose CMPI?Blood tests and other invasive studies are not always helpful in diagnosing cows milk protein intolerance. Checking for blood in the stool of infants suspected of having CMPI can be helpful in diagnosing this disorder. Your physician may recommend tests to exclude other problems.What is the treatment?In breastfed infants with CMPI, the mother must exclude all dairy and soy products from her diet and continue breastfeed. This may be difficult, and is helped by having a dietitian discuss hidden sources of dairy and soy with the mother prior to starting the elimination diet.Giving goats milk or sheeps milk will not improve CMPI. Soy milk also is not recommended. Many infants will have similar allergic reactions to the proteins in these milks or soy-based formula.The treatment of CMPI includes eliminating cows milk protein from the infants diet. Elimination diets are usually started with extensively hydrolyzed formulas. These formulas are made up of broken down proteins and can be digested without an immune reaction. These formulas will work in most of patients (90%) with CMPI. In some patients, it is necessary to use amino-acid (building blocks of proteins) based formulas.Will my child outgrow CMPI?Cows milk protein allergy resolves in 50% of infants by the age 1 year, and more than 75% by 3 years and more than 90% by 6 years of age.Most infants that are started on cows milk-free formulas or breastfed by a mother on a cows milk-free diet will need to remain on the diet for about 6-12 months. At that point, the child can be challenged with cows milk, and if they have no reactions, milk can be put back into the childs diet.(The writer is a PaediatricGastroenterologist and Surgeon, Narayana Health City)"

Not this border town in Arunachal,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/nov/15/anyone-for-a-boycott-of-chinese-goods-not-this-border-town-in-arunachal-1538921.html,2016-11-15,"MECHUKA (Arunachal Pradesh): This is a town of 13,000 people and just seven policemen on the border with Tibet. It's a heavily-militarised garrison, which boasts of Indias latest advanced landing ground (ALG) at an altitude of 6,200 feet. As you might expect, they people are fiercely patriotic.But unlike in other parts of India, it's not a town that's too keen on a boycott of Chinese goods. For the biggest poroblem for the people of Mechuka is the monthly trip to the grocer. For they have to travel eight hours to get their essentials from Aalo, the HQ of West Siang district. Given a choice, they would cross the border to buy their supplies in Tibet rather than trudge to their district headquarters.As the crow flies, Mechuka is 29 km from the Tibetan border and 50 km by road from the Lola Pass. In contrast, Aalo is 186 km away. There's just one road to Aalo and it is as good as nonexistent. Ironically, it was built only a decade ago. Travelling to Aalo is not only taxing, it also entails transport expenditure of Rs 1000 per person.So it's no wonder that the people of Mechuka, more than 30 per cent of whom are Buddhists and have historic ties with Tibet, would rather shop closer home than go to Aalo.In Mechuka itself, not too many local people can afford to buy the few goods available in the town market. Traders mark up the prices steeply to factor in the cost of transport.K L Mosing, Mechuka's panchayat member and the secretary of the Mechuka Bazaar Committee, says, Before 1947, we had easy access to Tibet. Our people used to go there to buy and sell goods. Their people also used to come here for trade. Those days, the nearest Tibetan town, Gaja, was four-five days walk for our parents and elders. When India attained Independence, it brought an end to border trade here, he says.The need for closer ties is not only trade related but cultural too. People of several tribes such as the Menpa, Monpa, Khampa, Yuba and Kempa have relations across the border.Kesang Goiba, president of the village chieftains committee, has been lobbying for resumption of border trade and feels that India would benefit from it. ""There is tremendous demand in Tibet for our liquor, sugar, bidis, he says.In the days before Tibet's annexation by China, there used to be a thriving barter trade here, predominantly Indian sugar for Tibetan rock salt. To this day, Tibetans are often caught for straying across the border in search of Yarje Gomu, a prized insect that is believed to have medicinal properties. Soup made from it is drunk for strength and youth.Resumption of border trade would not only help us to buy goods at cheaper rates, it would also give us an opportunity to meet our relatives, said Koje Maling, a local BJP leader.As per the 2011 census, Mechuka has a population of 13,310 of which some 5,000 are Buddhists. The rest are people belonging to the indigenous Donyi Polo faith and Christians. The Mechuka sub-division has just one primary health centre, one higher secondary school, four upper primary schools, four private schools (teaching up to class VIII) and no college. The nearest college is at Aalo."

On Christmas, every Christian household has a huge spread for lunch and this wine serves as an accompaniment. City Express spoke to a few Chennaiites who began the process of wine making at home a few months ago.Juhina Sabrina Samuel, moved to Chennai from Kolkata a couple of months ago. She brought along, her family recipe of making wine. I have been making wine for the past 15 years and I specialise in organic wine, she says. She sees to it that there is a variety in flavour when it comes to making wine. This year I have made ginger-mint wine, rice wine, blackcurrant wine and the usual grape wine, she adds.Sunish P Surendran & RomaniAgarwal/MallikaIt is customary to have a glass of wine on Christmas, Mallika Angela Chaudhuri says it is to celebrate the birth of Christ. Homemade wine is non-alcoholic.We drink not to get high because of alcohol, but the sugar in the wine gives us the sugar high which also secretes the happy hormones. The homemade wine is sweeter and not as strong as those in stores.Everyone has a different style of preparing the wine. While Juhina began the process of fermentation six month ago, Smitha Kuttayya Boppanda made it three months back. The fruits are boiled in water along with sugar and yeast is added to it. You need to wait till all the yeast dies.You will know it when you see it. That means the fermentation process is done. After that begins the actual work. You have to strain it 20-25 times, she shares.Smitha has made grape, pineapple, green apple, mango and mixed fruit wine this season. People in Chennai appreciate homemade wine. Sugar acts as a preservative in this wine and we can store it, As long as you store, the stronger it gets, she adds.At Mallikas house, her aunt and uncle make the wine. My Aunt Coleen has a special recipe. We make two varieties of wine- Strawberry-grape and Champagne-grape. The latter is my aunts recipe for which she sources yeast from Australia. It is a hit among our customers, she says.They sell the wine at their takeway restaurant Anglo Auntys Takeaway. Our customers liked it so much so that we have the wine throughout the year, she quips. At their house, the distillation process is different. We ferment the wine for three to four weeks. If we start distilling the third week, the wine is stronger and if it is in the fourth it is softer, she explains.Smitha and Juhina experiment with various flavours. Born and brought up in Coorg, Smitha was always surrounded by fruits and every fruit became wine. I have made guava, ginger and rose petal flavoured wines. But the most unique ones were paan and banana.Last year I made paan flavoured wine and it was the easiest. I just used the betel leaves and the wine was hit-the-roof strong, she smiles. With Chennai being hot throughout the year, one needs to be very careful about storing it in the right temperature. I choose the coolest room in my house to keep it going. Sometimes the weather here is damp and the chances of the wine to spoil are high, she adds.While Juhinas favourite is rice wine, Smitha picks rose. Rice wine seems very bland but as you drink it gives a burning sensation. I also like blackcurrant as I add some cinnamon to give it a rich taste, says Juhina. Mallika chooses her wine, based on the food. Wine basically cleanses your palette. I would choose the champagne to go with thick meaty food and strawberry-grape to go with red meat,she says."

For these types, result of Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) will come abnormal and the fasting result will be abnormal.The selected people were divided into two groups. One group was followed up for every three months, after giving physical activity and also good diet practice. Other group was ignored.When screened after three months, some prediabetics showed uncontrolled diabetes, and were given metformin.The results showed that, a stepwise diabetes prevention programme reduced the three-year diabetes risk by 32% in obese Asian Indian adults with no form of prediabetes.We observed that people with iIGT responded well and also people with combined iIGT and iIFG also responded well after diet watch and 30 minutes of walking for five days. But sugar levels were elevated in iIFG despite physical exercise and diet and also given metformin. So, next trial should be to see what will help the iIFG group, said V Mohan, founder of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai, and one of the senior authors of the study.The study also found that intervention effect was stronger in men than in women.

Later, she was asked to pay a bribe of Rs 1,000 each to the hospitals anaesthetist and the gynaecologist, the patient alleged. When Saraswati refused because I didnt have the money, the doctor discharged her from the hospital, she said.Considering the media reports on the incident, District Collector E Devadasan ordered the DMO to probe the charges. I have not got a complaint yet, but have asked the DMO for a detailed report, and it will be submitted by 11.30 tomorrow, he said on Thursday.The DMO said the allegations were serious, and he had informed the higher-ups in the department. We are meeting at the collectorate tomorrow at 10.30 am and a report will be ready by 11.30 am, Dinesh Kumar said on Thursday.Saraswati first consulted the gynaecologist, Dr Jyoti, at her private clinic at Pulikkunnu. The doctor told me that my uterus has slipped down and will have to be surgically removed, she said. The gynaecologist advised her to check into General Hospital for the surgery.Saraswati got admitted in the hospital Monday afternoon, and had a tribe certificate. But the gynaecologist said the certificate was not enough. She will have to pay the anaesthetist (Venkatagiri K M) and her Rs 1,000 each for the surgery, said the mother of a girl child.When she said she did not have that much money, the doctor discharged her and asked her to return when she had money.According to Kasargod DySP , Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau, Dr Venkatagiri was probed for corruption earlier too. We did a quick verification and recommended departmental action against him, he said.When contacted, Dr Venkatagiri, who is also the honorary secretary of the Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists, said the surgery did not take place because the patient did not have her case history with her, and did not arrange for blood. Moreover, her bystander was just her little daughter studying in class 8, he said.When asked about the allegations of demanding bribe, he said: I have my private practice like all other government doctors. People think the consulting fee I charge at home is bribe, he said and added that patients were referred to him by other doctors.But several patients the Express spoke to said why would they meet a government anaesthetist privately when his service would be available once they get admitted in the hospital. The fact is he will not give a date for surgery until he gets his Rs 1,000, said a person, whose wife underwent a Caesarean delivery two months ago at General Hospital.His wifes was an emergency case. But Dr Venkatagiri rushed into the room and said my wifes blood sugar level and pressure were high and she was not ready for operation, the person said. But my mother-in-law who knew his ways asked him should she meet him at his house, and he cooled down immediately, he said. That afternoon, his bother-in-law went to the doctors house and paid him Rs 1,000, and he scheduled the C-section for the next day."

The latter is an annual campaign with the goal of stimulating and supporting practical actions that will help people achieve and maintain a healthy weight, while and reverse the global obesity crisis. The former, however, is a movement that began closer to home, vociferously campaigned by health and fitness venture VLCC, and focusing more on it as a pandemic crisis.While obesity does not discriminate, the Global Nutrition Report conducted this year assessed that a growing rate of overweight people in the country prevailed, resulting in high risk of diabetes and heart diseases in the country. Incidentally, India has also been ranked high on malnourishment, paving way for extreme results based on the Body Mass Index (BMI) of most of the population. Women, particularly in south India, are the ones battling obesity more than men. City Express tries to find out what ails the population and why it continues.India is recognised as a potpourri of all kinds of food. Travel a 100 km in any direction and you get cuisines and flavours that are completely different. Some are fried to the point they drip oil after every bite, while others are filled with masalas and spices. Basing this as one of the reasons, Dr Anbhezhil Subbarayan, an endocrinologist with Apollo Hospitals, believes that while the food in the country maybe delicious and tempting, a balanced intake is the need of the hour. Food with fat and sugar tastes so much better and people tend to go with that, without thinking much about the health hazards. Its difficult to keep your intake in check if the food is so good, he opines.Carbohydrates are consumed more in south Indian cuisine too. You cannot say that obesity isnt rampant in rural areas, but usually in urban areas it happens due to the lifestyle. The amount of calories you consume and what you burn to be balanced. Its easy to say that you eat less but its not the same when you talk about the food you have actually consumed, he adds.Dietitians and experts from VLCC Wellness Centre notice a pattern of why women fall prey to obesity more here. Southern states in India have better socio-economic indicators than other states. In these states, female education is comparatively higher. Moreover, the proportion of women living below the poverty line is comparatively less in the south than the northern or eastern regions in India. So, having a favourable environment in these states, women can have a sedentary lifestyle, which may further lead to overweight or obesity, adds an expert.But singling out food as the sole reason would seem unfair. Dr Shashikala, consultant diabetologist from Venkataeswara Hospitals, highlights other possible reasons. Food and lifestyle are factors, but so are hormones. With more fast food and oily foods now, lifestyles have changed drastically. Invariably, now youll find most of the women suffering from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), she avers.She also adds that irregular menstrual cycles result in weight gain. Add to this, most women tend not to focus on their bodies after pregnancy. Citing reasons that they dont have time or have to take care of kids, women end up putting on weight more and it becomes difficult to lose it, she says.Bearing this in mind, doctors however, vouch that there is hope. While physical exercises such as going to gyms is an option, there are many who arent aware of a simple technique called NEAT  Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis, says Subbarayan. These are the little things you can do to counter obesity, especially when you have no time.For example, when you read a book, you can do it standing or walking around. Or if you have the option of using the lift or staircase, opt for the latter. Instead of relying on help, try doing your own day-to-day to activities such as washing, sweeping etc. These small little things go a long way and if you do it regularly, it makes a huge difference in the future, he adds."

Conducting tests free of cost, the event was all about spreading awareness on beating diabetes. Doctors on duty had their kit ready as they conducted a variety of tests such as foot test, thyroid screening, lipid profile, bone mineral test, Hb1Ac test, cholesterol check, and body fat composition test,among others.These tests are more extensive than the regular tests for diabetes because theyll tell the person if he/she is diabetic or not today itself, said Bijo Joseph, marketing head, Apollo. The fest also had interactive sessions with dietitians and endocrinologists, along with a zumba and yoga session for all. The idea behind the fest was to promote the notion that diabetes can be controlled if one keeps their food intake and lifestyle in check.Chief guest of the fest, Prof Dr Shantaram, senior consultant diabetologist, Apollo Sugar, emphasised on inculcating precaution from the primary stages, especially among children, which is the need of the hour. Diabetes is prevalent mostly in the Southern states due to the high intake of rice and carbohydrates. The eating pattern is a lot different from that of the Northern states. Moreover, when you look at it now, children seldom have their PT hours in school and choose to stay indoors and use computers. Pesticides and other synthetic products are used to grow plants. So parents need to identify this first, eliminate sedentary lifestyle and make children exercise to become active, he said.The fest also saw the launch of Apollo Sugars new recipe book D for Delicious, a compilation of around 20 vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for diabetic patients, penned by dietitians from Apollo Clinics all over India. Chef Vellaisamy Ganesh S of Residency Hotel demonstrated some of the recipes from the book, including one main course, a health drink, and a salad."

We have given blood for test on empty stomach, now we were told to do postprandial sugar test. For that, nobody is ready to take the note. All I have is a Rs 500 note, what should I do now? the woman, who was almost in tears, asked.In a similar case, another woman was seen helpless with a toddler and her elderly mother at the hospital. Mala, aged 25, who had come from Kancheepuram along with her elderly mother could not get breakfast for her child as she had only Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.The post office at the RGGGH campus also turned them away saying it did not have change.I want to get food for my little daughter, she is hungry and crying, but no one is accepting these notes. We dont know who will help us, Mala told Express.In the scanning departments, the staff were ready to accept Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. But they too ran out of notes of lesser denominations to tender change. This forced staff in a few scanning sections to maintain a ledger to record how much change they owe to whom.We could not circulate change, as most of the patients brought Rs 1,000 note even for a Rs 500 scan. So, we have asked scan in-charge staff to accept Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and write on a slip the balance change to be returned. Patients can come on Monday and get it. We are also maintaining a ledger for it, said Sheela Rani, Medical Superintendent, RGGGH.But the trouble is for patients from far away places who again have to travel to the hospital to get the change.Patients at the Super Multi-Speciality Hospital at Omandurar Estate faced the same problem at the canteen."

Pulling up their socks and running for their favourite paal ice (milk popsicle) and semiya ice (vermicelli popsicle), people raced each other to reach the approaching ice cream vandi first, to pick out the classic kutchi ice creams. The 10-15 paise that was returned to the ice cream anna would make his day! From comparing the colour stains on our tongue to finding the best bet to splurge on, they were a joyous part of our lives.Fast forward to the present, and what you get is an explosion of flavours at the comfort of a luxurious lounge, with multiple sauces and rainbow sprinkles. The concept of ice creams have taken a huge leap over the years and City Express takes a look at the evolution of ice creams in namma ooru  from paal ice to Pineapple Passion and from grape ice to a Guava-salt-chili kulfi!Back in the 70s, only a handful of ice cream brands thrived in the city including brands like Rita, Joy and Remmi. When we were kids, the semiya paal ice (vermicelli popsicle), Choco bar and the locally-made kulfi were the only options when it came to ice creams, recalls 48-year-old Malathy. The kulfi-wallah used to be a regular in our neighbourhood and a saviour during sultry nights! He used to place the kesar kulfi on a leaf and cut it. It was heavenly to binge on them!Shops like Jaffars Ice Cream Parlour (near Elphinstone Theatre) served the best Falooda and Tooty Fruity; Universal produced only vanilla and rose ice cream cups, and Lexumi Ice Cream Parlour near Panagal Park used to serve the best cone ice cream.But for the 80s kids, the change in the ice cream industry happened right in the cusp. Ice creams were limited to choco-bar and ice cream cups available in just four to five flavours. Then came Milky Way and Baskin Robins bringing about a change during the mid-90s with their softy ice creams and variety of flavours in the city.When we went back to school after vacations, it was time for Pepsi. These were not bottled colas but brightly coloured frozen drinks in thin plastic tubes. I remember sucking on flavours of orange, grape and lime costing `5 each, smiles Arwindh Paneerselvam.With trends shifting to concept, handcrafted and scroll ice creams, we have a tough time deciding where to head for ice creams, much less deciding between the droolicious flavours. The birthday cake ice cream from Amadora, ChocoMint gelato from Padrino, Rangeela Kulfi from Bombay Kulfithe list is endless. With 10 years of experience in the industry, Ravindra, store manager at Cream Stone, says that every place has its own style and method of making ice creams. The customer will think that the process is same. But, if you observe closely, the styles and flavours are different. From the amount of sugar and cream to flavours, and the concept of experimentation, everything differs, he opines.Claiming that Chennai and the whole of South has an ice cream industry which is internationalised, Hitesh Khanna, the franchise owner of Bombay Kulfi, Chennai, shares that the gap between the international brands and the desi ice creams need to be bridged. In the north, ice golas and fruit ice creams are available on mobile carts even today. Thats missing in Chennai! And thats why we wanted to introduce a desi touch to traditional kulfis, he shares. With flavours such as tender coconut ice cream, kesar, Gulkhand becoming a big hit, he claims that the guava-flavoured kulfi, sprinkled with salt and chili is their best seller.Over the years, people have opened up to trying new flavours. Kshama Adka of Shmoozies Handcrafted Ice Creams says that people are giving more importance to flavour these days and prefer clean and natural flavours. Back then, multiple sauces used to be added and the original flavour was lost. People are turning to straight flavours and its great news for us, as we take hours to make natural-flavoured ice creams using seasonal ingredients, she explains. Though the ice cream industry here is not thriving as in other cities we are slowly getting there and people are becoming more open to new concepts."

They worry about its behaviour and comfort inside the smaller living space. Dr Bhagwat VG lists breeds that are best suited for apartment-living, keeping in mind their temperament and needsPomeranianPomeranians, the small and feisty dogs with pricked ears and foxy face, are found in most Indian households. They adapt well to apartment living as they are small and require very little exercise. These dogs are attractive, especially with their scraggly yet feathery coats and arched tails. Even though they are easy to maintain, they are known for their unstable temperaments. These furballs need to be dealt with tough love as they bark a lot and may not meekly accept their mischief. Pomeranians shed heavily and require frequent brushing and trimming of messy hair.PugThis cute dog has become a hot Indian favourite. They do not require large space to run around, making them ideal apartment dwellers. With their wrinkled, squishy appearance, pugs are playful, loyal and highly intelligent. They tend to get bored without regular exercise or interaction with their owners. They also tend to develop breathing trouble and tend to be obese.DachshundsGreat for small living spaces, dachshunds are a popular breed that come with a pack of attitude. They are playful, friendly and affectionate breed that also makes for a keen watchdog. They are an average shredder and have long and low bodies. It is extremely essential to maintain their weight as exerting strain on their back could possibly break or damage their spine.Shih TzuIf you are looking for an apartment-friendly pooch which is small, sturdy, intelligent that doesnt need much outdoor exercise, then Shih Tsu must be your ultimate choice. This little canine cannot tolerate extreme temperature and are mostly found indoors making them ideal for apartments. It requires constant patience and persistence to train this frisky canine. Shih Tsus shed every day and are prone to allergies hence, it is vital to brush and bathe them regularly.PekingesePekingese are small, quiet dogs with dark fur facial mask. These dogs are courageous and loyal. They require stern training to counteract their stubbornness. Pekingeses long hair needs to be constantly brushed. They do not enjoy exercise but it is good to take them out for a walk every few hours.Lhasa ApsoStanding approximately under a foot tall, Lhasa Apso has proven to be one of the best pets for people residing in apartments. Lhasas are adorable, small and sturdy dogs that are too cute to be legal. They do not bark constantly without a reason and are an excellent watchdog. They have a long lustrous durable coat that often gets tangled and requires regular grooming. However, at the same time, they do not shed much and are easy to maintain.ChihuahuaWith small, sturdy appearance and big round eyes, it is almost impossible to overlook Chihuahuas cuteness. They are adorable, great for small spaces, good watch dogs and easy to groom. Chihuahuas mostly bond well with just one person, making them ideal for people living alone. However, Chihuahuas can be very fragile and tend to bark loudly. Chihuahuas are often known to suffer from low-blood sugar and also have an underdeveloped soft spot in their skull.BeagleBeagles are sturdy, athletic dogs that were initially developed as hunting dogs. They are handsome, easy to groom, peaceful and friendly dogs. They will make good companions for both kids and adults. At the same time, they can be stubborn and require stern training. It may not be wise to leave Beagles unmonitored as they may wander, howl and dig holes. They are moderate- to-heavy shedders.PoodlePoodles are one of the most attractive breeds that are elegant, energetic and intelligent. Poodles learn quickly, respond well to training and will often pay rapt attention to you. They make good watch dogs but are not very aggressive in nature. They are sensitive dogs that will require constant attention. Poodles are known to suffer from eye diseases."

A pioneer realised three decades ago that Olympic-level athletes are not made overnight, that it is a continuous process and requires time and effort. And so S M Kaluti built a sports school.Tucked away in the remote Chandargi village of Belagavi district, this school is doing its bit to catch sporting talents young.Like Prashant E, son of an agricultural labourer from Raichur. The 13-year-old is a well-known name in cycling in India. Last month, he won a gold medal at the Association Meet National Cycling competition. Three Class 9 students bagged gold medals for securing highest points for their team in National Level Kho Kho meet held in Chhattisgarh.There are hundreds of such inspiring stories of sportsmen emerging from this school. The Composite Sports High School boasts of infrastructure for all games like football, tennis, kho-kho and Sepak Takraw  Malaysian kick volleyball game.Thirty years ago, as a wrestler, Kaluti wanted to create a sporting facility in Chandargi. But he had to battle several odds. Recalling the struggle, Kaluti says his idea was met by incredulity. Many were surprised that he wanted to start a residential sports school.As the cooperative movement was at its peak in Maharashtra and Karnataka then, he wanted to build the school on a cooperative model. But not many were enthused as they felt sugar factories would give them higher revenue. I had to convince educationists and leaders in the cooperative sector. The idea was welcomed slowly and the share holders came forward, Kaluti says.We approached the royal scion of Torgal, Uday Singh Narsoji Rao Shinde, for his palace property near Chandargi for the school. He sold the huge palace for just `1.25 lakh. He also paid the stamp duty. We purchased 18 acres around the palace and today our school is spread over 100 acres. Help poured in and the number of our share holders grew, he recalls. It is the only residential school in India which is run by a sports co-operative.During the Asian Games in New Delhi in 1983, I was stunned by the performance of international sportsmen. I thought if the right infrastructure was provided, we too could produce national-level champions. Chandargi school is best suited to prepare Olympians, says Kaluti, who is also the managing director of Munavalli Sugars in Belagavi district.Today 600 students study in this school and are involved in different sports. They are taught in both Kannada and English. Besides achieving glory in sporting events, the school has also been giving 100 per cent results in SSLC for years.It is not all play and no work for the students. Their day begins at 6am with jogging and cycling. Schooling begins at 9am and they return to their respective sports by evening for practice."

Another person who suffered burn injuries was identified as Arun (22), a tenant in Nareshs residence in Kurubarahalli. All three were part of the plan that went awry.According to police, Naresh and Gajendra were childhood friends. Naresh had piled up debts worth Rs 1.5 crore following huge losses in business. He had also insured his shop for around Rs 2 crore. Recently Naresh confided to them about his business losses and mounting debts. Gajendra suggested that Naresh burn down his shop and assured him that he would get at least `1.8 crore from the insurance firm.As planned on Thursday night, Naresh closed his shop unusually early, at around 9pm. Around 3.15am on Friday, Arun and Gajendra came to the shop with petrol to set it on fire. Arun stayed on the ground floor while Gajendra went to the first floor. Arun poured petrol on the floor. But due to an electric short-circuit, a fire broke out. Arun ran out as the batteries began to explode and he sustained burn injuries on his back. Gajendra was trapped. He ran up to the fourth floor but the door was locked. He ran back down but got caught in the fire and was charred to death.By then Arun, who had informed Naresh about the incident, got himself admitted in a hospital in Girinagar. Naresh came to his shop at around 5.30am. To avoid questioning, Naresh told police that his sugar levels had shot up."

CrossFit challenges. Coconut jigarthanda. There was nothing predictable about this health and fitness expo.Stepping into the third edition, Arogyam, organised by The New Indian Express and Apollo Hospitals, served up a wellness cocktail that was as exciting for the sedentary housewife as it was for a bodybuilder.Sample this. A cool blue face mask that prevents migraines and pimples at the same time. And just a few feet away, a more muscular set of walk-ins lifting tractor tyres as part of a condensed gym workout. Who said shopping has to be the only exercise you get at a wellness exhibition?The latter, which turned out to be one of the highlights of the event, was a real treat to watch. Teams of five were clocked on how long they would take to do a CrossFit challenge - so called because each exercise works out a different muscle group. From playing battle rope to heavy weight lifting, high jumps to trolley pushing, this was a high intensity cardio set to fast beats and often finished within 10 minutes. With all five people pushing their limits relay-style, the cheering from the audience possibly had just as much adrenaline as the players.There were several takers for complimentary health check-ups covering blood tests, sugar levels, fertility, dental and eye tests. A series of talks on gall stone issues, paleo diet, tips to prevent lifestyle diseases and overcoming anxiety saw some taking notes in the evening."

The doctors had to try skin grafting.Skin grafting is performed when there is an extensive damage to skin from burns or accidents. A skin graft is a piece of skin removed from one part of body and transplanted on to the wounded area.Dr Pawan, a veterinarian from Cessna, says, Normal wounds can be treated with laser or photo therapy. When a severe wound is not going to heal and leaves scars that may get infected, we go for skin grafting.Stripes was suffering from a severe burn injury which seemed to be from an electric shock. She was found under a flyover by a goodhearted person on September 20 and was rushed to Cessna Hospital.Two days later when the rescuer was forced to travel for weeks, he contacted an animal lover Toni Freer, who runs Haven Animal Welfare Trust. The rescuer cleared the bills of `12,000 and left her with Toni. Few days later, she underwent a skin grafting procedure.Dr B Gowda, a veterinary surgeon at CUPA says, The more the delay in treatment, lesser the chances of a successful skin graft. If the dog stays on the road longer, he could develop infections. Licking or biting the wound can worsen the condition. There are other factors that can lead to complications like age, infections and its medical conditions. If the dog is diabetic, his sugar levels need to be controlled before the surgery. He gets about 30 such cases in a month.Stripes has been undergoing a post operative care at Cartman for a week. A doctor from the hospital says, She is taking antibiotics every day and will completely recover in about ten days.Dr Gowda says, A good protein diet can lead to faster healing. But healing also depends on the immunity of the dog.The surgical procedure takes as long as three hours with an hour and a half hour set aside for the preparation. The preparation includes the disinfecting the dog by giving him medicated baths multiple times. Antibiotics are also given to the animal before the surgery.Stripes has been in post-operative care at Cartman fora week  Pushkar VDepending on the severity of the case, the doctor suggests any of the three techniques  full-thickness mesh skin graft, strip-skin graft or flap-skin graft. Dr Pawan explains, A full-thickness skin graft is used when all layers of the skin are needed to close a wound. The flap skin graft is where the graft is placed on the recipient area with major blood vessels. Strip skin grafting is a technique where the small portions of skins are taken and placed on the wound, allowing it to grow a healthy tissue bed.The cases are seen more among the stray animals. Dr Pawan says that Cessna performs the procedure once in about three months. There are equal numbers of cases both in cats and dogs. Cats generally tend to escape from the house and thus get electrocuted. Dogs are usually the victims of road accidents.Toni declares, Stripes will be the official dog of Haven Animal Welfare Trust. A skin graft surgery costs close to `40,000, says Dr Pawan. There are additional costs for lodging, post operative care like dressing, painkillers and food which may lead to more than a lakh.Toni says, The total cost of treatment for Stripes is `1.39 lakh including the 12,000 that her rescuer paid. The hospital has given about 50 per cent discount. We raised `49,000 and need another `29,000. Toni is crowdfunding for the treatment costs.

Indians are also known to develop Type-II diabetes at a younger age.This year, World Diabetes Day, observed on November 14, will focus on promoting the importance of screening to ensure early diagnosis of Type-II diabetes and its treatment, to reduce the risk of serious complications. This is of huge importance as diabetes is a growing disease burden. The theme this year is Eyes on Diabetes.Dr Arpan Dev Bhattacharya, Consultant Endocrinologist at Manipal Hospital, said One in two adults with diabetes is undiagnosed. Many people suffer from Type-II diabetes for a long time without being aware of their condition. By the time of diagnosis, complications may already be present. Up to 70 per cent of Type-II diabetes cases can be prevented or delayed by adopting healthier lifestyles. Increasing levels of poor nutrition and physical inactivity among children is leading to serious health hazards, he added.Diabetes is commonly understood as a disease of high blood sugar. In the long term, high blood sugar affects various organs of the human body like the eyes and majority of people are unaware of such complications.The management of diabetes and its complications begins in primary health care and this should include screening for diabetic retinopathy, one of the complications. Early detection and timely treatment of diabetic retinopathy can prevent vision loss and reduce the impact of diabetes on individuals, their care givers and society, said Dr Pramila Karla, Professor, Endocrinology Department, M S Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital.PrecautionsThere are a lot of evidences that lifestyle changes (achieving a healthy body weight and moderate physical activity) can help prevent the development of Type-II diabetes.Obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is linked to the development of Type-II diabetes. Physical activity is one of the main pillars in the prevention of diabetes. Increased physical activity is important in maintaining weight loss and is linked to reduced blood pressure, reduced resting heart rate, increased insulin sensitivity, improved body composition andpsychological well-being. A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for health. A healthy diet reduces risk factors for cardiovascular diseases."

It is a nutritious natural preparation having no side effects. It is useful for all types of severe diabetic conditions regardless of age and has no proven side effects.Mehyog is a formulation from centuries-old palm-leaf manuscripts handed down over generations. A combination of ayurvedic herbs, Mehyog Powder has a telling curative effect on most of the accompanying problems of a diabetic, like fatigue, joint pains, sleeplessness, constipation, excessive thirst, frequent urination, pain and numbness of limbs, blurred vision, weight loss despite increased appetite, obesity, erectile dysfunction etc. Mehyog is a nutritious natural preparation having no side effects, a fact proven through medical tests and trials. Almost all diabetic patients from different parts of Kerala have experienced the quality of Mehyog and the relief it has given to them.In a matter of 21 days urinary complaints and stomach disorders will be normalized; numbness and swelling of the hands and legs, joint pains, muscle pain will be reduced; sleeplessness will be cured along with tiredness and weakness if any. Chances of heart attack due to high blood pressure and shortage of insulin is reduced as Mehyog normalises the sugar level in blood. The use of Mehyog helps to strengthen small blood vessels and thereby correct eye problems.Mehyog helps to reduce the intensity of paralysis by pushing up the blood supply to brain and also guards the kidneys from weakness due to high blood pressure and increased sugar level.Mehyog should be used twice a day in the beginning. Those under allopathic medications should take 2 tablespoons of Mehyog powder, one hour before breakfast and dinner. Mix 2 tablespoons of powder (10 gm) in one glass of hot water, and drink when it cools down.(For better result, boil water for a few seconds after adding the powder and filter).When the blood sugar level becomes normal (FBS-100 mg and PPBS-130-140 mg) one can gradually reduce the allopathic medications under a doctors guidance. If sufficient quantity of insulin is not produced in a person, the body fails to utilise sugar properly and the person becomes a diabetic. Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells in the body. Mehyog aims at regenerating destroyed beta cells and thereby producing the required quantity of insulin which keeps the blood sugar level normal. Mehyog helps to develop and build up beta cells. Mehyog can be used by patients having pregnancy diabetes and is suffering from repeated abortions due to diabetes.Since insulin-taking patients head towards dialysis as their last option, Mehyog helps such patients lead a diabetic free life.Mehyog is available in all Ayurveda and English medical shops. Effective treatment is available for all diabetic related ailments at Kandamkulathy Ayurveda hospital, near Desabhimani road, Elamakkara, Ernakulam."

As such, they are demanding access to the markets of Tibet.Aerially, Mechukha is 29km from the Tibetan border and 50km by road from Lola Pass. The road exists for 30km upto Lamang army and ITBP camps. Aalo is 186km from Mechukha, which is a sub-division ofWest Siang. The Buddhists, who account for more than 30% of the population in Mechukha, shared a historic relationship with Tibet even before it was annexed by China.Before 1947, we had easy access to Tibet. Our people used to go there to buy and sell goods. Their people also used to come to Mechukha for trade. Those days, the nearest Tibetan town, Gaja, wasfour-five days walk for our parents and elders. Our miseries compounded manifold after India had attained independence as it brought an end to the border trade, KL Mosing, town panchayat member and Mechukha Bazaar Committee secretary, told Express.From Mechukha, the nearest major Indian town is Aalo. Travelling there to buy essentials is not only taxing, it also entails an expenditure of Rs.1000 per person on transport. So, if we have access tothe Tibetan markets, it will surely mitigate our sufferings, he pointed out.Not many people can afford to buy goods and other essential items in Mechukha as the traders sell them at exorbitant prices citing the cost of transport. The airstrip in Mechukha was built long backbut the solitary road that connects the town with Aalo is as good as non-existent. Ironically, it was built only a decade ago.Kesang Goiba, president of village chieftains committee, too felt that border trade was the only way out.Weve given a number of representations to the authorities for resumption of border trade. Disconnect with our Tibetan brothers (Menpa, Monpa, Khampa, Yuba and Kempa tribes are on either side ofthe border) has made our lives harder. We need a road upto the border. There is tremendous demand in Tibet for our local liquor, sugar, bidi (notcigarettes), Goiba said.He said their forefathers used to barter sugar with Tibetan rock salt. Tibetans are often caught for straying across the border in search of Yarje Gomu, a prized insect which is believed to havemedicinal properties. Soup made from it is drunk for strength and youthful maintenance of body, he said.The resumption of border trade would not only help us to buy goods at cheaper rates, it would also give us an opportunity to meet our relatives, said Koje Maling, a local BJP leader.As per the 2011 census, Mechukha has a population of 13,310 of which some 5,000 are Buddhists. The rest are people belonging to indigenous Donyi Polo faith and Christians. The sub-division has justone primary health centre, one higher secondary school, four upper primary schools, four private schools (upto class VIII) but no college. The nearest college is at Aalo. Surprisingly, there are just seven police personnel to maintain law and order."

The 33 dispensaries functioning across 74 divisions in the corporation limits are currently reeling under shortage of drugs to be rolled out to the public.These homoeo dispensaries cater mostly to people from financially backward classes who depend on the treatment for their children. Even elders who are battling blood pressure, sugar and cholesterol are regular visitors at these dispensaries. Most of them also have patients from neighboring districts and also cater to the migrant labourers as well."" As we don't have enough money to shell out for costly treatment and for medicine, we visit these homeo dispensaries. However, even the most primary medicines are not available at times. Though we have approached the corporation councilors several times, they are really not bothered,"" said an elderly citizen who was forced to approach a private medical store for his medicines."

With pomp and zero rules. From the time we started celebrating Chennais birthday (over a decade ago, in 2004), theres only been one criterion: everyone does it their way. And this year, on the 377th birthday, this has translated into a very inclusive event. There are walks for the differently-abled, play themes for the elderly, story telling sessions for children and more. We even have a talk on temples in Vietnam, which seems like an unusual topic, laughs historian V Sriram. We did wonder if it should be included, but then (historian) S Muthiah made a point: this is the place from where temple building went across the seasthe Cholas left from Tamil Nadu and introduced the Hindu culture to places like Ceylon and Vietnam. So, in a way, it is also a celebration of Madras, he explains. With over 50 walks, and an equal number of talks, exhibitions, performances and more, heres our pick of things to do in the days to come.Under the gopuramWe visit temples, but how many of us notice the inscriptions on the walls? At the Marundeeswarar Temple, it details the workings of the Chola administration, like tax collection. There is much to discover, says Pradeep Chakravarthy, a history buff who runs Mystical Palmyra, a portal that organises heritage tours. Did you know there was a thriving Jain population in Thiruvanmiyur back then? We will explore the history, songs and architecture, he says. There are also games like aadu puli aattam etched on the floor and you can learn how to play them, with some help from Kreeda Games Vineetha Siddhartha. August 27, from 7-7.45 am.

The day V Sriram conducts his heritage walk. This year, too, the historian promises an informative two-and-a-half hours. When the harbours construction began in 1875, it was classified as one of the greatest challenges man faced against nature. Its a story of hard work, sacrifice, foresight, politics and more, he says. While there, spot surviving symbols (like the foundation stone), learn how the port helped mathematician S Ramanujan, and how it even featured in slave trade. Those interested can opt for a sailing experience (at 11 am, Rs 500) and see the three arms of the harbour. Last date for registration is today. On August 14, at 6.30 am. Rs 850, including breakfast.

So now her organisation, Nam Veedu Nam Oor Nam Kadhai, conducts walks in these neglected parts.join her for a wander down the narrow lanes of Aminjikarai. Did you know its also called Mini Kanchipuram because it has the Varadaraja Perumal Temple and the Ekambareswarar Temple. The houses also still retain the old flavour, with thinnai and thalvaram, she says.Details: annanagarshg@gmail.comHit the waterLast years floods brought the sorry state of our marshlands into focus. While government action is a matter of debate, the Madras Naturalists Society is continuing with their efforts to spread awareness. Join them on two walks in the days to come: to the Perumbakkam Tank (August 20, 6.30 am) and the Kelambakkam backwaters (August 21, 6.30 am). We will focus on how these water bodies sustain vibrant eco-systems, recharge the water table and help prevent floods, begins G Vijay Kumar, the societys honorary secretary. If you are lucky, you will get to spot over 40 species of birds, including painted storks, pelicans and coots. Last year, we spotted flamingoes. The juveniles usually stay back. They are equivalent to our 21st century teens, who want to chill out, especially when there is plenty of food to be had, he laughs. Details: gopivkumar58@gmail.comBritish footprintsYoull find plenty on the British in Madras on Wikipedia and in books. But theres something to be said about the information being presented to us as stories. Vijay Kamalakara, the founder of Storytrails, is leading two walks that will talk about the British and how their rule impacted the city. Stories are an interesting way to look at the social histories behind buildings and monuments as these were built by real people, driven by human emotions. The first will begin from the Gandhi statue on Marina Beach (August 20, 6 am), and will meander from the Lighthouse to the War Memorial, and the second (August 21, 6 am) will be from Beach Station to the Fort. Find out how the British convinced Indian soldiers to travel abroad to fight, and more. Details: 9940040215Blooms and trunksThe lofty trees that line our roads are oft overlooked, unless its noon and we need the shade. But Nizhal, the organisation that promotes tree culture in urban spaces, is making sure we dont forget them or how fast they are disappearing. This year, their walks will focus on landmark trees. These are old (some over 90 years) and rare trees that are irreplaceable, says Shobha Menon, one of the trustees. The walks at Marina Beach and Egmore Museum (Sunday, 8 am and 4.30 pm) will highlight rare trees like the Arjuna, while at the Kotturpuram Tree Park (August 15, 4.30 pm), a dump yard that we converted into a forest, children who volunteer with us will lead the walk, she says. Menon will also lead a walk at Nandanam (August 21, 8 am), to where plant artist OP Ravindran lived. He planted some rare trees, like the Ashoka and the Purasu (Flame of the Forest), and I will focus on them and stories about him, she adds.

The three-hour walk is open to the differently-abled. With support from Explore Differently, an online forum, it will be led by the academys regional director, Venkatesh Chakravarthy.

Rs 200.Details: chennaiexploredifferently@gmail.comWord powerCinema isnt just about histrionics; language is key, too. And one of the interesting elements of Tamil cinema is its use of Madras bhashai. This is the slang spoken in the city, one which has evolved over the years and includes a number of words from other languages, like Hindi, Telugu, Urdu and Sanskrit, begins actor V Mohan Raman, who will be focussing on this unique language in his talk this year. I will trace its origin and how actors and comedians used it in films, right from the 1930s to today, he adds. Raman feels that an actor who has mastered the art of Madras bhashai is Kamal Haasan. In Vasool Raja MBBS, he used it flawlessly, he concludes. On August 27, from 6.30-8 pm, at the Park Hyatt. Details: 71771234Through her eyesBharatnatyam dancer Chandralekhas connection with Chennai is a long one, but arts editor Sadanand Menon plans to condense it in his talk, Chandralekha and Chennai Connect, by focussing on two aspects. I will present a poem she wrote between 1968-69, on Madras and how it influenced her, which has since been published in a book called Rainbow on the Roadside. The second part will be more anecdotalabout her coming to the city, learning Bharatnatyam and her experiences while living here (from 1950-2006). She chose to settle down here because she always said this city lets you be, shares Menon.

On August 23, at 6.30 pm, at Chamiers. Details: 24311496Steeple chaseThe last several editions of Madras Week have seen temples being featured quite prominently. This year, scholar Amaladass Anand will take us into the world of Portuguese, Gothic and neo-Gothic styles of churches in the city. I will focus on places like Thomas Mount, Luz Church, Rosary Church (an early Portuguese example), San Thome in Mylapore, St Marys Church in Fort St George, Andrews Church (a Gothic example), and more. Ill highlight the impact of the architectural styles and how the space has been utilised by the architect to evoke the divine, Anand explains. He hopes that the talk will help people understand how religious architects managed the space within these huge structures and the value of such heritage buildings. On August 19, between 5.30 pm and 6.30 pm, at Dhyana Ashram. Details: themadrasday.inPedal pushersSadras Fort is an erstwhile Dutch stronghold. There was a thriving artisan community there, with a lot of mercantile trade, especially in textiles. The influence of the place was so much that they built a fort there, explains Ramanujar Moulana of the Cycling Yogis, a group of cycling and history buffs. Through our cycle ride (August 21, 5 am), I want to look into another aspect of what Madras once was.

Details: storytrails.inCurry talesWhats Madras without its curry powder or milagu thanni soup? Turning the spotlight on them is Rakesh Ragunathan of Puliyogare Travels. For us, curry is a generic term for gravies, but for the British, it is any dish made with almond or coconut milk and spiced with Madras curry powder (a milder version of garam masala). Ill speak about the ingredients that go into its making, explains the TV show host (Sutralam Suvaikalam) and gourmand. The discussion on the soupfirst prepared at the Madras Clubwill be accompanied by a demonstration. Britishers used to enjoy milagu thanni when they were here.

For a healthy heart, Malayalis should reduce their carbohydrate intake and include more fruits in diet, he opined, and stressed the importance of regular exercise in preventing heart diseases.American Heart Association president Mark Creager said that the prevalence of diabetes in society contributed significantly to he high incidence of heart disease.Diabetes patients having high blood pressure and cholesterol are at greater risk of heart diseases, said Creager and cautioned that diabetes patients who fail to control blood sugar would end up being heart patients.Even as the nature of cardiac diseases keep changing, new technologies are evolving, giving fresh hope to patients, said European Society of Cardiology president designate James Blankenship, who also shed light on the latest stents that dissolve into the body.According to European Society of Cardiology president Dr Jeroen Bax, peoples attitude towards new technologies and methods should change.American College of Cardiology president Dr Mary Norine said the majority of the cardiac diseases progress into fatal heart failure."

There were apprehensions that the session that started on November 21 would be yet another washout over the controversial porngate targeting Primary Education Minister Tanveer Sait or the recent murders of RSS workers.Earlier, there were many occasions where the session was adjourned much ahead of schedule with both ruling and opposition parties locking horns on many issues. But this session was a pleasant surprise to many, including the elected members, as core issues like the Mahadayi water dispute and the drought situation were discussed. The House also passed a resolution urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and resolve the Mahadayi dispute. Though there were some protests, they did not kill the whole days proceedings.The opposition had pressed for loan waiver. But the government turned the tables on the Centre and BJP stating that they would go for loan waiver if the Centre waived 50 per cent of the loans.Though more than 11 bills were tabled, only legislations like making registration compulsory of AYUSH doctors to crack down on quackery and others were passed by both Houses.The House also witnessed a lengthy debate on enhancing reservation from 50 to 70 per cent based on the population of Dalits and backward classes. Chief Minister Siddaramaiahs statement to table the caste census survey on socio-economic and educational status of SC/STs and OBCs gave ample scope to make the governments motives clear on reservation.However, the opposition cornered the government on I-T raids on a few top officers allegedly close to a politician in power in the government. It forced the government to state that the officers were already suspended.The opposition criticised the government on increased attacks on RSS workers and alleged that the Home Ministry was handled by the Chief Minister, Home Minister and a super cop Home Minister.But the Opposition could not gain much over the Tanveer Sait issue despite staging a protest demanding his resignation on the last day of the session. The government maintained that the issue was being probed by the COD and there was no point in demanding Saits resignation.Women, landless labourers and sugar cane growers who had turned up in large numbers to protest outside the Suvarana Vidhana Soudha were not heard by the netas. But Sugar Minister H S Mahadeva Prasad managed to call on cane growers and held talks.While opposition members termed the session a failure as the government failed to waive loans, announce compensation and address the problems of the region, the government claimed it was a success as core issues were discussed."

Dhanu Muan, a speciality sweet dish of south Odisha, is mostly sold during the Odia month of Pausa. Apparently, Dhanu Muan of Ganjam district is famous across the State and also exported. The muan is ritualistically prepared and sold between Dhanu Sankranti and Makar Sankranti.According to the locals, Dhanu Muan is related to the economic history of this region. Since long, people of Odisha used to prepare muan for ritualistic offering during puja on Dhanu Sankranti. However, the muan was being prepared with jaggery then. When one of the first sugar mills on east coast came up at Aska in Ganjam district during the British era, the sweet vendors of Ganjam decided to use sugar to prepare the sweets replacing traditional jaggery. Today, the desi ghee used in preparation of the muan has been replaced by refined oil and people are also using dry coconuts, nuts and cherry to decorate it.It is during the Pausa month that on an average one tonne of muan is prepared daily. However, with the increasing price of sugar, cashew nuts and other ingredients for the muan, the price of muan has been hiked this year.According to Budha, a sweetmeat trader at Mayuree Towers in the city, the price of ordinary muan with groundnuts is Rs 180 to Rs 200 per kg while that prepared of desi ghee, cherry and cashewnuts costs Rs 240 to Rs 300per kg."

(File | AP)NEW YORK: Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent will step down from that role next year and be succeeded by the company's No. 2 executive, at a time when people are drinking less sugary soda including its flagship Coke drink.Chief Operating Officer James Quincey, long expected to become the next CEO, will take over leadership of the world's largest beverage maker on May 1, the company said Friday. Kent will remain as chairman of the board.Quincey, who's worked at Coca-Cola for about two decades, has led its drive to cut down the sugar in its drinks and said Friday that he'll continue to do that as CEO. He also said he'll keep pushing for more low-calorie beverages and for offering soda in smaller cans and bottles.He said he wants to ""stay relevant"" with customers by continuing to ""digitize"" the business, selling Coca-Cola's drinks online, through food delivery companies and any other platform customers go to in the future.""The iPhone didn't exist when Muhtar became CEO,"" Quincey said.The Atlanta-based company has been diversifying its drinks to try to adapt to changing tastes. U.S. sales volume for regular Coke is down 14 percent over the past decade, according to the industry tracker Beverage Digest, while Diet Coke's volume is down 29 percent.So last year Coca-Cola rolled out nationwide a milk drink called Fairlife that it said had more protein and less sugar than regular milk. It has also invested in options like bottled teas that have bigger growth potential.Despite the changes, Coca-Cola's annual revenue has fallen in the past four years and Wall Street analysts expect revenue for the current year to fall about 5 percent from the year before. In October, the Atlanta company said its third-quarter profit fell 28 percent.Quincey, 51, spent much of his career with the company in Latin America and was named president and chief operating officer last year. Wall Street analysts said they had expected Quincey to be promoted to the top job, but some thought it would be announced early next year.Analysts at Stifel said ""job one"" for Quincey is to improve revenue growth. Shares of The Coca-Cola Co. rose $1.06, or 2.6 percent, to $42.04 in afternoon trading Friday.Kent, 64, will continue as chairman of the board after he steps down as CEO. He has been CEO for more than eight years and first joined the company nearly 40 years ago.Coca-Cola is the second beverage company to announce a CEO change in the past several days. Last week, Starbucks Corp. said Howard Schultz will step down as CEO next year and stay on as the coffee chain's executive chairman.Change is also coming to Coca-Cola's board. It had said Thursday that Howard Buffett, the son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, would retire from the board and not seek re-election next year. Analysts at Bernstein were concerned it could signal that Warren Buffett, whose holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is Coca-Cola's largest shareholder, could sell Coke stock.Warren Buffett didn't mention his stake Friday but said he was pleased with the CEO succession plans.""I know James and like him,"" Buffett said in a statement, ""and believe the company has made a smart investment in its future with his selection."""

In a chat with City Express, she shares her journey and the challenges she struggles with in her profession.In 1978, Silva moved to India from Italy. She says, A close friend of mine in Kodaikanal was breeding her own race horses. I was unhappy with those jockeys. I then took it upon myself to be the jockey of those horses during races.The biggest challenge, she says that she faced, while starting out was that no one believed a woman jockey can be as good as a man.Racing and equestrian are among the few sports where women and men compete equally. This is a male dominated field and not many great women riders get their break in the Classics (one of the oldest and most important English horse races). Julie Krone was one of these great ones. To be honest, it was always amazing to win. As a woman, we get double the attention and praise than a man... but then you must win.She had many memorable moments in her career. She shares, My first derby was a touching one. I was in Hyderabad. The crowd of 30,000 people gave a standing ovation and everyone was so crazy happy. My horse Brown Sugar had injured himself in the last 200 m of the race and he still managed to win, staving off the other horses, she says.She enjoys other equestrian activities such as dressage, jumping and eventing.The bond with the horse is called horsemanship, and this is what will enable you to understand and communicate with your horse at a much deeper level, she explainsThis deeper level of communication will allow you to get that little extra out of your horse while competing at every level, be it racing or equestrian. The horse which taught me most was Prodigal Son, a retired race horse, that lived with me for 20 years. She learnt a lot from the horses during the intial years of her career, she says.This director of Embassy International Riding School says there isnt a lot of scope for horse jockeying in Bengaluru. This is because there is no jockey school or fruitful opportunity in this city. The best would be putting yourself through a school abroad and getting yourself qualified as a jockey and return to India. Following this, you can establish your credentials there.She feels that an equestrian career is better suited in India for a woman. Instructors are in demand and good salaries are being offered, she says."

Jalarams Farsanwala, with its first Bengaluru outlet in Basveshwarnagar, just does that.Farsan in Gujarati means snacks and are eaten with almost every meal in a Gujaratis house. Hence the name Farsanwala. This joint promises premium snacks that are not expensive, says Raakesh Rajpopat, co-founder of Jalarams Farsanwala.There are few places in the city that serve a fusion of Gujarati and Marwari food, but none are authentic, says Raakesh who has outlets across different cities such as Mumbai and Ahmedabad.Farsanwala has a variety of sweets. There is mohanthal made from gram flour, ghee, milk and dry fruits; churma ladoo with wheat flour, jaggery, coconut and sesame seeds; kutchi peda that is a hard, roasted peda from khoya and dry fruits; gulab pak that is khoya cooked with rose petals; and sata, a thick maida puri like a donut with a sugar glaze. They also have the regulars  motichoor ladoo, Bengali sweets and, the ever popular, kaju barfi.In savouries they have 20 you can pick from. There is papdi that is deep fried wheat crackers seasoned with cumin seeds; farali chivda, a mixture that is usually had while fasting because it is made with potatoes and gathiya, again fries made from gram flour and condiments.They also stock up about nine varieties of baked khakra. So it is all healthy.Talking about its uniqueness, Rajpopat says At Farsanwala, we serve the most authentic Gujarati food in the whole city. The fafdas (fries from gram flour and seasoning) that we serve are just like what you would get in Gujarat on a Sunday morning. All their chefs are from Gujarat.If you are at the store, you must try the ghugra (deep-fried sweets with a stuffing of coconut, cardomom and nuts), dabeli (toasted pav sandwich with coconut, fruits and potatoes) and fafda jalebi.Other than this, they have twenty different kinds of farsan such as kutchi dabeli, kutchi ghoogra, Mumbai vada pav, undhiyu, khandvi and dhokla.On Sundays, they add specials too. We have Undhiyu (a Gujarati special vegetable made during the Sankranti festival) one day and Dal Pakwaan, the next, and somedays both. Currently, for the Shravan month, we have sabudana vada, sabudana khichdi and farali khakra, which people prefer during the fasting session.They plan to add chaats in time, including pav bhaji, pani puri and dahi puri. But that will come in a little later, says Rajpopat.Rajpopat says, A lot of people said that we were located a little away from the centre of the city... in Basveshwarnagar. But, it is the closest hub for the Gujarati community. About 70-80% of our customers are old time Gujaratis who have been in Bengaluru for 30 years or more."

For as long as I can remember, Ive loved helping my mother in daily chores thus learning different household methods of treating ingredients in many diverse ways. A few simple analogies I made as a kid was how fascinating it was to eat the same food around the globe with simple change in the method of cooking & adding local fusions to authentic dishes. To name some; Baingan Bharta was known as Baba Ganoush to Arabics, Roti/ Paratha was known as Pizza to Italian, Clay Pot Tandoors being used in many North Indian regions had transformed to conventional oven in other parts of world.I have done both - gone to college and travelled the world. It has been always fun and very rewarding experience.My journey as a chef had started long before I was certified as a professional. My expedition in Grand Cayman, Cayman Island, has garnered me to the many varied cuisines. Being a tropical region most of the culinary art evolved around fruits and root vegetables. This local lady, Francis, who worked as maid to one of the North African migrant would cook for the family and had adopted their palette. She also worked as a housekeeper in my resort. It was one of the encounters I had with her where I had come across a very unique way of making hummus out of sweet potato. The twist to the recipe was she would pit roast the sweet potato on a BBQ griddle and once the potatoes are charred she would wrap it in a foil paper and leave it on the slow fired griddle till the potato is cooked through. The potato has a smoky flavour which is mellowed with tahini, garlic, dash of sesame oil and chopped habanero peppers. The sweetness from potato, bitter rich creamy sesame paste and spiciness from the peppers was a firework of flavours.I learnt the recipe from her but even after trying a couple of times I was not so impressed with the final product. This one day I had made Francis taste it. The trick was to puncture holes in the potatoes after they are wrapped in foil, this is where I had gone wrong all this while. While the potatoes rest on the griddle, the holes ooze out sugar and water which is caramelized adding a unique flavour from BBQ smoke, sugar, water and trapped steam.Experimenting over half a dozen of times, I have mastered the recipe, now I can even make it in my sleep!! The guests have loved it, the ones who had tried the same hummus elsewhere would brag about how unique the taste and texture was. I had called it Sweet Francis Potato Hummus, for the name I have nearly explained this journey of recipe to nearly everyone I have served it to.Chef Ajay Thakur, Brand Chef, Mirah Hospitality."

You could be turning them into junk food addicts.The increasing footfall of tourists in Bandipur, Mudumalai and other forest reserves in Karnataka seems to be affecting animals in the wild. Simians apart, even deer, peacocks and civet cats have become addicted to junk food. This could prove detrimental to their wildlife, say experts.Both Bandipur and Mudumalai parks, which are contiguous and see a record number of visitors every weekend, have been witnessing cliques of bonnet macaques, rhesus and langurs relishing Coke, fruit juices and chips. Right from 6am to 7pm, one can see people throwing junk food packets to animals here.Naveen Kumar, Chamarajnagar wildlife warden, says, It was bonnet macaques which took to food offered by people. A few nights ago, I saw a civet cat, a nocturnal animal, licking a chips packet. This is an alarming development as there is a big change in food consumption pattern which is not only undesirable but also an example of change in animal instincts.Junk food has sugar additives that are non-nutritious and may not only harm the animals but also bring in behavioural changes in their young ones, he says.As one traverses the Bandipur-Mudumalai stretch, one can see monkeys begging for food from travellers (as seen in the picture). They seem to have lost the natural instinct of hunting. One can even see peacocks and deer wanting such food despite being timid in nature.A naturalist who visits the park frequently says, Unfortunately, people throw any kind of food the moment they see monkeys. Apart from this, there is also frequent wildlife fatalities caused by speeding vehicles.One concerned visitor to the park says, We saw people in the parking area feeding monkeys. There is no control on the rubbish and plastic waste that is dumped here.Heeralal, director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve says, We have been advising people not to feed wild animals and so we mount strict vigil at certain points from the check posts to stop such activities. At the reception counter itself, our staff educates visitors not to feed animals. We have also been conducting awareness campaigns to educate people not to feed simians.Dr Manilal Valliyate, Director of Veterinary Affairs, PeTA India, says, With junk food containing excessive amount of fat, salt, sugar, carbonates and other additives, it will have deleterious effect on their digestive system adapted to natural food. Animals will become prone to gastro-intestinal disorders, develop ulcers and other secondary complications which may result in fatalities. Procuring food so easily and coming into such close contact with humans will lead to psychological stress, competition for food, marked behavioural changes and finally conflict issues."

Here’s a Healthy Alternative,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2016/dec/26/is-your-diet-soda-causing-heart-attack-heres-a-healthy-alternative-1553237.html,2016-12-26,"It tastes just like the original soda, has zero calories, and you can even drink more than one a day without worrying about the calories! Sounds too good to be true! But is diet soda really good for us? No, not really. In fact, several studies say that drinking anything with artificial sweeteners can make you gain weight in the long run, as it confuses the bodys functioning of being able to manage calories while tasting something sweet. It may also get you to overeat, and besides that research has also linked several other health problems including heart attack, with drinking diet soda.Research done at the University of Miami and Columbia University says that drinking diet soda daily is likely to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. So, for a healthier you, it is a good idea, to shift over to some healthier alternatives. Here are some healthier, low-calorie thirst-quenchers, sure to satisfy your taste buds.Flavor it upOpt for naturally flavored water made at home rather than the store bought one which may again include sugar or artificial sweeteners. All you have to do is get a big pitcher of water and just add few slices of your preferred fruits or even veggies to the water. Get creative and customize your drink with lemons, mint and oranges in the water, or cucumber, mint and lime, the list can be endless. Particular concoctions even make for a great detox drink.Just make sure the water you are using is completely safe. If you are unsure about your water quality, then you can always invest in a water purifier online. While buying a water purifier online, its best to be sure about the quality.Henceit is safer to opt for renowned brandssuch as Kent. You could even add small pieces of fruit with water to an ice cube tray and freeze them. Add your fruit cubes to water for a refreshing drink.Drink your nutrientsNatural cold pressed juices seem to be popping up everywhere nowadays. Health freaks seem to love their daily smoothie or vegetable juice, giving them an instant energy boost each morning. It is a great alternative to drinking your nutrients and your requirement of veggies per day in a quick and easy way. It is also an excellent way to maintain your weight or achieve your diet goals, without compromising on your nutrients.Make your fresh juice at home with a cold pressed juicer or use a blender for making a smoothie. All you need to do while using a cold pressed juicer is simply add your favorite veggies and fruits to the juicer (with little or no chopping). So, go ahead and drink your nutrients for a leaner and fitter body.Go organic with your teaUnlike diet soda, organic teas have awesome health benefits! Have a cup of green tea which is also a great antioxidant. According to several types of research regular drinking of green tea might help reduce the risk of numerous health problems and diseases. It is calorie-free, and you can pick any flavor you enjoy, as it is available in many varieties.If you arent fond of the taste of green tea, maybe herbal teas might be worth a try. One can drink these tea variants hot or iced. While most prefer it plain, you could even add a few drops of honey if you want to make it sweet.Bubbly drink mixesIf you want the fizz but not the fat, then replace your diet soda with sparkling or seltzer water, easily available at most groceries. Just add a slice of lemon or any other citrus fruit you like, to add a bit of flavor to the drink. Add a few drops of liquid Stevia to sweeten your drink, or maybe a few sprinkles of salt to get an added flavor. It can be your healthier version of the store-boughtcitrus- flavored soda. Use the Stevia sparingly, as a little goes a long way. If you are short of time, then few grocery stores might even keep drink mixes sweetened with Stevia, which you can easily combine into your usual or seltzer water and enjoy."

Thus, it would be a double whammy of increased import bill in dollar terms and on top of it, higher landed cost on account of weaker rupee,"" he added.The industry association also said the play-out of the November 8 demonetisation measure remains to be seen in terms of impact on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), while uncertainty over implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has increased.""Thus, however much we in the industry might like to see lowering of interest rates, the macro picture may make it a difficult proposition"", it said.In a surprise move earlier in December, the RBI kept its key lending rate unchanged, citing global and local uncertainties.The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), during its second bi-monthly monetary policy review -- the fifth of the fiscal -- kept the repurchase rate, or the short-term lending rate it charges on borrowings by commercial banks, unchanged at 6.25 per cent.According to the panel, its decision to keep the key lending rates unchanged was taken after considering various global and local factors, such as a likely hike in the US interest rates.Commenting on the move, Kanoria said, ""A cut in interest rate would not have made much of difference to the credit offtake in the midst of the industry being over-leveraged and the consumer demand remaining tepid because of scrapping of high-value currency notes."""

The cracked edges of the lips, the peeling skin and the dryness that gets worse as you keep licking them with your tongue.The onslaught of the dry and chilly winds mean that we need to take extra care of our lips, as much as we do for our skin. Keeping a lip balm handy is not the only solution; sometimes when your lips are extra dry and cracking, you need a multi-pronged approach to keep them satiated. Drinking a good amount of water, shuffling your professional lip balm with remedies like butter or ghee, and keeping your tongue in check are critical elements of lip care. Interestingly, a quick lip augmenting procedure with hyaluronic acid based fillers like Juvederm can give you dual benefits- of redefining your lips and keeping them hydrated in the chilly winter.Unlike the skin which has oil glands to keep the oil content balanced, there are no oil glands under our lips. This makes them more vulnerable and susceptible to drying. Neither do they have hair to protect from the environmental onslaught, unlike skin. Lips are also located within the reach of the tongue and our habit to lick them up at regular intervals also dries them out. Another problem associated with lips is that of discoloration or dark patches. This sometimes happens during a phase of ill health or because of regular smoking. Yet another factor that contributes to lips darkening is exposure to UV radiation.Keeping it smoothDrink water: You know that your skin needs hydration and that happens best with the intake of enough water. The same goes for lips. Though people drink enough water in summers, this intake decreases in winters because we do not sweat in the cold season and feel thirsty.Hold your tongue: Most of us have a habit of licking our lips now and then with our tongue. This tendency increases whenever the lips feel dry and stretched. You need moisture to keep them soft and hydrated and saliva comes handy for this. But, this proves counter-productive and dries away the lips more.Avoid Vitamin B Deficiency: Insufficient consumption of Vitamin B not only affects your digestive systems functioning but it also affects the health of the lips. The lips and the corners of the mouth get cracked and deficiency of vitamin B can also cause ulcers in the mouth.Lip augmentation cum hydration procedure: For people who have thin lips and desire a pronounced appearance, dermal fillers like Juvederm are very effective. When administered into the lips, the hyaluronic acid based fillers give volume to the lips, and give them more definition.The hydrophilic gel also promotes water retention and provides hydration to dry and chapped lips. The effect lasts up to six to nine months.Smoking is Bad for Lips Too: If its health implications are not enough a reason for you t quit, give it up for your lips. It causes the lips to become dry and dark. Chain smokers and chain coffee drinkers usually tend to have dark lips. If not for general health reasons, cut down your dependence on caffeine and smoke for improving lip appearance.Scrub: While we all know the benefits of scrubbing our skin, we are hardly aware that the same benefits hold good for lips too. To keep the lips fresh and healthy, it can help to use a scrub on them occasionally. This will clear away the dead cells and make the lips more receptive to moisturizing agents. You can use a mixture of sugar powder and olive oil or honey to gently scrub away dead cells.Facial Aethtic Expert, Bangalore."

The delay in making payments by sugar factories and the state governments failure to fix state advised price for sugarcane have added to their woes.The state has 67 sugar factories that need 5 crore tonnes of sugarcane - Mysuru, Mandya and Chamarajnagar alone have seven sugar factories. The sugarcane production in the state which was 4.40 crore tonnes during 2013-14 and 3.60 crore during 2014-15, may go down to less than 3 crore tonnes this season. Sources said sugarcane cultivation area has come down in Belagavi and Bagalkot region too.The Irrigation Consultative Committee meetings held at KRS and Kabini achukat have decided to release water from the reservoirs, asking farmers to grow semi-dry crops. This has further shattered the hopes of sugarcane growers who began cultivating paddy in the past 10 days. Though a few private sugar factories have volunteered to encourage farmers to grow sugarcane and offered crop loans, the farmers who had bitter experience with the factories, are not keen on growing sugarcane.They say there will not be water to save their crops. A dip in sugarcane production will further delay the opening of MySugar factory in Mandya that has been closed for the past two years for renovation.Gopal of Allagere in Mandya said sugar prices will further shoot up in the coming months as there will be a fall in sugar production. He said as there is not much water in KRS, farmers have decided to stick to paddy cultivation. State Sugarcane Growers Association president Kurbur Shanthakumar admitted there is a decline in the area of sugarcane cultivation in the state, particularly in Cauvery basin.He said the Association that has held a series of agitations to get arrears of farmers has declared crop holiday this year.We are educating farmers not to grow sugarcane due to increase in the cost of cultivation. They suffered losses due to various factors. I am happy the farmers have understood it, he added.It is unfortunate the state government that failed to fix SAP for sugarcane for last year and help them get `470 crore arrears has given licences to 22 factories, he said.Srinath, a cane grower, said the governments failure to fix SAP and get their dues cleared have made them to set up their own jaggery units to crush cane and make best quality jaggery that will be in high demand in the coming days."

Skin problems can be either the cause or symptoms of Diabetes. Dr. Sanjoy Paul, Apollo Sugar helps us identify the top 10 skin afflictions that are linked to diabetes.Heres what you need to look out for -Acanthosis Nigricans: This condition mostly strikes overweight people and usually is a prologue to diabetes (considered to be a marker for the disease). It results in darker, thicker and velvety skin; predominately on skin folding areas such as sides of the neck, armpits and groin and sometimes on hands, knees and elbows.Diabetic Dermopathy: Diabetes causes this condition in which changes occur in the blood vessels supplying to the skin. It is also termed as shin spots and appears to be light brown, shiny and scaly - round or oval patches/lesion of thin skin over the front lower parts of the legs. They do not hurt, itch or burn and often confused for age spots.Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum: Condition is a more complex version of diabetic dermopathy most likely occurring in adult women. A shiny scar with a violet border appears where the blood vessels under the skin may become easily visible. They sometimes turn to be itchy and painful with the spots cracking open in few cases.Eruptive Xanthomatosis: This condition is caused by intensive diabetes and results in firm & yellow pea-like bump in the skin with an itchy red halo; occurring commonly on the rear of the hands, feet, arms, legs and buttocks. People with high cholesterol and fat especially young type 1 diabetic men are the most likely subjects.Vitiligo: Similar in looks to albinism, this condition occurs upon the destruction of color pigmentation producing cells melanin, and appears as irregular and blotchy patches on the Hand, face or chest.Diabetic blisters (bullosis diabeticorum): Caused by intensive diabetes, they look as sores or burn blisters which are painless and occur on the fingers, hands, toes, feet, legs, or forearms. They easily heal on their own in about three weeks.Digital Sclerosis: This condition in prevalent in about one third diabetics wherein one develops tight, thick and waxy skin on their hands, toes and forearm. This also results in stiffness in the fingers, knees, ankles, or elbows.Disseminated granuloma annulare: These are skin deformities which are sharply defined - ring or arc-shaped bumps on the skin most common in the fingers and ear lobes. They are usually red, red-brown, or skin colored.Always keep your skin pampered, nourished and in check! Any unwanted or deformity - consult your nearest doctor!
