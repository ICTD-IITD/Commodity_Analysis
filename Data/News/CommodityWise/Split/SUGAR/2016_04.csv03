(File | Reuters)NEW DELHI: Wholesale inflation eased for the third straight month as it fell to 3.15 per cent in November after subdued demand due to demonetisation led to softening of prices of vegetables and other kitchen staples.The wholesale price index-based inflation, reflecting the annual rate of price rise, in October stood at 3.39 per cent. In November 2015, the print was (-)2.04 per cent.WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)24.10 per cent in November, saw deflationary pressure for the third consecutive month. This was helped by a substantial price fall in onions, which stood at (-)51.51 per cent.Pulse inflation continued to rule high at 21.73 per cent in November, according to commerce ministry data.Potato recorded maximum inflationary pressure at 36.97 per cent. Inflation in fruits rose to 2.45 per cent during the month.Overall, the food inflation basket showed moderation with inflation at 1.54 per cent in November as against 4.34 per cent in October.The reading for manufactured articles was 3.20 per cent compared with 2.67 per cent in the previous month. The corresponding figure for sugar came in at 31.76 per cent and that of petrol 5.54 per cent.The WPI inflation for September has been revised upwards at 3.8 per cent against the provisional estimate of 3.57 per cent.The decline in wholesale inflation coincides with a fall in retail inflation, which hit a two-year low of 3.63 per cent in November.The monetary policy committee headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel had earlier this month held interest rates steady and said demonetisation of high value currency notes could lower prices of perishables and reduce CPI inflation by 10-15 basis points by December.Even as RBI maintained 5 per cent inflation target for March 2017, it trimmed GDP growth forecast to 7.1 per cent, from 7.6 per cent, for the current fiscal."

They have also been asked to prepare a list of faculty members who are aged above 40.A copy of the circular, which is available with Express, reads: All the government colleges that come under the purview of the Collegiate Education Department where the faculty members, physical education teachers and librarians, who have crossed 40 years, must undergo routine health check-ups once a year and submit a copy of the report to the department, and also to the auditor general of the state.However, there is no mention about why the department is insisting on the health check-up. A department official said, It is to create health consciousness among the faculty members. H Kusuma, director, Department of Collegiate Education, There are instances where a few lecturers have died of heart attacks in classrooms. Many also have high/low blood pressure, sugar complaints and other health complications. But only a few are aware of their health condition. Hence, we have issued this circular mandating them to undergo health check-ups.However, it is not just about that. One can also obtain other benefits from the government such as reimbursements for health expenses.Prof Eshwar Reddy, president of the Bangalore University College Teachers Council of Management said, Not all are ignorant of their health. But this circular mandating health check-up will hopefully increase consciousness about health among teachers.Over 6,000 lecturers are working with the department."

A vast platter that it is, the food encompasses from countries touching the Mediterranean Sea and hence we have food from places like Lebanon, Gibraltar, Barcelona, Sicily, Sardinia to Rhodes. The olive planations is what is common other than the presence of the sea. Its not often in one place does one savour a sumptuous spread of this cuisine. But at the food festival curated by chef Sarabjeet Singh Walia at Radisson Blu, Banjara Hills we got refreshing delights that took us on a tasting trip to the region. The promotion will be on till September 29. Charges: `2,500 + taxes.The food tasting began with a platter of cold dips with pitta bread. We tried Baba Ghanoush, Hummus, Tahini, Tabbouleh accompanied by Fattoush.The egg plant tasted really well in Baba Ghanoush and even those who didnt like the vegetable much took a second helping of the dip. In hot starters we loved the Samboosek, a shortcrust pastry filled with minced meat and pine-nuts. What made this Middle Eastern snack taste magical was the use of cheese, though the same is made without cheese. Other than Shawarma pockets the bite-sized pizza coins tasted crunchy and balanced with the use of traditional herbs.For the main course Paella and Cabbage Dolmas with Peppered Cous Cous were nicely done. We liked Imam Baildi. No its not the name of any cleric with a rosary. Its a dish of scooped eggplants filled with a mixture of legumes, oregano and basil. Do try the desserts platter complete with Baklava, Basbousa and Lab-E-Shireen. Usually Baklava is served as diamond shaped cut pastries, but chef Sarabjeet used phyllo puffs filled with crisp nuts, honey and crumbs. The dessert was not overly sweet but balanced the way sugar was used."

Each flavour of yogurt at this international brand is said to be made with cows milk, treated naturally with strains of probiotic cultures.Once you pick your flavours, you move to the next section of toppings with more than 30 choices. Next, are the sauces that you can add to your yoghurt. There are chocolate, caramel sauces and also nutella, if youd like some.As a pure chocolate lover, I tried several chocolate flavours like chocolate cake, cookies and cream, chocolate cookie and topped them with oats granula, choco chips and dry grapes. To top it all, I tried some chocolate sauce as well. Unlike the usual chocolate ice creams which are heavy and filling, the frozen yogurt was very light and delicate. It tasted just like ice creams. You could barely tell any difference. It is indeed a good and healthier option than ice creams.There are even options for diabetics and also those who may be lactose intolerant. While the former can try the sugar free coffee flavour, the sorbets could be a good option for the latter. The flavours at the store are changed every week so that customers get to try something new every time.When you make your own frozen ice cream, do not forget to add Boba. These are chewy little transparent balls that pop in your mouth. If you are trying it for the first time, it can be a pleasant surprise. It may seem weird at first but its fun and will bring back the memories from your childhood. Remember one of your favourite candies during school days - the Magic Pops!While you enjoy your frozen yogurt, you can also play some games at the store and engage in other activities. Test your skills at darting on a dart board or enjoy live music performances hosted by the store on certain weekends.Despite the high quality, an experience at Mencheis is light on the pocket. Primarily due to the stores mix, weigh and pay concept. It costs just `1 per gram and allows one to control their expenditure."

Many denizens in the city wrap themselves in their woollens and head to the Old City. The delicious gourmet itinerary, of course, leads them to the bowlfuls of nalli nihari, paaya, marag, and kaleji gurda washed down with piping hot Irani Chai.What is common about these comfort winter food items is that they are all made from juicy mutton/beef chunks or succulent chicken. But what about those who, by choice or not by choice, are hard-core vegetarians? Do they have a choice? Well, if you are a vegetarian and want to beat the winter chills we bring to you the list of delights that are prepared only with veg ingredients and keep you equally warm as would a liver pie do. Read on to mark the same in your winter bucket list:Classic Cheese LasagnaThis one dish can never fail you. Thick cheese layered with lasagna sheets and a whole gamut of other finger-licking ingredients like cherry tomatoes, button mushrooms, zucchini, bell peppers and, of course, marble onions. What actually keeps you warm is the use of basil and oregano - the herbs known for their unique warmth-providing properties. A dig into the sinful layers and you feel comforted immediately - the rich taste stays with you till you head to bed. Recommended places: 10D, Deli9 and Autumn Leaf Cafe.Date palm halwaRich in nutrients and a handful of these desert fruits ensures that your energy levels remain high during the day. Sweet in itself, the fruit when cooked, doesnt need any sugar in it. Preparation of halwa just needs a box of fresh juicy date palms de-seeded and cooked on slow flame in milk. The result is a smooth mixture dark like winter night itself. A few spoonfuls with a glass of milk provides warmth enough to beat the chill.Mewa laddooWell, ask your grandmother and shell tell you the tales of mortal and pestle crushing those ochre coloured nuts into a granular powder that would be mixed with sugar, some ghee and translucent chunks of fried edible gum. The result - globules of warmth. Have two of these laddoos in the morning and you are set to take off your jacket even if the weathermans chill wind prediction comes true. Almond House is the best place to get a boxful.Beetroot RisottoFaint scarlet with that mix of fresh herbs - this is a must-try. The richness of seasonal vegetables paired with goat cheese makes this dish winter essential bringing to you the feel of balmy Italian afternoons. You can relish beetroot risotto at Tuscany, Trident Hyderabad with champagne or white wine. Shares chef Manik, Such foods are real comforters even if they are prepared with vegetables.

The taste stays with you as does the craving. What better way to satisfy your dripping tongue than to wear your coat and go to the nearest patisserie or that sweet shop to grab those plates of waffl es with blueberry jam and dollops of cream or just savour those nolun gurer rasgullas with the hint of fresh jaggery which keeps the human body warm. As the days get cooler, the body craves for food that can be stored in the tissues to be utilised when the days are much sunnier. Well, while you curl more in your chair we bring to you the list of a few desserts that will fi ll you with delicious warmth, of course, if you try cooking these in your own balmy kitchen:Date Palm HalwaThe tree is known as sacred and is said to connect to heaven. Rich in nutrients and a handful of these desert fruits ensure that your energy levels remain high during the day. Sweet in itself, the fruit when cooked doesnt need any sugar in it. Preparation of halwa needs a box of fresh juicy date palms de-seeded and cooked on slow fl ame in milk. The result is a velvet mixture dark like wild honey. A small bowl with a glass of milk is enough to keep you warm.Andey Ka HalwaWell, the Chinese mythology propounds that the universe began as an egg  this food item with its marble white shell is of course universal when it comes to breakfast. Break a dozen of this elliptical wonder into a pan and whisk till it turns to froth. Add sugar, milk and a few spoonfuls of ghee and put the mixture on the low fl ame. It needs to be continuously stirred with a wooden ladle till it thickens turning into a fresh yellow mixture. Add cardamom powder and a handful of nuts and relish the warmth fl owing in your body in each spoonful. Closer to this halwa is Andey Ka Lauz that food blogger Arundati Rao lists as a lesser-known recipe. Its cooked on slow fi re and with a lot of labour.Beetroot HalwaYes you heard it right. Its the grated beetroot thats cooked in thick creamy milk. The mixture simmers over fi re slowly for a good number of minutes that thickens to a pulpy consistency. A handful of nuts like pistachios, almonds, hazel nuts, walnuts, cashew nuts and few green raisins add to that crunchy nuttiness we all relish. Beetroot is the offspring of darkness beneath earth and gives that royal ruby colour when cooked on its own. It takes to a light sheen when a few spoonfuls of sugar is added. You can store this delight for a day or two. Though simple, this dessert isnt easily available. You can savour it at Taj Falaknuma Palace Hyderabad where the chefs call it by the fancy Persian name Urusa which means bride.Jaggery kheerThe goodness of the poor cousin of sugar has the delicious taste quite reminiscent of rural India that author Premchand shaped up his stories with. Not just used in Bengali rasgullas during winter, jaggery gives the humble sparrow of desserts kheer a unique taste that lasts for months. The trick is simple sugar is replaced with jaggery and the milk dessert is cooked slowly on fi re till one gets the desired consistency. Try it at home and your family will love you for it."

Opposition leader in the Legislative Council K S Eshwarappa and Opposition leader in the Assembly Jagadish Shettar have threatened to disrupt the House if Sait doesnt step down from ministry.JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy is now keen on expanding his partys base in North Karnataka and is likely to raise major issues of North Karnataka region including Mahadayi row, plight of sugarcane growers and also about the prevailing drought that has resulted in farmer suicides.Though Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has visited the drought-affected districts, nothing concrete has been done to waive farm loans. No initiative has been taken to boost the morale of the farming community.Also, the opposition is not happy with the governments decision of fixing `2,300 for per tonne sugar cane as they had pressed for `3,000 per tonne. The sugarcane growers have also planned to lay siege to Suvarna Vidhana Soudha to bring pressure on the government.The BJP, that has strongly opposed Tipu jayanti celebrations, has given an indication that it will corner the government on RSS workers murders in Bengaluru, Mysuru and other places and the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. They will also put up a united show against the proposed steel flyover in Bengaluru.However, if the opposition BJP raises the sleazegate issue, the government may take them on by citing Halappas case, then minister Renukacharyas issue and also about the three ministers who were caught watching porn in the Assembly.The ruling Congress could also target BJP over Janardhana Reddys daughters big fat wedding, which is supposed to have cost around `250 crore, in the light of Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation of high-value currency to nail those with black money.When contacted, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said that the government wants to give time to debate problems related to North Karnataka region and will also move a few important Bills.However, the government is fully prepared to take on the opposition parties, particularly BJP, which has planned to blow up a few issues for political gains, he said. The Congress may turn the tables on BJP for failure of the Mahadayi talks as the Goa Chief Minister, who is from BJP, has not given Karnataka time for talks to resolve the issue."

58fd893d7be9e012bf282fc2,When the Thai kitchen blooms,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2016/sep/17/When-the-Thai-kitchen-blooms-1520648.html,2016-09-17,"HYDERABAD: When I visited Thailand, top on my agenda was to see a live demonstration of vegetable and fruit carving. Having acquired a bit of proficiency in this art (I was taught by some experts when I lived in Delhi and later by an Indian lady who lived in Thailand earlier), I was all the more keen on watching the Thai do it. This Thai art is a venerable tradition that has been passed down from ancient times. Considered one of the ten traditional Thai crafts, it is used in making food offerings for monks, entertaining guests, ordinations, weddings and royal funerals.My gracious hosts (the hotel staff) at Banyan Tree- Phuket arranged for me an elaborate carving session. The young chef John Lee was waiting for me at the appointed hour, loaded with all the paraphernalia and some already carved beauties. He had a basket full of flowers, all made from fruits and vegetables. It reminded me of my own creations, but neither the craft nor the finesse can ever be compared. I am not born with that kind of talent nor do I have that kind of expertise which he was exposed to. As John started working on a watermelon, he narrated the history of vegetable carving.It started during the Loi Kratong festival in the 14th century. This festival takes place on the full moon evening in November when the Thai people send their Krathongs (floating lamps or rafts) floating down a river, canal, pond, or lake, to pay respect to the spirits of the water. In the year 1364, one of King Phra Ruangs servants, Nang Noppamart created a unique decoration for her raft: she carved a flower from a vegetable using a real flower as a pattern. She carved a bird as well and set it beside the flower.Using these carvings, she created a raft that stood out above the rest. King Phra Ruang was impressed by the grace and beauty of the carving and decreed that every woman should learn this new art.As time passed, enthusiasm for this art waxed and waned. In 1808, King Rama II loved vegetable carving so much so that he wrote poetry about it. However, during the 1932 revolution in Thailand, appreciation for vegetable carving died down.In order to revive interest, now it is taught from the age of 11 in primary schools through secondary school, and optional courses are also offered in universities throughout the country. In the mid 20th Century, the art of vegetable carving began to spread outside Thailand. Since then other cultures have slowly come to appreciate the beauty and culture associated with the practice. The products of vegetable carving are generally flowers or birds; however, the only limit is ones imagination.The techniques of the art vary from person to person, as does the final result. Some carvings present more artistic detail, while others have simple, yet beautiful shapes. It is generally used as a garnish as well as a flower arrangement.It has been said that the artistry of food preparation touches the five basic senses: hearing, sight, smell, taste and touch. Visual appeal is perhaps sensed first, and that leads to the enjoyment that comes from employing the other senses. Visual presentations are often brought to a high artistic level in sugar, chocolate, ice, vegetable and fruit carvings.When working with sugar and chocolate, there are chemistry aspects to be considered and special tools to be mastered. This is also the case with ice carving, with the addition of the physical strength required. Among these mediums, vegetable and fruit carving is the least complicated. Fruit carving requires few tools-often just a small paring knife. It can be done simply and quickly for production, or taken to another level with more time and training.It is one of the mainstays of buffet presentations on cruise ships and in hotels and resorts, as well as in clubs. Even though many carvings are made with just a paring knife, there are specific toolkits that contain from six pieces at the basic level to 87 cutting pieces used by expert carvers. Certain fruits, such as papayas, canary melons, watermelons and Chinese melons, lend themselves well to carving, but almost any fruit can be carved into something beautiful.By the time John finished the story, a beautiful pink flower emerged from the unromantic, fat watermelon. As his deft fingers played with a simple paring knife, I wondered at the sensitive and aesthetic art that lies innate in every Thai. It shows in their calm demeanour, soft speech and gentle manners. Of course, the smile is always a bonus that is thrown in!John held the flower, gazing at his creation while I clicked pictures in full admiration of his love and dedication to art. He wiped the paring knife ever so gently, kissed it and put it away carefully in his pocket.Madam, this knife is my everything and very dear to me he said in way of explanation. Yes, I could understand and appreciate.(The author is a travel writer and a documentary filmmaker focusing on art, culture and history)"

So I do not expect a freefall in the euro in the near term,"" said Minori Uchida, chief currency analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.""But in the long run, this will delay progress in Italy's efforts to get rid of banks' bad debt and is likely to widen the yield spread of German Bunts and the Italian bonds,"" he added.The euro slid as much as 2.1 percent to 118.71 yen, but pared some of the losses to trade down 0.9 percent at 120.08 yen.The dollar was supported by expectations of a U.S. rate increase this month and gained 0.2 percent to 113.78 yen.The dollar index,, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, jumped 0.6 percent to 101.44.The New Zealand dollar slipped 0.8 percent to $0.7074 after Prime Minister John Key unexpectedly announced his resignation on Monday, saying it was the ""right time"" to leave politics.Key, a former foreign exchange dealer who worked at firms including Merrill Lynch, won office for the National Party in 2008, ending the nine-year rule of Labours Helen Clark.New Zealand stocks extended losses to trade 0.6 percent lower.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.3 percent, while E-mini futures for the S&P 500 narrowed losses to 0.2 percent.Japan's Nikkei slid 0.5 percent.While the long-awaited opening of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect went live on Monday, global risk aversion weighed on China's and Hong Kong's main indices.China's CSI 300 index tumbled 1.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed earlier losses to trade flat.The link between China's booming Shenzhen stock market and neighbouring Hong Kong allows foreign investors first-time access to some of the fastest growing technology companies in the world's second-biggest economy.Back in Europe, dealers said Italian bonds were set to come under pressure as top-rated U.S. Treasuries and German bunds gained. Futures for U.S. 10-year Treasury notes added 5 ticks.Investors and Europe's politicians fear victory for the opposition 'No' camp could cause political instability and renewed turmoil for Italy's banking sector, which has been hit by fears over its huge exposure to bad loans built up during years of economic downturn.Renzi's resignation represents a fresh blow to the European Union, the euro zone's heavily indebted third-largest economy which is struggling to overcome a raft of crises""For markets, the risks posed by Italys 'no' vote are about the potential for political instability and the possibility of an election in Italy rather than with any missed opportunity for long term constitutional reform,"" Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, wrote in a note.""The real concern for markets is whether this situation may ultimately lead to election of the Five Star Movement whose policy is to hold a referendum on whether Italy should remain in the Eurozone.""Analysts at RBCCM argued that, based on what happened in 2012 at the height of the Greek crisis, such a risk could see the euro trade as low as $0.8000.""It may sound extreme, but if a second euro zone crisis were to hit, with the U.S. dollar at a much stronger starting point, EUR/USD could arguably trade lower still,"" they wrote.Markets had earlier taken some encouragement when Austria's far-right presidential candidate was soundly defeated by a pro-European contender, confounding forecasts of a tight election.The European Central Bank also meets Thursday amid much speculation it will announce a six month extension of its asset buying program and widen the type of bonds it can purchase.""There has been some speculation that the ECB would step and front load purchases of Italian bonds if markets became unsettled by a 'No' result, so perhaps it is the thoughts of a central bank liquidity sugar pill driving things again,"" said ANZ economist Jo Masters.OIL PULLS BACKWall Street ended last week on a cautious note, with the Dow off 0.11 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 0.04 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.09 percent.While Friday's U.S. payroll report was firm enough to cement expectations of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve this month, a surprise pullback in wages helped bonds pare a little of their recent losses.In commodity markets, oil ran into risk aversion and some profit-taking after boasting its best week in at least five years following OPEC's decision to cut crude output.Markets are now focused on the implementation and impact of OPEC's first output cuts since 2008, to be joined by Russia and possibly other non-OPEC producers.

I am still in disbelief, she says, as she sits down for this interview.This 13-year-old girl from Kalyan Nagar is among the 20 children selected from all over the world to present a talk at the TED-Ed to be held on November 3 at TED headquarters in New York City.TED is a global conference, started in 1984, where an individual is given 18 minutes to present an idea engagingly. TED-Ed, an offshoot, is a platform for teachers and students. At the event, Esha will be speaking on the power of questions and how the understanding of a question is subjective.Margaret Sullivan from TED group confirms that Esha is to speak at the next event on December 3. She was invited after the TED-Ed Team saw the video of her TED-Ed Club talk, says Sullivan.My mother had said, lets keep this as a surprise till November and I had agreed... But the next day I started receiving calls from all my relatives. My mother had told everyone, she says, rolling her eyes and trying not to laugh. Esha says she is thankful to everyone who supported her but gives a little extra thank you to Sreeja.Sreeja Iyer, a graduate of Havard School of Education, is Eshas after-school teacher.Sreeja runs a pre-school and an after-school called Sparkling Mindz that follows a Reggio Emilia system of education. Reggio Emilia believes in a hundred-language approach that involves painting, sculpting, music, etc., for a childs development. Esha goes to CMR school and is currently in class 8, and she has been attending Sreejas after-school for the past four years. The TED-Ed video, done two years ago and through which she was selected, was an assignment with Sparkling Mindz.Her talk, How I Chased my Dream And Learned, is a mix of her plans of becoming a master chef and her philosophy of life. In it, she shares a memory of her first attempt at cooking, she made a dessert with cocoa powder, baking powder and sugar but she didnt bake it. It didnt taste right, she says, but her first attempt taught her many things, the primary being not to be a quitter.Esha is still surprised that her video which she feels could have been better landed her on the international stage. I dont hate my talk but I cannot be in the same room if somebody is watching the video, Esha says.Her mother Rakhee Prabhudesai, while enrolling Esha at Sreejas institute four years ago, had said, She is a very shy kid. Please do something. Esha says, I know I wouldnt have been able to do anything had Sreeja not pushed me to do it. I, in fact, had no intention of being a part of TED-Ed club since I am very lazy and always think I am not good enough. Had Sreeja not persuaded me of putting on that little extra effort I wouldve still been holding a piece of paper that reads no-confidence.Aishwarya Chodankar from Mumbai who is in class 12 is another Indian selected among the 20 to talk at the TED-Ed weekend. Esha and Aishwarya are already in touch through e-mails."

He is insulin-dependent. At Jnana Sanjeevini Medical Centre in JP Nagar, he sits obediently with his 25-year-old mother Shilpa N on a Saturday afternoon for his routine checkup. He has to be administered insulin four times a day, and Shilpa and her husband, who reside on KR Road, cannot afford two bottles of insulin every day.They have a small pani puri shop to sustain their family of four. For thirty years now, Jnana Sanjeevini Medical Centre of the Samatvam Trust has been a go-to place for poor diabetics who cant afford the rich mans disease. The centre provides free insulin to children and medicines to adults. It has provided scholarships to children from school to college, around 40 of them. The centre is run by Dr S Srikanta who is a researcher in the field of endocrinology. He has been faculty at the Harvard Medical School and clinical investigator of National Institute of Health, USA.A month of diabetes medication requires at least `4,000, provided there are no complications. Diabetics are prone to heart, kidney and eye problems. Those with severe diabetic foot also have to undergo amputations. To prevent this, Srikanta has trained around 18 community health workers who go around Ramanagara district to diagnose diabetes and either ask them to go to a primary health centre or visit Jnana Sanjeevini.Dr Srikanta has touched the lives of one lakh families in the past three decades. The rural project is called Madhura Sanjeevini. These 18 barefoot doctors arent even educated let alone have rudimentary medical education. But they do know that blood glucose levels between 100 and 125 when fasting is bordering diabetes and needs changes in lifestyle or medical intervention.They are armed with a kit with essentials to diagnose diabetes  sugar meter, weighing scale, and a mobile with a software loaded on it. When it indicates green, they know that the blood glucose is normal. When it shows yellow, they understand that the levels are worrisome and advise people on exercise or changes in diet, etc. When it reflects red they know that the levels are more than 125 on fasting blood and that they need to see a doctor, says Dr Srikanta.Everyone reports to Rathnamma Srinivas. They maintain a register of their attendance and the houses theyve covered. One thing that binds all of them is that someone in their family is a diabetic and has suffered the implications of it. So far they have screened at least 2,900 citizens.One-third of the patients who come to our centre pay, another one-third get subsidised treatment and one-third dont pay, says Dr Srikanta. Building the four-storeyed charity structure wasnt easy. Their benefactors include the GC Surana family of Micro Labs, Sarojini Damodaran Foundation, Infosys Foundation, Biocon Foundation, Sahayata Trust and other institutional and individual donors.Srikantas dream, however, is to take healthcare to the doorstep of the urban poor and rural poor. Everyone should learn how to diagnose diabetes, from the office clerk to a doctor, he says."

Here veggies and meat are cooked with authentic Chettinad spices.You can start your meal with the chef recommended soups. Try the Murunga Keerai Thakkali Rasam. Cooked to perfect thick consistency, the tomato flavour drumstick leaf soup is creamy and delectable. The drumstick leaves lace the spicy soup with a bitter taste.The Chettinad cuisine served here offers a wide variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. For starters, there are Palkatti Chukka, Kaikari Kola Urundai, Chettinadu Egg Roast, Chicken Leg Roast and Kuvepoo Kara Varuval.Palkatti Chukka is batter-fried paneer cubes tossed in Chettinad masala. The crunchy cubes are served along with generous amount of lightly fried curry leaves and shallots. The Kaikari Kola Urundai are fried balls of minced vegetables coated with bread crumbs. They are laced with Chettinad spices. Boiled egg is fried crispy for Chettinadu Egg Roast. They taste zesty.The Chicken Leg Roast is tawa roasted. The sounf-flavoured chicken drumsticks are juicy. Marinated with spices, the drumsticks are pan fried. This crunchy appetiser has a blend of ground masala and curry leaves. The Kuvepoo Kara Varuval has some crispy fried cauliflower florets tossed in Chettinad spices. Though the name suggests Kara, meaning spicy, it is not spicy at all.All the preparations are garnished with curry leaves lending them a strong aroma and flavour to the food. Though the Chettinad cuisines are believed to be spicy and rich, these food preparations are made less spicy, customised to the taste of the Bengalureans. Though, towards the end, everything tastes the same.For the main course, there is the Chicken Biryani and Veg Biryani. Both look appetising and colourful but, on tasting, the dish is mediocre. The chicken pieces in the biryani are bland. The Kothu Parota is a better option with tangy and moist tomatoes and caramelised onions.The desserts are the best. The uniqueness of every dessert surprises you and The Attipaza Halwa, prepared with fig, is served warm. It has a mild sweetness and the jelly-like fig halwa leaves you craving for more.The Jil Jil Jigarthanda reminds you of falooda. The cold sweetened-milk is served with nannari syrup, basil seeds and ice cream. The Paruthi Pal, made of jaggery is like the jack fruit payasam, but it is milk prepared with cotton seeds, spices and herbs. The Chakkara Appam is shallow fried dumplings dipped in ghee and soaked in sugar syrup. It is an answer to every sugar craving.The Pal Kozakattai is steamed rice dumplings served in sweet milk and with shredded pista and badam"

The train halted at Hassan, and after a sumptuous breakfast, we left in the luxury coach, to the Vindyagiri Hill.After climbing 680 steps (the steps were small and easy to climb) we saw the enormous statue of Gomateshwara, also called Bahubali ( I mean, the original one: for those who are much used to the Telugu mega film starring Prabhas, this may come as a surprise!!). At 57 feet, it is considered worlds largest monolithic stone statue. Once in twelve years, thousands of devotees congregate here to perform the Mahamastakabhisheka, a spectacular ceremony in which the gigantic statue is bathed in milk, curds, ghee, saffron, sandal paste and gold coins.The next such event will be held in 2018. Bahubali was known for the immense strength of his arm: Bahu meaning arm and bali meaning strength. His story exemplifies the inner strength of the Indian philosophy. Though he defeated his brother in the fight for power, he gave up the kingdom and all the worldly pleasures to become an ascetic. Bahubali is considered an ideal man who conquered selfishness, jealousy, pride and anger. Belonging to the Digambara sect, Bahubali was the first human in this half time cycle to attain liberation.Providing the best of comforts, the Mapple group ensured that we enjoyed every moment of our stay. On board there was entertainment like tambola, henna session, cookery demonstration, Bollywood dance, etc., something to look forward to, everyday.Close to Hassan are the two famous tourist destinations, Belur and Halebidu. We visited both of them and saw some of the finest sculpture in India. Halebidu was the 12th century capital of the Hoysalas. There are two Hindu temples in the complex, Hoysaleswara and Kedareswara and two Jain places of worship. The temple walls are covered with an endless variety of depictions from the Hindu mythology, animals, birds and Shilabalikas or dancing figurines.No two sculptures of the temple are the same in the Hoysaleswara temple. Guarded by a monolithic Nandi, it was never completed despite 86 years of labour. Invaded twice by the Bahmani sultanate, many sculptures are disfigured by Malik Kafur and his armies. There was a dance floor on which Queen Shantala used to make her dance offerings to the deity in front of the sanctum sanctorum.Just 16 kms away is the equally beautiful Belur temple. It was built by king Vishnuvardhana in commemoration of his victory over the Cholas. It is believed to have taken 103 years to complete. The facade of the temple is filled with intricate sculptures and friezes. Inside the temple there are a number of ornate pillars. Darpana Sundari  ( lady with the mirror) on the outer wall of the temple is a very famous and beautiful sculpture, that is much admired. Jakkanachari, a sculptor is said to have carved most of the sculptures in the temple.Lunches and dinners were much looked forward to, by all the guests. Prepared by dedicated staff, in the clean kitchens, our eating expeditions on the Golden Chariot were as exciting as the historical ones. For dieters too, they would take special orders and cook food to specifications, like fat free, gluten free, sugar free, etc.Going back in history, looking at all the architectural wonders and sculptural beauties, I felt proud of my country and its heritage.Especially, when foreigners used to admire the works, my heart would swell with pride. Many of them are in love with India and made a number of visits already. But in many of these temples, the idols are missing, plundered by the Muslim invaders. Beautiful statues without arms or legs and some with disfigured faces used to gape at us, making a sad picture. From the Hoysala kingdom, the Golden Chariot then moved majestically to the Vijaya Nagar Empire.........Fordetails: http://www.goldenchariot.org/"

The latter is an annual campaign with the goal of stimulating and supporting practical actions that will help people achieve and maintain a healthy weight, while and reverse the global obesity crisis. The former, however, is a movement that began closer to home, vociferously campaigned by health and fitness venture VLCC, and focusing more on it as a pandemic crisis.While obesity does not discriminate, the Global Nutrition Report conducted this year assessed that a growing rate of overweight persons in the country prevailed, resulting in high risk of diabetes and heart diseases in the country. Incidentally, India has also been ranked high on malnourishment, paving way for extreme results based on the Body Mass Index (BMI) of most of the population. Women, particularly in south India, are the ones battling obesity more than men. City Express tries to find out what ails the population and why it continues.India is recognised as a potpourri of all kinds of food. Travel a 100 kilometres in any direction and you get varying cuisines from area to area. Some are fried to the point they drip oil after every bite, while others are filled with masalas and spices. Basing this as one of the reasons, Dr Anbhezhil Subbarayan, an endocrinologist with Apollo Hospitals, believes that while the food in the country maybe delicious and tempting, a balanced intake is the need of the hour. Food with fat and sugar tastes so much better and people tend to go with that, without thinking much about the health hazards. Its difficult to keep your intake in check if the food is so good, he opines. Carbohydrates are consumed more in south Indian cuisine too. You cannot say that obesity isnt rampant in rural areas, but it happens due to the lifestyle in cities. The amount of calories you burn and the amount of calories you take in has to be balanced. Its easy to say that you eat less but its not the same when you talk about the food you have actually consumed, he adds.Dietitians and experts from VLCC Wellness Centre notice a pattern of why women fall prey to obesity more here. Southern states in India have better socio-economic indicators than other states. In these states, female education is comparatively higher. Moreover, the proportion of women living below the poverty line is comparatively less in the south than the northern or eastern regions in India. So, having a favourable environment in these states, women can have a sedentary lifestyle which may further lead to overweight, adds an expert.But singling out food as the sole reason would seem unfair. Dr Shashikala, consultant diabetologist from Venkataeswara Hospitals, brings to light other possible reasons that we usually miss out on. Food and lifestyle are factors, but so are hormones. With more fast food and oily foods now, lifestyles have changed drastically. Invariably, now youll find most of the women suffering from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), she avers. She also adds that the menstrual cycle gets irregular, resulting in weight gain.Bearing this in mind, doctors however, vouch that there is hope. While physical exercises such as going to gyms is an option, there are many who arent aware of a simple technique called NEAT - Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis, says Subbarayan. These are the little things you can do to counter obesity, especially when you have no time. For example, when you are reading a book, you can read it standing or walking around. Or if you have the option of using the lift or staircase, opt for the latter. Instead of relying on help, try doing your own day-to-day to activities such as washing, sweeping etc. These small little things go a long way and if you do it regularly, it makes a huge difference in the future, he adds."

Senior doctors who spoke at the 68th annual conference of the Cardiological Society of India suggest initiating steps to reduce air pollution across the country to reduce heart and lung diseases.According to Dr Dorairaj Prabhakaran, executive director, Centre of Chronic Disease Control, Delhi, heart disease was showing an alarming increase in India and urbanisation has played a role in this trend. All over India air pollution is higher than the standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO), said Dorairaj. Efforts have to be made to reduce air pollution to reduce heart and lung diseases. Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) has launched an initiative named Geo Health Hub to reduce pollution.He said practising yoga could be effective for cardiac rehabilitation of heart patients.There is an ongoing study looking at the benefits of yoga in returning patients to their normal lives after a bypass or treatment for heart attack. Dorairaj further said treatment of high BP, sugar and cholesterol can be done by the general doctors at the primary level itself. The government has decided to launch a programme to train the primary doctors at district level to treat these risk factors of heart diseases. He said 17 million man hours will be lost due to heart diseases by 2030 if preventive measures are not taken. World Heart Foundation former president Dr Salim Yusuf said cardiac illness is one of the major causes of deaths in our country. The number of cardiac patients in Kerala is three times more than the national average. People should reduce carbohydrates and include more fruits in daily diet, said Yusuf. The four-day conference ended on Monday."

But sugarcane growers, who are unhappy with this, are threatening to picket Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belagavi during the winter session.Speaking to reporters after a meeting with sugarcane growers on Tuesday, Minister for Cooperation and Sugar H S Mahadev Prasad said that in accordance with National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) guidelines, they fixed the price at a minimum of Rs 2,300. Considering the low yield of sugarcane, we expect the price to increase. Once the price of sugar increases, we will take steps to ensure that the profits are passed on to farmers, he said.The farmers are demanding a minimum of Rs 3,200 per tonne. Prasad said that five factories had agreed to pay the farmers the profits on the byproducts, but farmers were suspicious about this. I am getting a report from the committee formed of farmers, sugarcane factory owners and experts and will then take a decision, he said.Around 39 factories have already started processing sugarcane. Of the remaining 25, work will begin at 21 of them. About 300 lakh tonnes of sugarcane is expected to arrive in factories this year. This is expected to produce around 30.90 lakh tonnes of sugar.Close on the heels of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah writing to the Centre on the impact of demonetisation, Prasad said he will also be writing to the Centre to make it easier for cooperative banks to disburse loans and allow cooperative banks to operate like commercial banks.At present, cooperative banks are dependent on commercial banks for their cash requirements. While they require Rs 500 crore for banking transactions, they also require another Rs 600 crore for loan disbursal. However, only Rs 25 crore has been released to them in the last seven days. Cooperative banks have over seven lakh customers, including farmers."

Examining the eyes is an easy way for doctors to have a look at the vascular system and the network of blood vessels in the body which includes the arteries and veins. With an examination, an ophthalmologist can spot silver or copper coloured arteries which can signal high blood pressure, a red flag signaling symptoms of cardio vascular disease.Experiencing blurred vision, strain in the eyes when working or acute headache are common reasons when one would visit an eye expert. But these could also be symptoms of hypertension. It occurs when ones blood pressure is abnormally high and this can be detected by observing the blood vessels in the retina which begin to narrow down. When blood pressure is high (hypertension), the retina may get damaged due to its effect on the retinal blood vessels. This could also lead to progressive loss or blurring of vision in the long term if not treated on time.Sometimes, one may experience a sudden and painless loss of vision in one or both eyes, temporarily. This condition known as Amaurosis fugax occurs due to atherosclerosis and carotid artery blocks requiring urgent cardiac evaluation and intervention as these are symptoms of carotid artery disease. Carotid Artery Disease is a cardio vascular disease occurring due to build up of wax or plaque in the carotid arteries, restricting blood flow. These arteries supply blood to the brain, scalp, neck and face.Diabetic retinopathy, a diabetic eye disease, occurs due to high blood sugar levels which damage retinal blood vessels and affect vision. The signs are blood spots and leaking blood vessels. Patients diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy are prone to cardio vascular diseases like Ischemic heart disease. This condition is characterized by fat deposits in coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, hence preventing proper blood flow along with signs like heart palpitations, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath and chest pain.Dr Raghu Nagraju, Consultant, DrAgarwals Eye Hospital"

Among these, one out of six diabetics is being diagnosed with retinopathy. Unless detected at an early stage, more diabetics will become fully blind within 10 years, he added.Early detection is necessary and that needs to be followed by early treatment. So when physicians detect diabetes, they should also look for the complications that will arise with diabetes and provide the related care, Dr Rao said.Prof GVS Murthy, director, IIPH pointed that prevalence of diabetes had gone up by five times in the last 25 years due to rapid change in lifestyle.Also, with no communicable diseases spreading at the same pace as in the past, the longevity of life has gone up. The longer you live, the more chances are that you will be diagnosed with diseases like diabetes, said Prof Murthy. He went on to explain that people diagnosed with diabetes should refrain from tinkering with medication.People stop allopathic medication and get sub-optimal medicines from an untrained physician. We are not against alternative medicine, but it should come from a certified doctor, he elaborated.People also increase dosage of insulin or take additional tablets if they are going to a party, he added. It doesnt work that way. You need to take it along with a meal for it to be balanced. If it is delayed, by the time it acts, it can lead to hyperglycemia or very low sugar level, he said.Rao also said that people bring alternative medicines and ask him if they can be replaced with the medicine he prescribes. The Indian Council of Medical Research nor the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has approved any indigenous medicines for the treatment of diabetes and hence we do not approve, added Dr Rao."

So when you prepare those pancakes or halwa you know what you have to do. Stop, at least for this week and eat those ripe seasonal fruits like apples, oranges, custard apples. Drink a lot of water.Try drinking aloe vera juice early in the morning and avoid eating fried and spicy food. Say no to any sugar product. Says Anju Majeed, senior scientist, Sami Labs: Fructose leads to insulin resistance, a condition wherein insulin cannot breakdown blood sugar.She lists the ill-effects of fructose. When we eat small amounts of fructose and follow it up with a workout, it will be used to make glycogen (stored glucose) in the liver.Failing which, fructose is converted to undesirable fat. Fructose lowers HDL cholesterol (commonly referred to as good cholesterol) and increases the density of LDL (bad) cholesterol. It produces a dopamine response which leads to reduction in Serotonin receptors in turn leading to depression and anxiety. The ability of the human body to absorb fructose is limited.Hence consumption of higher quantities of fructose leads to bowel disturbances.So, post Diwali replace your sweets with fruits and live a healthy life. Check out our two smoothie recipes listed below. Say cheers to yourself. Nothing can be sweeter than that."

Thats how we have Moplah Food Festival happening at Aish, The Park which will be on till November 20.So what exactly is the new fetish about Moplah food? Its a region of North Kerala dominated by Muslim population who trace their roots to the Arabs as the latter came to the region for the trade of spices and silk. Talk about spices and the same reflects in the cuisine. Chef Abida Rasheed speaks amiably dropping abundant portions on our plates asking the stewards to bring more warm food. There was not command in her tone but affection that reflects in the dishes she so lovingly cooks. We enjoyed eating Mutton Ishtew that had the desired consistency, neither gooey nor sticky  just the right thickness that you can relish with Kerala Parota. The potatoes were succulent and dissolved with the curry, the mutton pieces were juicy and soft. The green coriander leaves just added the ghar ka khana bit. Food needs to be cooked in clay pots as the same give breathing space to your food which keeps your food fresh for a longer time, said the chef.Its not just clay pots that do the wonder, the use of ghee gives the food its own deliciously different taste thats how the mutton biryani she cooked turned out to be really different from what we eat in Hyderabad, Calcutta or Lucknow. The rice used wasnt the long-grained biryani rice, instead the grains were smaller and better known as Khaima rice. She describes, Earlier this rice used to grow in valleys and as the wind blew the crop became more fragrant. It cooks really well giving the biryani its unique texture.We relished Kozhi Nirachathu, pot roasted chicken with deep-fried onion gravy that had that subtle sweet flavour. Begum Abida added, We use spring chickens that dont weigh more than 400 gms. The bones of these chickens give that special flavour and taste to the curry.And not just these dishes there are a variety to be relished such as: Meen Porichattu, Vada with thenga manga chutney, Kadala Kari, Parupu Kari and more. It was the dessert which amazed us. The egg yolk and white had been separated and cooked differently. The egg white was steamed with sugar, while the yolk was whisked and dropped in loops in hot boiling sugar syrup which gave it noodle like shape and consistency. It was topped on the sweet steamed white. Any guesses for the name? Its that famous Mutta Mala people associated Moplah cuisine with.Price: `999 all inclusive for lunch and `1,495 all inclusive for dinner."

Thousands of soldiers and state security agents saluted the remains as they rolled slowly out of Havana's Plaza of the Revolution and the cortege made its way to the Malecon seaside boulevard and east into the countryside.Tens of thousands of people lined the route, which retraces in reverse the path of the triumphant march of Castro and his rebels across the island to enter Havana on Jan. 1, 1959. Many waved flags and shouted ""Long may he live!""Others filmed the procession with cellphones, a luxury prohibited in Cuba until an ailing Castro gave up power in 2006 to his younger brother, Raul, who began a series of slow reforms.The ashes were to arrive late Wednesday in the central city of Santa Clara, where they would spend the night at a memorial to fellow revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, whose remains are interred in Santa Clara.An enormous Cuban flag hung outside the memorial to Guevara and hundreds of soldiers and city residents turned out for the arrival.""He is everything to me. He's the one who gave us everything,"" said Cristian Garcia, a 13-year-old who painted the words ""I love you Fidel"" on his face.The second leg of the journey on Thursday is to take the ashes to the eastern city of Camaguey. They will be interred Sunday in the far-eastern city of Santiago, ending a nine-day period of mourning that saw Cuba fall silent as thousands paid tribute to photographs of Fidel Castro and sign oaths of loyalty to his socialist, single-party system across the country on Monday and Tuesday.Wednesday's procession was the first moment in which ordinary Cubans saw the remains of the man who led a band of bearded young fighters out of the Sierra Maestra mountains, overthrew strongman Fulgencio Batista, faced off against the United States for decades and imposed Soviet-style communism on the largest island in the Caribbean.For many Cubans, seeing the coffin of a man who dominated life here for a half-century made the idea of a Cuba without Fidel Castro real for the first time since his death Friday night at age 90.Juan Carlos Gonzalez, 26, owner of a private restaurant that serves traditional Cuban food in Santa Clara, said there was a greater sense of uncertainty without Fidel and he couldn't say whether that was positive or negative.""The one who ruled the country was Fidel, in my opinion,"" Gonzalez said. ""Now I don't know how things are going to be.""The crowds along Wednesday's route were a mix of people attending on their own and those sent by the government in groups from their state workplaces.Outside Havana, the caravan passed through rural communities transformed by Castro's social and economic reforms. Many residents now have access to health care and education. But many towns are also in a prolonged economic collapse, the country's once-dominant sugar industry decimated, the sugar mills and plantations gone."

No party, they say, is complete without blotters (blotting papers that carry the chemical hallucinogenic) or ganja.An official at Narcotics Bureau says, Ganja costs around Rs 300 for 30 grams and you can get 10 powerful doses from every gram... The quality of LSD varies, so its price might range between Rs 300 and Rs 600 for one strip (of blotting paper). Students can easily afford these prices in this city.The teenagers that City Express spoke to say users have a party once or twice every week and fun is measured by the substance served and its strength. LSD comes mostly in sugar cubes or on strips of blotting paper.A Class 10 student from Indiranagar says 10 out of his 50 classmates do drugs. They do it four or five times a week. We go to our friends houses when their parents are out, he says.The teenager says he has tried everything. Whitener, LSD, marijuana, hash, heroin and even meth but the best is Molly. Trippiest stuff, man, says the student, candidly.Molly (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) aka Ecstasy is the new rage among Bengalurus adolescents.Another student of Class 10 says his classmates started early: I know many who started when they were in Classes 7 or 8.A Class 12 student says that he has tried to stop his friends and juniors, but no one listens. What can I tell them? My own classmates do it a lot and are deaf to my warnings, he shrugs.What happens when a child is caught abusing drugs? The offenders are kept on a tight leash for a few days. When the parents or teachers loosen their hold, busy with their own routines, the children slip back into their old ways.VV Singh, Superintendent, Narcotics Control Bureau, says they recently nabbed a man, headed for Kuala Lumpur from Kempegowda International Airport, who was carrying 20 grams of Molly and 21 kg of ketamine in food packets.The drugs are supplied from Mumbai and Chennai, says Singh. Foreign residents from Nigeria, South Africa and from East African countries such as Tanzania peddle them.They reach the students through a grassroot network. Local retailers sell them to everyone, including young students, says Singh. We occasionally catch students doing them.Parents are devastated when they learn of their childs addiction, says another official at NCB. It always comes as a surprise. They blame themselves for neglecting the kids, he says.Parents are often busy working and providing for their families, pitches in another official. But they dont know the abysmal state of the children today... school girls from Classes 8 to 12 are being lured by the peddlers. They are introduced to the drugs when someone spikes their drinks, then they become addicts and the peddlers demand sexual favors in return for the drug. All the while, parents are under the impression that their kids are out for combined study with a classmate.Child psychiatrist Jayashree Chakravarthy says, Families are predominantly nuclear these days and parents are unable to spend enough time with their children. There are no elders to guide them or show affection. This causes insecurity in the children and they resort to such desperate measures. Chakravarthy works for the reputed Manasa Hospital in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh.Nagesh Babu, a social worker, says, Parents should ask children to account for the pocket money and only give them enough to meet their needs.The Class 12 student also agrees that guardians must keep a close and consistent watch on the kids. Parents and teachers should keep checking our bags and other possible hiding places, he says.A Class 11 student says stricter laws could help, but that did not work out very well for rape... so, I dont know."

(Photo | AFP)HAVANA: His long-winded political rants were legendary. But Fidel Castro also loved burning the midnight oil, the written word, and, ironically, the sport that unites Cuba and its US foe: baseball.Castro squeezed the maximum out of his 90 years which ended when he died late Friday, getting by on snatched rest, sustained by the passion of his interests and the revolution he nurtured for nearly half a century.""I will never retire from politics, the revolution or the ideas I have,"" Castro said late in his life.Castro's legendary late-nightsmanship was a source of constant comment by journalists, biographers and the bemused.For Castro, it was utterly normal to dine into the wee hours, then hold interviews that stretched on hours as guests slumped over in their chairs.Some of his closest allies and friends said Castro somehow learned to rest while awake, in a sort of active down-time of chatting, swimming or reading, another passion of his.""His devotion to the word is almost magical,"" wrote a personal friend, Colombian Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He said he was convinced that when Castro is ""tired of conversing, he rests by conversing more."" Garcia Marquez died in 2014.- Learning to surf web -Castro thirsted for knowledge, learning late in life to surf the Internet, even as his government controlled access to it.His personal library included books by Ernest Hemingway and texts on hydroponics, or growing plants without soil.There are photos of the day when the only Concorde to visit Havana touched down, and Castro headed to the airport to pepper the pilot with questions about the sleek supersonic jet.The youthful Castro of the 1950s was fabled for incessant cigar smoking. When he stubbed out the habit, he was awarded a prize from the World Health Organization.Something of a gourmand, Castro collected cooking recipes which, according to Garcia Marquez, he liked to prepare ""with a sort of scientific rigor."" In his later years he went on diets, even as many Cubans struggled to put enough food on their own tables.The first papal nuncio during his government, Monsignor Cesare Sacchi, taught him how to make pasta.Maybe because of his high energy, or maybe to work off dinner, Castro was no stranger to the gym and he loved swimming. His great sporting loves, however, were basketball, diving and baseball, Cuba's national sport.An inveterate risk-taker, he did not balk at political and military high stakes.Castro did not take kindly to defeat. When Cuba failed to meet its 1970 sugar harvest target of 10 million tonnes (there were only eight) he urged Cubans to ""turn misfortune into victory.""""In my next incarnation I want to be a writer,"" Castro was once quoted as saying. He wrote many short pieces and editorials but his books are mainly compilations of his speeches."

Eldest daughter Alina Fernandez, born from an affair with a married socialite who remained on the island decades later, blasted dad on exile radio from Miami.The sprawling Castro clan, made larger by Fidel's early extramarital affairs, also suffered from the same sorts of dysfunction and disagreements afflicting so many other families: siblings who don't speak, adults resentful over childhood slights and murky talk of babies born out of wedlock.During Castro's long illness, the tightly wrapped secrecy about his family started unraveling as his youngest sons and their mother, Dalia Soto del Valle, rallied around him.Soto del Valle, a blonde, green-eyed former schoolteacher Castro met during Cuba's literacy campaigns in the 1960s, was his life's most enduring relationship. She was rarely seen in public and never alongside the ""maximum leader"" while he was in power.Together more than four decades, the couple had five sons, now middle-aged. Castro, who took the nom de guerre Alejandro during the revolution, continued his homage to Alexander the Great when naming them: Alexis, Alejandro, Angelito, Alexander and Antonio.None were involved in politics. The best known is Antonio, or Tony. An orthopedic surgeon and former official doctor for the island's national baseball team, he later became vice president of both the Cuban Baseball Federation and the Swiss-based International Baseball Federation.For decades their identities and their mother's were state secrets known only to a small circle of loyalists.So private was Castro about his family life, his marital status with Soto del Valle was unknown in a country where common-law unions are as ubiquitous as legal ones. Some reports said they married in a quiet civil ceremony in 1980.News correspondents on the island had heard whispers about ""la mujer del comandante""  the comandante's woman  but didn't get their first glimpse of her until early 2000 when she joined a huge rally calling for the return of Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy rescued from an inner tube off South Florida. Soto del Valle also made a rare public appearance the following year at the Tropicana nightclub during Cuba's annual international cigar festival.But she wasn't seen publicly alongside Castro until the summer of 2010, when he made a series of appearances after a four-year absence, including his first address to the National Assembly since falling ill.There were also dividing lines in the family tracing back to a custody battle over Fidelito even before Castro toppled Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Those divisions would only grow deeper and more bitter after the revolution, similar to the splintering in untold Cuban families with members on both sides of the Florida Straits.Fidel's first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart, divorced him in the mid-1950s and took Fidelito, born in 1949 as the oldest of at least nine children Castro fathered, to the United States. Castro wanted the 5-year-old kept from Mirta's family, which included her brother Rafael Diaz-Balart, an official in Batista's government. Two of Castro's nephews, Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, later became Florida congressmen who personified exile opposition to his regime.""I refuse even to think that my son may sleep a single night under the same roof sheltering my most repulsive enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those miserable Judases,"" Castro wrote his half-sister, Lidia, in 1956.While in Mexico preparing for the guerrilla war, Castro persuaded Mirta to send Fidelito for a two-week visit, then refused to send him back. Later, as Castro's sisters were taking the boy for a stroll in Mexico City's Chapultepec Park, three armed men jumped from a car and grabbed him to return him to his mother.Even Castro's own childhood in eastern Cuban had its family complications.Patriarch Angel Castro, who immigrated from Spain's Galicia region and established a farmstead in a place called Biran, was still married to his first wife when he started a family with Fidel's mother, Lina Ruz, the family maid.It's unclear what happened to Maria Argota, Angel Castro's first wife, who bore him Lidia and Pedro Emilio. But Angel and Lina ultimately had seven children together, finally marrying in a church after Fidel, their third child, was born.Fidel's older brother Ramon, a lifelong rancher, was occasionally seen in public, and sisters Angela and Emma also remained in Cuba. The youngest sister, Agustina, lived in Mexico many years.Among his own offspring, Fidel only publicly recognized Fidelito, the angel-faced, blond boy from revolution-era photographs who today causes double-takes because he so resembles his father. As an adult he rose to the top post at Cuba's Atomic Energy Commission before his father removed him for unpublicized reasons in the early 1990s.Alina Fernandez was born March 3, 1953, from Castro's love affair with Natalia Revuelta, a dark-haired, green-eyed beauty and cardiologist's wife who became enamored of Castro during his revolutionary struggle.Fernandez left Cuba in 1993 wearing a wig and carrying a fake Spanish passport, later describing her feelings of abandonment in a book, ""Castro's Daughter  An Exile's Memoir of Cuba.""""I wanted him to find a solution to all the shortages: of clothes, of meat,"" wrote Fernandez, who was hired by CNN to provide commentary after her father fell ill in mid-2006.""I also wanted to ask him to give our Christmas back,"" she added, referring to her father's abolition of the holiday so workers could participate in the then-critical sugar harvest.Fernandez's book created a rift even among Castro relatives in exile: Juana filed suit in Spain in 1998 arguing the book defamed her and Fidel's parents. A court ordered the publisher to pay Juana Castro $45,000.Castro fathered at least two more children out of wedlock: Jorge Angel Castro, who remained in Cuba and fathered at least four children of his own, including triplets; and Francisca Pupo, who migrated to the United States with her husband in 1999.Juana Castro has told of meeting Pupo after the younger woman emigrated to the United States with her husband in 1999.Meanwhile Raul's daughter, Mariela, married an Italian businessman and became something of a family rebel by heading Cuba's National Center for Sex Education and speaking out for gay rights, though her activism was later very much within the political mainstream as Cuba became more tolerant of homosexuality.Despite their differences, the Castros still living on the island were said to regularly attend weekend gatherings with outdoor meals and horseback riding hosted by Raul in his role as lead organizer of family events.And as in many families, even the most disaffected set aside resentments during crises. Juana Castro refused to celebrate with other exiles when her brother Fidel had emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006.""In the same way that people are demonstrating and celebrating, I'm showing sadness,"" she told The Associated Press then. ""It's my family. It's my brothers."""

He ended the announcement by shouting the revolutionary slogan: ""Toward victory, always!""Castro's reign over the island-nation 90 miles (145 kilometers) from Florida was marked by the U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis a year later that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. The bearded revolutionary, who survived a crippling U.S. trade embargo as well as dozens, possibly hundreds, of assassination plots, died 10 years after ill health forced him to hand power over to Raul.Castro overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, exile in Mexico and a disastrous start to his rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana in January 1959 to become, at age 32, the youngest leader in Latin America. For decades, he served as an inspiration and source of support to revolutionaries from Latin America to Africa.His commitment to socialism was unwavering, though his power finally began to fade in mid-2006 when a gastrointestinal ailment forced him to hand over the presidency to Raul in 2008, provisionally at first and then permanently. His defiant image lingered long after he gave up his trademark Cohiba cigars for health reasons and his tall frame grew stooped.""Socialism or death"" remained Castro's rallying cry even as Western-style democracy swept the globe and other communist regimes in China and Vietnam embraced capitalism, leaving this island of 11 million people an economically crippled Marxist curiosity.He survived long enough to see Raul Castro negotiate an opening with U.S. President Barack Obama on Dec. 17, 2014, when Washington and Havana announced they would move to restore diplomatic ties for the first time since they were severed in 1961. He cautiously blessed the historic deal with his lifelong enemy in a letter published after a month-long silence.Carlos Rodriguez, 15, was sitting in Havana's Miramar neighborhood when he heard that Fidel Castro had died.""Fidel? Fidel?"" he said as he slapped his head with his hand in shock. ""That's not what I was expecting. One always thought that he would last forever. It doesn't seem true.""""It's a tragedy,"" said 22-year-old nurse Dayan Montalvo. ""We all grew up with him. I feel really hurt by the news that we just heard.""Fidel Castro Ruz was born Aug. 13, 1926, in eastern Cuba's sugar country, where his Spanish immigrant father worked first recruiting labor for U.S. sugar companies and later built up a prosperous plantation of his own.Castro attended Jesuit schools, then the University of Havana, where he received law and social science degrees. His life as a rebel began in 1953 with a reckless attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago. Most of his comrades were killed and Fidel and his brother Raul went to prison.Fidel turned his trial defense into a manifesto that he smuggled out of jail, famously declaring, ""History will absolve me.""Freed under a pardon, Castro fled to Mexico and organized a rebel band that returned in 1956, sailing across the Gulf of Mexico to Cuba on a yacht named Granma. After losing most of his group in a bungled landing, he rallied support in Cuba's eastern Sierra Maestra mountains.Three years later, tens of thousands spilled into the streets of Havana to celebrate Batista's downfall and catch a glimpse of Castro as his rebel caravan arrived in the capital on Jan. 8, 1959.The U.S. was among the first to formally recognize his government, cautiously trusting Castro's early assurances he merely wanted to restore democracy, not install socialism.Within months, Castro was imposing radical economic reforms. Members of the old government went before summary courts, and at least 582 were shot by firing squads over two years. Independent newspapers were closed and in the early years, homosexuals were herded into camps for ""re-education.""In 1964, Castro acknowledged holding 15,000 political prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled, including Castro's daughter Alina Fernandez Revuelta and his younger sister Juana.Still, the revolution thrilled millions in Cuba and across Latin America who saw it as an example of how the seemingly arrogant Yankees could be defied. And many on the island were happy to see the seizure of property of the landed class, the expulsion of American gangsters and the closure of their casinos.Castro's speeches, lasting up to six hours, became the soundtrack of Cuban life and his 269-minute speech to the U.N. General Assembly in 1960 set the world body's record for length that still stood more than five decades later.As Castro moved into the Soviet bloc, Washington began working to oust him, cutting U.S. purchases of sugar, the island's economic mainstay. Castro, in turn, confiscated $1 billion in U.S. assets.The American government imposed a trade embargo, banning virtually all U.S. exports to the island except for food and medicine, and it severed diplomatic ties on Jan. 3, 1961.On April 16 of that year, Castro declared his revolution to be socialist, and the next day, about 1,400 Cuban exiles stormed the beach at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast. But the CIA-backed invasion failed.The debacle forced the U.S. to give up on the idea of invading Cuba, but that didn't stop Washington and Castro's exiled enemies from trying to do him in. By Cuban count, he was the target of more than 630 assassination plots by militant Cuban exiles or the U.S. government.The biggest crisis of the Cold War between Washington and Moscow exploded on Oct. 22, 1962, when President John F. Kennedy announced there were Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba and imposed a naval blockade of the island. Humankind held its breath, and after a tense week of diplomacy, Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev removed them. Never had the world felt so close to nuclear war.Castro cobbled revolutionary groups together into the new Cuban Communist Party, with him as first secretary. Labor unions lost the right to strike. The Catholic Church and other religious institutions were harassed. Neighborhood ""revolutionary defense committees"" kept an eye on everyone.Castro exported revolution to Latin American countries in the 1960s, and dispatched Cuban troops to Africa to fight Western-backed regimes in the 1970s. Over the decades, he sent Cuban doctors abroad to tend to the poor, and gave sanctuary to fugitive Black Panther leaders from the U.S.But the collapse of the Soviet bloc ended billions in preferential trade and subsidies for Cuba, sending its economy into a tailspin. Castro briefly experimented with an opening to foreign capitalists and limited private enterprise.As the end of the Cold War eased global tensions, many Latin American and European countries re-established relations with Cuba. In January 1998, Pope John Paul II visited a nation that had been officially atheist until the early 1990s.Aided by a tourism boom, the economy slowly recovered and Castro steadily reasserted government control, stifling much of the limited free enterprise tolerated during harder times.As flamboyant as he was in public, Castro tried to lead a discreet private life. He and his first wife, Mirta Diaz Balart, had one son before divorcing in 1956. Then, for more than four decades, Castro had a relationship with Dalia Soto del Valle. They had five sons together and were said to have married quietly in 1980.By the time Castro resigned 49 years after his triumphant arrival in Havana, he was the world's longest ruling head of government, aside from monarchs.In retirement, Castro voiced unwavering support as Raul slowly but deliberately enacted sweeping changes to the Marxist system he had built.His longevity allowed the younger brother to consolidate control, perhaps lengthening the revolution well past both men's lives. In February 2013, Raul announced that he would retire as president in 2018 and named newly minted Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel as his successor.""I'll be 90 years old soon,"" Castro said at an April 2016 communist party congress where he made his most extensive public appearance in years. ""Soon I'll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban Communists will remain as proof that on this planet, if one works with fervor and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need and that need to be fought for without ever giving up."""

Jane Ellison obesity was costing Britain's National Health Service (NHS) billions of pounds every year.Campaigners and health experts, however, said the plan was weak.Graham MacGregor, a professor of cardiovascular medicine and chairman of the Action on Sugar campaign group, said it was ""an insulting response"" to Britain's obesity and diabetes crisis which ""will bankrupt the NHS unless something radical is done"".In opting for a sugar tax, Britain joins Belgium, France, Hungary and Mexico, all of which have imposed some form of tax on drinks with added sugar. Scandinavian countries have levied similar taxes for many years.Britain's plans will see a levy applied to drinks with a total sugar content above 5 grams per 100 ml, with a higher band for even more sugary drinks.The government's health department says sugary drinks are the single biggest source of sugar for children, and a child can have more than their recommended daily intake just by drinking a can of cola which contains nine teaspoons of sugar.It wants the industry to work towards a 20 percent cut in products popular with children, with 5 percent in the first year. Progress would be reviewed every six months by the government's health agency, Public Health England.But Gavin Partington, Director General of the British Soft Drinks Association, said the levy was a ""punitive tax"" that would ""cause thousands of job losses and yet fail to have a meaningful impact on levels of obesity"".Sara Petersson, a nutrition analyst at Euromonitor International, said the focus on sugar may detract from other crucial factors in obesity.""It is becoming abundantly clear that replacing a critical ingredient of a product, or single nutrient in a diet, is neither an easy process for food companies nor a successful obesity strategy,"" she said.The program the government intends to launch with funds raised from the sugar levy will focus on promoting healthy diets and physical activity in schoolchildren, Public Health Minister Nicola Blackwood said.She said primary schools would be asked to help pupils get at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. At least 30 minutes of this should be during school time, she said."

Today, were going to take a look at the pinnacle of the series  Mass Effect 2. Lets start by getting a potentially controversial opinion out of the way first of all  the original Mass Effect was a good game, nothing more. It was not life-changing or anything of the sort. Nostalgia ensures that many of its defects are erased from memory, but it had them. Mass Effect 2, however, was what lifted the series from hmm, has potential to greatness.If youre new to the series and dont feel too strongly about starting with the first game, Mass Effect 2 is a pretty good place to start.Featuring a previously on prologue that fleshes out some of the major decisions in the original game, it does a good job of getting you up to speed with current affairs. In no time at all, your Commander Shepard will be strapped in and ready to save the galaxy once again.Continuity is very important in a sequel of this sort, and by and large, Mass Effect 2 handles it with aplomb. Lots of tongue-in-cheek references aside, you get a strong sense of identity and place  your character has existed in this world for years, and youre stepping into the shoes of somebody whos already made more than a few waves in his/her time.What you do in Mass Effect 2 is entirely up to you. Want to play a shining rosy-cheeked beacon of light and goodness and cotton candy spiked with industrial-strength sugar syrup? Go for it! Or the other extreme, or somewhere in between  this is a BioWare RPG, the world is your oyster.Choices are really at the heart of Mass Effect 2, and you sometimes make them when you dont even realise that youre making them. In that respect, it is sort of realistic and the game should be applauded for taking that route. Speaking of things that deserve applause, youve got to admire the chops of a game that basically tells you from the beginning that youre going on a suicide mission and that youre probablygonna die.Im going to diverge from the main topic for a minute if I may  one of my favourite things about the Mass Effect series has always been that you had a ship of your very own. (It helps that, as names go, Normandy is fairly non-dramatic and good  qualities somewhat lacking when it comes to what should I call my starship? in games. For gamers like me who go through RPGs as pack rat, this is just about the greatest thing since Diablos stash.Theres not much more I can say about Mass Effect 2 without talking about the story, which I really shouldnt say anything about  you should play through it yourself. This is a great game, and one you should definitely play.(Arjun is a gamer, book lover and an all-round renaissance man)"

One squeezed a drip and another prepared a plastic syringe. The young boy didn't move. Only the shallow rise and fall of his chest indicated he was still alive.Fluid was injected to try to stabilise the two-year-old's blood sugar levels. ""He's better than he was 20 minutes ago,"" said one doctor. ""But his condition is still critical.""Abdullahi's mother, Hadiza, perched on the end of the bed, as if trying to get as far away as possible from the machines and lines attached to her tiny son. She turned her head and sobbed.All of the children brought to the intensive care unit at the field hospital in the Gwange area of Maiduguri are starving to death because of Boko Haram.Abdullahi's body was swollen from the protein deficiency kwashiorkor. In the next bed lay Hafsat, a 13-month-old girl whose body was little more than skin and bone.""Her mother died five weeks ago,"" explained Hafsat's aunt, Fatima Ladan, holding the girl up. ""I tried to breastfeed her but there wasn't enough milk.""I took her to hospital, where she was given Plumpy'Nut (a high-energy food supplement given for severe acute malnutrition) but she wouldn't take it. Each time she would vomit.""Fourteen-month-old Maryam was born in a camp for the displaced after her family fled an Islamist attack in the town of Baga, in northern Borno state, in January last year.Her grandmother, Hauwa, sat quietly by her bedside.""My wish is for her to recover and get well,"" she said. ""I pray God gives us food to eat.""Echoes of BiafraThere have been repeated warnings about the effects of food shortages caused by the Boko Haram conflict, which has killed at least 20,000 people and left 2.6 million homeless since 2009.But despite the huge numbers involved, the situation has received little attention compared with other humanitarian crises around the world -- even within Nigeria.In July, the United Nations said nearly 250,000 children under five could suffer from severe acute malnutrition this year in Borno state alone and one in five -- some 50,000 -- could die.Last month, the world body said 4.5 million people in three northeast states needed immediate food aid -- double the number in March.Of those, more than 65,000 people were said to be facing famine. But fighting and insecurity has left some hard-to-reach rural areas cut off from help.Dr Bamidele Omotola, a nutrition specialist with the UN children's fund UNICEF, said global acute malnutrition rates were ""far, far, far above what (we find) in an emergency situation"".""I do remember that the last time we had such serious cases was like when we had the Nigerian civil war (from 1967-70),"" he added.Then, more than one million people died from the effects of starvation and disease in a war sparked by the declaration of an independent republic of Biafra in Nigeria's southeast.Now, the fighting has left farmers unable to sow crops, land has been destroyed or mined and water sources contaminated while food shortages have pushed up prices in local markets.At the same time, Nigeria is in recession. The naira currency has lost value and inflation has risen to more than 17 percent, making food, fuel and goods more expensive.'Already too late'Doctors and healthcare workers running feeding programmes in camps for the displaced and at public health clinics across Maiduguri, deal with the consequences every day.Desperately underweight children are weighed and have the circumference of their upper arms measured for signs of malnutrition. Nurses shout out measurements to be recorded.Those too weak to fight complications such as measles, malaria or diarrhoea are referred to the in-patient therapeutic feeding centre in Gwange run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF).The medical charity typically treats children aged between six months to five years old but doctors at the facility said they are seeing increasing numbers younger than that.The 14-bed intensive care unit is ""always full"", they added.MSF said 290 patients were admitted in July and 30 children died due to severe acute malnutrition. In August, the figures jumped to 387 admissions with 72 deaths.""Most of these cases come in very late into the crisis,"" said MSF's emergency medical coordinator in Maiduguri, Dr Javed Ali Baba.""By the time they come here it's already too late. Every day we see two, three deaths.""'Terrible catastrophe'The Boko Haram conflict and its consequences has spilt into northern Cameroon, western Chad, and southeast Niger, leaving 6.3 million people in the region severely food insecure.Of those, some 568,000 children have severe acute malnutrition. As a result, the UN has significantly revised upwards its funding estimates for the rest of this year.The UN regional humanitarian coordinator for the Sahel, Toby Lanzer, said $385 million (345 million euros) more was needed for northeast Nigeria alone.For the region, $559 million is still required.""We are really addressing this as we would any of the most serious crises,"" he told AFP from New York, where UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will launch an appeal for funding on Friday.But with Nigeria in economic crisis, the expectation is for the international community to ""step up"" and provide the resources needed, he said.""The international community will have to do more or we will have a terrible catastrophe on our hands and that doesn't help anybody,"" he added.Back in Gwange, Dr Ali Baba said despite a marked increase in work by the government and aid agencies in recent months, he was expecting no let-up in malnutrition cases.""There are still a lot of people out there who need a lot of help,"" he said. ""I'm pretty sure it will get worse...""From what we have seen over the last two months... I don't think it's going to slow down at any moment from here."""

The elephant must be driven to a higher ground in a bid to rescue it,"" Uddin said.""After seeing her latest conditions, both teams will decide how we can rescue her,"" he added.Uddin said the hundreds of villagers who were flocking to see the elephant were also likely hampering her ability to seek higher ground unaffected by the floods.The wild elephants of India and Bangladesh have dwindled in number in recent decades as their habitat is destroyed.The rescue bid comes days after Indian wildlife officers appealed for help in caring for eight rhino calves pulled from the floodwaters in the northeastern state of Assam.Scores of people die every year from flooding and landslides during the monsoon rains in India and neighbouring Nepal and Bangladesh.So far this year 96 people have died in the worst-hit Indian states of Assam and Bihar."
58fda6d37be9e012bf284e7d,Eyes on diabetes,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2016/nov/14/eyes-on-diabetes-1538540.html,2016-11-14,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Eyes - a pair of spherical bodies contained in a skull cavity - the orbit - well protected on all sides by bones. Your eyes are the doorway to your heart, you can express emotions, share feelings and even convey moods with just a look. And there is something that connects them with diabetes.World Diabetes Day (WDD is celebrated around the world on November 14th since 1991, the day remembered as the birthday of Frederic Banting, who discovered and extracted insulin from the animal pancreas in 1921 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1922. Each year there is a theme chosen for WDD and in 2016, the theme is Eyes on Diabetes.The most common diseases affecting the eye in diabetic patients are cataract (whitening of lens), glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure) and retinopathy. Although DM can increase the prevalence of cataract and glaucoma, the main culprit of retinopathy is DM. DM is the leading cause of blindness. Mainly there are 4 types of diabetes - insulin dependent diabetes (Type 1), non insulin dependent adult onset diabetes (Type 2 ), gestational diabetes (in pregnancy) and drug induced diabetes.There are 415 million adult Type 2 DM (25-79 years) patients in the world and more than 50 lakhs of Type I DM. More than 5.4 million DM patients die per year globally.Twenty one million women develop DM during pregnancy per year. Seven hundred billion US dollars are spent for diabetic care per year globally. Twelve percent of the global expenditure on health is being spent for diabetic patients.One third of diabetic patients develop retinopathy in their life time. Eye involvement depends on the duration of diabetes, the control of diabetes and associated co-morbid conditions like hypertension, and dyslipidaemia (high cholesterol). Retinopathy is involvement of the retina, (the inner layer of the eye ball).There are global as well as country specific guidelines for choosing the appropriate therapy. Early insulin initiation, choosing therapies based on individualized parameters avoiding hypoglycemia, cheaper oral therapy in low resource settings are proven strategies to prevent the extensive rise of cost of treating DM and its complications.(Dr K P Poulose is the Principal Consultant in Medicine and a Senior Diabetologist in S U T Hospital, Pattom, Thiruvananthapuram)About retinopathyThere are 2 types of retinopathy - Non proliferative retinopathy (mild) and proliferative (serious) retinopathy. The network of blood vessels that supply the retina become damaged (microvascular disease) in diabetes leading to permanent loss of vision. The disease can be quite advanced before it causes blindness and hence regular screening of eyes in diabetes patients is mandatory at least once in a year for early diagnosis and treatment. In the famous DCCT trial conducted in the 1980s in 1440 Type I patients in USA, it is proven beyond doubt that proper control of blood sugar could reduce retinopathy in 38% of patients."

With around 69 million individuals in India currently diagnosed with diabetics, the once silent epidemic is no longer as quiet as it used to be.While hereditary factors play a role, changing lifestyles and a physically inactive routine have resulted in the number of diabetic patients to rise from 32 million in the year 2000 to 69.1 million in 2015. The age of onset of diabetes and heart attack is coming down significantly from 40-50 years to 30-40 years.Diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. This leads to an increased concentration of glucose in the blood which is known as hyperglycaemia. The complications arise due to the raised blood sugar levels. According to the WHO, 80 per cent of deaths from diabetes-related complications occur in low and middle income countries like India.Over time, the increased levels of glucose in the blood leads to fatty deposits or clots on the insides of blood vessels. These can occur in any vessels but when they occur in the blood vessels of the brain and the heart, they increase the risks of stroke and heart attacks! Studies have shown that when compared to non-diabetics, diabetics are two to four times more at risk for heart attacks.Delayed diagnosis means that many people with type 2 diabetes will suffer from at least one complication by the time they are diagnosed. By recognising and treating diabetes early, we can prevent additional cardiovascular complications through implementation of proper diet, targeted weight loss and healthy lifestyle changes in addition to taking medication as required.High stress due to work-related and other issues, lack of sleep and exercise, smoking habits, unhealthy diet with high trans-fat, salt and sugar are all cited as reasons, and therefore lifestyle modification is crucial.Proper eating habits include chewing the food properly. Chewing slowly and eating leisurely matter.Consulting a doctor at the earliest and seeking treatment will also help avoid serious problems, such as a heart attack or heart failure. So there is no excuse, this World Diabetes Day, lets get our check up done!"

This is why she did not hesitate to take her troup of tiny tots to the old age home at Thiruvankulam during Onam, where she and the children spent time cooking Onasadhya for the old and abandoned. It was a great sharing experience for the children last year. It was touching too since students as young as six-year-old were showing a lot of interest in chopping vegetables for the sadhya. This year, however, I took the kids to a fishermen colony at the heart of Thiruvankulam. There was no road to where these people stay and we had to cut through all the overgrown grass. The children were surprised that people still lived in such inaccessible areas. After spending nearly a day there, the children concluded that we needed to build a house for one family which was living in dire circumstances under a thatched roof. We have received approval from the school principal. The students and myself will begin collecting the fund for the house soon. This is our latest project, she said.These are just two of the innumerable social commitment initiatives Nirmala teacher and her children have been involved in for years. Every few months, they buy clothes, essential items like rice, wheat, sugar and vegetables and gift it to old age homes and orphanages.Apart from this, Nirmala teacher has initiated gift a child programme where children from the school donate items into a box. By the end of the year, these boxes are distributed to children in need. Many of the programmes were part of Young Indians network.However, Nirmala never had it easy. There was a lot of convincing to do because children were involved. Even though it is for a good cause, parents are a bit apprehensive to send their children for activities outside school hours. Some days, I had to personally make visits to these childrens homes. However, I was succesful in taking parents into my confidence and soon my house became the spot for all the charitable activities. I believe that children need a holistic education rather than just studies, says the mother of a ninth grader.For her activities, Nirmala has received a number of accolades including the National Jindal award for best teacher by Shikshan Bharati, award for excellence in teaching by Vidyodaya Institute among others.Nirmala credits her sense of social commitment to her parents who taught her about charity. Her in-laws amd husband have been equally supportive."

As far as I am concerned, neither the umpires nor the match referee ever came to us talking about it. The Daily Mail had alleged Kohli had used a sweet to shine the ball during the first Test at Rajkot. Kumble, though, was not having it. People can allege and write whatever they want, he said.The disdain in his voice was evident as he also defended South Africa skipper Faf Du Plessis, who was last week, charged by the ICC for the same offence. Even for someone like Du Plessis to be told that this is ball tampering or whatever, I think it is very silly. South Africa have played exceptional cricket to beat Australia.Chris Woakes, who in all likelihood will replace Stuart Broad for the third Test which begins here on Saturday, was also asked about ball tampering and he said there was a 'grey area'. Everyone has said they try to shine the ball in a similar fashion (using sweets). I think the fact that Du Plessis has been fined shows that ICC are trying to make a stance but there is I suppose is a grey area. I think it needs to be clarified what exactly the problem is. If you are placing a sweet on the ball that is obviously against the rules, but everything else seems to be a little bit of a grey area. That's our stance and we won't be changing.It looks like there is going to be a clampdown on using sugary saliva to shine the ball but Woakes spoke about Gatorade being a sugary drink. Gatorade has sugar in it. We take those drinks on board and then lick our tongue and put that on the ball. So that's a grey area as well.Nobody really knows for sure but there is bound to be increased scrutiny whenever a player licks his tongue on the field of play now on."

A colonoscopy on July 11 revealed no polyps.Laboratory results show cholesterol well in the normal range (169 with HDL cholesterol at 63, LDL at 94).Other results: triglycerides 61, PSA 0.15, blood pressure 116/70, blood sugar 99, and C Reactive Protein UQ 0.7.Trump's testosterone level is 441.6, also within the normal range.Until now Trump had released only four, gushing paragraphs on his health, written by his doctor Bornstein in December 2015."

Kohli has scored the majority of runs, particularly in that second Test match. So, we are going to have plans to him to try and stop him scoring... Once he gets in, it's hard to get him out.""Despite the humiliating loss, Woakes felt that all was not lost and England have a good chance to bounce back.""I feel that the teams are fairly evenly matched,"" he said, at the same time acknowledging that India was playing in their home conditions.To another question, he said, ""Although we have lost that last Test match, we felt that we have played some good cricket on this tour barring a session maybe"".While pointing out that toss will play a role, he also said, ""We obviously do have to win here to make sure we can win the series..everyone is in good spirits (on team morale after previous loss).""About his own form after being rested in the previous tie, he said he was ""fit and raring to go"".When asked that bowlers always have niggles and if he felt disappointed to miss you given the way he bowled in the first game, Woakes said, ""Yeah, I suppose you always want to play, you don't want to miss any Test match, particularly when you feel you are in decent form and decent nick. Yeah, I suppose its one of those things which happen..""On missing the services of their fast bowling spearhead Stuart Broad, Woakes said, ""Obviously, it will be a huge loss if Stuart doesn't play..he is a world class bowler, he has been there for a long period of time. He has shown how good he is in one spell he bowled, I think it was one of the morning sessions, the last Test match.""When asked if he feels Mohali, traditionally known to favour fast bowlers, is the venue where England can boost their seam attack given, Woakes replied, saying, ""potentially, may be...as you mentioned there has been history here that potentially might help the seamers a little bit better but then same time last year's Test match it was just the opposite.""Woakes fielded a volley of questions surrounding ongoing ""Sweet-Gate"" in context to what happened with the South African team in Australia and also in the ongoing seriesin India.He said he feels there were ""grey areas"" which need to be clarified.Asked about ""sweetgate"" controversy in the series between Australia and South Africa, Woakes replied, ""I think they have said that everyone tries to shine the ball... The fact that (South African skipper) Faf du Plessis has been fined by the ICC..I suppose there is quite a grey area there, isn't there. Hashim Amla said about him having chewing gum in his mouth, pretty much all day. I am not sure if it is deemed wrong, I am not sure. ...it needs to be clarified as to exactly what the problem is.""To another related question, he said, ""We won't change anything that we do, there is camera's always on you, always has been, so there is nothing we need to change.""He also said during drinks break, guys will come and have sweets or mints just to re-energise and freshen up, to keep the energy going.""Nothing more than that..And when you are really tired and the opposition is getting on to you, a lolly does help in boosting energy,"" he said, adding sometimes we take energy drink but he was not sure how much sugar they carry in the mouth, saying it is a grey area.At the same time, he added, ""If the ICC feels that this should be banned and this should not go to pitch, maybe it is the way to do it. We do what we do. We have not been fined or banned, so we would continue to do what we were in the past.""Meanwhile, when asked about his own bowling, Woakes replied, ""we always have to find ways of troubling the batsmen, particularly in these conditions, when generally there is not much help to get that seam movement.""On his own pace, he said pace to world class batsmen, sometimes doesn't matter too much if its not on target, so accuracy is all that important.""I just try to put the ball in the right areas, try to get the side movement and trouble the batsman,"" he said.On the Mohali track, he said, ""whether the pitch will spin on day one, I am not sure, but at some point it is going to spin, we have gone with three on three over the last two Test matches and the wicket doesn't seem to look too different to those.""Asked if he believes Jos Butler has the ability to adapt and do a good job, Woakes said, ""he is a brilliant one-day player. He has obviously showed that, he has been in a good form on this tour from that Bangladesh series, he was probably our best player on that series in similar conditions...everyone knows that Joss is a naturally attacking player."""

But these Indians, who have been given visas are engineers, welders, technicians and IT experts. Are all such experts not available in Pakistan? Either all Pakistanis should be allowed to import workers from India or the Sharifs should be questioned on this? he added.However, he expressed fear that some of them could be Indian spies.It is not written on the forehead of anybody that he is a spy. It wasnt written on Kulbhushan Yadavs forehead that he was a spy. If they are not spies then why have they been exempted from police reporting and why have customs officials not been given permission to search their luggage, he questioned.Qadri declared that in the next episode, he would share the names and passports of other Indians.The PAT chief even claimed that he has spoken to the Indians working there.Rules are the same in India and Pakistan. If anybody from the two countries has to travel to the other country, they have to report to police. I spoke about Indians working in Sharifs sugar mills in Rawalpindi and nobody dared to rebut it, which shows whatever I said was true. They are slaughtering national sovereignty and should be questioned, he said.Qadri demanded that the Sharifs and their ministers should be arrested and then interrogated.Meanwhile, responding to Qadris allegations, Sharif Group of Industries Managing Director Yousaf Abbas Sharif said that not a single Indian was working in the sugar mill.He pointed out that currently, 1,100 plus employees were employed at the mills, but none of them are foreigners.Tahirul Qadri is a proven liar.

Verma's father is a senior reporter of a vernacular daily. A case has been registered against Verma under the NDPS Act, 1985, at Dibrugarh police station. ""Verma has claimed to be a reporter of an English daily. A valid identity card of Itanagar-based newspaper The Dawnlit Post was recovered from his possession. He has confessed that he used to traffic drugs to Arunachal Pradesh regularly. From his statement we are trying to identify the network of drug dealers and traffickers,"" Dibrugarh superintendent of police Bir Bikram Gogoi said. The management of The Dawnlit Post, however, has dismissed the claim and filed an FIR against Verma ""for bringing disrepute to the daily by misusing its reputation for nefarious purposes"". The publication was established in 1998. In a written statement, Dakter Esse, editor of the newspaper, said: ""Verma is not, and was never, associated with The Dawnlit Post in any manner. This daily has never issued any identity card to Mr Rahul Verma..."" The Arunachal Press Club, too, reacted strongly to Verma's claims. ""We strongly object to his claim, he is not a member of the Arunachal Press Club or the Arunachal Pradesh Union of Working Journalists or the Arunachal Electronic Media Association,"" press club president Chopa Cheda said. ""The Assam-based news channels should have confirmed with the Arunachal Press Club or The Dawnlit Post to verify his claims. The emergency mobile number and the registration number of the identity card should also have been verified before projecting him as reporter from Itanagar,"" Cheda said. The press club also said it would also file a case against Verma. ""Drug abuse is common in Dibrugarh, many schools students are often seen using drugs in some isolated places of Dibrugarh town. It shows that the district administration has completely failed to curb the drug menace,'' said Nabajyoti Borkakoty, a social activist of Dibrugarh. Drugs can be easily found in the Kalibari, Panchali and Grambazar areas of Dibrugarh town. ""Many intoxicated people can be found roaming around in Joggers' Park, 30m from the Dibrugarh SP's office. Many school students purchase drugs from the peddlers in the area,'' a regular at the park said. Ulfa (I) yesterday issued a statement against the growing menace of drugs in Assam. In an emailed statement, the militant group urged people to provide information about drug users and peddlers, based on which the rebel group would take action against them."

On both counts the demands for environmental resources along with life support systems of air, water and fertility of the topsoil have exhibited explosive growth. Climate change affects the supply of these resources adversely, creating shortages that some analysts warn are reaching dangerous proportions. Whatever might be the long-term solution, one short-term response would be to preserve, conserve and minimize wastage. Two consecutive bad monsoons, topped by an unusually scorching summer, have brought into focus the problems with the nation's system of managing critical resources. According to news reports, the 91 major reservoirs in the country have only 22 per cent of capacity as against 65 per cent capacity last year during the same time. Water shortages have hit large parts of the country and these hit poor people the most. They expend a large proportion of their daily energy on fetching water. It is not just about dry spells and inadequate rains. Overdrawing groundwater for agriculture as well as modern townships and gated communities, without proper plans for recharging and rain-water harvesting and recycling, has led to a water crisis that grows worse every year. A large part of the water for agriculture runs off to the sea and carries much of the essential nutrients of the topsoil with it. This year for the first time a power plant in West Bengal had to close for 10 days owing to the shortage of water. West Bengal is not considered a water deficit state. The reports from Maharashtra, Telangana, Rajasthan, the National Capital Region, Punjab and Haryana, Odisha and Kerala are of serious concern. There are mounting conflicts among people regarding sharing water. Some basic questions are being raised about water-consuming crops like sugar cane, or water-consuming products like beer and colas. It is the same story all over - a lack of foresight and planning coupled with a firm belief that the free gifts of nature will always be replenished. The crisis will not go away even if monsoons are normal this year. The solution requires preventing waste and using scarce resources wisely. Just making water a marketable commodity will also not suffice. Managing a renewable resource has its other challenges, such as putting in plans for well-managed supply. This is now of the highest priority."

Paediatricians also warned against using ORS which is sold over the counter. The paediatricians were speaking at a meeting organised by the Guwahati city branch of Indian Academy of Paediatrics on the occasion of ORS Week, observed from July 23 to July 30, here today. The theme for this year is ""ORS - the only right solution for diarrhoea"". According to available data, 13 per cent of the deaths in children below the age of five years occur because of diarrhoea in the state. Diarrhoea is also the second leading cause of death in children of this age group in the country. The worst affected districts in the state are Nagaon, Barpeta, Darrang and the Barak Valley. ""Diarrhoea is a common infection and affects many children. However, it is necessary that parents give him or her WHO-recommended ORS that will prevent dehydration. Dehydration caused by diarrhoea is what causes complications in children, leading to death. In fact, the child should be given ORS as soon as the symptoms are manifest and then he should be taken to a doctor, who will start the necessary treatment,"" said Mridupawan Saikia, a paediatrician and secretary of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Guwahati city branch. ""Administering ORS is the first essential line of treatment that should be followed to effectively deal with diarrhoea or dysentery. But commercially available ORS or fruit juice should not be given as this will only aggravate the condition,"" he said. In case a sick child refuses to take ORS, he should be given a solution made of one glass of water, one teaspoon of sugar and a pinch of salt. If he refuses to take this solution too, then he should be fed plain water to ensure the fluid loss in his body is replenished, said a child specialist."

But I have seen people also make their own efforts. In several villages, an awareness has been seen with regard to the value of water and in such places, there is sensitivity and a will to do something to conserve,"" he said.He referred to the weather forecast which has predicted that the country will receive 106 per cent to 110 per cent rainfall during this Monsoon and said such good news always brings peace.""But this news brings new awareness also...While the news about good rainfall brings comfort, it also provides an opportunity and a challenge. Can we run a movement from village to village to preserve water?... To whatever extent possible, we must save water.""The rain water should be preserved. The water of a village should remain in the village. If we make a resolve to do this, it is possible through a mass campaign. So even though we have a water crisis now, we have one and a half month to prepare (before the onset of Monsoon),"" he said.While pitching for water conservation, the Prime Minister cited how in Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace Porbandar, tanks have been built beneath the houses which are even 200 years old.He also gave examples witnessed at various places, like changing of the crop pattern in view of scarce water and adoption of sprinklers, drip irrigation, water harvesting and water recharging methods.Modi said he has been told that in Devas district of Madhya Pradesh, the Panchayat has been making efforts to build farm ponds, 27 of which have been constructed, resulting in rise in groundwater level.Such methods also lead to improvement in the quality of water and pure water becomes a reason for GDP growth as well, he said.He hailed the railways for the quickness it displayed in ferrying water to the water-starved areas but said the villagers deserve more praise for adopting various innovative methods to fight drought.""The government's good work sometimes comes to the fore but if we look around, we will see what kind of new methods people use to address the crisis,"" Modi said.Turning to efforts to clean Ganga, he said this process has been underway for about 30 years during which several governments came, a number of programmes were undertaken and ""huge costs"" incurred.""This task (of cleaning Ganga) can never succeed without people's participation and that is we all have to become an agent of change in this,"" he said.""From government's side, several efforts are being made. Efforts are being made to take utmost cooperation of states located on the banks of Ganga. Efforts are also being made to connect social and voluntary organisations with this. Several steps have been taken for surface cleaning and stopping industrial pollution,"" he said.To clean the large quantity of filth draining into Ganga every day, 'trash skimmers' have been put into service at places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna, the Prime Minister said.The 'trash skimmers', which clean the filth while floating, have been provided to all local bodies and they have been urged to keep using these machines.""In coming days, trash skimmers are planned to be put into service at more places and its benefits will be felt immediately by the people living on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna,"" Modi said.To stop industrial pollution caused by pulp and paper, distillery and sugar industry, an action plan has been prepared, he said, adding it is being implemented to some extent and felt that it will also bear good results.He said officials have told him that there has been success in ensuring 'zero liquid discharge' from distillery in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and that discharge from pulp and paper industry or 'black liquor' has been almost stopped.The Prime Minister said there is public faith that Ganga will be cleaned which will definitely bring success.""For Ganga cleaning, people are even giving donations. This process is being done in a good way,"" he said.Modi also referred to the 'Gram Uday se Bharat Uday' campaign run by the government from April 14, the birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar, till today, the day celebrated as Panchayati Raj Day.In this context, he pitched for strengthening the democracy at grassroots level so that local bodies are empowered to tackle issues like infrastructure, school dropout and saving the girl child.During these 10 days, he said umpteen campaigns were run to create awareness at village level.After a caller said there should be focus on quality of education as standards of students are not good, Modi said the concern was natural.""So far, the mantra of 'enrolment, enrolment' has been ringing continuously. But now focus should be on providing good education, quality education to those children who reach the schools,"" the Prime Minister said.While contending that the government is laying thrust on providing good education, he acknowledged that ""it is a long journey ahead"" but said that if 125 crore people decide, this long journey will also be completed.He referred to the budget, saying it provides for giving freedom to universities to excel and compete at international level.""Skill is equally important as education. Similarly, technology also has a big role to placy. Long distance education, technology will make our education easy and in the near future, the results will show. I am confident,"" he said."

Despite frequent crackdowns by the excise department and the police, the sale of brown sugar is climbing in slums, official sources said. A senior excise official said while 1kg of ganja was procured for Rs 3,000, the peddlers sell it to individual customers at twice the price. But peddlers dealing in brown sugar charge Rs 20,000 for 10 grams. The margin of profit is three times the procurement price. ""Ganja is smuggled in bulk that makes the consignment difficult to conceal. However, in case of brown sugar, it is procured in lesser amounts and becomes difficult for officials to detect such consignments,"" inspector of excise intelligence and enforcement bureau (Cuttack) Amarendra Kumar Jena told The Telegraph. Another official said that in most cases, these peddlers mixed powdered milk, sugar, talcum powder and incense stick ashes with the contraband to fetch more profit. He said: ""In November last year, we had arrested two brown sugar peddlers from the Haldipadia slum in Laxmisagar who admitted that they adulterated the contraband to increase the volume. A peddler sells 0.1 gram of adulterated contraband for Rs 250."" Excise officials said brown sugar peddlers had devised innovative ways to keep the contraband away from eyes of the informers. ""In a recent case, we found that the peddler had stored brown sugar in plastic cups that are used to store ice cream. Besides, there were instances of storing it in worn out shoes,"" said the official. The police said the high margin of profit often lures peddlers to restart the business even after serving jail terms for the same offence. ""We have noticed that when a peddler gets arrested, his family members take over the business,"" said a police officer. Another excise official said that several peddlers together maintained a customer base, especially of students, and effectively used mobile phones to deliver the contraband. The selling of the contraband is being done so discreetly that it has become increasingly difficult for the police to get clues about the business. According to official records, the police have only seized only nine grams of brown sugar in Bhubaneswar in the past two years. Deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi said the police would start a drive to crack down on the peddlers selling brown sugar. ""Local residents should inform the police if they find out about the contraband being sold in their locality. We will also send our men in plain clothes to the suspected selling points to nab sellers,"" said Bhoi."

On Friday night Joe Clough came to know that Muhammad Ali was not well. But he didn't think the end would be so near. American Clough is currently the technical director of Indian Boxing Council. He had been the head coach of the Muhammad Ali's boxing club in 1979. And it was then that he saw the legend from very close quarters. Speaking to The Telegraph from Pune on Saturday evening, Clough said: ""It's difficult to accept that he is no more. But what can we do rather than accept this brutal truth?"" He added: ""I knew him for the past 46 years. I have many memories of him and I do not know where to begin. I first saw him in 1970 at a camp in California. He was then banned from boxing as he had refused to join the American Army."" Ali was a great motivator, Clough recalled. ""In the camp in Santa Monica, he used to interact with young boxers and motivate them. He was already a superstar."" Ali was very serious during training sessions. ""He used to train for one-and-a-half hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon. But throughout the day, he used to follow a tough routine. I never saw him indulge in late nights,"" said Clough. Clough was impressed with the way Ali used to focus during his training sessions. ""Nothing could distract him... He used to be tremendously focused."" The coach added: ""He used to practise his punches for hours. People may say all kinds of things about him, but as far as my experiences goes, he was not afraid of anything. He liked to face challenges,"" Clough added. Ali was very down to earth, he said. ""When I joined his club as a coaching staff, I had the chance to interact with him more... I found him to be very down to earth and kind."" But after practice, Ali was a different person altogether, said Clough. ""He used to watch the young boxers train. He also used to ask me about how they could improve... He would even train with them at times to encourage them."" Despite his bold image, Clough used to find Ali to be a little shy. ""He used to talk with us very freely. But as he was a superstar, he was almost always surrounded with fans. And in front of them, he would be discreet. He would hardly talk about himself or his career."" The American said: ""As we were almost of the same age, we used to spend some quality time together after training. Even if it was a very hard day, he would always be smiling. I will never forget that. ""We last we met in the late 1980s, but I used to follow his every move. I also have very good relation with his family. We had a great journey. Rest in peace my friend."" Clough had trained the likes of Evander Holyfield, Jonny Bumphus, Sugar Ray Seales and Rocky Lockridge."

Fit he is, but there's no way he can make it on his own.Wriddhiman's cottage is No. X, about the closest to the reception.

A sign, really, of excellent camaraderie.Such bonding is especially needed on tours like the West Indies where there's little to do in the evenings. Particularly if one is booked into a resort.The Sugar Ridge is almost cut off from the rest of Antigua.Because of its location, captain Virat first went to Wriddhiman's cottage, after India's quick win in the opening Test, and quickly headed for the PlayStation.Keeping Virat and Wriddhiman company were Cheteshwar Pujara and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Shikhar Dhawan wasn't there, but he's known to frequent the 'keeper's cottage.It's not uncommon to hear shouts of ""Oh,"" "" Arre yaar,"" ""Uff,"" ""Kya baat hai..."" emanating from the resort's most popular cottage.So it was on Sunday evening too.""Adda na, teammates ra ashe jaye...

The series has just begun,"" Wriddhiman said in a brief, informal chat.The Virats, by the way, were at the PlayStation for much of the morning as well.Later, some of the India players headed to the Jolly Beach, which is fairly close to where they are staying.In that bunch was Lokesh Rahul, who'd bought himself a panama hat for USD 42 from the resort's gift shop.Shikhar too was looking to pick up one.Postscript: The cottage numbers have not been identified for reasons of security."

The honours have gone to two men: Virat Kohli, India's Test captain, and the fiercely competitive Ravichandran Ashwin. Virat and Ashwin collaborated no less than 168 for the fifth wicket, throwing the West Indies on the mat so very early in the four-Test series. While Virat's an absolute master now, highly accomplished, too, is Ashwin. Just months after telling The Telegraph that Virat would go on to become an ""all-time legend,"" Ashwin had the best seat as the former stroked his way to a maiden 200. Ashwin, promoted to No.6 ahead of Wriddhiman Saha, himself played a handsome hand of 113 as India took a stranglehold on the opening Test. In fact, all three of Ashwin's Test hundreds have come against the West Indies, beginning with the 103 in his debut series (Mumbai, November 2011). After being in the thick of action for almost all of Friday, Ashwin faced the media at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Excerpts... On enjoying batting against the West Indies... That's because I've got more time against the West Indies and, each time that I got a hundred, I had a specialist batsman at the other end. For a batsman lower down the order, that's important... I have got runs against the West Indies and if you start getting a liking towards one team, then something within tells you that you can do it again. Simply enjoying batting... I've always wanted to be in the top seven for India. It's a goal I have to strive for and get better at. I need to thank Anil bhai (head coach Kumble) and Virat for having had the confidence in me to be pushed at No.6... Virat had called in the morning to say I'd be batting at No.6, ahead of Saha, which was a big boost... I'd been working on my batting in Chennai over the past one month and I'm happy with the results... I'd never left so many balls... Before the Test, Ajinkya Rahane told me about batting for 200 balls. My aim was for 150 and to try and see where I got... In between, I'd played one over from (Shannon) Gabriel which was loose. Virat came over and said that is what I needed to avoid to be successful in Test cricket. [As it turned out, Ashwin batted for 253 balls.] Change in stance... First things first, Sanjay Bangar, our batting coach, has worked very closely on my stance for the past 12 months. It has been a challenge... I used to be extra side-on and had to open myself a little bit. The change has been very effective. Other things like my initial movement also had to be sorted. It was a process for 10-12 months and, on the way, I did lose a few innings as a batsman. Role he's looking at and if the 113 has helped him make a statement... I'm not trying to state anything that is not obvious. I'm just trying to enjoy my batting. If this is what the team expects out of me, then that is what I'm going to try and give. Some sort of solidity walking in at No.6. It's not that you walk in at No.6 and start getting the runs. It's not as simple as it sounds, but I'd really make an effort to be as solid as I can be. The team should feel that somebody who gives solidity has walked in. More than anything it's a goal I'm striving for. Batting with Virat... The West Indies bowling coach (Roddy Estwick) has talked about how good the wicket is, but certain shots cannot be played on it. The wicket has good bounce and there are areas where the ball is coming at a different pace... Yet, when I walked in, I felt Virat was hitting a few shots which I'd find impossible to connect. That's the sheer brilliance of Virat and he's been batting like that for the past year or so. He's playing shots which make the bowling look ridiculous. Out of the ordinary shots. On looking ahead... We'll have to maintain the intensity for every hour. We'll have to earn every wicket. Postscript: Back at the Sugar Ridge Resort, Ashwin was warmly hugged by chief selector Sandeep Patil. ""Very good innings, well done, Ash,"" he said."

The NPP also asked state food and civil supplies minister Clement Marak to step down. Speaking to reporters here, NPP legislator and party spokesperson James K. Sangma said after the Centre stopped the system of levying sugar in 2014, all state governments were asked to procure PDS sugar from open markets, and the supplier selected through floating of tender. Under the new system, the Centre provided a subsidy of Rs 18.50 per kg to the state government for purchasing PDS sugar from the open market. Alleging anomalies in the process, James said when the first tender was floated, four bidders participated, including Sanna Enterprises (quoting Rs 37,850 per metric tonne), Tatyasahebkore Warna SSK Ltd (Rs 40,701 per metric tonne) and Kendriya Bhandar (Rs 43,270 per metric tonne). According to James, after the tenders were opened, the state government delayed finalising the supplier, which compelled Sanna Enterprises (lowest bidder) and Tatyasahebkore Warna SSK Ltd to withdraw their offers, and the government selected the highest bidder, Kendriya Bhandar, a firm based in Guwahati, which tied up with Sainik Foods, New Delhi, to supply the PDS sugar. When the second tender was floated in September 2015, Garden Court Distilleries Private Limited quoted Rs 44,351 per metric tonne, Beta Edible Processing Private Limited quoted Rs 44,440, S.S. Food Industries quoted Rs 44,570 and Dr Frozen Foods Indian Private Limited quoted Rs 45,610. ""Instead of selecting the first and lowest bidder, Garden Court Distilleries Private Limited, the state government, in collusion with the other bidders, cancelled the tendering process on the ground that the rates received for supply of sugar were higher, after which, a three-month extension was given to Kendriya Bhandar to supply sugar at Rs 43,270 per metric tonne,"" James said. The NPP MLA alleged that after November 2015, the state government changed the eligibility criteria ""designed in such a way which makes its preferred choices the only parties eligible during technical evaluation."" The NPP leader said the additional condition was incorporated when the third tender was called in March this year, in which three firms - Beta Edible Processing Private Limited (Rs 54,270 per metric tonne), S.S. Food Industries (Rs 55,050 per metric tonne) and Dr Frozen Foods Indian Private Limited (Rs 56,210 per metric tonne) - were found eligible, while one bidder, Garden Courts Distilleries Private Limited, was disqualified. Subsequently, James said, Beta Edibles Processing Private Limited was selected, though the rate for supply of sugar was high, where the state government had to shell out more at Rs 16.77/kg. James said the action of the state government clearly suggested that it was bent on allotting the work to their ""preferred party"" at the cost of the state exchequer. He also said the consumers did not receive PDS sugar regularly. Tura MP and NPP national president Conrad K. Sangma also termed the issue serious and said he would take it up with the Centre. A state government official told The Telegraph today that price of 1kg PDS sugar in Meghalaya was Rs 44.27, including Rs 18.50 central subsidy and Rs 5.77 state subsidy. The consumers have to pay Rs 20 and the sugar is distributed at 3kg per ration card, he said. as it reportedly did not fulfil the conditions mentioned in the tender. In a statement issued today, Meghalaya principal secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs) P.W. Ingty said sugar was being provided to PDS beneficiaries through fair price shops at the rate of Rs 20 per kg. ""A transparent system of procuring sugar from the open market through e-tendering is being followed in the state, where the tender is allotted to the lowest successful bidder who has fulfilled all requirements in the tender document,"" Ingty said in the statement."
58fedd467be9e0420db28ae0,"Camps keep cattle alive with water, fodder & free lunches for owners",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160621/jsp/nation/story_92430.jsp,2016-06-21,"You can tell from a distance that it's neither a village nor a fairground. Tens of thousands of cows, bulls and buffalo are grunting and mooing inside rows and rows of bamboo-and-tin sheds. Hundreds of people are bustling about, and fodder-laden bullock carts keep coming and going. The stench of methane pervades the air as you pick your way through a minefield of dung. Welcome - if that's the right word - to one of Maharashtra's biggest ""cattle camps"", which has all the commotion and expanse of a fairground but little of its joy or colour. But what this 100-acre tract of land, about a kilometre from Palvan village in drought-stricken Marathwada, has in abundance is grit. It's reflected in the words of Vishnu Baglane, 28, one of the hundreds who have moved in with their cattle from villages far and near, drawn by the free sheds, water and fodder for their animals and free lunches for themselves. All provided by the NGO organiser, with state government help, at a time successive droughts have left the earth parched and the fields barren. ""I tell myself several times a day not to give up,"" Vishnu says, splashing a mug of water on one of his 20 animals in temperatures approaching 45 degrees. ""It's just a matter of hanging on for a few more months."" Vishnu is hoping this monsoon will be good. He and his father Raghunath, 64, have been here since September, after the fourth straight failed monsoon in Marathwada. The son tends to the cattle from 7am to 7 pm; the father arrives after dinner to sleep in the cowshed through the night. The women of the family often come visiting from their home in Kakadhire, 5km away, bringing the children who prance about the place. Sometimes, close relatives drop by too. Long history Cattle camps or chara chhaonis have had a long history in Maharashtra and Karnataka as a short-term drought measure, apparently starting from Shivaji's reign in the 17th century. Since 2011, they have become a part of the summer landscape in Maharashtra, particularly in its dry central and western belts. But last year was the first time that some of them stretched till winter and on to the new year, and are still continuing through this summer. Social organisations or sugar factories lease farmland denuded by drought and set up these camps, running them with help from the state government or goodwill-seeking political parties. Some 350 cattle camps sheltering nearly 250,000 animals are now operating in Marathwada's three worst-hit districts: Latur, Osmanabad and Beed. Of these, Beed accounts for 265 camps, small and big, Osmanabad has 80-odd and Latur just one. The one at Palvan, 15km from Beed town, harbours about 5,000 small and big animals, belonging to 300-odd farmers from 32 villages. It's run by a multipurpose society, the Yashwant Bahuuddeshiy Sevabhavi Sanstha of Rajendra Mhaske, aide to local politician Vinayak Mete who two years ago switched loyalties from the Nationalist Congress Party to the BJP. With a staff of 65, the camp is managed well. Each inmate, like Vishnu, has been issued with an identity card, a daily coupon and a fodder quota based on the number of animals in his shed. Each farmer is given a serial number when the camp office starts distributing fodder, so that there's no crowding or chaos. Some of the cattle owners keep shuttling between their villages and the camp, the rest have moved in lock, stock and barrel, sleeping in the cowsheds or tents. Savita Sachin Munde, for instance, came from Chikhalbed, 60km away, along with her husband, two children and four cows six months ago. She tends to the cattle while her husband works as a camp labourer. ""We'll be here until the monsoon arrives,"" she said last month. (The monsoon has now arrived in Marathwada.) Like a village, the camp has developed its own community life. It recently hosted a mass wedding where 50-odd couples from among the inmates' families tied the knot. Challenges The government gives Rs 63 per big animal and Rs 30 per small animal per day but camp supervisor Satish Shelke says this is peanuts. ""We have to spend a lot from our own kitty,"" he says, ""but if you stand by people in bad times, they will stand by you."" Shelke's biggest challenge this summer has been finding water and fodder (sugarcane and green foliage). ""We need 3 lakh litres of water every day. A 12,000-litre water tanker costs Rs 1,500,"" he says. So, the camp spends Rs 37,500 on 25 water tankers every day. Add to that the cost of fodder, the free lunches for up to 400 people and other expenses, and the monthly bill runs into several crores, he claims. ""We raise most of it from our own businesses and donations."" The Palvan camp brings the fodder from sugarcane-rich Satara, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar, and the green feed from other states. ""This year has been bad, there's no fodder anywhere,"" says the supplier, Shrimant Bapu Gursale, 67. ""The sugar factories aren't allowing farmers to cut their cane and sell it to us, fearing a cane shortage that could hurt their production next year."" He adds: ""The farther you go in search of fodder, the more you have to spend. The transport cost rises, so does the wastage."" In 2012-13, Maharashtra had about a million animals lodged in cattle camps across the state's west and Marathwada. The state BJP government is under fire from the Opposition and ally Shiv Sena because this year, the camps are confined to just three districts. But the government has been reluctant to support too many fodder camps because of allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the past. In many places, therefore, farmers are being forced into distress sale of cattle. One of them is Baba Jadhav, who rears and sells the expensive Devni breed of cows at Ambewadi village in Latur district, about 250km from Palvan. The 45-year-old has won many awards for his cattle breeds but, unable to feed his cows this year, he has had to give away nearly a dozen of them to his friends in Pune. ""I sell a dozen cows and buffalo every year, each animal fetching me handsome money. But this year's drought will hurt me for at least two more years (the time taken to rear a calf),"" Jadhav says. At least half the animals in his village have been sold at throwaway prices in the past three months, some to farmers from other states. Vishnu says he is indebted to the Palvan camp organisers for saving his 10 cows, 2 bullocks and 8 buffalo after the failure of his summer and winter crops The young farmer has already seen many droughts and knows this will not be the last. But at the moment, his goal is to keep his animals alive. ""An animal saved today,"" he says, ""is an animal earned tomorrow."""
58fedd607be9e0420db28b06,Levy logic to curb wheat import,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160618/jsp/business/story_91897.jsp,2016-06-18,"New Delhi, June 17: The government has extended a 25 per cent import duty on wheat to check cheap inbound shipments at a time domestic output is likely to grow 9 per cent in spite of drought conditions in some parts of the country. According to the agriculture ministry's third advance estimate, wheat output has risen to 94.05 million tonnes (mt) in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) from 86.53mt in the previous year. The government has maintained the import duty at 25 per cent in view of higher production estimates. However, traders expect around 10 per cent drop in production because of the severe drought. The government wants to watch the situation and reduce the duty later. At present, the focus is on controlling food inflation. In spite of plentiful wheat stock at home, some flour millers near the port cities in south India have been importing it because it is cheaper to buy from countries such as Australia than transporting the grain from northern and central states. Sugar levy Last night, the government slapped a 20 per cent customs duty on sugar exports to boost domestic supply and check prices, which are ruling high at Rs 40 per kg. ""We do not want any speculative rise in the prices of sugar. In order to make sure that there is enough sugar available for the Indian market, this step has been taken,"" commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters today. ""It seems that the Centre wants to conserve sugar domestically in view of an expected fall in output in the next 2016-17 sugar season (October-September),"" Indian Sugar Mills Association director-general Abinash Verma said. ""With the recent spurt in global prices, sugar exports were just about becoming viable but the 20 per cent export duty, which translates into about $100 per tonne, will make exports unviable,"" he said. Manufacturing push In a move to push domestic manufacturing, the government today asked Hyundai Motor India to set up its third plant in the country. ""I do not think there are enough reasons for you (Hyundai) to think more about it. It's time that you set it up and this is a good time for Hyundai to announce this,"" Sitharaman said She said the government was actively taking steps to improve the country's business environment. The South Korean auto major has two plants at Sriperumbudur near Chennai. ""The decision is apparently with the Hyundai leadership and I would only suggest that since they have two successful plants here, setting up of a third should not be an issue,"" she said."

File picture Shillong, July 21: The estimate committee of the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly is now taking on the Mukul Sangma-led government for its omissions and commissions on issues of public importance, including health and distribution of rice and sugar under the public distribution system. The committee, with former chief minister and Congress leader D.D. Lapang as its chairman, met yesterday along with a host of MLAs who are members of the committee and summoned officers from departments of health and family welfare, hospital management, planning, urban affairs and food and civil supplies. A statement issued here today said the committee had raised many important points on several projects and pointed out delays in completion and non-functional due to omissions, commissions and lack of commitment of officers. Besides Lapang, other MLAs who are members of the committee and attended the meeting were R.V. Lyngdoh, Jemino Mawthoh, Nihim D. Shira, Witting Mawsor, senior officers of the rank of additional chief secretary, secretaries, directors and other officers. The estimate committee dwelt on issues related to healthcare services such as construction of a 50-bed maternal and child health hospital at Khliehriat in East Jaintia Hills district, upgrade of equipment# and infrastructure of OTs and an infertility centre at Ganesh Das Hospital, Shillong. Moreover, a delay in construction of a medical college at the site of RP Chest Hospital, Shillong, due to not allotment of land at Umsawli by the urban affairs department was raised in the meeting. The committee also criticised the government for defunct MRI and X-Ray machine at the civil hospital. An MRI machine which cost over Rs 5 crore has been lying idle, the statement said, while expressing concern over the failure of the health department to take effective steps in this regard. The estimate committee asked the department to complete repair of the MRI machine and make it functional within two months. It also directed the department to complete all necessary works and formalities for the trauma centres at Nongpoh, Tura and Jowai. The estimate committee also summoned officials of the state food and civil supplies department and criticised the department for allotting the quota of rice to suppliers without finalising names, locations and number of consumers. The committee also questioned the department over the rate of sugar fixed by the department at Rs 54 per kg whereas the rate in open market is Rs 44 per kg. ""The department tried to explain that the government has subsidised the rate for the consumers that it has become less than Rs 44,"" the statement said. The estimate committee has also decided to visit headquarters of all districts in the state. The next tour of its members will be to the Garo hills."

The brand new complex of residential towers are where nearly 11,000 athletes and some 6,000 coaches and other handlers will stay during the upcoming games(AP Photo/Leo Correa)Ready or not, the Rio Olympics are opening their doors.The Games begin in just over two weeks, but the Athletes Village opens officially on Sunday, meaning 10,500 athletes and another 7,000 staff members will start trickling into the luxurious layout, with the pace picking up daily until the Aug 5 opening ceremony at the Maracana Stadium.The 31-building compound should pamper the worlds best. Its set among tennis courts, soccer fields, seven swimming pools with mountains and the sea as a backdrop and topped off by a massive dining-kitchen compound thats as large as three football fields.I want to help all the athletes have a wonderful welcome to Brazil, said Priscilla Antonello, a residence center deputy manager whose job is to help athletes find their accommodations.Will she be star-struck by so many Olympians?I couldnt be in this job if I behaved like that, she replied Saturday, standing on the 13th floor of one of buildings, gazing out over cycling paths, bubbling fountains and lots of green.She already knows which countries will be where, but shes not allowed to say.Some delegations had already arrived on Saturday, easy to spot with banners or flags hanging off the sides of buildings.Slovenia had the best banner. In green and white it says: I Feel sLOVEenia. The LOVE portion was set off in white type, making sure the message got across.Another read: All for Denmark.Banners or flags from Canada, Britain, Portugal, Finland and Sweden were among those spotted. A tiny red and yellow Chinese flag was pinned near the top of one of the compounds.Everything about the village is massive, though fairly standard for recent Summer Olympics.Organizers say the compound has:10,160 rooms; 18,000 beds; seven laundries; an enormous, hospital-like clinic; a massive gym.In addition, organizers are providing 450,000 condoms, three times more than London did four years ago. Among them will be 100,000 female condoms.Watch Video: Whats making newsOrganizers said this is to encourage safe sex. Many had considered that increased supply to be due to Brazils outbreak of the Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects.Asked about it on Saturday, deputy chief medical officer Marcelo Patricio replied: No, its not.Then theres the dining-kitchen area, a sprawling tent where officials expect to serve about 60,000 meals daily to Olympians and staff and perhaps another 10,000 daily to the hired help.The hardest part is knowing how much to prepare, said Flavia Albuquerque, who oversees Rios food and beverage service. We want them to eat anything they want to.That will be easy. The choices are nearly infinite. Diners will choose from different buffets Brazilian, Asian, International, and Pasta and Pizza. Then theres a casual dining area that will feature barbeque.The casual area might be the most popular, Albuquerque said.There will be lots of dirty plates, but none to wash. The plates will be biodegradable, made of corn and sugar cane.Brazilians figure their food will be a hit: rice, black beans, farofa (flour from toasted cassava often sprinkled on top of food) and meat. And Brazils exotic juice will be popular: caju, acai, carambola, caqui, goiaba and maracuja, often squeezed into juices sucos in Portuguese.Billionaire real estate developer Carlos Carvalho might have the only problem.He aims to sell the 3,604 apartments after the Olympics some in the range of 2.3 million ($700,000). Carvalhos company Carvalho Hosken has declined to say how many have been sold, but reports say only between 6-10 percent.The project is a victim of Brazils deep recession, the worst since the 1930s.Carvalho Hosken earlier said the projects total cost was about $1.5 billion, including construction, land acquisition and other development costs.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Singh's family has its roots in Buxar, 135km from Patna.From Buxar, Singh was directly taken to Mau where he had made the remark against the Bahujan Samaj Party president last week. The court of the chief judicial magistrate sent him to 14 days of judicial remand after a two-hour hearing.Lucknow police had registered a case against Singh on the complaint of Mewalal Gautam, national secretary of the BSP. A non-bailable warrant was issued against him yesterday and the case was transferred to Mau.The expelled leader was on his way from Deoghar in Jharkhand to Uttar Pradesh when the STF intercepted his Internet connection through his mobile phone and found that he was in Buxar.His brother Dharmendra Singh was present in court during the hearing.There was tension at the court gates as a large number of lawyers assembled there in Singh's support.Reacting to the arrest, Mayawati said the Samajwadi Party government was left with little option after Allahabad High Court rejected Singh's plea for a stay on his arrest.""Hand in glove with the BJP, the SP government was not willing to arrest Singh.

58feea9a7be9e0420db29587,Meghalaya out of PDS sugar,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160616/jsp/northeast/story_91451.jsp,2016-06-16,"Shillong, June 15: Beneficiaries of the public distribution system (PDS) in Meghalaya have not received sugar since January this year and the state government is uncertain whether it can compensate for the months when sugar was not distributed. After the Centre stopped the system of levying sugar in 2014, Meghalaya and other states in the country were asked to procure PDS sugar from open markets and were instructed to select the supplier by floating a tender. Earlier the Meghalaya government had appointed Kendriya Bhandar, which had quoted Rs 43,270 per metric tonne, to supply PDS #sugar to the state. Meghalaya's requirement for PDS sugar is 1,704 metric tonnes per month. When Kendriya Bhandar was the supplier, the price of 1kg PDS sugar in Meghalaya was Rs 44.27. The total price includes Rs 18.50 central subsidy, Rs 5.77 state subsidy and a consumers' share of Rs 20. The sugar was distributed at 3kg per ration card. ""The PDS sugar being distributed this month (June) to the beneficiaries was for the month of December last year. The state has not received PDS sugar since January this year as the state government is in the process of selecting a fresh supplier,"" Meghalaya principal secretary (food and civil supplies) P.W. Ingty told The Telegraph here today. Ingty said Kendriya Bhandar had supplied PDS sugar to the state only till December last year. Asked if the government would compensate for the months when sugar was not distributed (since January this year), Ingty said the state government would approach the Centre to assist with some subsidy to the state so that sugar may be distributed to the beneficiaries for such months. Ingty said fresh tender was invited in March this year to get a new supplier. Of the six firms that participated, the tendering committee found three eligible firms - Beta Edible Processing Private Limited (quoted Rs 54,270 per metric tonne), S.S. Food Industries (Rs 55,050 per metric tonne) and Dr Frozen Foods Indian Private Limited (Rs 56,210 per metric tonne). According to Ingty, while the government was in the process of selecting the supplier, one of the disqualified firms - Garden Courts Distilleries Private Limited - went to the court on this issue and Meghalaya High Court had recently passed a stay order prohibiting the government from going ahead with the allotment of work. Yesterday, Meghalaya High Court has directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder affidavit within a week and listed the matter for hearing after one week. However on June 13, the Opposition, National People's Party (NPP), has demanded a CBI probe into the alleged anomalies in the tendering process. The party also alleged ""favouritism"" by the Congress-led government while selecting the supplier for PDS sugar in the state and asked the state food and civil supplies minister Clement Marak to step down. NPP legislator and party spokesman James K. Sangma said Beta Edibles Processing Private Limited was selected though the rate quoted for supply of sugar was high, where the state government had to shell out more at Rs 16.77 per kg. Questioning the move, James pointed out that when the state government's tender was floated in September 2015, the bidders, Garden Court Distilleries Private Limited, had quoted Rs 44,351 per metric tonne, Beta Edible Processing Private Limited quoted Rs 44,440, S.S. Food Industries quoted Rs 44,570 and Dr Frozen Foods Indian Private Limited quoted Rs 45,610. ""Instead of selecting the first and the lowest bidder - Garden Court Distilleries Private Limited - the state government cancelled the tendering process on the ground that the rates received for the supply of sugar were higher, after which, a three-month extension was given to Kendriya Bhandar to supply sugar at Rs 43,270 per metric tonne,""? James said. James said the action of the state government clearly suggested that it was bent on allotting the work to ""preferred party"" at the cost of the state exchequer and made the people suffer. Asked if Beta Edible Processing Private Limited has been chosen to supply PDS sugar, Ingty said, ""Though, from among the three firms, Beta Edibles Processing Private Limited has quoted the lowest rate, the government has not decided to allot the work to this firm,"" he said. Ingty said any firm selected by the government to be the supplier should bear all costs, which include cost for transporting sugar to go-downs in the districts of the state, handling and cost of packaging of 1kg sugar in polybags along with state PDS logo. The official said since the matter is in court, the government would wait for a final order from the court in this regard."

Baliarsingh joined the BDA in 1995 and was continuing in the same post. ""We are investigating how he managed to amass so much wealth,"" the official said. Cash loot Armed criminals today allegedly looted Rs 45 lakh cash from employees of Godiapada toll plaza near Jankia in Khurda district, 50km from here. The incident took place around 3.10pm when four employees of the collecting agency were on their way to deposit the cash in a bank. On January 4, armed robbers had allegedly looted Rs 28.5 lakh from the accountant of a tollgate near Jankia. ""The plaza employees told us that they were travelling in a car with the cash when another car chased and intercepted their vehicle. They also told us that three gun-wielding persons threatened them and decamped with the cash,"" said a police officer. The police said the cash was collected over two days at the plaza. Khurda police superintendent Dilip Das said the toll collection firm had ignored advice to employ security guards while transporting cash. ""We started an investigation after a complaint was lodged. We are trying to ascertain whether insiders were involved,"" said Das. Drug peddlers held Police today arrested three persons and seized 800 packets of brown sugar weighing around 150 grams. The trio had been running the racket in the twin cities. The cops said the market value of the contraband was Rs 7 lakh. The accused have been identified as Pramod Jena, Manas Jena and Purna Khatei. Addressing a news conference in Cuttack, Police commissioner Y.B. Khurania said the accused were all part of a brown sugar racket that had been operating in the twin cities for a couple of years."
58feebad7be9e0420db29752,Price pinch gets harder,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160614/jsp/business/story_91072.jsp,2016-06-14,"New Delhi, June 13: Consumer price inflation accelerated to a near two-year high in May, driven by food products such as pulses and sugar, which could rule out a rate cut in the next monetary policy review in August. Retail inflation, which the RBI tracks for its interest rate policy, rose to 5.76 per cent in May compared with an upwardly revised 5.47 per cent in April and 5.01 per cent in May 2015. Food inflation picked up to 7.55 percent in May from an upwardly revised 6.40 per cent in the previous month, as the prices of vegetables, sugar and pulses rose between 11 per cent and as much as 32 per cent from a year ago. Retail inflation has more than halved since November 2013, thanks to a crash in global commodity prices as well as subdued rural demand. It had hit 7.03 per cent in August 2014. Analysts fear an increase in the cost of petrol and diesel by more than 5 per cent since May 1, and food items such as sugar and milk in the last month, could further harden prices. Aditi Nayar, senior economist with Icra, said: ""The higher-than-expected uptick in CPI inflation in May 2016 has entirely been led by food items, with core inflation softening to 4.7 per cent as we had anticipated. From August 2016 onwards, we expect food inflation to soften on account of a number of factors, including a favourable base effect."" ""Moreover, incoming data on the distribution of rainfall and pace of sowing may dampen food inflation, particularly if higher MSPs are successful in boosting the acreage of high-inflation items such as pulses. Lower temperatures may douse the prices of perishables as well as non-vegetarian protein items,"" she said. Shortage in the sugar market could raise prices, and analysts expect rates to move up during the festival season. Items that affect the lives of middle- and lower-income Indians were dearer in May - cost of clothing and footwear went up 5.37 per cent year-on-year, fuel and light rose 2.94 per cent and housing prices increased 5.35 per cent. Two years of drought in succession have jacked up food prices, which is now evident from a higher retail inflation. With the monsoon expected to be normal this year, food prices may come down. Rate cut After leaving rates unchanged last week, governor Raghuram Rajan said the RBI, which has targeted inflation at 5 per cent by March 2017, was looking for room to reduce interest rates, but there were concerns over upward pressure on food and commodity prices. Finance ministry officials described the rise in food prices as ""seasonal"", blaming the long summer for the rise. However, they admitted that ""the problem with food prices is that they raise inflationary expectations... which in turn means that a cut in key rates are unlikely in the near future"". Richa Gupta, senior economist, Deloitte, said: ""Monetary easing in the near term looks difficult especially with a possible rate hike by the US Fed and the effects on monsoons still unclear. Expect easing to commence only when the RBI is sure of hitting the 5 per cent target in March next year."" Efficient management of the food basket is likely to become crucial for any monetary easing in the future. that despite a jump in food prices, core inflation moved down, imparting a downward bias to the overall print. However, Gupta added that this decline could possibly be short lived ""as the 7th pay commission is implemented and the base effect in certain categories wears off. Going forward we are likely to see inflation remain at around current level and move down slightly towards the end of the year."" Gupta said The latest data shows that if price increases don't come under control, the central bank will have to keep rates on hold despite its wish to cut interest rates further. ""Based on our expectation of some softening of food inflation from August 2016 onward, we continue to believe that it is too early to rule out further monetary easing in 2016, despite the second consecutive upside surprise in CPI inflation,"" Nayar added. RBI closely watches the CPI figures to set the interest rate policy. In its June monetary policy review, the central bank said the possibility of another rate cut later this year would arise if monsoon rains dampen upward pressure on food prices."

Telegraph picture Guwahati, May 8: Sleuths of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) today began operations at Gaya in Bihar and Rae Bareily in Uttar Pradesh on the basis of information provided by four drug dealers arrested here yesterday with over 54kg of opium and 2kg of morphine. Acting on specific information about a drug deal by an inter-state racket, the NCB team here raided a SUV (WB 58C2157) and arrested four persons - two from Manipur and one each from Gaya and Rai Bareily. The four have been identified as Abdul Kalam, Mujibur Rahman (Imphal East), Sohrab Khan (Gaya) and Ram Milan (Rai Bareily). ""Preliminary investigation revealed that the drugs were being taken from Manipur to the north Indian states via Guwahati. Kalam is the supplier while Khan is the buyer. This group seems to be conducting a big racket, with inter-state connections. Accordingly, we sought the help of our counterparts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and they have already swung into action,"" the zonal director of the NCB, Praveen Kumar Deshwal, said here today. The NCB sources said drugs such as heroin and brown sugar are prepared from the opium supplied from Manipur and supplied to various states. Those drugs are also used in parties in metros. ""The drugs were brought in trucks from Manipur. They had made secret chambers in the body of the SUV and concealed the consignment. The two buyers had come by air and were supposed to take the drugs by road from here,"" another source said. The seizure comes amid raids conducted by Assam police against drug peddlers in Guwahati, and Dibrugarh and Nagaon districts. The police seized drugs, ranging from heroine, ganja and psychotropic drugs (syrupablets) during the raid. Chief minister Tarun Gogoi yesterday expressed concern about the drug menace in the state. Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh are the two major sources of drugs and the inter-state drug smugglers supply them to various parts of the country. The enforcement agencies have been struggling to control the menace as opium and ganja is cultivated in interior places in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and in some parts of Assam (riverine areas), making it difficult for them to crack down on those involved. ""Ganja produced in Manipur, Tripura and Bhutan (supplied via Assam) has huge demand in states outside the Northeast. Being the gateway of the Northeast, Guwahati has been a transit route for the drug smugglers. Many carriers were arrested earlier in Guwahati but this time we managed to arrest the buyer and supplier,"" Deshwal said. Sources said the NCB decided to carry out operations in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to trace the buyers and those involved in the racket. ""We hope to stumble upon information to confirm whether the drug suppliers are financially supporting the opium cultivators in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh or not. We require some other information to crack down on the drug menace,"" another source in the bureau said."

International sugar futures reached a near four-year high in late June.India's production in the 2016-17 crop year should fall to around 23.3 million tonnes (mt), down from 25.1mt a year ago because of the drought, said Tarun Sawhney, president of Indian Sugar Mills Association, in Bangkok on Friday.With consumption at 26mt, India would draw down about 2.7mt from stocks to leave them at 4.3mt at the end of the 2016-17 crop year, he said.That was around two months of consumption, the lowest since 2005, and a level lower than India had traditionally kept of at least three months to deal with any supply shocks.Sugar prices in India have surged over 50 per cent since October and contributed to inflation, but Sawhney said there was no reason for a change in the government's policy to encourage imports.""The government's concern, and rightly so, is that prices don't rise dramatically at any given time,"" he said. ""But we have enough sugar, so there is no reason why prices should increase in a hurry."""
58fef5f87be9e0420db2a281,'Spiritual' network for Modi's SA trip,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160607/jsp/nation/story_89771.jsp,2016-06-07,"New Delhi, June 6: South Africa's Ramakrishna Centre is set to play a lead role in helping Narendra Modi connect with the Indian community when the Prime Minister touches down for a scheduled visit to the country next month. The BJP's overseas cell that usually organises Modi's engagements with the diaspora on overseas trips is working with the centre and two other spiritual missions in South Africa in the absence of its own unit and a community of RSS-BJP sympathisers there. The Divine Life Society, inspired by Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, and the Chinmaya Mission are the BJP's other conduits to reach out to people of Indian descent and NRIs in South Africa. The Ramakrishna Centre, a branch of the Belur Math Mission, traces its origins to 1934, when a monk, Swami Adyananda, stayed in South Africa for a few months at the invitation of the local community. However, the centre was established and strengthened in 1942 by a local resident, Dhanagopal Naidoo, who was inspired by Swami Vivekananda and later became Swami Nischalananda. The centre is now headed by Swami Sumanasananda, who was earlier based in Meghalaya. The other outfit the BJP's overseas cell counted on for support was the South African Hindu Mahasabha. Unlike the Ramakrishna Centre, the Divine Life Society and the Chinmaya Mission that focused their educational and welfare programmes to integrate the local African communities, the Mahasabha's charter was clear. Among its principal objectives, it said, were promotion of ingredients and foods specifically eaten by Hindus during religious rituals and encouraging education that fostered the ""advancement of Hindu dharma"" in South Africa. ""In that sense, the outfit is similar to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad,"" an RSS source said. However, BJP sources admitted that their outreach to the present generation of Indian migrants through the Ramakrishna Centre and the others, including the Hindu Mahasabha, might be ""limited"" by history and politics. Those of Indian descent account for 2.5 per cent of South Africa's 51.77 million population. Their ancestors were brought in to work as indentured labourers in the sugar plantations of what was Natal in the 19th century. They were followed by those who arrived as ""free Indians"" and included traders and professionals like Mahatma Gandhi who landed as a young barrister from Gujarat's Porbandar in May 1893. Many of those who came as Hindus converted to Christianity and adopted English as their first language. Then, those of Indian descent were not keen to be marked out as a distinct ethnic group, having worked hard to integrate with the ""African mainstream"" as a ""survival strategy"". ""They have had to face persecution and discrimination at the hands of the Africans and do not want to emphasise their identities,"" a BJP source said. That left the BJP to reach out to the relatively recent migrants and the ""considerably large"" grouping of IT professionals who live mostly in Johannesburg. Which is why Modi is still undecided on whether his South African sojourn should be about ""nostalgia"" or ""hard commerce"" and whether the diaspora outreach should be located in Durban or Johannesburg, the commercial capital. Durban has historical resonances for India because it was the first port-of-call for the indentured workers as well as the ""free Indians"". Gandhi's family had set up a farm at the Phoenix Settlement, 20km north of the city. The Pietermaritzburg railway station, where Gandhi was thrown off a first class coach out of bounds for non-whites, is 67km from Durban."

Official sources today said the government would allot the supply order to Beta Edible Processing Private Ltd, as it had quoted the lowest rate. ""The government was to decide on the matter long time back but it got delayed since it was taken to the court. A decision will now be taken as the court has passed an order in favour of the government,"" an official said. In March this year, the Meghalaya government had floated a tender to get a supplier for PDS sugar. Of the six bidders, the tendering committee found three firms eligible - Beta Edible Processing Private Ltd, which quoted Rs 54,270 per metric tonne for supply of sugar, SS Food Industries, which bid Rs 55,050 per metric tonne, and Dr Frozen Foods Indian Private Ltd, which quoted Rs 56,210 per metric tonne. One of the disqualified firms, Garden Courts Distilleries Private Ltd, appealed to the court to cancel the tender and stop the government from going ahead with the allotment of work order. It prayed to the court to recall the tender and bring changes in its clause 11, which states that the bidders should have a 1kg packing unit for sugar in Meghalaya or nearby for close monitoring of quality, packing and delivery of sugar. On May 25, the court passed a stay order in favour of the petitioner. But after hearing the matter and finding no merit in the writ petition, the court dismissed it on June 24, vacating the earlier order. The order passed by Justice S.R. Sen on June 24 stated, ""I do not find any reason to record that the clause is bad in any manner. Since it is also an admitted fact that the petitioner had no 1kg packing unit in the state of Meghalaya or nearby at the time of submitting the tender, the respondents authority (government) has rightly turned down his bid."" However, the Opposition National People's Party (NPP) has demanded a CBI probe into alleged anomalies in the tendering process. NPP legislator and party spokesperson James K. Sangma said since Beta Edibles Processing Private Ltd had been selected to supply sugar at a rate higher, the state government would have to shell out a higher subsidy at Rs 16.77 per kg. When the Meghalaya government had floated a tender in September last year, the bidders, Garden Court Distilleries Private Ltd had quoted Rs 44,351 per metric tonne, Beta Edible Processing Private Ltd had quoted Rs 44,440 per metric tonne, S.S. Food Industries had quoted Rs 44,570 per metric tonne and Dr Frozen Foods Indian Private Ltd had quoted Rs 45,610 per metric tonne. James said instead of selecting the lowest bidder, Garden Court Distilleries Private Ltd, the state government cancelled the tendering process on the ground that the rates received for the supply of PDS sugar were higher, after which a three-month extension was given to Kendriya Bhandar, another company, to supply sugar at Rs 43,270 per metric tonne. This included a central subsidy of Rs 18.50, state subsidy of Rs 5.77 and consumer's share of Rs 20 per kg.#Asked if sugar price would be hiked for consumers as Beta Edible Processing would supply sugar at Rs 54.27 per kg, the official said the government would work this out. ""Since the central subsidy is Rs 18.50 per kg, we will work out the amount to be charged from the consumers as well as the state subsidy,"" he said. He said any firm, selected by the government to supply sugar, should bear all costs, including that for transporting sugar to godowns in the districts, handling and packaging 1kg sugar in polybags along with state PDS logo. Consumers have not received PDS sugar for many months now since Kendriya Bhandar had supplied PDS sugar to Meghalaya only till December last year. The state's requirement for PDS sugar is 1,704 metric tonne per month. A total of 3kg sugar was distributed per ration card."

Over 50 addicts have been arrested in the state in the last fortnight following a cop crackdown triggered by media reports (see chart). Assam director-general of police Mukesh Sahay told The Telegraph, ""Assam fortunately lacks a proper drug network but the trend of addicts turning into peddlers is worrying. Besides, since the peddlers are not connected, we have to conduct our operations on a case by case basis which makes identification difficult."" Referring to the task force formed by the state government to look into the drug menace, the DGP said, ""The participation of all the departments is required because the enforcement department will only check the supply side but as long as there is demand in the state, the drug menace cannot be eradicated."" Explaining the modus operandi, a senior police official involved in the crackdown said, ""The suppliers are from the neighbouring states. They target people to get them addicted to drugs. However, it is not possible for a student or a middle class person to support drug addiction as the prices are prohibitive. The suppliers then ask the addicts to sell 10 or 12 pouches and get their quota for free."" Officials said the crackdown and subsequent interrogations had made it clear that no drug network is in place in the state. Some desperate addicts in order to support their addiction become peddlers. ""These addicts come to a point when they cannot get the money to buy the drugs. Hence they easily fall for the offer to peddle the substance in return for their daily fix,"" another official said. There has been a major drug haul in the state after a drug racket was busted by Guwahati police at Latasil based on media reports. Similar raids were also conducted in Dibrugarh and Silchar.More than 35 people were arrested in Guwahati under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and contraband valued at more than Rs 7 crore was seized. In Dibrugarh, eight arrests have been made and 70gm of brown sugar seized since May 4. The police claimed the crackdown had resulted in ""flight of peddlers"" from the Upper Assam town, including drug kingpin Elahi Seikh. Additional superintendent of police (security) Surjeet Singh Panesar said, ""Since we started the crackdown, most of those involved in drug racket have fled the town but there will be no let-up in our drive."" Last evening, the All Assam Students' Union took out a torchlight rally in Dibrugarh town, seeking action against those dealing in drugs. In Kokrajhar district, the United Democratic Students' Front, the All India United Democratic Youth Front and the All India United Democratic Front staged a protest today against the rising drug menace. They urged the district administration to take steps to free the district of addictive substances such as drugs and alcohol as it was destroying the lives of youths. A reformed addict, Dhiraj Kakati, who is now a volunteer at the Geetanagar-based Kripa Foundation's rehabilitation centre for drug addicts, said, ""The supply channel is not a problem. The problem is to control the demand. Consumption of drugs was earlier confined to the rich but widespread consumerism and a desire to relate to the rich has made drugs a commodity of desire among the middle class too."""

Telegraph picture Jorhat, May 16: Forget orange squash and mango pickle. Try kuji thekera or bor thekera squash and mirika tenga pickle instead. The food science and nutrition department of the College of Home Science here has come up with 60 delectable pickle, jam, sherbet and mouth-freshener recipes made from 13 lesser-known fruits of Assam, which are disappearing from the market. Former associate professor of the department and guest faculty Nilima Neog said the aim was to add value to the fruits like mirika tenga (Parameria polyneura), noga tenga (nutgall) (Rhus semialata), thereju (Prunus jenkinsii), bor thekera (Garcinia padanculata), rupohi thekera (Garcinia lanceaefolia), kuji thekera (Garciniia cowa roxb), pora amlakhi (Phylanthus acidus), leteku (Baccaurea sapida), ou tenga (elephant apple) (Dillenia indicus), bogori (Indian date) (Ziziphus jujube), poniol (coffee plum) (Flacourtia gangomos), kordoi (star fruit) (Avvehorea carambola) and nuni (mulberry) (Morus australispoir) so that people keep on growing them and make products which they can sell. Neog, who is working on the Rs 65.93 lakh project, is a recipient of the Dr J.S. Pruthi award for the best article published in the Food Packers Journal 2006-07 in which she had made five products from mirika tenga. ""The next generation, especially in urban areas, has probably not seen the pora amlakhi, kuji thekera, leteku and thereju. These trees have all but disappeared, though aamlakhi (Indian gooseberry) can be found in plenty,"" Neog said. Earlier, many of these trees were found in gardens as people generally believed that they had therapeutic value for stomach ailments, cough and common cold and kordoi in jaundice, she said. ""Nowadays, however, people rely more on allopathic medicines and the fruits like kordoi, the juice of which was believed to be very good for the liver, is no longer sought,"" she added. ""All the minor fruits we have selected are rich in vitamin C, ascorbic acid and other nutrients. Once we give out the recipes, they can be taken up for small-scale production and add to the income of a family,"" she said. Neog said in order to standardise the process, certain tests to find out the amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) present in each fruit, its moisture content total soluble solids, PH value, protein, carbohydrates, anti-oxidants, acidity and total sugar were conducted. Tests to find out the value of nutrients like iron, potassium or calcium, however, had not been undertaken. Neog said she and senior research fellow of the department, Barnali Baruah, developed nearly 100 odd products of which 60 have been approved for transfer of technology by a panel of experts after taking into cognisance flavour, taste and colour. ""We not only standardised the processes according to the quality set by Indian Standard Specification but also undertook acceptability studies and evaluated shelf life,"" she said. Among the products are toffees made of bogori (berry) and tamarind pulp, mouth freshener from pora amlakhi and a powder made from ou tenga (elephant apple) which can be had like chutney or put into other dishes like lentils or curries for flavour. They can also be made into squashes, jams and pickles.

Pictures by Hardeep Singh Jharkhand's 'river of gold' is spewing pills in a fresh and alarming pointer to rampant pollution of water bodies in a state where ignorance and indifference are strange bedfellows. More than 15kg of medicines - mostly for curbing high blood sugar - were found abandoned on Tuesday morning near rocks that dot the tapering Subernarekha in Namkum, Ranchi. The shocking discovery was made by a group of citizen crusaders, who under the banner of Swarnarekha Utthan Samiti, were voluntarily cleaning the river. The biomedical waste - fortunately, non-infected - were packed in polythene shopping bags of retail giant Big Bazaar and sunk half into water. Another stash of lose packets were strewn on the banks under Namkum bridge. ""To many, these medicines may look harmless, but they are actually capable of doing great damage to the river. Biochemical trash, especially any cytotoxic drug, needs to be treated and disposed of in secure land filling. We have fished out two bags, but there may have been more. If the pills got dissolved in water, they can harm aquatic life. Cattle drinking water from the river may suffer too,"" said Sudhir Kumar Sharma (32), an environment journalist who launched the morning cleaning campaign last month. Sharma maintained that most of the medicines recovered were past their expiry date while some were due to expire in December this year. ""I got them checked by a medicine dealer. These pills are primarily for high blood sugar and were mostly distributed by Jokhiram Pharmaceuticals. Either an inconsiderate medical representative or an agency dumped the stocks in the river,"" he said. The river crusader added that during their routine morning cleaning from 5.30am, they often chanced upon used syringes and bandages, which are infectious biomedical waste, but this was the first time pills were found and that too in such enormous quantities. ""The stock looks fresh and may have been dumped within a day or two."" Incidentally, Jharkhand never had a proper biomedical waste disposal system in its 16 years of existence and despite frequent high court reminders. State pollution watchdog JSPCB, civic guardians and hospitals seem to care precious little about all the mess. All that the JSPCB has done till date is float expressions of interest and tenders scouting for specialised agencies, but all in vain. Last year, following a court order, the chief secretary's office had directed the Ranchi Municipal Corporation and Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) to jointly work on the matter. The RMC was required to prepare tender clauses while the RIMS was supposed to float tenders and oversee execution. A couple of rounds of tenders were floated, but no suitable bidders were apparently found. In the wake of this tender jinx and bureaucratic red tape, disposal of biomedical waste continues to remain a neglected affair in the face of mushrooming clinics and hospitals. ""Some big hospitals have their own incinerators, but most litter trash here and there. Regulating that practice is a tough job. There is one agency in Ramgarh that deals with disposal of biomedical waste, but one is too less for the whole state,"" remarked a candid staff at the civil surgeon's office in Ranchi. On Tuesday's river haul, he said they would try to track down the culprits. ""They can be traced using serial numbers on the medicines,"" he added, requesting anonymity."
58fef97b7be9e0420db2a818,Retail prices harden,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160513/jsp/business/story_85287.jsp,2016-05-13,"New Delhi, May 12: Retail inflation broke a recent slowing trend in April, reducing the odds of further interest rate cuts next month by the Reserve Bank of India. Consumer price inflation, which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) targets in setting interest rates, rose at a faster-than-expected 5.39 per cent last month from 4.83 per cent in March. It was the first pickup in retail inflation since January. The pace of price gains in April was driven mainly by higher food costs. An early summer heat wave has led to an increase of 3.8 per cent in month-on-month prices for staple vegetables. Overall retail food inflation came in at 6.32 per cent, compared with 5.21 per cent in March. Economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das said the spike in retail inflation was because of a ""higher base effect and they are within the RBI's comfort zone"". He expects prices to remain stable going forward. However, on sugar prices, which jumped 11.18 per cent he said, ""The sugar sector needs long-term reform measures."" Aditi Nayar, senior economist with rating agency Icra, said, ""The drought like conditions in several districts are unlikely to allow a respite in food inflation until the monsoon rains cover a significant portion of the country. ""Notwithstanding the dismal performance of the manufacturing sector in March 2016, the uptick in headline as well as core CPI inflation in April 2016 has reduced the likelihood of a rate cut in the upcoming policy, unless the onset of monsoon delivers a positive surprise."" Food inflation rose to 6.32 per cent in April against 5.21 per cent in March, data released by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) today showed. ""We expect another month or two of firming up of prices. It would, therefore, be very critical to make an assessment of the monsoon arrival and its performance thereafter. We definitely have pencilled in a rate cut of 25 bps in the first half. ""We have not been driven to change our call for June rate cut because these numbers could well be in the realm of possibility for the RBI,"" said Shubhada Rao, chief economist, Yes Bank."
