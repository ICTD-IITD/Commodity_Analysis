",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160818/jsp/jharkhand/story_102962.jsp,2016-08-18,"The decked-up Parsi temple on Straight Mile Road in Jamshedpur on Wednesday. Picture by Bhola Prasad It was a very special Navroz or New Year for Parsis settled in India on Wednesday. Though Parsis the world over observe Navroz on March 21 according to the Zoroastrian calendar, those in India celebrate another new year according to the Shenshai calendar they adapted after settling in Gujarat during the 8th or 10th centuries. But, the celebrations, including customs and rituals, are same in both, said young Parsi entrepreneur Varun Gazder in Jamshedpur. ""We celebrated Navroz with our family,"" Varun said. ""We go to the agiary (Parsi fire temple) in the morning for special prayers but some of our friends and family walk in anytime to seek blessings."" Like the Gazder family, the 180-odd Parsi community in Jamshedpur started the day by praying at the agiary or fire temple on Straight Mile Road, which was decked up for the occasion, then met up with friends and loved ones to wish each other Navroz Mubarak. Then came the feasting, one of the enduring passions of the community. Delicacies such as dhansak, sevaiyan and sooji ka halwa were must-haves on the festive platter. Spicy dhansak, a popular Parsi delicacy, is prepared by cooking mutton with a mixture of lentils and vegetables and is then served with caramelised brown rice. At the Parsi Hostel in Sakchi, meritorious students and achievers were also felicitated. A cultural programme was also organised where schsool students performed. Eminent Parsi educator Nargis Madon, the director of JH Tarapore School, explained the significance of this Navroz. ""When the community migrated to India, their first settlement was in Sanjan, Gujarat. The king of Sanjan, Jadav Rana (also known as Jadi Rana) showed the Parsis a bowl of milk symbolising that his kingdom was full. A Parsi priest asked for sugar and stirred it in the milk without spilling a drop So, Parsis, as you see, blended with the local people very peacefully and sweetly,"" Madon smiled."
58fefd4a7be9e0420db2ae07,U-turn in wholesale prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160517/jsp/business/story_86015.jsp,2016-05-17,"New Delhi, May 16: India's wholesale prices unexpectedly rose for the first time in 18 months, posting a gain of 0.34 per cent, driven up by higher costs for food and manufactured items. In March, prices fell a provisional 0.85 per cent. Wholesale food prices last month rose 4.23 per cent year-on-year compared with a provisional 3.73 per cent gain in March. Prices of manufactured goods increased 0.71 per cent year-on-year in April. Fuel prices dropped 4.83 per cent from a year earlier, slower than a provisional 8.30 per cent fall in March. Inflation in vegetables came in at 2.21 per cent compared with (-)2.26 per cent in March this year, while the same in pulses was high at 36.36 per cent against 34.45 per cent in March. Aditi Nayar, senior economist with rating agency Icra, said, ""The delay in the onset of the monsoon as forecast by the IMD would prolong the seasonal hardening in food prices. ""Although a delayed onset does not necessarily signal a lagged progress of rainfall across the country, food prices are likely to ease only after a substantial area receives precipitation. The continued hardening of crude prices would also exert upward pressure on the WPI in the ongoing month."" ""With the forecast of a delayed onset of the monsoon compounding the concerns arising from the uptick in CPI and WPI inflation in April 2016, we expect the RBI would leave the policy rate unchanged in the upcoming policy review,"" she said. While WPI inflation continues to be soft, a delay in monsoon rains coupled with the rise in CPI inflation to 5.39 per cent in April from 4.83 per cent in March reduces the chances of the RBI cutting rates in the near term. Richa Gupta, senior economist at Deloitte India, said: ""Inflation at the wholesale level printing in at a positive number almost rules out chances of monetary easing in the near term, especially after retail inflation also registered a higher-than-expected level last week."" ""On the food side there were some alarming signals as pulses saw an increase of close to 4 per cent from the previous month, showing that supply constraints in certain pockets can lead to flaring up of food inflation. ""Prices of manufactured products rose on the back of increases in global commodity prices and a rise in sugar price on the back of expected shortages in the market. The number still remains low and given the outlook on commodity prices, expect WPI to remain low,"" Gupta said. The index of industrial production (IIP) slowed to 0.1 per cent in March from 2 per cent in February as manufacturing fell 0.1 per cent, while mining fell 0.1 per cent and electricity was up 11.3 per cent. During 2015-16, IIP rose just 2.4 per cent with manufacturing expanding by 2 per cent, mining 2.2 per cent and electricity 5.6 per cent. Harshavardhan Neotia, president of Ficci, said: ""While some price pressure is noted in case of select food items, we don't foresee any significant change in the near term in the inflation trajectory. While the latest monsoon forecast shows a delay by about a week, we hope that the meteorological department's overall prediction will hold and would provide reprieve in the months ahead"". ""While the RBI has been keeping a close watch on the ground situation, we hope to see a more accommodative stance in the June policy announcement,"" Neotia said."

The Shiv Sena had to make do with two junior ministers, which created a perception that it was unhappy. Reports had said the Sena would get a better deal in the state cabinet expansion since it was ignored during the Union cabinet expansion earlier this week. Five of the new inductees got cabinet rank, five were brought in as junior ministers and one junior minister was promoted to cabinet rank. Allaying the perception that he was sulking, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, who skipped the swearing-in, said in Mumbai the cabinet expansion was done on the lines of what had long been mutually agreed upon. Reports had, however, indicated that the Sena had been lobbying hard to get at least one cabinet berth. But Uddhav said today: ""We never demanded a cabinet berth."" He claimed rival parties, unhappy with the Sena being part of the government, were spreading canards that his party was discontented. The Sena's Anant Geete is the Union heavy industries minister. Uddhav's long-time loyalists, Gulabrao Patil and Arjun Khotkar, took oath along with two members of the BJP's smaller allies, Mahadev Jankar and Sadabhau Khot. Jankar is a Dhangar community leader from Sharad Pawar's Baramati citadel and runs an outfit called Rashtriya Samaj Paksh. Khot, a farm activist, comes from western Maharashtra's sugar lobby and belongs to the Swawlambi Shetkari Sanghatna, a faction of the erstwhile Shetkari Sanghatna of the late Sharad Joshi. Jankar was inducted as a cabinet minister and Khot as a junior minister. Fadnavis also inducted the BJP veteran from western Vidarbha, Pandurang Phundkar, into his cabinet, promoted a junior minister to cabinet rank and inducted four new faces from his party. Phundkar, who hails from Khamgaon in Akola, is a former BJP Maharashtra president and was leader of Opposition in the legislative council during the late Vilasrao Deshmukh's tenure as chief minister."
58fefe317be9e0420db2af57,Campaign kick-off at anniversary rally,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160527/jsp/nation/story_87901.jsp,2016-05-27,"Saharanpur, May 26: Narendra Modi had celebrated his first year in office under a withering sun, addressing a public meeting in Nagla Chandrabhan near Mathura. That was on May 25 last year. Modi had then spotlighted his government's ""achievements"", using a stock-in-trade in his campaign repertory of engaging the crowd in a Q&A session. This year, in equally blistering heat, he chose a town in western Uttar Pradesh to mark the NDA government's second anniversary and virtually converted the rally into a launch pad for the state elections, scheduled in early 2017. If Assam was a tonic to rev up the BJP after a drought induced by electoral losses in 2015, Saharanpur gave an added fillip to Modi. The people who packed the capacious ground of the Cosmos Green Society on the Saharanpur-Delhi road needed no prompting from Modi to answer his queries, unlike last year's largely apathetic listeners. The Prime Minister had barely said ""Is there a taint of corruption against my government"", when the audience shouted ""No, no."" The purported absence of scams against his dispensation - that he contrasted with the UPA regime ""when corruption cases tumbled out one after another"" - was touted as a big ""hit"". However, Modi's address focused largely on issues exercising western Uttar Pradesh, like the indebtedness suffered by sugarcane growers because of non-payment of dues over several years by sugar mills, including cooperatives and private mills. ""Nothing was done to resolve the issue. My government has cleared Rs 14,000 crore of the Rs 22,000 crore of outstandings. We hope to clear the rest soon. I appeal to the state governments and I warn the sugar mill owners not to repeat what they have been doing all these years,"" Modi said. Home minister Rajnath Singh, who also spoke, noted that several cane growers in Uttar Pradesh had switched over to raising poplar trees. ""I assure you if our government comes, many sugarcane farmers will go back to growing their original crop,"" the BJP veteran, a Rajput from the state and a former chief minister, said. Modi reminded the crowd of a promise he had made when he was elected Prime Minister. ""Prime ministership is an institution created to run a system of governance. My duty is to be your prime 'sevak' (servant). Governments come and go, elections happen all the time. But to me a government is there to fulfil people's dreams, aspirations,"" Modi, whose Lok Sabha constituency is Varanasi, said. ""I have tried to express my conviction in my government's work over the last two years,"" he added. ""In my first speech (as Prime Minister) I said I have dedicated my government to the poor. One step after another we have taken is intended to empower the poor to fight poverty and win the battle. Because no poor parent wants to bequeath a legacy of impoverishment to his or her progenies."" Among the other ""achievements"" Modi spotlighted was reversing fund-sharing between the Centre and the states in order to make the states more financially robust. As Modi and Rajnath emphasised that their Uttar Pradesh discourse would be dominated by development, the congregation signalled its priority, repeatedly chanting "" Jai Shri Ram"" and ""Bharat Mata ki Jai""."
58fefe527be9e0420db2af8f,Exit plan on UB brewery mind,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160731/jsp/bihar/story_99687.jsp,2016-07-31,"Patna, July 30: The UB Group is mulling closing down its brewery in Bihar. This comes after the Bangalore-headquartered United Spirits Limited (USL) announced earlier this week that they had decided to shut down their distillery located at Hatidah on the Patna outskirts. The USL is a part of the UB Group with its headquarters at the UB Tower in Bangalore. Sources in the brewery, which was set up at a cost of around Rs 270 crore and became operational last year, told The Telegraph that with most of the brewery employees either laid off or transferred, the company was in touch with Praj, a Pune-based company, experts in setting up brewery plants. ""In the current scenario of prohibition, the brewery has been defunct since two months now. Though a final decision regarding the same is to be taken by the board of directors of the company, we are mulling an exit. A Pune-based company called Praj has been contacted who expertise in setting up breweries. At this moment, nothing more can be said as the final decision on the shifting and the new state to shift the brewery is yet to be decided,"" an official told The Telegraph. The official pointed out that setting up the brewery in a different state was being given a serious thought. ""The breweries of UB are located in many states in the country. So, if the brewery shuts down here, it has to be planned properly as to which state it would be transferred to. The problem with here is the land at Naubatpur, around 30km from Patna, on which the brewery has been established. Unlike the other breweries like that of Carlsberg and Molson Coors Cobra, we have been given the land on lease by Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (Biada) for 99 years. Though I am not aware of the amount paid to the government for the land, the company had to fight a tough and bitter battle in court after the farmers and landowners started protesting. In addition to paying Biada, the company had to pay the farmers too,"" the official said. The Biada, a wing under the state industries department, had decided to acquire 96 acres for industrial purposes at Naubatpur in 2011 and the UB Group had been given 42 acres for the brewery. Of 42 acres transferred to the UB group, about 13 acres belonged to 27 farmers who later approached the court for quashing the acquisition and subsequently the lease deed of the company. One of their allegations was that the state government had acquired land from them by promising a sugar factory but then had given land to UB for a brewery. On July 6, 2012, Patna High Court cleared the hurdles in the way of UB. ""The advantage with the other breweries lies that they bought land from the landowners directly and set up the brewery. So, if at all they decided to wind up, they can sell off the land and in this way, can balance the losses. In the case of UB, there is no such chance. We have been told that it would take anything between Rs 35 to 40 crore to shift the entire brewery,"" the official said, adding that presently, there were just four people working in the brewery. When it started to function, there were 70 people in the brewery and 75 in the sales team. The brewery has the capacity to manufacture 10 lakh cases of beer each month. In talks with The Telegraph earlier, the representatives of Carlsberg, which has a brewery at Bikram, around 24km away from Patna, had said that in view of the tremendous investment made in the state, the prohibition would have an impact on business. The Danish company has invested around Rs 140 crore towards the setting up of the brewery."

58feff477be9e0420db2b0ed,'Touching the Lord is not a sin',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160709/jsp/odisha/story_95661.jsp,2016-07-09,"Pulling of chariots was delayed despite all co-operation provided by the administration. Being the president of the Daitapati Niyog, should you not be blamed for the delay? Yes, there was a delay in the pulling of chariots. Hundreds of people are engaged in the car festival. Sometimes, the lack of co-ordination is the cause behind the delay. During this year's car festival, there had been a delay in fitting of the chaarmal (ladders) to the chariots. This had also led to the delay in bringing the deities out of the shrine. Unless the chaarmal is fitted, the deities cannot go atop the chariots. Besides, many servitors who had no duty near the deities during the pahendi vije (the procession in which Lord comes out from the temple), remained glued to the Trinity. As the event was being telecast live, the servitors did not want to leave the place near the deities, thereby creating problems in the pahendi vije. During the bahuda yatra, we will try to ensure that all these things are avoided and car pulling goes smoothly. Though there is a court order forbidding any one from touching the deities, we noticed how the devotees touched Lord Jagannath on the day of the rath yatra. Even prior to rath yatra on July 6, the devotees had touched the deities on the snana mandap on June 20. Should not the niyog be held responsible for this? The high court order speaks of debarring devotees to mount the chariots and touching the deities there. The court has remained silent on the issue of whether the devotees should touch the deities during the pahendi vije or not. On the other hand, no attempt should be made to create a barrier between Lord Jagannath and its devotees. He is the god who manifests love. Even Puri king Dibya Singh Deb and Gobardhan Peetha Shankaracharya are of the view that devotees should not be allowed to touch the deities and touching the deity is a sin. Do you agree with the view? Why don't you try to understand the Jagannath culture? He is our family member. He is a living deity, the jianta thakur (living God). Though I have all regards for Shanakaracharya and the king, in my opinion, no barrier should be made between the god and his devotees. He is known as patitapaban (the lord who saves the helpless). No attempt should be made to take the deities away from the devotees. I don't subscribe to the views that touching the Lord is a sin. But keeping the security aspect in mind, there should be some regulation. The devotees should not be allowed to mount the chariot on the day of rath yatra and suna besha (the day when the deities are adorned with gold). On other days during the yatra, the devotees should be allowed to mount chariots for a restricted time period. As this matter is sub-judice, I don't want to comment much on it. The daitapatis are opposing the move as most of you earn money during the rath yatra by facilitating the devotees' darshan and later allowing them to touch the deities... These are all baseless allegations. You would be surprised to know that those devotees, who come from far-flung areas of state as well as from outside, are mostly poor. We never expect any money from them. Here, the devotee comes to see his Lord purely out of devotion and his love for the God brings him to the town. The Nabakalebar of the Trinity got over last year. But the controversy surrounding the Brahma Paribaratan (transfer of soul) is still haunting the minds of devotees. The devotees were shocked to find that transfer of souls had taken place in the evening and not at midnight. Let me clarify that only the transfer of souls was delayed but nothing had happened with the Brahma. In 1996, the transfer of souls had taken place around 5pm and in 1977, it had been done around 7pm. In this case, our servitors, who are unable to handle the media, gave some contradictory statements after coming out of the shrine and that led to the controversy. On the other hand, one cannot say when the souls would be transferred. We are His instruments and we cannot dictate Him. Also, there is always a dense darkness inside the sanctum sanctorum. Once you enter the area, you have no idea how time passes away. We had completed all the rituals in dim light. God will decide when He will take birth. But why did the temple administration suspend two servitors? After getting conflicting reports, the administration had to act and they suspended two servitors. Later, it withdrew the suspension order and allowed them to take part in the rath yatra this year. There are allegations that the temple administration had withdrawn the suspension order as both of the servitors are close to you. One of them is also the member of the BJD... The temple administration had inquired into the incidents leading to delay in transfer of souls and cross-examined a number of servitors. The administration had realised that they had done nothing wrong. The Daitapati Niyog had urged the administration to withdraw the suspension order. Last year, you had courted controversy by allowing ministers and MLAs to enter to the restricted area where preparation had been made to do the puja of a tree that was to be cut and later taken to Puri for the construction of idols. I did not commit any mistake. The ministers and MLAs who came to me at that time came as devotees. Besides, we had to discuss with the administration about the route through which the tree would be taken and where the vehicle carrying it would be halted for the public so that they could offer their puja to the "" darubrahma."" Had it been so, why did people put up your poster and blackened your face in them? Anyone can put anybody's poster. But that does not mean that people don't like you. I still get hundreds of letters from different parts of the state appreciating my role during the Nabakalebar. I still remember the day when I had to embark on a journey with others. On that day, my blood sugar level had touched 360. But that did not deter my spirit. It seems everyone is trying to take credit from the sentiments attached to Lord Jagannath. Don't you feel everyone is playing politics over Lord Jagannath? In every party - whether it is the BJP, Congress or the BJD -every one is trying to take political mileage from this issue. Let me clarify that those who try to take political mileage will be finished one day. You are from the BJD. By saying that the BJD is trying to take mileage, are not you inviting problems for yourself? Yes, the BJD here is in the government. Naturally, it has to play a major role in the smooth conduct of the functioning of the temple. When we notice others are trying to drag Lord Jagannath into politics, the government and party has no other option but to take action accordingly. Odisha has never witnessed division on caste lines. Don't you think there is an attempt to divide the society on these lines and there could be a crisis emerging with Lord Jagannath in focus? Yes, I have noticed it. Attempts are being made to divide the state on the basis of caste. Everyone is trying to drag Lord Jagannath into it. This is really unfortunate. Question marks are being raised on the safety of the temple. The ASI team has already visited the team. How far has the repair work proceeded? We had made a blunder by handing over our temple to the ASI in 1974. Now, we have no option but to live with what they decide. We had limestone plaster covering the entire structure. But in the name of beautification, they have played havoc with it and de-plastered it. They forget that people here don't come to see the temple structure and its beautification. For that purpose, we have the Konark temple. Here people come to have a darshan of the Lord and not to see the beauty of the temple. What can be done at this moment? We should shift the Trinity to the Mausima temple for two or three months as we had done in 1894. Then we should undertake a complete repair of the temple. I have already given a proposal to the temple administration to this effect, but they are yet to respond to it. You are a servitor. From where do you get all these gold ornaments to wear? Don't you feel scared to wear them all during the car festival when lakhs of people congregate? I have inherited the gold ornaments from my ancestors. There are ornaments that are 500 years old. As the grand car festival is associated with our brother, we put on new clothes and wear all the gold ornaments. I have no fear in wearing them."
58feff897be9e0420db2b159,Diabetes guides add to medicine benefits,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160714/jsp/nation/story_96618.jsp,2016-07-14,"New Delhi, July 13: Simple but well-crafted, periodic guidance to diabetes patients from non-physician care coordinators, when added to standard treatment, may help them achieve better blood sugar control than medications alone, a multi-city study from India suggests. The findings demonstrate an intervention that does not require any new or expensive drugs but enhances patients' likelihood of managing their diabetes better through support from trained non-doctor health workers, the doctors who conducted the study say. Patients who received such guidance showed significant improvements in blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels that would reduce their risk of developing serious diabetes complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, eye disease and limb amputations. ""This was a real-life study. It shows a pragmatic intervention relevant to India's burgeoning diabetes problem and replicable on a large scale,"" Nikhil Tandon, professor of endocrinology at AIIMS, New Delhi, and one of the study's coordinators, told The Telegraph. Endocrinologists estimate that India has over 60 million patients with diabetes, a figure expected to rise above 80 million by 2025. Medical studies suggest that only three in 10 diabetes patients in India manage to keep their sugar levels at desired levels. ""Glucose control (even among patients with diagnosed diabetes who take regular medications) is poor and there have been no major improvements in this situation over the past 10 to 15 years,"" Tandon said. In their study, doctors from diabetes clinics in Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai and other cities picked 1,146 patients and offered 575 of them special non-physician intervention in addition to standard care. They then compared these patients' progress with the remaining 571 who had received only standard care. Their results, published this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine, showed that twice as many patients who had received non-physician intervention achieved the desired blood sugar levels compared with those who received only standard care. ""We've not added anything new. What needs to be done was implemented in an efficient way,"" said Dorairaj Prabhakaran, a senior cardiologist and director of the New Delhi-based Centre for Chronic Disease Control who was another coordinator of the study. ""The non-physician care coordinators serve as the interface between doctors and patients,"" Prabhakaran said. ""Doctors are often busy and unable to provide adequate and detailed lifestyle guidance to patients, which the care coordinators were tasked to do."" The care coordinators used a computer-based system to track patients' records, document their needs and remind them of future follow-up visits with doctors, and provided regular guidance on diet, exercise and tobacco reduction, among other advisories. The researchers say their results are all the more significant because the study did not financially support any component of diabetes care. This ensured that the patients were not in any way incentivised to play along with their care coordinators. ""The patients were expected to come on their own for blood tests and review by doctors; they had to pay for their blood tests, medication and, for those attending private clinics, the consultation fees of doctors,"" Tandon said. The care coordinators were non-physicians, trained in allied health fields such as dietetics or social work with less than six months' experience in the health-care sector. They were able to join the study with only three days' training."

The court granted 25-day protection from arrest to Mishra, his wife Ashamanjari and son Sabyasachi, who had also sought anticipatory bail in the case registered against them at Mahila police station in Bhubaneswar. On the basis of Lopamudra's complaint, the police had registered a case under sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 294 (obscene act), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The case is pending before the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Bhubaneswar. The anticipatory bail pleas were moved on the ground that the allegations had been ""false"" and made 10 years after marriage. Besides, no dowry related allegations were made. ""After a preliminary hearing, the single-judge bench of Justice S.K. Mishra ordered for production of the case diary on July 29 while granting Mishra, Ashamanjari and Sabyasachi interim protection till then,"" Mishra's counsel Sidheswar Mohanty said.

She alleged that her husband had been torturing her for all these years, but her in-laws had remained silent. He never gave her money to spend and even ignored his son. Whenever she opposed him, he assaulted her, she alleged. She also alleged that her husband had tried to force her to agree to wife-swapping during their honeymoon in the Andamans, and when she resisted, he beat her up. Whenever she complained to her father-in-law, he would tell her that such incidents were normal in wealthy families. Her in-laws have always supported her husband and his assaults on her. They also said nothing when he beat me up, Lopamudra alleged in her complaint. The interim protection from the high court comes a week after the police issued a ""lookout notice"" against Mishra, his wife and son. Apprehending that they were planning to flee abroad, the police issued the lookout circular to all airports in the country with a direction to put it up in international airports."

Lopamudra (36) has also alleged that her husband Sabyasachi Mishra had tried to force her to agree to wife swapping a few days after their wedding in 2006. ""Since we got married on January 27, 2006, my husband has had many extramarital affairs. When I expressed opposition, he assaulted me. During our honeymoon in the Andamans he forced me to agree to wife swapping and when I resisted, he beat me up badly,"" Lopamudra alleged. She also alleged that her in-laws had supported her husband. ""He has been torturing me for a decade and my in-laws stayed silent. He never gives me money to spend and even ignores his son. Whenever I oppose him, he assaults me,"" said Lopamudra, an arts graduate. She alleged that she visited Kharvela Nagar police station to lodge a formal complaint in April this year. ""After I reached the police station, he somehow managed to dissuade me and brought me back with him. But the very next day, he assaulted me again which led to a fracture in my ear. He also threatened me with dire consequences if I visited the police station again,"" she said. Lopamudra has also visited Madhyam (a woman support centre) in 2015 and counsellors brought them to a mutual reconciliation.

They would say nothing when he beat me up,"" Lopamudra said. Deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi said a case had been registered on the basis of the complaint filed by Lopamudra. ""I have also asked the investigating officer to expedite the investigation process. We are analysing material evidence too,"" said Bhoi. Sabyasachi and his father Trailokya were not available for their comments. Police have registered a case under sections 498-A, 323, 294, 506 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, May 13: Assam police are coordinating with at least five states to choke the supply channels of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances in the state. Assam director-general of police Mukesh Sahay said his department has contacted the police of Bihar, Punjab and Haryana in the west and Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur in the Northeast after the recent drug hauls in the state. ""According to our information, the contraband substances come from these states. So we have informed their police departments. We will coordinate with these states to thwart the supply channels,"" he told The Telegraph here today. ""It is a routine we follow whenever we seize contraband substances - we try to track its origin and destination. Based on that, we inform the states concerned and launch operations in coordination with them,"" he added. ""At times it is hard to identify the channel of the substances from the statement of the apprehended addict or peddler. We then go by the nature of the substance to find its origin,"" the DGP said. ""Synthetic drugs enter the state from Punjab and Haryana. Brown sugar, an adulterated form of heroin, comes from Bihar which procures the opium from Bhutan and processes it into brown sugar. Brown sugar and heroin are also produced in the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur and the neighbouring country of Myanmar. Cannabis ( ganja) is mostly produced in the hill states of India and in Nepal. We identify the products according to their origin and proceed with the investigation,"" Sahay said. Assam police began a major crackdown after a section of citizens helped it bust a drug racket at Latasil here about a fortnight ago. This resulted in a major drug haul in the city, in Silchar and in Dibrugarh district. Contraband valued at more than Rs 7 crore was seized. Over 50 persons across Assam, 35 of them from the city, were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Three persons, believed to be close aides of Upper Assam's drug kingpin Elahi Sekh, who is still absconding, were apprehended from Kalibari area of Dibrugarh town along with 12gm brown sugar on Wednesday. C.K. Boro, officer-in-charge of Dibrugarh police station, said, ""Sekh's network of drug peddlers primarily comprises women and school dropouts. He channels drugs into Dibrugarh through postal courier, after which peddlers distribute it in Upper Assam and to Arunachal Pradesh through waterways and roadways. After the crackdown, Sekh has fled Dibrugarh but we are trying our best to arrest him."" A police source said brown sugar is smuggled from Buxar district of Bihar through trains and buses. ""Pantry cars in trains are the soft targets of the drug network,"" he said. A task force, headed by the additional chief secretary of the home department T.Y. Das, was formed on Wednesday to address the drug problem. Today, the All Assam Students Union, which had been raising its voice against the drug menace in the state since the Latasil haul, organised bike rallies in Bongaigaon town as well as in Jonai, Silapathar, Dhemaji and Gogamukh - four major towns of Dhemaji district. After the rally, it submitted a memorandum to the Bongaigaon deputy commissioner, urging him to take action against drug traffickers and abusers. ""We want the district authority to take action against drug abusers and peddlers. Awareness must be spread among the people against narcotics abuse,"" Birkumar Adhikary, a leader of the AASU's Bongaigaon unit, said.

Ethanol or ethyl alcohol is one of the main types of alcohol used to produce liquor beverages. Distilleries produce it using molasses obtained from sugar mills. ""The Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas accepted the Bihar government's request after due consideration and consultation with oil marketing companies, which estimated that around 6 crore litres of ethanol could be produced in the state through molasses,"" a Patna-based senior Indian Oil Corporation Limited official told The Telegraph on condition of anonymity. ""Oil marketing companies have expressed willingness to absorb ethanol for the ethanol blended petrol (EBP) programme to help the state, especially its agriculture sector. The initiative will provide around Rs 300 crore to farmers, sugar mills and distilleries in Bihar and ensure proper utilisation of molasses."" The Centre runs an EBP programme in 21 states including Bihar and four Union territories. Around five per cent of ethanol is mixed with petrol and the Centre's immediate target is to achieve 10 per cent blending in petrol. The Centre's decision to lift ethanol has come as a relief for the state, which was worried about proper utilisation of molasses and ethanol or spirits falling in the wrong hands after prohibition. Two distilleries at Harinagar and Narkatiaganj in West Champaran district and one at Riga in Sitamarhi district produce ethanol by lifting molasses from sugar mills. ""It is a welcome move by the Union ministry,"" excise deputy superintendent Satyendra Kumar Sinha said. ""Though it has agreed to the state government's proposal, how much ethanol they procure will depend on oil marketing companies. Distilleries will have to apply at tenders floated by them."" Satyendra said more molasses-based distilleries would start functioning. Thus the state would be able to produce more ethanol, which may lead to upward revision in estimated production of ethanol. ""It would be even better if the Centre purchases all ethanol produced by them,"" he said. Union ministry figures say ethanol supplies were enough to meet just 30 per cent of the blending requirement and during sugar year 2013-14 (October to September), only 38 crore litres could be supplied for the programme."

We will submit a memorandum to Dibrugarh deputy commissioner to take action against the drug mafia,'' Dibrugarh KMSS president Pradip Haloi. ""It is a threat to the young generation as it ruins their career and it's their family which suffers the most,'' he added. Today, Dibrugarh police apprehended one drug peddler from Marwari Patty, identified as Raju Ahmed, a resident of Panchali. The police recovered 20gm of brown sugar from him. On May 16, 2012 drug kingpin Elahi Sheikh was arrested from his residence at Chandmari with 1kg of brown sugar. Earlier, he was arrested in 2010 under the Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Act but he got bail. Dibrugarh superintendent of police Vir Vikram Gogoi told The Telegraph that they were trying to bust the drug racket in the district. ""Drugs rackets are not new in Dibrugarh.

58ff0a547be9e0420db2bb7c,Twin towers of Darjeeling,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160511/jsp/siliguri/story_84925.jsp,2016-05-11,"Darjeeling, May 10: Darjeeling's most famous landmark, the Capitol Clock Tower, is set to get a replica but the new one will not be chiming to the tune of Big Ben in London. The Rotary Club of Darjeeling has decided to set up the new clock tower at Chowk Bazar as the old one on Ladenla Road is no longer visible from all parts of town because of mushrooming of concrete structures. Rotary Clock Tower will be acting as a fire fighting unit with a water tank and fire extinguishers. The turret clock at the Capitol Hall, set up by Darjeeling municipality in the early 1920s, was one of the most visible landmarks in town until the skyline changed with the construction of high rises. This is not to say that the tower is no longer a landmark in Darjeeling. ""When we were small, we could see the clock from most parts of the town. This is not possible now. So, we decided to replicate the clock tower and set it up at Chowk Bazar, one of the places from where the tower was visible earlier,"" said Tashi Pencho, the project chairman of Rotary Club of Darjeeling. However, the new tower will not be seen from all parts of town either. ""The replica will have four clocks facing four directions. There will also be space to store at least 12,000 liters of water and about 20-30 fire extinguishers so that the tower can act as a centre of response in case of emergencies,"" said Suresh Periwal, the president of the club. In the past five years, there have been at least four major fire incidents within a 200m radius of the spot where the clock tower is coming up. ""Since it will take time for fire engines to reach town from Dali, situated 5km from Darjeeling, the water and the extinguishers should be of immense help. We are planning to train volunteers from all 32 wards of Darjeeling on how to use the fire extinguishers. The keys will be kept probably at the police station,"" said Pencho. Pencho had played an instrumental role in repairing the clock at the Capitol Hall in 2006. The renovation had also been funded by the Rotary Club that spent Rs 1.5 lakh. The clock had stopped working since the mid 1980s. ""We plan to start the Rotary Clock Tower project from Monday. We are looking at completing the project in six months. The total cost is likely to touch Rs 12 lakh and at the moment, our members have pooled in around Rs 3 lakh. We also plan to seek public support,"" said Mukesh Singh Adhupia, the president elect of the club. Apart from fire fighting mechanism, the two-storied tower will also have a centre where one can check blood sugar and pressure. A small library for children with story books will also be built in the tower. While the Capitol tower clock chimes to the same tune as Big Ben in London, the new clock will not ring. The old clock chimes between 6am and 9pm and stops for the night so that town is not disturbed."
58ff0ab97be9e0420db2bc19,"Kissing my turf... It's really heavy stuff, hails Richards",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160723/jsp/sports/story_98335.jsp,2016-07-23,"Virat Kohli kisses the turf after completing his double century on Friday North Sound (Antigua): ""First double hundred and in Antigua... Then, kissing my Stadium's turf... Oh, it's heavy stuff, really heavy stuff maan..."" Sir Viv Richards couldn't have been more effusive in hailing India's Test captain Virat Kohli, who sent records tumbling at the facility which bears his name. Friday, clearly, won't be forgotten by Virat. It won't be forgotten by Sir Viv either. Virat's 200 being the common thread. Making himself a cup of tea (and admiring the treatment given to his interview in our columns) in the second session, Sir Viv told The Telegraph: ""You know what, Kohli made such an emotional gesture... ""Kissing the Antigua turf, wow maan wow. And this is Kohli's maiden 200, what a feat... My congratulations to him."" When this Reporter suggested that it was Virat's way of paying tribute to everything he has meant for cricket, Sir Viv laughed as only he can. ""Then, that would mean more heavy stuff... It's big, a double hundred,"" Sir Viv said as he rushed for his next commentary stint on TV. Virat's innings of 200 (283 balls, 24x4) has set the tone for the four-Test series and the discussion across the island nations will probably dwell on just how great he'll become, say, in the next couple of years. At 27, Virat has plenty of years in front of him. That he's supremely fit is sure to extend his career even more. Virat is already being talked about in glowing terms by the locals. That was evident in the morning, on the top-rated Observer FM Station. The drive from the elitist Sugar Ridge Resort, where Virat and his men are also staying, to the Stadium, takes around half-an-hour. Could be over 35 minutes if the drivers choose to be more leisurely than usual. Overtaking, strangely is a no-no, whatever the urgency. The drive, through capital St John's, therefore, allows enough time to listen to the popular FM Station. On Friday, the cricket-specific discussion had enraged callers largely making three points. They were: (a) That Virat and the other batsmen wouldn't be ""frightened"" of the West Indies attack; [The fans' worst fears were actually confirmed in the next two-plus sessions.] (b) That the West Indies bowlers needed to quickly ""step up"" many notches; (c) The West Indies Cricket Board and the hosts, the Antigua & Barbuda Cricket Association, had done ""nothing"" to promote the ongoing first Test locally. Virat, in fact, was being spoken of in the same breath as Brian Lara. An effortless unbeaten 143 on Day I itself had obviously added to the respect Virat commands in this part of the world. Sir Viv, for one, is convinced that Virat will take batsmanship to another level. If anybody knows his cricket, it's Sir Viv. A huge compliment, then, from him. The West Indies attack is without any sting, putting more pressure on the batsmen, and the series may become terribly one-sided. There would, then, be more criticism of the Board. But how about asking Chris Gayle a question or two. In case memory needs to be refreshed, Gayle is a triple century-maker in Test cricket. What's more, Gayle has two 300-plus scores in the oldest and longest format. But, then, Gayle is more into making millions through the T20 leagues which have mushroomed across the globe. Hey, but what about priorities and loyalty to the flag? Out of fashion? Perhaps, it's time to debate."
58ff0ad57be9e0420db2bc46,Weight axe dangles on 130 cabin crew,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160622/jsp/nation/story_92627.jsp,2016-06-22,"New Delhi, June 21: For about 130 Air India flight attendants who were identified as ""overweight"" and failed to get in shape despite repeated warnings, it could be curtains now with the aviation regulator refusing to relax weight standards it had introduced two years ago. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has turned down a proposal by the government-owned airline to retain the ""overweight"" cabin crew - mostly women - saying the weight norms had been prescribed on ""technical and efficiency grounds"" and cannot be rolled back. ""The option before us now is either to ground the cabin crew members falling short of the weight standards or to ask them to opt for voluntary retirement,"" a senior official in the personnel department of Air India said. The DGCA had in May 2014 issued a circular directing all domestic airlines to classify flight attendants as ""normal"", ""overweight"" or ""obese"" - based on their BMI - and ensure that only ""fitter"" crew are assigned aircraft duties. The BMI is a measure relating a person's weight to height, calculated by dividing the mass in kg by the square of the height in metres. The circular said women would need to have BMI between 18 and 22 to be declared normal, women with BMI between 22 and 27 would be labelled overweight and those with BMI higher than 27 would be classified as obese. For men, BMI levels between 18 and 25 would be normal, 25 and 29.9 overweight, and above 30 obese. The directorate had given airlines an 18-month deadline to comply with these norms, arguing that the fitness levels of cabin crew members were directly linked to their speed and agility, and thereby to passenger safety during emergencies. After the DGCA circular arrived, medical examinations were conducted on all 3,500 cabin crew members in Air India - air hostesses and flight stewards - and 600 were found obese or overweight. They were asked to undergo clinical examinations and recommended weight reduction through a regimen of diet, exercise and lifestyle changes under periodic monitoring. ""As many as 130, however, failed to reduce weight despite several reminders and we sent a letter to DGCA in October last year asking for relaxation in norms for them since they are our senior staff and will be better able to handle international flights than the younger lot,"" another Air India official said. After launching a non-stop flight between Delhi and San Francisco in December 2015, the airline is set to begin a direct flight between Delhi and Washington soon. The national carrier, which launched a Delhi-Vienna flight in April, is also looking at taking its services to several African and Scandinavian countries. The airline currently flies to 36 destinations in the US, Europe, Australia, the Far East, Southeast Asia, and the Gulf, in addition to 48 domestic ones. ""We have decided not to go back on the BMI norms as they have been set after long deliberations over safety concerns,"" a DGCA official said. ""We are hopeful the airline can sail through the situation by giving proper training to flight attendants who are fitter."" Vishakha Verma of the All India Cabin Crew Association, however, said the insistence on the regulation was ""disheartening"". ""We are considering all options - one of them could be challenging the decision in a court of law."" One of the 130 flight attendants, a 43-year-old air hostess based in Mumbai who has been working for the airline for 22 years, said: ""I did try to reduce but could not bring down my weight significantly."" Requesting not to be named, she added: ""Linking one's efficiency merely to BMI is grossly wrong and unfair."" At 162cm, she weighed 70kg and needed to lose more than 12kg to meet the BMI target. She has been able to lose only 2kg. Medical experts say a sustained workout plan is important to lose weight and not regain it. ""Some people start exercising with much enthusiasm but do not continue it or have no control over what they eat - that could be a primary reason why they fail to reach desired weight,"" said Shalu Sehrawat, director at the Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol at a Delhi hospital. ""However, in many cases a person with BMI 27 could be fitter than a person with BMI 21. Those doing fitness training regularly, with good haemoglobin, correct blood pressure and blood sugar level and a good performance on the treadmill could be as fit as someone with lower BMI,"" she said. Calcutta-based strength and conditioning coach Ranadeep Moitra argued that ""the BMI is no longer an acceptable means of calculating how overweight one is or isn't. Experts now calculate the fat percentage of the body.... It is possible that you can have high BMI yet enjoy good metabolic health. It may also be that your BMI is low yet there is too much fat in the body""."

Over 2,600 people attended the free medical camp held at TMH and its respective clinics in Baridih, Sakchi, Sonari and Kadma, including the Tata Steel Works dispensary. As per the analysis of the week-long campaign, around 60 per cent residents of Jamshedpur have an average blood pressure reading 140/90.

For the first time in Jamshedpur, participants will be able to access the fully digitised health scorecard, the link of which will be sent to them via email and SMS. The interactive online interface will predict the risk of diabetes, hypertension, obesity and heart disease and also provide tips related to lifestyle, exercise, diet and general well-being. Tata Digital Health has also started a new digital healthcare initiative TMH Express that provides digitised healthcare service. The initiative aims to enhance the experience of doctor-patient interaction by providing facilities like paperless patient records and alerts for adverse drug interactions, thus leading to faster and accurate diagnosis."
58ff0c1c7be9e0420db2be33,How the sugar industry shifted blame to fat,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160914/jsp/foreign/story_108014.jsp,2016-09-14,"SWEET TOUCH Sept. 13: The sugar industry paid scientists in the 1960s to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and promote saturated fat as the culprit instead, newly released historical documents show. The internal sugar industry documents, recently discovered by a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, and published yesterday in JAMA Internal Medicine, suggest that five decades of research into the role of nutrition and heart disease, including many of today's dietary recommendations, may have been largely shaped by the sugar industry. ""They were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades,"" said Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at UCSF and an author of the JAMA paper. The documents show that a trade group called the Sugar Research Foundation, known today as the Sugar Association, paid three Harvard scientists the equivalent of about $50,000 in today's dollars to publish a 1967 review of research on sugar, fat and heart disease. The studies used in the review were handpicked by the sugar group, and the article, which was published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, minimised the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspersions on the role of saturated fat. Even though the influence-peddling revealed in the documents dates back nearly 50 years, more recent reports show that the food industry has continued to influence nutrition science. Last year, an article in The New York Times revealed that Coca-Cola, the world's largest producer of sugary beverages, had provided millions of dollars in funding to researchers who sought to play down the link between sugary drinks and obesity. In June, The Associated Press reported that candy makers were funding studies that claimed that children who eat candy tend to weigh less than those who do not. The Harvard scientists and the sugar executives with whom they collaborated are no longer alive. One of the scientists who was paid by the sugar industry was D. Mark Hegsted, who went on to become the head of nutrition at the US's department of agriculture, where in 1977 he helped draft the forerunner to the federal government's dietary guidelines. Another was Dr. Fredrick J. Stare, the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department.

58ff0c377be9e0420db2be5a,"Umar, Anirban in HC",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160510/jsp/nation/story_84777.jsp,2016-05-10,"New Delhi, May 9: JNU scholars Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, rusticated for taking part in a campus event to protest the February 2013 hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, today moved Delhi High Court challenging a university panel's report that led to their punishments. The court appeal came on a day the varsity's vice-chancellor, M. Jagadesh Kumar, set up another committee to negotiate with students who have been on hunger strike since the institute handed down the punishments late last month. Umar said the punishments, announced on April 25, violated the tenets of natural justice. ""Our appeal to the court is to quash this HLEC report which violates the principles of natural justice. We were in jail during the probe and had no chance to defend ourselves,"" he told this paper. The two were released on bail on March 18, over three weeks after they had surrendered to police on February 23 for investigations into allegations of sedition. The varsity's High Level Enquiry Committee (HLEC) was set up on February 11, two days after the February 9 event on the third anniversary of Guru's execution. The HLEC had submitted its report on March 11. Based on the report, 19 students and two academics from other universities were penalised, including Umar and Anirban, who have been rusticated for varying terms. This morning the two filed separate petitions asking the court to quash the report. JNU vice-chancellor Kumar - who instituted the HLEC - and chief proctor A.P. Dimri, who ordered the punishments, have been named respondents. ""The nature of the punishments is such that it affects Umar and Anirban more than most of the others,"" Umar's lawyer Rebecca John told The Telegraph. ""The HLEC did not follow due process and the punishments are completely arbitrary."" The court, she explained, would send notices to the respondents, after which a date for a hearing will be given. Anirban confirmed that he too had moved the high court but couldn't be reached later. Besides Umar and Anirban, education policy scholar Mujeeb Gattoo has also received a rustication notice. Two others have received notices expelling them from their hostels for varying terms, while 14 students, including JNU student union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar, have been fined. Two academics from other universities in the capital have been barred from the JNU campus. Vice-chancellor Kumar today set up a four-member committee to negotiate with the students, after meetings between varsity officials and office bearers of the JNU teachers' association (JNUTA), which has started a relay hunger strike to protest the VC's handling of the agitation. JNUTA and JNUSU sources said teachers have pressed for waiving the rustications and expulsions, and also asked the students to call off their indefinite fast. Umar, who too had gone on indefinite hunger strike with 19 others on April 28 - the same day chief proctor Dimri had sent the HLEC report to Delhi police's special cell - had been admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences yesterday after a drop in his blood sugar levels. He was discharged today. Ten students, including Umar, have since dropped out of the indefinite hunger strike because of ill health, while two others have joined."

(Express Photo: Subham Dutta) Farmers at a sugarcane plantation in Murshidabad. (Express Photo: Subham Dutta)What should have been a sweet season for cane growers in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh (UP) is turning out to be a bitter one, with prices of both sugar and gur falling thanks to demonetisation. It has meant reduced bargaining power for farmers, even with Indias total sugar production slated to dip from 252 lakh tonnes (lt) in 2015-16 to 225 lt this season and UP being the sole state seen to record an increase from 68.55 lt to 75 lt-plus.Since demonetisation happened on November 8, ex-factory sugar prices in UP have eased from around Rs 3,600 to Rs 3,450 per quintal. The drop has been even more for gur, where prices at Hapur have plunged from Rs 2,800 to Rs 2,400 per quintal.Watch What Else Is making NewsDemand is subdued, as there is little cash available in the market. Traders are buying sugar only for day-to-day requirements and not for stocking up. This time, we expected them to purchase more at the seasons start (mills began crushing last month), given the overall tight supply position. Instead, they are waiting and watch. Without liquidity improving, we dont see prices going up, said a UP miller.Its worse with gur, where the business is entirely cash-based. The kolhus  which typically crush 10 tonnes per day of cane, as against the 5,000-tonnes or more capacity of sugar mills  were offering farmers rates of Rs 280-300 per quintal in the period immediately preceding demonetisation. But now, they are paying Rs 220-240/quintal.Many of them have shut down because they dont have the cash to run. Although the UP government has announced a state advised price (SAP) of Rs 305/quintal for this season, mills will be under no pressure to pay because there is no competition from kolhus to purchase our cane, noted Jitender Singh Hooda, a farmer from Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district.UP mills  basically those belonging to the UK Modi group, Simbhaoli Sugars, Mawana Sugars, Rana Sugars and Bajaj Hindusthan  are still to pay Rs 1,028.75 crore out of the Rs 18,003.21 crore worth of cane that they bought from farmers in the 2015-16 season at the SAP of Rs 280 per quintal. While the Akhilesh Yadav government has increased the SAP for the current season, keeping in view Assembly elections early next year, falling sugar prices can make it difficult for mills to pay.This has come at a bad time. We were looking for a good season because low sugar output in drought-hit states like Maharashtra and Karnataka should have benefited us. But with sugar and gur prices coming down, our hopes are dashed. Even if prices increase later with cash and demand returning, it will not matter, as we would already have supplied our cane by then, added Hooda.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But harvesting the fruit on a small terrace in a grand manner is something special. The hard-work will always bear fruit. For Selvaraj Gowda it is sour and sweet as he took up the challenge and recently brought home the bacon of harvesting more than 300 kg grapes in a season on the terrace of his house at Pulliyampatti, a small village near Vedanchandhur Taluk in Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu.A tractor driver by profession, the 42-year-old god-fearing person Selvaraj hails from a poor family and his love for nature began at a tender age. His passion for growing vegetables started when he was in the fifth standard.However, the idea of growing grapes on the terrace was suggested by his wife, Soundeshwari, a couple of years back. My wife gave me a small bunch of grapes and asked me to taste it. She told me that the sweet grapes were grown in clay pots at her friend's place, Selvaraj, who also does voluntary work at temples, said.When I took interest in growing grapes in our place, we had constraints of space to make a grape garden around my house, he said. That made him almost drop the idea. However, his wife was not the one who was willing to give up easily. Soundeshwari promised full cooperation in developing a grape garden on his terrace and Selvaraj decided to take a plunge into grape cultivation and that too on his house rooftop.Initially, I spent Rs 15,000 to set up steel beams and other necessary equipment on my terrace, Selvaraj said. To mobilise additional funds for his new venture, he slogged and worked extra hours. That helped him in arranging the seed fund for the path-breaking initiative. He had about 900 sq feet available on the roof but decided to use only about 700 sq ft for the cultivation.Luckily, it clicked and he harvested good crop. As the terrace faces south, there is good sunshine throughout the day. I spent a few thousand rupees to ensure shade for roots of the plants. This was needed as continuous exposure to sunlight would have meant the plant would dry up, he said.Besides, the couple tied wire crisscross on the terrace to enable the plant to creep, spread and grow without hitches. They made grape cuttings and planted them in the tank constructed on the terrace.Selvaraj and his wife's hardwork was not in vain. The first harvest fetched him 50 kg good grapes. I and my wife were very happy when the flowers slowly turned into grapes, he said. He credited his wife for the achievement and stressed without Soundeshwari nothing could have been done.I used simple bio-fertilisers like cow dung and regular watering during summer as it is essential for healthy grape growing, he said. Natural tropical climate and regular wind and sun prevented pest attack on plants.There is a big advantage in our place, he said. We had options to regulate and make changes required for cultivation of grapes. Everything from water management to nutrient factor were under our control, he said.Selvaraj also efficiently undertook pest control measures. He says that the common pests of grape farming are flea beetles, thrips, mealy bugs and leaf hoppers. According to him, the sugar content in grapes determines when the fruit is ready to be harvested. The grapes are ready to harvest in about five to six months, he said. Selvaraj cleverly chose to grow Panneer Grapes, a popular fruit across the south India, by considering local growing conditions.Explaining about the second harvest, he said after the harvest is over, it is important to trim all green growth that you do not want to be part of the main trunk. Interestingly, the couple do not sell the grapes but give them to poor children in the area. We have decided not to sell even a single grape that is grown on our roof. Even if I grow one tonne, it will be given to children and poor people, Selvaraj asserted.Selvarajs efforts were recognised by the local farmers association, which pitched in to help him in the second harvest. After hearing about my success, local farmers helped me in giving organic fertiliser and equipment so that I could do better in the next harvest by getting 150 kg of grape, he said.My friends and neighbours came forward to help me. Some of them offered me steel poles, a few others natural fertilisers and even grape seeds, he said.Recently, Selvaraj cultivated 300 kg in his third harvest. He claims during the latest harvest, each bunch of grapes weighed about 250 grams. We are planning to achieve about 500 kg, he added.As per an expert's advice, Selvaraj allowed the grapes to grow freely in his latest cultivating season, without removing canes. He supported the vine with extra bamboo stake. Extra growth of leaves in this season will also make roots stronger and ensure that the plant gets a good start in the next season, he said.Keeping in mind the help from his friends and neighbours, Selvaraj shared the fruits. This time I had enough grapes to give to more people and children"", he said. Selvaraj adds that rooftop grape harvesting will also be a learning environment where kids from local schools, who love nature, could understand utilisation of space. Selvaraj also grows vegetables around his house. I have some space around my house to grow vegetables, he said.Selvaraj's daughter, who is in the ninth standard, helps her father.Brinjal, carrot, snake gourd, red pumpkin, cucumber, tomato and ladies finger are the latest entry to Selvaraj's garden."
58ff14737be9e0420db2c541,Stop that bill: Ex-CM,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160813/jsp/bihar/story_102140.jsp,2016-08-13,"Jagannath MishraPatna, Aug. 12: Former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra today submitted a memorandum to governor Ram Nath Kovind, requesting him to invoke Article 200 of the Constitution and not give assent to the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Bill, 2016, on the ground that it was cruel, curtailed personal liberty, and promoted hatred towards law and extortion by enforcement officials. The request comes close on the heels of RJD vice-president and former Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh sharply criticising chief minister Nitish Kumar over his efforts to implement, what according to him were, draconian provisions to enforce prohibition in the state, and requesting the governor not to give his assent to the bill, which is awaiting his signature. In his memorandum, Jagannath drew the governors attention to possible ill effects of the new bill. He said the new provisions violate the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and criminal jurisprudence by bringing in a new theory by which people would be punished for crimes committed by others, thereby making criminals out of innocent families, communities and companies. Jagannath said: You (governor) will agree that whenever personal liberty is curtailed, it leads to an increase in incidents of suppression and injustice. You are well versed with the Constitution, hence I request you to withhold assent to the bill under Article 200 of the Constitution in the interest of public interest or reserve it for Presidential assent. The former chief minister also pointed out that Article 201 of the Constitution provides that in such a situation the President will whether assent should or should not be given to such a bill. Jagannath elaborated how under the proposed new law, all adult members of a family could be sent to jail if any one family member flouts prohibition, landlords could be punished if any tenant violates the liquor ban or enforcement agencies so much as find grapes, jaggery or sugar in a house. Besides, he pointed out, the district magistrate has been given powers used during British rule to punish entire villages in case of prohibition rule violations. The former chief minister said that the Bihar government was indulging in such measures to make people forget development promises it had made. He also expressed concern that the BJP-led central government could be desiring the passage of such a harsh law so that the Nitish-led government in Bihar spends its remaining four years in its implementation at the cost of other welfare works.The JDU has issued a whip to all its MLAs directing them to vote in favour of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, despite strong reservation expressed by several of its legislators. But after fines slapped on entire hamlets in Nalanda and Bhagalpur for repeated violation of the prohibition, deep resentments have surfaced in the party. Had the parties ( JDU and RJD) not issued whips, the bill would have been defeated in both Houses, Raghuvansh had said on Thursday."

It had been part of my life for the last 46 years. I felt almost the same emotion of losing a friend.I came to Bangalore as a bachelor, in 1969 to take up a job. I was fortunate to get a spacious room with an attached bathroom in a good lodge. Food was not an issue as there was a hotel right below our rooms. The only problem I faced was getting my bed coffee. I hated the idea of getting dressed and going out to drink my morning coffee.My roommate had an electric stove, and Nescafe, sugar and milk were easy to get. So I went in search of a saucepan to boil the milk. I got one easily for Rs 30 from a stainless steel utensils shop nearby. We proudly inaugurated our morning coffee project the next day along with a few friends. That started my long association with my saucepan.When I got married and moved into a house, most of my bachelor items were discarded, but not my saucepan. It occupied a prime place in our various kitchens, as we moved from one house to another. In the last 15 years, I have used it practically every morning to prepare my oats porridge.Two weeks ago, its handle broke suddenly. Although it was still very much useable, my wife suggested that we retire our good old saucepan. I had no option but to agree, though I felt very sad. It had been our constant companion over so many years of happy and difficult days. I must say that I had similar emotions while letting go of my first rented house, my first scooter, my first helmet and my first car, but my saucepan seemed to evoke even stronger feelings.The emotional attachment to inanimate objects seems to be somewhat hereditary. My son and his family live in London. Mostly, he visits us during Chr-istmas holidays every year. He has a cupboard in our Bengaluru home in which he has carefully preserved some of his marble collection and an old brick from the St Josephs High School building, when it was remodeled some years ago.On each of his visits, he will always open the cupboard and lovingly examine all his artifacts. During his college days, once my wife wanted to give away his collection of marbles, but he threw a big fit. She finds her husband and son a little weird, but I understand that we are not alone in having an attachment to inanimate objects.The Japanese observe Hari-Kuyo, also known as the Festival of Broken Needles, where participants hold a memorial ser-vice for worn-out needles and lay them to rest in gratitude for their years of service. I may not hold a memorial service for my saucepan, but would definitely like to say a big thank you and goodbye."

The Surrey star hit a solid 65 as England drew first blood in the five-match series, recovering his poise after seeking medical attention when feeling light-headed. The 26-year-old was relieved to have avoided any serious problem, saying: ""I had to brave dizziness. It was a case of low sugar levels apparently. That's it... Plain and simple. ""I had a headache, felt a bit dizzy... They got the physio and the doctor on, and told me to get some sugar on board. I'll just remember in future on a hot day to be mindful of that. ""Nevertheless, I was able to get my bearings, settle and reset myself and just go again."" England eventually won by 44 runs on the D/L method after two late rain delays interrupted their reply to Pakistan's total of 260 fos six. When the rain forced an early abandonment, England were well ahead at 194 for three after Joe Root's 61 and an unbeaten 33 from Eoin Morgan. On his part, captain Morgan wants the one-day team to keep pushing themselves to new heights and believes there is a high amount of confidence in the squad. ""The key phrase is pushing the side. Over the last 12-18 months, we've seen the progression of everyone and the skill levels,"" Morgan was quoted as saying by a cricket-specific website. ""There's a huge amount of belief. We believe in ourselves. It's almost as though there are no restrictions to anything we can do."" However, Morgan wants more consistency from the side, as the series win against New Zealand, Pakistan (in Dubai) and Sri Lanka have been tempered by losses to Australia and South Africa since the last World Cup, and a climb from their current position of No. 5 in the rankings. Within the next year, the period which includes the Champions Trophy, Morgan wants England within the top three. ""Realistically, if we want to be favourites going into the Champions Trophy or the World Cup, then we need to work our way up the rankings which means showing more consistency in all three facets."
58ff16517be9e041361624e4,Should we be  scared of butter?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/579038/should-we-scared-butter.html,2016-11-02,"Should we be scared of butter?Jane E Brody, Nov 03, 2016, International New York Times 22:37 ISTUnless you have a medical condition that dictates otherwise, there's no reason to cut butter or ice creamIs butter, along with other sources of saturated fats, back on the table, as many have recently claimed? It is. Just not in the quantities the meat, dairy and fast-food industries might have you ingest.Unless you have a medical condition that dictates otherwise, theres no reason to cut anything  not butter, ice cream or Porterhouse steak  completely from your diet as long as you mainly eat plant-based food (vegetables, fruits and whole grains), lean animal protein and fish and dont go overboard on foods rich in saturated fats that can cause harm in excess.Thats the conclusion of the best available evidence Ive reviewed for maximising the health of body and brain and enjoying a long life. The unending controversies about a wholesome diet provide much fodder for this column.An extensively researched book by science writer Nina Teicholz (The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet), published in 2014, has raised serious questions about the evidence that nearly 40 years ago prompted the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs to recommend that Americans follow a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol to curb what was then a runaway epidemic of heart and other cardiovascular diseases.Those recommendations spawned an outpouring of low-fat and fat-free processed foods that replaced the maligned fats with carbohydrates, primarily sugars and refined starches, which the body treats like sugar.A result: Heart attacks and coronary deaths are way down (thanks largely to the decline in smoking and use of cholesterol-lowering medications along with dietary changes), but obesity and Type 2 diabetes have soared. So what should we do? Cut back on carbs and go back to eating lots of high-fat meats and dairy products? Not if you value your health. The task now is to appreciate the effects that different nutrients have on the body and adopt a rational and enjoyable diet that takes both health benefits and risks into account.Upon reviewing the newest reports, Dr Boris Hansel, a French endocrinologist-nutritionist who specialises in obesity management, wrote in a Medscape commentary: Butter is one of the foods with the highest saturated fat content, and consuming it on a regular basis promotes an increase in blood cholesterol levels.But, he added, It should be considered a pleasure food for those who are fond of it, provided it is consumed in moderate amounts and not consumed in addition to other foods that are high in saturated fatty acids.At the same time, a lot more attention should be paid to the overconsumption of simple and refined carbohydrates  the sugary drinks, desserts, pastries and snacks, as well as white bread, white rice and potatoes  that promote obesity and now threaten to reverse the decades-long decline in cardiovascular disease.Not all fats and not all carbohydrates are created equal, Dr Frank Hu, the senior author of a recent report on saturated fats, told me. The types of fats and carbohydrates are more important than the quantity.Hu is a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and a member of the nations Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee that last year recommended a diet lower in red and processed meat, which have been linked to heart disease and cancer.Saturated fat is still bad for heart disease risk, Hu told the Nutrition Action Healthletter, published by the Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a public advocacy group.Evidence from studies on thousands of people shows that if you replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, you reduce your risk of heart disease. If you replace saturated fat with refined carbs, you dont reduce your risk. Studies that seem to exonerate saturated fats often fail to compare their effects with the appropriate nutrients, Hu said in an interview.Furthermore, he claims that, heart risk aside, diets low in saturated fats do not prevent premature death have now been refuted by a huge observational study published online in July in JAMA Internal Medicine.With Dr Dong D Wang in Hus department as first author, this study of 83,349 female nurses followed for 32 years and 42,884 male health professionals followed for 26 years found that both total death rates and deaths from specific diseases like heart disease, respiratory disease, cancer and dementia were reduced among those consuming the least amount of saturated and trans fats, replacing them with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.Simply substituting 5% of calories from saturated fats with the equivalent amount of polyunsaturated fats reduced total deaths by 27%, and replacing saturates with monounsaturates (from foods like olive and canola oil, nuts and avocados) reduced deaths by 13%. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish also modestly lowered total mortality, the researchers found.Saturated fatsHowever, when saturated fats were consumed in place of carbohydrates, there was no significant drop in cardiovascular death rates and slightly higher death rates from cancer.Wang and colleagues wrote that this finding was not surprising because the major sources of carbohydrates in a typical Western diet are highly processed foods with large amounts of refined starch and sugar that can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of saturated fats.For the various diseases with death rates linked to diets high in saturated fats, chronic inflammation is believed to be a main underlying cause. Chronic low-grade inflammation promotes atherosclerosis, leading to cholesterol-clogged arteries and setting the stage for heart attacks and strokes. The same process affects arteries in the brain and can result in vascular dementia, a common cause of memory loss.On the other hand, a Mediterranean-style diet rich in olive oil and nuts but relatively low in saturated fats not only protects the heart but also has been shown to improve cognitive function and may reduce the risk of Alzheimers disease, according to a report from Barcelona last year.Diets rich in red meat and processed meats have repeatedly been linked to an increased risk of developing colon cancer. And an ongoing study of young nurses under the auspices of the Harvard School of Public Health is exploring evidence that higher intakes of saturated fats (as well as too many simple carbohydrates) can raise the risk of premenopausal breast cancer.All saturated fats are not alike, which is good news for chocolate lovers. Stearic acid, the saturated fat in dark chocolate, does not raise unhealthy cholesterol. And theres room for an occasional indulgence  if you eat healthfully most of the time."

My autograph book was merely 5x3 inches.I recently came across my old autograph album. There is gladness in remembrance, I read on the first faded page. That lovely line, which I had borrowed from a long-forgotten source, was my invitation to family and friends to share their thoughts in writing.My brother responded by drawing two children and adding the caption, This girl and boy are Surya and Suresh. Our Hindi masters comment was even more concise and took the form of a compliment: Surya is a good girl, he declared. Mr Sharma probably meant it!At least, unlike my kid brother, I had not run away from home. One evening, just before tuition, Suresh had tried to flee to our IAF father who was posted in Dinjan, Assam. The little fellow had not left our backyard, let alone New Delhi, when he was intercepted by the tutor he had hoped to escape.Five years my junior, Suresh was six years old when I started collecting autographs. Even if he had been aware of their significance, he was too young to express himself eloquently. For that matter, even my fellow students, who were orally articulate, were far from communicative on paper. This was not because they agreed with Polonius that brevity is the soul of wit. Indeed, we hardly knew that Shakespearean character then!Messages were short, not because of nicety but necessity. My autograph book measured merely 5x3 inches. I acquired a larger one for celebrities on September 9, 1967, after mental calculator, Shakuntala Devi, struggled to squeeze in her sprawling signature.Life is love and love is life, wrote Neerja. Those words took on magical meaning in the early 1970s, when Rajesh Khanna was the love of my life! Another classmate also affirmed affection in a quatrain that she claimed to have composed. After stating that bees were drawn to honey, flowers to dew and kings to money, Nilima categorically concluded, And I like you. This pleasing pronouncement was somewhat diluted by her signing off with the ungrammatical oxymoron, Your enemiest pal.Since talented Nilima was admired, everyone imitated her by penning verse. Unfortunately, most of their efforts lacked originality and tended to be repetitive. I was flooded with, Roses are red and violets are blue, which ended either in, Sugar is sweet and so are you, or the less flattering, Monkeys like you should be put in the zoo. Then, there was the illogical, Drink hot coffee, drink hot tea, Burn your lips and remember me.Among these commonplace contributions shines quiet Manjulas gem: If your lips would keep from slips/ Five things observe with care;/ To whom you speak, of whom you speak/ And how, and when, and where. Not original, perhaps, but those wise words are as relevant today as they were five decades ago!"

Over the past three months, the cops have seized brown sugar worth Rs 30 lakh and arrested a dozen drug peddlers from various parts of Bhubaneswar. The police started a crackdown on peddlers of ganja and brown sugar following the death of an engineering student on May 6. Engineering student Ashutosh Mahanty, 21, allegedly died after being drugged by a peddler from the Haldi Padia slum. This slum, which is located near Laxmisagar police station, has been a major market for sale of the contraband with the police busting three brown sugar peddling rackets there in the past three years. The cops said the contraband was mostly smuggled into Odisha from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bengal and is sold in Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Rourkela, Puri and Balasore. ""Since a very small quantity of brown sugar is sold between Rs 150 and Rs 200, the peddlers find the job very lucrative. On August 10, we arrested a peddler called Ayesha Biwi from Haldi Padia slum and this wasn't the first time she was arrested on this charge,"" said a police official. Excise officials suspect the illegal trade has spread to several other slums in the city. ""We have information of the drug being sold at Chakeisiani in Mancheswar, Old Town, Dumuduma, Mali Sahi and Salia Sahi. But the operation is being conducted so clandestinely, that we are yet to track down the peddlers despite several raids,"" said an excise official. The police said the drug peddlers were now providing the contraband to customers through orders on mobile phones. ""Earlier, the customers used to come to the peddlers. But after we started raiding the hideouts, they are conducting business through mobile phones. We recently arrested a peddler called Dillip Singh who admitted to delivering the contraband directly to his customers,"" said a police official.

58ff1e197be9e0420db2ce76,Digvijaya guns for Gadkari scalp,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160813/jsp/nation/story_102273.jsp,2016-08-13,"New Delhi, Aug. 12: Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh today wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking transport minister Nitin Gadkaris removal for allegedly misusing his official position to bolster his personal businesses. The Congress leader, who later released the letter to the media, accused Gadkari of having influenced a government decision to blend ethanol in petroleum products and overturning a ban on e-rickshaws, both to benefit companies linked to him or his family. The letter recalled that the Prime Minister had earlier cancelled a Rs 10,000-crore contract given illegally to one such firm for the construction of Zojila Pass tunnel in Kashmir. The letter said: Therefore, you must take cognisance of this and take action against him. I know you will not act because of political compulsions but still it is my duty to remind you, as the self-proclaimed chowkidar in the national interest as Prime Minister of India, you should. Digvijaya wrote that although Gadkari was not in charge of the ministry which deals with blending of ethanol in petroleum, he had issued a statement about a cabinet note on increasing the percentage of ethanol from 10% to 22.5%. A cabinet note is a secret document. As minister, he also violated the oath of secrecy. The letter said Gadkaris son Nikhil is listed as a director of Purti Power & Sugar Ltd. Sensing the decision, Purti decided to treble its production from 45 kilo litres per day to 135 kilo litres per day. In another decision, Gadkari, as minister of transport, started ethanol-run public transport buses. He earlier overturned the ban on electronic rickshaws in the national capital. He also announced the Deen Dayal Scheme under which potential e-rickshaw buyers would get a loan on 3% interest rate. Digvijaya claimed Gadkari's brother-in-law Rajesh Totade was a director in Purti Green Technologies, which manufactures e-rickshaws. The other director of Purti, Prasad Prabhakaranrao Kashikar, is also listed as a director in Chaitanya Constructions & Builders. One of the directors of Chaitanya Constructions is Gadkari's (other) son Sarang. Therefore, there are clear links between Gadkari family and Purti Green Technologies. Digvijaya and Gadkari have long been locked in feuds. In October 2012, Gadkari had filed a defamation suit against Digvijaya for accusing him of having business links with a BJP MP, Ajay Sancheti, who had allegedly pocketed Rs 500 crore in a coal block allocation. Digvijaya refused to apologise and is fighting the case. Soon after getting bail in the case, Digvijaya had threatened to fully expose Gadkari and prove all charges against the man who was more a businessman than a politician. The Congress had also raised the charges against Gadkari. It paralysed Parliament for several days. The deadlock broke when Gadkari offered an explanation in the Rajya Sabha but the Congress had rejected his clarification and said the issues were still unresolved."

Telegraph picture Jamshedpur, Aug. 20: Sportspersons are known to follow a strict diet during rigorous training sessions, but a bit of cheating is pardonable. Not for Pusarla Venkata Sindhu though. Biryani went completely off the star shuttler's plate during the Olympics-specific preparatory camp at Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad. Chocolates and ice cream were also a strict no-no for Sindhu, who yesterday won India its first silver in a woman's individual event at the Olympics after losing to world No. 1 Carolina Marin of Spain. ""She (Sindhu) did not have the liberty to eat biryani as chief coach Gopichand was totally against spicy food. The mentors and shuttlers went out for occasional parties at Hyderabad restaurants, but Gopichand always kept a hawk's eye on Sindhu's plate,"" recalled Chaibasa-based Sachin Kumar Rana, one of the coaches at the camp organised by the Badminton Association of India (BAI). Rana, who is in Jamshedpur, is employed with the South Eastern Railway in Kharagpur. A bit disappointed over Sindhu's loss, he said that the ace shuttler had once taken a bit of biryani during a party but Gopichand was quick to spot it and asked her not to eat it. Sugar is also strictly banned at the badminton cradle. ""Sindhu used to take breakfast (bread, upma, egg, juice etc) at the academy, but preferred having lunch and dinner at her home, which is around 5km from the venue,"" Rana said, adding that her father P.V. Ramana also used to attend the camp. He took eight months' leave to be with his daughter. ""It's an example for parents to follow. Her mother also used to drop in sometimes. A former volleyball player, Ramana was a relieved man when the World Badminton Federation sent the Olympic qualification list to the BAI on May 5,"" the mentor added. Sindhu used to arrive at the academy at 4.15am and leave for home at 5pm. ""She was very focused on her game and also did a lot of running and gyming. She gave her cent per cent during the training sessions. Sindhu is a shy girl, who has now become bold,"" Rana said. K. Prabhakar Rao, secretary of Jharkhand Badminton Association (JBA), also shared his memories of India's Olympic shero. ""Sindhu used to crave for chocolates during the Malaysian Grand Prix in 2014. She stayed with her mother P.V. Vijaya at the hotel. But Vijaya never allowed her,"" said Jamshedpur-based Rao, the manager of the Indian team for the Malaysia trip."

Picture by Ranjeet Kumar Dey Patna, Sept. 9: Vice-President Hamid Ansari today reminded chief minister Nitish Kumar of Bihar's failings, after praising its GDP growth over the past decade. Ansari said the state needs expanding economic growth for at least two decades to join the league of developed states. ""Impressive as these gains (economy and per capita income growth) are, they have to be seen in the context of small economic base. States like Haryana and Goa have outperformed Bihar, which still has one of the lowest per capita income levels in the country,"" Ansari said. ""Bihar lags behind Madhya Pradesh by 10 years and India by 15 years. The Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation data shows the state's economy was the 14th largest in the country in 2014-15, up one spot from 15th in 2004-05."" The Vice-President was speaking after inaugurating the 90th anniversary celebrations of the Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries at its headquarters in Patna before Governor Ram Nath Kovind, chief minister Nitish Kumar, deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav, chamber's president O.P. Sah and others. Ansari's comments came after he pointed out that the 10th Bihar Economic Survey Report-2015-16 - tabled by the state government in February - said the economy grew annually at 10.5 per cent from 2005-06 to 2014-15, the highest among major states in the country. Sectors like manufacturing, construction, insurance and banking in Bihar grew at over 15 per cent during the decade and per capita income from Rs 7,914 to Rs 15,640 - the state's overall contribution to the country's economy rising from 2.6 to 3.3 per cent. The Bihar economic survey report calculated per capita income at constant prices with 2004-05 as base year. But the central government data reveals that Bihar was at rock bottom when it came to per capita income in 2014-15 - be it on constant or current prices. Delhi topped the charts in 2014-15 with a per capita annual income of Rs 2.41 lakh at current prices and Rs 1.18 lakh at 2004-05 constant prices. Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Telangana and Punjab had a per capita income three to five times more than Bihar's. Ansari's remarks heralded pin-drop silence. He proceeded to say the state must ""expand its economic growth and maintain its tempo for at least two decades if it aspired to join the league of developed states"". ""Bihar has tremendous potential in the agriculture sector, given its natural advantage such as fertile soil, access to river water for irrigation and warm climate,"" Ansari said. ""I'm informed the government is pursuing a 'rainbow revolution' akin to the Green Revolution, that can change the face of agriculture if implemented well."" He said Bihar must reap the demographic dividend with greater focus on education and skill development. He also emphasised that business could be conducted best under conditions of peace, stability and good governance, of which ""rule of law"" was an essential ingredient. Though Ansari went on to elaborate national and international nuances of the ""rule of law"", it left the audience wondering if his comments were a reference to the recent prohibition Act and charges about rising crime and lawlessness. Ansari honoured five industrialists with Bihar connection, namely Vedanta Resources chairman Anil Agarwal, Alkem Laboratories founder Samprada Singh, Bennett, Coleman and Company Limited managing director Vineet Jain, KK Birla Group of Sugar Companies chairman and managing director C.S. Nopany, and ITC chairman YC Deveshwar. Vineet, Samprada and Deveshwar were not present in person."

His company will also explore the possibility of setting up processing units for aluminium, oil and gas, zinc and silver here. ""My wish is to establish a truly global university at a cost of Rs 25,000 crore. I will invest Rs 10,000 crore in it. We are already working for a full-fledged Vedanta University in Odisha and people in Bihar have similar expectations. We could consider setting it up here,"" Anil said. Agarwal was ""born and brought up in Patna"" and now resides in London. He has a net worth of around $2 billion or over Rs 13,000 crore. He was in Patna to attend the 90th anniversary of Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries. He was one of five famous entrepreneurs from Bihar, including Alkem Laboratories founder Samprada Singh, Bennett, Coleman and Company Limited managing director Vineet Jain, KK Birla Group of Sugar Companies chairman and managing director C.S. Nopany, and ITC chairman YC Deveshwar to be felicitated at the event. Agarwal, who is into aluminum and energy business, said his company ""will explore possibilities of setting up aluminum, oil and gas, zinc, lead, copper and silver processing units in Bihar, as the state is close to my heart."" He added that he wanted to use 75 per cent of his wealth for social service. The Vedanta Resources chairman said Bihar has become an ideal place for industrial investment with cheap land and labour, lack of labour unions, easy availability of water and electricity and a better law and order situation. ""Granting special category status to the state would have helped attract industries to Bihar. However, the status' importance will decline with GST coming in force in the country,"" he said. Expressing concern about large-scale malnutrition in the country, he said he was taking forward Prime Minister Narendra Modi's thoughts and had decided to establish 4,000 Nand Ghars, of which 500 would be in Bihar. ""These Nand Ghars would be centres where emphasis will be given on health, nutrition, medical needs and education of children and economic empowerment of women through various skills. They are expected to benefit 2.5 crore children and 1.2 crore women,"" Anil said. He said he also wanted to help develop medical facilities in his home state, and added that Bihar government should try to persuade companies like those of Baba Ramdev's Patanjali group, which is setting up huge food processing industries in Maharashtra and other states, to establish them here."

They pledged to pursue new opportunities to bolster economic growth and sustainable development, promote peace and security at home and around the world, strengthen inclusive, democratic governance and respect for universal human rights, and provide global leadership on issues of shared interest.2) The leaders welcomed the significant progress made in bilateral relations between India and the United States during their tenure, in accordance with the roadmaps set out in the Joint Statements issued during Prime Minister Modis visit to the United States in September 2014 and President Obamas visit to India in January 2015. The leaders affirmed the increasing convergence in their strategic perspectives and emphasized the need to remain closely invested in each others security and prosperity.Advancing U.S.-India Global Leadership on Climate and Clean Energy3) The steps that the two Governments have taken in the last two years through the U.S.-India Contact Group, including by addressing the nuclear liability issue, inter alia, through Indias ratification of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, have laid a strong foundation for a long-term partnership between U.S. and Indian companies for building nuclear power plants in India. Culminating a decade of partnership on civil nuclear issues, the leaders welcomed the start of preparatory work on site in India for six AP 1000 reactors to be built by Westinghouse and noted the intention of India and the U.S. Export-Import Bank to work together toward a competitive financing package for the project. Once completed, the project would be among the largest of its kind, fulfilling the promise of the U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement and demonstrating a shared commitment to meet Indias growing energy needs while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Both sides welcomed the announcement by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd, and Westinghouse that engineering and site design work will begin immediately and the two sides will work toward finalizing the contractual arrangements by June 2017.4) The United States and India share common climate and clean energy interests and are close partners in the fight against climate change.

58ff24567be9e0420db2d70b,BJP to woo UP as Santa Claus,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160914/jsp/nation/story_108113.jsp,2016-09-14,"New Delhi, Sept. 13: The BJP is set to trumpet the Centre's handouts to Uttar Pradesh in the run-up to the Assembly polls but party sources said the projection would be less brassy than in Bihar. In Bihar the BJP was convinced that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Rs 1.25-lakh package, announced on August 18 last year in Arrah, would be the defining moment. But not only did his opponents dub the ""gift"" a ""charity auction"" after Modi unwrapped the amount in tranches, the results made it clear it had no impact on voters. ""This time, we will nuance the Centre's contributions and link them to a macro picture of the economy,"" a Union minister said, citing the revival of a urea plant in Gorakhpur as an example. Defunct since 1990, the resurrection of the unit owned by Fertiliser Corporation could be the centrepiece of an ""alternative narrative"" being crafted by Modi and the BJP to try and mitigate the adverse fallout of the Dalit unrest against the party. ""Once the work is completed, the factory is expected to produce 13 lakh tonnes of urea annually and reduce the problem of fertiliser shortage in Uttar Pradesh besides opening up job opportunities and scaling down migration from the eastern districts,"" a BJP office-bearer from the state said. The other big element in the Centre's portrayal of itself as Santa Claus to Uttar Pradesh is the ""bounty"" purportedly showered on sugarcane growers of the western region. According to the Union minister involved in fine-tuning the sugar package, first the sugar mill owners, notorious for defaulting on payments for years on end, were compelled to give the names of the farmers owed dues. ""They could not have fudged their registers beyond a point,"" the minister said. Once it got the names, the Centre got the bank account details of the farmers and transferred the amounts it had decided to underwrite directly to them instead of routing through the mills. The minister said sugarcane farmers were being given incentives to use part of their produce to make white sugar and divert portions to manufacturing ethanol and raw sugar. Among the schemes announced by Modi since 2014, the BJP will highlight Mudra (Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency) because it believes that a chunk of Uttar Pradesh's unorganised sector, which includes people from the Other Backward Classes and Dalits, has been a big beneficiary. Close to 44 lakh people have enrolled under the scheme and over Rs 15,000 crore has gone to Uttar Pradesh so far. Asked why the BJP thought the Centre's ""munificence"" would click with the Uttar Pradesh electorate when it did not with Bihar's, a party source argued: ""Bihar had made up its mind before the polls to have a certain leadership. But Bihar is a salutary reminder to the voters of Uttar Pradesh not to fall for that kind of leadership because of the problems it has brought from the crackdown after prohibition, jungle rule and Lalu Prasad's remote control."""

Site of blast at Chennai Central in 2014.DESPITE TWO arrested SIMI operatives having reportedly admitted that they carried out twin bomb blasts on the Bangalore-Guwahati Kaziranga Express on May 1, 2014, which killed a young TCS software engineer, the Chennai Crime Branch-CID that is probing the case is yet to obtain custody of the two accused men on account of an ordinance preventing their transfer from MP.We tried to obtain their custody a while ago. They have promulgated an ordinance that does not allow prisoners to be moved out of MP, said Karan Singha, ADGP of TN CB-CID.A similar ordinance had been promulgated by the NIA against moving Yasin Bhatkal from the high-security prison in Hyderabad following his arrest in 2013. The move is seen as a security measure to prevent escapes or attacks involving dangerous prisoners.Indeed, the SIMI operatives from MP had escaped from a Khandwa prison in October 2013. Their role in the Chennai train blasts was suspected ever since a phone number linked to them was found to have been used at a station on the Bangalore Chennai line before the blast. Their actual involvement, investigators said, emerged following their arrests in Rourkela in Odisha on February 17 this year.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn statements given to investigators from multiple states where they had travelled in a three-year run as fugitives after escaping from Khandwa in 2013, two SIMI men  out of four arrested  have reportedly narrated how they carried out the Chennai train blast of May 1, 2014.The four arrested in Rourkela were Shaikh Mehboob alias Guddu, 32, Zakir Hussain alias Sadiq, 33, Amjad Khan alias Pappu 28, and Mohammed Salik alias Sallu, 37. Zakir was allegedly one of the planters of the two bombs on the train while Mehboob was involved in its creation at a hideout in Dharwad in north Karnataka in April 2014. The others were reportedly in UP at the time.A second suspected planter of a bomb on the Kaziranga Express, Mohammed Aijazuddin, was killed in an encounter with Telangana police in an exchange during which he and an associate shot dead three policemen.According to accounts attributed to Zakir, the motive behind the planting of bombs on the Kaziranga Express was to retaliate for alleged attacks on Muslims in Assam. We decided to cause blasts targeting Assamese, he is said to have told investigators.The plan was for the bomb to explode after the Kaziranga Express left the Chennai Central Station to create an impression that it had been planted in Chennai. However, with the train running late and the SIMI men having set the device to go off after around five hours, the IED exploded shortly after the train arrived in Chennai around 7.30 am on May 1.Before carrying out the actual attack, Zakir claims to carried out a dry run by travelling on the train from Bengaluru to Chennai after arriving from his Dharwad hideout. He travelled to Chennai on the train and later returned by bus.The two IEDs used in the blast, according to the statements, were created in the Dharwad hideout that Zakir, Mehboob and Aijaz had taken in the guise of being cloth merchants Anand Joshi, Kishan and Arvind from UP. They reportedly mixed powder from matchsticks with firecracker powder and sugar and poured it into elbow pipes.Aijaz and Zakir reached Bengaluru from Dharwad on the night of April 31 and boarded the Kaziranga Express with general-compartment tickets bought at the Bangalore Cantonment station. About an hour into their journey, they reportedly took their bags containing the IEDs to the bathroom and connected the batteries of the timer devices, setting in motion the trigger for the device.Around 3.30 am, they planted the IEDs beneath seats in two sleeper compartments while all the passengers were asleep, according to Zakirs statements. He and Aijaz stayed on the train for another hour before disembarking at a railway station. They then returned to Bangalore on a train travelling in the opposite direction and heard about the blasts on reaching their hideouts in Dharwad.Swathi Prachuri, 22, a software engineer travelling home to Andhra Pradesh on her first visit since getting a job, was killed in the blast at Chennai Central.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It uses a Rs 10 strip and can also test lipids, triglycerides, creatinine and haemoglobin.Scientists are now eyeing the global market. The biggest bottleneck, however, is an inverted duty structure, because of which import makes more economical sense than local manufacturing. An inverted duty structure impacts domestic industry adversely as manufacturers have to pay a higher price for raw material in terms of duty, while imported finished products land at lower duty and cost lesser.We have requested the Finance Ministry to change the tax structure, Renu Swarup, who heads the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council told Deccan Herald.A faecal incontinence device meant for stool collection at intensive care units and hospital wards without violating patients dignity has received approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration.Researchers at IIT-Madras have developed a mobile surgical unit and an eye screening device for use in rural India."

(Source: Reuters/File) The latest data shows that mills have made payments of only Rs 12,201.73 crore. (Source: Reuters/File)At a show of strength in Saharanpur Thursday to mark two years of his government  and also virtually launch the BJPs campaign for next years Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections  Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the dues to sugarcane growers had reduced, under his governments watch, from Rs 14,000 crore to hardly Rs 700-800 crore.When I took charge (as PM), cane farmers were owed Rs 14,000 crore. We made efforts to ensure they got paid in time. I can say that these dues have to a great extent been cleared, through different schemes of ours. About Rs 700-800 crore of payments are still pending. I am requesting the state government and warning the sugar mills that whatever you have done to farmers for all these years, now you will not be allowed to do, he said at the Vikas Parva rally.Data from the Cane Commissioners Office in Lucknow, however, tells a very different story.Records as of May 26  the day Modi made his speech  show that cane dues of UP mills come to Rs 5,795 crore, which is almost eight times the Rs 700-800 crore amount mentioned by Modi.Records show that during the current 2015-16 sugar season since October, for which crushing is virtually complete, mills in UP have bought cane worth Rs 17,996.73 crore from farmers at the state governments advised price (SAP) of Rs 280 per quintal.Given the low realisations of Rs 2,600-2,700 per quintal for sugar at the start of the season, the Samajwadi Party administration had allowed mills to pay the SAP in two instalments. The first Rs 230/quintal installment was to be paid within 14 days of the cane being delivered to the factory, with the balance Rs 50 payable within three months after completion of crushing operations.The latest data shows that mills have made payments of only Rs 12,201.73 crore. This is below even the Rs 14,815.89 crore that farmers should have got at Rs 230/quintal rate within 14 days of supply.The big defaulters, accounting for the bulk of the Rs 2,614.16 crore first-installment arrears, include Bajaj Hindusthan (Rs 883.48 crore), Mawana Sugars (Rs 409.58 crore), U.K. Modi Group (Rs 319.20 crore), Simbhaoli Sugars (Rs 288.82 crore), Rana Group (Rs 212.50 crore), Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises (Rs 116.72 crore) and Uttam Sugar (Rs 101.55 crore).On the other hand, the likes of Balrampur Chini, Triveni Engineering, Dhampur Sugar, K.K. Birla Group, DCM Shriram, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Wave have made the Rs 230/quintal first-installment payments. They still need to pay the remaining Rs 50/quintal, though.So, the cane dues of UP mills against the full SAP of Rs 280 per quintal comes to Rs 5,795 crore, not the Rs 700-800 crore amount mentioned by Modi.The ex-factory realisations of Rs 3,400-3,450 per quintal for sugar will just about allow us to pay the Rs 280/quintal cane SAP. But then, our average realisation for the season (from October) is only around Rs 2,900 per quintal, said a miller, who has made the Rs 230/quintal first-installment payment.Many mills, he added, were keen to pay even the balance Rs 50/quintal: We need some support from the state government from that. They should at least make the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) pay us for the co-generation power that we have supplied.The industry estimates the dues owed by UPPCL against supplies by mills at an average rate of Rs 4.96 per unit at roughly Rs 1,000 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: May 28, 2016 5:10 am"

Sadhu over alleged anomalies in the distribution of rice and sugar under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The BJP members told Sadhu that several villages had raised apprehensions over rice and sugar meant for them being siphoning off. ""The matter is very serious as it concerns the poor for whom the rice is essential. In the absence of a fair price dealer, the vigilance committee had taken up the onus of distributing the PDS material to the beneficiaries. However they seem more intent on depriving the beneficiaries than actually helping,"" said Bachu Marak, president of the BJP unit. The villagers alleged that three kg of rice were given to each individual instead of five kg as alloted under the act. A family with six members, entitled to get 30kg of rice, is given 18kg per month, the BJP delegates told Sadhu. The deputy commissioner assured them that strict action would be taken against those found guilty. ""We will inquire into the matter and take necessary action against the people who are responsible,"" he said. The BJP members also sought inclusion of genuine beneficiaries who have been denied NFSA cards. ""Many genuine beneficiaries have been deprived of the scheme while government employees, big businessmen and well-to-do people have been made beneficiaries. This is absolutely wrong and we urge those who are not eligible to surrender their cards so that people with genuine problems can benefit,"" the BJP president said. The BJP functionaries said they would file an RTI on the beneficiaries so that those not entitled are struck off the list."

58ff2f477be9e0420db2e1b8,Move to raise LNG import,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161014/jsp/business/story_113334.jsp,2016-10-14,"New Delhi, Oct. 13: India plans to more than double its LNG import capacity to 50 million tonnes (mt) in the next few years as part of a strategy to move towards a gas-based economy, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said today. ""We have an LNG import and regassification capacity of 21mt, which we plan to raise to 50mt in a few years,"" he said. The country wants to raise the share of natural gas in its energy mix to 15 per cent in the next 3-4 years from 6.5 per cent, Pradhan said during the signing of an MoU between The Energy and Resources Institute and PetroFed. Globally, natural gas makes up for 24 per cent of the energy basket. Petronet LNG operates a 10 mt-a-year LNG import terminal at Dahej in Gujarat and has a 5mt facility at Kochi, which is lying mostly idle because of the lack of a pipeline to take the gas to consumers. Royal Dutch Shell operates a 5mt-a-year terminal at Hazira in Gujarat and a 1.2mt facility at Dabhol in Maharashtra. While the Dahej terminal is being expanded to 15mt this year and to 18mt in the future, the construction of a breakwater will take capacity to 5mt at Dabhol. Pradhan also said the first LNG-driven bus was likely to start plying in Kerala early next month. ""Petronet LNG and IOC are in discussions with the Kerala government."" Meanwhile, the cabinet has approved a new method to revise the price of sugarcane-extracted ethanol used for blending in petrol, resulting in a drop in rates by Rs 3 to Rs 39 a litre.<> Among the new terminals being built is a 5 million tonnes facility by GSPC-Adani at Mundra in Gujarat, Adani-IOC-GAIL combine's similar capacity unit at Dhamra in Odisha and another equal capacity terminal by IOC at Ennore in Tamil Nadu. Shell and GAIL are looking at building a floating LNG import terminal at Kakinada with initial capacity of 1.75 million tonnes. India's natural gas demand is expected to grow from 473 million standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd) now to 494 mmscmd in 2017-18 and 523 mmscmd in 2018-19. Ethanol The price of ethanol will be determined on the basis of prevalent price of sugar in the open market as also demand-supply situation, Pradhan said. ""Any pricing mechanism should be market driven and we are moving towards that in case of ethanol as well,"" he said. The NDA-government had in December 2014 fixed a price of Rs 48.50-49.50 per litre for procurement of ethanol for blending with petrol. ""The rate paid to sugar mills was never Rs 48.50. It was Rs 42. That price (Rs 48.50) was after including excise duty, VAT and other levies and transportation cost,"" he said. Oil companies have to necessarily blend up to 10 per cent of ethanol in petrol. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs ""approved the mechanism for revision of ethanol price for supply to public sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) to carry out the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme,"" an official statement said. For ethanol supply period from December 1, 2016 to November 30, 2017, the administered price of ethanol for the EBP programme will be Rs 39 per litre, it said. Additionally, charges will be paid to the ethanol suppliers as per actuals in case of excise duty and VAT/GST and transportation charges as decided by OMCs. ""If the need arises to increase/reduce the retail selling price of petrol by public sector OMCs, then such increase/ reduction would proportionately factor in the requirement of maintaining the fixed cost of purchase of ethanol during the ethanol supply year,"" it said. With the domestic gas output dropping, import of the environment-friendly fuel presents the best option. Using LNG directly as a fuel will help to skip a step of converting the imported liquid gas back into the gaseous state."

Normally, whenever an agent was successful in finding a donor, he would inform the corresponding agent that rajma had been sent for the mehmaan, meaning a kidney donor had been sent for the recipient, a source said.Based on the version given by one of the donors, an official said that the accused seemed to have a code language for most of the these words, to ensure no eye brows were raised if anyone heard their conversations.There is a pre-determined code for sensitive words, such as kidney, donor, recipient, blood samples, the official said. The code word for blood was sauce, used to inform others that the blood samples were clear and did not have medical problems. Prospective donors with medical conditions such as high blood sugar were not allowed to donate their kidneys by these agents.Suresh Gupta, Maharashtra president of the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), who has been helping the victims in the kidney racket, said he has more proof against the accused persons. I will soon approach the police with another case, where an illegal transplant was conducted on a man residing in the western suburbs of the city, claimed Gupta.Gupta added that they will also take up the case of Sundar Singh, a donor who helped expose the racket and is currently on the run.We will help him convince the police to take a decision about him. Currently, he in hiding because he us worried the police will arrest him.Meanwhile, a senior officer probing the case said they are waiting for some reports from the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) to decide on the next course of action. During our investigation, we forwarded some documents we found suspicious to the DHS. Since the DHS is the proper authority in cases of kidney transplant, we will wait for their report, the officer said.The Powai police are probing the kidney racket busted on July 14, when they stopped an illegal transplant between a donor and recipient who were not related. As per law, for a kidney transplant to take place, the donor and the recipient have to be blood relatives.Soon, the police arrested nine persons, including agents, the donor and the recipient. Then, based on the DHS report, five doctors of LH Hiranandani hospital, including the CEO Dr Sujit Chatterjee, were arrested. The five are currently in judicial custody.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: August 15, 2016 3:07 am"
58ff30327be9e0420db2e2f5,Math to improve blood sugar tests,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161006/jsp/nation/story_112244.jsp,2016-10-06,"New Delhi, Oct. 5: Medical scientists in the US have used mathematics to improve the reliability of the most common test used to assess long-term blood sugar control which in its current form can provide misleading results for up to one in three patients. The scientists have shown that the age of a person's red blood cells can influence levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C), the current standard test to assess long-term blood sugar which does not always provide the true sugar levels. In the new method, the researchers used mathematical techniques to control for the age of the red blood cells and increased the reliability of the HbA1C test. In experiments on 200 diabetes patients, the error rate of the HbA1C test reduced from one in three patients to one in 10 patients. ""What we currently deem as the gold standard for estimating average blood glucose is nowhere as precise as it should be,"" said John Higgins, associate professor of systems biology at the Harvard Medical School and member of the research team. The HbA1C test is expected to provide the average blood glucose over the past three months, but doctors have known for long that HbA1C readings, in some patients, do not reflect true average glucose, but give over-estimates or under-estimates. ""We've known this for long - HbA1C values, in some patients, don't correspond their with actual blood glucose,"" said Ambrish Mithal, chairman of the endocrinology division at the Medanta hospital in Gurgaon. ""Iron-deficiency anaemia and variations of haemoglobin are known to influence HbA1c values - but even after accounting for such variations, we still see some patients whose HbA1C readings we can't explain,"" said Mithal who is familiar with but not associated with the US study. Doctors view HbA1C values, which are supposed to give a three-month blood sugar average, as the best indicator of how the disease is being controlled. Persistently high blood sugar can over cause damage to the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, among other organs, leading to serious complications. This makes accuracy in HbA1C critical. ""Patients receiving under-estimates will think that their disease is well-controlled, when it actually is not. Patients receiving over-estimates are told they are doing a poor job controlling the disease when, in fact, they are doing fine,"" Higgins told The Telegraph via email. Higgins and his co-investigators Roy Malka and David Nathan developed a mathematical model that integrates known information about the chemical reaction between glucose and haemoglobin with known information about the red blood cell lifecycle. The researchers used the model to estimate a patient's average red blood cell age, using existing measurements of glucose and glycated haemoglobin. They published their research today in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Their analysis showed that the age of red blood cells is a major source of the HbA1C variations. While the average lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days, the lifespan may vary from person to person. ""Validation of these results is important, but we think the results are strong enough that it's worth using the method right away,"" Higgins said."

These reforms come at a time when around 50 per cent of the sugar mills in the state are in various degrees of financial distress.Deshmukh said the state was in favour of doing away with the renewal of crushing licenses for the mills. Crushing licenses are issued by the sugar commissionerate before the start of the crushing season, and mills that start operating without it can invite penal action.The need for yearly renewal of crushing licences is cumbersome and the state government is in favour of scrapping it. Mills need to send us a proposal on this and we will take it up with the Centre, to make the necessary changes in the Sugarcane Control Act, he said.The move, Deshmukh said, was in line with the governments attempt to deregulate industries and reduce the number of licences required. He said that the government had already brought down the licences necessary for setting up of industries from 60 to 27. Like other sectors, the sugar sector should be allowed to regulate. We are also in favour of reducing other restrictions, such as aerial distance between two mills, he said.The proposals, he said, should come from the sector and the state would then take it up with the Centre. Last season, 177 mills had gone for crushing.While ruling out immediate financial boosters for the mills, Deshmukh said the state would help in restructuring their loans or selling of excess land to help mills get on their feet.Watch Video: Whats making newsBy 2019, all cane fields in the state should be under drip irrigation, Deshmukh said. During our meeting with sugar millers, it was proposed that the government and the mill owners contribute in setting up of drip facilities along with farmers. We will consider it, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: August 26, 2016 2:26 am"

An organisation representing the sweet-makers has appealed to the Bengal government to lobby the Centre on this count. The sarbhaja (left) and the sarpuria. Pictures by Pranab DebnathBengal science and technology minister Asish Banerjee said his department had received the application submitted by the sweets manufacturers from Krishnagar and it was being ""examined and processed"" before being sent to the Intellectual Property Appellate Board in Chennai, the central government authority that issues the GI tag. ""After the sarpuria and the sarbhaja are included in the GI registry, it will be announced by the state government. We will be happy if the two traditional sweets of Nadia get the GI status,"" Banerjee said. The GI is a name or sign used on certain products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin (for example a town, region or country). The use of a geographical indication acts as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities, is made according to traditional methods and enjoys a certain reputation because of its geographical origin. Ten items from Bengal have received the GI status so far. They are Darjeeling tea, Nakshi kantha, Santipur sari, Baluchari sari, Dhaniakhali sari, Joynagarer moa, Santiniketan leather goods and three varieties of mangoes - Laxman Bhog, Himsagar and Fazli. Sarpuria is made by mixing cottage cheese (chhana) with sugar, kheer, groundnut, cardamom, pistachio and saffron and steaming it. Sarbhaja is fried cottage cheese and kheer layered with cream (sar) and dipped in sugar syrup. The assistant secretary of the Krishnagar Mistanna Byabsayee Welfare Samiti, Tapas Das, said that while applying for the GI registration, ""we submitted a brief history of the sarpuria and the sarbhaja and references to the two sweets in the ancient literature of Nadia"". Das said the two sweetmeats had been mentioned in Krishnadas Kabiraj's 16th century hagiography on Sri Chaitanya - Srichaitanya Charitamrita. Sarpuria is also mentioned in Hasir Gaan, a book authored by poet and playwright Dwijendralal Roy. Goutam Das, the owner of the 100-year-old Adhar Chandra Das and Sons in Krishnagar, said: ""We welcome the initiative taken by our samiti. Both the sarpuria and the sarbhaja are ancient sweetmeats of the district and they deserve the GI tag."""

The state excise department has accused a molasses-based distillery owned by Guttes firm, Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Limited, of illegally supplying ethanol or rectified spirit for manufacture of illicit liquor.The department, led by BJPs Chandrasekhar Bavankule, has even served the firm a notice, threatening to suspend the licence for the alleged violation. The firms plant is in Parbhani.Gutte had close ties with former Union Minister (late) Gopinath Munde and had even unsuccessfully contested the 2014 assembly poll from Gangakhed taluka as the official candidate of the BJP-led alliance. Last year, Income Tax authorities had raided Guttes flagship firm, Sunil Hitech. The firm had also courted controversy over a contract allotted in Parbhani under Jalyukt Shivar.In its notice, the department alleged that it had intercepted a tanker (MH04 DS 9808) containing 20,000 litres of duty-evaded rectified spirit from Ahmednagar on September 6, 2016. The tankers driver and cleaner, who were arrested, told investigators that the consignment, meant to be taken for a notorious alcohol maker who operates along the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border, had allegedly originated from Guttes distillery. Sources said about 1 crore litres of alcohol, worth several crores, could be brewed using this spirit.Further, investigators came across a telephonic conversation between the driver and the distillerys manager, Balasaheb Lohar, on the same day for collection of the consignment. The department claims to have further collected evidence, which shows that the same tanker had transported declared goods out of the distillery in the past. Sources revealed that CCTV footage from the distillerys unit is being investigated.A raid subsequently conducted on the distillery revealed the presence of unaccounted for molasses, investigators claimed. The department notice used this as evidence to suggest that the firms intention was to divert this for manufacture of illicit alcohol.The Indian Express accessed the firms written reply to the departments notice, where it denied the accusations. While admitting that Lohar was employed with the distillery, the firm denied any links with the tanker operator and the alcohol maker.The firm also said the molasses found in the distillery had been gained in surplus during sugar production this year. It further said that an application to regularise this surplus was rejected on June 14 without citing any ground. Senior officials, however, said the firms explanation wasnt satisfactory.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Kapu leader and former Kakinada MP Mudragada Padmanabham and his wife Padmavathi began their indefinite hunger strike at 9 am Friday at their residence in Kirlampudi in East Godavari district.The strike is a symbolic representation of the widespread poverty of the Kapus against the general notion that they are economically advanced.My demands are simple, grant Rs 1900 crore for the Kapu Corporation for the two years and grant BC status to Kapus, Mudragada told the media before sitting on hunger strike, adding he was prepared to give up the strike even if the government reduces the BC commissions timeframe from six to three months.A team of doctors monitoring his health said Friday evening that his sugar levels have dropped.Despite police imposing section 144 across the district and restricting movement between Kirlampudi and nearby towns, a steady stream of Kapu activists and well-wishers have been reaching Kirlampudi to express solidarity with Mudragada. Police were seen allowing supporters in batches to Mudragadas residence.Signalling that it is open for negotiation, the state government Thursday night despatched its Kapu leaders Tota Trimurtulu, Bonda Umamaheswar Rao and Boddu Bhasakara Rama Rao to persuade Mudragada to give up the strike action. But the leaders returned to Vijayawada without any assurances from the former MP.On Friday four ministers out of the six Cabinet Sub-Committee members have met Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu who is in Visakhapatnam for the International Fleet Review and apprised him of the situation.Objecting to the governments handling of the Kapu agitation for a BC status, opposition YSR Congress said it supports Mudragada Padmanabhams strike action.Speaking to reporters here Friday, party spokesperson Ambati Rambabu said police are harassing Kapu community in the Godavari districts by taking their pictures and threatening action against them, instead of including them in the reservation list without affecting the BCs."

Modi did not suggest any immediate interventions of his own.The long term impact on commodity markets could be significant.Last month, India made its first purchases of corn in 16 years. It has also been increasing purchases of other products, such as lentils and oilmeals, as production falls short.Wheat and sugar stocks, while sufficient in warehouses now, are depleting fast, leading some traders to predict the need for imports next year.""There's a complete collapse of Indian agriculture, and that's because of the callous neglect by the government,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst.""Given the state of agriculture, I'm not surprised to see India emerging as an importer of a number of food items. Maize is just the beginning.""GROWING DISTRESSAgriculture contributes nearly 13 percent to India's $2 trillion economy and employs about two-thirds of its 1.25 billion people.Government sources said that boosting irrigation, raising crop yields and encouraging farmers to avail of a new crop insurance scheme unveiled in January will help address growing distress in the countryside caused by poor harvests.Modi has already loosened controls on some imports.But one of his biggest dilemmas is that although imports can help cool prices - a key concern for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's core middle-class voter base - farmers see them as benefiting foreign producers at the cost of locals.In a recent interview with television channel ET Now, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government was aware of the impact two bad monsoons have had.""That now tells me, please spend more on irrigation,"" he said.The farm sector needs to grow at about 3 percent to help Jaitley achieve his target of 7 to 7.5 percent economic growth in the 2015/16 fiscal year.In the first half of this fiscal year, agricultural growth fell to 2 percent from 2.4 percent a year earlier.WHO ARE THE WINNERS?India's entry into the market as a net importer is good news for suppliers like Brazil, Argentina, the United States and Canada, which are suffering from a global commodity glut.India's move to import corn, for example, has supported global prices. Corn values rose 2.6 percent after India said on Jan. 13 that it would launch a second tender for 200,000 tonnes, its second since announcing plans to buy half a million tonnes.Traders say India may need to import another 1.5-2.0 million tonnes.The next big import item on the list could be oilmeals, an animal feed, which India used to export in large quantities until last year.""Very soon we'll be left with no choice but to import oilmeals, largely because our oilseed production has failed to keep pace with our demand for both vegetable oils and oilmeals,"" said B.V.

Picture by Avik Chakraborty Dibrugarh, Oct. 15: Police today seized 5.2kg of narcotic drugs, which is said to be one of the biggest such seizures in the state, from a house owned by a KMSS leader. Based on specific information, the police raided a rented house in the Amolapatty area of Dibrugarh and seized 2kg of heroin and 3.2kg of brown sugar. The police said the main accused, Sirbek Ahmed, was absconding. They, however, detained Tajuddin Ahmed, the landlord of the house. Tajuddin is the general secretary of peasants' rights body Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS)'s Dibrugarh unit. Two others, Arif Ali (relative of the main accused) and a housemaid, have also been picked up for questioning. ""It is a huge haul, probably the biggest drug consignment seized in the state. Unfortunately we could not catch the main accused as he had left the house with an accomplice just moments before the raid. We have come to know that he is carrying with him a consignment of contraband drugs for delivery. We are trying to track him down,"" Dibrugarh superintendent of police Gautam Borah told The Telegraph. Borah said 15 drug dealers and peddlers have been arrested since a drive was launched in the district in May this year. The police said their biggest success so far was the arrest of drug lord Elahi Sheikh on July 8. Sheikh, considered to be the kingpin of illicit narcotics trade in Upper and central Assam, used to run his business from Panchali and Kalibari areas in Dibrugarh town with the help of a close-knit network, primarily comprising school dropouts and women peddlers. Brown sugar is an adulterated form of heroin. Pure heroin is a white crystalline powder, referred to as white sugar by abusers. Brown sugar contains 20 per cent of heroin while the remaining 80 per cent is chalk powder, zinc oxide and even strychnine. The drug is either sniffed, smoked or injected. An overdose can cause slow and shallow breathing, circulatory failure, convulsions, coma or death."
58ff39a57be9e0420db2eb7a,Tribals Mahasweta touched back to cursed life,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161022/jsp/bengal/story_114891.jsp,2016-10-22,"Little Sabars in Akhodbandh village ;villagers play a game of cards in the Sabar village of Bangthupi. Pictures by Snehamoy Chakraborty Purulia, Oct. 21: The Sabar community, the centrepiece of Mahasweta Devi's work, is not very well. Kajali Sabar and her husband Sarat make tea by boiling CTC tea leaves in water with salt. They cannot afford sugar. Kajali and Sarat live in Balakdih Sabar Tola, a village 36km from Purulia town. Around 12,000 Sabars live in Purulia's 164 Sabar tolas. The Sabars were never very well, the reason why Mahasweta Devi, the writer-activist who won the Magsaysay Award, stepped into their lives. British law had declared the Sabars a ""criminal"" tribe in 1872 and they had been ""decriminalised"" in independent India, but when Mahasweta Devi came in, they were still regarded as criminals, being arrested and tortured indiscriminately by police with a little help from other communities. Mahasweta Devi fought on behalf of the Sabars, questioning their ""criminality"", trying to lift them from utter poverty and alienation. They called her mother. At the Sabar Mela in Purulia in 1983, she was anointed ""Sabarer Ma"". She brought them hope - and livelihood. She began to market and sell their handicrafts. But it was short-lived. Her presence was withdrawn from their lives from the time she fell ill five or six years ago, and finally with her death this year on July 28. The Sabars are not picked up for every crime in the neighbourhood any more. But otherwise they are back to where Mahasweta Devi found them: utter poverty and alienation, nursing only a few habits picked up from their recent encounter with the world. Twenty years ago, a Sabar did not know tea. ""We saw people in nearby villages,"" says Sarat, in his late 50s, who makes his living by collecting wood from the forest. ""We can't afford sugar and wanting milk is pointless. We boil water with some tea and salt. It is our tea,"" says Kajali. Finding work is more difficult than finding milk. Says Mahadeb Sabar, a 60-year-old man who folded his hands in respect at the mention of Mahasweta Devi: ""When Ma came to us, we could earn about Rs 1,500 a week by selling our handicrafts. Now it is hard to earn Rs 400 a week from selling these."" In the absence of the projects Mahasweta Devi brought them, many Sabars are turning back to selling wood. This is not easy, as cutting trees is illegal without replantation, and Sabars are facing resistance from forest officials. In Bangthupi Sabar Tola, another Sabar village, Meghnad Sabar, a youth who passed Madhyamik in 2008, then stopped his education, became a labourer and married at 18. ""Two months in monsoon we work as farm labourers as all fields here are single-crop. The rest of the months we cut trees and sell in the markets in Kenda or Puncha blocks in Purulia. My daily income is about Rs 60,"" says Meghnad. ""We only eat once during the day,"" he says. The one proper meal they have is ""just phenabhat (starch rice) with salt"", he adds. Meghnad has a television set and a mobile phone, but neither works because he does not have the money to repair them. Mahasweta Devi, who had been visiting Jharkhand's Palamau tribal areas since the sixties, was introduced to the Sabars in the eighties by activist Gopi Ballabh Singh Deo, or ""Gopibabu"", a retired schoolteacher. Gopibabu, 82, who lives in Rajnowagarh village in Purulia, had already been working for the uplift of the Sabars for two decades. He founded the Paschim Banga Kheriya Sabar Kalyan Samiti in 1968. The Sabars were ""decriminalised"" in 1952, but only in name. The police would allegedly conduct raids and torture them for every crime in their area. "" Ghorey ghumai murdhumsa, Chorey kate dhan. Jodi kaukey na pali to kheriya dhorey aan (The fat landlord sleeps and thieves cut off paddy from land. If no one can be caught, go catch a Sabar),"" the Sabars would say. The complaint that Sabars don't fit in persists, making it difficult for them to find work and even get state scheme benefits. Gopibabu is unable to speak because of his ill health. Prashanta Rakshit, the current director of the Paschim Banga Kheriya Sabar Kalyan Samiti, which has its head office in Rajnowagarh, says Gopibabu had acted as a shield for the tribe from the police, running from one place to another to protect the Sabars from the law-enforcers' torture. ""He is the pioneer of the movement for the Sabar tribe,"" says Rakshit. The 1983 Sabar Mela had been organised to bring together members of the tribe people on one platform so that they could fight together for their rights. Mahasweta Devi, who had already written Aranyer Adhikar (The rights of a forest), her novel on the tragic, brilliant life of Santhal leader Birsa Munda, was with them. Later she would write Byadhkanda (The book of the hunter), a historical novel about Kalketu, the founder of the Sabar tribe. It is a passionate appeal to preserve the Sabar world. ""It is not that the tragedy of our life ended as soon as our mother Mahasweta Devi promised to be with us,"" says Jaladhar Sabar, secretary of the Kheriya Sabar Samiti. As the tragedy of Chuni Kotal would prove soon. The first woman graduate among the Lodha Sabars, Chuni, who graduated in 1985, could not bear her harassment in the workplace, a cell made for the welfare of Sabars. She committed suicide in 1992. Mahasweta Devi had reported the incident to the police. ""But it was the beginning of a movement. Most important, we learnt to fight the police and the government,"" Jaladhar Sabar says. The custodial death of Budhon Soren in 1998 was another flashpoint. Budhon, from Akarhbaid village, was believed to have been beaten to death in police custody, but his death was shown as suicide. After the post-mortem, the Sabars kept his body at his home for further autopsy, tricking the police by burning a false pier. Mahasweta Devi filed a writ petition in Calcutta High Court and a CBI probe was ordered. The case is still being heard. Mahasweta Devi marketed the Sabar handicrafts made traditionally with Kashi Ghas, leaves of date-palm trees and bamboo as far as she could in original ways. ""We began training camps. Within two years the Sabars, mainly women, started to make money. We used to buy handicrafts directly and our organisation sold it at different shops and fairs in Calcutta and Delhi,"" says Rakshit, who travelled with Mahasweta Devi to various countries. ""Didi (Mahasweta Devi) used to keep the handicrafts in her Calcutta home. She would tell visitors: 'I will give you an autograph if you buy one handicraft made by my Sabar daughters',"" Rakshit adds. Not that targeting Sabars ended following Mahasweta Devi's efforts. In 2003, Bhadra Sabar of Tilabani village under Boro police station was killed when villagers allegedly threw stones at him on charges of theft. The police and officials feel that a section of Sabar men were involved mainly in road robbery till one or two years ago. But as Jaladhar Sabar points out: ""The torture by the police has gone down. We will continue our fight to bring proper financial and social development to our people."" That is the big challenge. The Samiti gives legal help and still conducts training for Sabar people to make handicrafts and market these. But it is not enough. It is also clear that Mahasweta Devi's work model was not sustainable. Some other personalities who promised help have disappointed the Sabars. The Samiti members said that in the nineties, five schools opened in Sabar villages, but have closed down recently because of lack of funding. The villagers in Bangthupi and Akarhbaid said no teacher was willing to teach their children as no one can pay. Individuals and organisations who visited the Sabar villages because of Mahasweta Devi have left. Desperate, many Sabars ""upgraded"" their traditional practices into lucrative ones. Earlier the Sabars would make liquor from Mahua, but now they are using molasses and yeast to brew alcohol and sell it. In Bangthupi, a Class VI student was found making hooch in his house. This business makes his family more prosperous than others in the village. ""My left leg was cut off as it was burnt in an accident. I had no option other than selling hooch. I earn Rs 400 in three days,"" says Anil Sabar, the father of the Class VI student. Other Sabars are going the contemporary way: migrating. Sabar women have begun to go to Purulia to work as maids and a large number of young men are migrating to Gujarat, Mumbai or Bangalore to work as construction labourers. Kalyani Sabar from Balakdih village, who received handicrafts training for Mahasweta Devi's projects, has started working as a maid. She is happy. Kalyani is proud that she could spend Rs 4,000 on the last rites of her father and treat all villagers to lunch, comprising fish, chicken, vegetable curry and plenty of rice with aloo posto and chutney. ""I could afford the money only because I started work as a maid. I earn Rs 4,000 easily a month. My son Motilal works as a labourer in Purulia town,"" she says. At least 1,000 Sabar youths, mostly school dropouts, go to other states every year to work as construction labourers and return home with at least Rs 15,000 every four months or so. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has not been much of a help. Few job cards have been updated since 2008. ""I don't know how to get work under the scheme. No one calls us,"" says Uttor Sabar, 40. A district official from Purulia says the Sabar people had not been brought under the government project successfully because of their ""culture"". The Sabars, hunters and wood-gatheres, do not enjoy the kind of work possible under such a scheme, he adds. Same with government institutions. Sabars do not fit in. ""We have provided concrete houses to them under government schemes. Many of them are not concerned about bank accounts or documents, which we provided by going to their villages. We are trying to connect them with the mainstream with Aadhaar card facilities,"" says Ajay Sengupta, the block development officer of Puncha. One solution would be to give agricultural land, Rakshit feels. ""But it would take a special initiative from the government to provide agricultural land for a 'decriminalised' tribe like the Sabars."""

(PTI) New Delhi, Oct. 27: The cabinet today gave in-principle approval to strategic sales in over a dozen state-owned firms, including those that are making profits. ""The recommendations of the NITI Aayog on disinvestment and strategic sale came up for consideration. In principle, the cabinet has approved the recommendations with regard to some of the units,"" finance minister Arun Jaitley said after the meeting. He, however, said the names of the PSUs up for sale would be made public once they were put up for auction. Among the companies being considered for the selloff are Bharat Earth Movers, Container Corporation Ltd, Certification Engineers International, Scooters India Ltd, Bharat Pumps & Compressors Ltd and Balmer Lawrie. NITI Aayog has prepared a list of public sector units where the government can sell its majority stakes to private companies to bring in greater efficiency and professionalism in their functioning. Jaitley said each case would be considered separately after it had been examined by the department of disinvestment and the ministries concerned. ""So, in-principle it has been approved. Specific cases will now come up after a detailed examination as to how it is to be done in each case and the details with regard to the units concerned will be furnished at that stage. This list does not include PSUs for closure,"" he said. The strategic sale will involve the transfer of management control as the shareholding of the government will come down to below 50 per cent. ""Some of these are important units and, therefore, each unit will be considered in its own merit and the timing of that will be decided by the government accordingly,"" he said. On the valuation of these PSUs, he said a transparent process would be followed, adding that it will take into account immovable property and other assets. Sugar stock limit The government today decided to extend stock limits on sugar traders by another six months till April 2017 to check sweetener prices, which are ruling around Rs 40 per kg at present. The main objective of the decision is to enable states to issue control order with the prior concurrence of the Centre to fix stock limits/licensing requirements for sugar, whenever required, an official statement said."

Pictures by Bhola Prasad For a healthy heart's sake, walk, run and shake! Around 5,000 residents of Jamshedpur, including students and professionals, did the first on Thursday to mark World Heart Day, which is Geneva-based nonprofit World Heart Federation's biggest platform for raising awareness about cardiovascular diseases. The 3km circular walkathon from near Keenan Stadium in Bistupur was organised by Brahmananda Narayana Multispeciality Hospital. Chief guest on the occasion was eminent businessman and social worker Bailey Bodhanwala. The enthusiastic crowd included officials and staff of the hospital, members of Lions Club, college students and social activists. The heart rally wended its way through Sakchi roundabout, The Bengal Club area and Pipeline Road in Sakchi before returning to Northern Town near the stadium. Tata Main Hospital (TMH), on the other hand, marked the special day with a function at its auditorium. Tata Steel managing director T.V. Narendran, the chief guest of the programme, felicitated nursing staff. Narendran, in his address to the gathering that comprised doctors, nurses and officials of the hospital, said every man was responsible for 80 per cent of his health problems. ""It is time we adopt a healthy lifestyle and food habits,"" he added. The TMH has also been conducting a sample survey to determine the health index of the steel city since September 20. Blood sugar, hypertension and body mass index were checked at camps organised at five TMH clinics across the city, seven community development centres and on the hospital premises till Wednesday, September 28. ""We checked 2,000 people, but have analysed 1,000.

58ff3cef7be9e0420db2efef,A shared lineage of stylization,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161105/jsp/opinion/story_117428.jsp,2016-11-05,"Ramananda Bandopadhyay and Ramkumar Manna. Two artists from two generations in two shows in two galleries, one a painter and the other a sculptor, but descended from the same lineage of stylization: the rounded proportions, the uncontoured limbs, the wide eyes, the simplified form that you see in much of traditional iconography. The reputed senior, Bandopadhyay, is still very active as he enters the eighth decade of his life and shows his paintings and drawings at Galerie 88 till November 26. The younger artist, Manna, working with quiet conviction for over two decades now, displayed his sculpture at Gallery Range recently. Bandopadhyay's area of enchantment - Hindu lore and women - remains more or less unchanged over the years. As does the language he'd evolved from his Santiniketan training under Nandalal Bose. But whereas Bose moved from his Bengal School style to a lively minimalism, his student has remained faithful to his initial inspiration. Expectedly, therefore, Bandopadhyay plays around as he usually does with the form of the elephant-headed god, playing up the 'cuddle' quotient. Ganesh sleeping, offering puja to a Shiva lingam, chiding his mascot for raiding a container of sweets and so forth. Endearing images, amusing too, no doubt. But so steeped in dj vu have such Ganesh adaptations become from the commercialized cuteness of a god believed to bestow success that there can only be diminishing returns. Unless variations are invented to refresh the form and bring surprise to the mythology around the deity. Yet Bandopadhyay makes the goddess Durga less cloying mainly because of folkish lines and parched colours textured with the grainy paper surface. The artist's women are invested with a symbolic Bengali air in look, dress and manner that recalls an era past and, basically, asserts the artist's concern with form. You can't miss the sugar but it's spiced somewhat with an undertone of amusement that's both sympathetic and detached. The lyrical flow of fine lines and comely gibbousness bathed in glowing shades of red, yellow and green, proclaim Bengal's mother goddess as an ideal of beauty and is part of the stylistic convention the artist is accustomed to. When depicted in pairs or groups -as in Nos. 5, 6, 9, 10 - the women seem to be both idealized and everyday, rather human, rapt in light-hearted, convivial, perhaps typically feminine, gossipy exchanges. However, you do wonder if this period boudoir ethos hasn't outlived its sanitized prettiness. The one exception in this group is No. 4. Its satiric narrative goes back to the Kalighat pat, with a little drama of subtle chemistry woven around its threesome of babu, bibi and woh: of sanctioned possessiveness fending off with arch confidence a tentative, lovelorn intrusion. On the other hand, where fine, flowing lines give way to smudgy pastel trails and jerky angles - as in Nos. 7 and 19 - it immediately imports the throb of life into the mannered idiom. No. 23 is the example to cite for here Bandopadhyay resorts to a quaint verticality of perspective. No. 22 must be mentioned as well for its breezy lines reminiscent of the Santiniketan masters, Baij and Benode Behari. Completely different in tone are the monochromatic ink sketches with their spry abbreviations and touches of humour. Unfortunately, though these drawings are some of the best works, just a few of them are included in this show. What must be noted about Manna is that he's self-taught and has evolved his own technique of building up tallish terracotta sculptures and firing them. The title, PerForm, immediately suggests a double meaning: performance - particularly by musicians - and the exploration of form. Which, like Bandopadhyay's, is summary, reductive, with naturalistic details edited out, and refers mainly to tribal grammar. The exhibition note says that the sculptor saw it all in a dream: musicians performing silently in an empty space. Such visions do float across a twilight consciousness but only the creative can translate these experiences into art. And what the gallery does is try and approximate the dream atmosphere in its arrangement: lights trained on each sculpture, leaving the rest of the space bare and soothingly, silently, dark. Standing or seated, the men and a few women clasp or cradle an assortment of instruments - percussion, wind, string - lost in concentration. There were also some works in plaster that have been given an arresting bronze patina. Shown alongside Manna's sculptures were the paintings of Dipankar Sankrityayan, representing the contemporary generation. Colourful though they are, the young artist still has some way to go to channel multiple influences into an individual voice."
58ff3d097be9e0420db2f008,Chhath at the crossroads,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161106/jsp/bihar/story_117672.jsp,2016-11-06,"Religiosity is on the streets. The roads are full of religious commerce. Crowd, an unmanageable crowd, overlapping the shops of various concerns, horn-blowing, smoke-emitting vehicles, packed plastic bags with items of religious rituals can be seen all over the streets. Interestingly, I noticed a thela that has chicken chilly written on it that has changed its business for some pious days and was now selling hawan samagri. Chhath geet (at times with DJ effect) played in the background. I could sense the sound of blowing horns and religious fervour entering my ears simultaneously. I found myself on a strange crossroads of tradition and modernity, religious spirituality and rituals, faith and commerce, Bhakti and bargain, Sun God and smoking vehicles depleting the ozone layer. I was compelled to interrogate and introspect, why we celebrate Chhath Puja? Whom do we worship? What is the procedure? Chhath is celebrated six days after Deepawali in the month of Karthik. It is a four-day procedure beginning from Nahay Khay. On this day the one who is to observe the fast usually takes a holy bath in a river, preferably in the Ganga or Kosi. After purification, they have boiled rice and water guard prepared in ghee and rock salt, once during the day. Manypeople use the Holy water of the Ganges to prepare the prasad. Next day is called Kharna. On this day, the person observing Chhath fasts for the whole day and eats once after sunset. The meal is that of kheer and puri. The purity measures are strictly taken care of. After this, they are set for a 36-hour fast. The third day is evening arghya. The person fasts for the whole day. The day is spent in preparing the offering of thekua, a sweet preparation of wheat flour, sugar and ghee. The preparation is arranged on bamboo baskets known as soop and daura. Other items in the basket include fruits, aarta made up of cotton, areca nut, clove, cardamom, turmeric, ginger etc. The person along with the family members goes to the bank of the river and offers arghya to the evening Sun. The prayer concludes the next day with offering of arghya to the morning Sun. The procedures take place while people present there sing the Chhath geet. These songs include the rituals, protocol, wishes and the prayers to the Sun God and Chhathi Mata. These songs are dedicated to Chhathi Mata as well as Sooraj (Sun) devta. The Sun is worshipped with the belief that it can heal many diseases. So, Chhath is observed toget an illness-free life. Moreover, the wishes are very material. The songs include the wishes for sons, daughters, their weddings and children. People pray for health as well as wealth and there is a direct prayer to the Sun God without any priestly intervention and mediation. There is no certainty regarding the history of this fast and also about who this Chhathi Mata is! Some people believe her to be the goddess of fertility whereas others think she is Shashthi Devi. But there is no authoritative record of the same. Many people observing this fast are unaware of any history or mythology of this but everyone tends to have faith inthis puja and also a belief that the wishes are fulfilled by observing this long fast. The God and the Goddess fulfil the wishes by being happy with the penitence. Purity and hygiene are of utmost importance in this puja. What is interesting is a strange amalgamation of the folk and the priestly. Some people trace it to the age of the Vedas; some trace it to the Ramayan whereas some think that the Mahabharat has the first reference to such a fast. But what is important is to notice its implication in the present. We are at an age and stage of globalisation where commerce is expanding internationally. Moreover, we are in a computer age of rationality and scientific temper. We are in a hurry to accept the new, the modern, the international and the multinational. In this race, there is always a threat of merging identities and thereby losing individual identities. This is a difficult situation where one wants to unburden oneself of the past in order to accept the new and at the same time mourn the loss with a sense of nostalgia. This feeling of nostalgia compels us to keep some reminiscence of the past in the form of a relic. I notice the same pattern in case of Chhath Puja, a ritual that takes place twice a year. There is no harm in following certain norms, observing a particular fast or having faith in a certain god but the problem lies in accepting it uncritically.This is the charm of a relic that one does not have to be critical of it. At times a sense of fear is instilled to keep the ritual going without much interrogation. This uncritical faith is termed Bhakti and thus the ritual gets repeated undisturbed by the passage of time. It is co-opted in the time we live in and that is what forms the crossroads. The puja appears to take place somewhere else for someone not among us. Theoretically, this is a worship of a very important element of nature but somehow the deification of this element makes it an alien phenomenon without a direct responsibility toward ecology. One tends to be particular about the ritualistic form of worship but this form of worship does not take any responsibility of ecological concern. One may feel proud of one's tradition that nature worship is alive even in rituals but one needs to be critical whether it is alive only in the form of a ritual. It is because of this uncritical faith that we find ourselves at the crossroads. Plastic bags pollute the environment whereas purity measures are strictly observed. The Sun God is worshipped and the number of patients with vitamin D deficiency is increasing remarkably. Pollution level is rising and so is insistence in the ritual. Should we not ask ourselves why doesnt our faith translate into an everyday behaviour? Why do we prefer four days of holiness? Most importantly why is nature worship not saving our nature? I think the answer to this relic form of Bhakti is a constantinterrogation. That might just help us to cross the crossroads."

Old, dilapidated houses line the road cheek by jowl. Breaking the grey monotony is the bright red, palatial building named Nrisinghaniloy, which is the residence of the Boses of Ramkrishnapur. The Durga idol at Nrishinghaniloy in Ramkrishnapur. Picture by Anup Bhattacharya The Boses host one of the oldest Durga Pujas on the west bank of the Hooghly, which started in 1840. It is said that the Late Ishwar Chandra Bose travelled from Singti Shibpur village in Amta to Calcutta in search of a livelihood. He found a job at the Calcutta jetty, the dock area, before the Sepoy Mutiny. He won a stevedore contract and slowly laid the foundation of EC Bose and Company. Once he established himself, and built Nrisinghaniloy in Howrah, he called for his family. Historian Nemai Sadhan Bose belonged to this family. The Boses used to organise a Durga Puja at their Amta house, albeit on a smaller scale. At their Ramkrishnapur residence a thakurdalan was built for the purpose and Durga Puja started here in 1840. We have been organising Durga Puja since then without a break following the family tradition, said Gautam Sadhan Bose, a fifth generation member of the family. According to tradition, on the day of Nanda Utsab, a day after Janmashtami, a family member collects Ganga mati and puts the first layer of clay on the bamboo skeleton of Durga. The idol is built at the thakurdalan by an artisan family from Midnapore, who have been doing it for three generations, said Bose. Durga wears the daker saaj and her weapons are of silver. Her bahan, the lion, is of a silver colour too. We dont know why it is so, but it has been like that since the beginning. When I was a boy I asked about it and was told that since the lion lives with Durga in the snow-clad Kailash, it is white, said Gautam Sadhan. Puja to the goddess has started since Pratipad, the day after Mahalaya. The Bodhon will happen on Sashthi, said Bose. There used to be animal sacrifice on Sandhi Puja. The khadga or chopper for sacrifice still hangs from the ante room at thakurdalan. Animal sacrifice stopped around 1942. We offer fruits and sugar to the deity instead, said the family member. Women in the household take charge of all the preparations. We offer luchi and bhaja for bhog prepared by a Brahmin, he added. On the day of Biswarjan, the deity is carried on shoulder to the nearest ghat for immersion. Locals participate in our puja in a big way. Our puja has always been open to all. The grandeur has been curtailed a bit with the passage of time, but not much. It is one of the oldest pujas in Howrah. The next generation will find it tough to carry on, but carry on they will, said Gautam Sadhan with conviction."

Aaradhya had cleared a major portion of his loan.Even though the deputy commissioner had asked the bank authorities not to take any action against the farmer, the bank acted in an inhumane manner. The bank did not serve any prior notice before the auction and a complaint has been registered in this regard. The state and Central governments have failed to protect the farmers. The KRRS will stage a protest against the bank and the government in Bengaluru on June 14 he said.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had said that the production of foodgrains in the state has declined by 15,000 tonnes, but he has not bothered to safeguard the interest of farmers. This year, the state will suffer 70% sugar cane shortage as many farmers have lost the crops. The state government will pay a heavy price for neglecting agri sector. Though the farmers in Mandya have been staging a protest against the government for the past one month, no peoples representative has bothered to visit them, Puttanaiah said.Meet in HubballiThe KRRS has organised a meet on July 9 and 10 at Hubballi to chalk out various programmes and to plan future agitations for the welfare of farmers. Nearly 200 pro-farmer thinkers like writer Devanur Mahadeva, Swaraj Abhiyan leaders Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav, activist S R Hiremath and others will participate in the meet.KRRS will also organise a two-day study camp for farmers at Sri Adichunchanagiri Mutt in Mandya district on June 6 and 7.

Out of 203 lakes in the district, 159 have completely dried up.All seven taluks of the district have been declared drought-hit by the government. Most of the lakes in the district, including those under Cauvery catchment area, have dried up.It may be mentioned that the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) reservoir did not reach its maximum level last year. The current water level in the KRS dam has slumped to 79 ft against the maximum level of 124.80 ft. Release of water into canals had been stopped from March end itself.According to a survey, out of 203 lakes in the district, 44 lakes are partially filled, while the remaining have totally dried up. So, there is no water for drinking in several villages. The farmers of the region say, the lakes should have been filled before water was released into canals. While a few lakes were filled, some were left out.When officials found itdifficult to release water for irrigation purpose to save the crops, the filling of lakes took a back seat. A few lakes irrigate hundreds of acres of land situated in the lower region (kelegade pradesha). As those lakes have dried up, the farmers could neither cultivatepaddy, sugar cane nor any and other crop this year, pushing them into financial straits, the farmers explained.DepletionWith a majority of the lakes drying up, the water table has depleted to an alarming level. Water is not available, even after drilling 600 ft at a few taluks in the district, it is said. The drying up of lakes has affected livestock to a great extent. Lakes play a major role in maintenance of cattle for washing, drinking and others.Most of the lakes are filled with silt. Desilting works has not been taken up for several years now. While desilting was done under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) at some places, some others have been left unattended. It is also alleged that the drying up of lakes has been misused by vested interests, who have been encroaching them."

Due to inadequate rainfall in the district, most of the crops have withered away. It is estimated that crops cultivated on total 74,783 hectares of land in the district have withered away, with losses running into at least Rs 43.76 crore.The period between April and September are considered to be monsoon months. Usually, sowing of crops takes place during these months. The district normally receives 724 mm of rainfall. For the last few years, unfortunately, the figures are not encouraging. Kolar district has been receiving less than the normal rainfall.A variety of crops are cultivated in the district, which includes, paddy, jowar, ragi, maize, tur dal, chick peas, black gram, green gram, groundnuts, cow peas, sesame, sunflower, palm seeds, soya, mustard, cotton, Indian beans, sugar cane and tobacco.These crops form the main backbone of agricultural produce. This year around, the district had set a target of conducting sowing operations on at least 1,02 lakh hectares of land for the monsoon crops. However, sowing was undertaken in total 82,111 hectares of land.While mapping the rains during monsoon this year, the district was blessed with fairly good rainfall during the months of April, May, June and July. The enthused farmers, took up sowing operations on a largescale. Past July, rains began throwing tantrums. This proved to be detrimental for the crops. While, most of the seeds did not germinate at all in some of the places. At most of the places, the standing crops withered away due to lack of rainfall.The officials of the Revenue department and the Agriculture department have begun a joint survey of the crop loss in the district. They have estimated that crops cultivated in at least 74,783 hectares of land have suffered damage. Of this, more than 33 per cent of crops have withered away in total 66,972 hectares of land and at least 64,356 hectares of land out of this, is rain-fed.The highest crop loss has been reported in Bangarpet taluk, with crops having withered away in 17,911 hectares of land.

The government has decided to release water into canals from Kabini reservoir for six days but it will not help the farmers as the water will not reach the tail-end villages.He demanded the government to release 1,800 cusecs of water per day for 10 days continuously in three phases. Around 30% of crops have already withered due to shortage of water, he said.CompensationOn the issue of compensation, the KRRS leader alleged that the governments - Centre and the state - are following unscientific methods in fixing the compensation for crop loss. While the farmers have incurred a loss of Rs 46,000 loss per acre of paddy, the government has fixed a compensation of Rs 5,650 per hectare. Karnataka Agriculture Commission has prepared a report on expenses incurred for cultivation and the government must fix the compensation based on the Commissions report, he demanded.Despite the fact that the price of sugar has doubled in a year or two, sugar cane farmers are not getting their due.

Who has stopped them?.The growth rate of Hindu population is declining because of insecurity, inequality among the people of the religion. When the religion, which is made for the development of the people, fails to think about the welfare of the people, then obviously, people think why they should be a part of the religion, he opined.Kharge recalled the contributions and ideologies of the 12th Century social reformer Basavanna who aspired for casteless and classless society through his Anubhava Mantapa.While majority of the mutts are playing constructive role in the development of the society and country, divisive elements are endangering social fabric of the nation.

So, the same variety of crop is being cultivated in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha too.Switch to new varietyRam felt that in the case of Karnataka, barring minor variations due to climatic factors, there is not much change in the scenario. The reason being, no variety change ever since the existing variety (CO 62175) was introduced in the year 1962. The area of cultivation is more than 60 per cent and its time to switch over to a new variety to improve the yield and also sugar recovery, he said.Effective management of soil health and also measures to check pests are other factors that would help in better cultivation of sugar cane, Ram added.R B Khandagave from S Nijalingappa Sugar Institute, Belagavi advised to take a cue from Australia, where the thrust is on technology and adoption of minimal recommendations in managing fertility of the soil. Khandagave said, to ensure better margins in sugar cane farming, two priorities should be followed  judicious use of soil and water and bringing down the production cost. In the case of soil and water management, Australia would be a better model by incorporating technologies, while solar pumpsets would help reduce production cost.Director, Research, University of Agriculture Sciences (UAS), Bengaluru, T Sheshadri blamed impartial adoption of technologies in the realm as the major reason for problems plaguing sugar cane farmers. The farmers have failed to fully explore the potential. As a result, there is no change in the extent of production in the last five years, that can be recorded at 450 tonnes per hectare.Sheshadri pointed out, usage of local seeds, deterioration in soil health, non-adoption of organic manure, green manure and inter-cropping system and also failure in management of trash and poor drainage system, especially in low-lying areas, are among the causes that have resulted in farmers incurring loss in sugar cane cultivation.MCC Commissioner C G Betsurmath released the compendium on sugar cane cultivation in the region."

Even the prices of all tobacco products will go up with the imposition of 15 per cent excise duty.Potential car buyers will have to shell out more, from as low as Rs 3,000 to over Rs 1 lakh, on new purchases as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced infrastructure cess of up to 4 per cent on vehicles.The pollution and traffic situation in Indian cities is a matter of concern. I propose to levy an infrastructure cess, of 1 per cent on small petrol, LPG, CNG cars, 2.5 per cent on diesel cars of certain capacity and 4 per cent on other higher engine capacity vehicles and SUVs, Jaitley said.Petrol / LPG / CNG-driven vehicles of length not exceeding 4 metres and engine capacity not exceeding 1,200cc would attract a cess of 1 per cent. Diesel-driven vehicles of length not exceeding 4 metre and engine capacity not exceeding 1,500cc will attract a cess of 2.5 per cent, while other higher engine capacity and SUVs and bigger sedans would be levied at 4 per cent.Moreover, cars priced above Rs 10 lakh will also attract tax of 1 per cent at source.I also propose to collect tax at source at the rate of 1 per cent on purchase of luxury cars exceeding value of Rs 10 lakh and purchase of goods and services in cash exceeding Rs two lakh, Jaitley added.Even air travel will become expensive due increase in excise duty on aviation turbine fuel (ATF).Soft drinksSoft drinks and mineral water will also be dearer as Jaitley proposed to hike excise duty on water including mineral water, aerated water containing added sugar or sweetening matter to 21 per cent from 18 per cent earlier.Branded ready-made garments costing Rs 1,000 or more will become costlier as the excise duty on them has been increased to 2 per cent without CENVAT credit from nil earlier.Customs duty on imported imitation jewellery and industrial solar water heater has increased. Locally manufactured mobiles will become costlier by about 1 per cent because government has imposed duty on imported circuit boards used in them.Legal services to cost moreAvailing of legal services through senior advocates or legal firms will cost more as such activity will no longer be exempted from service tax with Jaitley proposing a levy of 14 per cent.Travelling by hiring air-conditioned stage carriage, hiring of agency to pack and move household items and shifting premises, imported golf cars, lottery tickets, imported e-reading devices will be expensive. Other items that will become dearer include instruments for VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) and refined gold bars manufactured from gold dore bars.CheaperOn the other hand, footwear, solar lamps, router, broadband modems and set top boxes will become cheaper.Digital video recorder and CCTV cameras, hybrid electric vehicles, micro-ovens produced in the country became cheaper.In order to bring down the cost of kidney dialysis of patients suffering from end-stage renal disease, excise duty on disposable sterilised dialyser from been reduced to NIL from 12.5 per cent earlier."

The audit exercise will offer him leads to build perception on individual ministers performance ahead of Cabinet reshuffle which is expected soon after the Budget Session in late March.Earlier in the day, Modi chaired his ninth interaction through PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation)  the multi-modal review platform.Taking strong exception of complaints and grievances from people, related to the customs and excise sector, the prime minister asked for strict action against responsible officials, the PMO said in a release. He urged all secretaries whose departments have extensive public dealing, to set up a system for top-level monitoring of grievances immediately.Among the significant projects reviewed were the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link, the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and the Jal Marg Vikas Project from Allahabad to Haldia. He also reviewed the progress of the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana and implementation of the National Old Age Pension Scheme.The cabinet secretary also made a presentation on the works of each of ministries like Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Civil Supplies, Water Resources and Fertilisers. The idea was that the five ministries should know the works done by each other.The presentation on fFertiliser Ministry included reviving fertiliser plants, including the one in Gorakhpur. In the presentation on Agriculture Ministry, emphasis was laid on the prime minister's scheme for irrigation."

With no money for seeds and no water for irrigation, farmers have gone desperate, local Congress leaders alleged.With Opposition parties getting active in the region in run up to the 2017 Assembly polls, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has said his government would make necessary efforts to address the issues.Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan recently visited the region to take stock of the developmental scheme and Yadav said he himself would visit Bundelkhand.""We have taken a decision on the works to be carried out under MNREGA... In coming times, I'll also visit Bundelkhand. My government will help the region in every possible way,"" the Chief Minister had said.Over a month back, Rahul Gandhi had visited the western UP to interact with sugarcane growers hit hard due to failure of sugar mills to give their dues.The Congress Vice President reffered to Modi becoming ""emotional"" yesterday while expressing grief over the suicide by a dalit scholar Rohith Vemula at Hyderabad University and said the PM should also show empathy for the farmers who are providing ""the food you eat"".Addressing villagers during his nearly seven-kilometre-long foot-march, he demanded that some of the money saved by the government due to decline in crude oil prices be diverted to the region.""Yesterday, we saw Modiji becoming emotional...he paused during his speech (at BBAU convocation) and had tears in his eyes...I want to say Modiji the food you eat, the pulse which is today selling at Rs 220 is provided to you by farmers,"" he said.""I would ask Modiji to think a little for the farmers, labourers and the poor because they too run the country and it is not only industrialists who do so. So, think about them as well,"" Rahul said.The Congress leader sought more funds for the development of the water-scarce region.""During the UPA regime, price of crude petroleum was USD 150 per barrel, whereas now it has fallen to just USD 28. A lot of money saved here can be used for development of such backward regions like Bundelkhand,"" he said.Rahul, at the same time, said the entire money saved need not be pumped into the region, but at least a portion of it can be utilised.Promising people of Bundelkhand that he would highlight their problems in Parliament, Rahul said he has been speaking on all these issues and voicing concern over farmers' plight during his padyatra in other parts of the country as well.Touching on the major issue of migration from this region, Rahul said had the BJP government at the Centre and SP government in Uttar Pradesh earnestly implemented UPA government's MNREGS programme, the exodus could have been checked.Rahul also congratulated partymen ""for standing alongside the farmers and labourers and fighting for them"".Meanwhile, Rahul, on his arrival at the Khajuraho airport from Delhi en route to Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh, assured party leaders that he will soon tour the Bundelkhand region lying in Madhya Pradesh, according to MP Congress Secretary Nitin Chaturvedi.The party vice president tried to understand the situation prevailing in the region, he said.Party workers briefed Rahul on condition of dalits and tribals in Panna, Tikamgarh, Chhattarpur and Damoh districts.Chaturvedi also said that Rahul has asked them to send a report on the state of affairs in the region to him."

If policymakers were serious about alleviating water shortages for the poor, they would first have to blame themselves for the stupidity, if not depravity, of the policies they have pursued.People are dying  and you want to maintain cricket pitches, asked an over-excited TV anchor. But not as morally excited as the learned justices of the Bombay High Court who opined, as quoted in the media, that this entire thing of the utilisation of water for IPL matches needs to be thought over. The court also apparently asked the BCCI counsel whether cricket matches were more important than people or preserving water. An important question.Watch Video: Discussing The IPL Water ControversyThe first response to this question, especially by immoral thinking economists as well as those with a modicum of common sense, is to ask a related question  what alternative use is there for water, and what is its price? In the desert, water is worth a lot; and it is also worth a considerable amount in drought-prone areas. An average person consumes 150 litres of water per day or 54,000 litres per year. Assume that a sixth of the population of Maharashtra (around 20 million) has no access to any water for half a year  that is, Maharashtra needs to supply (transport) to the drought areas 540 billion litres of water. The IPL matches in Maharashtra are estimated to use six million litres of water for watering the grounds. But that is an estimate of a corrupt capitalist (and therefore, dishonest) BCCI  so let us double the stated amount. So the honourable justices, and the oh-so-moral NGO Loksatta Movement that brought the PIL against IPL, and our learned TV tripping (as in TRP) anchors believe that saving .002 per cent of water will alleviate the water misery of 20 million people. It is not for nothing that my column is called No Proof Required  moving the IPL will only provide water for 400 people for half a year.The Financial Express editorial, IPL vs Sugarcane (April 8) illustrates the utter stupidity of the position that fewer cricket matches in Maharashtra will solve the water shortage problem. If policymakers were serious about alleviating water shortages for the poor, they would first have to blame themselves for the stupidity, if not depravity, of the policies they have pursued. In particular, look at the water-guzzling sugarcane crop. Maharashtra encourages the growing of sugarcane: In 2014-15, the estimated sugar output from Maharashtra was 10 billion kgs. Each kg of sugar uses 2,000 litres of water. In other words, the total water used for sugarcane cropping in the state was 20 trillion litres. You do the math. As the FE editorial hints, the savings from not having the IPL matches are not even a minuscule fraction of the water used by the sugarcane growers in Maharashtra. By creating a moral song and dance about the IPL, the immoral elite only proves to the world that it is intellectually dead.Neither drought nor poverty is new to Maharashtra. First and foremost, the responsibility of delivering the much-needed water to all its citizens (and not just the wealthy) lies with the state administration. What was the BJP in Maharashtra, in particular Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, doing for the past two years? Of course, doing nothing except banning beef and moralising about the need to say Bharat Mata ki Jai everywhere. What could have Fadnavis done? And, given that he has not done it, what can he do now? Basic water needs of humans (150 litres a day) can easily be transported to the drought-hit areas on a daily basis and expenses paid from all the taxes collected by the state. Then what is the problem? And why hasnt this solution been offered, and used as yet?The (non) agricultural policy of the Centre has distorted the food market for decades. The Punjab economy is in a mess because of too much rice production in the state. The Maharashtra economy is in a mess because of the production of too much sugarcane. According to the counsel for the trendsetting Loksatta Movement, the BCCI and the IPL have the means and resources to shift matches out of Maharashtra but the state government does not have the means, and/or the political desire, to transport water to its poor drought-hit citizens?The IPL-versus-water controversy raises a lot of non-sequitur issues, especially the contention that morality has anything to do with it. The need of the hour is to conserve water, and herewith some people who should be honoured for suggesting (moral) rules for water conservation. The top prize goes to Moralist # 1, Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, who has recently banned the sale and consumption of all alcohol (except foreign-made liquor) in Bihar. Note how far-sighted and water-saving this policy is. No beer will be sold, so less toilet water needed for flushing beer-induced piss.Moralist # 2 award goes to the ever- thoughtful and far-sighted Pahlaj Nihalani, the man in charge of the Central Board of Film Certification of India. Sensitive to the IPL-versus-drought conflict, he recently gave a U/A rating to The Jungle Book, a remake of a childrens film. The U/A rating means that children below the age of 12 have to be accompanied by an adult. His reason for the U/A rating (and I am not making this up) was that the 3D effects were too scary for children sitting alone. Note how very subtly Nihalani is helping the water cause. Fewer children screaming means less water is needed to calm them down afterwards, and this saved water can be directed to the Maharashtra farmers via the BCCI headquarters and the Bombay High Court, both of which are located in Mumbai.Herewith are some other Nitish-Nihalani (NN, which can also stand for No and No) type sensible policies to help lessen the need for water, and help farmers and ordinary people in the drought-hit areas of Maharashtra (and elsewhere):Recommended Policy # 1: Stop asking people to say Bharat Mata ki Jai. Think about it  500 million people not saying Bharat Mata ki Jai on a daily basis will save enough water, through reduced thirst, to flood Latur.Recommended Policy # 2 (which is not only recommended but practised in Fadnavis-land): Maharashtrians were asked to have a muted Holi celebration to save water. Of course, if Holi were not a Hindu festival, Holi would have been banned.Recommended Policy # 3: Fadnavis could help the poor citizens of his state, and improve governance if he removed the ban on the slaughter of old cows (above 16 years of age). Water consumption will go down. Although, as a Supreme Court (2005) judgment noted, doing so would mean that manure production will also go down  this was the primary reason why the honourable court banned the killing of all cows.Some questions remain: Why did the honourable court not throw out the morally juvenile petition of Loksatta? And why the argument that the IPL should pay for drought relief? What sense does that make? It is as sensible as placing an environmental tax on the purchase of cricket bats because trees have been felled.

590234187be9e01c1a8de930,Banking on Bharat,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hdfc-bank-rural-bank-semi-urban-bank-banking-on-bharat-2781266/,2016-05-03,"Rural bank lending has historically been driven by regulation through the mandated priority sector lending commitments rather than by a genuine search for business. (Illustration by CR Sasikumar) Rural bank lending has historically been driven by regulation through the mandated priority sector lending commitments rather than by a genuine search for business. (Illustration by CR Sasikumar)Rural households constitute 55-60 per cent of Indias population. The key to Indias prosperity thus lies in increasing the affluence of this so-called Bharat. Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have long recognised the potential of this market and the penetration rates of some of their products like hair oil, shampoos and beverages, just to take a few examples, is close to saturation. Yet, the financial sector in this vast rural economy is still dominated by the unorganised segment. Rural bank lending has historically been driven by regulation through the mandated priority sector lending commitments rather than by a genuine search for business. Its still a very underpenetrated market.Rural markets are highly dispersed and fragmented across villages and semi-urban pockets. The lack of infrastructure, such as roads and electricity, has been a problem. The need to create small-ticket offerings to cater to this market has meant that traditional business models have proved unviable. However, this has been changing rapidly and some banks have taken the lead in adjusting their strategy to exploit this untapped goldmine. Technology, particularly the growing wave of digitisation and the mobile phone revolution, has lent a helping hand as has been the governments push to energise these markets. Thus, from a bankers perspective, Bharat is on a roll  rural financial markets are in the process of taking a quantum leap in the new century.Based on the tremendous market potential, its vital that banks look at these deeper semi-urban and rural geographies to expand their branch network. For a first mover, this would create a long-term advantage for the incumbent, even with subsequent entry by others. A good rural strategy is to provide a complete range of appropriate products for rural customers and replace the moneylender who has traditionally charged crippling rates for the rural poor, perpetuating a vicious cycle of debt.The key to success in these markets is to develop appropriate products for this segment of customers, instead of offering the same products that work in urban markets. Appropriate products and fair lending rates would automatically eliminate the moneylender, as we have seen in our experience. But to achieve this, the entire paradigm of product design, sales and collection would have to be turned on its head.A couple of examples of appropriate products would help underscore the point. For wheat farmers, the time taken between delivering the produce to the agent at the time of grain procurement and his final payment through a cheque or draft typically took 15 to 20 days. With digitisation, this process can be crunched to just 48 hours. The key steps in this dramatic shortening of turnaround time would include the issuance of a smart card to procurement agents, installation of an electronic data machine (EDM) at the mandi backed by the e-payment system RuPay, quick generation of MIS and reports and, finally, e-approvals by the procurement agency.Comparable solutions can enable quick payment to other segments like milk producers, by leveraging the technology of Point of Sale (PoS) terminals for small operations and full-scale ATMs for larger dairy societies. The process enables the instantaneous capture of milk quantity and quality data, converting them into an accounting entry that credits the farmers account, and a micro-ATM or cash dispenser is made available for farmers to draw money from.Similar initiatives can be undertaken for other sectors, such as sugar and fruits and vegetables, with the bank participating at every stage of the supply chain. Banks can offer cash-flow-based working capital and loans to farmers like cattle loans and unsecured personal loans. Back-end systems can capture the entire cash flow and income profile of farmers, to ensure theres no compromise on credit standards. From our experience, for small and medium farmers who were given credit, there was a fivefold increase in savings balances. Thus, an entire culture of savings and banking took root.However, rural banking is not just about providing customised innovations. Theres a large market for an entire suite of products  car loans, two-wheeler loans, tractor loans, light commercial vehicle loans, small working capital loans to traders, personal loans, gold loans, commodity finance, along with the more conventional agricultural credit. Theres also a strong demand for savings products, ranging from basic savings accounts to recurring deposits and life and general insurance products. Of course, ticket sizes are smaller, but break-even thresholds for branches are similar to urban branches as costs are lower.Digitisation of banking has helped access a wider range of customers in rural India. For a rural population that is mobile-enabled to a large extent, digital applications (wallets, mobile-to-mobile payments) are adding to transaction traffic by leaps and bounds. This segment is growing at twice the rate of urban India, ensuring a growth for banks in these geographies higher than market growth for the next decade.This is not to deny that challenges remain in growing the rural markets. Financial literacy is low and incomes and livelihoods are volatile.Any credit disbursal at the grassroot level must have a holistic approach. Along with timely credit, its critical to conduct financial literacy and credit counselling programmes, offer skills training to enhance income generation, form self-help groups and fund these groups for income-generating activities. This enables the delivery of viable credit to the rural poor in a sustainable manner and at the same time inculcates saving and banking habits.Extending finance to the rural markets has traditionally been viewed as a social obligation enforced through diktat rather than the lure of profits. Yet, as we have discovered at HDFC Bank by successfully implementing all of these strategies, theres a veritable treasure trove in these markets. All you need is the right mix of technology, business model and outreach through targeted programmes to tap these opportunities. Bharat is rapidly catching up with India, which is a political, economic and social necessity. The fabric of society is changing, consequent to the convergence of media, telecom and computing, leaving us with no option.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: May 3, 2016 12:00 am"

Karunakaran has set a deadline of September 15 to settle the arrears to be paid to the farmers for the sugarcane purchased from them by a Vasudevanallur-based sugar factory in the district.When the agriculturists raised this issue in the monthly farmers grievance redressal meet held at the Collectorate on Friday, the growers complained that the sugar factory administration, which made an assurance in one of the grievance redressal meetings with Collector in chair that the arrears to be paid to the sugarcane growers would be settled within 40 days, had failed to keep its promise.Even though eighty days have lapsed after this promise was made in the presence of the Collector, the factory administration has taken no efforts to pay the whopping sum due to the farmers, who are in a piquant situation. The sugar factory administration should give 15 per cent interest to compensate this delay. A farmer, who has to ensure unhindered education for his children, feed his family and meet unforeseen medical expenses cannot bear with this delay. Hence, the Collector himself should get an assurance from the representative of the sugar factory attending this meeting, said a farmer from Vasudevanallur.Even after the sugar factory representative assured the vociferous farmers that arrears would be cleared at the earliest, the agriculturists were on their feet, demanding Dr. Karunakaran to directly get the assurance from him.Collector himself should get the assurance from the representative as were not prepared to believe his words anymore.When the Collector asked the sugar factory representative to give a tentative deadline, he replied that the entire arrears would be settled by September-end. Refusing to accept it, Dr. Karunakaran told him to inform his bosses that the total arrears to be paid to the farmers for the sugarcane purchased from them should be settled positively by September 15. Only after the representative accepted to it, the farmers allowed the officials to take up other issues listed for the meeting.When the officials gave a power-point presentation on the Centres new Unified Package Insurance Scheme, which has been introduced in 45 districts across the country including Nagapattinam and Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu on a pilot basis, the farmers opposed the Union Governments decision to rope in ICICI Lombard as the insurer in this scheme.If the Central Government proposes to introduce a new scheme for the benefit of farmers, what is the need for making a private insurance company a part of this process? Why should we pay the premium to a private company while the Centre can easily rope in a public sector undertaking in this scheme? said farmer Kasamuthu of Communist Party of India.Farmer P. Velumayil of CPI (Marxist) said the private insurance company, which received the premium for insuring cotton crop in Kuruvikulam union in the district a couple of years ago was yet to release the compensation for the crop loss due to drought. Can anyone guarantee us that what happened to the Kuruvikulam farmers would not happen to farmers of this place even after paying the due premium? The Collector should forward our sentiments to the State and the Central Governments, Mr. Velumayil said.Accepting the farmers apprehensions, Dr. Karunakaran said he could only convey it to the officials concerned as the modalities of this new insurance scheme had already been finalised by the Centre. If you want to insure the crops, you have to pay the premium prescribed in the handbook given to you. Lets hope for the best, the Collector replied.The farmers also wanted the District Central Cooperative Society to release the list of beneficiaries of crop loan waiver announced by the State Government recently.Dr. Karunakaran handed over vegetable seeds for Aadi cultivation, soil test card and the handbook detailing the subsidised loan schemes meant for farmers.District Revenue Officer M.G. Kulandaivel, Assistant Collector (Training) T. Charusree, Deputy Collector (River Linking Land Acquisition) R. Keerthi Priyadharshini and senior officials participated in the meeting."

He should lodge a complaint and produce the documents before the Election Commission, if he is sure of the allegations, Gopalaswamy challenged.After A Manju took charges as the District In-charge Minister, Revanna is losing his hold and popularity in the district. The JD(S) is afraid of Zilla and Taluk Panchayat elections and thus the leaders are making baseless allegations against the Congress and its leaders. During the MLC election, Revanna himself had distributed money in Alur to his party workers, he alleged.Sugar factoryGopalaswamy listed out various irregularities in the Chamundeshwari Sugar Factory. The factory, under private management, has failed to follow the norms laid out by the government. Though the factory was handed over to the company on lease when Kumaraswamy was chief minister, the factory has not paid the money as per the agreement till date, he said.The authorities have not paid Rs 5 crore to the government as per the agreement. The factory needs no administrative council but, an administrative officer. The administrative council will favour only a section of the people. Even though there was a single tender, the sugar factory was handed over to the company. I will release the documents to prove the irregularities, soon, said Gopalaswamy."

The only time to mend them is during the run up to the elections. If farmers protest, the representatives may take some measures in the interest of the agrarian community, at least for the fear of losing the polls.He warned of staging a protest in front of the houses of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and District In-charge Minister V Srinivas Prasad, if the sugar factories fail to pay a fair and remunerative price (FRP) before February 10.Shanthakumar said, When the farmers laid siege to Bannari Amman Sugar Factory on January 12, the management had promised the District Administration, in writing, to settle the amount (Rs 2,469 per tonne) within two weeks. However, the management has failed to keep its promise and the District Administration is yet to initiate action.Both, the elected representatives and the District Administration, should interfere and take measures to settle the amount at the earliest, he added.He also appealed to the Centre to divert the resources generated from gold deposit scheme for the benefit of farmers. Also, the recently launched crop insurance scheme for farmers should cover all the crops, he added."

Now, they have plans to increase the power generation to 30 mega watt using coal.The agitators alleged that the factory has neglected waste management and that the factory has been discharging effluents into the river.

The institute should create a healthy atmosphere for researchers and its employees.There is a dispute between the CFTRI authorities and its Kannada-speaking employees.The MP said, the office that housed the Kannada Sangha has been closed down after the issue. The issue has been brought to the notice of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and union ministers. If the issue is not solved amicably, Director Ram Rajasekharan should take the responsibility for the wrath of Kannadigas. The CFTRI was doing good, but, in recent days, its activities have come down. The scientists should come up with innovative works, he said.Speaking about chia and quinoa foodgrain introduced by the CFTRI, the MP asked the authorities to ensure a sustainable price and market before promoting them. Taking the example of vanilla, he said, a large number of farmers cultivated vanilla crop, but, finally ended up with debt due to unsustainable market. So, such products should not push farmers into a debt trap, he said.Erappa, a farmer from H D Kote, who was present in the programme said, chia is a good supplement crop for sugar cane or ragi and gives good profit compared to other crops. I have been cultivating chia on two acres of land and I am getting good yield, since two years. This time, I have sold it for Rs 24,000 a quintal. These are short-term crops while sugar cane needs more than a year, he said. Raita Mitra Farmers Producing Society, in Mysuru, buys the products.Speaking on the occasion authorities of Raita Mitra said, the crops were suitable to be grown in Mandya, Ramanagar, Periyapatna and other places. As they belong to tulasi family, no cattle consumes it and is also easy to maintain, they said. The authorities urged the CFTRI to instal a processing unit at Mysuru campus. At present, the products are sent to Hyderabad and other states for processing. The farmers also gifted chia and quinoa to Union Minister Harsh Vardhan."

It was former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa, who had infused a new lease of life by granting Rs 40 to 50 crore towards its revival. Now, the chief minister Siddaramaiah has sanctioned only Rs six crore to pay the salaries of the employees, he said.Sugar cane contributes Rs 16,350 crore towards states economy and it is not a big deal for government to sanction funds to make the factories stable.He suggested the government to lease the factories to private parties or to revamp them for the welfare of cane growers.He also criticised the governments anti-farmer policies, which had affected the cane growers of the region, and said the ministers had failed miserably in reviving the sugar factories.Stressing on acquisition of lands by the government in the name of development, he said, The government should take lands from the farmers through consent and not acquire them. The government is treating farmers as slaves.When government is not capable of managing factories then, what else can they (farmers) give for the state? he asked.Puttanaiah said, Ministers should have common and human sense. Even though hundreds of farmers committed suicide, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have failed to address farmers woes.The MLA urged all party leaders to keep politics aside and to work for the development of the sugar factories."

It seems that the faction politics is here to stay.Caught between the two factions, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has burdened D K Shivakumar with the additional responsibility of Mandya, while he is already the district minister of Ramanagar.Besides, managing factionalism, Energy Minister Shivakumar has several issues before him including that of MySugar factory.High drama was witnessed in the district when it was presumed that Ambareesh would be dropped from the ministry. Three of his supporters had attempted suicide and protests were staged across the district. The supporters continue to hold protests even after a week of the cabinet rejig, hoping that he would be reinstated.The supporters of Ramya have been demanding a berth for her in the ministry.In fact, Shivakumar himself was witness to the factionalism in Congress, when he was made in-charge of the Lok Sabha elections. With his name being recommended for the KPCC presidents post, it is a great challenge for him to put an end to all groupism and strengthen the party.The district has been declared drought-hit since three years and more than 100 farmers have ended their lives in the last one year or so. Mounting debts and crop failures have combined steered the farmers into crisis. The government has to release special financial package to mitigate agrarian crisis.The factories are not paying fair remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane leaving the cane growers in trouble. The crime rate in the district is on the rise. Sand issue and illegal quarrying has gone out of control.The people of the district are wondering whether Shivakumar will be able to manage the politically volatile Mandya and Ramanagar districts, apart from the Energy portfolio."

Though it is tough to get a new policy, it is possible through concerted movement.He urged the state government to strengthen the Lokayukta and said, the institution should not be weakened. As corruption is rampant in the society, let Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) work in tandem with Lokayukta. Every government office should have an ACB unit in it, he said.On reservation, Doreswamy said that reservation was provided for the uplift of deprived and backward classes. The government should analyse the benefits of reservation among the people to make it more effective. People who have enjoyed the fruits of reservation should provide opportunities for others, he said.Doreswamy said that todays youths have no proper guidance and are least bothered about the nation. Parents believe that their children are employable only if they are educated in English medium. The parents should understand the importance and significance of Kannada language. Both parents and government hold equal responsibility to protect the language, he said.Do not drop agitationDoreswamy called upon the farmers not to drop the agitation for safeguarding Mysore Sugar factory.Dont bother about peoples representatives, if they are reluctant to save the factory.

The pending bills for cane supplied amounting up to Rs 222 crore and the reluctance on the part of sugar factories to pay the price fixed by Centre for a tonne of sugar cane, has left the district farmers with a bitter taste.The Centre had fixed the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of Rs 2,300 per tonne of sugar cane supplied by the farmer to factories. But, the factories have failed to abide by the directions, including Bannari Amman factory in Mysuru district. MySugar factory, which is the lifeline of farmers of Mandya had failed to start operations this year. Hence, the sugar cane supplied by farmers in the region had to be diverted to Bannari Amman.According to sources, the district has produced 27.9 lakh metric tonnes of sugar cane.

But, the farmers, led by Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, have staged several protests demanding FRP for their produce.Meetings presided over by Deputy Commissioner Ajay Nagabushan to resolve the issue between farmers and factory owners have failed to arrive on a consensus. Finally, tahsildars raided NSL Sugars at Maddur, Chamundeshwari, Coromandel factories and seized stocks of sugar.However, Nagabushan had said that with the increase in sugar prices, the NSL and Coromandel sugar factories had agreed to pay FRP to the cane supplied by the farmers.

But, this year, the total scenario has changed, due to the delay in pre-monsoon showers.This has left the farmers worried. However, their hopes are kept alive as the officials of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) have predicted good rains in a few days.Speaking to Deccan Herald, a farmer said that the pre-monsoon showers were necessary to sustain standing crops. As there is a delay in pre-monsoon rains this year, we may lose the yield. Every year, the district receives good rains in the months of April and May, facilitating agricultural activities. But, this year, there have been only sparse rains so far, he lamented.According to statistics, the district should have received 46.4 mm of rains in April with an average of 49.7 mm of rains. In 2015, there was 54.7 mm of rains, while it is only 11.4 mm this year. The situation is similar in all the taluks of the district.In the month of May, the average expected rains is 118.7 mm. It was 119.4 mm in 2014 and 156.8 mm in 2015. But, it is only 1.5 mm in 2016 till May 5, which has upset farmers.Crop lossPre-monsoon rains are essential to save sugar cane, coconut and mulberry crops. Sugar cane has already started withering in some villages. In all, sugar cane has been cultivated on 35,000 hectares, coconut on 45,000 hectares, mulberry on 5,000 hectares. The yields are expected to come down, if the rains fail.If there was timely rains in April, the farmers would have sown black-eyed peas (alsande kalu), green gram, sesame and black gram. Now, the sowing activities has been delayed and farmers are anticipating rains to begin sowing.KRS damWater is released into canals only if there was sufficient water in the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) dam.

Describing it as a first-of-its-kind medical feat in India, the Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital said the patient had been critical and in extreme pain. He is now recovering, and the hospital believes its work will go into the record books. The surgery was performed by Dr Jeevan Kankaria, under the guidance of Dr R K Jenaw and with the assistance of Dr Mahendra.For 46-year-old Vinod, who was unaware of his stony gallbladder, the operation was no less than a miracle. A resident of Balakpur in Mathura, he was suffering from abdominal pain for the past one year. When the pain aggravated, Vinod would take painkillers. Finally, a CT scan revealed that he had a swelling in his gallbladder, and he decided to approach the Sawai Man Singh Hospital.Dr Kankaria, associate professor, department of general and laparoscopic surgery, told DH, Around mid-November, when the patient consulted us, we advised him medical tests, which revealed the presence of multiple stones in his gallbladder. He was also diabetic. We got him admitted and waited for his blood sugar level to stabilise.Though Dr Kankaria is a two-time Guinness Book record holder in laparoscopic surgery, operating Vinod was not a cakewalk. Vinods gallbladder was two times the size of a normal gallbladder, and filled with gallstones sans any bile. For cosmetic reasons, a laparoscopy was performed, making only a 1.2 cm incision, which took around an hour. The size of the stones varied from 3.5 mm to 1.5 mm.

The BJP, along with sugar cane growers, will stage a protest in front of the Deputy Commissioners office. As the factory did not start crushing the cane, 12,000 farmers and their family members are affected. The government should pay Rs 3,000 per tonne of sugar cane to farmers, he demanded.Ravindra said, farmers and people were suffering due to scarcity of water, following drought, but the State government was busy, playing with the lives of farmers in the name of modernisation of canals. The government should pay a compensation of Rs 30,000 to farmers per acer of farmland, he demanded. BJP leaders H Honappa, K S Mallikarjun, T S Vivek and Krishna were present.Memorandum to DCMembers of Mysore Sakkare Karkane Kabbu Oppigedarara Sangha, on Monday, warned of taking out a semi-naked bike rally on May 10, if MySugar fails to pay sugar cane transportation charges to the growers.After submitting a memorandum to the deputy commissioner, sangha president S Krishna said, the factory had agreed to procure 7,74,450 tonnes of sugar cane from growers. But as the factory has not started crushing sugar cane, many growers are transporting their produce to other factories.Till now, growers have transported 2,88,758 tonnes of sugar cane to other factories. But no factory pays transportation charges. So, the growers are suffering loss as they are selling sugar cane at Rs 1,200 per tonne. Hence, the MySugar should pay Rs 1,000 as compensation per tonne of sugar cane, Krishna demanded.The state government had released Rs 201.97 crore for the development of MySugar between 2008 and 2012. But, there has been no progress due to various irregularities. The government should conduct an inquiry through Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the irregularities, he said.Krishna said, the sangha members, along with sugar cane growers, would take out the bike rally and stage a protest in front of Chief Minister Siddaramaiahs house in Bengaluru."

However, there is no problem for drinking water.The maximum level of KRS dam is 124.80 ft. Now, the water level has dipped to 82 feet, giving sleepless nights to the farmers in the region, who are dependent on the dam. The water level was 95 feet in the month of April, last year.According to sources, 12 TMC ft of water is available now, out of which 4.45 TMC ft is dead storage. That is, water goes below 65 feet and cannot be drawn. About 5 TMC feet is reserved for drinking water supply to Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya and other places, up to June.Cauvery Neeravari Nigam has stopped releasing water to canals from March 25 itself and there is no possibility of resuming it till July end. Meanwhile, making use of the situation, repair works on a few canals have been started.According to sources, sugar cane has been cultivated on 35,000 hectares in the district. Sugar cane is an annual crop and there is a need to protect it up to July end. Similarly, coconut is grown on 30,000 acres.Fifty per cent of it is inSrirangapatna, Pandavapura, Mandya, Maddur and surrounding areas. Mulberry is grown on 10,000 acres, out of which only a few are dependent on borewells, others are irrigated lands.With the water being stopped in the canals, farmers growing sugar cane, coconut and others are a worried lot. Some have availed loans to dig borewells while others have left it to fate.All the seven taluks in the district have been declared drought-hit by the government. The underground water table is depleting rapidly and the farmers are forced to dig new borewells to save their crops.Speaking to Deccan Herald, K Rudresh, Deputy Director for Horticultural said, though water shortage does not affect coconut crops immediately, it would have an impact on the yield in the future.Shambunahalli Suresh, farmer leader, said, the situation was turning worse with each passing day.It has become a big challenge for the farmers to save their crops. So, the government should stand by the farmers at this juncture and provide suitable compensation for the crop loss, he urged."

But, it has neglected the farmers of other districts, he said.Shanthakumar said that in spite of sugar price reaching Rs 4,000 per quintal, Bannari Amman sugar factory was procuring sugar cane from farmers for a low price.Sugar factories have not shared additional profit among farmers and are looting growers. The association has submitted a memorandum to the government seeking it to fix a price of Rs 3,000 per tonne of sugar cane. Despite repeated protests and requests, the government and minister have failed to take measures to address farmers demand, he said.Shanthakumar urged the government to waive Rs 9,500 crore borrowed by farmers through cooperative societies and demanded a special package for farmers of Kabini dam command area as they have suffered crop loss due to drought. He said scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had badly affected farmers and poor people.The ban on currency notes to root out black money is a good move but Prime Minister Narendra Modi should have taken precautionary measures, he said.Shanthakumar said the agriculture sector had suffered 40% loss due to the ban of notes.

The production and transportation cost of sugarcane has also increased. But, the state government has fixed a lower purchase price, Rs 1,700, this year. It has not kept its words of announcing the FRP at Rs 2,300. In Uttar Pradesh, the government has fixed FRP of Rs 3,150 for 8.5 sugar recovery rate, the price is Rs 3,200 in Haryana, but the Karnataka government is dilly dallying to fix even Rs 3,000 for a higher recovery rate of 9.5, they said.The protestors insisted that they will not withdraw the demonstration until the minister personally lends a ear to their grievances and issues some concrete assurances.

The taluk-level food inspectors should create awareness on salt, besides regularly sending samples of other commodities like sugar and oil for test at district laboratory and also Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) in Mysuru.He categorically instructed the officers to ensure regular supply of essential commodities to the poor and disabled card holders without any inconvenience. Measures should be taken to bifurcate ration shops that are overcrowded with card holders, who trod several distance only to obtain the articles. Each should cater to maximum of 500 to 600 card holders, he added."

It has been demonstrated that a farmer tapping 15 coconut palms for Kalparasa could earn a net profit of Rs 45,000 a month on an average, while a tapper can earn about Rs 20,000 per month.To a query on value addition of arecanut, he said that several value added technologies are available for utilisation of arecanut by-products, such as eco-friendly disposable plates and bowls from areca leaf sheath, fodder from the leaf sheath, oyster mushroom production from leaf and bunch wastes and vermicomposting. It is also noteworthy that about 1.8 tonne dry leaf sheath waste can be produced from one hectare and the micro-enterprise venture for production of arecanut leaf sheath plates and cups accrue income of Rs 27,000/ha.There is, however, a need for skill development and capacity building for women SHGs and rural youth for efficient by-product utilisation in arecanut by various means to ensure value addition and income generation, he added.Clean, green environmentReferring to the contributions of CPCRI towards maintaining a clean and green environment, Dr Chowdappa said that recycling of crop wastes in coconut and arecanut through vermicomposting helps in disposing of wastes, improving soil fertility, reduction in use of chemical fertilisers and sustaining the yield.Coconut gardens of one-hectare area can generate up to 8 tonnes of leaf biomass residues every year. Technology has been developed to utilise these wastes for production of mushrooms and vermicompost and these wastes could produce 1,660 kg of fresh mushroom, which can give a net income of more than Rs 50,000 per year, he said.Similarly, arecanut and cocoa gardens generate biomass of 12 and 8.5 tonnes a hectare respectively and these wastes could be effectively utilised for production of vermicompost, oyster mushroom and as livestock feed. A net income of about Rs 30,000 could be generated through vermicompost production from wastes of one hectare arecanut garden. The arecanut leaf sheath and bunch waste can result in production of 643 kg fresh mushroom with a net income of about Rs 30,000, the director explained.Speaking on the efforts of CPCRI in management of diseases, he said root (wilt), bud rot, basal stem rot and stem bleeding of coconut, fruit rot and yellow leaf disease of arecanut, and black pod and stem canker in cocoa are major diseases that cause substantial crop losses.Integrated disease management strategies developed for root (wilt) and leaf rot affected coconut gardens could increase yield by 25-83 per cent depending on severity of the disease, he said.Optimising resourcesOne of the highlights of CPCRI is optimising resources to maximise profit. Coconut or arecanut-based inter/mixed, multi-storied, multi-species cropping as well as mixed farming systems have been developed by integrating livestock to increase total productivity.The coconut based cropping system using multi species cropping of coconut with pepper, banana, nutmeg, pineapple, ginger, turmeric and elephant foot yam generated a net income of Rs 3.7 lakh per ha, which is 150 per cent higher than that of coconut monocrop (Rs 1.4 lakh), while the coconut-based mixed farming system (CMFS) comprising coconut, pepper, banana, cross bred cows, poultry birds, goat, and pisciculture generated a net return of Rs 5.5 lakh, which is 288 per cent higher than that of coconut monocrop, he informed.Areca-based cropping system with cocoa, banana and black pepper as component crops generated net returns as high as Rs 8.8 lakh per ha, which is 132 per cent higher than that of arecanut monocrop (Rs 3.80 lakh). On the other hand, cropping systems like arecanut plus vanilla, arecanut plus medicinal and aromatic plants, and arecanut plus cocoa have generated 68%, 53%, and 26% higher net returns respectively over arecanut monocrop. Arecanut-based mixed farming system (AMFS) with dairying, freshwater aquaculture and fodder grass (Hybrid Napier) components generated net returns up to Rs 6.6 lakhs per ha, which is 74 per cent higher than that of arecanut monocrop, he said.In addition to the economic benefits, the systems provide food and nutritional security and sustainability, Dr Chowdappa stressed."

No poor man wants to bequeath poverty to his children. I have always tried to work for the common man,"" he said.Development, he said, was the solution to all problems and all other talk was meant to win elections and cater to vote bank politics.With the NDA dispensation facing criticism over alleged intolerance, Modi said his government's ""conscience was clear"" and it wanted to develop all sections of society.Citing Swachh Bharat initiative, Mudra loan scheme, Prime Minister crop insurance scheme, free LPG connections to poor and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign, he said these programmes were meant to serve everybody, irrespective of caste and religion, while schemes launched earlier were made keeping in mind castes and vote banks.Without naming the UPA government, he attacked it over alleged corruption and flagged his government's ""honest"" credentials.""How much money was looted. Now I am in government and I am shocked over it as whether people are given chair to loot public money. I had pledged to stop this.""I want to ask you have you ever heard any news that the Modi government had pocketed money? Have even our rivals levelled such allegations? Two years ago nobody had the courage to give their report card to lakhs of people like this,"" he said.That is why, Modi said, his government was observing 'vikas parv' (festival of development) and all his ministers would travel across the country to give to the people an account of their work.Asserting that India was growing at the fastest rate, Modi said only two years ago many thought the country had ""sunk"".""They would say India has sunk and things cannot change. There was a mood of hopelessness while there is enthusiasm today. Earlier there was a mood of unease, now it is about moving forward,"" he said.Speaking about the ongoing electrification of over 18000 villages, Modi said media highlights any gap in the claims made by his government and added he welcomed criticism. Over 7000 villages have received power and UP had the largest share, he said.Attacking previous governments for making LPG connections a thing for the rich, Modi said his government had distributed it among the 3 crore poor families and 5 crore more will be covered in the next three years. The Prime Minister noted over 1 crore families had given up LPG subsidy at his call.""In the last 60 years, the work for women's empowerment like this has never happened,"" he said noting that health of poor women suffered due to burning of wood as fuel.Claiming his government had shown how the poor can be empowered, Modi said over Rs 1.25 lakh crore was distributed among 3.25 crore such families under the Mudra loan scheme.He told the gathering that being an MP from UP he was a 'UP-walla' and wanted to seek their blessings as he recalled it was around this time two years ago that his government had taken oath.As the 'Pradhan Sewak', a term he has often used for himself, Modi said he is giving an account of his work to people.Modi said the ratio of divisible resources between Centre and the states earlier was 65:35 which his government changed and now 65 per cent of the share was going to the states. Over Rs 2 lakh crore was given to panchayats, Modi said, underlining his government's ""commitment"" to development of states and villages.When he had taken over the reins, the dues of sugarcane farmers ran up to Rs 14000 crore, which had come down to about Rs 700-800 crore now due to measures taken by his government, Modi said and ""warned"" the sugar mill owners against treating the farmers the way they did in the past.""We have taken a pledge that when the country celebrates 75 years of independence in 2022, we will double the income of farmers through implementation of various policies,"" he said and listed a host of schemes launched for their benefit like soil health card and crop insurance.Modi also called for judicious use of water, saying adequate amount of it will help farmers against all odds. ""I request you to save as much water as you can,"" he said. Modi is expected to address three more rallies in different parts of the country in the coming days."

There was also a decision support software to ease their task.The care coordinators were responsible for following up with intervention patients at least once every 3 months and contacted patients by telephone at least once a month to discuss diabetes self-management, adherence to diet plans, exercise, tobacco cessation, medication use, self-monitoring of glucose levels (if the patient was receiving insulin), and stress management, the researchers reported in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.After 28 months, those who received such extra attention from the care coordinators showed far superior level of sugar control, reducing the risk of heart attacks or kidney problems.Additional manpower would cost money but the long-term benefits outweigh the initial investment. In India, the government programme already has sanctions for such coordinators, Nikhil Tandon, professor of endocrinology at the AIIMS told DH."

Soon, they wont have to transport the agricultural produce stocked in government warehouses to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) yards. For, they can go online to market them directly from the warehouse.Cooperation and Sugar Minister H.S. Mahadeva Prasad announced this after laying the foundation stone for a 15,568-tonne warehouse on the outskirts of Aland town in Kalaburagi district on Friday. He said the online facility will be introduced within a year.Mr. Prasad said at present, there are 139 government warehouses in the State with a storage capacity of 11.21 lakh tonnes. The government has plans to construct another 141 warehouses, with a capacity of 13.83 lakh tonnes, in order to match the annual agriculture production of 33.40 lakh tonnes. A sum of Rs. 800 has been allocated for the purpose, the Minister said. The government has also leased private warehouses to add storage capacity of 1.42 lakh tonnes.One of the added features of the new warehouses is that all will be equipped with solar panels. The department proposes to generate 92 MW of power from the panels and sell it to the respective ESCOMs. The Karnataka Warehousing Corporation will be the first corporation to tap such a large extent of renewable power, Mr. Prasad said.He said that of the 141 new warehouses, 20 per cent will be cold storages. Once all of them are constructed, Karnataka will jump from seventh to third when it comes to storage capacity. In Aland town, the new warehouse is being constructed on five acres of land. A warehouse, with a capacity of 33,000 tonnes, will be constructed at Kotnur, while another, with 8,000 tonnes capacity, will come up at Chincholi.The Minister also said that of the Rs. 2,022 crore that was due to sugarcane growers in the State, only Rs. 158 crore remains to be paid.

5903c8887be9e02646bd7e75,Design thinking for a better you,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/522556/design-thinking-better-you.html,2016-01-11,"Design thinking for a better youTara Parker Pope, Jan 11, 2016, INYT: 23:12 ISTA strategy called design thinking has helped numerous entrepreneurs and engineers develop successful new products and businesses. But can design thinking help you create healthful habits?Dr Bernard Roth, a prominent Stanford engineering professor and a founder of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, says that design thinking can help everyone form the kind of lifelong habits that solve proble-ms, achieve goals and help make our lives better. We are all capable of reinvention, says Roth.Ive applied design thinking to my own life the past few months, and it seems to be working. Ive lost 25 pounds, reconnected with close friends and refocused my energy on specific goals and habits.Design thinking has helped me identify the obstacles that were stopping me from achieving my goals, and its helped me reframe my problems to make them easier to solve. In the words of Roth, design thinking helped me get unstuck.To get started, design thinkers focus on five steps, but the first two are the most important. Step 1 is to empathise  learn what the real issues are that need to be solved. Next, define the problem  a surprisingly tough task. The third step is to ideate  brainstorm, make lists, write down ideas and generate possible solutions. Step 4 is to build a prototype or create a plan. The final step is to test the idea and seek feedback from others.Design thinking is normally applied by people who are trying to create a new product or solve a social problem or meet a consumer need. For instance, Stanford students went to Myanmar to work on an irrigation project. The first two steps of design thinking meant that the students spent time with the farmers to understand their problems with watering crops.In doing so, they discovered that the farmers real problem was not irrigation but light. The farmers used candles or kerosene lanterns, and managing their needs for light without electric power consumed a great deal of time and income.As a result, the design-thinking students used empathy to shift their focus to the actual problem that needed solving. They developed affordable, solar-powered LED task lights.Roth says the same type of thinking that solved the lighting problem for the poor farmers can be applied inward. To start, think about the problem you want to solve. Then ask yourself, What would it do for me if I solved this problem?One example Roth uses is a person who wants to find a life partner. Ask yourself, What would finding a partner or spouse do for me? One answer might be that it would bring you companionship. The next step is to reframe the problem: How can I find companionship?Reframe your problemThere are more and easier answers to the new question  you can meet friends online, take classes, join a club, take a group trip, join a running group, get a pet and spend time at the dog park. By changing the question, I have altered my point of view and dramatically expanded the number of possible solutions, Roth says.For years, I would have told you that my biggest problem was being overweight, but I simply could not find a diet that wo-rked. But design thinking helped me reframe my problem.It happened a few months ago when I declined an invitation to a party with many of my favourite people who I hadnt seen in years. I didnt go because I was embarrassed by my weight, and I just didnt feel up to seeing people who knew me when I was thinner.I realised that my issues with my weight were getting in the way of me living my life. It was time for design thinking. At this point, a design thinker would ask What would losing weight really do for you?The answer surprised me. I wanted to feel better about myself, feel less tired and have more energy and confidence to socia-lise and reconnect with friends. Conducting my own personal empathy exercise helped me realise that weight loss was really not my problem. Instead, I needed to focus on my friendships, on boosting my energy and getting better sleep.And surprisingly, this new, more empathetic approach to my own needs also illuminated some ways to improve my diet. I realised a carb crash around lunchtime was making me very tired during the day, so I eliminated sugar and processed carbohydrates and immediately had more energy. In shifting my focus away from weight loss to the real issues weighing on my life, I ended up losing 25 pounds.I still have a long way to go, but developing empathy for myself was truly a breakthrough. Design thinking on the highest level is a way of reframing the way you look at the world and deal with issues, and the main thing is this idea of empathy, Roth says."
