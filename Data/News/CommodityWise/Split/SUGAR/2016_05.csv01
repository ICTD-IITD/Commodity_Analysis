We will consider that suggestion, the minister said. There could be niche banks and banks which could survive independently and sustain themselves well, he said, observing that the Gyan Sangam strongly supported the idea of consolidation in the banking sector.The other idea which was suggested at the meeting was to reward the public sector bank employees with ESOP, he said.Government is considering (ESOP proposal). It is in a very advanced stage...It has been a long standing demand, and is (under) active consideration, Jaitley said.With regard to the rising non-performing assets or bad loans, Jaitley said that besides strengthening the institutional mechanism, the government has been taking sector specific decisions to deal with the problems in segments like power, highways, sugar and steel.Giving details of the deliberations during the conclave, Jaitley said there are suggestions to amend Sarfaesi Act and also expedite the DRT process by some more amendments to law. The Department of Financial Services is working in that direction and work is in fairly advanced stage, he said, adding that DRT will become the countrys first online court.We are anxiously waiting for report of the Joint Committee on Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law. That will create a structural and institutional mechanism which will help the bank as lenders, said Jaitley. As far as recovery is concerned...Neither loan waiver has been given, nor will be given, the minister added."

The board issued a detailed set of guidelines to replace junk foods with healthy snacks and food varieties, as its previous advisories in this regard had been cold shouldered by a large number of private schools.It also asked the schools to make parents and children aware of the ill effects of junk food.Schools are required to ensure that there are no high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) foods like chips, fried foods, carbonated beverages, ready-to-eat noodles, pizzas, burgers, potato fries and confectionery items, chocolates, candies, samosas and bread pakoras in the school canteens, the CBSE said in a circular.It also advised the schools to conduct inspection of lunch boxes of their students to rule out consumption of unhealthy foods, saying consumption of HFSS food has been found to be associated with many diseases, including type-2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation and hyperinsulinemia with a risk of cardiovascular diseases in later life.These diseases and childhood obesity have been reportedly found to affect the cognitive and physical development of children adversely, causing an irreparable loss to the society, it added, highlighting significance of promoting healthy food eating habits among children.In its circular, the board gave the web link of a recent report of a working group, set up by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, and asked the schools to refer the recommendations for implementation.The recommendations made by the panel comprehensively covers the issue and provides invaluable insights on how to control the endemic problem of consumption of junk food available in and around schools, it addedThe boards directive comes months after the Delhi High Court, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) in March last year, accepted the draft guidelines formulated by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, to restrict sale of HFSS food items in and around schools."
5903f7757be9e02646bda341,New look to PDS changes lives of shopkeepers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/584664/look-pds-changes-lives-shopkeepers.html,2016-12-03,"New look to PDS changes lives of shopkeepersTabeenah Anjum in Jaipur, Dec 04, 2016 0:06 ISTOm Prakash Chaudhry, a physically challenged man from Jaipur rural, has a reason to smile. Despite afflicted by polio, he is now fully occupied at his shop. His low-profile fair price shop (FPS) has received a colourful facelift and has been converted into an Annapurna Bhandaar.Like Om Prakash's shop, 5,050 FPSs have been rebranded as Annapurna Bhandaars, new supermarkets in villages in Rajasthan.Seen as a pioneering initiative in the public distribution system (PDS) to provide quality products in remote areas at cheaper prices, Om Prakash has a monthly turnover of Rs 1.5 lakh and his earnings have more than tripled from Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000.An agreement signed between Rajasthan State Food and Civil Supplies Corporation and Future Consumer Enterprise Ltd has made this possible.With thisagreement,a new era of PPP (private-public participation) model has started in the history of Indias PDS. Annapurna Bhandaar Yojna would strengthen government's effort in bringing about a positive change and bettering the daily lives of the people of Rajasthan, said Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje after the pact was signed.It is believed thatthe biggest entrepreneurship drive would make 5,000 fair price shopkeepers become entrepreneurs with Annapurna Bhandaars. The inspiration for the scheme was a model from a store at Tamatia village in Dungarpur district. During her visit to the shop, she was surprised and impressed to find a ration shop, mini ATM,selling seeds, fertilisers and grocery productsunder a single roof.The agreement aims at providing multi-brand consumer goods at competitive prices to the people. The districts topping the charts are Jalore, Jaisalmer, Dholpur, Jhunjhunu and Pali.According toPrincipal Secretary (food and civil supplies) Subodh Agarwal, theunique model will not only benefit the PDS but also improve supply chain to benefit people in cities, towns and villages. After successfully converting 5,000 ration outlets into modern shops, we are all set to convert the remaining 20,000 shops, he said.Under thescheme, only FPSs with road connectivity and at least 200 sqft space would be converted into Bhandaars. The shops will be provided with an e-mitra and mini ATM in the second phase. Two machines have been installed in Pali and Sumerpur.Did the department have a smooth sail in implementing the Bhandaar scheme. The secretary says no. He called ita willingness-based scheme. The department had to engage shopkeepers in a dialogue and convince them on the benefits that would accrue to them with the changeover. Since socio-economic conditions vary from place to place in Rajasthan, it was hard to convince fair price shopkeepers. Once they agreed, we trained them in modern practices. It has brought about a major change in the lives of shopkeepers. Earlier, they were called dealers but now they have become traders.The PDS was sellingonly a few items. But now these Bhandaars deal in edible oil, ghee, pulses, jaggery, spices, different types of attas such as maida, besan and rava, and pickles, sauces and even personal care products like talcum powder, hair oil, shampoo, creams and other consumer products.Besides supplying quality consumer goods at affordable prices to the FPS, the selling partner Future Group is training dealers in modern techniques and best management retail practices.The idea is to empower rural areas and to generate more employment. Earlier, the FPS would sell only kerosene, sugar and wheat, but Annapurna Bhandaars have over 150 products on their shelves.In the first phase we converted almost 20% of the existing FPS into supermarkets. Rebates are offered on products sold at these shops. The shopkeeper can avail a loan to start his venture under the Prime Minister Mudra scheme for which tie-up has been made with banks,saidPreeti, General Manager, Marketing and Administration, Food and Supplies Corporation, Rajasthan.Earlier,teenagers and youth were reluctant to visit the shop and help their parents because of its profile. But nowthe scene is different.Upgradingmy old shop into Annapurna Bhandaar has brought a new life. Earlier, I used to work for just 5-7 days in a month for public distribution centre and earn Rs 6,000. Now, I open the shop throughout the month and earn Rs 25,000, said Suresh Kumar Sharma, Annapurna Bhandaar owner at Bhambori village on theoutskirtsof Jaipur.His wife Bimla Bai, who helps him, added, Earlier my husband used to sit idle at home after the completion of distribution of items under the PDS. Now he opens his shop 8 am and closes late in the night. He has become active and healthy, she said with a chuckle.Interestingly, a few retail shops had closed down after Bhandaars commenced. The scheme has certainly proved to be a success as many shops selling non-branded and inferior quality products had to down the shutters within months of Bhandaars began working. Most consumers shifted their preferences and started buying packed and branded items which are available at a cheaper rate, Lokesh Chandra, District Coordinator for Annapurna Bhandaar Yojna, said.The Future Group takes back unsold items within the expiry period.According to the Future Group's head for this scheme,Satish Sharma, this is the world's first entrepreneur model which has created a record by giving employment to thousands of people, quality food to consumers in just a few months.We started the scheme with the Rajasthan government by conducting a pilot by testing multi-brand consumer items provided at five shops in Jaipur and one in Udaipur in 2015. After getting positive response, the work started and we achieved the target before time. The group alone has given employment to 2,000 people, including 13 district coordinators, 1,000 employees on payroll and 1,000 others who work as transporters, loaders etc. A total of 13 warehouses store the goods, he said.At least12 states, including Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have visited the districts to study the module and have shown interest in replicating it in their states. The success report has also been sent to Harvard University by the Future Group."

Cane farmers under Punjab Pagri Sambhal Jatta, which is affiliated to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), and Doaba Sangharash Committee have decided to block the National Highway and also stage rail roko on August 29 if the dues were not cleared by August 26.They said that this was their final ultimatum to the government.Representatives of both the farmers organisations and farmers of many parts of Doaba, Majha and Malwa regions met Friday at Phagwara where a large number of cane growers under Phagwara based Wahid-Sandhar Sugar Mill were present. They also submitted a memorandum at the sub-divisional magistrate office, Phagwara.The rate of cane in Punjab was fixed at Rs 295 per quintal by the Punjab government and the 16 sugar mills  nine private and seven co-operative mills  had to pay Rs 245 per quintal to the farmers and remaining Rs 50 was to be paid by the government. Even the government had issued notification pertaining to this on November 23, 2015 and the notification number was 3715.Kamaljit Singh Kaki, president of Pagri Sambhal Jatta, said farmers have received the payment from the mill at the rate of Rs 245 per quintal and reaming Rs 50 per quintal were not cleared by government yet. The government made payments till January month while the cane crushing ended in April and three months pending amount is Rs 226 crore, said he.Kaki also alleged that the government, which had encouraged cane variety-CO 0238- earlier, is now cheating farmers and has decided to crush it in the last while it comes under early varieties and 95 per cent farmers of the state are growing it.If the government does this, every farmer will face loss of Rs 6,000-7,000 per acre, he added. This is Haryana state variety and now government want to discourage this one of the best varieties, said another farmer Kuldip Singh, the member of Doaba Sangharsh Committee, adding that Rs 17.92 crore of Phagwara mill cane growers is laying pending towards government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It is estimated that this figure will cross 10 crore mark by 2030, the Health Minister said.""In view of the above, I request for your personal intervention in the matter so that the option of 'Diabetic Diet' is available while booking tickets for journey by trains,"" Nadda said.Current estimates peg the number of diabetics in the country at about 62 million  an increase of over 10 million from 2011, according to reports.Diabetic patients are advised to choose high-fiber, slow-release carbohydrates in their diet. Carbohydrates have a big impact on the person's blood sugar levels.Nadda has been vocal about the issue since he was a Rajya Sabha MP from Himachal Pradesh. Back in 2013, he had written to the then railway minister Pawan Kumar Bansal seeking provision of special meals for travellers suffering from diabetes or cardio-vascular disease (CVD).He raised the issue through a question in the Rajya Sabha in August.Presently, passengers while travelling on trains having catering services are provided with options of a non-vegetarian or a vegetarian meal.With over 60 million Indians being affected by diabetes, the Indian Medical Association had earlier said the need of the hour is to reduce consumption of high-trans fat and sugar laden products.They had also appealed to the present government to consider implementing a sugar taxation policy like the one in Mexico."
590410867be9e02646bdb6f6,Mixed fortunes of weight loss surgery,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/589128/mixed-fortunes-weight-loss-surgery.html,2016-12-30,"Gina Kolata, Dec 31, 2016, International New York Times 23:14 ISTThe operation causes changes in patients' physiology, altering activity of thousands of genes in the bodyIt was October 11, 2015. A middle-aged man and a young woman, both severely obese, were struggling with the same feeling. The next day they were going to have an irreversible operation. Were they on the threshold of a new beginning or a terrible mistake?They were strangers, scheduled for back-to-back bariatric surgery at University of Michigan with the same doctor. He would cut away most of their stomachs and reroute their small intestines. They were almost certain to lose much of their excess weight. But their doctor told them it was unlikely they would ever be thin.Nearly 2,00,000 Americans have bariatric surgery each year. Yet far more  an estimated 24 million  are heavy enough to qualify for the operation, and many of them are struggling with whether to have such a radical treatment, the only one that leads to lasting weight loss for virtually everyone who has it.Most people believe that the operation simply forces people to eat less by making their stomachs smaller, but scientists have discovered that it causes profound changes in patients physiology, altering the activity of thousands of genes in the human body as well as the complex hormonal signalling from the gut to the brain. It often leads to changes in the way things taste, making cravings vanish. Those who have the surgery naturally settle at a lower weight.Over the last year, I followed Keith Oleszkowicz and Jessica Shapiro  a computer programmer and a college student  from their surgeries through the transformations that followed. Jessica, 22, lived with her mother and grandmother in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and worked at Panera Bread preparing food. At 5-foot-3 and 295 pounds, she had a difficult life. She needed a seat belt extender on airplanes.She had acid reflux and mild sleep apnea. Even worse were struggles of being fat. She never had a date and no man seemed interested in her. She tried programmes like Weight Watchers, but her urge to eat defeated her. Keith was 40, married with a teenage son, and worked as a programmer at an automaker. His older brother had had the surgery, too, 16 years ago, when many doctors were splitting patients open instead of doing surgery laparoscopically. The complication rate was much higher then.The one-year mortality rate today is 0.1%, safer than gallbladder surgery or joint replacement. Keith, at 5-foot-9 and 377 pounds, was having physical and medical problems: his joints hurt; he could not bend down to tie his shoes; he had sleep apnea; he had high blood pressure.By the day of their surgeries, Jessica and Keith had spent months preparing. They learned that the gastric bypass operation both had chosen leaves patients unable to absorb some vitamins and minerals. They would need to take supplements daily forever. And because the rearranged digestive tracts can dump sugar into the bloodstream too quickly, they would have to be careful about sugar intake.The surgeon, Dr Oliver Varban, started by inflating Jessicas abdomen with carbon dioxide to give him more room to work. Then he made seven small holes in her skin and inserted his equipment, including a cylindrical tube containing a tiny light to illuminate her abdominal cavity, lenses, mirrors and a tiny camera to project the scene on a computer monitor above Jessicas head. It showed gleaming golden bubbles of fat.Varban used what looked like a miniature table tennis paddle to push Jessicas liver aside and give him a clear view of her stomach. It might seem reasonable for Varban to remove some fat from Jessicas abdomen, but doing that, he said, would result in a bloody, hemorrhaging mess. He said there is a mile of blood vessels in every pound of fat.Varban cut off most of Jessicas pink and healthy stomach, leaving a pouch the size of an egg. He stapled and sealed the pouch with a device that looked like a saw-toothed pair of shears, leaving a shiny metallic edge of staples. Then he grabbed the top of her small intestine and attached it to the stomach pouch. Jessica was surprised by the pain. I was like, What did I do to my body? This is not reversible, there is no going back, she said.For obesity experts, bariatric surgery is at best a compromise. What they really want is medical treatment with same effect  lowering the bodys set point, the weight it naturally settles into  without drastically altering the persons digestive tract. Bariatric surgery changes the entire setting of a complex, interlocking system. There is no one place to tweak it. To show what is involved, reports that surgery immediately alters the activity of more than 5,000 of the 22,000 genes in the human body.You have to think of it as a whole network of activity, said Dr Lee Kaplan, obesity researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. Its a network that responds to the environment as well as genes, he added. Todays environment probably pushed that network into a state that increased the set point for many people: Their brains insist on a certain amount of body fat and resist diets meant to bring them to a lower weight.Intestinal tractBut surgery only alters the intestinal tract. That tells you, Kaplan says, that there are whole classes of signals coming from the gut and going to the brain and that they interact to control hunger, satiety, how quickly calories are burned and how much fat is on the body. For bariatric surgery to work, the setting in the brain that determines how much fat a person will have  what Kaplan refers to as the bodys thermostat for fat  must have been set too high, not broken.A few rare genetic mutations break the thermostat. People with those mutations have no internal controls on their fat and grow enormously obese. Bariatric surgery has no effect on them. People like Jessica and Keith, whose thermostats were mis-set, reach a point at which they are obese but their weight holds steady without any effort on their part. Surgery can lower their thermostats setting.That simplistic notion  that there may be just a few key places to intervene in the tangled web of controls that sets a persons weight  seems just that: simplistic. But some nodes of the network may be more important than others. They may be the drivers. What we need to do is find these mechanisms, Kaplan said.A year after his surgery, Keith weighed 284 pounds, down from his starting weight of 377, but not at projected weight of 230. It is increasingly unlikely that he will get there. But he looked and felt transformed. Some people I havent seen in years dont recognise me, he said.Jessica lost 112 pounds, about what was predicted. She began classes at Eastern Michigan University in the fall but dropped out in October, as she did not like the courses and had lot of anxiety. Before operation, she could blame her stalled life on obesity. Now, she says, I dont have an excuse. She wants to lose 40 pounds more. Although she has mixed feelings about the surgery results and though she is disappointed her life hasnt changed as much as she hoped, she said she doesnt regret having the operation."
59041a807be9e02646bdbed2,"Timely screening, key step to diabetes care",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/581098/timely-screening-key-step-diabetes.html,2016-11-14,"Timely screening, key step to diabetes careNitin Sawant, Nov 15, 2016 23:32 ISTTwo decades ago, as the International Diabetes Federation and World Health Organisation came together to observe World Diabetes Day (WDD-Nov 14) in response to growing concerns about the health threats posed by diabetes, none of us would have imagined, that India will soon become the diabetes capital of the world.Results indicate that in India, deaths due to diabetes have increased by 50% between 2005 and 2015 and diabetes is the seventh most common cause of death in the country. With as many as 50 million people suffering from type 2 diabetes (diabetes mellitus), India has more people living with the disease than any other country.If left untreated, it can result in health complications like heart disease, stroke, kidney disorders, neuropathy or nerve da-mage leading to leg amputation and even blindness. This is also adding stress to Indian healthcare system and economy.It is significant to note that recognising the importance of early screening and regular monitoring of type 2 diabetes, resulting in a better management of the disease, the International Federation of Diabetes declared eyes on diabetes as the central theme of WDD 2016. Across the world, one in two with diabetes cases is undiagnosed. However, studies indicate that up to 70% of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed by adopting healthier lifestyles.Keeping in mind the urgent need to develop technologies which can enhance early diagnosis of diabetes, many healthcare technology companies have come to the forefront to provide low-cost, portable, point-of-care devices to the Indian masses.The strategic intent is to initially deliver these services in major hospitals and gradually expand its reach to the common man by equipping the primary healthcare centres and neighbourhood clinics in the rural pockets with the state-of-the-art technology.Innovative laboratory equipment which can provide accurate and fast reports to detect and monitor diabetes if made more accessible to the common man can help clinicians to classify the medical conditions of a patient into separate and distinct categories. This will accelerate the process of deciding the treatment and prognosis.One of these instruments currently brought into the market by leading medical device manufacturers is, advanced clinical electrophoresis analyser  a device which processes large portions of samples such as blood, serum, plasma, and urine.A highly proficient instrument which can be used in all types of laboratories, from small point-of-care clinics to high-throughput clinical labs, it can efficiently detect and monitor diabetes. Laboratories are also equipped with comprehensive test menus for diabetes, pancreatitis, cardiac, renal panel etc.Many people live with type 2 diabetes for a long period of time without being aware of their condition. By the time of diagnosis, diabetes complications may already be present. However, such innovative lab instruments can help in premature diagnosis and effective monitoring of several medical complications.Blood sugar levelsOne of the latest diagnostic diabetes tools most nations have gradually started adopting as a supplement to the existing blood glucose test is HbA1c whi-ch is measured primarily to ide-ntify the three-month average plasma glucose concentration.HbA1c develops when haemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body, joins with glucose in the blood, becoming glycated. By measuring glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), clinicians are able to get an overall picture of what the average blood sugar levels have been over a period of weeks/months.For people with diabetes, this is important as the higher the HbA1c, the greater the risk of developing diabetes-related complications. Industry has come up with up-to-the minute technology for a fast and optimal HbA1c measurement, for instance the Capillarys 2 Flex-piercing instrument.The HbA1c test is currently one of the best ways to see if diabetes is under control. It is not affected by short-term fluctuations in blood glucose concentrations, say, due to meals; blood can be drawn for HbA1c testing without regard to when food was eaten. Fasting for the blood test is not necessary.An important part of managing diabetes as well as ones overall health is maintaining a healthy weight through a healthy diet and indulging in good physical activities. Patient resistance and reluctance to admit diabetes can affect anybody irrespective of age or gender lead to a constant delay in receiving timely diagnosis of diabetes. However, with the right use of the latest technology, diabetes can be tackled much better with appropriate screening and early initiation of treatment.(The writer is Senior Vice President, Trivitron Healthcare)"

A big banner outside a super bazaar caught my eye. Fabulous offer! 25% discount on rice, wheat and sugar! it read.I was intrigued. In this day and age when expenses are swirling like smoke from a heap of garbage set afire, the screaming banner appeared to be manna from heaven.I strode into the shop purposefully and asked for details. The offer was on 25kg wheat and rice bags and 10kg sugar bag. As I wasnt planning to open an eatery or to cater to a wedding party, I retreated, quite disappointed. A 5% discount on a kg would have helped, I thought ruefully.Flippancy aside, space is a constraint and storage poses a problem. And with the passing of time and the growth of technology, we have become soft. Even lifting not-so-heavy weights leads to aches and pains. This, in turn, entails medical expense, loss of time and a drop in productivity. Most of us prefer small packs even if it is at extra cost.Recently, I received a sipper with a ready-mix pack. I refused the free gift because the baby of the family is a sturdy, twenty one year-old! With a packet of jelly, I was offered a mould free. I wasnt impressed and took just the jelly. That the mould was horrendous in colour didnt endear it to buyers!Another time, when I picked up a bottle of Nescafe, the shop assistant favoured me with a shaker that accompanied it. I pretended to forget it and left it behind.The alert shop assistant came after me with it. I told him I didnt want it. He extolled its usefulness, right there in the middle of the busy road.Dodging traffic and dealing with the persistent shop assistant was, to say the least, a difficult task. Wanting to avoid drawing attention of passers-by, I took the wretched thing and stuffed it into my shopping bag.A similar experience awaited me when I picked up a box of cereal. Here is a bowl for you! said the fresh-faced, bright-eyed youngster who attended to me. It was done with the air of a conjuror! Meekly, I accepted the plastic eye-sore, even thanking him, as I didnt want to be subjected to another sales-pitch barrage!Needless to say, I discarded it, followed by the sipper, the shaker and the mould, though I am not sure if it was strictly in that order."

Everything else, however severe, is considered the price worth payingAs Chuck Peal lay in a Waterbury, Connecticut, emergency room one Sunday in early September, doctors furiously tried to make sense of his symptoms. Peal, 61, appeared to be dying and they were not sure why. He slipped in and out of consciousness, his blood pressure plummeted, his potassium levels soared and his blood sugar spiked to 10 times the normal level. A doctor suspected a heart attack, but uncertainty left him urgently researching the situation on his phone.This was not a heart attack. Peals body was attacking itself, a severe reaction by his immune system that was a side effect of a seemingly miraculous cancer treatment aimed at saving his life. In the seven weeks prior, doctors at Yale University had combated Peals melanoma with two of the most promising drugs in cancer treatment today. These medicines work by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer as ferociously as it does other threats.Immunotherapy drugs have been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer treatment, attracting billions of research dollars and offering new hope to patients out of options. But as their use grows, doctors are finding that they pose serious risks that stem from the very thing that makes them effective. An unleashed immune system can attack healthy, vital organs.Doctors at Yale believe immunotherapy is causing a new type of acute-onset diabetes, with at least 17 cases there so far, Peals among them. In cancer clinics around the world, and in drug trials, myriad other side effects are showing up. Studies are finding that severe reactions occur nearly 20% of the time with certain drugs, and in more than half of patients when some drugs are used in combination.Another paper found that 30% of patients experienced interesting, rare or unexpected side effects, with a quarter of reactions described as severe, life-threatening or requiring hospitalisation. Some patients have died, including five in recent months in clinical trials of a new immunotherapy drug being tested by Juno Therapeutics Inc. The upshot, oncologists and immunologists say, is that the medical field must be vigilant as these drugs soar in popularity. They say research is needed into who is likely to have reactions and how to treat them.We are playing with fire, said Dr John Timmerman, an oncologist and immunotherapy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, who recently lost a patient to side effects. The womans immunotherapy drugs had successfully melted away her cancer, he said, but some weeks later, she got cold and flu-like symptoms, and died in the emergency room from an inflammatory response that Timmerman described as a mass riot, an uprising of her immune system. Weve heard about immunotherapy as Gods gift, the chosen elixir, the cure for cancer, he said. We havent heard much about the collateral damage.Despite the warnings, physicians like Timmerman remain hugely supportive of drugs that are saving the lives of people who would otherwise die.The rub, doctors and researchers say, is that the medical system is too often caught off guard. The drugs are new, so many side effects just have not been seen. Symptoms appear at random, sometimes months after treatment, and can initially seem innocuous. Finally, oncologists are trying to treat patients with a combination of two or more immunotherapy drugs, hoping for more effective treatment but sometimes getting amplified risks.Meanwhile, these drugs are moving from the academic centres into cancer clinics, where oncologists in smaller cities most likely have less experience with the side effects.And with lives to be saved and billions of dollars to be made  $250,000 or more is the list price for a year of some regimens  not enough research has been done into the risks of the new therapies, said William Murphy, a professor of dermatology at the University of California, who reviews immunotherapy-related grants for the US government.It is a massively understudied area, Murphy said, adding, the number one priority is anti-tumor effects. Everything else, however severe, is considered the price worth paying.Caught in the middle are patients like Peal, whose stories show the delicacy of tinkering with the immune system. It may hold the keys to curing cancer if it can be at once stoked and tamed. Peal was dealing with melanoma that had spread to his lungs in June 2015 when he saw a Yale oncologist, Dr Harriet Kluger. In the past, a patient like him would have been given little chance. Wed sit the patient down and say, Im really sorry, the median life expectancy is nine months. Get your affairs in order,' said Kluger, who runs immunotherapy clinical trials, focusing on skin and kidney cancer.Illusion of hopeNow she could offer Peal hope. Consider: One study co-authored by Kluger found positive responses in more than 40% of advanced melanoma patients when they used a combination of two major immunotherapy drugs, nivolumab and ipilimumab.Peal, an engineering technician, started taking nivolumab and ipilimumab on July 8. Kluger told him he might feel drowsy or nauseated, or he could get a rash. A rash indeed struck with a vengeance on August 30. He visited Klugers office, where he was given a steroid. The next day, he had a fever, nausea and was dying of thirst , he said. He threw up everything. In four days, Peal, unable to move, took an ambulance to the emergency room.In his wallet, he kept an information card published by Bristol Myers Squibb. It lists dozens of risks, including that the therapy can cause serious side effects in many parts of your body, which can lead to death. Peals family told the emergency room doctor about the treatment, Keating, his girl friend recalled.But even Klugers experienced team, which answered the distressed phone calls, was caught off guard and did not react immediately to the symptoms. It took us by surprise. He looked absolutely fine on Friday, Kluger said. Part of the problem, she thinks, is that Peal was relatively new to the clinic and so she and her staff members did not have the experience with him to accurately assess his symptoms. It also happened very quickly. It spiraled within hours.Ultimately, Peal spent 24 days in the hospital, where trouble mounted. First his pancreas failed, then his bowels inflamed and his kidneys became dysfunctional, and to top it off, he has a fever of 103 for which we cant find a source, Kluger said. She was trying to figure it out and had emailed other experts around the country to see if they had ever had a patient with this combination of acute immune reactions. No one had seen it before.The pancreas problem was particularly noteworthy. Peals is among a growing number of such cases that have led a Yale endocrinologist, Dr Kevan Herold, an authority on autoimmunity, to conclude that he is seeing a new form of Type 1 diabetes. Typically, the peak age of onset of Type 1 diabetes is 6 to 12, and it involves the immune systems destroying, bit by bit, the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin needed to metabolise sugar into energy.Murphy, the professor at Davis who believes too little is being done, said, part of the problem, is that the drug companies that are driving research prefer working with labs that support trials moving quickly. As a result, Murphy said, human trials are advancing faster than the background research can be done."

Malnutrition manifests in several forms including stunting, wasting and micronutrient deficiency. There is an increase in the number of children and adolescents who are obese or overweight or who have high blood levels of sugar, salt, fat or cholesterol.According to the WHO, overweight and obese children tend to stay obese into adulthood, are more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like heart disease and diabetes and are at increased risk of premature death and disability in adulthood.Parents are the primary decision makers for what their children eat so it is important for them to be aware about the combination of food items that will provide full nutrition and ensure that there is no excessive weight gain. In the face of numerous outside influences, especially advertisements for junk food, parents must encourage their children to make healthier eating and lifestyle choices.A common error parents make is using their childs weight alone as an indicator of whether the child is overweight or obese. Instead, the correct estimate of body fat is given by the Body Mass Index (BMI) which is calculated using both the weight and height of a child.Causes and risk factors of childhood obesity: Lifestyle factors such as excessive consumption of junk food and calorie dense drinks, little or no physical activity and stress are the main contributors to weight gain and obesity in children.Certain studies have indicated that genes also play a role in the development of obesity. A child who comes from a family of overweight people is more likely to gain weight if not careful.Compared to some of the western countries like the United States where the prevalence of childhood obesity is higher in the lower income class because junk food and drinks are part of their daily diet, in India it is higher in children belonging to the upper-middle and high income classes.A primary reason for this is that children from middle and high class families have easier access to packaged junk food that has flooded the Indian market.High-calorie foods such as candies, chocolates, chips, biscuits, noodles and soft drinks have become the preferred snacks for children.And with the rapid expansion of global fast food joints and discounts, burgers and pizzas are increasingly replacing home cooked meals. We can prevent childhood obesity from becoming an epidemic in our country by fostering a healthier environment for our children.Guidelines for parentsHere are some tips for parents to help their child lose weight and maintain a healthy weight:Facilitate healthier eating habits: Parents should make a balanced and sustainable eating plan for their children. Children should primarily eat home cooked meals.Simply telling children to eat healthy is not enough, parents need to set a good example and actively introduce children to healthier food items. Completely depriving kids of junk food can also be counter-productive.Discourage children from overeating: Consuming more calories than the child needs for staying active through the day can be harmful. Encourage your child to consume smaller portions, eat slowly and to stop eating when she/he feels full. This point is particularly important in the Indian context as many parents, grandparents and relatives believe in stuffing children with food as a sign of affection.Encourage regular physical activity: Some level of physical activity is essential for your childs growth and development and maintenance of a healthy weight. Parents should limit screen time for their children and sign them up for physical activities they will also enjoy such as sports, swimming, cycling and dancing.With children having access to gadgets like mobile phones and tablets at a much younger age today, and little to no access to play grounds near homes, the concept of going out to play with neighbourhood children has become almost non-existent.Avoid sweetened beverages: Soft drinks and packaged juices are full of preservatives and sugar and should be discouraged.The future of our children is in our hands. Giving them sound eating and living habits are valuable gifts which can carry them through into a healthy adulthood. Parents may need to change their own lifestyles in order to do so because children learn best by watching what their parents do.(The writer is a paediatrician, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Bengaluru)"

My effort to get a government job, however, was not as desperate as my desire. Besides, my pocket expenditure was soaring to keep pace with a growing obsession to adda in tea stalls with my unemployed counterparts. Therefore, I decided to take tuitions to meet my expenses, much against my own earlier idea that taking tuition is to building others career at the cost of ones own.Riding on my old bicycle then, I preferred the narrow C I Office Road, skirting the main market, to avoid unnecessary traffic jams. Opposite the C I Office, there stood an obscure tea stall. On my way bach home in the evening, I would never fail to drop there to buy a 25 paise cup of liquor tea and a 25 paise cigarette.The inside of the tea stall was as dark as a cinema hall to a late comer, necessitating a few minutes to adjust ones vision. It was furnished with a low scaffold like bench made of bamboo props, a kerosene-stove, a three-tier open shelf incongruously stacked with glass jars of cheap biscuits, tin-cans containing tea leaves of inferior quality, sugar and an unclean saucepan of cream-less milk, a kettle, a matchbox etc. What was out of place, though, was a small pile of books in one corner. The tea stall was hardly frequented by customers.Every time I entered there, I found a dark emaciated middle-aged person engrossed in some book in the dim light of the lantern. Being a regular customer, it was not necessary for me to give my order. Leaving his book propped open, the man would light the oven and put the kettle with water, sugar and tea leaves all together to avoid extra care. He would then return to the open pages of the book until the tea was ready. Later, he would merely glance as I left a 50 paisa on the wooden box and plunge back into his book.Meanwhile, my tuitions did not last more than a year. Deplorable performance of my two students in both the semesters necessitated the appointment of a new tutor. My meek voice was the main defect, the illiterate mother of the girls pointed out. After this, I did not have to use that road again for years.Another book lover I met in the journey of life was Samiran, a high school teacher and my post-college friend. He was an avid reader, too. Although, his compulsive obsession to his family chores, he very often whined, was the main impediment in the way of him indulging in his devotion to books.Once, I related my experience with the book-loving tea stall owner whom I had met 25 years ago. Samiran expressed his eagerness to meet the man. One evening, we dropped at the tea stall on the same C I Office Road.The same darkness, furniture and a small pile of books sat in the same corner with, of course, the same person engrossed in reading a book. It seemed as if time had stopped there. I ordered two cups of liquor tea and two mini cigarettes. I asked How much? Rs 10, he said. The only other change I noticed was the spectacles that the man was wearing."

You probably realise how Columbus would have felt watching the native Red Indians peering back at him in wonder on the edge of the Dominican shores; may be as elated and joyful as the way Edison felt when he got the filament right on the electric bulb.Similarly, there are deposits that blow your mind. The deposit of fine sand on your feet after the fresh surge of wave; a bunch of chocolates from a smiling child expecting a birthday wish; happiness filling the heart like a helium balloon as you hug a hulk of a childhood friend after years of separation. Some people would like to see, most of all, a large deposit of cash in their bank accounts, particularly before a festival or a family occasion.However, as I walked out of the clinic on a humid Saturday afternoon, the deposit I discovered was rather alarming. Like the buried treasure map of a pirate, it was all printed rather neatly on a bunch of fresh, crisp sheets of paper. My escort snatched them from me and began reading the content.I might be blessing the fact of not having to read that horror with my own two malfunctioning eyes, but it was not pleasant knowing in any way. Your sugar levels are rather high, the escort said with a chuckle, adding bizarrely, you must be a real sweet person. He held my hand and guffawed with another unwanted information: The ticker on the news channel says Indias diabetes population has shot up to 69 million. Oh, you must feel pretty special to be on the 69 club.I did the imaginary eye-rolling and sighed, realising what my escort was trying. Yes, people should not make the announcement of a disease sound like death knell. They should cheer up the patient and not try making him feel dejected. Still, my escort could have done better.None of the things I discovered merit comparisons with Columbus or Edison; nor was I ecstatic to learn that I am Type-2 diabetic. Theres something about the deposit, my escort said, as I imagined him blinking his eyes trying to hide a glint in them. Deposit? Whats that? I enquired, hoping that whatever joke he was playing on me would bring genuine laughter, not a nervous perspiring grin.Yes, he said elaborately, shuffling the bunch of sheets he held. The doctor said it must be a real big one...the fat deposit in your liver. Now, dont you really feel like laughing over this?Oh yes, I would laugh if the joke was on someone else, I thought and worked hard to hold that thought to myself.But I could not help saying: I may have a disability, but Im surely an adult. The problem in that is, you can take the bad news pretty well, but not those bad jokes.Hope well be friends if I say sorry, my escort said after a long, thoughtful silence. Misplaced attempt or not, it was certainly an attempt at humour. Give me credit for that at least, he said, guiding me along the shiny hospital floors with the cool, AC air caressing our faces. I was glad that he took my jab for what it is: a plea not to be seen any differently from other people."
5904279f7be9e02646bdc806,How sugar industry shifted blame to fat,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/570207/how-sugar-industry-shifted-blame.html,2016-09-13,"How sugar industry shifted blame to fatAnahad O'connor, Sep 14, 2016, The NewYork Times: 21:36 ISTHickson paid Harvard researchers to write a review that would debunk the anti-sugar studiesThe sugar industry paid scientists in the 1960s to downplay the link between sugar and heart disease and promote saturated fat as the culprit instead, newly released historical documents show.The internal sugar industry documents, recently discovered by a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and published on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, suggest that five decades of research into the role of nutrition and heart disease may have been largely shaped by the sugar industry.They were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades, said Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at UCSF and an author of the new JAMA paper.The documents show that a trade group called the Sugar Research Foundation, known today as the Sugar Association, paid three Harvard scientists the equivalent of about $50,000 in todays dollars to publish a 1967 review of sugar, fat and heart research. The studies used in the review were hand-picked by the sugar group, and the article, which was published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, minimised the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspersions on the role of saturated fat.Even though the influence-peddling revealed in the documents dates back nearly 50 years, more recent reports show that the food industry has continued to influence nutrition science.Last year, an article in The New York Times revealed that Coca-Cola, the worlds largest producer of sugary beverages, had provided millions of dollars in funding to researchers who sought to play down the link between sugary drinks and obesity. In June, The Associated Press reported that candy-makers were funding studies that claimed that children who eat candy tend to weigh less than those who do not.The Harvard scientists and the sugar executives with whom they collaborated are no longer alive. One of the scientists who was paid by the sugar industry was D Mark Hegsted, who went on to become head of nutrition at the US Department of Agriculture, where in 1977 he helped draft the forerunner to the federal governments dietary guidelines. Another scientist was Fredrick J Stare, chairman of Harvards nutrition department.In a statement responding to the JAMA report, the Sugar Association said the 1967 review was published at a time when medical journals did not typically require researchers to disclose funding sources or potential financial conflicts of interest. The New England Journal of Medicine did not begin to require financial disclosures until 1984.The industry should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities, the Sugar Association statement said. Even so, it defended industry-funded research as playing an important and informative role in scientific debate. It said that several decades of research had concluded that sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease.The revelations are important because the debate about the harms of sugar and saturated fat continues today, Glantz said. For decades, health officials encouraged Americans to reduce their fat intake, which led many people to consume low-fat, high-sugar foods that some experts now blame for fueling the obesity crisis.It was a very smart thing the sugar industry did because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion, he said.Hegsted used his research to influence the governments dietary recommendations, which emphasised saturated fat as a driver of heart disease while largely characterising sugar as empty calories linked to tooth decay. Today, the saturated fat warnings remain a cornerstone of the governments dietary guidelines, though in recent years the American Heart Association, the World Health Organisation and other health authorities have also begun to warn that too much added sugar could increase cardiovascular disease risk.Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, wrote an editorial accompanying the new paper in which she said the documents provided compelling evidence that the sugar industry initiated research expressly to exonerate sugar as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease.I think its appalling, she said. You just never see examples that are this blatant.Dr Walter Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, said academic conflict-of-interest rules had changed significantly since the 1960s, but the industry papers were a reminder of why research should be supported by public funding rather than depending on industry funding.Willett said the researchers had limited data to assess the relative risks of sugar and fat. Given the data that we have today, we have shown the refined carbohydrates and especially sugar-sweetened beverages are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but that the type of dietary fat is also very important, he said.Manipulating opinionsThe JAMA paper relied on thousands of pages of correspondence and other documents that Cristin E Kearns, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, discovered in archives at Harvard, the University of Illinois and other libraries.The documents show that in 1964, John Hickson, a top sugar industry executive, discussed a plan with others in the industry to shift public opinion through our research and information and legislative programmes.At the time, studies had begun pointing to a relationship between high-sugar diets and the countrys high rates of heart disease. At the same time, other scientists, including the prominent Minnesota physiologist Ancel Keys, were investigating a competing theory that it was saturated fat and dietary cholesterol that posed the biggest risk for heart disease.Hickson proposed countering the alarming findings on sugar with industry-funded research. Then we can publish the data and refute our detractors, he wrote.In 1965, Hickson enlisted the Harvard researchers to write a review that would debunk the anti-sugar studies. He paid them a total of $6,500  the equivalent of $49,000 today. Hickson selected the papers for them to review and made it clear he wanted the result to favour sugar.Harvards Hegsted reassured the sugar executives. We are well aware of your particular interest, he wrote, and will cover this as well as we can.As they worked on their review, the Harvard researchers shared and discussed early drafts with the sugar executive, who responded that he was pleased with what they were writing. The Harvard scientists had dismissed the data on sugar as weak and gave far more credence to the data implicating saturated fat.Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind, and we look forward to its appearance in print, Hickson wrote.After the review was published, the debate about sugar and heart disease died down, while low-fat diets gained the endorsement of many health authorities, Glantz said. By todays standards they behaved very badly, he said."
59042acb7be9e02646bdca16,Doubts pale promise  of GM crops bounty,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/578497/doubts-pale-promise-gm-crops.html,2016-10-30,"Doubts pale promise of GM crops bountyDanny Hakim, Oct 31, 2016, International New York Times 22:29 ISTThe US and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields, while herbicide use has increasedThe controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat. But an extensive examination by The New York Times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem  genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides.The promise of genetic modification was twofold: By making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests, they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the worlds growing population, while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides.Twenty years ago, Europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the United States and Canada were embracing it. Comparing results on the two continents, using independent data as well as academic and industry research, shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise.An analysis by The Times using UN data showed that the US and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields  food per acre  when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernised agricultural producers like France and Germany. Also, a recent National Academy of Sciences report found that there was little evidence that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the US had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops.At the same time, herbicide use has increased in the US, even as major crops like corn, soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties. And the US has fallen behind Europes biggest producer, France, in reducing the overall use of pesticides, which includes both herbicides and insecticides.One measure, contained in data from the US Geological Survey, shows the stark difference in the use of pesticides. Since genetically modified crops were introduced in the US two decades ago for crops like corn, cotton and soybeans, the use of toxins that kill insects and fungi has fallen by a third, but the spraying of herbicides, which are used in much higher volumes, has risen 21%. By contrast, in France, use of insecticides and fungicides has fallen by a far greater percentage  65%  and herbicide use has decreased as well, by 36%.The industry is winning on both ends  because the same companies make and sell both the genetically modified plants and the poisons. Driven by these sales, the combined market capitalisations of Monsanto, the largest seed company, and Syngenta, the Swiss pesticide giant, have grown more than sixfold in the last decade and a half. The two companies are separately involved in merger agreements that would lift their new combined values to more than $100 billion each.When presented with the findings, Robert T Fraley, chief technology officer at Monsanto, said The Times had cherry-picked its data to reflect poorly on the industry. Every farmer is a smart businessperson, and a farmer is not going to pay for a technology if they dontthink it provides a major benefit, he said. Biotech tools have clearly driven yield increases enormously.Regarding the use of herbicides, in a statement, Monsanto said, While overall herbicide use may be increasing in some areas where farmers are following best practices to manage emerging weed issues, farmers in other areas with different circumstances may have decreased or maintained their herbicide usage.Figures from the US Department of Agriculture show herbicide use skyrocketing in soybeans, a leading GM crop, growing 2.5 times in the last two decades, at a time when planted acreage of the crop grew less than a third. Use in corn was trending downward even before the introduction of GM crops, but then nearly doubled from 2002 to 2010, before levelling off. Weed resistance problems in such crops have pushed overall usage up.To some, this outcome was predictable. The whole point of engineering bug-resistant plants was to reduce insecticide use, and it did, said Joseph Kovach, a retired Ohio State University researcher who studied the environmental risks of pesticides. But the goal of herbicide-resistant seeds was to sell more product, he said  more herbicide.Farmers with crops overcome by weeds, or a particular pest or disease, can understandably be GM evangelists. Its silly bordering on ridiculous to turn our backs on a technology that has so much to offer, said Duane Grant, chairman of Amalgamated Sugar Co, a cooperative of more than 750 sugar beet farmers in the Northwest. He says crops resistant to Roundup, Monsantos most popular weedkiller, saved his cooperative.Feeding the worldWith the worlds population expected to reach nearly 10 billion by 2050, Monsanto has long held out its products as a way to help meet the food demands of these added billions, as it said in a 1995 statement. That remains an industry mantra.Its absolutely key that we keep innovating, said Kurt Boudonck, who manages Bayers sprawling North Carolina greenhouses. With the current production practices, we are not going to be able to feed that amount of people.But a broad yield advantage has not emerged. The Times looked at regional data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, comparing main genetically modified crops in the US and Canada with varieties grown in Western Europe, a grouping used by the agency that comprises seven nations, including the two largest agricultural producers, France and Germany.For rapeseed, a variant of which is used to produce canola oil, The Times compared Western Europe with Canada, the largest producer, over three decades, including a period well before the introduction of GM crops.Despite rejecting genetically modified crops, Western Europe maintained a lead over Canada in yields. While that is partly because different varieties are grown in the two regions, the trend lines in the relative yields have not shifted in Canadas favour since the introduction of GM crops, the data show.For corn, The Times compared the US with Western Europe. Over three decades, the trend lines between the two barely deviate. And sugar beets, a major source of sugar, have shown stronger yield growth recently in Western Europe than the US, despite the dominance of genetically modified varieties over the last decade.Jack Heinemann, a professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, did a pioneering 2013 study comparing trans-Atlantic yield trends, using UN data. Western Europe, he said, hasnt been penalised in any way for not making genetic engineering one of its biotechnology choices.Biotech executives suggested making narrower comparisons. Fraley of Monsanto highlighted data comparing yield growth in Nebraska and France, while an official at Bayer suggested Ohio and France. These comparisons can be favourable to the industry, while comparing other individual US states can be unfavourable.Michael Owen, a weed scientist at Iowa State University, said that while the industry had long said GMOs would save the world, they still havent found the mythical yield gene."

Is there any plain coffee?Some years ago, I accompanied my sister to her friends house. We received a warm welcome from the couple. After a few minutes of chit-chat, they insisted that we should partake of some refreshment. While the wife busied herself with making bhelpuri, the husband said he would make us something to drink.Would you like something hot or cold? he asked. My sister said, Something hot, please.Okay. Tea or coffee? We both said Tea. Right he continued, Green tea or regular? Regular. Indian, Sri Lankan or Chinese? he asked. We were smiling now. Indian, I said.Which brand? he wanted to know. Brooke Bond, Lipton or Tata? Brooke Bond we both said in unison. (Our father worked for Brooke Bond and weve always thought of it as our company)Okay. Red Label or Taj Mahal? Red Label came the answer. Would you like pot tea or readymade? Readymade,said my sister. Our smiles were becoming broader now.Light or strong? Lightish. With or without sugar? was the next question. With. How many teaspoons per cup? One, said my sister, looking at me for confirmation and I nodded. How much milk? he persisted. Just a tad was the answer.He was still not done. He went to the sideboard and pulled out cups of three different sizes and asked us to choose which ones we wanted. By now, I was openly giggling.Finally, when the tea arrived, it was perfect, exactly how we liked it. But, I am not very finicky about such things and I wondered if I would have enjoyed the tea less if it had slightly less or more of sugar or milk or tea.In Subway outlets, one has a similar experience of choosing endlessly. At the Bengaluru airport once, beginning with white or brown bread, I had to answer a hundred questions to choose from a wide variety of fillings and accompaniments. In the end, I was so exhausted, I felt as if I had put together a dozen sandwiches myself!In fancy coffee outlets, its the same story. Remember Sridevis plight in English Vinglish? Its so difficult to choose when you have no idea what you are choosing, having never tasted anything on choice or knowing the names. Do you select Robusta or Arabica, mocha or latte? Is there any plain coffee?In every restaurant today, there are so many dishes available that instead of breaking my head deciding what to eat, I end up ordering the same old tried-and-tested dishes. Of course, some dishes have such fancy names that you have to try them at least once, like Ants Climbing Tree and Chicken in Taros Nest, and once, in England, there was an ice-cream called Screaming Orgasm!And another time, we were in a rural hole in the wall restaurant. There was no menu and the only thing available was meals. So, we ordered it. It was a delicious thali meal consisting of two chapatis, rice, dal, sambar and four different vegetables, papad and pickles. We didnt have to pick the vegetables or decide how we wanted them cooked. What a relief!"
59042d817be9e02646bdcc22,Diabetes and diet:  the low-carb debate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/572608/diabetes-diet-low-carb-debate.html,2016-09-26,"Diabetes and diet: the low-carb debateBy Gina Kolata, Sep 27, 2016, International New York Times 23:58 ISTA few years ago, Dr Richard Kahn, the now-retired chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, was charged with organising a committee to prescribe a diet plan for people with diabetes. He began by looking at the evidence for different diets, asking which, if any, best controlled diabetes.When you look at the literature, whoa is it weak. It is so weak, Kahn said in a recent interview. Studies tended to be short term, diets unsustainable, differences among them clinically insignificant. The only thing that really seemed to help people with diabetes was weight loss  and for weight loss, there is no magic diet.But people want diet advice, Kahn reasoned, and the association really should say something about diets. So it, like the National Institutes of Health, went with the Department of Agricultures food pyramid.Why? Its a diet for all America, Kahn said. It has lots of fruit and vegetables and a reasonable amount of fat.That advice, though, recently came under attack in a New York Times commentary written by Sarah Hallberg, an osteopath at a weight loss clinic in Indiana, and Osama Hamdy, the medical director of the obesity weight loss programme at the Joslin Diabetes Centre at Harvard Medical School.There is a diet that helps with diabetes, the two doctors said: one that restricts  or, according to Hallberg, severely restricts  carbohydrates.If the goal is to get patients off their medications, including insulin, and resolve rather than just control their diabetes, significant carb restriction is by far the best nutrition plan, Hallberg said in an email.This would include elimination of grains, potatoes and sugars and all processed foods. There is a significant and ever growing body of literature that supports this method. She is in private practice at Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital and is medical director of a startup developing nutrition-based medical interventions.But there are no large and rigorous studies showing that low-carbohydrate diets offer an advantage, and, in fact, there is not even a consensus on the definition of a low-carbohydrate diet  it can vary from doctor to doctor.There have been debates for literally the whole history of diabetes about which kind of diet is best, said Dr C Ronald Kahn, chief academic officer at Joslin, and no relation to Richard Kahn. But, he said, the answer isnt so straightforward.In support of a diet like Hallbergs, there is one recent short-term study, by Kevin Hall of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and his colleagues, involving 17 overweight and obese men, none of whom had diabetes. They stayed in a clinical centre where they ate carefully controlled diets.The researchers asked what would happen if calories were kept constant but the carbohydrate composition of a diet varied from high to very low. The answer was that insulin secretion dropped 50% with the very low carbohydrate diet, meaning that much less insulin was required to maintain normal blood glucose levels.Since diabetes results when the body cant produce enough insulin, perhaps it is a good idea to reduce the amount of insulin it needs by eating very low carbohydrate diets, Hall said.Some longer-term studies, though, failed to show that low-carbohydrate diets benefited glucose control. Even if diets are effective in the short term, Hall said, the difficulty is adhering to the diet over the long term.In an analysis of weight loss diets (not specifically for diabetics) published this summer, he and Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa wrote: Diet adherence is so challenging that it is poor even in short-term studies where all food is provided. When diets are prescribed, adherence is likely to diminish over the long term despite self-reports to the contrary.But short-term studies of just a few weeks, which constitute the bulk of the diet studies, can be misleading, said C Ronald Kahn. In the short term, the low-carbohydrate diet sometimes does better on glycaemic control, he said. But as time progresses, the difference mostly disappears. What counts is which diet helps most with long-term weight loss.The reason the advantage sometimes seen with a low-carbohydrate diet tends to vanish, C Ronald Kahn added, is probably a mixture of people failing to adhere to the diets and their bodies adjusting to them.Lon-term impactAnother issue with low-carbohydrate diets, researchers said, is the question of what will happen to overall health if diabetics actually follow the diet for years or decades. (Heart attacks are the major killer of people with diabetes.)Insulin levels may be better, but, said Dr Rudolph Leibel, co-director of Columbia Universitys Naomi Berrie Diabetes Centre, effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on lipoproteins and vascular biology could offset such a benefit. In other words, it is not clear if a lower insulin level would translate into fewer heart attacks.Hamdy, whose recommended low-carbohydrate diet is less restrictive than the one Hallberg suggests, reports that many patients in his clinic have been able to stay with the diet for as long as five years, losing weight and keeping it off. He presented his study at the 2015 annual conference of the American Diabetes Association and has submitted it for publication. It involved 129 patients. Half were able to lose weight and keep it off, and those who did maintained an average weight loss of 9.5%. Their diabetes was much improved.It is impossible, Hamdy said, to separate weight loss from the diets effects on diabetes because people following such a diet  which limits but does not forbid things like breads, pasta and rice  also lose weight.But multiple studies have found that when it comes to weight loss  the only proven way to help with blood sugar control over the long term  there is no difference among diets that restrict calories, fat or carbohydrates.Experts like David Nathan, director of the diabetes centre and clinical research centre at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, advise dieting for people with diabetes.But, he said, when we advise people to be on diets, the major goal is to lose weight. What matters the most for controlling diabetes, Nathan said, is how much weight you lose."
59042da67be9e02646bdcc3f,Many positives of telemedicine,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573896/many-positives-telemedicine.html,2016-10-03,"Many positives of telemedicineBy Arjun Kalyanpur, Oct 04, 2016, 0:02 ISTThe word telemedicine conjures up images of a patient consulting a doctor who is at another location, through videoconferencing. This is the core of telemedicine.However, telemedicine has since evolved along many paths with new and innovative applications and roles emerging constantly. Imagine a radiologist based in India analysing an emergent CT scan performed on a patient in an emergency room in the US and discussing the findings with a physician across the globe!At the heart of advances in medical science lies drug discovery, the process by which new medications are discovered. The process of drug discovery involves conducting clinical trials or research studies that validate the safety and efficacy of a new treatment. This is both expensive (a 2014 study estimates the cost at $2.4 billion per drug) and time consuming (up to 10 years in some cases).Pharma and biotech companies which are involved in drug development today, therefore, face major challenges. Telemedicine offers some innovative solutions to such challenges, which address both the time and cost components of clinical trials.For example, clinical trial recruitment or the process of enrolling patients for clinical trials has proved to be a significant challenge for pharma companies and is viewed as one of the costliest aspects of drug development. This is particularly important in a condition where the patients are not able to be present in a healthcare centre or lab (for example, stroke, heart attack and other such acute conditions).Utilising telemedicine for patient recruitment in such situations is beneficial to sponsors as well as CROs (clinical research organisations) which are the entities that coordinate clinical trials. In emergency and time sensitive conditions, such as an acute stroke, the use of telemedicine can help with patient enrolment into a clinical trial.For instance, a patient suffering from an acute stroke in a rural hospital, can benefit from the latest investigational treatment protocols, facilitated by a telemedicine interaction between the general practitioner at the rural site and the neurologist and trial coordinator in the tertiary care centre, such as a university teaching hospital.Another area where telemedicine plays an important role is in patient coordination and monitoring. For example, a trial known as REMOTE being conducted by the pharma major Pfizer to investigate a new treatment for overactive bladders relies on telemedicine technology to connect patients with a trial investigator over an online platform.Clinical trialsAdditionally, many patients who are enrolled in clinical trials can be monitored while at home using home healthcare monitoring techniques which are an extension of telemedicine, as the parameters that are measured such as blood pressure and blood sugar may be remotely uploaded to a central database server. This has the potential to reduce trial costs as the patient does not need to be brought to a medical centre simply for the purpose of monitoring vital signs or other basic parameters.An interesting space that has opened up in the last decade or so is in the area of imaging in clinical trials. Drug discovery today is to an extent dependent on medical imaging. For example, the efficacy of most anti-cancer treatments is determined based on whether the CT, MRI or PET scan shows a decrease in tumour size, referred to as response. The science of drug discovery is therefore tied with the science of medical imaging.This has in turn led to the creation of Image Core Lab  an entity that uses teleradiology to transfer images from diagnostic centres to a centralised facility where specialist radiologists analyse these images using defined protocols such as Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST).Teleradiology further allows the image data to be stored for the duration of the trial subject to the strict security guidelines that regulatory agencies impose on such patient data. The Image Core Lab model provides a high quality analysis of the imaging data by imaging specialists with specific expertise in the area of clinical research.In an era of severe radiologist shortages, the outsourced Core Lab model ensures timely analysis of the imaging data that helps reduce the duration of drug discovery cycle while providing a cost-effective solution. In the pharma/biotech industrys ongoing quest to constantly bring new lifesaving treatments to the world, telemedicine offers the potential to be a long-standing and effective partner.(The writer is MD, CEO and chief radiologist/pusher, Teleradiology Solutions)"

After retirement, Mr C settled down in Delhi and Mr P in Bengaluru, but they made it a point to keep in touch with each other on phone and via email.Mrs C planned to go out of Delhi for two weeks once and when Mr P learnt about it, he invited his friend to Bengaluru instead of spending the hot summer alone, an invitation his friend readily accepted. Thus, Mr C landed at his friends house late one night.In the morning, there was a knock on his door and the helper brought him the very own south Indian kaapi in a steel tumbler. C sahib hated the smell but politely accepted it and added loads of sugar to gulp it down his throat.C sahib and his friend sat in the lawn, reading newspapers, interspersed with the gossip of the days, when Mrs P walked up to them and announced that the breakfast was ready. By sheer habit, he was hoping to see aloo, puree, pickles and egg bhhujia, but instead found idli, dosa, vada and sambar with the attendant chutneys. The breakfast was served in a silver thaali.Mr C was flummoxed and waited for the host and the hostess to take the lead. Being accustomed to using both hands in tearing his purees apart into bits and pieces, he found himself handicapped, having to rest his left hand on the knee.The friends spent their morning sightseeing and came home for lunch. What Mr C found on the lunch table was yet another unfamiliar sight. As he started digging in, he was given a detailed introduction by Mrs P somewhat like, Mr C, meet Mr Kharabhaat, made out of rice and lentils. Mrs Rasam was served in small bowls and there was left over sambar from the morning to complete the meal. The meal ended with curd rice which Mr C laced with pickles to convert the blandness into spiciness.Coconut seemed to be the backbone of the meals. He was hoping to be served a Patiala peg but was insteadoffered some fresh coconut water.However, in about five days, Mr C got so hooked to the south Indian dishes that Mrs P had to double the produc-tion and spray red pepper flakes on the dosas.Back home, after Mrs C had come back from her holiday, Mr C came to the dining table to find the oil-laced bhaturas and channa laid out. He threw a fit and demanded idli sambar, kharabhaat and coconut chutney. Mrs C, who didnt know how to react to this outburst, kept a glum face and kept out of trouble by leaving the dining room.Mr C then enrolled his driver, Raghu, to drive him to various Udupi hotels and eateries located in different parts of Delhi. He also made it a point to carry a flask to bring home a few cups of Darshini-like coffee.Post script. It is reliably learnt that Mrs C is taking practical lessons in South Indian culinary meals from Mrs Gowda, living on the sixth floor of their apartment complex. She also spends many hours on YouTube watching demonstrations of making idlis, dosas and other south Indian dishes."

For onion, it was (-)64.19 per cent.The rate of inflation in sugar was at 35.36 per cent and that for fruits rose by 13.91 per cent during the month.""The pick-up in wholesale inflation was broadly in line with our expectation, with an adverse base effect outweighing the cooling effect of lower food inflation,"" ICRA Senior Economist Aditi Nayar said.Assocham said prices of products like pulses, potato and fibres, which are of national interest, has been rising at industry level but recent concern is sugar which has started to rise at much higher rate which policy makers should address using supply side responses.""Government should take steps to address the structural issues of demand and supply within the industry to maintain the inflation within the target range continuously for at least 6 months,"" Assocham said.However, deflationary trend continued in some items like petrol at (-)8.65 per cent and minerals (-)3.44 per cent.The inflation print for manufactured articles read at 2.42 per cent in August, up from 1.82 per cent in July.ICRA further said core-WPI inflation is expected to inch up further in the coming months and remain in a range of 0.5-2 per cent in the remainder of this fiscal.The WPI inflation for June has been revised upwards at 2.12 per cent, against provisional estimate of 1.62 per cent.""Wholesale inflation has undergone a sizable upward revision of 40-50 basis points for the last four months, which is a source of some concern,"" Nayar said.WPI inflation is expected to print between 4-4.5 per cent in the remainder of 2016, whereas CPI inflation would range within 4-5 per cent in the same months, ICRA said.The rise in WPI inflation in August is in contrast to the retail inflation which eased to a five-month low of 5.05 per cent in the month.The cooling of retail inflation and 2.4 per cent contraction of factory output in July has revived hopes for a rate cut by RBI in its next policy meet on October 4 to boost growth.In its monetary policy review last month, the RBI had maintained status quo on key rates citing upside risks to 5 per cent inflation target for March 2017.Moving towards the new regime, the government had in July notified 4 per cent inflation target for the next five years, based on which the monetary policy committee (MPC) would take its decisions going forward.It also provides for a margin of plus or minus 2 per cent in this target, thus fixing the upper tolerance level at 6 per cent till 2021.The MPC will set interest rates by majority, with a casting vote for the central bank governor in the event of a tie.Out of six members of MPC, three will be from RBI - the Governor, who will be the ex-officio Chairperson, a deputy governor and an executive director.The other three members will be appointed by the central government, on the recommendations of a search-cum-selection committee, headed by the Cabinet Secretary.It remains to be seen whether the October 4 policy could be decided by the MPC."

How can we erase the rural-urban divide?It is nature that offers us the main relief when the rites of spring give way to summer. We fear the heat of the sun and its consequences: scarce water, shallow rivers, dry vegetation, poor harvests, higher costs and the dire hazard of a failed monsoon.The sole solace we can rely on in Mysuru is the blooming of treetops  the palette of mauve, orange, scarlet, white, pink, blue in multiple shades. Even the creepers and the small bushes, trees native and those brought here by foreign hands over centuries  cassia, tabebuia, frangipani, jacaranda and gulmohar.An American poet of 20th century wrote this memorable quote: I think that I shall never see/ A poem as lovely as a tree. The poem ended with the line, Only God can make a tree.A tranquil stretch in our vicinity is the Cheluvamba Park, where we go for an evening stroll; we greet friends and passers-by, thrilled by the bounty of flowering trees. They shed their leaves early, when the bare branches take on a curving geometry, as if to text us in natures own calligraphic script. Days later the branches become bouquets of soft, yellow flowers. Just to behold that splendour is a sensuous experience for our fingertips, like the tactile feel of touching the tender head of a child.This park is a refuge for folks to chatter and exchange notes on hopes and setbacks, transgressions, moral outrages, events national or suburban. At the entrance, a pergola of bougainvillea in magenta purple has flourished since 1945.Wise town-planners and rulers tended these plants, gifting us avenues of floral canopies, as though to calm us in times of trial and doleful reports of accidents and shameful stories of human violence, villainy and cruelty. Tiny tots always amuse us with their cute antics and marches. They gaze at an old person, and decide instantly whether the senior will be friendly or stern.Once, an old man hobbled in and sat down on our bench, laying his crutch aside. He told us he felt fine, though he had been diagnosed as both diabetic and hypertensive. He quipped that age was a mere number. A little later, his doctor, whom we knew, told us that the old man was his strangest case. At the clinic, he had claimed that he would not give up salt and sugar in his diet, arguing that, after all, his blood was salty and had stalked away, muttering, Life is sweet."
590466a77be9e04154df653a,From surgical strike to amnesty window,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/on-second-thought/from-surgical-strike-to-amnesty-window/,2016-12-30,"On November 8, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision to demonetize high denomination currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, his top ministers claimed it was a surgical strike against the corrupt.50 days on, this surgical strike has become a story of shifting goal posts and worse an amnesty window to give the corrupt another chance to legalize their black money.The rules have been changed over a 100 times. Critics called it poor planning, government claimed it was being sensitive to peoples hardship. At the receiving end were, we the common people, struggling to make sense out of the madness.The whole nation, every state, every district, every town, society and household was directly affected by the grand decision to phase out the two most circulated currency tenders in our country.I dont need to go into the details of how it affected every person in this country as that has already been broadcast across media, and is still playing at select ATMs everywhere, and of course, at every bank outlet that there is.In a poetic perspective perhaps, one can dare to say that the whole nation indeed, became equal. Equal, in their suffering to stand in never ending queues outside the few ATMs that would be found working. Equal, in witnessing and going through the difficulty of withdrawing their hard-earned, fully-accounted-for money that suddenly became scarce. Scare, to the point of making it very difficult to purchase things of essential nature, of day to day use.Despite such difficulty, the present-day plebeians displayed some immense capacity to adapt. We adapted to the hardship of finding a working ATM, standing in queue, day in and day out, most of the days returning empty-handed, while adding little-by-little to the deep-seated but nothing-to-be-done kind of anger within us. Yet, there was a renewed hope of a new dawn, where accessibility to our own hard-earned money seemed possible.Apart from this, the driving force within each of us was possibly the grand promise made by the Prime Minister and his party colleagues that this step was a surgical strike on black money.The feeling that all those who have been enjoying exceptional purchasing power with their black money were soon to find themselves reduced to any other common person, who has worked hard to keep going, financially, helped soothe the anger of standing in queue.Many prominent leaders made grand statements. Defence minister Manohar Parrikar went to the extent of terming the decision as a surgical strike. He said, Demonetisation is another war by the Prime Minister. This is war against black money which affects the economy of the state. Black money is responsible for inflation in the country  Shaktikanta Das, secretary, Economic Affairs, said, The action taken by the enforcement agencies on illegally accumulated money is based on specific inputs, you may call it a surgical strike.What is interesting in this developing process is the fact that the decision to demonetise notes was taken with a certain perspective. The perspective of weeding out unaccounted cash, which was helping unnecessary inflation while at the same time finding its way into the pockets of those who fund terror.This indeed seemed to be a revolutionary step, initially, as what was immediately visible was the fact that getting hold of Rs 2,000 currency tender seemed to be a very difficult job. Over and above that, the cap on daily withdrawal from ATMs and banks helped to reinforce the claim that the government was making.So, in a way, everyone was basking in the pain of others. Cash, indeed seemed to have suddenly become difficult to acquire. Seemingly so, for the ultra-rich too.But, clearly, this wasnt what it was supposed to be. Very soon, several raids across the country made it astonishingly clear that a few people still could access huge amounts of the newly-released currency.What seemed to be exceptionally difficult to have, was already found stashed in the homes of a select few. New currency was being unearthed from left, right and centre.This added to the frustration of people, who were made to stand in queues for hours for one new 2,000 note.However, this wasnt the end of it.Then came the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), which made it frustratingly simple to turn black money into legal currency and that too officially.The official website reads: If you are willing to declare the unaccounted income under the new Pradhan Mantri Garib Yojana, it is very easy and to do that you need to follow three steps What seemed like a move to penalise the hoarders of unaccounted money was suddenly turned on its head. From a surgical strike on black money, it became a compliance window for the super-rich, to still be able to enjoy part of their illegal money by just going through, what one can call, some kind of simple penance.Whatever hope the people had of seeing the downfall of corrupt, was truly shattered.The woes that began with sudden shortage of cash still remain, at least for the majority of the people across the country.What has changed though, is the fact that those who were supposed to be penalised are now getting a legal window, in quite a welcoming tone, to turn part of their unaccounted cash into legal money.This, for me, raises a huge question mark on the intentions of the present government, especially towards the less privileged in this country.It seems that everything that this government has announced as a step to strengthen the less privileged, is just a sugar coating."
590466d47be9e04154df657d,New Year resolutions for senior citizens,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/mentor-counsel-coach/new-year-resolutions-for-senior-citizens/,2016-12-16,"The New Year is round the corner and it is time to think of those resolutions again! Whether you resolve to be fitter and healthier, connect more socially or to tick off some points on your bucket list, this is a time to take stock of the year gone by and to think of the year ahead.Given below are some thoughts and you could consider adding some or all to your list of New Year resolutions.Eat better for your healthTake your health into your hands. Change your eating pattern. Take baby steps towards eating right. After all if you have been careless with your food habits, you cannot change it overnight.Less fats, more fibre with a healthier mix of fruits, vegetables and nuts is always advisable for most people. As senior citizens, it becomes even more important and relevant for us to regulate our diet. Eat smaller meals more often. Most experts recommend eating 5 times a day but with reduced quantities. As some wise people say stop eating just before you are full! Others say that at least half of your plate should be fruits and vegetable.Add a mix of vitamins and supplements to your diet to balance what you are not receiving through your normal diet.Remember that eating better is the only answer to reducing your weight.Find a new, healthy activityAs we get older, whether or not we have been active earlier, now it is much more important to be active. Build exercise or yoga into your daily routine. A round of tennis or golf, a brisk walk for at least 30 minutes every day (150 minutes per week of walking is the minimum recommended), yogic breathing exercises, swimming or cycling would be great to get into your daily schedule.I have met several seniors who have started running and competing with people of their own age. In the process of staying fit, they have also found a whole new community of like-minded and passionate friends. It is best to experiment and find the right activity for your personality and activity level.Complete some points in your bucket listGive yourself a break. You have earned this. Over the years, all of us have been adding to our bucket list. This list has kept getting longer since we were not able to find the time during our work life.Resolve to tick off at least two significant items on your bucket list in the coming year.Connect more with friends and familyRe-establish old connections that you lost while you were busy at work. Dont wait for someone else to take the first step. Once start to reach out to your family and friends, you will be surprised at how much warmth you will receive.Weekly lunches or coffee mornings with a group of friends, WhatsApp or Skype calls with your family members spread across the World are great ways of re-connecting. Time spent talking and laughing with those that mean the most is time well spent.Reduce your belongingsResolve to clean out your closets and your home. Think of the difference between want and need before you start this exercise. Keep things you need and give away those you want. This may sound philosophical but try and give away whatever you have not used for the past one year. Your challenge will always be what if you suddenly need the item again. If you decide to give it away, keep this as an active resolution till the next year and then assess whether you felt the need for the item(s) you gave away. Chances are that you will never miss these items.In addition, this will start a process of de-cluttering your belongings and clearing up your home over a period of time.Brush up on new technologyTechnology, as you are well aware, is changing our World. If you have not already understood the many forms of communication and connection through Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube and so many others it is time to do so now. Get familiar with the operating systems of your phones and other devices. Learn and understand these platforms since more and more of our lives will revolve around applications being developed on such platforms and around such communication medium.To brush-up your own knowledge and skills, there are on-line tutorials for every possible question that you may have. You can also request a younger person at home or in your neighbourhood to tutor you.Tell your storyYou have had a wonderful and fulfilling life and now is the time to tell your story. Write your blog and publish it on a daily or weekly basis. Think of all the anecdotes in your life and write about these. Think of the milestones in your career and the time you spent as a child and record these. Think of your parents and your extended family and store these memories carefully in writing.If you are not comfortable with writing out your blogs, dictate these into your mobile phone. Most phones now have the feature of voice to text which should quickly convert your voice recording. If this too does not work, send the recording to anyone who will transcribe it for a very small fees. A dictated blog will also preserve your voice for posterity.Not only will this record your own memories and thoughts, this could also become a record of your family history for the future generations.Give your brain a workoutThe more you exercise your brain, like your body, the stronger it will be. Remember that diseases of the brain like Dementia and Alzheimers are increasing.Read more and beyond your daily newspaper. Join or start discussion groups on subjects that interest you. Try Sudoko, Chess, QuizUp or Scrabble. All these games are available free on your smart phone. Play online with people you do not know and compete with the best. Nothing prevents you from becoming the best in the region or for that matter in the World, using your brain and not brawn power.Once you take the lead you will find lots of followers who want to play with you but were hesitant to take the lead.Remove negativity and anxiety from your lifeLife is too short and at our stage in life, we are already on the back nine of a round of golf! Now is the time to remove all the negativity we have carried inside us about family, friends and the World in general. All this negativity is only hurting ourselves.If you are feeling anxious about someone or something, speak about it to your family and friends. Bottling this up inside you will only make it more challenging to deal with.Resolve to celebrate the little joys that you will have and dont hold back.Get enough sleepMost people seem to believe in a myth that as you get older you need lesser sleep. Nothing is farther away from the truth. If you are sleeping late or getting up very early, stay in bed longer than you normally would have and soon you will be sleeping longer and waking up much more rested. Avoid your daytime nap in the early days till your night time sleeping pattern becomes normal. Then you can easily go back to your power siesta as well!Get regular medical check-upsMonitor, manage and record your blood pressure, your blood sugar and your weight in a regular systematic manner. If you dont have any of these challenges, consider yourself blessed. It is necessary for you to get annual medical check-ups done and if you did not get a checkup this year, resolve to undergo a comprehensive check up in the New Year.Finally, as you celebrate during this festive season with your loved ones, raise a toast to the coming year, but with a smaller glass!Wish you a very happy, healthy and prosperous New Year."

In Dear Zindagi Alia Bhatt is seen hanging out with her psychiatrist, a male and deliciously low-key Shahrukh Khan. She is the emotional bumbler and he the smoothening agent in her life. Mr Sane to her Miss Scatty. But does being a woman generally mean more relationship problems and messier lives than men?Men and women are different, we get that. Men knit brows, women knit booties. Female menopause is hot flushes, male menopause a hot fling. A man takes a woman, a woman gives herself to a man. Kept woman sounds kind of broke, sugar daddy sounds like an ice cream. Dad bod is desirable, mom bod avoid.Gender disparities are pervasive in online labour marketplaces too, according to a US study to be out early next year. Another research says men wrote 52% of the articles relating to reproductive rights in the US while women only 37%, leading to the question: whose uterus is it, anyway?It is also very feminine world over to earn less than men. If the average woman works 39 days more than a man in a year, Indian women work 50 days more, according to the latest Global Gender Gap report from the World Economic Forum (WEF). Only another 170 years or so for global gender parity, yay! We will be equally paid then, if somewhat dead.The New York Times has already been sued for sexism along with ageism and racism in the workplace. Women are sometimes sacked in the womb.Be it a watch ad or brochures for boxers, men look ready to launch rockets to outer space while women are happy just to hang off their arms. And then there is the whole question of balancing family and career, touchingly put only to women: Who looks after your kids while you are acting or writing or working?In Victorian times, women were put in asylums for being nervy and hysterical. They needed smelling salts to sit upright. And now with people living long with medical advances, women live longer than men; leaving them with more time on their hands to brood on whats not going right, oh dear.Who wears the pants? is a macho query. Until men wear skirts to make a power statement, damsels will remain in some distress. We are doomed to pull hair, cry buckets, as we queue up like Oliver Twist on pay day, saying, Please, sir, I want some more."
590471077be9e04154df6c9f,Children’s Day: People reveal the most foolish things they did as a kid,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/everything-social/people-reveal-the-most-foolish-things-they-did-as-a-kid/,2016-11-14,"No jobs, no deadlines, no unanswered emails from fussy bosses, no bills and no EMIs. Lets be honest  there is no better phase in life than childhood. This Childrens Day, users on Quora reveal the most foolish things they did while growing up1. I tried to prove that girls can pee standing.This traces back to the second or third grade. I wondered how was it that guys could pee standing. That gave them the advantage of peeing anywhere they wanted, especially in cases of urgency. That was unfair. I thought it was because their pants had a zipper. But then I discovered, we have zippers too. Perhaps we can pee standing too, just someone needed to set the trend.The day came when we were at a relatives marriage party, and I needed to pee urgently. My mom took me to the washroom and I decided to prove it.I came out with wet pants. My mom didnt understand how her little genius suddenly managed to wet her pants completely after years of peeing properly. I spent the rest of the party in the car. I was still unable to understand why I failed.Yeah. I get the reason now. Barbie Giri, med student from Jamshedpur2. I was a curious child, a very curious child. I had a lot of questions, lot of answers, and it was my lifes motive to know how things worked and cranked. And yes, I was especially curious about how fire worked!Age 5: While sitting on the balcony in my grandmas house (on the 2nd floor) I saw a black cat strolling on the roadside. So like any 5 year old, I gauged the height of my jump, considered the acceleration due to gravity, and calculated the velocity at which I would hit the ground. And I jumped. (Un)fortunately I fell on the 1st floor and by the time I regained my senses, the cat had run away (much to my dismay). I told everyone how my pencil had fallen down, and earned praises of being stupid but studious. Score.Age 7: During summer vacations, I borrowed homework notebooks of my neighbor, took them under my bed (with her), and set them on fire. Yes, under the bed. Needless to say that the bedsheet caught fire, that she outed me, that there was a lot of explanation to do and a ton of apologies to be made by my mother. Score.Age 8-9: During Diwali, the festival of lights, I was curious to know if a Chakarghinni would rotate when kept in my palm. Yes, in my palm. I learnt a lesson that it would surely rotate, but at the same time, would burn the hell out of my hand. My hand was ash white for 2 weeks, and I chose to bandage it with 20-30 bandaids and hide it from my parents for 2 weeks by wearing gloves, day and night. Ouch.Age 10: Now I wanted to know how plastic burned. I began collecting different kinds of plastic materials  cellophane sheets, plastic bags, pens, bubble wraps, balls, packaging, and even my toys  and started burning them sequentially. Little did I know that plastic drops like this (see image below), when burned. I have faint marks all over my left foot to prove the phenomenon.Age 11: Now I knew how plastic burned and also how crackers burned in my hands. However, I didnt know how they burned if someone lit the entire lot  rockets, anaars, bombs, etc.,  altogether. My theory was that they would burn in a matter of seconds in a huge explosion and of course I decided to test the theory. 15 odd people sitting in the living room suddenly rushed for cover as rockets came hurling at them from the lawn. Rest is history.Age 12: My interest now shifted to anything electronic and mechanical. I would take apart every toy to see how it worked, and mostly manage to put it back together too. So one day I found an LED and found it to be very pretty  such glorious light! Such glory! However, the LEDs light was quite dim, so I hypothesized that it wasnt getting enough current. Guess what, I decided to put it in the AC socket while holding it (yes, while holding it), and switched on the power button. Ouch.Age 12: Did this, many many times, at the top of a 4 storied building because we were just being playful (yes, just being playful) and this felt like being on the edge, quite literally.Age 13: Electronics was still the in-thing in my life. Once our Television set stopped working, so the electrician came home to repair it. This is how the back of a television set looks when zoomed in:Curious, I decided to see what these little colored cylinders were. I pulled them all out, and took them to the electrician to ask him what they were. Yes. The TV was destroyed (for a while!) till they could find a replacement PCB and it cost a bomb.Age 14: We had just learned of solenoid  a thin loop of wire, often wrapped around a metallic core, which produces a magnetic field when an electric current is passed through. The concept of seeing electricity and magnetism work together made me drool with delight. So of course, like any excellent physicist, I considered the current, number of turns, and the length, to calculate the magnetic field (calculated it incorrectly by an order of 2), and then I decided to test it. I used makeshift garage parts, and plugged the wires into an AC socket Yes and ouch!There were many more of these foolish, funny, and scary acts that I did as a child. In hindsight it all sounds quite scary! I must mention that I was an extremely mischievous & sneaky child and it was difficult to find me if I didnt want to be found; my parents really did their best! I am very lucky to survive most of these unscathed (for life, at least!).PS: Whatever little my parents know, those things are still talk of the town when my aunts and uncles visit from other cities. Akash Raman3. Managed to get my right thumb chopped off.Take a look at this contraption:Can you see the long handle/bar at to the 4 oclock position of the wheel? My brother (15) and I (9) were playing a game where I would sit on that handle, and my brother would then grab hold of the rim of the wheel and give it a quick half-circle spin, clockwise. As the wheel turned, and the handle went up, I would rise up 4 feet in the air, and then come down when the wheel turned the other way as my brother let go of the wheel. It was fun. In fact, exhilarating. It was our own mini-amusement-park, experience-free-fall ride.Did I forget to mention that the curved S shape in the the middle of the wheel (giving the wheel a yin-yang shape) is actually two semicircular blades? This contraption is used for chopping sticks and other cattle-fodder into little 1-inch bits. You stuff a stick in the gaping mouth like opening that you see just above the handle, and as you turn the wheel the two blades alternately slice off anything thats sticking out of the mouth.So, we were playing there. And since the handle was a little high off the ground compared to the height of my butt, so I couldnt get on it without support. So here was the sequence we followed:1. Put my hands in the mouth of the machine for support2. Sit on handle3. Remove hands4. Brother turns the wheelNeither of us had yet done our computer science degrees, so we did not see that the algorithm has a race condition, and we ended up doing #3 and #4 in the wrong order. I was lucky to get my left hand out, and most of my right hand out of the mouth before the blade descended, but ended up losing my right thumb in the process.This was the result:Fortunately, it wasnt as bad as you might expect. I learnt to write with the remaining fingers of my right hand  I hold the pen between my index and middle fingers. Thats me holding a bottle:My studies did not suffer  nor did anything else. In fact, I am not disabled or even inconvenienced in any way. The only things that I cannot really do well are peeling potatoes, and bowling  thats it. Otherwise, it is hardly noticeable. Navin Kabra, founder of a startup and father of 2 kids4. I tried to make my own powerpuff girlsWhen I was some 5 years old, I was always curious while watching the show on how did Professor Utonium create those girls. The starting theme of the show gave some instructions (sugar, spice and everything nice) but I never got to know what is the coveted chemical X.Then in one of the episodes, The Rowdyruff Boys (Episode), it was shown that Mojo Jojo made Rowdyruff boys by accidentally dropping everything in the toilet. EUREKA!!Next thing which I did, I gathered all my toys and things which were fun (everything nice) some sugar and salt to create my own Powerpuff Girls. I threw everything I owned in the toilet, and flushed. Expecting to see some creatures flying out, I was disappointed when I saw nothing but everything getting ruined and making loud noises.My mom came running to see and demanded an explanation. I tried my best but she just couldnt understand. If only she knew how big of a genius I was. Sigh. Shobhit Bakliwal, Rajasthan5: Disclaimer: This post contains a nude child, undies and sambar.This happened when I was 5/6 years of age. My family and some visiting cousins were having lunch in the dining table. I had finished early and wanted to use the loo. Now, I had this habit of removing all my clothes before I went into the bathroom (sadly enough). And so there I was, in the hall, underwear in hand, ready to run towards the bathroom, for which I had to pass through the dining hall.I start running, and as I pass the dining table, I see my mum. And all of a sudden I feel like she should be the one holding my undies, and so I throw it at her!Now let me explain how throwing works.That day came to be called the Jetty Sambar day. I remember feeling really stupid and embarrassed after that. I mean, who wouldnt!? Shyam Krishna, KozhikodeWhat was the most foolish thing you did as a kid? Let us know in the comments section."
590471897be9e04154df6d78,Fortune Tikki at Katra Neel,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/delhi-belly/fortune-tikki-at-katra-neel/,2016-12-07,"This aloo tikkiwalla in Old Delhi owes his fortune to a wicket gate. He sits within the historic red-coloured gateway to Chandni Chowks Katra Neel.In another era, this gateway was a mute witness to shots fired from British guns to suppress the waves of men and women who rose to the Mahatmas call during the Quit India Movement in 1942.Gopal Kishen, 60, says he started selling tikkis here in 1975, the year Indira Gandhi declared Emergency. Fearing forced sterilization, the rickshawallas soon vanished from the streets and it was difficult to cart my wares daily from Katra Mangal Sen (near Jama Masjid) to Katra Neel.As a teenager, Gopal learned tikka making from his elder brother, who used to sell them from a pushcart in Kinari Bazaar. What seems like a simple, ready-to-fry snack, he says, involves considerable labour and attention to detail.Preparations begin early morning at Gopals kitchen, in his tenement in Katra Mangal Sen, where pahadi aloo is boiled with minimal water, just enough to cook the potatoes and not let them crack open. The cooked aloo is peeled and left to cool.Then begins the coarse grinding of chana dal that has been soaked overnight. The dal ki pitthi is fried in ghee with jeera, hing and haldi, topped with homemade masala and freshly cut green chilli, ginger and dhania. The stuffing is ready.The aloo is then grated, kneaded with cornflour and stuffed with dal ki pitthi to make patties, which are later shallow fried, at Katra Neel, on a large tawa till they turn golden brown. The crispy tikkis are finally served with a topping of green dhania-pudina and methi chutney or sandwiched in bread.The green chutney is prepared daily but the methi chutney, made with amchur, sugar and kachari powder (derived from a wild variety of cucumber growing mainly in Rajasthan), has a longer shelf life.Gopal says Katra Neel was an affluent neighbourhood when he opened shop, selling a plate of two tikkis with bread for 25 paise. By the mid-80s, rapid commercialization of the area started driving away the families. Even the smaller bylanes are now filled with shops, and houses have turned into godowns, rues Katra Neels RWA president, Harish Chander Mehra.Mehras second-floor house is adorned with photographs of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru awarding him the first National Gallantry Award as a boy scout.Now 73, Mehra says small businesses such as Gopals chaat shop are a community initiative to help economically weaker sections of society. Gopals tikki now sells for Rs 25 a plate.Resting on a cot at his home, Gopal says long hours of sitting in a cramped space have made his knees weak, forcing him to employ workers to man the prized wicket gate. Were it a full gate, the story would have been different.But he takes immense pride in his children doing well in academics  one is an architect, the other an MBA, the third a graduate in hotel management, and the fourth on way to a PhD. All thanks to a humble snack, lapped up by shoppers on the move."
5904723e7be9e04154df6ea2,Dancing beyond Fidel: Young people in Cuba face an unpredictable future after Castro’s death,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/dancing-beyond-fidel-young-people-in-cuba-face-an-unpredictable-future-after-castros-death/,2016-11-29,"Fidel perched on the side of a swimming pool. Fidel chatting at a party with a woman in a mini dress. His charisma smouldered through the photo frames and across the decades.I came across these photographs from the 1960s casually displayed with other family snaps on the mantelpiece of a retired journalist in Havana. Her father had been the Cuban ambassador to the UN during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.For many of my hosts generation Fidel symbolised the ideals of the 1960s. He stood for freedom in a moment when the US was toppling other Latin American democracies and embarking on the invasion of Vietnam. The magnitude of Fidels stand echoed loudly in these circumstances.I could see Fidels appeal but it didnt carry the same emotional resonance for me and for my Cuban friends, who were all in our early 30s. The idealism of the 60s had dissipated and the achievements of the revolution had become the norm.By 2012, when i visited Cuba, Fidel had handed over the presidency to his younger brother Ral Castro. Change was already underway and it felt like Cuba was edging towards the end of an era.The date stamp on peoples mind for the actual end would come after Fidel. The question everyone was already discussing: After Fidel, what will come next?I was in Havana for a Palestinian-Cuban wedding, officiated by the islands one imam, who later hit the dance floor where his sons band played fast tempo salsa numbers. Rum flowed, cheaper than bottled water. Afterward, the married couple left the party in a fiery red 1955 Pontiac Star Chief convertible.The 1950s seeped through the mambo and rumba tunes, the vintage cars and the posters of Che Guevara, which lined the streets. Fidels image appeared mostly on banners celebrating the 53rd anniversary of the revolution, heralding his transformation of Cuba from a land of wealthy sugar barons to an equitable society.By the 1970s, poverty rates receded, literacy rocketed to almost 100% and health indicators shot up. The development drive was powered by its relationship with the Soviet Union from which Cuba received oil and other subsidies in exchange for sugar. But this came to an end in 1991 with the USSRs collapse.During my stay in Cuba, i heard people still talking about the adverse economic impact of 1991. The standard of living dropped just as a younger generation had started expecting more.Aspirations were on the rise and the attainment of universal education and healthcare were no longer enough.Many young people i met felt that the benefits of the revolution had not filtered down to them. A film director compared the old days of state sponsorship for the arts to the present where subsidies had been cut and private capital was inaccessible.A writer lamented the loss of good Cuban doctors, many of whom the state now exported to Venezuela in return for free oil. An engineer talked of not being able to buy coffee on his salary. A state salary was not enough to enjoy items such as coffee or good quality soap.Acknowledging this, Ral Castro has been slowly opening up the economy. In 2010, private entrepreneurs and small businesses were allowed to set up shop. In 2012, it became legal to buy and sell private property for the first time in 50 years.By 2016, travel restrictions had been eased, internet access had improved and there had been a dramatic breakthrough in US-Cuba relations.The Cuban youth i met wanted the system to open up, for the economy to grow and allow a higher standard of living. But what next after Fidel? This was a matter of debate.On the plus side it could lead to a freer society. On the minus, it could also open the floodgates to Miami Cubans, to American money pouring in, along with the new inequities they might bring.The Cubans i met had their gripes about the government. But they also perceived themselves as better off than some of their Caribbean neighbours, who were still grappling with 1959 levels of inequality.Fidel stood as a barrier between the present and an unpredictable future."
590472b27be9e04154df6f4f,Sweets of Chandni Chowk in Delhi,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/paperweight/60-years-ago-you-could-get-back-your-lost-cash/,2016-12-07,"On this cold, overcast afternoon, Raj Kumars mesh-covered tray seems the brightest spot in entire Chandni Chowk. A pearly white mass sits under the cream, translucent cloth, tantalising passers by like a veiled houri come down from paradise. What is it, everyone wants to know, and the hawker, with remarkable patience, answers each time, Daulat ki chaat (literally, a snack of wealth), jo sirf daulatmand log khate hain(meant solely for the consumption of the wealthy).Seeing that only a third of Kumars little tray has been cleaned out since the morning, I wonder where all of Old Delhis fabled moneybags have gone? After all, isnt this the heart of the Capitals wholesale trade? Perhaps the seths and sethanis have all gone to the hep new McDonalds further down the road, led by their upwardly mobile offspring. So, the old order changeth, placing Kumar and his precious tray at the centre of the curious hoi polloi. And bowing to the times, the daulat ki chaat now retails for a not-so-princely Rs 10 perdauna (a disposable bowl fashioned out of dry leaves), which is, by the way, absolutely eco-friendly as opposed to the Big Macs soft serves in plastic cups.I am in two minds about savouring the delicacy: it appears delicious, but is street food after all, and the last thing I want to court is a Delhi belly. Eventually, caution yields to temptation, and I order a small one. With sugar or without, asks the hawker. It turns out that the chaat itself is made without sugar because, most people in this neighbourhood are diabetic. But hey, whoever said I am from this neighbourhood? Make mine double sweet!The sugar sprinkled over the chaat is called karara and it is a coarsely powdered form of mishri or candy sugar. As soon as the leafy receptacle lands in my hand, I attack the white mass with gusto. But the wooden spoon passes clean through, without the slightest resistance. Casting a surprised glance at the young hawker, I scoop one large chunk of the chaat into my mouth, and it disappears like a lot of airthe most delectably flavoured air. Daulat ki chaat, clearly, is less mithai and more a work of art. But how is it made?The recipe is simple enough. On every clear night, between December and February, Raj Kumar and his guru Hem Chand mix raw (un-boiled) milk and cream in a pot, and place it under the open sky to chill. Then, at 3 am, they start churning the mixture vigorously, so as to raise a lot of froth. And it is this frothregularly removed and collected in a traythat constitutes daulat ki chaat! Ingenious, isnt it? I would make it myself if only I could wake up at 3 am.So, is daulat ki chaat the definitive Delhi mithai? I hope so. When Agra has its petha, Gwalior its gajjak, Ajmer its sohan halwa and Jodhpur its malpuas, its only fair that DelhiImperial capital under the Turks, Afghans, Mughals, British and finally, rightfully, us Indiansshould have something more delicate, refined and superior to represent it in the mithai mart. Madhur Jaffreys Climbing the Mango Trees does seem to suggest that thischaat is native to Delhi, but Raj Kumar is quick to dispel this notion. Its a Banarasi sweet, insists the hawker, an east-UPite himself.Deferring the quest for Delhis elusive native mithai, I move on to a shop that is not only a Delhi institution but also probably the oldest mithai shop in the entire country. Ghantewala, as it is called, claims to have been around since 1790, and one of its many associated legends goes that no less a personage than the Mughal emperor Shah Alam-II christened it. Apparently, there was a school near the shop whose loud ghanta (bell) could be heard right up to the Red Fort. So, every time the emperor yearned for sweets he would order his men to fetch some from the ghantewala! The ghanta has long disappeared, but Ghantewalas fame endures, and the most famous of its sweets today is the sohan halwa, sold by the bagful everyday. Its a crunchy sweet, made from sprouted wheat and assorted nuts. Unlike the large cakes sold in Ajmer, Ghantewalas sohan halwa comes in a more manageable size, and is also tastier, methinks.Across the road from Ghantewala stands Haldirams, a name now familiar all over the country. It represents that mixture of tradition and modernity that yuppie India loves the most. So all day long, you will find its three floors packed with students, young families and tourists. And it does an all-round good jobfrom aloo tikki to gajar halwa, although connoisseurs swear by its rajbhog. Personally, I like its various thickened milks the most. Just a small glassful of the dense, creamy, almond or pistachio flavoured milk can leave you very full, so ideally it shouldnt be had till youre done with Chandni Chowks lighter offerings, like the Bengali mishti at Annapurna Bhandar close by.Established in 1929 by one Mukherjee Babu, Annapurna offers the best Bengali sweets to be found in Delhi. Be it the rasgullas or the less sweet sandesh, kancha golla and ras madhuri, they exceed the expectations of the sternest food critics. If I wished to wind up this trip now, I would order two pieces of thick rasmalai, but my pilgrimage to the Mecca of mithai is not half done yet, so I exit the shop after just a piece of its exquisitegur (jaggery) sandesh.There are other mithai shops and stalls all along Chandni Chowk but leaving them for later, I directly walk to the one furthest awayGiani di Hatti on Church Mission Road. This is where you get the best rabri faluda inDelhi, but on this cold day I would rather have their rich and hot urad dal halwa. Gianis halwa is quite a visual treat. Set in two large troughsone containing the urad dal halwa and the other gajar halwait seems at first sight a mass of nuts and other dry fruits. And the served quantity does live up to the nutty promise. On the way back, my next stop ought to be the venerable Chaina Ram Sindhi halwai (established in 1901) beside the gate of Fatehpuri Masjid. This is said to be the origin of the gummy and chewy Karachi halwa, but the ghee from the urad dal halwa does not permit me to eat anything else just now. Only a digestive is allowedI find it at the old and trusted Pt Ved Prakash Lemonwale. This tiny shop claims to be the birthplace of the banta, the original aerated drink. They sell only sodabranded Shankar Ganga after a family memberin two flavours: lemon and lemon masala. The latter is the digestive that remains in demand till midnight, when most foodies wrap up their trips to Chandni Chowk.Burp! The stomach may be weak but the heart is again willing, and I just cannot deny it a harmless little motichoor laddu at Tewari Brothers, just across the road. Not too sweet, nor chewy, these laddus just melt in the mouth, without leaving behind the cheap taste of vanaspati (hydrogenated vegetable oil). It goes without saying that they are made in pure ghee. And now onto meatier stuff!My next quarry is the market called Kinari Bazaar, tucked away in a lane behind Chandni Chowk and entered either through the famous Parathewali Gali, or Dariba, the jewellers lane. I take the Parathewali Gali, but not before fortifying myself at Kanwarjis, at the street corner. Another of Delhis timeless shops, this one was founded by Lala Kanwar Sen in 1830. And though Chandni Chowk regulars know it by the lamp-lit tray of brilliant imratis set at its counter tip, the shop is most famous for its spicy dal-biji. Its the perfect thing to revive my taste buds, which have become dull under the relentless onslaught of sugar.Kinari Bazaar is a wholesale market for cloth trim, sequins, beads and all other fabric embellishments. So why am I headed there? Quite simply because it houses a shop that prepares khurchana milky marvel not seen elsewhere in Delhi. Could it be one of the lost recipes of the emperors kitchens, Delhis definitive sweet? I am afraid this one, too, is a migrant from west UP.Khurchan, literally, is something scraped offin this case layers of milk boiled down to a flaky texture. And Hazari Lal Jains little shop in Kinari Bazaar has somehow kept the tradition alive in Delhi. Making khurchan is seriously hard work. Starting at 5 in the morning, hundreds of litres of milk is boiled in shallow troughs. After two hours, the milk is reduced to a creamy consistencywhat is known as rabri. Then, another half hour on the flame brings it to an almost solid state, which sticks to the sides of the vessels and needs to be removed with a scraper. Hence the name.Khurchan is expensive because, labour and fuel costs aside, it requires five litres of creamy, undiluted milk to make a kilo of the sweet. Actually, sweet is not the name for it because fresh khurchan only has a plain, creamy taste (which is how it should be had). Sugar is only added to a small part of the days produce to make it palatable to the younger set. Like most of Old Delhis old mithai shops, Hazari Lal Jains also has its associated legends, one of them being that former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee took a boxful of their khurchan for Pakistan premier Nawaz Sharif, when he travelled to Lahore by bus.The khurchan leaves me feeling VERY full, much more than the urad dal halwa. Thats not surprising because just 100 grams of it is equivalent to half a kilo of full cream milk. Luckily, I ate the original, sugar-free version, so my taste buds arent feeling oppressed. With a little determination, I am sure I can still manage one ring of the Dariba Jalebiwalas specialty before pushing off. Oh, theres no way I will go home without some piping hot jalebis!The Jalebiwala is the ultimate Old Delhi institution, singly matching the entire Parathewali Gali in popularity. It was set up in 1880 by Agra resident Nem Chand Jain and today sells 10-15,000 jalebi rings a day. Its a good thing that the day is overcast, drawing the evening crowd in full strength to the Jalebiwalas altar and extending my waiting time to a good 15 minutes. Yes, a plate of jalebi for me, please. No, I think Ill take two, thank you!"
5904737a7be9e04154df70a3,Surging food prices have pushed the wholesale price levels to a 23 month high,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/surging-food-prices-have-pushed-the-wholesale-price-levels-to-a-23-month-high/,2016-08-16,"With good monsoons in the current monsoon season breaking a fairly long period of patchy rainfall and the country soon expecting a bumper crop with farmers going on a sowing spree one would have expected the inflation rates to dip in in anticipation of the coming bounty. Unfortunately for the government and the monetary authorities the reverse seems to be happening with wholesale prices almost doubling in the most recent month even as experts caution the government to be on guard against a crash in commodity prices.Thus the WPI indices show that after a fairly long period of falling prices inflation has suddenly started surging with the increases going up from 0.79% in April to 1.24% in May, 1.62% in June and then finally to 3.55% in July. And commodity prices have largely fuelled the pickup. Price of rice, which has been falling till February this year, is now going up by 4% while that of wheat has moved up by close to 7% for a few months now.Similarly prices of other commodities like pulses, potatoes and fruits are soaring up in double digits some rising above even by as much as 50%. Other products like oil seeds have seen prices slowly crawling up to above 5% in recent months even as that of fibres has shot up by more than a quarter in the most recent month mainly due to the anticipated shortfall in cotton output. Sugar has also been doing badly with prices shooting up by more than a third in July.The surge in prices of important commodities, albeit by varying levels, has caused food prices to more than double over the last three months to 11.82% while that of primary articles has almost trebled to 9.38% over the last four months. There is certainly a concern as these price signals could be transmitted into the other sectors of the economy if they remain unchecked.But then prices of other products in the wholesale price index remain under check. Though commodity prices, especially that of food products, has suddenly shown an upturn the world over the huge excess capacities in heavy industry has ensured that prices of metals and metal products continue to fall and that prices of minerals remain far below the peak levels. The trends are also reflected in fuel and power. All this could neutralise the negative trends and hopefully contain the overall impact of the surge in food and commodity prices to some extent.Interestingly the pickup in commodity prices has been followed by a slow increase in manufactured good prices which turned positive in March this year and then slowly edged up to 1.82% by July. A deeper investigation shows that this is more likely to be a cost push inflation as it has been fuelled by an increase in prices of food products, sugar, edible oil and beverages. In fact the surge in cotton prices seems to have even pushed up prices of cotton textiles after many months of decline.Prices increases in most other manufactured goods, like wood, paper, leather, rubber and chemical products however remain sticky at the lower end. Only in case of cement has there been any significant improvement in prices after a long time. Prices of other important manufactured products like machinery and machine tools and transport equipment has almost remained stable for an extended period now. Thus one can say that the huge excess capacities in large segments of manufacturing will help contain the overall impact of any surge in commodity and food prices on the WPI to some extent."
590473a87be9e04154df70d8,"Who owns rosogolla, does it matter?",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-n-style/who-owns-rosogolla-does-it-matter/,2016-08-31,"During the weekend at my cousins place, the dinner included rosogollas. As most Indians know, rosogolla holds an esteemed place in any Bengali feast or dessert spread. In my school days, when I attended any wedding in Kolkata, I remember kids routinely boasted about how many of these spongy delights they could eat at one go.Amid tug of war with Bengal over its origin, Odisha recently celebrated Rasgulla Day. My opinion is whether its Bengal or Odisha does it matter who owns rosogolla. People across the globe are just thrilled with these yummiest, softest, melt-in-mouth delights. Actually these cheese dumplings dipped in lightly flavoured sugar syrup are a delight in itself.In fact this time my cousin-sister has served the rosogollas with fresh red cherries by its side. Well they looked so good that once again I have fallen in love with rosogollas.In her book Eating India Chitrita Banerji writes about rosogolla: It is supposed to have been invented (perhaps through a happy accident) by a nineteenth-century confectioner named Nobin Chandra Das, whose son, KC Das, opened the eponymous Calcutta shop in the 1930s.Chitrita writes further, Like most Bengalis, I had always assumed that these and other channa-based sweets had evolved out of the regional imagination, until I came across the theory that the Bengalis had learned to make them from the Portuguese who settled around the Bay of Bengal in the 17th century.Though the basic recipe remains the same, yet each establishment today has its own distinct style of preparing the rosogolla. What may, I can say that for any Bengali, there is no sincerer love than the love for rosogollas.I have forever been in love with rosogolla. The best so far has been the warm, nolen-gur rosogolla from a nondescript shop in a bylane of South Kolkatas Purna Das Road. Fresh off the kadai, they are too spongy to be cut by a flimsy wooden spoon, so I choose the easiest way out. I pick up an entire piece and put it in my mouth. It causes an explosion in my mouth. But it is not that of overwhelming sweetness or artificial sponginess; it is strong, slightly chewy, and not too sweet. In a matter of seconds, it dissolves in my mouth, leaving behind a lingering flavour. As I reach for the other, and another, I realize food, in the end, whether its rosogolla or so to say any other, is a tradition, something holy. Its not about who owns. Its about sharing.Long live rosogolla!"
590473fe7be9e04154df716a,The countdown has begun,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/first-person/the-countdown-has-begun/,2016-08-29,"I am back from Apollo Group of Hospitals in Chennai with a MELD (The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score of 22.This is an internationally-accepted objective measure of how urgently a patient needs a liver transplant within the next three months. The score ranges from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill). Based on the lab values of Bilirubin (a measure of how effectively my liver is excreting bile); INR (how effectively its clotting blood) and Creatinine (my kidney function), MELD helps hospitals and governments agencies monitoring liver donation prioritize patients waiting for a transplant.I am O+, which means I am a universal donor, but when it comes receiving blood products or a liver, I am at a disadvantage. I dont have antigens A or B, which makes me a rare blood group type. So, in order to prevent the tumor in my cirrhotic liver from growing at its current alarming speed, I need to undergo Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). During TACE, the radiology team will administer drugs into my hepatic artery to kill the tumor. A non-invasive procedure, it will buy me three months wait period.The wait list at a multi-speciality hospital is a dynamic list, where a patients name rises and falls every week, depending upon the number of cadavers received, matched (as per the recipients blood group, weight etc) and the physical availability of the patient.It made sense for me to register at two hospitals in Mumbai (Jupiter and Kokilaben) and 5 Apollo Group hospitals in Chennai, where I have to rush to within three-four hours flight time  for thats how long the hospital can keep a cadaver liver alive. There are others in the line-up at Apollo Chennai, which, I realize has turned into a cadaver capital of the world, with patients flying in from across the globe.At the hospital that receives a cadaver from the Zonal Transplant Co-ordination Centre (ZTCC), a not-for-profit government agency, the medical team calls the first three patients on the wait list and if, God forbid, the first happens to be running fever, the second is unable to arrange funds, the three is unable to make it to the hospital in the given time slot, the liver will be assigned to the fourth patient.The name shuffle also happens if, during the interim, the patient on the wait list dies, or receives his transplant at another hospital, where he was higher up on the list. I am at No.#2 to No#5 on the four hospital lists, Ive chosen to register with.To be on the active list, Ive had to pay a fee (anything between Rs 5000 to Rs 60,000 at each hospital) that is re-fundable if I dont end up taking the liver from that hospital, or pop off, in the meanwhile.Therefore, I must keep my bags ready, my funds liquid, my sagging spirit high, and remain in the best of physical fitness and mental health to stay in the race and be able to answer the hospital call anytime of the day or night. I am now the mistress of my destiny.While my family is assisting me in the funds department, I have to concentrate on keeping enough work in the pipeline at www.writesolutions.co to have my fledgling content development practice running, my kitchen fires burning, and be able to overall support my aged father and my young daughter survive the crisis, during the two months post-surgical recuperation. As the sole bread earner of my family, I must live or die in harness.Since my cirrhotic liver is not allowing me to make or store adequate amount of proteins and have begun to lose weight, in order to remain in a fighting fit condition in preparation of my surgery, my dietitian has advised six egg whites a day, lots of fish, milk, pulses, soya and fresh fruits, and advised me to switch to a no fats, no oil, no sodium (salt), low sugar diet. Eat like a baby, frequent, small meals, bland, mashed and cooked well, she said, or you can end up cannibalizing your weak muscles.Meanwhile, Ive also been issued a strict exercise regiment by my physiotherapist  if you want to bounce back on your feet quickly and not stay on the vent for longer than a day, he cheered.I broke down during my psychiatric evaluation, so the shrink had to re-schedule it for another day. Get a grip on yourself, my good natured bro-in-law chided. You dont want this to be a hurdle, he winked and I understood the pointlessness of being vulnerable, when I have such limited options. Surely, I want a second shot at life?Since, I have severe edema (fluid retention in my legs) due to the malfunctioning liver, Ive been advised to restrict my fluid intake to 1 liter a day (max), and have a diuretic to flush out the excess fluid build-up. The daily ablutions should be normal, so exercise daily my physio warned.As I walked into my home-cum-office today morning, my daughter greeted me with, Did you take pictures in Chennai, Mama? and before I could find a suitable answer, my concerned intern chimed in, Did you find a cadaver, Maam?Sometimes, I dont know whether to laugh or cry at the ghoulish tale, unfolding in my life.Why me? I want to ask my God.And then the answer comes, Why not me?"
590474017be9e04154df7170,The internally displaced,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/stepping-out/the-internally-displaced/,2016-08-22,"India has a long history with refugees since time immemorial  be it the Parsis fleeing persecution from the Middle East since the 7th century; the Tibetans finding sanctuary for their government in exile in 1959; or the recently increasing Afghan and Baloch immigrants looking for a safe haven, far away from the wars and occupation of their countries/regions, or the famine-plagued, flood-ravaged Bangladesh immigrants settled in and around Ferozabad since the 1970s. While traveling all over India you find many Nepali citizens integrated into the ethos of the country with their Gurkha features, ready smiles and their capacity to do hard work with anything given to them.What is not much known is that India is also a host to its internally displaced people who are refugees in their own country. The country also provides pockets of safe spaces for its oppressed who are repressed by the bigotry of their respective religions and culture and yearn for a secular, liberal way of life. The yearning for freedom is their aspirations to be accepted for their talents and abilities rather than be judged all the time for their ethnicity, caste or their religion. The Constitution of India has that one word SECULAR, which guarantees religion to be kept separate from the public life and ensures those safe spaces or the quest of one.Some of the oppressed spend their lives looking for such spaces or pockets of freedom  the ever, eternal desplazados  some find them, some dont. I am one of them.Of course, India isnt exactly the paradise or safe haven that all seek. Its track record in its treatment towards Dalits isnt exactly humane in practice, though the law of the land may guarantee it. The safety of women has lately been a huge blot on the ethos of its culture and image of tolerance and equality. It will be a long, long time before minorities feel safe within its boundaries with the extremist Hindutva forces rising with impunity. Yet for all the negatives that India has to face and bear and account for, there are millions of people thankful that it is built on secular and socialist values rather than theocracy and religion as the guiding light.The immigrant experience has always been about building new lives, working hard and keeping their noses inside the boundaries of the law. Be it the first wave of Irish immigrants to Ellis Island in New York or the initial Muslim families related to the Prophets grandson Hussain seeking sanctuary in India while fleeing persecution and invited by the Hindu king Raja Dahir. The immigrants always enrich the culture of the land that gave them sanctuary, stability, and opportunities to rebuild their lives amidst brotherhood and companionship. The Afghan refugee students will testify to this in any Indian University.With the increasing phobia about immigrants in the West justifiably because of the actions of a few, it becomes pertinent that the immigrant experience whether from abroad or of the internally displaced within is refined and understood, so that no untoward ill feeling or hatred develops in communities. With the ever errant and chest thumping neighbor threatening jihad from across, it becomes all the more important that immigrants be understood and integrated within the subcontinents fabric and their dissenting voices, all secular and liberal voices should be given a space to provide a perspective and reflection of what ails their place of origin.As a Kashmiri in a Hindu land and what is easily seen as betrayal, as a collaborator with the enemy, as a traitor to the cause back home, epithets and slander thrown around as easily as bullets, grenades and acid from back home, it is important to realize the risk, the danger, the atmosphere of insecurity that fascism and persecution of minorities can provide for the internally displaced as well. Every desplazado wants to contribute and give back in every which way as possible and it is up to the majoritarian communities to hear them, to extend friendship with them and to give them space for their experiences.Just like secular liberal people in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and other Muslim majority countries are resisting bigotry, theocracy, fundamentalism, extremism, Salafism, the same way India too has a counter resistance to the growing repression of its minorities with secular Hindus at the forefront of it. The ethos of India has been found in the Zoroastrian apocryphal legend which relates the course of the initial meeting between Jadi Rana and the newly landed emigrants: When the Zoroastrians requested asylum, Jadi Rana, a local king motioned to a vessel of milk filled to the very brim to signify that his kingdom was already full and could not accept refugees. In response, one of the Zoroastrian priests added a pinch of sugar to the milk, thus indicating that they would not bring the vessel to overflowing and indeed make the lives of the citizens sweeter. Jadi Rana gave shelter to the emigrants and permitted them to practice their religion and traditions freely.India might not have a Statue of Liberty with Emma Lazarus famous sonnet dedicated to its huddled masses yearning to breathe free but the Indian ethos has always been true to her words:Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,With conquering limbs astride from land to land;Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall standA mighty woman with a torch, whose flameIs the imprisoned lightning, and her nameMother of Exiles. From her beacon-handGlows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes commandThe air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp! cries sheWith silent lips. Give me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
590474307be9e04154df71ba,Why the “fat” and “sugar” tax supporters have got it wrong,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/why-the-fat-and-sugar-tax-supporters-have-got-it-wrong/,2016-07-12,"Do fat taxes or sugar taxes punish all consumers in an attempt to nudge some consumers towards moderating their consumption? Are these taxes an indiscriminate response to lifestyle changes that span far more than changes in the kind of calories consumed?Kerala recently introduced a fat tax in its budget by picking on burgers, pizzas, tacos, doughnuts, sandwiches, burger patties, pasta and bread-fillings for a 14% tax. The main aim, according to Kerala government bureaucrat, was to use tax as a tool to serve public health needs.A few months ago, UK introduced a sugar tax in its budget which was aimed at fizzy beverages in particular.Typically, public health campaigners support such taxes. But are they justified? For sure, their intentions are right, but have diagnosed the problem correctly?India does not have the kind of granular data at household level which can provide enough information to take a call. But UKs data is rich enough to identify the causes of growing obesity in that society with a lot more accuracy.Two researchers in UK, Rachel Griffith and Melanie Luhrmann, used UK governments household surveys spread over 30 years (1980 to 2013) to get a sense of food spending. They found that calories purchased had declined over that period.The daily calorie intake per adult in UK had declined from 2,892 to 2,261. Despite a decline in calorie intake, obesity had grown as a problemGriffith and Luhrmann then compared the strenuousness of paid work over a similar time period in search of an answer. They found that there was a shift towards more sedentary occupations and concluded that overall, we see that declines in physical activity at market work and in other activities has largely counteracted the reduction in calories.Griffith and Luhrmann, however, did not advocate curtailing UKs sugar tax.But it is worth looking at this information to see if it is relevant to India. Anecdotally, there is evidence of a shift towards a more sedentary lifestyle in India. There has also been a shift in urban areas in particular towards more sugary or fried food.If we assume that the UK trend in both calorie intake and strenuousness of work are today being replicated in India, does it make sense to tax every single consumer to neutralize the impact of change in lifestyle in terms of physical activity?In the absence of robust granular evidence in India, it may be reasonable to assume that the extent of physical activity is falling fast. This fall may well be the main cause for a lot of problems. If this assumption sounds reasonable, why should fat and sugary foods be made more expensive for everyone, including those whose level of physical activity has not fallen in recent times?The sugar and fat tax advocates in India may have got things upside down."
590474457be9e04154df71dc,Nothing Gandhian about prohibition in Gujarat; it’s a British legacy,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/true-lies/nothing-gandhian-about-prohibition-in-gujarat-its-a-british-legacy/,2016-05-31,"I lived in Moscow for seven long years from 1986 to 1993 as Patriot correspondent, and travelled almost all corners of the ex-Soviet Union  from its Far-Eastern cities to its northern most port Arkhangelsk, many of the Central Asian towns which were later ravaged by internecine ethnic clashes and, of course, the cultural capital, St Petersburg. Yet, what surprises many of my acquaintances and friends is, how couldnt I learn to give up my essentially teetotal characteristic?Even the doyen of Indian diplomats, TN Kaul, couldnt change me during his ambassadorship in Moscow. At embassy parties, not once, but several times over he would approach me, saying, This is bad, Rajiv! You must at least hold a glass of wine! I would obey, hold the glass till the toast was over, and abandon it immediately thereafter.Not that I havent ever sipped alcohol. During informal gatherings in Moscow, I did indeed taste home-made wine, as also Georgian and Moldavian wine, rated pretty high. I have also tasted koniak, scotch whisky, rum, and of course vodka However, strangely, I couldnt ever develop a liking for any of them. Id rather prefer fruit juice. And there wasnt anything moral about it either. For, I didnt disdain those who would drink.Once I tried discussing this with a Russian scholar, political scientist and Indologist, known for his non-conformist views, Prof Eric Komarov. And he gave me an interesting explanation. He said, drinking in Russia is part of ones cultural habit, a way of life. I still cant forget what he told me once when I visited his house, situated on way to the Sheremetyevo International Airport: Voda in Russian means water We affectionately call daughter (devushka in Russian) as dochka, similarly mother mamuchka, and father papuchka. So, when we call it vodka, we are just giving a special word for voda or water Its just an expression of our sheer love to drink.I am reminded of this view of Komarov, who became an excellent source of information of Soviet affairs during those turbulent days, as and when someone talks of prohibition in Gujarat. Ever since he told this to me, I have, ironically, tried explaining my refusal to drink liquor as a matter of habit, something which I got from my Gandhian parents. But with the fever of prohibition now traveling far and wide from Gujarat to Kerala, Bihar and Tamil Nadu, I am left wondering if this explanation has received a setback.Yet I have, willy nilly clung to the view that habit is part of culture, a way of life. Imposing prohibition cannot erase it; it would remain in ones subconscious. This is as much true of beef, sought to be banned under religious pretext.Recently, when I was talking about this to a well-known Gujarat-based sociologist, Prof Vidyut Joshi, I recalled two studies which, I was told by a senior official in Gandhinagar, were authored by him in 1978. These studies are on the impact of prohibition in Surats rural and urban areas. The studies, I was told, were classified, possibly because it pointed towards why going tipsy in the South Gujarat region was historically more a way of life, a part of culture, which shouldnt have been abandoned.Refusing to part with the studies, what Prof Joshi, however, told me was revealing: Prohibition, he told me, was not imposed by Gujarat rulers, even though they may claim it to be a Gandhian legacy initiated after the state became independent of the Bombay State in 1960. It is a legacy we have received from the British rulers since 1888, he said, adding, More as a desire to control the liquor market, the British allowed only that liquor to be sold which was manufactured by the government. It gave license to sell liquor to those whom it trusted, many of whom happened to be Parsis. Descendants of those who had these licenses have surnames like Batliwala, Daruwala, Tadiwala.He further said, Before this happened, the tribals in South Gujarat were used to drinking mahua, extracted from flowers of mahua trees, found aplenty in eastern hilly region of Gujarat. They would mix mahua in chapati and sweets. Mahua flowers would be used to incense water. Tribals formed 50 per cent of the South Gujarat population.Similarly, he said, Tadi was extracted from palm trees along the sea shore, where 15 to 20 per cent of of the South Gujarat population lived. They are mainly fisherfolk  Khervas, Machchis, Tandels, Naviks and Kolis. Fishermen would have to remain in the sea for several days, often weeks, and tadi used to be their only pastime during the highly unorganized life they lived. Other communities which had a strong tendency to drink, as part of their way of life, were Ranas, Kshatriyas, Ghanchis and Parsis.Pointing out that the problem illicit liquor replaced as an affordable means to release tension after the British banned mahua and tadi, Prof Joshi said, Slurry would arrive from sugar mills in far off Uttar Pradesh in railway wagons. It was needed for quick fermentation. Similarly, the denatured spirit used in dyes in cotton mills began being used to make hooch.Highly dangerous for health, Prof Joshi said, I asked a worker in Surat city why did he drink such liquor which would shorten his life span. And his reply was: Even otherwise we live in a hell It is better to die in five years by enjoying this drink.While Prof Joshi didnt elaborate on the studies he had carried out on prohibition in South Gujarat, saying these remain classified, I vividly remember what the government official, who saw it as part of his effort to understand how liquor would or would not affect peoples life, had told me. The studies are based on more than 200 interviews of the poorer sections in six villages of Surat district and Surat city.Carried out during Prof Joshis stint at the South Gujarat University, the studies  titled Benefits of Prohibition  A Comparative Study of Drinkers and Non-Drinkers in Rural South Gujarat and Benefits of Prohibition  A Comparative Study of Drinkers and Non-Drinkers in Surat City, sponsored by the Department of Prohibition and Excise, Government of Gujarat  found no significant difference in the economic life between drinkers and non-drinkers in both rural and urban areas, and recommended temperance  lifting of the ban on mahua and tadi.While this was the first attempt to recommend lifting prohibition, albeit partially, during my nearly 14 years interaction with Gujarat government officials in Gandhinagar, I havent come across even one bureaucrat, including some of those who serve in the Prime Ministers Office today, who favour prohibition. Taking an elitist view of prohibition, the thinking has been strong that it has been a major hurdle in developed Gujarats movement towards cosmopolitanism. Frequent attempts were made, albeit unsuccessful, to have a tourism policy, which allowed liquor to be allowed at sea resorts.There was even a recommendation of a casino near the Harappan site of Dholavira in Kutch district in the state-sponsored Blueprint for Infrastructure in Gujarat: Vision 2020, as part of the effort to develop entertainment industry in Gujarat. The entire portion was withdrawn soon after I wrote a story on it. A senior Modi aide explained to me, The chief minister is aware of the need to lift prohibition. But he is helpless. He cannot lift prohibition, even partially, otherwise there would be political backlash.Strange though it may seem, no policy maker in Gujarat has sought to find out what could the social reasons behind poor people consuming spurious liquor, which has become a norm, whether it is semi-urban areas off Ahmedabad or Gandhis birthplace Porbandar. It has led to major hooch tragedies, such as the one in Ahmedabad in 2009, in which 139 people died. Prof Joshis studies are not the only ones which suggest need to allow drinking as a matter of choice. A similar study was carried out, with almost the same conclusions, by the Sardar Patel Institute for Social and Economic Research, Ahmedabad, which once was a major seat of learning, founded by top academic Prof TD Lakdawala in 1965.Studies in US on prohibition imposed in 1920s replicate whats true of Gujarat today. Pointing towards negative impact of prohibition, they point towards how alcohol became more dangerous to consume; organized crime blossomed; courts and prisons systems became overloaded; and endemic corruption of police and public officials occurred.However, who cares for such studies, even if these may help one arrive at a reasonable solution?"
590474797be9e04154df721b,Trends in progress of sown area of khariff crops shows that it will be difficult to meet targets,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/trends-in-progress-of-sown-area-of-khariff-crops-shows-that-it-will-be-difficult-to-meet-targets/,2016-08-18,"The numbers released by ministry of agriculture just before the advance of the southwest monsoons targeted a 7.1% increase in total food grain production in 2016-17. Both khariff and rabi grain output was expected to go up by the same extent to push up total food grain production to 270.1 million tons. This was indeed an ambitious target as it would require that the increase in food grain production be stepped up to the highest level in the last five years.However, the progress of the khariff sowing season has lent hopes that the grain production this year would match the ambitious targets laid out by the government. Numbers released for the period up to the middle of August shows that the sown area in the current khariff season has touched 954 lakh hectares which is 6.5% higher than the sown area in the corresponding period of the same previous year.However, the increase in the sown area has been uneven across the major states. Among the four states with the largest sown area, and which account for close to half the total sown area in the country, only Maharashtra had registered a sizable 15% increment in gross cropped area. One reason for this may be the increase in states rainfall, which went up close to a quarter during the current season.However, the total sown area in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, the other major states with the maximum sown area, have remained largely stable. This is surprising because the increase in rainfall in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has been higher than in Maharashtra. Among other states with extensive cultivation Karnataka, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh have also registered a substantial increase in the gross sown area in the current season.But a crop wise investigation of the trends in the progress of the total sown area shows that increase has not been in proportion to the targets set in case of many crops. In fact only in the case of rice and pulses has been the increase in sown area been commensurate with the production targets set. So while the agriculture ministry targets has set that the khariff rice crop be increased by 2.7% and the pulse production be raised by 32.1% the sown area for these crops has increased by 7% and 33.2% so far which indicates that the targets can hopefully be achieved.But in case of other crops the increase in sown area has not been very significant. For instance in the case of coarse cereals and oil seeds the ministry has targeted 16.4% and 36.5% increase in khariff output. However, the trends in the progress of the sown area so far shows that sown area has so far only increased by 6% and 5.1% respectively. To achieve the targeted increase in output the productivity of these crops has to go up substantially in both cases.However, the worst case scenario is seen in the commercial crops like sugar cane and cotton. The targets set out by the ministry would expect sugarcane and cotton output to increase by 2.4% and 17.9% respectively. However, the trends in the sown area indicate that the crop under sugar cane has declined by 8% while that under cotton has fallen by 8.9%. That would make the achievement of the targets difficult if not impossible in the current season.So the overall assessment is that while the good monsoons has improved the prospects of achieving the target set for important crops like rice and pulses it does not seem to have very much improved the prospects of others like coarse cereals, oilseeds, sugar cane and cotton. The country has to roll out more innovative programs to improve productivity of important crops if it is the raise agriculture output to much higher levels."

Finally, a very dear friend (Seema) asked me to write a follow up to my last post about easily doable tips on nutrition & habits for the frequent flier club. It got me thinking about how my sisters, friends, colleagues and even I travel so often that we tend to resign ourselves to our food fate so to speak.At first, the whole jet setting concept is very appealing, but like a cheap piece of imitation jewelry, it quickly loses its sheen for most (business) travellers. The excitement is quickly replaced by groans about only stopping over to change bags, etc. With that comes the added burden of having to eat heavy, unhealthy food most of the time because one is either running and can only grab the sugar and fat overloaded snacks at airports or one is entertaining/being entertained at business lunches/dinners and miss the chance to eat healthy.I have had clients who crave simple home made food so much that they cried tears of joy when they finally got to eat ghar ka khana even though their cook at the time was atrocious!! So how does one manage to be a jet setter and still stay on track?Irrespective of how crazy your work is (trust me, I come from a family of overachievers who have been jet-setting before it was even in vogue) you have to make some time for yourself. Easier said than done, I know, but POSSIBLE. Below are my to dos:1. Pack a set of workout clothes/swimming gear + good pair of sneakers, also check out the facilities available at the hotel youll be staying.2. For snacks (I have the entire gamut of clients  pure vegetarian, vegans, lactose/gluten intolerant & those wholl eat anything that moves), my advice  carry something healthy you love, your go to  eg. Nuts.3. Wake up 30 minutes earlier than normal & go workout  swim/run/cross train /jump rope & stretch  even the Phys Ed stuff we did in school works brilliantly.4. Golden rule  stay well hydratedall that air travel & artificial environment isnt good for ones skin & mental focus. Always keep a water bottle handy & sip it every 30 minutes.5. Breakfast should be something filling yet healthyoats/cereal/granola/eggs/fruit. Avoid sweet, sugary, processed breads etc.6. Pack a fruit + a little cheese at breakfastsnack on it in a couple of hours.7. Never skip lunch. Keep it light and simplesomething that gives you nutrients you need for proper brain functioning without sugar highs & subsequent crashes. Soups and salads (dressing on the side please), light wraps or steamed vegetables/rice, etc work well.8. 1-2 meals should be eaten between breakfast and lunch & lunch and dinner. Keep sugar to a minimum in tea/coffee. Preferably a glass of fresh juice or coconut water once out of those 2 meals.9. Unsalted almonds/walnuts/peanuts/roasted rice crispies/channa for snacking.10. Dinners similar to lunch with less bread/rice. Rosted/lightly sauteed steak (cottage cheese/chicken/fish fillet/tofu) with vegetables.11. Im not on the eat dinner before 7 bandwagon. Consultants rarely sleep early. They end up working late so their bodies & brains need sustained energy for longer. A cup of milk about 45-60 minutes before bedtime is fine.12. Paradoxic as it sounds try and get as much sleep as possible & avoid reaching out for processed and packaged food.13. Alcohol if unavoidable, should be had slowly & spaced out with plenty of water in between. Smoking should be completely avoided.And there you have it! Happy travelling"
590474c97be9e04154df7297,Hate is religion,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/dev-vani/hate-is-religion/,2016-07-24,"For years I wanted to know why I would feel uncomfortable in front of overtly religious people especially the ones whose tongues would never stop wagging about how deeply religious they were.Or why I could not relate to the deeply conservative norms which they believed were their path to salvation as prescribed in various religious scriptures or customs.In Pakistan, a Mullah shouted from the top of a Minaret in a Masjid that Islam was in danger and it was time to launch a religious Jihad against the infidels and Lo! A herd appeared from nowhere, ready to butcher and sacrifice their lives in the name of Islam.In India, a Pandit cried at the top of his voice how it was time to take revenge for the mother cows perceived killing and Lo! People came out in droves to burn the non-followers alive, all in the name of saving the Hinduism.In USA, a pastor shouted how Jesus was the true son of God and Bible the only true holy Book and Lo! Men and women from the civilized society did not blink an eye setting Quran on fire in order to cleanse their nation and save Christianity.Religion was built on the principles of universal love and brother hood. Manu, Krishna, Dayanand, Jesus, Mohammad, Nanak, Buddha, all spoke of compassion and acceptance.But their followers, who accepted their words as holy gospel and developed religious boundaries out of them, focused more on preserving the respective domains and the names of their prophets than their teachings.Taking pride in being a Hindu and maintaining Hindu traditions has become more important than being a Hindu. The same is true for others.Alas in the real world it turns out that when you chose one religion, you automatically tend to denounce the other. A Hindu cannot be a Muslim or a Christian or vice versa. You become captive of one domain.Religion gives you the power and surprisingly a right to hate others who differ.A Muslim can be most pious and yet be ready to kill the infidels. A Hindu can be devout and yet at the same time preach to eradicate the nation of its Muslim population. A Christian can be God fearing and yet be ready to ban all Muslims from entering the soil that he treads on.The more religious acts you perform and the more you feel that you are getting closer to your chosen God, the more powerful you become in your eyes. This also enables you to develop more venom towards the person who does not see eye to eye with your chosen God.Eureka! I knew exactly the cause of my discomfort with religion.Religion as is practiced today, can only lead to hate! Hate is the necessary by-product.For decades and centuries, religious and political leaders, kings, power mongers and even the elite knew this and have used religion as a tool to define boundaries, divide and rule over people.They knew that fear is the key and have mixed the brew of fear and hate as sugar and salt dissolved in the holy water of religion for people to drink and lose their senses. Today even this masking is not required and they carry out their agenda out in the open. Blatant and straight!Hate is the new religion!The true religion of the successful leader! The true religion of the real believer! World over!You have to hate someone to be truly religious. It is the primary test.The hate could be between Hindus or Muslims or Christians or Jews. It could be between Whites or Blacks or coloured. It could be between straights and gays.Hate creeps everywhereclass, caste, colour, creed, kind, gender, religion and has no boundaries.Hate is well and truly universal.The Trumps of the world, know it clearly. They may reside in the rich lands of USA, or among the leaders of various political parties of India, or even in the troubled lands of the Middle East.Trump is only following in the footsteps of the great leaders who have used Hate and fear to capture the imagination of their people. Be it the Islamic forces of the Middle East or Pakistan or even the Hindutava brigade in India.Trumps message of Make America hate again is just more loud and on the face.Will he succeed? Do you want him to succeed? The answer lies in how you see the Muslim who lives in a ghetto in your own city because you may not really be willing to accept him as your own.The modern man is trying hard to break free from this most powerful religion of hate by the liberating powers of education, knowledge and scientific temperament.It is a tough battle being fought on the streets of Toronto where a Treudeau sings and dances in the Pride parade or offers Ardas, in the speeches and thoughts of true leaders like Obama, Aga Khan and Dalai Lama, in the defiance of a Kulkarni in India, or even in the silent outcry of millions like us who feelenough is enough.We are not going to leave a world for our children where religion and hate are synonym.If need be, we will break away from religions themselves. We will create a new world with no walls.In our new world there will be no differentiators of being Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Muslims, straights, gays, poor, rich, Brahmin, Shudra.. We will follow no past dead scriptures, believe in no superstitions, have no kalams or psalms to recite or mantras to chant or even no Vastu or Grahas to fear. We would have no love limited to a particular sect and hence no hate for others. We would have created no God to die for and no God to fear. In fact there will be no words as hate or fear!Is this too much of a utopian dream? To be just human and nothing more!In your answer lies the future of humanity. And the true essence of our knowledge and learning!"
590475267be9e04154df7317,Let no fad break this bread and butter bond,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/musings-from-the-mountains/let-no-fad-break-this-bread-and-butter-bond/,2016-07-31,"As a light snack nothing could be simpler or more satisfying than a slice of bread and butter, a combination that has been the staple of my diet for the better part of my 80-plus years on planet Earth. And now I am told by the dietary specialists and fitness faddists that bread and butter are bad for me; bread, because of some chemical that goes into its making or baking, and butter because it is nothing but saturated fat or transfat or transgender fat or something along those lines which only leads to more fat around the waistline.You have a fatty heart, I was told by a specialist some 50 years ago, when I was living in New Delhi. Well, I still have my fatty heart, although I no longer live in New Delhi, and my waistline is as undulating as the hills upon which I now dwell.Stop eating bread and butter, says my dietary adviser. It will shorten your life.Should I switch to parathas? I ask. I rather like the thought of stuffed paranthas for breakfast.Thats even worse! she screams at me. Next thing, youll be wanting pure ghee to go with them.So what do I have for breakfast? No flour, no butter, no flour, no ghee.You can have dhalia.Whats that? I ask. I thought the dahlia was a flower.Dhalia is a form of oats. They call it porridge in England. Scottish people eat it.But Scotland wants to separate from the UK, so perhaps theyll give up porridge.Actually, I remembered dhalia from my boarding school days in Shimla, when we used to confront it at breakfast time. It was rather insipid stuff, I recall, and most of us would make it palatable by adding jam or sweetened condensed milk. These things came in tins in those days, and the jams were all made by a company called JB Mangharam. I wonder what happened to JB Mangharams many fine condiments. They disappeared by the late 1950s.Anyway, the other day I found a bowl of dhalia placed before me at breakfast time. As expected, it tasted like sand (organic of course) dug up from the beach. So I reached for the sugar bowl.No sugar, said my dietary adviser. Thats white poison.So I reached for the jam pot.No jam! she screamed. Thats fifty percent sugar!So I reached for the salt-cellar.No salt, no salt! Your blood pressure will shoot up!Maybe I could have some mango pickle, just to give it a little flavour?Pickle is full of salt!I grew rebellious and refused to eat the dhalia. You can give me a plain chappati, I said, sulking.My dietary adviser very generously allowed me a plain chappati. When my adviser wasnt looking, I helped myself to a little butter. It looked lovely, spread on that lovely chappati. The front-door bell rang, and my adviser went to see who was ringing.Illustration credit: Chad CroweQuickly, I attacked the pickle bottle, extracted a couple of green chillies, tucked them into my buttered chappati and hurriedly consumed the lot. It made a great chilli-rissole.Unfortunately Id swallowed one chilli too many, and as a result I was hiccupping for most of the day. Pip-pip-pip! On at least two occasions my dietary adviser mistook my hiccups for the signal on her cellphone. This only sharpened her dietary zeal, and for lunch I was given pea soup and what may have been granulated sunflower seeds. Organic of course.She left in the afternoon to give a lecture on healthy eating in one of our premier schools, and I made a beeline for the kitchen and helped myself to bread and butter and strawberry jam, and washed it all down with tea made with condensed milk. At least it stopped the hiccups.Even when I was a kid, my grandmother did not allow me to enter the kitchen. She maintained that pickle and chutneys heated the blood, and mince-pies were bad for the brain. As a result I would sneak across to our neighbour, a dear old lady who fed me meringues and lemon tarts; and I like to think that the things I have really enjoyed have helped to sustain me into a reasonably contented old age.Note: For those who are unfamiliar with a meringue, its made of egg whites beaten up with sugar, then baked to a crisp. Delicious!"

Our languages are replete with idioms calling for a sugary response to every auspicious occasion  from exhortations of muh meetha karna (sweeten ones mouth) when someone brings good news, to aap ke muh mein ghee shakkar (clarified butter and sugar in your mouth) when someone speaks well of a situation.Every festive occasion, from Diwali to Eid to Christmas, sees India on a sugar high. There is a good reason for this. Sugar is believed to have taken root first in India. There is a reference to sugarcane cultivation in the Vedas, and the words sugar and jaggery are both derived from the Sanskrit sarkara.Indians were storing crystallised and granulated sugar when the army of Alexander the Great arrived on the shores of Indus in 327 BC. Surprised to see a sweet alternative to honey, they described sugarcane as a reed that gives honey without bees. From the Persian shakkar to the Spanish azucar sugar trails have led out of India.But the buzz over sugar and belittling of fat is ending across the world, and it is back to full-fat milk and honey.Word out of medical science is that fat has been framed and unfairly tossed into the fire. Apparently, our ghee-whiz grandmas were right; there is much to recommend in fat, including clarified butter.Many physicians, such as UK cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra, have had a change of heart and have been rebelling against what they were taught in med school. Some fats, such as those naturally occurring in dairy, nuts, fish (salmon and sardine), avocado, etc are actually beneficial to health.The real demon turns out to be sugar. Much of it comes stealthily through starch from refined grains and sodas (soft drinks) that have swept over our diets. Sugar in fact is being described as the new smoking.Subverted in the 60s with the eclipse of indigenous coarse grains (finger millet, barley, oats, etc) the Indian diet  now carb-rich and sugar-heavy  has settled into our hips and midriff as fat (under instruction from the hormone insulin), to make us the world leaders in diabetes and heart disease. The fat is truly in the fire.So the Kerala governments move to impose a fat tax  which should more accurately be called starch tax or junk food tax  on food items such as pizzas, burgers and tacos, is essentially a step in the right direction. As with most such well-intentioned moves in India, it is half-assed, incomplete and misdirected. Just as it takes more than an odd- and-even licence plate traffic scheme to reduce congestion and pollution on Indias roads, it needs more than a tax on starch and sugar to get India healthy.Why just pizza and burgers of which there are healthy versions? Why not samosas and parathas, some of which can be as lethal? And if they can make the cut, what about pooris and bhaturas, cakes and pastries? And what about sugar itself, which our halwais and sweet meat experts so generously lace on top of refined flours and trans fat to make our arteries thicken and pulses quicken?Various countries, cities and even municipalities have tried what the West has called a sugar tax or soda tax, with mixed results. Denmark, Japan, Mexico, the US among other countries have tried to change consumer behaviour through taxes, but both monitoring and enforcement have proved to be difficult. For India, a good start would be to revert to indigenous grain and drink  and diet  that were healthy, but were overrun by the Green Revolution and liberalisation in the interest of greater productivity and open markets.There is little doubt that India is reaping just desserts for allowing sodas to sweet talk their way into the country with their trash. Nowhere is this more starkly visible than Kerala itself, where its classic indigenous drink, the tender coconut (replete with good fat and electrolytes) has been supplanted by sugary soft drinks  each stacked with 10 or more spoons of sugary sweeteners. The West has realised the damage this is doing to their kids and society. Soft drink sales have been falling sharply in the US, as it happened with smoking. Guess whos picking up the slack.So while both the central government and state government would be correct to take aim at the garbage food dispensers who have wormed their way into India (and into much of the developing world), New Delhi also has to take care of business at the bottom end. The battle should essentially begin from its farms, where we are now the worlds second largest sugar producer (nearly 30 million tonnes), a figure that has nearly doubled over the past decade through government subsidy and support for a crop that sucks water from the ground and health from our bodies.In its place promote coarse, indigenous grains such as ragi (finger millet), bajra (pearl millet), jowar (sorghum), all of them being sold now in western countries for top dollar.Of course, the sugar lobby will argue that eating sugar does not cause diabetes per se if you limit your intake. That is akin to the gun lobbys case that its not guns that cause deaths but people who use guns. People use it because the country is awash in the stuff, whether it is guns or sugar."
590475a37be9e04154df73e6,National breastfeeding week 2016: Mother’s speak,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/your-fertility-friend/national-breastfeeding-week-2016-mothers-speak/,2016-08-04,"On the occasion of National breastfeeding week 2016, I would like to share a couple of questions that hover in the minds of nursing mothers during their breastfeeding journey.I am having low milk supply. Are there any foods that can help me in improving lactation?Being a nursing mother, you will surely have tons of questions revolving in your mind. Every mother is deeply concerned about their newborns health and growth and wish to resort for the best. During the nursing phase, the mother should pay more attention to her health since whatever the mother consumes plays an important role in post-delivery recovery and amount of breast milk produced.Here is a list of few foods that are must-have for nursing mothers to improve milk supply:Oatmeal:Oats regulate the possibilities of having diabetes after birth. They are a great source of fiber and aids in indigestion. You can have a bowl of oatmeal in morning or grab a few oatmeal cookies.Spinach and Beet Leaves:Spinach and beet leaves are full of iron, calcium and folic acid and promotes lactation. They strengthen the baby and also prevent breast cancer in mothers. The best way to eat is to mix the spinach and beet leaves in moderation and prepare dough for parathas.Carrots:Carrots are rich in Vitamin A which directly complements lactation and also improves the quality of breast milk. A glass of carrot juice with breakfast or lunch will do wonders.Fenugreek Seeds:Fenugreek seeds are a proven method for enhancing breast milk supply. Mix fenugreek seeds and rice in parathas and enjoy a healthy breakfast.Basil Leaves:Basil leaves are anti-oxidant rich and help in increasing babys immunity. Also, it gives a calming effect. Dip the basil leaves in hot water overnight, drink the mixture every morning and experience the difference.Bottle Gourd:Bottle gourd is not a vegetable in true sense but is highly nutritious. It helps in keeping the nursery mother hydrated throughout the day. Have a fresh glass of bottle gourd juice to keep the blood sugar levels in control post-delivery.What should I avoid eating during my breastfeeding phase?Are you wondering why your breast milk supply low? Or do you need any change in your diet that is lowering your milk supply production?Here is a list of foods that you should avoid during your breastfeeding phase:Citrus Fruits:Citrus fruits have high vitamin C content, which is healthy for you and your baby. However, some babies may suffer from diarrhea due to sensitivity to vitamin C as it interrupts with the babys gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, avoid consuming citrus fruits like oranges and lemons and switch to kiwis, papayas, mangoes, pineapples and raspberries.Peanuts:If your family has genetic condition of peanut allergies then avoid having peanuts during your breastfeeding phase. Peanuts have proteins that may act as allergens during breastfeeding resulting in symptoms like rashes, wheezing or hives in baby.Caffeine:Having caffeine in moderation is absolutely fine. Note that high consumption of caffeine reduces iron content in breast milk as well as hemoglobin levels.Chocolate:Chocolate might be a great alternative for you to satisfy your sweet tooth but it involves theobromine. If a nursing mother intakes more than 750 mg of theobromine per day, there are chances of baby exhibiting erratic behaviors and sleep issues.When should I stop breastfeeding my baby?The best time for breastfeeding is until your baby turns six months. This phase is very crucial as it is the development period of your baby. So continue breastfeeding till six months for a healthy start. Later, if you and your baby are enjoying breastfeeding can be done till 2 years. It can be followed by introducing complementary foods along with breastfeeding or as desired after six months of breastfeeding.For how long can I store my breast milk?To ensure that stored breast milk stays fresh for longer time, keep in mind a few guidelines as follows: Room temperature: Breast milk could be stored at room temperature for upto 6 hours Insulated cooler: Breast milk can be stored in an insulated cooler for 24 hours Refrigerator: Breast milk could be stored in a refrigerator for 5 days Deep freezer: Breast milk can be stored at the back of deep freezer upto 6 monthsHow is foremilk and hindmilk different from each other?You might have heard that mothers produce two types of milk at the beginning of breastfeeding phase. Foremilk is the thinner and low-fat milk which the baby receives at first. While milk is being produced, the fat layer sticks to the boundaries of milk-making cells while the liquid content of the milk moves down the milk ducts towards the nipple, where it combines with the leftover milk in the previous feeding.When the hindmilk mixes with the high-lactose foremilk, it becomes the perfect food for babies. This yields high-calorie and high-fat milk content that helps in babys growth and brain development.I may be having hypothyroidism; can I still breastfeed my baby?Hypothyroidism is a serious condition of having an underactive thyroid that directly impacts the metabolic rate. The symptoms of hypothyroidism consist of fatigue, poor appetite, depression, intolerance to cold, thinning hair and dry skin. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be determined as the symptoms and a simple blood test. A radioactive testing may also be used. The duration of the mother required to let down breastfeeding depends upon the type of radioactive materials used. Radioactivity of breast milk decreases with time and frequent milk expression may help the mother remove radioactivity for her and the milk should be discarded and not fed to baby.Breastfeeding is not just a duty but the creation of a pure and loving bond between the mother and baby. As soon as a baby is born, the breast milk of the mother becomes its source of life. It is beneficial for both the mother and the baby. Therefore, all the would-be mothers stick to breastfeeding instead of formula milk products. Happy Breastfeeding!"

We know it was the raging heart of the great 1857 revolt that shook British raj. The small town was once the centre of a multi-million rupee Hindi pulp fiction industry and still manufactures the finest cricket bats in the country. But many may not know that Meerut is a gastronomic delight too.Our first stop is the famous Jain Ki Shikanji shop at Modinagar. There are dozens of shikanji sellers in this town once famous for Modi suiting and shirtings. But Jains small cubicle-size shop, located by the police station, is the real McCoy. Shikanji was created to beat the summer heat. And at Jains, you know how. The drinks preparation is a short seven-step to heaven. First, a measured portion of sugar syrup is poured into a glass; followed by a strong squeeze of lemon.The glass is stuffed with crushed ice. Then a bottle of soda is emptied over it. This is followed by a spoonful of the special shikanji masala. The glass is then capped and shaken. Your drink is ready. Unlike Coke, the ingredients is no state secret. You can buy them separately too.The drink fortifies us for the lunch ahead. Asking passers by every 50 metres, we arrive at Papa Ji Daal Wale (sic), a dhaba near the old Baghpat More bus stand. Daal is to any meal what Laxman is to Ramayan: vital and self-effacing. At Papaji, it commands centre stage. The shop, owned by a genial sardarji, specialises in urad-chane ki daal which is slow cooked over low fire overnight. We want to pack some for dinner.But sardarji hasnt come in yet and without him, the staff refuses to serve. We leave with a heavy, hungry heart.Delhi Durbar, next to Imliyan Masjid, is on Hapur Road. Far more accommodating, they usher us into the new air-conditioned section where a young man is feeding what looks like fruit-cream to a woman in burqa. Our order is simple: chicken kali mirch and tandoori roti. One of us orders a chicken biryani too. The biryani is a crushing disappointment, it feels more like chicken in fried rice minus the finesse. But the chicken kali mirch is just right; its thick curry blended in cashew and cream. Flavour and taste blend to create a dish that is pure bliss. It is worth a hundred trips from Delhi. Anytime.Thats the unanimous view.On the way back, we pick up the dal. But before that we stumble upon the culinary treasure of the day. We spot a hotel whose name reminds me of an old Bollywood song. Its called, Char Yaar, and it was set up in 1950. Its basically a sweet shop that specialises in halwa-parantha. The deep-friend paranthas are the size of a large pizza and its crisp and flaky, much like a patty. The halwa, topped with cherries, is equally oily. You can say, its a dish to die for.Rather literally. But as food explorers, this is our discovery of the day. We taste some and pack the rest. It has been a week since that afternoon but the taste of the chicken kali mirch lingers on."
59048bfa7be9e04154df85f6,A sugar tax unaccompanied by a fuller lifestyle change may not be enough,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/a-sugar-tax-unaccompanied-by-a-fuller-lifestyle-change-may-not-be-enough/,2016-10-13,"World Health Organization has targeted sugar in its attempt to provide a framework for countries to deal with the growing incidence of noncommunicable disease.WHOs attempts are particularly useful for a country such as India which has to simultaneously deal with both infectious disease and noncommunicable disease. The solution to deal with a part of noncommunicable problem is presented in a report titled Fiscal Policies for Diet and Prevention of Noncommunicable Disease.The report suggests countries impose impose a tax which would result in an increase in the retail price of sugar sweetened beverages by at least 20% as it would restrict consumption.The appropriate fiscal policy is discussed in detail and comes with caveats.In addition, WHO suggests a sugar tax should be used in conjunction with a subsidy which would reduce the price of fruits and vegetables by 10-30%. The aim being to bring about a behavioural change by getting people to shift calorie intake from sugar sweetened beverages to a healthier source.A behavioural change is indeed at the heart of an attempt to reduce the incidence of noncommunicable disease. But a sugar tax is not the most convincing argument.During a recent visit to India, Kenneth E. Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University, US, explained the problem in the following manner.On the food side it is more complicated because the root of it is changing peoples behavior. You are not going to get sustained results unless you change peoples behavior. You can temporarily change where they get their calories from, but if you are not going to change their eating behavior and exercise behaviors, I dont know if at the end of the day how much effect it will have.Changing eating habits is surely important. But it is debatable if meaningful progress can be made without changing sedentary lifestyles.Research in U.K, which I had written about in an older blog, showed that sedentary lifestyles had more than offset a decline in calorie consumption over a period of a little more than three decades.Therefore, without a more comprehensive change in lifestyles, the potential benefit of an appropriate sugar tax along with subsidised fruits and vegetables may be limited.Sedentary lifestyles may well be the most insidious health hazard around."

The same NDA has set an ambitious target of exporting 4 million tonnes in September last year giving a major fillip to the industry that was in the slump for the past few years.Last week, the Finance Ministry had said that the governments decision to tax export of raw, refined and white sugar exports is being done to keep domestic prices of sugar in check. This may have been a pre-emptive measure as production of sugarcane is expected to be lower than the previous year of 28 million tonnes.#Sugar #exports unviable after imposition of 20% duty: ISMA https://t.co/m5ULtGNzYJ pic.twitter.com/k0R1FbyASl  EconomicTimes (@EconomicTimes) June 17, 2016The question is if the government knew that production of sugar will take a hit as early as August last year, then why try to incentivise exports? Some states governments like Maharashtra went a step further by giving sugar mills a 3 per cent tax rebate if they could export 12 per cent of their output in the period from October 2015-September 2016. The central government then set an export target of 4 million tonnes, only to impose a 20% tax on it a few months later.Plan to levy tax could hit 75,000 tonnes sugar exports: Official https://t.co/lGY8AqVJSZ pic.twitter.com/qdxbS4RU3N  ET Economy News (@ETEconomyNews) June 10, 2016This comes as a double whammy for sugar mills. Unlike other crops, sugarcane is politically sensitive. Vested interests ensure that the Minimum Support Price is always kept high irrespective of the prevailing prices. As per Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) data, planting of sugarcane has gone up from 4,175,000 hectares to 5,307,000 hectares while production increased from 2,923 lakh tonne to 3,668 lakh tonne in the past 6 years. This means that cost of production for mill owners has kept increasing over the years due to MSP and more sowing of sugarcane, but prices have remained low.Sugarcane arrears down at Rs 6,225 crore https://t.co/wW8ESqrZRq pic.twitter.com/1FlfPSdyg2  moneycontrol (@moneycontrolcom) June 8, 2016If the tax was not levied on sugar companies, they could have wiped out losses of previous years with an export target of 4 million tonnes. It would have resulted in bringing down the cane arrears of farmers which stand at Rs 6,225 crore. This will have direct, adverse consequences on the farmer- the lowest rung in the food chain. As losses generally mount for sugar companies, so do the arrears to farmers. In their attempt to protect the consumer, the government seems to have given up on protecting the interest of the farmers."
59048c367be9e04154df864e,"Target Sugary Drinks: WHO has now backed extra taxes on these beverages, to fight lifestyle diseases",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/target-sugary-drinks-who-has-now-backed-extra-taxes-on-these-beverages-to-fight-lifestyle-diseases/,2016-10-14,"In a new report, WHO has backed taxes on sugary drinks to fight the global obesity and diabetes epidemics. According to the health bodys Fiscal Policies for Diet and Prevention of Non-communicable Diseases, if retail prices of sugar-sweetened drinks are increased by 20% through taxation, there would be a proportional drop in consumption. Previously, WHO had advised low-sugar intake but had stopped short of backing tax measures. Its recommendations now are based on a review of the available evidence. Countries like France, Mexico and Hungary already tax sugary drinks higher. Britain will follow suit in two years time.Renewed focus on cutting down sugar intake is in light of obesity more than doubling worldwide between 1980 and 2014  more than 500 million people are classified as obese  even as scientific evidence grows that sugar is a worse health hazard than fat. Modern dietary choices, combined with more sedentary lifestyles, have raised the incidences of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases alarmingly. Among children, studies have shown that obesity even affects learning outcomes. So concerted efforts are needed to push consumers towards healthier diets.This is more challenging in developing countries where hunger remains a huge problem and simultaneously diseases such as diabetes are growing at a fast clip. India is considered the diabetes capital of the world with at least 50 million people suffering from the disease. In fact, sugar-sweetened beverages account for one in every 200 deaths caused by cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity in India. This needs to be reversed by following the new WHO recommendation. The Modi government had increased the tax on sugar-sweetened beverages by 5% in July 2014 but more needs to be done. Given the evidence, its time to treat sugary drinks as a serious health hazard."

Blessed with mindblowing natural beauty, vivid tribes, diverse cultural traditions and the most humble people, the Northeast enriches the socio-cultural milieu of India manifold.But we have heard this all before. For years people have talked about the potential of the Northeast, both in terms of development and cultural influence. However, mainstream India continues to view the region as an exotic reservation. Its the same feeling that one gets when visiting a museum. You see the different exhibits, learn about them, and go home happy. That said, how much do we really imbibe? Very little. This sort of an aquarium-like approach to the Northeast is meaningless.We need the Northeast to flow out of the festivals and exhibitions and enter our living rooms. We need to don Northeastern threads, we need to learn Northeastern languages, we need to hum Northeastern songs, and give Northeastern food the same status as chicken tikka or idli sambar.We now have many Northeast artistes working in Bollywood. But we need so-called mainstream movies to effortlessly meld the Northeast into their scripts. A couple of years ago, Kalki Koechlin starrer Margarita With A Straw had a song called Dusokute which is Assamese for in the eyes. We need more of this. For only when the Northeast becomes a part of our popular imagination, and not just selective consciousness, that the region will truly become a model for all.This is precisely what the Northeast Festival aims to facilitate. Not only does it showcase myriad Northeast talents in fashion, music and handicraft, but also influence the intellectual discourse on the region through stimulating discussion sessions. It provides a platform not just for appreciating the region but also diving right into it. Its high time we stop distinguishing between the mainstream and the Northeast. The two ought to be one like sugar (Northeast) in milk (India). And if you arent convinced head down to the Northeast festival this weekend. You are bound to have a change of heart."
59048c8a7be9e04154df86c6,Everything sanitised,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/first-person/everything-sanitised/,2016-10-18,"If you think, transplant was the biggest hurdle I crossed in my life, think again.Protecting my body against any kind of secondary infection, while on a heavy dose of immuno-suppressants for at least three months, post surgery (ideally, its got to be six months) initially turned out to be a much bigger, non-negotiable challenge.Adding to the feeling of forelone-ness was the solitary confinement. Dealing with the fear psychosis of infection, where, it was made to seem that everything around me could be a potential carrier of a deadly disease; there were germs, bacteria and viruses permeating everything I came in contact with, so was specifically instructed to sanitise my hands, after every touch. During the initial few days, post surgery, the face mask, head cap, shoe covers and the heavy hospital, green gown, which was two size too big for me, had to be discarded or put into wash after one use.Please dont take that risk, if you dont want to land up back in the hospital, a patient, who had survived the ordeal, 11 months ago, counselled me over phone. Wear your face mask for as long as you can. Thats the cardinal rule, he added for good measure.Therefore, from my toothbrush to my cell phone, to everything else that comes in between  my clothes, toiletries, utensils, bed sheets, bath linen, laptop, books  is changed daily or sanitised  as to catch any kind of infection, during the next three months of rehabilitation and recovery, after discharge, I was told, could be fatal.My nephews room, where I have been shifted to post surgery was fumigated by professional hospital staff and not a spec of dust left  inside the AC ducts, outside the window sill (although the windows and vends are not to be ever opened); the drains cleared, the cupboards cleaned and everything was kept sterile in anticipation of my arrival from Pune, on the seventh day of my surgery.Even the bed and bath linen, a few set of clothes for me, two pair of flip flops, toiletries were newly-bought, along with a plastic-covered, sealed paper back on Soka Gakais Happiness gifted by a friend by the bedside table.My drinking water had to be boiled (RO water was inadequate), a practice I shall have to follow for at least a year; my food (thankfully post surgery all my salt and water restrictions are lifted) is freshly prepared and consumed and includes a massive proportion of proteins; my daily newspapers are microwaved; I have to be masked in the presence of others, including family members; and no handshakes for at least six months came the doctors warnings.In effect, for a month at least, I am quarantined, in my room.I can go down for brisk walk, masked, and fully-covered, but at a time when there are the fewest possible visitors at the podium, so its usually 5 am and again 4 pm in the evening. People look at me oddly, but thankfully, dont stare or comment.For the first month, I had a day-nurse to give me medicine, take note of my biometrics, update my doctors in Pune, empty my drain bag, give me a bath, dress me, and braid my hair, accompany me during my walks and learnt to even take my pictures (for my future book) but as the days rolled, I gradually took over all these chores, until, there was nothing left for her to do, that I couldnt do myself.One thing Ive noticed is that once you start listening closely to your body, all internal changes, even the slightest variation in your blood sugar level, your blood pressure etc gets amplified. You dont need machines to read your biometrics then. You can sense those intuitively and I realise I m now getting good at this practice.While initially, being confined to a room seemed like a punishment, now Ive learnt to take it as an opportunity. Sliding into the slow time; doing my own thing and think; watching all the films I had missed at cinema halls, due to my other commitments; discovering rejuvenation in music; and of course, amidst all this, discovering myself.My schedule is packed."
59048cbb7be9e04154df871b,"Eat cake, not bread",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jyotsna-mohan-bhargava-blog/eat-cake-not-bread/,2016-05-27,"The other day my 4-year-old daughter mentioned gluten free food in passing as though its normal nursery chatter. Kids clearly have more than two ears and they easily pick up what they hear at home, mine is a confluence or rather confusion of two different types of thoughts on something as basic as the food on our table.I am one of those who reads everything that doesnt need to be read and changes the dining table menu into something that no one wants to eat. I have gone organic, except that its karma but one of my kids had an allergic reaction to those pure eggs. My husband on the other hand thinks its all hocus pocus and we are taking everything to ridiculous heights.But the CSE report on bread containing an additive Potassium Bromate that is potentially carcinogenic and already banned by the European Union, Canada and China amongst several other countries has for once even made my husband quiet. One can argue that the US hasnt but thats a country where commercial giants are known to sideline human interest. Its a bit like why more and more doctors encourage caesarean surgeries on women when they can do with the healthier and cheaper option of delivering naturally. Adversely, thats also what seems to have happened with Maggie which lost a battle that had nothing to do it seems with health standards.Give us today our daily bread is now a making us wish it away so fast that even paranthas which maybe bad for the waistline now seem safer. The debate no longer is about how unhealthy junk or processed food is for you and me, instead it is about eliminating ordinary eatables that contain poisonous elements. My grumbling kids who always prefer white normal bread with dollops of butter, had stopped eating it often because they detested the multi-grain or the oats variety that I force-fed them with. Its all pointless now, one it seems is as bad as the other.So much for also telling them stories of Sindbad and how he developed muscles by eating the superfood Spinach. Every year a list called the dirty dozen is released with names of fruits and vegetables that have the most pesticides. The real shocker is the fruit that has made it to number 1 five years in a row, the apple has turned the phrase of keeping a doctor away on its head. Try scrapping it before you feed your child, I have had a knife covered with white wax.Then of course our friendly neighbourhood Mother Dairy stores that are happily injecting the very refreshing looking watermelon or immersing dye in green beans. For the longest time, whenever we visited my family in Punjab my husband would say that the fresh looking fruits and vegetables are calling to be picked up and would want to load up the car with all sorts of melons and oranges. Now we know that the free for all use of pesticides sprayed on the crops is why they look shiny and are a big reason for the spike in cancer cases across the state. It took our paediatrician to convince my husband that these stories are not exaggerated, her advice, buy the apple that no one wants to eat.They say maintain a healthy lifestyle. I am all for the daily walk and some exercise but a man still gotta eat three healthy meals a day. I have tried everything from a gluten free diet to eliminating sugar completely from my house but those are the dispensables, how do we now deal with something as innocuous and ingrained as the bread being taken off the table? Tomorrow it could be something else.I am in the midst of a family debate on milk and often told to stop being a quack. My argument is that our doctors will always tell us the conventional and sometimes we cant ignore the changed ground realities, whats the point of calcium when the same milk is laced with chemicals? Our food authority also does not give us the feeling of assurance, sadly it only reacts.Going organic is not an option for everyone and even for those who can, its an exorbitant way of living and there is no guarantee that what we are paying through our nose for is actually natural all the way. Hormone free chicken may sound better than it really is.The only thing that works then is to keep rotating and using anything that could be controversial within limits. Case in point the lady who recently won millions in damages against Baby Johnson for its products being cancerous. She was using the same talcum powder decades after decades.Too much information is also a scourge of our times. Sometimes I know we are going overboard, when did our parents ever use sunscreen to play outside, so its a tricky balancing field. My family doctor once said, let kids be kids. Which means even though Nutella or coloured gems that we grew up eating are now considered downright unsafe, we still need to give them an occasional treat, a packet of Kale chips is just not fair.To say you only live once and enjoy everything may be well and good because thankfully those who say it have escaped the repercussions. Ask those families who have faced realities and have no choice but to eat the cleanest, to them this probably sounds frivolous. But its also easy to get overwhelmed with such negative news. Instead, maybe its time to take a deep breath, eliminate what makes one uneasy and move on. And like me, do not consider google the real doctor."
590493257be9e04154df8ab7,Sahyadari: My second birthplace,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/first-person/sahyadari-my-second-birthplace/,2016-10-03,"My surgeon at Sahyadari Multi-Specialty Hospital in Pune, Dr Bipin Vibhute, has the thoughtful bearings of a French scholar.In contract, his deputy, Dr Manish Pathak, is portly, affable and blessed with ban infectious laugh.For me both were so accessible that till date, almost a month after my surgery, I have am to report my biometrics  sugar level, blood pressure, temperature, weight etc.  to them, through SMS, or call, twice a day, and they respond promptly, if they are not in the OT. The practice has to be maintained for at least another month. Thats on doctors orders.When I came around, after my surgery and met Dr Bipin and Dr Manish, sans mask, I couldnt recognize him, so he had to re-introduce himself. Yes I am on first name basis with them.Although cautioned beforehand, when I regained consciousness post-surgery, every cell in my body was aching, and I had tubes and pipes of all kinds to infuse and flush out fluids into and from my limp body. Worse, I was on the ventilator.During my mothers ordeal on the vent four years ago, Id learnt to read the monitor, saturation, heartbeat, pulse etc., so turning my head to the side, I saw I was on the borderline.I floated in and out of consciousness that day, the effect of general anesthesia. But I overheard, my gentle doppler lady, who would do sonographies on me that could put me to sleep, whisper to Dr Bipin in hushed tones that day, The right lung is completely collapsed.Even in that prone state, I could vaguely recollect that my mothers post surgical septicemia had also started with lung infection, that till her very end, she could not shake off. I did not want to be in the same spot.You possibly have had lung infection for a long time. But there is no option. We have to get rid of that now, declared Dr Bipin to me with quiet certitude, the next day, when I was fully conscious.In days to come, I would love the way; he left no options for me  no fever, no vomiting, no loose motions.I did have fever though  on the third night post surgery  100 F. The alarmed nurse-sister must have rung up Dr Bipin at least six times during the course of the night. Under his instructions, she gave me a cold sponge first, then aspirin (intravenously) and the temperature came down.On the second day of the surgery, they removed the catheter and the central line, so I could begin walking with the oxygen cylinder. I was off the vent.From then on, the head physiotherapist, and his assistant, Jenny, would visit me at least six times a day to make me walk, exercise and do my spirometer, that I always referred to as speedometer -a Freudian slip?I was also instructed to carry a sputum bowl, taught how to clean and empty my drain bag (it drains out waste fluid from the stomach, left by the surgery), give myself an insulin shot, though I never actually was put on it, oil and braid my hair in two plain Jane plaits  by Sahyadris caring doctors and nursing staff.The medicine regime had to be followed strictly, alternating lifesaving with other pills. I was constantly reassured that all except one immunosuppressant  pan graph  would continue lifelong, in three months. The rest will taper off.On the fourth day, my saturation was normal and I could laugh, cry, sing, cajole my nurse to sing off-key with me and sometimes babble non-stop, imagining it was good for my weak lungs, when it was the effect of steroids.But there was no appetite. No sleep either with my Bilirubin hovering at an alarming 11 mark, when the normal range is below 1. My eyes and stools were canary yellow. My hands till date, shake a little, so typing on my phone keypad is often difficult.Thats normal. Bilirubin does shoot up post liver transplant once, before it starts falling into the normal range, observed Dr Bipin. As I write this, its 4.5 and falling.Eat proteins, a lot of it, if you want to go home in a weeks time  eat anything that you dig but no outside food, cautioned Dr Manish. Meanwhile, the new liver started doing its job.During a Doppler test, Dr Bipin Vibhute, exclaimed, hold that image, I want to take a pix. Look at the hepatic artery. It is functioning beautifully!I was relieved. My well-behaved other organs were accepting their new mate. On the sixth day, I was ready for discharge.I threw one look at my sterile, Spartan room at Sahyadri and the mountain range, after which the hospital is named that, was my skyline from the window and vowed not to come back into that room again with a secondary infection.But I knew Id always miss the hushed, polite tones of my nurse-sisters, the helpful caregivers  mausi (aunt) and mamu (uncles)  their names for ward women and men and the warmth of my doctors on the liver transplant team.Armed with a new liver, I was ready to fly out of the nest."
590493277be9e04154df8abb,Venezuela: Dying for global health attention,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/global-health-focus/venezuela-dying-for-global-health-attention/,2016-06-23,"It is well known that Venezuela is in a deepening mess that is here to stay for long. It no longer matters what lead to the crisis and different sources have different versions of the story to tell. Violence and looting, has surrounded the country side on a normal day. It is little different from terrorism for innocent civilians, desperately searching for meaning and direction. Watch group observatory for violence said that on an average around 10 lootings are taking place daily where people are searching for rice to detergents to toilet paper and also beer. Lack of electricity has created massive rolling blackouts. Large scale violence has engulfed Venezuela and people are robbing and killing for a living. Going by records, Venezuelas capital is the most violent city in the world with the highest rate of global homicides. The kidnapping rate when compared to countries like Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria also remains high in Venezuela. This is clearly a society in distress.International humanitarian organizations are yet to arrive in bulk as the government is showing heightened levels of arrogance to accepting global help.Amidst all the economic disruptions the health impact that is being built on Venezuela is pushing the civilians to the brink and is almost a unique man made humanitarian disaster. Venezuelas economy is one of the worst in the world and according to the International Monetary Fund, the recession and downward spiral in economy will remain until 2019. Inflation grew upto 500% this year and this is not a very encouraging sign for the future of the Latin American country.Venezuelas top three universities showed that people were eating less than three meals a day, which was revealed through a research study. Eating less will naturally lead to decreased nutritional intakes and will eventually make civilians vulnerable to certain diseases. Children who do not get food and are under 5 years old, will go into malnutrition that remains a significant problem in Venezuela. Doctors have abandoned hospitals and left the place because of gross distress. No doctors in hospitals means the end in view for those patients on palliative care and those suffering from chronic diseases. What is alarming is that the International community has not yet understood the magnitude of the problem and global aid has not yet started coming into Venezuela. The global media are far too isolated and have not felt the desperation of the situation. Possibly for countries in Europe and Asia, Latin American Crisis gets neglected attention. El Guri Dam, the countrys main power generating source is at new record low level and the government blames drought to run away from taking responsibility and fixing the problem. In the light of this emergency, the United Nations should pressurise the International Community and the diplomatic wings to tell the world of this deepening crisis. The global health community are tearing their heads apart. From juggling the African health situation which struggles for basic health care, to addressing migrant issues on health in Europe, to focusing on war zones and depleting health work-force in those conflict zones, to facing disasters and emerging infections, to address rising burden of non-communicable diseases and to pacify road injury victims, increased spending and increased corporate spending for social responsibility should become the dictum of the day.Venezuelas Government is in distress, it cannot afford to pay for products like sugar, eggs, flour and milk. In the light of sugar crisis, the global giant of beverages, Coke announced stoppage of its outlets in Venezuela. Government officials work only twice a week to save electricity and medical supplies are getting scare. The nations 30 million people are only counting on hope and prayer to resurrect them from this crisis.Are we listening?Recently in a statement, The Ministry of Health, Venezuela said that 75 % of the medicines described as essential is not existing in Venezuela and with the added burden of Zika virus epidemic doing the rounds, the collapse of the health system is imminent. However, the health systems decline will not only paralyze Venezuelas citizens, it is going to create devastating impact on neighbouring countries like Colombia and Guyana which is already in political crisis.The solution to the above is straightforward. International pressure on the Venezuela Government to encourage and appeal to outside help needs to be stepped up, to seek soft loans from other nations and to take tough decision to reduce inflation. To address health care as a very very urgent mandate and permit outside health workers to remain in the country for at least a year. In answering some of these basics, we will be able to move forward slowly, very slowly."
590493317be9e04154df8acc,Top woman health official has put Tamil Nadu on millet mode,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/top-woman-health-official-has-put-tamil-nadu-on-millet-mode/,2016-06-22,"Consumption of polished rice, which is the preference of the majority , has been identified as the key reason for lifestyle diseases like diabetes. Millets, traditionally a poor mans staple which can reduce sugar levels naturally , had been virtually wiped out from the diet of Tamils in recent decades. Nair acknowledged this at a conference hosted by the College of Food and Dairy Technology in Chennai in 2014. In her valedictory address, she had delved in detail on the necessity of millets. The CM is also keen on reviving consumption of traditional food grains, she remarked then.A series of workshops on millets and their role in diabetes prevention, overall nutritional value, and income generation was organized for self-help groups. Agricultural department officials were sensitized to the importance of millets. Under the State Balanced Growth Fund (SBGF) which tackled inter-district disparities, financial assistance was given to promote cultivation of millets  primarily as a droughtresistant crop. Nair herself began to consume millets and vouched for its benefits, said Ananthoo, a safe food activist based in Chennai, adding millet biscuits were served in official meetings with tea.Based on crop suitability and climatic conditions, schemes were designed by the planning commission so that dry districts reaped the maximum benefits. In 2013-14, the planning commission realised that traditional grain polishing equipment was removing the nutritional parts even from the millet grains. Recognising that, Nair worked with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) to finetune the huller and decrease the gap of the rolling wheels. This ensured that the polished grain still had the nutrients. Mini-mills were also commissioned specifically for millets, said an expert from SPC.This eventually won Tamil Nadu recognition from department of agriculture and cooperation, ministry of agriculture. The state won the Krishi Karman award in 2014-15 for the production of coarse cereals. Ananthoo recalled how a decade back, millets would be available only in one store in Adyar, but are now available in any street corner. A lot of credit for this should go to Santha Sheela Nair and the Millets Mission, he says. Today , millets cost `50 to `100 per kg at shops.However, Ananthoo also points out how the state still has a long way to go, as far as re-introducing millets into the poor mans diet is concerned. Millets are not yet available in PDS shops. The onus is on the government to take it to the masses through hostels, noonmeal scheme and balwadis, he said.He also says that the state should ensure availability of traditional seeds to farmers and provide them with small machines to de-husk and process millets."
5904934d7be9e04154df8af7,The alcoholic mammaries of the welfare state,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/the-alcoholic-mammaries-of-the-welfare-state/,2016-05-08,"Upamanyu Chatterjee once wrote a book titled The Mammaries of the Welfare State. If he visited Tamil Nadu today, he would be tempted to write another called The Alcoholic Mammaries of Tamil Nadus Welfare State. Tamil Nadu gives away more freebies to voters than any other state. Its dark secret is that these freebies are financed mainly by massive revenues from liquor sales.All liquor shops are run by TASMAC, a government monopoly, to maximize revenue. TASMAC makes additional money by leasing space to private bars within liquor shops. Liquor revenue has risen from Rs 2,800 crore in 2002-03 to Rs 30,000 crore today. To finance an ever-growing list of freebies, the state government has aggressively expanded the number of liquor shops, making access easy. These now open early in the morning, leading to stories of drunkenness before noon.In one sense this approach has succeeded: liquor revenues have boomed. But in another sense the strategy has failed. It has created a big backlash from women complaining of abuse and wasted household money. The DMK has blamed chief minister Jayalalithaa for encouraging drunks, and promised to impose prohibition if elected. Jayalalithaa in turn has accused the DMK of relaxing prohibition when it was in power, and proposed phased prohibition herself.Neither party can explain how the freebies will continue if there is no liquor revenue. The history of India is replete with examples of prohibition being introduced to win the female vote at elections, followed by a fiscal crisis caused by lack of liquor revenue, followed by a return to liquor sales. History will surely repeat itself in Tamil Nadu.It is by no means the only state where prohibition has become a major election issue. West Bengal and Kerala, two other states currently holding state elections, also have parties promising prohibition. They too have no convincing explanation of how liquor revenue will be replaced. But none has as long a list of freebies as Tamil Nadu, whose task is therefore most daunting.Jayalalithaa has just released her party manifesto. Her list of freebies includes: free cellphones for rationcard holders; free laptops with internet connections for 10th and 12th class students; maternity assistance of Rs 18,000; maternity leave increased from six to nine months; one hundred free electricity units every two months; waiver of all farm loans (at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore); fisherfolk assistance to be hiked to Rs 5,000; women to get 50% subsidy to buy mopeds or scooters; an eight-gram gold coin for women getting married; a free Amma kit including sanitary napkins; and much more. Note that Jayalalithaa already provides 20 kilos of free rice per family, a free mixer-grinder and fan per family, subsidized Amma kitchens, and subsidized goats or cows for rural families.The state is reputed to be Indias best in delivering many government services, including education, health, MNREGA and the public distribution system. However, complaints of corruption are rising. Industrialists say this has been worsening for 15 years, eroding a oncestrong reputation for being a business-friendly state. One industrialist says that if you do not pay up, an army of inspectors will descend to harass you and threaten to close your establishment. An educationist complains that environment clearance is now required even for educational institutions, with the bribe for clearance fixed at so much per square foot of space.The sugar industry ran up enormous losses in recent years because state-advised cane prices were very high in relation to sugar prices. Modis rescue package for sugar mills in 2014 included raising the amount of alcohol to be blended with petrol from 5% to 10%, with the ethanol price rising from Rs 34.50 to Rs 48.50 per litre. But Jayalalithaa wants to maximize alcohol for liquor production. And so she has limited ethanol supply by sugar mills to oil companies to a trickle. The sugar mills are crying foul, in vain. She says she is industry-friendly, but is friendlier to the liquor industry than any other. Thats what produces the money for freebies.Elections in Tamil Nadu are rarely fought on policy issues. Both sides agree on a mixture of economic development and welfarism. Elections are contested mainly on the personal popularity of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, and on competition in freebies. Using liquor revenue to improve basic state services like education and health is defensible. Using it for freebies is a political race between parties to the fiscal bottom. It can only end in tears."

With such superficial and twisted standards of beauty, body shaming and low self-esteem have become a part and parcel of an average womans life. We are flooded with digitally altered pictures of women with flawless skin, tiny waists and thigh gaps. It is, therefore, crucial to promote body positivity among women across the globe, especially teenagers, who are psychologically and emotionally vulnerable to body image issues.#thighsforjeaux is a hashtag that is a step forward in this direction. Started by a 21-year-old South African woman, who goes by the name @Mijeaux on Twitter, this hashtag celebrates thighs in every shape and size. It all began when she tweeted a picture of her own imperfect thighs to inspire other women to do the same. Soon, thousands of women from all walks of life replied to her post with their own pictures.It started for the first time in March, 2015. But the movement became so popular that it has been revived a couple of times ever since once in January this year and now again for the third time.This time around, she called out to women all over the world to share unfiltered photos of their thighs, irrespective of how fat, hairy, stretched or imperfect they are. And the response has been overwhelming.Earlier this year, another thigh-gap busting trend of #MermaidThighs had taken social media by a storm which asked women to denounce the entire idea of having a thigh-gap in order to be beautiful.To my thighs and yours.

590494b07be9e04154df8cfb,Pickup in wholesale prices after 17 months signals a slow revival in demand in the economy,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/pickup-in-wholesale-prices-after-17-months-signals-a-slow-revival-in-demand-in-the-economy/,2016-05-16,"The numbers on the latest trends in wholesale prices released by the government today shows that the overall prices have started picking up once again after declining for 17 straight months. This is a positive development as a reversal of the falling rends indicates that demand in the economy is finally picking up after stagnating or declining for an extended period during the previous months.This is especially so in the current context as the pickup in wholesale prices has been primarily fuelled by the rise in prices of manufactured products where the trends have been reversed with the prices picking up after falling steadily for the last 13 months. Manufactured good prices, which account for almost a weighted two third share of the wholesale price index, in fact turned around from a negative 0.1% in March to a positive 0.7% in April.This change in trend in wholesale manufactured good prices is especially reassuring as prices in this segment has tripped substantially with the fall in prices accelerating from 0.2% in March 2015 to 2% by August 2015. Though the fall in manufactured product prices had decelerated since then it continued to be in negative territory till the turn of the last financial year.Though the overall pick up in manufactured goods prices to 0.7% in April may seem to be too meagre to indicate any substantial improvement in demand the scenario is still very positive as prices of many important manufactured goods products are picking up faster than that of the overall segment.For instance trends during the last six months show that prices of manufactured food products has gone up from 1.1% in November 2015 to 8% in April 2016. But this seems to have been triggered off by supply shortages as in the case of sugar and edible oil products, and not by any firm revival in demand. The weak revival in consumer demand is also indicated by the trends in prices of major consumer products like cotton and manmade textiles where prices continue to decline.However, prices of some investment goods, show some positive pick up. For instance prices of cement has turned positive after falling for the previous two months. Similarly fall in prices of basic metals like iron and steel has been slowed down substantially. However, the most important signal of a rise in investment demand is the slow pick up in prices of machinery and machine tools.In fact the most recent numbers indicate that price of goods in this important segment rose by 0.15%in April after falling for three straight months in a row. This indicates that investment in some sectors of the economy is slowly gaining traction and that it can trigger off more extensive growth if it touches critical levels.This is good news as the annual weather forecasts for the year has also raised hopes of a normal monsoon. This can add momentum to the current trends and give an overall boost to domestic demand and ensure a quicker pickup all around."

The effects of climate change will be through alterations in hydrological regimes, particularly in the form of sea level rise, the nature and variability of the hydro-period and the number and severity of extreme events such as storms, cyclones, floods and droughts.While the continued loss of coastal ecosystems has tremendous economic and biological consequences, especially in economies such as India, a few changes have already been observed in the Cauvery delta. These include a change in characteristics of coastal wet lands, lagoons, backwater canals, mangroves and estuaries.The delta is an extremely essential ecosystem ensuring food security , contributing to employment, sustaining biodiversity and providing multiple livelihood systems such as brackish water fishing, salt harvesting and agriculture to its residents.The risks and uncertainties in the delta are however compounding due to several factors including rapid urbanisation, industrialisation, pollution, seawater intrusion and extremities such as storms, cyclones, floods and droughts.The looming threat of climate change and climate variability makes the production conditions of farmers worse.A major factor has been the north east monsoon, which has been more a destroyer than a benefactor to delta farmers. Erratic in nature, it has been bringing intense and heavy spells in a few days of rain and mostly through rough cyclonic storms. According to the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre, four times more cyclones are formed in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea. Cauvery delta which falls in the low elevation coastal zone is also prone to floods  both from sea during dry months and from the Cauvery river during the wet months. And with impacts of climate change-related concerns such as seawater rise looming large, its future is a huge question mark.The delta is also under severe risk due to the uncertainty in the flow of irrigation water from the upstream (Karnataka). As a result, the kuruvai crop season has almost been wiped out except in groundwater irrigated areas.Consequently , the delta agriculture is restricted to only one long duration samba crop which coincides with the north-east monsoon. Unfortunately, even the samba crop season is becoming more uncertain as farmers are not sure whether they will get water in time.Heavy rainfall during the middle of the season or towards the end threatens to ruin the entire crop.Another pressing problem is the vulnerability of Nagapattinam district, which is a long stretch of land along the coast. Elevation mapping suggests that over 70% of the area is prone to floods while sea water ingress has gone up to 20-25 km inland resulting in salinity of top soil and groundwater. At the moment, the entire groundwater stock available in the district is saline.The other bigger threat relates to increasing pollution in Cauvery and its tributaries. Cauverys four ma jor tributaries along with the Kalingarayan canal carry heavy loads of industrial effluent sand urban sew age from towns such as Erode, Tiruppur, Karur and Dindigal which are known for hundreds of dyeing and bleaching units, textiles, tanneries, sugar and paper industries. The Noyyal river is the most notorious among the lot. The Orathapalayam dam constructed across it collects effluent discharged from about one thousand textile dyeing and bleaching units located in and around Tiruppur town. During heavy monsoon months, the dam is opened to clean up the mess which eventually joins the Cauvery . Besides, almost the entire sewage collected from all the towns located along Cauvery and its tributaries are discharged into the river."

Even as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu limped back to normalcy following friction over sharing river water, meteorological reports indicate that southwest monsoon this year may be below normal. This comes on the heels of two years of deficient rainfall, putting more pressure on groundwater resources. Water shortage poses an economic, environmental and security threat to India. Its important all levels of government understand the gravity of the situation. Things can change, but that requires an integrated approach which combines economic incentives, technology and tighter regulations.Agriculture uses about 80% of Indias water resources. A solution, therefore, must focus on changing agricultural practices. Indian agriculture is inefficient in its use of water. We use two to four times more water to produce a unit of major food crop than China or Brazil. Within India, a Punjab or a Maharashtra which are among the most water intensive producers of rice and sugar are key producer states. To get away from this suboptimal situation, governments must realise that power subsidies have had an adverse impact on irrigation patterns. States must break the groundwater-energy nexus to remove a perverse incentive to overuse groundwater.Decades of perverse incentives have led to a situation where 65% of the wells in India registered a decline when water level this year was compared with the last decades average. Action on power subsidies needs to be complemented with use of technology to carry out aquifer mapping. Efforts thus far have been haphazard and technology needs to be used more effectively. Technology and tighter regulations also need to be combined to mitigate water contamination. India may be water stressed but so is Israel, which manages its water resources far better to obviate any shortage."

Surrounded by family and friends, there is frenetic activity as rituals are performed. For ten days now, there has been a constant flow of family and friends coming to give offerings of fruits, flowers, and sweets, all for the venerated guest at home who is about to leave their house. As the time comes to bid farewell to this guest, she feels an overwhelming sense of sadness.The guest the family is bidding adieu to is the elephant god, Ganesha and the festival is Ganesh Chaturthi. The end of the official monsoon season brings around one of Maharashtras best known and most beloved festivals. Celebrated by devotees as the birthday of Ganpati, Ganesh Chaturthi also marks the beginning of a feasting time for gourmands. This is the famous modak season, the dumpling that has been Maharashtras favorite sweet for centuries. Popularly known as ukdiche (steamed) modak, these rice flour dumplings are traditionally stuffed with coconut and jaggery and eaten warm with pure ghee.An interesting nugget my maternal grandmother used to tell us as kids is that shape of a modak is very similar to that of a coconut. As she would roll out the dough amidst a sea of interested grandchildren, she would tell us modak tales and enthrall us by showing us how the shape was in the form of folded palms for Namaskar: a sign of benediction for the god who would visit our house during the season. As we used to roll up the rice flour to stuff the ingredients inside, all of us would vie to make the best namaskar possible to atone for perceived misdemeanors.While the traditional modaks are stuffed with coconut and jaggery mix, the modak, in keeping with the times, has gone through numerous hybrids. So during the season, there are enough variations to whet even the sternest appetite. From modaks stuffed with dry fruits to those infused with strawberry or chocolate mixes, there is a modak for every palate. I have seen modaks steamed with fragrant turmeric leaves, others stuffed with mawa/khoya sugar and cardamom powder and still others stuffed with dried sweet mango. I have even seen modak flour made from dried fruit pulp and rolled out diligently and carefully before being stuffed with desiccated almonds!The festivities and sweets make ones diet go for a toss. But there is a way to ramp up on these delicacies and not worry about the numbers on your weighing scale. For the health-conscious among us, there are baked modak and sugar-free ones. The stuffings too have become less stuffy over the years. From grated beetroots, diced carrots mixed with coconut, oats, and fruit fillings, the modak season in the past few years has given itself a healthy twist.In all this excitement about the modaks, what is often times taken for granted is the little known and often overlooked delicacy called Nivagrya or nivagria. Typically made during the ten days of Ganesh Chaturthi, nivagrya are little savoury, steamed patties made from leftover ukad (rice flour dough) that was made for the modak casing. The leftover dough is kneaded together with fresh coriander, cumin seed powder, coarse green chilly paste, a bit of oil and salt, flattened, and steamed. The little patties are eaten with plain curd or a bit of peanut oil and are absolutely wholesome and delicious.Barely has the Ganpati festival got over and the monsoons gave a firm send-off, when a host of festivals come chattering around the corner, starting with the nine-day Navratri Fest. And for epicureans, this means a nine-day food fest despite the fasting that most people do during the period. As I prepare for a dandiya-ras deluge to hit the city, I am looking forward to savoring delicacies like aaloo mewawale, kacche kele ki chaat, singhaade ke pakode, singhaade ka halwa, kuttu ki puri, and fried arbi ki sabzi.But thats a blog for another day!"
5904952a7be9e04154df8db7,Food diet tips to have a healthy fetal heart growth,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/your-fertility-friend/food-diet-tips-to-have-a-healthy-fetal-heart-growth/,2016-10-05,"In September, World Heart Day is celebrated to spread awareness about cardiovascular diseases. Having a nutritious diet to fuel their hearts and power their lives should be important for everyone, especially for pregnant women. A nutritious diet plays a key role in improving your fetals cardiovascular system. Your fetus also requires omega-3 fatty acids and essential vitamins and minerals like in the case of adults. The fetal heart development commences in the first trimester of pregnant women, thereby every pregnant woman should follow a diet rich in calcium and phosphorus, which are important for your babys heart growth. I would suggest all would-be mothers to consult a nutritionist or dietician as soon as they become pregnant to have a safe pregnancy and healthy baby.Fetuses in the womb have bigger hearts in the 1st and 2nd trimester compared to the surrounding organs. As your baby grows, the heart increases in size. The nutrition of the fetus is connected with that of mother. Hence, pregnant mothers should steer clear from caffeinated, excess sodium and high cholesterol products, which may hinder your fetals heart development.What are the factors affecting my fetuss heart development? Chromosomal abnormalities: In 50% of babies, chromosomal abnormalities are associated with Down syndrome. Other genetic defects: A single gene may develop abnormally leading to development of a congenital heart defect. Diabetes: Unstable blood sugar control in women with diabetes can be a cause of increased risk of heart defects in baby. Rubella (German measles): Luckily, Rubella is a rare disorder nowadays, however obstetricians advise to test for rubella to confirm whether the mother is protected against German measles in the early pregnancy phase. Drugs or substance abuse Exposure to unwanted chemicals: Paints, solvents, pesticides; air pollutants like trichloroethylene; and possibly, deadly radiations should be avoided. Common Heart ProblemsHeart defects are a rare phenomenon. Only around 8 in 1,000 pregnancies are diagnosed with heart abnormalities. Only around 8 in every 1,000 pregnancies are diagnosed with heart abnormalities.Which are the best foods for my fetal well-being?Pregnant women should have regular intake of diet rich in whole grains, leafy greens and lean proteins. However, in some cases, expecting mothers may emphasize rich mineral and nutrient foods. The most critical minerals that significantly impact the fetal heart development are calcium, copper, phosphorous and thiamine. Milk is rich in calcium and can be taken daily in quantities of 1,000 and 700 milligrams respectively. Have at least 1 milligram of cashews, kidney beans daily since they are great sources of copper. Lastly, eat around 1.4 milligrams of oats, split peas and meat mostly, meat products are rich source of thiamine.Which foods lower fetals heart development? Unhealthy foods High cholesterol Highly caffeinated productsIn addition to increase consumption of heart-healthy foods, limit unhealthy eating, keep a check on your cholesterol and sodium intake, which should be below 300 and 3,000 milligrams per day, respectively. Food additives or chemicals like MSG can have side effects on your developing baby. You can also seek further advice from your concerned doctor.PostpartumOnce your baby is born, his heart simultaneously grows along with other body organs. Furthermore, eat fish, salmon, tuna and flaxseeds due to its omega-3 fatty acids properties that safeguards heart from antioxidants.Closing ThoughtsPregnancy is one of the most vital and delicate phase in every womans life. Every woman should pay special attention to her diet and steer clear from foods that are harmful for your baby. Moderation is the key, have everything but in limits. Most important, drink milk 2-3 times a day, take adequate nutrient supplements and enough rest. Dont panic and enjoy the beautiful journey as would-be mother."

According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a forum for disseminating and sharing technologies for agriculture sustainability and development, the acreage under GM crops declined for the first time after the commercialisation of GM crops in 1996.The acreage under GM crops, also known as genetically modified or transgenic crops, which had steadily grown to touch peak levels of 181.1 million acres in 2014, dropped by one percent to touch 179.7 million hectares in 2015. This was mainly on account of the fall in acreage under important GM crops like Maize and cotton. This is a major setback because acreage under GM crops had shot up almost 100 fold from the meagre 1.7 million hectares in the last 19 years, making it the fastest adopted agriculture technology in recent times.Latest estimates show that GM crops were raised on 28 countries which is home from 4 billion people of which 8 were developed countries and the rest from the developing world. However the bulk of the 180 million hectares under GM crops were concentrated in five countries which accounted for 90% of the acreage and included the United States (39%), Brazil (25%), Argentina (14%) and India and Canada with 6% each. However, in China the most populated nation which stood 6th in the hierarchy, the share of GM crops was a mere 2% of the global total. But what is exceptional is the acreage under GM crops in developing countries has exceeded that of developed countries for the fourth consecutive year which raises hopes of increasing its acceptability in poor countries.In the United States the vast majority of the GM acreage was under three crops namely maize, soybean and cotton where the high technology variety covered more than 90% of the sown area each. The scenario was similar in Brazil and Argentina too where the three were the most popular GM crops. In Canada the largest GM crop was Canola followed by maize and soybean while that in India was mainly cotton. In China too cotton reigned supreme followed by papaya.The United States not only had the largest acreage under GM but also had the most diversified one. The number of GM crops including, apart from Maize, soybean and cotton, also canola, sugar beat, alfalfa, papaya, squash and potato. And 2015 was also a notable year for GM crops in the United States as it commercialised a new strain of potato and a new version of canola and secured approval for two varieties of apple.The year was also important for United States as salmon secured approval to become the first GM animal for commercial production. It also secured approval for a new GM chicken. The GM community also was able to foil efforts to introduce labelling for GM crops in four states. However, despite all this it was the fall in acreage of 2.2 million hectares under maize, cotton and Canola, due to the falling prices that cause the global acreage to fall for the first time.A country attempting a significant push to GM crops among developing countries is Bangladesh. Though the commercial acreage is still low the area under bt-brinjal has been doubled to 25 hectares and efforts are on to exponentially increase the quantity of bt seeds to meet growing needs. The country has also stepped up efforts to initiate field trials of blight resistant potato in the next year and also initiated measures to evaluate crop like bt cotton and golden rice in field trials. All this indicate that the fall under acreage of bt crops is an aberration and would be reversed in the coming years."
590495767be9e04154df8e36,Sugar Daddy: Here’s proof that the food industry has manipulated us into unhealthy diets,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/sugar-daddy-heres-proof-that-the-food-industry-has-manipulated-us-into-unhealthy-diets/,2016-09-15,"Conflicting food studies leaving you confused? Dont know whether a low-carb diet or a low-fat diet is healthier? Cant figure out if processed foods are as nutritious as fresh produce? You are not alone. Giants of the food industry have long been using marketing techniques to influence our dietary choices. And finally we have concrete proof that the American sugar lobby paid scientists in the 1960s to play down the link between sugar and heart disease while promoting saturated fat as the culprit instead. Recently discovered internal sugar industry documents show that a trade group called Sugar Research Foundation  known today as The Sugar Association  paid three Harvard scientists to publish a handpicked 1967 review of research on sugar, fat and heart disease in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.This kind of influence peddling continues till date, albeit in a more sophisticated form. Theres much literature on how the food industry has influenced governments nutritional guidelines to ensure that their coffers and consumers waistlines keep expanding. Then theres the food industrys weapon of mass destruction  children. By directly targeting kids, food companies have masterfully leveraged their nagging potency to get their parents to increasingly spend on junk foods. After all, sugary foods for children can be as addictive as drugs.Theres much reason to surmise that growing cases of childhood obesity and increasing lifestyle diseases such as diabetes are due to an environment where food companies have manipulated food research. Going forward, such food studies should compulsorily disclose their sources of funding. This bring us to the question  what should people actually be eating for a healthy diet? Unfortunately, this too can be quite confusing. At a time when air, water and soil have been polluted, nothing looks truly safe for consumption. Didnt a sage of the modern era advise us, Stay hungry. Stay foolish?"
5904957e7be9e04154df8e44,“The obesity problem is a more complicated one than tobacco”,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/the-obesity-problem-is-a-more-complicated-one-than-tobacco/,2016-09-12,"Chronic disease has emerged as a serious public health problem in the developing world. It might seem counter-intuitive as infections rage and under-nutrition continues to extract a terrible price. However, as World Health Organizations research shows, 80% of chronic disease deaths occur in low and middle income countries.Kenneth E. Thorpe a health economist at Emory University in US has studied this problem extensively and is a member of the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease, an organization of patients and health policy experts, among others, which works on raising awareness of the problem.On a recent visit to India, Thorpe spoke about the issue. Edited excerpts.WHO has identified chronic disease as a growing problem in low income countries such as India. Doesnt it seem counter-intuitive as infections have been seen as the problem?If you look at India and China- these are two good examples- as their economies have grown what you have seen is movement of people from rural areas to urban areas. What has happened in the transition is you have a change in diet, exercise, eating patterns, nutrition patterns. You have seen obesity rates in both countries go up. They are the two leading diabetes countries in the world. But a lot of this is related to changes in lifestyle. The good news is that we can potentially prevent most of these.Twenty years ago did research anticipate that low income countries would have huge Non Communicable Disease (NCD) problem?No. Even in the United States, this issue did not take off till about the late 1980s. In US between the mid-1960s and 1980s the obesity rates were constant. Between 1980s and today, it (obesity rates) has doubled. It is kind of similar to other countries as well.Low and middle income countries face two simultaneous challenges. They face a challenge from infectious disease and also lifestyle disease. How did US and Western Europe deal with challenges?We are still in the middle of the transition. Until the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, our system was largely reactive. We had a health insurance system that was really good for paying for things once you were sick. It was terrible for paying for things that prevented you from getting sick in the first place. But the Affordable Care Act is moving us in that direction. We have to set up clinical preventive services that are free. We have ongoing discussions about how to build delivery system models that really work the patients at home. Most of the care needed to manage these conditions is outside the hospital. How do we (build) a model like that? It doesnt necessarily need to be physicians. It could be nurses.In the United States, $3 trillion is spent; 86% of it is linked to chronically ill patients. We probably spend less than 3% of the healthcare dollar on prevention. The best part of the health reform that is ongoing is to have the 3% be bigger and have the whole pie get smaller. When you integrate health services with social services, the combination of these two do a better job of keeping populations healthy.In India, you had worked out some numbers on enhancing the level of healthcare spending. Take us through that.In India, we think it needs to go up to 6 to 7% (of GDP from current level of around 4%). So, it is a combination of ramping up the public side and private side.How do we get more public investment? What are the options? People are throwing out on the table things like more of a dedication of the tobacco tax to go directly in healthcare. Or, using all these sin taxes collectively. Or income related surcharge to help fund it.On private side, (have) broader insurance. Better insurance for not just inpatient care but primary care and outpatient care.How has Indias approach been in relation to other emerging markets when it comes to tackling non communicable disease?NCD is a challenge because if you think of the sense of urgency we have with HIV or once the link came up between tobacco and cancer, that is immediate. There was a sense of urgency to do something on that. NCDs are a little bit different because it is not a mortality issue, it is a morbidity issue. Part of our challenge to get movement here is to get a sense of urgency. The economic impact is enormous. So we presented data from different studies today (in a meeting with government officials) that looked out over the next 20 years and showed the lost GDP growth, lost productivity and higher healthcare spending to be about $2.5 trillion between now and 2030. This is not just confined to the health sectors, it has big implications for the growth of the Indian economy.Kerala has just started off on a fat tax. What has been the experience of similar taxes elsewhere?I think the obesity problem is a more complicated one than tobacco because we know the link between tobacco and cancer. So, if you dont want to smoke or chew tobacco, you tax the heck out of it.On the food side it is more complicated because the root of it is changing peoples behavior. You are not get sustained results unless you change peoples behavior. You can temporarily change where they get their calories from, but if you are not going to change their eating behavior and exercise behaviors, I dont know if at the end of the day how much effect it will have.The good news about it is it can be used as a source of funding for expanding the coverage on public sector side. The heart of this is really changing peoples behavior.Is sugar being treated as tobacco was 20 years ago?What is even worse is salt. Just because what we are learning about the underlying biology of these chronic conditions is it is fundamentally linked to inflammation. And salt is major source of inflammation. Salt is a big target in the United States. And sugar."
59049f367be9e04154df970a,"IPL is serious business, milords, not the tamasha it seems",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/dharkersdilemma/ipl-is-serious-business-milords-not-the-tamasha-it-seems/,2016-04-24,"Quick! Whats the one word associated with IPL? Cricket? Wrong. The word is tamasha. Thats so in the popular imagination, and its obviously so in the minds of our higher judiciary. Why else would the Bombay high court order all IPL matches to be moved out of Maharashtra at the end of April?By now, all of us realize that the phrase judicial overreach is a purely Indian formulation: read the newspapers of other countries and you hardly ever come across these words. From ruling on deaths on railway tracks, to asking banks to give confidential information about defaulters, to banning cricket matches, our courts often take on the role of the executive, ie. the government. If our Constitution wanted a firm demarcation between the roles of the First, Second and Third Estates, the judiciary seems to cross these lines with impunity.But leave that aside for the moment. What should concern us is the attitude behind the IPL ban and why, faced with the acute water scarcity in many parts of Maharashtra, the high court singled out the T20 tournament for its attention. Just a few weeks earlier, the World T20 Cup took place in India with a number of matches in Maharashtra. Was water not used for the grounds then? What about the extensive lawns of Raj Bhavan, the citys golf courses, the grounds of Mumbai`s many private clubs? Did the courts pass strictures on them? Why didnt the court order the closure of all swimming pools  municipal, club and housing societies? They consume a lot of water for a low-priority activity. Have water cuts been imposed on industries and housing societies?And since the judiciary is taking on the role of the executive, why not look at an even bigger issue, that of Maharashtras sugarcane plantations? Sugarcane is a water-guzzling crop and in Maharashtra its cultivation is considered to be the principal reason for the severe drought because over 70% of irrigation water is consumed by sugarcane. Heres a simple statistic: it needs just over 2,000 litres of water to produce 1kg of sugar, which means 20 lakh litres to produce 1 tonne. The estimated water usage for all the 20 IPL matches in Maharashtra is 60 lakh litres. Thats three tonnes of sugar. Maharashtra produces in excess of 100 lakh tonnes of sugar per year. You do the math which the high court didnt do. If, like the high court, you want to usurp the role of the executive, you might as well do it thoroughly and go to the root causes of the problem.Instead of that, you pick the easiest target. The question is why. Why is IPL on the radar of the judiciary, apoplectic TV anchors and sundry PIL litigants. Its that one word, tamasha. Yet thats such a superficial criticism, based on the tournaments surface razzmatazz  the silly cheerleaders, the loud countdowns, the flares shot into the sky, the blaring trumpets. All this leads (subconsciously no doubt) to a kind of self-righteous indignation that people in the stadium are having too much fun. Perhaps they are. Of course they are. But why should they not?The prime reason the IPL is so successful and each stadium is packed to capacity is because the action in the middle is deadly serious. The 13 cricketers in the middle of these steaming cauldrons are like gladiators engaged in deadly battle. Bowlers are being battered, batsmen are feeling the pressure of not doing enough, fielders are flinging themselves on the field as if each run means life and death.But IPL goes beyond just the matches being played. It has brought life back into the dying game of cricket. We who know cricket, do know that Test matches are the real thing, but we also know that Test cricket itself has changed because of the shorter forms of the game: scoring rates have shot up, fielding standards are such that there are no weak fielders. IPL has also given young cricketers incredible opportunities  to show off their skills on the large stage, to play together (and learn from) international cricketers and legends of the game and get the kind of financial security, and sometimes fortunes  that they couldnt even dream about a few years ago.It doesnt stop there: the success of Indias premier cricket league has sparked interest in other games. Suddenly there is an Indian badminton league, a tennis league, and leagues in hockey, football, even kabaddi! Suddenly, for the young boy and girl with talent, whether in a large town or small, the dream of a sporting career doesnt have to be sacrificed at the altar of the textbook. Here, at last, is the possibility of a national sporting culture. And all because of IPL. Tamasha? You must be joking."

Speaking with Sugandha Indulkar, Chavan discussed current CM Devendra Fadnaviss drought management plans, shifting IPL, applying beef bans, the murders of rationalists  and the Adarsh scam:Did you lose public trust because of the notorious Adarsh scam?I dont think it affected peoples trust  as soon as i came, i ordered a judicial enquiry for the truth. As a matter of fact, i corrected a lot of wrongs prevalent in Mumbais real estate sector.I became quite unpopular because of that.In some cases, vested interests were at play  i didnt clear those files. I didnt allow anyone to get cheap government land or houses.This was part of the party high command policy that discretionary allotments should be reduced.But the party had no policy on rationalists, one was killed under your watch, Congress accused of overlooking intelligence  is targeting rationalists a game all political groups play?Dabholkar was killed when i was CM. I met intelligence agencies. Intelligence pointed towards Sanatan Sanstha  we wrote to the central government to ban Sanatan Sanstha.Central government did not ban Sanatan Sanstha  neither did they refuse to ban it.After two more murders, of Kalburgi and Pansare, reports showed similarities in the bullets fired. One Sanatan Sanstha fellow was arrested.But the investigation appears slow.Government must clarify its stand on banning Sanatan Sanstha now.Speaking of bans, Congress began the cow-slaughter ban  how can it criticise BJP now?I am against the beef ban totally. It deprives people of choice. Imposing religious values of one community on others goes against the principle of a secular state.Mere possession of beef gets you a six-month imprisonment  this is highly draconian. It also scares foreigners visiting India. Foreigners carry dry beef as a routine part of baggage.We also have a cow slaughter law. Its affected the rural economy badly. Farmers dont know what to do with aged cattle as government hasnt provided cow shelters in drought.Evaluate Devendra Fadnaviss drought management  and what are the three things youd do?First, id have repaired all water conservation structures, so maximum waters conserved. Second, id have planned for contingency  what if rains get delayed? Can supplying water to Latur by train be a regular feature? What about Solapur and Beed?Id draw up contingency plans for every district. We must avoid migration also  mass migration will spoil Maharashtras image.Another thing is massive afforestation. Today, entire Marathwada has forest cover of less than 1%. Id have planted five crore trees in Marathwada alone.Governments planning to plant about two crore trees in the whole state  its not enough.But Maharashtras drought is also due to major sugar cultivation  werent your ministers and ally NCP responsible?Sugarcanes been cultivated in Maharashtra over the last six decades.Many sugar factories are owned by political leaders.Congress could not go against its coalition partners completely  but BJP enjoys full freedom. Why arent they able to fix water-related problems?Whats your view on shifting IPL from Maharashtra?By saving eight tankers of water from a cricket ground, will government now send this to far-flung Latur and Osmanabad?Shifting IPLs a knee-jerk reaction  and a huge loss to government coffers.If theres no cricket, ban race courses, golf courses, football pitches, even wedding lawns  all these need water.Is the Centre underestimating drought?Theres a lack of seriousness. Extensive plans must be implemented with dedication.But the Centres planning to spend Rs 1 lakh crore on a bullet train  this is utter foolishness. At this stage, Indias people need irrigation, shelter, healthcare, education  not bullet trains.Such cosmetic developmental projects are unnecessary at present.Why not use that money to complete irrigation?How can the water situation be improved now?Tough decisions are called for. Every major municipal corporation in Maharashtra must install automatic water metres. Malkapur in my constituency has 100% water metres  they are running successfully.Why cant bigger towns have them? Make water metres compulsory for all Maharashtra cities. Have differential water pricing  give free water to very poor people, charge high rates to industries, five star hotels, etc  but everyone must pay for water.Wont this be unpopular?I agree but were on the brink of a severe crisis  water must be used scientifically now."

Speaking with Sugandha Indulkar, Nale discussed how drought has hit his village, why villagers are so vulnerable, why there is no help  and the IPL:Please tell us about your family.We are seven people, my parents, wife and three little daughters. Farming is our family occupation. Since the last 50 years, we have been farmers in Taluka Phaltan, Satara district. Our village is about 70 km from Satara  our life is entirely dependent on rain as theres no river nearby.Rain water gets stored in wells. Our village draws water from these.What about government water supply?Some public taps used to get water earlier  now, these taps have gone dry.We go without water for eight days at a stretch.Is drought a long-term local problem?In this region, we have monsoon from June to September  this year, there was barely any rain and so, were facing this drought.Our region faced droughts in 1972, 2004 and now in 2016  but this years drought is possibly the worst. People and animals are dying for want of water.Youre in an NCP area  has sugar cultivation been a cause?Big sugar manufacturers have lifted water directly from canals  thats caused water scarcity. There are four sugar companies in Phaltan. All are owned by big politicians.I dont know their names.What difficulties is your family facing?Wed planted pomegranate trees  all of them dried up in the scorching sun. Those trees generated an annual income of about three lakh fifty thousand rupees. So, this year, we have lost our entire income  thats why my elderly father has been forced to take up a job on a nearby construction site.But his daily wages are barely able to feed the family, leave alone get medicines for my ailing mother.The situation is really bad. Peoples crops are destroyed, theres illness, farm animals are dying.We are barely able to make ends meet. I am an arts graduate but had taken a driving job to support my family  i had to give it up to look after farming as my father has to work as a construction labourer.Without tankers, theres no water even for drinking or cooking. Buying water has become a necessity  and in the face of acute shortage of funds, we find this extremely difficult.The whole village is facing the wrath of nature and trying to survive while crops are dying.I am greatly pained when i read about farmers committing suicides  most are over-burdened by debt.Drought just destroys their hopes of repaying.Recently, Maharashtra government sent lakhs of litres as relief  did that help you?No. Most of this water was sent to Latur which is well-connected by the railway.As our village does not have rail access, we could not get any help from the government.How do you manage?We have no option but to buy tanker water. For Rs 1,500 our whole village, about 4,500 people, buys one tanker. This is emptied into the village well. All of us pull water from it.What should the administration do?Firstly, the Dohmbalkawdi dam work which remains unfinished for years needs to be completed on priority  water canals in Phaltan east are connected to this dam and the canal work is also unfinished. That too should be completed urgently.Until two years back, government used to put up animal fodder camps, chara chavanis. In these camps, we could house our farm animals and government fed them and gave them water free of cost  it used to be a great help to poor farmers.The current government has taken no such steps.Do you receive help from NGOs like Naam Foundation?No NGOs have come to our village. They mostly go to Marathwada and Vidarbha.Ours is a remote village. It has a very small vote bank compared to Marathwada.No-one looks at our plight.The IPL will shift to save water  how do you feel?IPL is a sheer waste of water  we dont have water to drink, our animals are dying. In such a scenario, organising IPL here is surely unjust.Most farmers will agree with me that IPL should be shifted out of the state."
5904b07f7be9e04154dfa766,"Didi, show some of your ‘mamata’ to Bengal’s starving tea workers",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/folk-theorem/didi-show-some-of-your-mamata-to-bengals-starving-tea-workers/,2016-04-17,"This morning when you brew your cup of Darjeeling tea, remember its made by slaves. Many of them  estimates range from 300 to 1,000 since 2002  starved to death in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and North Dinajpur in poll-bound Bengal. Meanwhile PM Modi and CM Didi celebrate achhe din.Mamata Banerjees nephew, a well-nourished fellow called Abhishek, visited some impoverished tea estates in Alipurduar, north Bengal, recently. He did not allude to poverty or starvation. Instead, he spoke about janata (people), khamata (power) and mamata (compassion, or his aunts name) to a bunch of hungry people.Over 100 tea estates in Bengal are bust. Assets have been stripped by owners. Recently, seven estates owned by Duncan Industries were nationalized to save 15,000-odd employees and get their votes. Around 52% of tea workers are women. Almost all are anaemic.In Bengals collective memory, the last instance of starvation deaths was during the Winston Churchill-devised Great Famine of 1943. Then, the flatulent British PM decided to divert all grain grown in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa to Allied soldiers fighting the Japanese. Five million people died as a consequence.This is well recorded. Satyajit Ray directed Ashani Sanket (Distant Thunder), starring Soumitra Chatterjee in 1973. In 1980, Mrinal Sen directed Akaler Shandhane (In Search of Famine) about a film crew led by Dhritiman Chatterjee, excavating the detritus of this horror. Amartya Sen researched the calamity in a much-cited book in 1982 called Poverty and Famines.Today, to look for famine, welcome to north Bengal. The science of starvation is simple: deprived of nutrients, the body becomes too weak to scrounge for food; the immune system degenerates rapidly. If theres very little water, sugar or salt, things get worse. Then anything, even common cold, becomes lethal. You die.Makaibari is a prized tea estate in Darjeeling: in a 2014 auction, one kilogram of its famous brew sold for $1,850, around Rs 1.3 lakh. In comparison, the costliest Assam tea sells for roughly Rs 230 per kg. Yet, there is no starvation death in Assams gardens; but north Bengal, including Darjeeling, is on the road to perdition. What explains this brutal contradiction?Short answer: history and politics. In the early 1800s, the British ran up a huge trade deficit with China when the Qing dynasty banned opium import from colonial India to pay for silk, porcelain, herbs  and tea. A frantic rush to find substitutes for Chinese tea, to which the memsahib was addicted, led to the discovery of tea growing wild in the Naga hills of northeast India. By mid-1830s samples landed up in the Botanical Society of Calcutta, which vouched for its quality. Thus was born the tea industry in Assam and Bengal.Its human cost was terrible: after a few years of fruitless experimenting with local Assamese, Bengali and Chinese workers (many Chinese were skilled carpenters or shoemakers, not tea guys), the Scots who ran the gardens decided it was cheaper to import workers from the Santhal parganas: modern-day Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Telangana.In his classic 1977 book, economic historian Amalendu Guha reckoned around 80% of these workers died on slave boats en route to tea estates. The rest found a terrible livelihood. Their descendants are the so-called tea tribes of Assam and the starving workers in Bengal.Today, in Assam, which produces 52% of Indias tea, the bagani or tea garden population is 20% of the total. This number guarantees them voice and political clout. They cant be ignored or starved. But tea workers are just 1.2% of Bengals 90 million-plus population. Theyre concentrated in sparsely populated northern hill districts, which elect few people to the legislature: they have little political heft.So, Assam tea workers can bargain for, and get, a minimum wage of roughly Rs 140 per day, compared to north Bengals Rs 90-95. A recent report on 273 tea gardens in Bengal demonstrated how, in 2012-13, 41 estates didnt put one paisa into employees provident fund accounts. This is a criminal offence, but who cares?One-fifth, or 20%, of every tea plantation has to be uprooted and replanted every year to maintain the quality of leaves. The Duncan gardens had been ignored for so long that tea bushes were chewed up by termites. Those leaves are worthless.Bengals tea distress is a metaphor for the rotten politics practised here. Thus, Anubrata (Keshto) Mandal, a Trinamool Congress heavyweight from Birbhum can tell media hell make voters for the opposition vanish on polling day. Till sometime ago, CM Mamata Banerjee flaunted a fake doctorate from a non-existent US university. Her education mantri, Partha Chatterjee is accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis in 2014. More than a dozen TMC honchos are on camera pocketing cash-for-favours. At least one former minister is in jail for colluding in a Ponzi scheme. But he has Didis blessings and a ticket to contest the 2016 polls. With netas like this, north Bengals hungry folk need no enemies."
5904b0ac7be9e04154dfa7b0,Coping with cupcakes,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/shweshwe/coping-with-cupcakes/,2016-04-17,"So, it happened again last night. Infact, it has been happening a lot lately. The hubby had fallen asleep while watching Arnab Goswami argue his guts out on The Big Debate.(Picture courtesy: Sandeep Takke)The remote was still in his hands, but I did not dare switch the channel. He would wake up in an instant! Arnabs voice is like a stormy lullaby that plays in our house every night. Its undoubtedly the hubbys favourite show on TV. I fondly remember the time, a few years ago, before Arnab took centre stage in our bedroom. Oh, how I miss those dayscuddling, conversations, and so on. Now if I have to say something to the hubby, I have to scream over Arnabs voice. Which is impossible! And romance? I mean, how? Is it possible to feel lovey-dovey with Mr Goswami watching over us? So, I have tried to make peace with the situation. Infact the minute I hear Arnabs voice, I magically fall into a deep slumber.But not last night. I just couldnt sleep! I could hear the hubby snoring. After all he had a hectic day at work. Suddenly I felt that urge! The same strong temptation. I tried to resist it and shut my eyes tight, hoping it would pass, but it did not. Oh no why? I went close to him and re-checked if he was asleep. Just then he smiled in his sleep. Huh? Maybe he was dreaming of something? Or someone? Oh, no! Why am I so suspicious? Maybe he was thinking about that sexy girl in the red dress, at the party we went to a couple of nights back. She had smiled at him. At that time, I had downed a few of glasses of champagne. How else to deal with the jealously? Was he dreaming of her? Now my urge grew stronger. I couldnt control it any longer. I crept out of bed and tip toed out of the room. I wish we had opted for marble instead of a this creaky wooden flooring! Thankfully, Arnab was shouting on top of his voice, so the hubby couldnt hear me sneak out.I made my way in the dark, slowly, one foot at a time. But then all of a sudden I tripped over something, and fell hard, on my face. Gosh! I hope the loud thud didnt wake the hubby. It was the lil boys football studs. OMG, these kids. Why did he have to leave them in the middle of the passage? I could feel my temper rise as I had spent all evening explaining to him that he had to be more responsible, disciplined, careful and a whole lot of other good things. I had lectured him till I lost my own voice, because he was losing pencils and erasers by the dozen. Money does not grow on trees, I had screamed for the millionth time. And you have to take care of your belongings! He promised he would, while shedding big fat crocodile tears and at that point I felt that maybe I was being too harsh on him. And then, in the next hour he left his shoes here. I was frustrated and the urge became even stronger!As I got up and recovered from the shock of the unexpected fall, I suddenly heard the tween girl scream, Ouch! Oh no, I almost forgot that she was alone in her room. The maid who brought her up for six years from when she was five-years-old to now left this morning! And I couldnt stop her. It was inevitable. But she was so good at her job, that I used to mentally remove her nazar! I was always dreading this. She told me,Didi I am getting married, and will leave for the village soon. I felt the earth move under my feet. I did not know whether I was happy from the inside (for her), and crying from the outside(for me), or vice-versa, but it was the first time I felt both emotions so strongly! How would we manage? We were so used to her. I ran towards the tween girls room. She had a stomach ache. She said it was because of something she ate in school, but deep inside I knew it was because she was upset. She missed her Deepali didi, who was more like a friend. I felt terrible for her, as I stroked her head and made her feel better. It took almost half-an-hour for her to fall asleep again. I was emotionally drained, and by now the urge was at its peak!I finally reached my destination. There was no way I could turn the lights on as the staff would know I was there. I did not want them to catch me in the act! The last couple of times I got this urge, I made them believe that there was a rat in the kitchen. But bhabhiji how can a rat open a fridge door, my Chotu asked me innocently, a couple of days back. Arey! When they are hungry they can do anything, I replied. He seemed to believe me. Phew! I opened the fridge as quietly as I could.There they were in all their glory, a magnificent sight  my butter cream cupcakes! They looked divinecaramel, hazelnut, berry, vanillammm! I quickly took the box, shut the fridge door and dashed out. I went to my favourite spot on my couch, and sat in the dark with my cupcakes. I bit into one moist and soft, sweet and satiating, sinfully chocolatey, and utterly delicious! I bit into another and another, until I finished them all! I felt a cloud of pleasure descend on me. A feeling of pure ecstasy! Everything was fine. There was no jealousy, no frustration, and no sad emotions left inside me. As I licked the last part of the strawberry icing off my lips, I was in a state of indulgent bliss. And then I went back into my bed, and fell asleep. Soundly. Almost like a baby.I woke up this morning in a huff! I was guilty. And cursed my self for what I had done last night. What was wrong with me? What a major sugar overdose? Why cant I fight this urge? Maybe it is my defence mechanism to help me cope with the pressures of everyday life? Or an escapism from the mundane nature of it all! I do get bothered and stressed with small things all the time. And this makes me so exhausted mentally. And then whether it is those cupcakes, or a tub of ice-cream, or a bar of Lindt chocolate..I just go for it! To make me feel better. It really helps! Does this ever happen with you? Where you feel like a thief in your own kitchen or a slave to your cravings to help you fight daily stress. With all the calories I had consumed  with the sugar binging  I decided it was crucial to go for my Zumba class. When I got there something struck me, that changed my attitude towards coping forever.My Zumba teacher is just 22- years-old, but in these few years, life has thrown so many challenges at him. He has been recently orphaned, as both his parents passed away, one after the other. He was struggling to make ends meet, by taking classes and dancing as an extra in movies. Then, all of a sudden his sister died while giving birth to a baby boy. His brother-in-law, still young and wanting to start his life again, did not want anything to do with this baby. Especially, since the baby was bad luck and killed his wife. So he abandoned him. My sensitive and kind Zumba teacher, brought the newborn, back with him, after his sisters funeral. The baby was now his and he would take care of him for life. From not knowing where his next meal would come from, he has to now nurture another life. But he was accepting it all with courage. He was not succumbing to the difficulties. Here he was, grooving to Cheerleader on stage! And making us all move with him. He was smiling, full of life and positive. How does he cope?It made me realise how small my issues are. And yet I get so troubled by them! People are dealing with such major problems and with so much more strength. I must learn to cope, and not get anxious. After my class I bounce back home, filled with something I cannot explain. Inspiration? Hope? Energy? I dont know what it is. But I give my hubby a wink and tell him that he has the hottest wife in the world. I pout and I pose and watch him laugh. You are crazy dont you know I only love you, he says, before he kisses me passionately and leaves for work. I cant wait for the lil boy and the tween girl to get home from school. I am going to hug them close for hours and hours. I will be more patient and loving. After all, they are so innocent and incredible! As I step into the kitchen to have a healthy de-tox vegetable juice, I see Chotu frantically setting mouse-traps filled with cheese in the kitchen corners. Bhabhiji, the rat again ate all the cupcakes last night. Arey, what a Motu! Today, I will somehow catch it, he said angrily. Dont worry, Chotu, I reply with a smile.The rat will not be back tonight. And dont call it Motu! Chotu scratched his head in confusion."

In search of a healthier diet, he identified wheat as the villain of the piece and cut it out totally from his daily food intake.By giving up all wheat products, including his two slices of breakfast toast (which according to him have a glycaemic  ie sugar  count equivalent to two chocolate bars), the doctor shed his extra weight and cured his diabetic disposition within a few months.Apparently the fault lies with the Nobel-prizewinning biologist Norman Borlaug whose genetically engineered high-yielding `dwarf wheat led to the Green Revolution in countries like India by giving a huge boost to the production of the grain.But by changing the molecular structure of wheat, the biologist unwittingly turned wheat, which had for ages been deemed a superfood, into a superbadfood which can, and only too often does, lead to obesity , diabetes, coronary problems, mood swings, chronic depression, irritability and insomnia, though the jury seems to be out yet as to whether tll make hair grow out of your eyeballs.Dr Davis admits that giving up wheat in all its forms is tougher than giving up smoking, because the grain is so inextricably a part of our daily diet, from parathas to pasta, samosas to sandwiches. But people who do give it up  replacing it with bajra, ragi and buckwheat (kutu)  apparently are rewarded with significant weight loss and other non-medicated health benefits.So is wheat, which makes bread, the staff of life as many believe?Or is it, as Davis and his followers claim, a true cereal killer? You decide which view contains the real grain of truth."

5904b18e7be9e04154dfa914,Munde’s gaffe: Politicians need to see drought as more than a photo opportunity,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/mundes-gaffe-politicians-need-to-see-drought-as-more-than-a-photo-opportunity/,2016-04-20,"Few actions epitomised the insensitivity of the political class towards farmers afflicted by severe drought than water tankers being used to sprinkle the road for Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiahs dust-free ride while visiting drought-hit areas in Bagalkot district. The state has witnessed more than 1,000 farmer suicides between April 2015 and February 2016 and nearly 80% of its taluks have been declared drought-hit. Four cabinet sub-committees were set up last week to take stock of the alarming situation but except Siddaramaiah, no senior minister has even bothered to visit drought-hit areas.Lack of empathy is an equal opportunity affliction, crossing party lines. In neighbouring NDA-ruled Maharashtra, state water conservation minister Pankaja Munde was castigated for clicking selfies while on an official tour, reviewing drought-related work in parched Latur now being supplied by water trains. Munde is also the guardian minister of Latur and Beed, among the worst affected districts. Opposition parties have accused her of not conducting a single review meeting during the previous year despite evidence of a drought-like situation in the region for months.Maharashtras water scarcity is primarily man-made due to lopsided agricultural priorities. Though sugarcane is cultivated in just 4% of total cultivable area, it consumes nearly 70% of irrigation water in the state. Almost all major state politicians, cutting across party lines, own sugar factories. This effectively makes them water barons as well, cornering the states water resources for themselves. Successive governments have neither corrected this grave imbalance, nor have introduced long term measures such as drip irrigation, water conservation, encouraging crops requiring less water, or groundwater rejuvenation projects. Reports suggest that the ever-increasing ambition of politicians has fuelled 20 new sugar factories in dry Marathwada over the last three years, regardless of devastating consequences for the depleting groundwater table.Instead of framing policies to mitigate age-old problems, politicians have often shown their inconsiderate side with uncharitable remarks. In 2013, Maharashtras then deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had mocked water scarcity by offering to urinate in dams  before being forced to issue a public apology. Water resources minister Uma Bharti recently said its pointless to plan for drought in advance. Indias political parties need to get their act together and find solutions to the drought that plagues more than 25% of Indias population  nearly 33 crore people in 256 districts of the country."
5904b2087be9e04154dfa9a3,Sick Industry,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/sick-industry/,2016-03-25,"By convincing you of your poor health, the pharma biz is boomingThe old saying that health is wealth should be changed to ill-health is wealth. Your ill-health  real or imagined  is the wealth of the pharmaceutical industry, or Big Pharma as it is called.Big Pharma is a sick industry with a difference: it is an industry which is booming on peoples sickness. And the more people feel they are sick, the more the industry booms.Diabetes is a potentially life-threatening ailment that is alarmingly widespread in India, most worryingly among young children. Public awareness campaigns in the form of advertorials about the dangers of the disease, and preventive procedures for its treatment and therapies for its cure flood the media.But is the diabetic menace as great as it is made out? Perhaps. Or perhaps not. Growing obesity, caused by unhealthy diet and sedentary habits, has certainly contributed to the spread of diabetes.But so, it seems, has Big Pharma. A correspondent informs us that before 1997, the fasting sugar level for a non-diabetic was pegged at 140. A couple of years later a panel of experts  all consultants with Big Pharma  lowered this to 126, and immediately increased the global diabetic population by 14%.In 2003, the American Diabetic Association, also an affiliate of Big Pharma, once again raised the bar by lowering the permissible sugar level to 100. At once the number of potential diabetics in India increased by 100%.All thanks to the increasingly stringent standards set by Big Pharma. Which, as it happens, also supplies anti-diabetic drugs and treatments.Earlier, in the 1970s, a similar strategy had been devised to highlight the health hazards of cholesterol, and simultaneously promote the sale of anti-cholesterol statins, which can cause irreversible muscular atrophy and memory loss.Are we really so unhealthy, with diabetes or anything else? Or is our supposed ill health part of the global pharmaceutical industrys sales strategy based on the saying: An ailment a day, keeps Big Pharma in pay. Or, considering its potential for harm, should Big Pharma be called Big Harma?"
5904c7bb7be9e04154dfbb2a,India’s first battle of rosogolla,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/from-the-fence/indias-first-battle-of-rosogolla/,2016-03-28,"The sabre-rattling between Odisha and West Bengal has started for a place of pride at the top of the gastronomical pecking order. A bitter war is said to be raging between the two over a sweet. Odishas chutzpah in trying to pip the Bengali pride to the saccharine post has the latters dander up. The sweet Bengali Bhadralok is up in arms over Odishas claim that the sultan of Indian sweets, the legendary rosogolla originated in Odisha and not in Bengal. Well, how dare they could even fancy such a blasphemous thought? And the said battle is being spearheaded by none other than the Government of Odisha which has already moved to obtain a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for our rosogolla. The GI label, if granted, would fix Odishas Pahala as the place of origin for rosogolla on the basis of myths and available literature.This only means that Bengalis would no longer be able to boast of having invented the rosogolla, which, they strongly believe, is a delicacy synonymous with Bengali ontology in the wider world. Ahem! The turn of events is indubitably cruel for Bengalis, coming as it does at a juncture when rosogolla is all set to cross the known boundaries of its fandom to subsume outer space. Desiccated canned rosogolla reportedly feature in the menu of Indias first manned mission to moon by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) sometime in near future. The rosogolla factories across Bengal have not only served the national palate across the country in its multi-flavoured avatars, but have also provided gainful employment to hundreds of thousands of people across the country.What is at stake here is not just Bengals continued gastronomical hegemony in the world of bonbons, but also souring of a longstanding rapport between two neighbours. Odishas encouragement to the putative division  as opposed to integration, which the soothing taste of rosogolla ought to inspire  between the people of the two states by asking for the sweet to be identified exclusively with Odisha is something the Bengali Bhadralok refuses to accept.The twist in the tale is the fact that Odias themselves are divided over rosogollas origin. The rosogolla in Odisha traces its origin not only to Pahala, but also to Salepur near Cuttack due to the culinary skills of a confectioner called Bikalanandar Kar. The rosogolla connoisseurs suggest that the Pahala and the Bikali rosogollas are very different in taste and preparations even if they belong to the same state. Now, who can say with certainty that the Pahala rosogollas are more authentic than its Bikali variety? The GI tag requirements warrant that all attributes of a particular product are to be traced to the place of its origin. The residents of both these places namely Salepur and Pahala would like to claim the parentage to rosogolla, which itself feels juiced out in this tug of war. The wiseacre suggests these two Odisha places to first battle it out between themselves before challenging West Bengal.The modern recipe of rosogolla preparation traces its genesis to a legendary Bengali confectioner from Kolkata called Nobin Chandra Das. It is he who is said to have first made the spongy rosogolla in 1868 by boiling the mixture of chhena and semolina balls in the sugar syrup in contrast to the mixture sans semolina in the original rosogolla in his sweet shop at Sutanati (present day Baghbazar), thereby also giving it a longer shelf life to make it a better commercial proposition. Even though the descendants of Das, who is often credited as the inventor of this royal Bengal sweet, claim that his recipe was original, another school says that Das only modified the traditional Odisha rosogolla recipe to produce its less perishable extant mutant. Whatever be the outcome of this dispute, one thing is certain that Nobin Chandra Das is to the confectionary what Steve Jobs is to the Smart Phone. As Shakespeare would have said, call the rosogolla of any origin, it would taste as sweet.On a different note, one suggests treatment of the instant subject in a larger perspective with a view to resolution of differences which divide our dear rosogolla and makes its sweet taste bitter. As they say, only those cry over souring split milk who dont know how to make rosogolla out of it. After all, our cosmonauts munching on spongy rosogolla while levitating in outer space would hardly bother about its origin or a bitter fight on terra firma down below. For them, the divine flavour of rosogolla is enough to make them tearful while making them nostalgic about their motherland. The gooey emotions oozing out of this bitter battle over the legendary rosogolla ought to be resolved sooner than later."
5904c8377be9e04154dfbbcd,"Dogs of War, version 2.0 (The Arabian Sea)",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Dehati-Aadmi/dogs-of-war-version-2-0-the-arabian-sea/,2016-03-15,"Frederick Forsyths epic book The Dogs of War evolved out of his own experiences in Biafra. It was then made into a movie which was as close to the truth as what many of us seafarers saw all over the world. Where private armies on behalf of corporates, crowns and countries with clout, chose to ride rough-shod over other weaker countries, reveling in later day versions of gunboat diplomacy.In that era, stronger countries subdued weaker nations for everything from agricultural products like sugar to fossil fuels to minerals and ores. In this day and age, add the potential of a country like India challenging the global equation with a younger and smarter population. Has to be stopped, and one way is to encourage internal strife and civil war. One of those ways is to let loose the dogs of war on Indias coast, too, selling guns and killing people at will and on whims and fancies. Ex-soldiers go into such theatres knowing fuly well the score  and are well-paid too. The typical maritime guard on a merchant ship is often paid more than the Master or Chief Engineer of the ship.But sometimes, thing dont work out the way they were supposed to, as with the recent Seaman Guard Ohio episode. The navy, coast guard and police in India get together to stop this kind of attack on India too.The armed mercenaries in Dogs of War were left eventually buried in unmarked graves somewhere. Still happens in some countries. In some countries, for example, they end up incarcerated inside cages in territories which are in the grey areas as far as nationalities go. In some other countries they are publicly dispatched by rope or bullet or worse. In India, however, if caught, they go to jail and face the Indian justice delivery system. Whether it was the Purulia arms drop or the Enrica Lexie shooting of fishermen off Kerala, cases drag on which is a downside but the upside is that others will think a hundred times before trying to push their agendas too close to India or in Indian waters.But then, while dead men tell no tales, prisoners are able to drum up support and misinformation becomes the name of the game.Here in India, the ex-soldier private foreign mercenaries incarcerated along with seafarers from the Seaman Guard Ohio in Tamil Nadu jails, are trying to drum up support using not just European Union and British resources, but also resources provided by the International Transport Workers Federation or ITF Seafarers as it is more commonly known. The ITF, incidentally, is largely funded out of income generated by third world seafarers that it is supposed to protect or represent.So what is the real issue behind the Seaman Guard Ohio?1) Floating arms and ammo supermarkets, successors of the gun-runners of yore, are not unknown in the Indian Ocean. They have been there for centuries but never has the demand for their wares and the ease of communication been that brisk. Sure, those powers who want to listen in and keep an eye on the goings on do so, but now India has also evolved the capabilities and our forces do have a good idea of what vessel is doing actually what in and around India.2) The Seaman Guard Ohio is not your average merchant or fishing vessel. It started life as Seaward Defence vessel in Japan and then was supposed to be scrapped but re-surfaced in Indian waters painted suspiciously like a naval and coast guard vessel. The super-structure is that of a warship and seafarers as well as illiterate fishermen will not be wrong if they are stopped mid-sea assuming it to be a government warship of some sort.3) Combating piracy, which the people and supporters of the crew and mercenaries on board claim was the role of this ship, is a many hued business. Ex-soldiers paid huge amounts to work on board such floating armouries are not averse to doing some private trucking themselves, nor are they averse to the idea of doing target practice on humans, as has been suspected in the Enrica Lexie case.4) Freedom of navigation even near the coast of a country is premised on the simple fact that the vessel is engaged in innocent passage. Carrying armed private guards, ex-soldiers or otherwise, does not fit into this description. As a simple matter of fact, while the Master or Captain of a ship is responsible for adhering to these conventions of free passage, in actual fact it is the man on board with the gun who calls the shots.5) The Seaman Guard Ohio flew the flag of Sierra Leone. That is the operative nationality of the ship. Nationality of seafarer on board is also relevant. But nationality of the armed mercenary, dogs of war? By rights that is not relevant.The larger issue here is this  the armed ex-soldiers can not and should not be tried as merchant seafarers. They should be tried under a separate category. Of enemy combatants working in Indian territory without the protection of a legitimate uniform and under another countrys flag. Under the rules of war against India."
5904d2d77be9e04154dfc559,Kingfisher saga: a poster child that highlights the problem of NPAs,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/inside-politics/kingfisher-saga-a-poster-child-that-highlights-the-problem-of-npas/,2016-03-11,"In 2010, I started taking up the issue of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and the cosy nexus between borrowers and the powers that be, that had transformed the banking system into a taxpayer-funded piggy bank for the connected few.The Gross NPAs then, stood at Rs 54,179 crores ($10 billion). 6 years on, this number has now ballooned to more than Rs 4 lakh crores  an 800% increase. That is the cost of negligence and ignoring a problem because of which each and every taxpayer is on the hook for Rs 1.2 lakhs each.In addition to the obvious reckless politically directed lending like the unsecured IDBI loan to Kingfisher, there is ample evidence of negligence on part of the then government. In 2013, I had written to the then finance minister P Chidambaram highlighting the fact that only 10 groups in India account for Rs 5.5 lakh crores of debt which is 98% of the entire banking system. This was an unprecedented concentration of risk and credit, but next to nothing was done either by Government or RBI. This obviously was the fertile ground in which a reckless company like Kingfisher was allowed to access credit, ending up owing and defaulting up to Rs 7000 crores to a consortium of almost all taxpayer-owned Public Sector Banks (PSBs).No one, including someone publicity-crazy like Vijay Mallya, would be happy being a poster child for the rotten banking system  a far cry from pretty models, fancy cars, swimsuit models and F1. But unfortunately for him, the Kingfisher saga is perfectly emblematic of the rot in our banking system.The saga is tailored to describe the problem  a rich, high profile businessman, starting a high-risk business, using his political connections to get dollops of credit from government banks. Managing it incompetently, running it to the ground while his competitors grow, get the banks to restructure and convert some of the loans into equity at exorbitant prices that cause banks to lose money from day one. Make his employees work and not pay them and utilise Provident Fund and TDS illegally etc. without missing a beat, and then duck the personal guarantee liability of loans by blaming government policies for the business failure, and being unchallenged by passive banks and a banking regulator RBI till the media goes hysterical.NPAs  clear and present danger to tax payers and economyOver the last 6 years, I have repeatedly spoken about NPAs and this culture in our banks as a clear and present danger to taxpayers and our economy. Almost every Budget speech in Parliament of mine mentioned this. There was little urgency in response of both media and government. It was clear to me that there needed to be a broader realization that these were not victimless crimes, and that the victims were taxpayers who needed to get involved in this discourse.Thanks to the Kingfisher Airlines saga, the media and taxpayers are finally beginning to take notice of this problem and understand its severity. This issue is not limited to Vijay Mallya alone, but points to be a bigger rot in the system.There are tough questions which need to be asked. Why did the banks wait so long to take severe action against him? Between 2009 and 2012, Kingfisher Airlines had posted a loss of Rs 6000 crore and a debt of Rs 7000 crore. According to Vijay Mallyas own admission in his open letter, he says, that he alone is not to be blamed as the banks knew the financial position of his company and still decided to lend him money. Banks like IDBI and their amazing loans that look and feel like gifts, need to explain their generosity!While the 17 banks and their managements wake up belatedly to their jobs  the more serious questions that need asking must be asked!RBI failedWhat was the RBI as the Banking regulator, doing when the NPA problem was evolving into a $80-100 billion train wreck? Why was RBI silent during this unprecedented concentration of risk that have created companies and groups too big to fail and systemic risks? Who is responsible for putting this on the heads of the taxpayers of the country? What was the role of the Boards of these banks in how the loans were overseen and went bad in so many corporates?They need to be accountable to the taxpayers as taxpayers are the ones who are left holding the bill of all the write offs. In the last three financial years, a total of Rs 1.14 lakh crores worth of bad loans were written off by 29 PSBs, which is more than what they had written off in the last nine years. These write-offs point to the rot in PSBs. Majority of this money is owed by flashy billionaires whose philosophy seems to be  It is not in our principle to pay interest, nor is it in our interest to pay the principal. This is a rot that has been developed in the last decade of government-mandated lending and crony capitalism.That the Public Sector banking system requires a cleanup is no longer in doubt. Its that it requires a total restructuring and cleanup.The government in its Budget has announced steps which would systematically re-architect PSBs. The government has provided Rs 25,000 crore for the recapitalization of banks in its Budget, which many in the Opposition have said is too little to fill out a Rs 4 lakh crore hole. I think it is a very wise move by the government as it understands that it can no longer divert taxpayers money to bail out banks for their bad decisions without answering tough questions. I had urged in my Budget speech of 2014-15 in Parliament, that capitalization of PSBs must be accompanied with deep restructuring and reorganizing of these banks and how they are managed.The Narendra Modi government  in sharp contrast to UPA government  has responded and moved on this  taken on structural changes like the announcement of Banks Board Bureau; expediting the implementation of the Indradhanush plan; addressing borrower issues by addressing structural and regulatory issues in stressed sectors like power, coal, highways, sugar & steel; amendment in the SARFAESI; and bringing the Insolvency and the Bankruptcy Code bill.Banks must be able to step in and change managements when faced with mismanagement to protect the business and employees. The passage of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill, when done, will ensure this power is available to banks and avoid a repeat of the Kingfisher saga, where both Banks and employees got stiffed with the death spiral of the Airline because of an incalcitrant management.But I believe we need to move faster and more urgently than at present. I believe that the current NPA trainwreck will get only worse if theres no surgery now. I would argue that government not rely on organically growing out of this problem, but rather create a Public ARC for all bad loans which will allow banks to focus on lending, rather than recovery of stressed assets. Consolidation of Bad Loans can simplify resolutions. A Public ARC made by political will and backing and with the support of RBI can lead to faster resolution of NPAs.The Kingfisher/Mallya saga is the beginning of the end of the old system that was marked by crony capitalism and use of banks as private piggybanks. The banks will find that the new order will seek far more transparency and accountability from their shareholders  the taxpayers; and that in turn the borrower has to live with the new reality that the same rules apply to all borrowers. For Vijay Mallya who may feel hes being unfairly picked on alone when there are other bigger fishes  thats a detail that will get lost as the tide turns."
5904e3237be9e04154dfd3a8,Figure it out: The great mystery of India’s GDP,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/figure-it-out-the-great-mystery-of-indias-gdp/,2016-02-24,"The first time i heard of it, i thought that what people were talking about was something called geedeepee. What was this geedeepee that everyone was getting so het up about?It sounded like some sort of path test, like for checking sugar levels in pee. That apart, i had no idea what it might be. But then, neither did most of the people who were carrying on about it.Much later i learnt that geedeepee is actually GDP, and is a term in economics that stands for Gross Domestic Product, which means the total value of all the goods and services that the country produces each year. GDP growth is an indication of a countrys economic health, or lack of it, and we get to hear a lot about it, particularly at Budget time.The funny thing about GDP growth  or at least Indias GDP growth  is that no one seems to be able to figure it out. Or, rather, everyone literally figures it out by coming up with a different figure for it.Indeed, Indias GDP seems to have more growth numbers than a telephone exchange. And the more numbers that are tagged onto it, the number they make our minds  or in any case my mind.Youll hear a panel of economic experts talking about GDP growth on television. Itll sound as though theyre playing Tambola, each one rattling off a string of numbers: 7.3, 7.5, 6.8, 6.7, 7.6, blah, bloo, blah.GDP numbers grow in proportion to the time allowed to them. The more time we spend talking about our GDP, the more the numbers well attribute to it, depending on whos doing the enumerating: the PMO, the finance minister, the opposition, international financial agencies, your next-door neighbour who is the bhatija of a friend of someone who knows a guy whose son-in-law is a peon in the RBI.Which raises the question: Does all this talk about GDP contribute to GDP, or detract from it? Maybe its time GDP came to stand for Guaranteed Divergent Predictions."
5904e35b7be9e04154dfd3f4,Remembering former prime minister Morarji Desai on his 120th birth anniversary,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/voices/remembering-former-prime-minister-morarji-desai-on-his-120th-birth-anniversary/,2016-02-29,"Jogging memories of family members, wiping the dust off his autobiographies, speaking to his well wishers and peers is what pushed me to revive Bapujis name. It is astonishing, to say the least, how differently people who knew him closely, remember him as opposed to the opinion that the general public share. The stereotypes that defined Morarji Desai seem to fade away once you got to know him.A stubborn man with a stern demeanor, a man who stuck to his ideas and principles regardless of the situation and a man of obstinacy and discipline that lived almost a century. This is how history remembers Morarji Desai.But should it be just that?This year we remember Bapuji, as we call him at home, on his 120th birth anniversary. Though he had only 25 birthdays since he was born on the 29th of February, he lived up to the ripe old age of 99. To put things into perspective, he was around during the World War I and II, was a freedom fighter in the Indian Independence struggle and the Nav Nirman movement and also lived long enough to see his finance secretary, Dr. Manmohan Singh liberalize the countrys economy.It was supposedly common knowledge that once Morarjibhai had made up his mind, it was impossible to change it. Right or wrong he stuck by it regardless of the situation. History will cite many situations to prove the same. But this was quickly dismissed by Shanti Bhushan, the law minister in his cabinet and practicing senior advocate at the Supreme Court of India, in his conversation with me, When a cabinet minister had a view which differed from Morarjibhais, he didnt impose his views and dismiss it. If logic and reasoning was shown then he would go with the opinion of the minister and not his own.What was confused for being adamant was his deep-rooted belief in what was right and wrong. Good and bad. Bapuji always stuck by his core principles. They werent founded on a whim; they grew from the struggles through his life at a very young age, his mentoring and inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi and his devotion to God. In fact, he knew the Bhagavat Gita verbatim and always turned to it when in doubt.Reputed journalist, Karan Thapar in one of his columns once called Morarji Desai the most hated man in Doon School when he came to visit in 1968 as the chief guest. Why? Because he insisted on delivering his speech in Hindi and criticized the boys for shaking his hand instead of the traditional NamasteAs a nationalist, Bapuji insisted that we as a nation should not lose our ethnic culture. It was his firm belief that our culture set us apart as a people. He travelled extensively and would boast of our rich heritage and culture every chance he got. He led by example, by wearing Khadi he spun himself, speaking only in Gujarati at home and eating simple vegetarian food besides praying, practicing yoga and reciting the Gita everyday. However he never imposed his personal belief on his family members, and for generations we have been allowed to attend English medium schools and be children of our respective times. At the same time, Bapuji would make his opinions known and felt, like he did in Doon school. Hated or not, it wasnt his concern. However something that he thought was not in the best interest of the nation, was his concern.Ask anyone close to Morarji Desai and the one thing that made him stand apart from mere mortals was his undying will power.Bapuji went on a fast four times in his life; every time was a fast unto death for a cause that was worth dying for. 1974 was one such incident when the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi refused to dissolve the Gujarat assembly which had lead to a non-political student agitations and continuous, wide spread violence all over Gujarat. On the fourth day of his fast, the advisor to the Governor, Shri Sarin came to communicate to Morarjibhai that the assembly would be dissolved. Bapuji was elated, he walked down from his room in the Gujarat Vidhyapith guesthouse to address the overwhelming crowd that had come to see him. He spoke to them and conveyed the good news, the crowd was ecstatic, but right after his speech, some students in the crowd found out that Shri Sarin was in Bapujis room and started shouting continuously We want Sarin, we want Sarin. Bapuji was afraid that if the crowd got to him, he would be hurt. So he stood at the entrance of the guesthouse, blocking their way  25, 000 people beating down on his seventy eight year old body that had fasted for four days, but he did not let anyone pass. When they managed to push him aside, he ran to the bottom of the stairwell and held the crowd from there. He did this for more than half and hour and only when it was communicated to him that Shri Sarin had escaped from the back door, did he let go.He attributed this great personal feat to the will of God.For Morarji Desai, freedom of democracy and freedom that our Constitution guarantees the people was paramount. During the dark days of Emergency, Morarji Desai was kept under house arrest. After being kept in a government house for over a year, Indira Gandhi sent one of her followers to make him an offer that she thought he would not refuse  an offer to set the political prisoners free as long as they adhered to everything she had to say. After all which man wouldnt want his own freedom before anything else? He sent the follower back to the Prime minister with a message, Keep your offers. I will outlive you anyway. He did. He strongly believed that, Material and physical comfort without human freedom is sufficient only for well-fed domestic animals and birds. It is not so for men.In the year 1978, the Prime ministers plane crashed in the forests of Assam. The pilots died on the spot, my grandfather  Kantibhais leg was hanging by a few ligaments. After being rescued, he addressed the nation, attended parliament and continued his work. About a week after the crash, my grandmother, Padmaben while attending to him saw that the left side of his chest was black and blue, his pen had pressed against his chest and cracked three ribs during the crash, he had told no one. He was 82, and still continued his work  unfazed. The media reported, Morarji unhurt.These are interesting stories of Bapuji that shed new light on his life. But what makes him relevant today is what he achieved over thirty years ago.Indias relations with Pakistan have always been strained, especially during the 1970s after the liberation of East Pakistan, so the events that unfurled at the state funeral of Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, was bewildering to say the least  The President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister India sat down to have peace talks. At this historic meeting, Morarji Desai told the Pakistani President Zia ul -Haq, There should be give and take. If we act in the interests of both our countries, there will be no conflict. We should act like brothers. I am your elder brother. I have nothing to take from you, I have everything to give. Bapuji built a relation of trust and faith with Pakistan. Both countries had a history suspicion that had to be broken  something that Bapuji understood and nurtured.But if anything happens, you will be held responsible. I am not someone who simply talks. I take action. The words of a politician are rarely binding, but this was not the case with Bapuji and the Pakistani head of state understood and respected him for it.Though building relations between the neighbour states was important, Morarji Desai was a true nationalist and would not accept any sort of compromise on the sovereignty and integrity of his nation. In fact, his relations with Pakistan were truly understood by the world in the December of 2010 when a wiki leaks cable stated that when Morarji Desai spoke to an American official, he said, If Pakistan has nuclear bombs, we will smash them! and he truly meant it. Cordial relations between otherwise sparring neighbors did not mean Morarji Desai was a soft Prime Minister, he was tough and everyone knew it. Years after Morarji Desai retired form politics, the people of Pakistan honored the first Indian with the Nishan E Pakistan, Pakistans highest civilian award.In todays context, most people who lived in late 70s India will remember Morarjibhais days as prime minster, with fond memories of affordable prices for essential. In 1977, India wasnt growing at 8% we did not have billions of dollars in reserves, But we managed to feed our people, without burning a hole through their pockets. During his premiership, the prices of essential food commodities were successfully maintained, so that they were affordable by the common man especially the price of sugar and oil that were the cheapest. People remember him as the person that made ration shops irrelevant. Unbelievable, The price of sugar and oil at the market and the ration shops were the same.These were some of his contributions as prime minister over the course of 2 and a half years, leading the countries first coalition government.True to his Gandhian roots Bapuji insisted on being among to the people even while holding the highest political office in the country.Once, while Bapuji was walking out of his residence, a young boy of 10 managed to squeeze through security, because he wanted to greet Morarjibhai. The police officer on duty apologized to Bapuji after quickly removing the boy, the police officer that did so was reprimanded. Bapuji insisted on meeting everyone that wanted to meet him, he made no exceptions; While he occupied the office of Prime Minister, he continued spending ten days in the Gujarat Vidhyapith, where he was the Chancellor. During his stay in Ahmedabad, he would address the public, first orating and interpreting the Gita, and then allowing for questions to be asked  of any nature, he answered everyone from farmers to teachers all of whom had come to attend the discourse, not just journalists. Once back in Delhi, he replied by hand to postcards that he received as Prime Minister.Bapuji believed in giving due credit where it was deserved, the driver of Bapujis car, Kishwari had served him since the very beginning of his political career. One day when he returned from the Parliament, he removed his Nehru cap and jacket and left the compound, no one, including his security knew where he was going  which was quite often the case. He was heading to the servants quarters where the drivers mother lived. He visited their house, sat next to her on a plastic chair for 5 minutes and appreciated her for raising a boy with such fine values.The people of India had given the Janata Party a clear mandate in the 1977 elections. He holds the distinction of being Indias first non-congress Prime minister and this obviously entailed a lot of in fighting, as a coalition government was unprecedented. He resigned just two and half years later on grounds that he would not hold on to power by any means necessary by wooing defectors and resorting to undemocratic means. His office as the Prime minister of India did not matter, how best he could serve the country was more important to him. And holding on to a seat of power for dear life was against the democratic principles, that he stood for.Retirement from active politics did not signal the end of the line for Bapuji. He strove to push himself, he never stopped learning or studying, like he always had and continued even up to the age of 99. At home, there would always be three newspapers in front of him and he would meet people in the evenings, to keep himself updated. Making sure he did not stay disconnected from his surroundings.After serving as Indias first non- congress Prime minister, Deputy Prime minister, longest serving finance minister and chief minister of Bombay state, he donated all his earthly belongings, including Indias highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna and the Nishan E Pakistan along with the Rs. One lakh that he made over the years to the Gujarat Vidhyapith, where they are still preserved so that they would be appreciated by the people he had worked for and not for his family to hold on to as trophies.Bapuji never compromised on his principles and integrity. At a time when no one thought it could be done, he brought disciple and credibility to the highest office of this democracy. He lived his entire life in service to a people of whom he was always one.In my eyes, his relevance in the evolution of Indian polity has become increasingly significant today. The values and principles, he strived to uphold all his live, in face of utmost adversities are the crying needs of our times.For me, Morarji Desai was more than just the Prime Minister of India."
5904e3e57be9e04154dfd4be,"Of magic, maple & memories!",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/O-zone/of-magic-maple-memories/,2016-02-28,"Unless you weave stories and create magic moments, how are you going to make good memories?Some moments stay frozen in time  and come back later to delight. Greedily we wait and plot for them to be repeated, but the truth is that you never get the same moment twice  never in quite the same way. And even if you did, you would never feel the same about it! So, the best thing to do is to savor it while it happens and record the memory for later times. And meanwhile, keep gathering the treasure of other magical moments.I knew this moment would delight me many a time in the future even as I lived through it. This one was a literally frozen moment at minus seven degrees in a rustic Sugar Shack nestled in the mountains of Brigham near Montreal. It is the beginning of Maple season and all of Canada, particularly Quebec, which supplies 80 percent of the worlds maple, goes maple-crazy. They liberally pour the golden syrup into all  from soups to cocktails to salads, eggs, dishes, desserts, and even beauty masks and medicines! And they are eager to share their maple tales  legends, recipes and the syrup.But the most fascinating experience was the celebrated Maple Snow Taffy  a moment I awaited eagerly. This is a tradition during maple season where you create simple taffy on actual snow and then  what else, lick and chew it all up! Out into the freezing air stepped Pollender Andre, the smiling patriarch of the shack, in his red plaid shirt, with a snow tray and a jug of the golden syrup. With great flourish he poured little ovals into the spotless snow, and then before these totally froze, expertly wrapped the sticky semi-frozen maple around popsicle sticks. Standing in that frozen dreamscape, the resultant taffy was possibly the best dessert Ive ever experienced, given the entire hoopla around it!But then that is the kind of sensational packaging that creates the hype for moments that click and cling. Unless you weave stories and create magic moments, how are you going to make good memories? You need to weave magic in order to create magic moments; gather stardust in order to stay starry-eyed. Remember, someone has put in an effort behind every palpable memory. And this is a trick we need to learn. Those little stories, the romance of exciting phrases and names, and the creation of legends. In India, we have all the content and the legends, but when it comes to translating these into moments that can be marketed for tourism, we lag behind dismally.Here you may just stumble upon moments and legends, but how about having these dished out to you professionally? The Canadians have maple, around which they have built an entire industry and their tourism sector. What have we done with its equivalent  honey or palm jaggery, which is a part of the very fabric of our lives?And so a cocktail in a Montreal hotel that uses a spoon of maple syrup in white wine gets called A Little Kiss  now, who can resist the name? In the middle of the wintery Quebec landscape, a rustic shack with real fire in real hearths serves a traditional lumberjack meal on wooden tables and benches  and you are told the shack has been built by the owner with his own hands using maple wood from his own land. His apple-cheeked wife has used maple in every dish she has prepared with aplomb  from pea soup to crispy pork rinds to sliced roasted potatoes, maple sausages, maple beans, salad with maple vinegar  uff! Can you forget the magic of such an afternoon?Magic doesnt always happen; quite often it needs to be created with a sense of purpose, so as to leave beautiful moments and memories. Just a visit to the Taj Mahal isnt good enough. You want to be able to get a whiff of the times, be caught up in the legends and feel the love and pain. That is what stays with you. You want to hear the voices of the time, echoing down the years and you want to have someone weave the ancient tapestry alive before your eyes. That then is magic.A lasting memory is built when pleasure meets delight and the emotions get caught up in the thrill of the moment. That is when magic happens, and that is when the memory clings, to be revisited later for thousands of lasting, delightful moments. And yes, never try to relive a memory in exactly the same way. It doesnt happen!"
5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."
5904ea987be9e04154dfdb02,What the ponkh?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/what-the-phonk/,2016-02-15,"It is a lazy winter morning in Mumbai and finally for what it is worth, there is a nip in the air and the urge to have frequent cups of garam-garam chai. I am sitting all toasty and warm in my favorite recliner when the doorbell rings and a friend sashays in, radiating bonhomie and good cheer. I have just come from Surat and look what I have for you, she exults. Diamonds? I breathe hopefully. No silly, she giggles, waving a bejeweled hand towards a box she is carrying. Its ponkh!Ponkh? I squeak.Spoiler alert: for those of you who are hardcore carnivores, there is no meat in this story!What she has got back from her recent soujourn to Surat is a Gujarati delicacy called ponkh which is the local name given to tender jowar seeds or white millets. During a brief period in the winter months, the jowar grain is juicy and very tender and the seeds are just right to be harvested and eaten roasted. It is generally picked from fields and cooked there and then, with parties thrown to celebrate this young edible seed.My friends box reveals a bunch of packets neatly packed together: the green jowar seeds, three types of sev (fried gram flour noodles) and tiny sugar granules also known as sakkar-danna. The three sevs spread out in front of me are variously colored: a yellow one which is mildly spicy, a tomato-flavored red one, and the brown one which is hot and spicy and enticingly called limbu-mari (lime and pepper). The three flavors of the sev and their sharpness offset the slightly bland and sweetish taste of the ponkh. And I guess the sakkar-danas are provided to counteract the smoke-in -the-ears spiciness of the limbu-mari. Ponkh is sometimes eaten raw and sometimes slightly roasted and Gujaratis often wash it down with glasses of chhaas or lassi. My friend informs me that die-hard lovers of this delicacy even attend ponkh picnics in Surat.In Maharashtra, ponkh is known as hurda. As a child, I remember my mother talking about the hurda parties she used to attend on her visits to her hometown of Amalner, Maharashtra. During the season, the local farmers would throw a party in the middle of the fields where the young tender jowar was being roasted and eaten directly when it was still hot and tender. To accompany the hurda, the farmers wives would provide jaggery (gud), shengdana-lassun chutney (groundnut-garlic chutney), dry khobra chutney (dry coconut chutney), wangya chi bhaji (a brinjal preparation)and taak (butter milk).So now I am sitting with this big fat packet of ponkh and after diligently mixing the three sevs and a bit of the sugar granules with the green seeds, I carefully plate it on a salad dish and serve it to the family. Unfortunately, it does not set anyone on fire. The husband grimaces, the foodie wrinkles his nose and I stoically plod through the helping I have served myself. The next day, I decide to spice up the ponkh by serving it as a bhel. I add finely chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander leaves, rock salt, a dash of chaat masala, and a few drops of lemon juice. On top, I add the rainbow colored sev, and serve it in the evening as an appetizer before dinner. The foodie son looks at it and exclaims, That thing again!My cook, the Garwahli genius, comes in from the kitchen to see what the fuss is all about. He takes a look at the ponkh offering, tastes it and then saunters off to the kitchen with something suspiciously sounding like Not on my table wafting on the breeze. With sarson ka saag and makke di roti on the menu, the poor ponkh is not getting its day under the sun in our house.Desperate to finish the huge mound of ponkh sitting forlornly in my kitchen, I call a few Gujarati friends and ask if they would want ponkh. Chokkas! Tarat mukaljo! (Of course, send at once) is the ardent response. And now, just as I am sitting back with a contented sigh that the ponkh has finally gone to places where it is being appreciated, my friend calls and asks how I liked the ponkh. Loved it, I squawk and cross my fingers for lying. Great, she chirps happily. Next year I will send you three kilos, and hangs up."
5904ebd47be9e04154dfdc3a,Incantations at midnight: Patron saints of lost things,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/writing-is-deleting/incantations-at-midnight-patron-of-lost-things/,2016-02-15,"Some Loves are fleeting ,But that which is built on you will never fail.So guide the Lovers to know what is to be. Prayer to Saint ValentineWinter was still around then and I was alone at midnight on the streets of a city with the car windows rolled down, the wind hitting my face, and Tiny Dancer by Elton John playing in my ears. Leaves danced in the breeze. Their somersaults on the grey street when a car approached reminded me of a musical I had watched long ago in a theatre somewhere. Some nights begin this way. With the sense of fleeting love, and a hope for deliverance.At the flower shops in late night, they were busy making rose bouquets. They say there are never enough roses on Valentines Day. If I could, I would buy white roses, and scatter them around in the memory of those that are no longer there. As an offering of peace. We put distance between us and the departed, and hope we never cross that bridge again. But then, I always think of such outrageous acts of charity. I never buy white or red roses. I like wild flowers, and in the city, there are none. None that I saw this night. Red heart-shaped balloons hung outside shops. It was the eve of Valentines Day.But I remembered the other saint  St. Anthony, the patron saint of lost things. I remembered an old incantation, which had been transferred to a man by his mother, and I stumbled upon it while looking up other prayers. The rest of the story of the man and his mother is not relevant. But the man wrote it worked. He found things he had lost when he called upon the saint. He didnt say if lost people returned.It goes like this  the prayer. Almost with a childlike fervour.St. Anthony, St. AnthonyPlease come downSomething is lostAnd cant be foundI repeated the words. We lose people and places in bits. Nothing is lost in whole. You dont want to wake up the dead. You dont even know what you are praying for. But prayers are good on empty streets at midnight with rolled-down windows, and some stars in the sky. You look at the haggard and hardened faces of the truck drivers and wonder if they too are invoking the patron of lost things tonight. Love and loss go together. Hence, that incantation.What was lost then? Not innocence. And as my grandmother said that you would find out whats good and whats bad when you reach that point. She said until then, it was all good. I was small then. Shes dead and gone. I am in my 30s now. And just like I understand what the poet saw when he saw the waves at Dover Beach went beyond just the waves and that beach, I know what she meant when she said whatever she said. We spend our lives trying to become a memory for others. That night I remembered her  the woman with a transparent skin whose green and purple veins ran like tributaries on her slender wrists, and neck. I remembered how she was so graceful about loss.Sometimes, we close our eyes and think of the first love stories we encountered.My grandmother was a beautiful woman. Her nose was straight and small, and her eyes seemed to have been cut in glass  reminded me of the green marble stones I played with as a kid. She was petite, and sat against a wall in the sun chewing her paan. She had been the woman who had welcomed the other woman in the household, and shared her husband with her. I hadnt known the story as a child. But children are witnesses, too. Only later, when you can distill memory until it is purified, you begin to understand that to love requires a lot of courage, and to admit defeat requires the strength of a winner. Does it make you sad? Yes, on a night when your memory offers you this story from its repertoire, you feel sad. I remember the two beds  a four poster one, and another single one  joined to accommodate the two women and the man. I guess my grandmother stayed because she understood what it meant to be abandoned. I think she was a very brave woman.She died after she lost her memory. They cut her hair short, and she looked like a lost child. An old woman named Gangajali took care of her, and the day my grandmother died, Gangajali stood outside the house, and when I returned from school, she led me to the house, and into the room where the body was lying. I dont know where Gangajali went after that. We forget facts, and dates, and fates of others. But certain scenes remain. The kaleidoscope plays on.As did the song on that night.Turning back she just laughsThe boulevard is not that badPerhaps the incantation worked. The memory is a gift, too. Stories make you brave. Someone asked me what is love on Valentines Day.I wanted to say it is about being brave. I told her the story of my grandmother.***That night I told the cafe owner about the patron saint of lost things. He smiled. Theres a reason why we remember stories. They bring back people, places, things. Theres a reason why St. Anthony was given the task of guarding the lost things.It was also the last night of this past winter. Spring had begun. We spoke about ambiguity. We spoke about my grandmother and Dover Beach. He said winter was over. He said he didnt wear his coat too often this winter. It wasnt that cold this season. It was a season of confusion, and of stories of unrequited love.This winter, I didnt wake up to the rains. I called it half-winter. It reminded me of the young man I met a few years ago in in this city, who was stuck in a half-half body, and now I have forgotten his name but I remember he had goldfish in a glass jar and when he tapped the lid, they leapt towards him. I had told the half man about my gold fish and how they died one night and had been floating in the jar when I woke up at around 3 am. He wasnt always a man, like this winter wasnt always a morphed summer. This man who I met was without a past. One day when he wasnt in this limbo like state, he had gone and removed his breasts, and scars crisscrossed his back. He had been born as a woman and always felt that he had been assigned a wrong gender at birth.He had shown me those scars just like he tapped on the jar that contained his gold fish. And I remembered my gold fish that died two days later. The half man loved a woman. But the woman wanted a man  a full man.I dont know what happened to the half man. I hope he got the money he needed to get a full sexual reassignment surgery done. But then, this half season reminded me of him looking out of his window, the gold fish swimming in a jar next to him, and outside the trees had shed their leaves, and there was a park where a few boys had been playing. I forget if it was winter or summer. But if the window was open, it must have been a time like this. It wasnt an extreme time.When I looked out of the window every morning, I saw pigeons perched on dusty wires, and workers balancing themselves on the scaffolding trying to build a house. That night, sitting in that cafe, I remembered the story of the half-man.There was no fog this winter. Or maybe I missed it.There was smog instead, and I went back to reading TS Eliots poem called the Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock. There was a strange absence of winter. Everything changes character, and as we slept in my four poster bed  me and a friend  we spoke of the memories of sweethearts and she laughed, and I laughed, and so we slept  two women in white shirts, still as hopeful, still as innocent.Like Prufrock, who walked in the streets in the smog, we had a sense of getting older, and as the jaded winter waited outside the window, we knew that maybe we were afraid for no particular reason. Like Prufrock.This winter I refused to be home, and it felt less cold outside than being in a room with lace curtains and a four poster bed that belonged to my great-grandfather and a 60-watt bulb and a map and no clock. I was never the one to keep or mark time. So, I dont know how I forgot the name of the half-man, or how I still remember the names I had given to the gold fish  Hector and Athena. I always thought they sang to me while I lay in my bed looking outside the window then.I drank too much coffee this winter, and I stayed away from things that made up this past summer. There was no dread of the biting cold. So, we thought we would keep wandering as the half-grown winter moved along.And in writing the obituary of the winter, I had finished my farewell notes to many things, and in that strange season I frequented this cafe with a tree inside, and white stucco walls. It was a place of absence and presence. The walls were bare, and the filaments cast just enough light to study faces. They dimmed it towards the end of the evening, and from the terrace, you could sometimes see the moon, and the tops of some buildings, and hear the music they played in another cafe across the little street that had two chandeliers hanging from a wire on the rooftop with a fountain that didnt work during those months. At first, they had begun painting the walls black, and then they installed the white fountain. The misplaced decadence of it was kind of charming and from this rooftop whenever I stood looking at the people laughing and swaying to the music, and the glow of the chandeliers on their faces, I longed to be part of something that was so raucous, and there I stood, a stranger with a misplaced sense of being. I stood there on my own, holding the world at bay, a cup of coffee in my hand telling stories or listening to stories.In the range of my view, there was a neon lit sign, and I first read it as Walk on the Clouds and later, when I focussed better in my delirious state, it said Wok. This half winter, I misread many signs. But those interpretations were my secrets. I fed myself on imagination.I ordered my coffee, and began my ritual of being distracted. I was testing my loyalty. The other signs beckoned. But I was out of range.Coffee, a drink most cherished but then as Orhan Pamuk wrote, it gave way to ulcers. But coffee let me be. There was the cafe, and crumbs of cake, and chaos, and stories.I believed in disruptive forces, and dismantling everything before they became a habit. Winter wasnt a habit either, but I mourned its loss, but as I read somewhere long ago, I no longer carried the nostalgia nonsense. The whole damn thing is just about the endings and the beginnings, and I knew we must be grateful for the latter.And during this half-winter, we also knew we had been innocent, and blameless. That night after the couples had left, and three people sat talking about stories after midnight, we knew we were nostalgists and fantasists, and we were carrying on the nostalgia nonsense, and it wasnt even nonsense actually. Our stories made us.That afternoon when I was leaving the caf, she was downstairs at the bleached wooden table in a green sweater, and her hair had been pulled back. I saw her, and hesitated for a moment. It had been five years, and except for a brief coffee we had, which was a bad attempt at reconciliation, we had not spoken. I went ahead, and tapped on her shoulder. There was a weak smile like that lone ray that stayed put on the ledge in the mornings. She said she was dealing with total collapse. I said she should come over to a party I was hosting that week. We hugged each other, and when I looked over my shoulder, she was sitting alone at the table. Half-winter lingered outside.On the day the world celebrates love, we met at the cafe again. She was brave. Like my grandmother. But unlike my grandmother, she had decided to leave. But she had forgiven her betrayer.***Time is always running out. Thats the way it is. But sometimes, it drags. On some nights, it feels like an eternal bowl of darkness, and you swimming in it, picking out shards of poetry, and reading it out to those that listened to them with wonderment in their eyes, and of course we read Charles Bukowski over and over again. It just goes with strange kind of winters, and its idiosyncrasies.She told me she was coming to terms with being abandoned, and in a long time, she was faced with an absence of winter, and someone she had been with for more than a decade.We all carry the burden of our freedom. She and I met at the caf on most evenings, and each evening, her hair looked different. That evening when she smiled, her teeth had been hammered into a straight line. There were new shoes that she bought, and new shades of lipstick. She started to believe that changing nail paint could take stall the downward slide of her heart, and when it goes down in the dumps, it is difficult to pull it back. We had all known this bit. We were no strangers to betrayals, and the downward slides.I changed things about me. Not for attention, but to get over the past, she said.And because it was half-winter, she sported dresses and her hair could be wild and free and unwrapped. Thats how the winter moved along. On the terrace of a caf with two women, and their battle with absence. The third was a man who seldom asked questions but listened to the stories like an eager child and brought us coffee and slices of cake. Grief needed sugar and caffeine to dissolve. He, I guess, understood.Sometime ago, the woman who slept on the red couch moved upstairs to her room. She brought flowers home, and bought many books. This winter, while I was organizing my memory, I returned to old books on my shelves, and reread them. Sometimes, I read out to them the poems I had stumbled upon in the mornings. She waited for sunshine, wore pink instead of grey, and I stuck to my black and grey. We stuck to our own solutions, and I repeated to myself and them that if we could predict the endings of stories, why begin chasing them in the first place.In their case, they were dealing with a winter of absence.This winter, the caf was the perfect place. We came when we did, and left when others had left. We lingered on this space, which didnt hold any of our pasts. For my part, I was only a listener, a gazer, and a coffee drinker.Those evenings, the other friend alternated between sadness and euphoria. The 100 days after that someone had gone were a mix of this and that. There are no prescriptions to deal with loss. Changing hair and nail colour are distractions. Sometimes, we look for miracles in the mundane. Sometimes, miracles happen.We all met on Sunday night to celebrate love, and loss. One got flowers, and the other got pastries. I told them about the patron saint of lost things. I hoped it would help them reclaim their memories, and distill stories. Distillation, a scientific process, is also a psychological process. It is also an act of faith.***Winter betrayed us, I told her. It metamorphosed into a season of longing and misplaced identities. I didnt write much. I read a lot. And mornings were dedicated to beautiful sentences written by melancholic poets, and the memories of sweethearts, and coffee. I woke up when I could no longer sleep, and thats how I spent my days.This winter when the cold was bearable, and sometimes even utterly delicious, I mourned the loss of chill on the terrace of the caf, but my sadness was mine. It was a strange sadness. It was a sadness of not having the same winter twice.And yet the sadness was sweet. It was almost like how Roman Payne wrote in the 1st Soliloquy of Rooftop Soliloquy It was a time I slept in many rooms, called myself by many names. I wandered through the quarters of the city like alluvium wanders the river banks Mine was the twilight and the morning. Mine was world of rooftops and love songs.And mine was the world of that terrace and while others mourned the loss of love, I only grieved the loss of a season.And through the days, I fed myself on poems. Bukowski kept me engaged. I mean, he wrote a book called Love is a Dog from Hell, and I read out strange lines from the book. What would they know about poetry and love unless they got fired, or hired and fired again, and drank, and drank. Have they struggled to live and love again, and on an everyday basis? And have they felt suicidal ever?Bukowski entered  stark, and unapologetic, and we struggled to keep pace with him. At any rate, Bukowski was good to make people uncomfortable. It is like dark bitter coffee with a shot of whiskey on an empty stomach. I was tired of focusing. I drank coffee, and stayed ensconced in my poetry and prose.Between all of us, we had an intently remembered past. In overcoming it, I was sitting here drinking cups of coffee, and regarding the filaments of bulbs and the leaves of the tree with the same curiosity I had when I had first learned to forget things. Yet every night, when I was in bed, I returned to Prufrock. I watched the men and women talk of things in the caf, and the politeness of the society and I only remembered Prufrock and his dilemmas, and his bald patch, and the mermaids, and the marmalade, and the tea.I continued wearing my blacks and greys and reconstructing a winter I had lived long ago in another city where the snow fell and mornings were white when you looked out of the glass window. The dew drops on the glass would freeze and during the day, they would melt and slide down. But in the mornings, they were perched there.I was a mere observer. The other two spoke of their dilemmas. They had been set free. Or they had chosen to be free, and yet the freedom was scary. They werent used to it. They were used to returning home to someone, and now that person was gone, and they had divided the kettles, and the curtains, and the furniture. When love ends, it is not so much about existentialism and philosophy. It is also about kettles, and couches, and this and that. And those conversations made me laugh, and yet, when I returned home, I felt sad it had come to this, and winters shouldnt be the time for such things because it is cold, and the warmth is always a good thing. But then, this winter was kind. It kept you outdoors, and away from the sight of half-finished things, or incomplete sets of utensils and furniture.The two women looked beautiful on that terrace when they lit the candles. One of them had said women in grief look beautiful, and they did.They had stories. They laughed over the ridiculousness of things, and some nights, they cried. In either case, we chose to step outside. And we returned to the same caf on most nights. As we did on Sunday night.We had decided to stick to certain things. They left before I did.That night, as I ordered the last cup of coffee, I remembered an old Bob Dylan song.It goes like thisOne more cup of coffee for the roadOne more cup of coffee fore I goTo the valley belowAnd we walked out, we saw the red heart-shaped balloons again, and wished each other love, and hoped wed remember the stories until eternity. I sent them both the song that I played again. Tiny Dancer by Elton John for the road after midnight with the hope that wed never love less, and wed forever remember more and more."

Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that ethanol, which has 60% of the calorific value of petrol, was competitive at a crude oil price of $70/barrel. So, mixing ethanol with petrol made eminent sense at the time. But does this make sense today, when oil is barely $26/barrel?India produces ethanol from molasses, a byproduct of sugar. The sugar industry is riddled with controls, including controls on the production and price of molasses. Ethanol distilled from molasses is used by two major industries, liquor and alcohol-based chemicals. Chemicals yield the maximum value addition, while liquor yields huge tax revenue. Burning ethanol as fuel has neither of these advantages.The government in 2001 mandated, as an import-substitution effort, that all petrol should contain 5% ethanol in selected states. The price of oil soared after 2004, but the government funked raising petrol prices commensurately for fear of a public backlash, and so oil marketing companies suffered huge losses on petrol. It was irrational to subsidize an expensive imported item this way, but was politically convenient. So, the 5% ethanol mandate was extended to all states in 2006, partly to reduce losses on petrol sales.But implementation proved impossible. State governments levied several taxes and controls on the production, price and movement of molasses. Sugar mills complained that tendering processes were full of glitches, and that the ethanol price proposed was unviable. Little ethanol was procured: the average ethanol content of petrol was below 2%, and in some states it was zero.The new BJP government in 2014 had to tackle huge sugar industry losses, flowing from ridiculously high cane prices arbitrarily fixed by states. The mills were forced to keep crushing cane by the state governments, but lacked cash to pay farmers, so thousands of crores of cane arrears piled up. The BJP came out with a rescue package for the industry. This included a price rise for ethanol for blending to a remunerative Rs 48.50/litre. The sugar industry was allowed to change its product mix to produce more molasses and less sugar, improving profitability. The increased molasses production was supposed to spur an increase in the alcohol content of petrol to 10% in the short run, and 20% in the long run.Some greens favour biofuels to reduce carbon emissions. But Indian ethanol policy has actually been driven by non-green considerations like saving foreign exchange, subsidizing petrol, reducing oil company and sugar mill losses, and paying cane arrears of farmers.Today, the wholesale price of untaxed petrol in the US is just 97 cents per US gallon. This translates into just Rs 19/litre, against the Rs 48.50/litre being offered for ethanol. Given the lower calorific value of ethanol, India is using ethanol worth Rs 73 to replace Rs 19 worth of petrol! That is crazy. If we take taxes on ethanol into account, the differential falls, but is still huge. In the US, ethanol costs twice as much per BTU as petrol.Ethanol is not a fundamentally cleaner fuel. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, when cars shifted from ethanol to petrol, emissions of ozone  a smog creator  fell from 68 to 53 micrograms/cu.m. However, emissions of NOX (another smog creator) increased. On balance, there was no clear evidence that ethanol was cleaner or reduced urban pollution.Producing ethanol is an energy-intensive industrial process. A Cornell University study suggests that it takes 129,000 BTU of energy to produce one US gallon of ethanol, which has an energy value of only 76,000 BTU. Besides, using scarce land to grow biofuels creates a shortage of other crops, raising food prices. For these reasons, some green groups have now turned against ethanol.Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan says the ethanol policy must be based on long-term prospects, not the current low price of petrol. Very true. But if ethanol today costs two to four times as much per BTU as global petrol, even the long run case for blending is dubious. Besides, ethanol is a very inefficient form of renewable energy. Only 7% of sunlight is converted by photosynthesis into cane, barely one-tenth of cane is converted to sugar, and a fraction of that into ethanol. By contrast, putting up solar farms instead of cane farms will convert 15-20% of sunlight into electrical energy. Sugarcane is a terrible crop from a green viewpoint: it guzzles scarce water, and requires large amounts of fertilizers and pesticides. Solar panels have no such drawbacks.In sum, solar panels and electric vehicles will harness the sun infinitely better than biofuels. That, Mr Pradhan, is the correct long-term energy path for India, not a 10% or 20% ethanol mandate."

For one thing i forgot not to eat sugar around the time of my 5th Old Monk, and now at 2pm, hungover and in sugar shock, there is no way i can practice yoga.Well, resolutions are stupid anyway, especially if you are stupid enough to think that starting them out on the first day of the year will somehow give you more power to stick with it. And with that i just broke resolution #3, which was to have a more positive outlook on life. Of course all of this self-flagellation could have been avoided if i had stayed home, sober and aware. But that is for mature people who know better, people like me on the other hand are ride-or-die NYE revellers. We believe the night demands notice.It all goes back to our youth. I still remember a time when the anticipation of NYE began several weeks before Christmas and sent shivers of excitement down my spine. Part of the reason it was such a big deal was because when i was 16 NYE was the only night my parents made an exception with my deadline and allowed me to stay out late. The idea that i was awake at 3am was enough to drive me completely mad with joy and convince me i was having an amazing time.Then i turned 21 and could go out and come home whenever i pleased. That was the year NYE died. I remember waiting anxiously for the buzz to hit me but it didnt come. I recall how painful it was getting through that night and how forced the evening felt. Was it possible that being an adult had in fact killed it? Freedom is supposed to make you feel good but all it had done was lead me to the horrible realisation that NYE was like every other night. I was like a small child who had just found out that Santa Clause and all the associated magic of childhood was a lie.Or was it? Maybe magic is what you make. Children do it all day long, even after you, the adult, force the horrors of life upon them. They can still imagine. So this year i didnt wait for the buzz. I imagined it. With just a little help from an Old Monk i was able to will it in to existence. And my pounding headache this afternoon tells me it was all worth it."
590593a57be9e04154e002e9,Govt cannot ignore the fall in industrial investments for the fifth consecutive year,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/govt-cannot-ignore-the-fall-in-industrial-investments-for-the-fifth-consecutive-year/,2016-01-19,"The government has done well to give a big push to start ups by announcing tax breaks and easing procedural hurdles and they will hopefully give a big push to growth of new sunrise industries in the coming years. However, this focus on start ups doesnt allow policy makers to ignore that fact that the investments in mainstream industry continue to slacken despite various measures announced by the NDA government to boost the economy over the last year and a half.This story of the sagging fortunes of industry is best highlighted by the numbers on investment intentions filed by investors specifying the amount they seek to invest in the domestic economy and the number of new jobs that are likely to be created from such ventures. However, the most recent numbers currently available for the first 10 months of 2015 show that the trends continue to be negative with the proposed investment amount continuing to fall for the fifth consecutive year.In fact the investment proposals in the domestic economy peaked in 2010 when Indian industry filed proposals for investments amounting to a massive Rs 17.4 lakh crore in 2010. However, the proposed investments slowly slid to Rs 15.4 lakh crore in 2011 and then slumped sharply to just Rs 5.7 lakh crore in 2012 which is just about a third of the investments proposed in the previous year.Though the pace of deceleration seems to have been checked the absolute size of the investment proposals made continue to fall with the numbers further going down to Rs 5.30 lakh crore in 2013 and then again to Rs 4.52 lakh crore in 2014. Now the latest numbers for January to October 2015 show that the size of the investment proposals have further fallen sharply to just Rs 2.6 lakh crore. This is substantially lower than Rs 3.8 lakh crore of investments proposed in January-October 2014.A striking feature of the decelerating industrial investments is that it is extensive and is happening across a large number of states. Another thing that stands out is that three states have been surprisingly able to buck the trends and give a big boost to industrial investment proposals in their respective states. Topping the list is Gujarat, whose share of the total investment proposals in the country has shot up and even doubled from 9.8% of the total investments in 2014 to 20.5% in the first ten months of 2015 pushing up the absolute size of the investment proposals in the state from Rs 39,620 crore in 2014 to Rs 54,319 crore in the first ten months of 2015.The second major state which has made some headway on the industrial investment front is Karnataka whose share in total investment proposals also more than doubled from 5.4% in 2014 to 11.5% in the first ten months of 2015 which pushed up the absolute size of investments in the state from Rs 21,866 crore in 2014 to Rs 30,464 crore in the first ten months of 2015.The only other major gainer across almost three dozen states and union territories is West Bengal which has also made tremendous gains by raising its share of new investment proposals almost tenfold from 0.7% of the total investments in 2014 to 6.5% in the first ten months of 2015. This has pushed up the total new investment proposals in West Bengal from a meagre Rs 2,774 crore in 2014 to a more substantial Rs 17,247 crore in the first ten months of 2015.A sector wise investigation of the new investment proposals in the 38 odd industry segments show that the deceleration has been extensive and encompassed most major industries. However, six important industries have been able to evade the falling trends and register some growth in the current year. This includes industries like electrical equipment, food processing, fuels, sugar and rubber goods. Numbers for 2014 and 2015 show that the proposed investments in electrical equipment has gone up from Rs 34,873 crore to Rs 53,530 crore, in food processing from Rs 10,223 crore to Rs 15,967 crore and from Rs 1,870 crore to Rs 7,849 crore in fuels.But these are only marginal gains in an economy where the total investment proposals made each year had peaked at an astronomical Rs 17.4 lakh crore in 2010. So a substantial turn around would require that the government policies focus on the more basic issues that plague these segments especially the slump in demand in both domestic and external markets."

After alcohol, Nitish sarkar takes on the might of samosa, kachori and kaju katli",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/can-samosagiri-fatten-bihari-coffers-after-alcohol-nitish-sarkar-takes-on-the-might-of-samosa-kachori-and-kaju-katli/,2016-01-16,"Bihar is a poor state but its new government thinks the world needs convincing of this fact. So while elsewhere its limousines and Monets, crystal bathtubs and furs that are branded as luxuries, Bihar has gone and done the same to its samosa. Message: eating a samosa here is equal to living life king size.In addition to samosas and kachoris, there will also be a luxury tax on the pricier saris and mithais. As also mosquito repellents! In this vision of things, aam admi and aurat are the sturdy folk who live with all sorts of bed bugs, fleas, flies, mosquitoes; mommies putting their babies to bed with the lullaby, Itchy itchy scratchy scratchy, ooh I got one down my backy. But the deracinated uber rich, they go shoo, shoo with their shiny, fancy mosquito repellents.Nitish sarkar could be asking for the luxury tax because it is getting worried about the consequences of its sin tax. Prohibition is coming to Bihar, creating gaping holes in the state exchequers pocket that have to be patched up willy-nilly. Some have a rosier spin on the matter. If Biharis can no longer drown their sorrows in liquor, the sarkar wants to make sure they dont go do their drowning in cooking oil, sugar and triglycerides.Practitioners of jugaad have started brainstorming how to outwit the new rule of the new sarkar. Four-cornered famosas are a foolproof idea. Also, on the premise that no aloo may mean no luxury tax, theres brisk business in recipes for Irani samosas, Chinese samosas and chocolate samosas. Or try beetroot, cabbage, chokha, chicken, keema for fillings  the possibilities are endless.Nevertheless, Nitish sarkars move complicates the love lives of those Romeos whose favourite pickup line used to be, Jab tak rahega samose mein aloo, tera rahunga o meri shalu. (A second favourite is, You are the chutney to my samosa.) Instead of rote romance, they will have to script something original now. Like the Patna durbar has done.Moreover, this is just the kind of innovative idea that spreads like wildfire in India. Shiv Sena may already be planning to hit the streets demanding similarly elite status for vada pav in Mumbai. How about a luxury tax on momos in Darjeeling? Or khandvi in Gujarat, gushtaba in Kashmir? And definitely vindaloo in Goa, its to die for. Didnt they say two things are certain in life  death and taxes?On top of news of increased crime, now theres fear of licence raj running amok as Bihar stalks everyone buying samosa and kaju katli. Return of goonda raj, you say. No, only an occasion to impose a luxury tax on law and order, Nitish sarkar could well say. Mining for more ideas, it will sooner or later discover how Peter the Great taxed Russians for sporting a beard. Or how 14th century England taxed all adults simply for being alive.Biharis may well become thinner now, but its doubtful state coffers will get any fatter."

Its as though the man and woman, putative partners holding the fiction of friendship between them like a jump rope, stray from the beaten track of the tea gardens into the shadowy shola forest and suddenly realise that they no longer hear the Whistling Thrush. Has the bird simply nodded off, is it signalling some lurking danger or is it just waiting for a new and more beautiful song than its own to take wing?For a novel that apparently dwells on the peeling away of our social selves in search of an authentic core, however needy or illicit that might be, there is surprisingly little messiness in the plot or among the characters. Its too pat  or profound, if you are willing to sufficiently ponder on a bird that has flown its coop.It takes a rare kind of writer to attempt a parable, to proffer pared prose accorded the attention of poetry, when these days most novels, especially prize winning ones, are bulked up with such cumbersome baggage. Nairs novel is as subversive as it is slender, linking food and love and leavened by language, where an older woman who knows only too well that the stomach is the way to the heart has to remind a younger one that hearts are meant to be broken.Lena Abraham, born into privilege, London-educated and worldly-wise from all her youthful follies, fears excess emotion. The placid rhythms of estate life high in the hills and a loveless if comfortable marriage suit her perfectly, till a strangers arrival  a famous movie star at that, running away from himself  makes it dawn on her that emotional sterility is a luxury she cant afford.The novels form is equally beguiling though occasionally one suspects that the literary conceit tends to overwhelm the story. I dont think so, Nair says in reply to an email query. The book is an ode to food and love. And how these two needs or appetites can never be truly satiated. Hence the literary conceit of using ingredients to learn the English alphabet was an architectural device to build the novel on. From arisi appalam to yera, from almond to colocasia, an A to Z of commonplace and exotic south Indian recipes that offer everything  from solace to aphrodisiac  segue effortlessly into two love stories, one unfolding in the present, the other a no less gripping backstory.Meanwhile, as the casual encounter between Lena and the actor threatens to upend everything that she has carefully constructed so far, including how she sees herself, Lena keeps muttering, I am a wife, I have a life, a kind of mantra to maintain sanity. Except that circumstances are conspiring against her. Lenas husband is a kind man but staid and, like Lena, just as afraid to fall in love but for different reasons. They are a husband and wife whose very inseparability results in a kind of emotional abortion.Her lover however suffers from no such reticence and, as Lena to her relief quickly discovers, coming from a consummate actor it is no pretence. She works her own charm and in no time the heartthrob of south Indian cinema comes down from the dizzy heights of Don Juanish self-obsession to the sea level of mutual feelings. Nair evokes the sublime with enviable economy. A smile begins on his face and ends on hers. Elsewhere: She tastes the cumin in his mouth, he tastes the sugar in hers.Not only does Nair, endearingly, seem reluctant to exercise a writers omniscience, she also divines that many wonderful and precious things are best left hidden or unsaid since they risk being defiled by the vulgar gaze of the world. Maybe thats what prompted the choice of Valparai as the hill town setting. Its very remoteness helped me give it the dreamscape I was seeking, she says. Not just dreams but also to suggest the way of all flesh. As far as I know there is no English cemetery in Valparai but I felt I needed the cemetery to suggest mortality that makes the here and now so precious. Love, as always, shadowed by loss."

(Express photo) Vasai Fort was originally built by the Portuguese in 1536. (Express photo)Holding a faint smell of sea in the air, the coastal ruins of the crumbling Bassein Fort, popularly known as Vasai Fort, amidst tall coconut trees may today feel like a trip to a pirates cove. But you will be disappointed if you expect to find forgotten treasures or hideouts of buccaneers. For the rotting moss-covered walls of the fort hold not only some long-forgotten stories of war and victory but also of neglect.Around 70 kilometres away from the city, tucked in the suburbs of Vasai, lies this city of ruins. Visuals from films like Josh and Khamoshi play in your mind as you walk past the site. More recently, British band Coldplay visited the fort to shoot its song  Hymn for the weekend.In its existence of over four centuries, Vasai Fort, as it is better known as today, had seen several rulers. Originally built by the Portuguese in 1536, the 110-acre fort was captured by the Marathas in 1739 and eventually by the British after the First Anglo-Maratha War in 1802.The fort is the standing testimony of Indias diverse history. Before the entry of the foreign powers, Vasai was controlled by Bongle Raja in 1414 who built Nageshwara Temple at the fort premises. Then, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat took over and left his mark in the form of Islamic carvings on the fort walls. While fortifying the area, the Portuguese too had built seven churches within the area.Finally, when the Marathas took control, they took away the church bells as victory symbols and placed them in temples across Maharashtra.Father Francis Correa from Giriz Church in Vasai who had researched about the lost bells for over 26 years found them in temples in different parts of the state. During Chimaji Appa (Maratha Peshwa Bajiraos brother)s conquest of the fort from 1737 to 1739, he awarded the church bells to the military champions as war trophies, who in turn gave them away to temples of their choice. We found 38 church bells in places like Nashik, Jalna and Kolhapur, he said.During their two-century rule over Bassein, the Portuguese had made the fort a self-contained city with colleges, chapels, churches, restaurants, library, hospital, granary, town hall and an international market, where it is believed slaves were sold. The fort precincts also had a coin mint, an orphanage, separate bathing areas for men and women, a court and a prison.The British, however, commercialised the fort and installed a sugar factory in the precinct. But when the factory failed to yield desired profits they started neglecting the area.In 1990, after the Colonial rule had ended, the locals installed a statue of Chimaji Appa at the entrance of the fort to mark Marathas victory in the area.Not many people know the rich history of this ancient fort. Hence, a few have taken up the initiative of raising awareness about the place by conducting walks and drives for tourists. Pascal Lopes, a native of Vasai, is one such person. Lopes has done his masters in Numistatics and Archaeology and had been organising free get-to-know walks in the ruins during weekends.With greater accessibility over the years, Lopes has seen a growing interest among the people to know more about the fort. People from all age groups have begun to join him. While the fort does not see tourists every day, during weekends many groups queue in to explore the area. The fort is also frequented by young couples posing for their pre-wedding shoots, lovers looking for cosy nooks. Many naturalists have also developed a liking for this site to spend some quiet time with the sea or just watch the birds.However, the night brings a different set of visitors to the fort  drunkards, prostitutes and black magic practitioners.For the last five years, the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) has also been bringing the fort to life once a year with its Vasai Vijay Utsav on May 13  a celebration of Chimaji Appas victory over Vasai Fort.But the lack of conservation activities is slowly killing the site. Lopes says that the fort had faced maximum deterioration after it came under the jurisdiction of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 1904. After ASI took over, the fort was left abandoned for many years. During this time many people plundered the fort for its stones and other treasures. It was also affected by natural causes like lightning and thunder. The many wars also left the fort weakened.The foundation of the Chimaji Appa statue has already weakened and locals warn that it may fall anytime now.A visitor of the fort for over two decades now, Lopes feels that a lot is lacking from ASIs side to conserve the fort. While they are working on the fort, they tend to do more of renovation than conservation. The fort should be made more tourist-friendly and tickets must be applied for visitation. The money could be used to conserve the fort better, said Lopes, adding, If things go on like this, in ten years the fort will be entirely in ruins.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Cuban President Raul Castro has announced the death of his brother Fidel Castro at age 90 on Cuban state media on Friday, Nov. 25, 2016. (AP Photo, File)Fidel Castros rule of nearly five decades split many a Cuban family between exile and solidarity with the communist revolution- including his own. While brother Raul was his closest confidant and successor as president, sister Juana, exiled in south Florida, called Fidel a monster to whom she hadnt spoken in more than four decades. Eldest son Fidelito, long Castros only officially recognized child, was a nuclear scientist in Cuba. Eldest daughter Alina Fernandez, born from an affair with a married socialite who remained on the island decades later, blasted dad on exile radio from Miami.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe sprawling Castro clan, made larger by Fidels early extramarital affairs, also suffered from the same sorts of dysfunction and disagreements afflicting so many other families: siblings who dont speak, adults resentful over childhood slights and murky talk of babies born out of wedlock. During Castros long illness, the tightly wrapped secrecy about his family started unraveling as his youngest sons and their mother, Dalia Soto del Valle, rallied around him.Soto del Valle, a blonde, green-eyed former schoolteacher Castro met during Cubas literacy campaigns in the 1960s, was his lifes most enduring relationship. She was rarely seen in public and never alongside the maximum leader while he was in power.Together more than four decades, the couple had five sons, now middle-aged. Castro, who took the nom de guerre Alejandro during the revolution, continued his homage to Alexander the Great when naming them: Alexis, Alejandro, Angelito, Alexander and Antonio.None were involved in politics. The best known is Antonio, or Tony. An orthopedic surgeon and former official doctor for the islands national baseball team, he later became vice president of both the Cuban Baseball Federation and the Swiss-based International Baseball Federation. For decades their identities and their mothers were state secrets known only to a small circle of loyalists.So private was Castro about his family life, his marital status with Soto del Valle was unknown in a country where common-law unions are as ubiquitous as legal ones. Some reports said they married in a quiet civil ceremony in 1980.News correspondents on the island had heard whispers about la mujer del comandante _ the comandantes woman _ but didnt get their first glimpse of her until early 2000 when she joined a huge rally calling for the return of Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy rescued from an inner tube off South Florida. Soto del Valle also made a rare public appearance the following year at the Tropicana nightclub during Cubas annual international cigar festival.But she wasnt seen publicly alongside Castro until the summer of 2010, when he made a series of appearances after a four-year absence, including his first address to the National Assembly since falling ill.There were also dividing lines in the family tracing back to a custody battle over Fidelito even before Castro toppled Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Those divisions would only grow deeper and more bitter after the revolution, similar to the splintering in untold Cuban families with members on both sides of the Florida Straits.Fidels first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart, divorced him in the mid-1950s and took Fidelito, born in 1949 as the oldest of at least nine children Castro fathered, to the United States. Castro wanted the 5-year-old kept from Mirtas family, which included her brother Rafael Diaz-Balart, an official in Batistas government. Two of Castros nephews, Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, later became Florida congressmen who personified exile opposition to his regime.I refuse even to think that my son may sleep a single night under the same roof sheltering my most repulsive enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those miserable Judases, Castro wrote his half-sister, Lidia, in 1956.While in Mexico preparing for the guerrilla war, Castro persuaded Mirta to send Fidelito for a two-week visit, then refused to send him back. Later, as Castros sisters were taking the boy for a stroll in Mexico Citys Chapultepec Park, three armed men jumped from a car and grabbed him to return him to his mother.Even Castros own childhood in eastern Cuban had its family complications.Patriarch Angel Castro, who immigrated from Spains Galicia region and established a farmstead in a place called Biran, was still married to his first wife when he started a family with Fidels mother, Lina Ruz, the family maid.Its unclear what happened to Maria Argota, Angel Castros first wife, who bore him Lidia and Pedro Emilio. But Angel and Lina ultimately had seven children together, finally marrying in a church after Fidel, their third child, was born.Fidels older brother Ramon, a lifelong rancher, was occasionally seen in public, and sisters Angela and Emma also remained in Cuba. The youngest sister, Agustina, lived in Mexico many years.Among his own offspring, Fidel only publicly recognized Fidelito, the angel-faced, blond boy from revolution-era photographs who today causes double-takes because he so resembles his father. As an adult he rose to the top post at Cubas Atomic Energy Commission before his father removed him for unpublicized reasons in the early 1990s.Alina Fernandez was born March 3, 1953, from Castros love affair with Natalia Revuelta, a dark-haired, green-eyed beauty and cardiologists wife who became enamored of Castro during his revolutionary struggle.Fernandez left Cuba in 1993 wearing a wig and carrying a fake Spanish passport, later describing her feelings of abandonment in a book, Castros Daughter _ An Exiles Memoir of Cuba.I wanted him to find a solution to all the shortages: of clothes, of meat, wrote Fernandez, who was hired by CNN to provide commentary after her father fell ill in mid-2006.I also wanted to ask him to give our Christmas back, she added, referring to her fathers abolition of the holiday so workers could participate in the then-critical sugar harvest.Fernandezs book created a rift even among Castro relatives in exile: Juana filed suit in Spain in 1998 arguing the book defamed her and Fidels parents. A court ordered the publisher to pay Juana Castro $45,000.Castro fathered at least two more children out of wedlock: Jorge Angel Castro, who remained in Cuba and fathered at least four children of his own, including triplets; and Francisca Pupo, who migrated to the United States with her husband in 1999.Juana Castro has told of meeting Pupo after the younger woman emigrated to the United States with her husband in 1999.Meanwhile Rauls daughter, Mariela, married an Italian businessman and became something of a family rebel by heading Cubas National Center for Sex Education and speaking out for gay rights, though her activism was later very much within the political mainstream as Cuba became more tolerant of homosexuality.Despite their differences, the Castros still living on the island were said to regularly attend weekend gatherings with outdoor meals and horseback riding hosted by Raul in his role as lead organizer of family events.And as in many families, even the most disaffected set aside resentments during crises. Juana Castro refused to celebrate with other exiles when her brother Fidel had emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006.In the same way that people are demonstrating and celebrating, Im showing sadness, she told The Associated Press then.

5909e1a17be9e033b96e928d,Cuba’s Fidel Castro made revolutionary mark on history,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/cubas-fidel-castro-made-revolutionary-mark-on-history-4396115/,2016-11-26,"In this April 14, 1966 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro stands on a sugar cane plantation in Cuba.(Roberto Salas/Prensa Latina via AP Images, File) In this April 14, 1966 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro stands on a sugar cane plantation in Cuba.(Roberto Salas/Prensa Latina via AP Images, File)The son of a wealthy landowner, Fidel Castro turned his back on a life of privilege to lead a left-wing revolution in Cuba that endured for decades and was shaped by his political cunning, keen sense of destiny and boundless ego. Castro, who has died at the age of 90, was at once idealistic and pragmatic, sharply intelligent and reckless, charismatic and intolerant.Critics saw in him a stubborn bully who violated human rights, jailed his critics, banned opposition parties and wrecked Cubas economy. Admirers saw a visionary who stood up to US domination of Latin America, brought healthcare and education to the poor, and inspired socialist movements across the world.Even before leading the 1959 revolution that propelled Cuba toward communism and onto the Cold War stage, Castro saw greatness in himself. From an early age, he admired historys boldest figures, particularly Alexander the Great, and believed he and his rebels were part of that tradition. Men do not shape destiny. Destiny produces the man for the moment, he said in 1959.Castro toppled the unpopular US -backed dictator Fulgencio Batista by uniting a disparate opposition and outsmarting a bigger, better-equipped Cuban military. His alliance with the Soviet Union put him at the center of the Cold War, most notably when the 1962 Cuban missile crisis took the world to the brink of nuclear war.He was a global celebrity, his beard, military fatigues and big Cuban cigars making him instantly recognizable. He owed his prominence in part to geography. Looking to bolster an ally just 90 miles (140 km) from Florida, Moscow helped him build socialism by giving him billions of dollars worth of aid and favorable trade, from oil to tractor parts.But Castro also mined Cuban nationalism and Latin American pride, stirring resentment of US power and influence. He managed to preserve his revolution despite constant US hostility even when Cuba reeled from the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, showing the vigor of a man who intended to die in office.Instead, almost killed by a serious intestinal illness, he was forced to step aside in 2006 and he formally handed over to his younger brother, Raul Castro, in 2008.In his final years, Castro wrote opinion columns for Cubas state media but was rarely seen. His famously long speeches gave way to silence, at least in public, and comfortable track suits replaced the stiff black boots and crisp military attire.On Dec. 17, 2014, Raul Castro cut a deal to restore diplomatic ties with the United States. Six weeks later, Fidel Castro offered only lukewarm support, raising questions about whether he approved of ending hostilities with his longtime enemy.PERMANENT STRUGGLEKnown by the militaristic title of El Comandante, in some ways Castro was always replaying the exhilaration of revolt, exhorting Cubans to fight one battle after another, from confronting US hostility to boosting potato production.FILE  In this March 14, 1957 file photo, Fidel Castro, the young anti-Batista guerrilla leader, center, is seen with his brother Raul Castro, left, and Camilo Cienfuegos, right, while operating in the Mountains of Eastern Cuba.

(AP Photo/Andrew St. George, File)He survived numerous assassination attempts and outlasted nine US presidents in power, seizing control of Cuba while Dwight Eisenhower occupied the White House and stepping down during George W Bushs second term.Throughout, Castro lectured Cubans.A magnificent orator who instinctively altered his cadence to fit the moment, he re-trod history and delved deep into detail about Cuban independence heroes, plans to perfect the revolution and the declared evils of US imperialism.Tall and physically commanding, fastidious in his attire, he often built to a crescendo of indignation, gesturing firmly with long-fingered, well-manicured hands.We shall endeavor to be brief, he told the United Nations General Assembly in 1960, then set a record for UN speeches by talking for nearly 4-1/2 hours.Castro never allowed statues of him to be erected or streets to be named after him, saying he did not want a cult of personality. Nevertheless, the cult was everywhere. His image and words were posted on billboards and his name was invoked at every public event.Most Cubans, whether for or against him, refer to him simply as Fidel.He was a night owl. He would keep foreign guests waiting until late at night and then summon them for talks. Even his critics would sometimes find themselves oddly charmed by such encounters.Tad Szulc, a biographer, called him Cubas great master of political seduction.EARLY YEARSBorn on Aug. 13, 1926, Castro grew up as a privileged son on his fathers plantation in the eastern village of Biran, where his playmates were children of impoverished workers living in thatched huts with dirt floors. He said the economic injustice he witnessed there inspired a life-long sympathy for the poor.FILE  In this Oct. 12, 1979 file photo, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, points during his lengthy speech before the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, File) FILE  In this Oct. 12, 1979 file photo, Cuban President, Fidel Castro, points during his lengthy speech before the United Nations General Assembly, in New York. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler, File)He attended the Jesuit-run Belen School in the capital and then studied law at the University of Havana, plunging into the violent politics of the time and starting his drift leftward.Long-winded, intolerant and  unusually for a Cuban  awkward on the dance floor, he was not embraced by his fellow students at first but eventually emerged as a leader.He took part in an aborted 1947 plan to overthrow Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and was at a youth conference in Colombia when riots broke out and some 2,000 people died.After law school, he decided to run for Congress in 1952. When Batista staged a coup and halted the elections, Castro began plotting armed rebellion.In 1953, he led a raid on the Moncada barracks in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba. Dozens of followers died and he, Raul Castro and others were captured and imprisoned.History will absolve me, he declared at his trial.Pardoned in 1955, he went into exile in Mexico where he met Argentine revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara. Together with Raul, they trained a rebel band that in 1956 returned to Cuba aboard an overcrowded yacht called Granma.Ambushed at landing by government troops, only 12 of the 82 rebels on board made it to the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains.Castro denied Batistas claims that he was a communist but decades later he told Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet in a book 100 hours with Fidel that by 1952, I was already a convinced Marxist-Leninist.Whatever the evolution of his views on communism, he was determined to throw off American influence in Cuba. When US-supplied aircraft bombed his rebels in 1958, he vowed revenge.I have sworn that the Americans will pay very dearly for what they are doing, he said in a letter to close friend and aide Celia Sanchez. When this war has ended, a much bigger and greater war will start for me, a war I shall launch against them. I realize that this will be my true destiny.US ENEMYWashington viewed him as a potential enemy even before his rebel army forced Batista to flee Cuba on New Years Day, 1959.It took just two years for the relationship to unravel as Castro nationalized swathes of the economy and introduced a broad agrarian reform. Thousands escaped the island, starting what became a bitter bulwark of opposition in Florida.In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (AP Photo/File) In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (AP Photo/File)In April 1961, when his military crushed a CIA-backed invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs, he declared Cuba socialist and allied himself with the Soviet Union.Moscow put nuclear missiles on the island in 1962, touching off a 13-day superpower showdown known as the Cuban missile crisis.In an Oct. 26 cable to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Castro seemed convinced the Americans would invade Cuba and suggested the Soviets eliminate this danger with an act of legitimate self defense.Khrushchev felt Castro was advocating a pre-emptive nuclear strike and rejected it, telling him he was satisfied with US President John F. Kennedys pledge not to invade.The Soviets withdrew the missiles and Washington secretly agreed to remove its nuclear missiles from Turkey, ending the crisis.The United States imposed its trade embargo on Cuba in 1962 and the CIA admitted trying to kill Castro in the early years of his rule.Plots or plot ideas included trying to get Castro to smoke a poisoned cigar and taking advantage of his love of diving with an exploding seashell, or poisoning a diving suit.Castro reveled in his status as an elusive target.Im really happy to reach 80. I never expected it, not least having a neighbor  the greatest power in the world  trying to kill me every day, he said at a 2006 summit in Argentina, where crowds greeted him like a rock star.While the embargo was economically devastating, it allowed Castro to shift blame for chronic economic problems away from the system he built and onto the United States.He cast the fight as a David and Goliath story.Philip Bonsal, US ambassador to Cuba in 1959, later described Castro as a phenomenally gifted, erratic and unscrupulous autocrat who freed his country from American imperialism only to reduce it to a satellite of Moscow.REVOLUTIONIn a country that was prosperous by Latin American standards but riven by inequality and illiteracy and with an unsavory reputation as a brothel and gambling-rich playground for Americans, Castro sought to build a socialist society.His government trained thousands of doctors and provided free schooling, changes that have endured well into the 21st century, even as the states role in the economy was reduced in recent years.Those gains came at considerable cost to personal freedoms. Dissent was stifled in a one-party state with no free press, and the states long arm reached deep into Cuban lives.Throughout, Castro was a mentor to left-wing leaders and a friend to intellectuals such as Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, although others abandoned him in horror.He helped Marxist guerrillas and revolutionary governments around the world, sending troops to Angola in the 1970s to support a left-wing government over the initial objections of Moscow.Cuba helped defeat South African insurgents in Angola and win Namibias independence from South Africa in 1990, adding pressure on the apartheid regime.After Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990, he repeatedly thanked Castro. The Cuban leader was also a hero to Sandinista rebels who took power in Nicaragua in 1979.COMMUNIST OUTPOSTAfter the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1991, it seemed Castros communist rule would not survive.Cubans endured prolonged power cuts and shortages of food and basics such as soap. Ever stubborn, Castro implored them to endure the special period for the sake of the revolution.He undertook some reforms, allowing foreign investment and mass tourism from Canada and Europe, and tapping exile dollars by allowing Cubans more contact with their relatives abroad.He also let the most disgruntled leave in a chaotic exodus of makeshift boats that forced US President Bill Clinton to agree to more orderly migration.Castro was quick to see a potential ally in late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and courted him well before he won power. When Chavez took office in 1998, Castro had a new source of cheap oil, providing a huge boost to Cubas economy.Little was known about Castros personal life but even among his critics, few accused him of using power for personal gain. His tastes tended toward the ascetic.He lived in a compound in western Havana and had nine children with five women including five sons with his common-law wife Dalia Soto del Valle, who lived with Castro at the end.His eldest son Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart is a Soviet-trained nuclear scientist from the Cuban leaders only acknowledged marriage. Daughter Alina Fernandez, whose mother was a Havana socialite who Castro had an affair with while underground in the 1950s, escaped from Cuba disguised as a tourist in 1993 and is a vocal critic of her father.In one of two documentaries about him, US director Oliver Stone suggested to Castro that he was a caudillo, or Latin American strongman.Castro, who always prickled at suggestions of cruelty, rejected the term. I am a kind of spiritual leader, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

The politically influential sugar lobby in the state had been up in arms over the cap, that was introduced by the department on May 2, 2015 and had restricted the release of surplus molasses.Maharashtras sugar sector is all set to gain considerately with the state government further easing control of molasses for the production of ethanol. The excise department, led by BJPs Chandrasekhar Bavankule, has decided to withdraw the existing cap on the surplus molasses gained during the extraction of sugar from sugarcane. Molasses is the dark, sweet, and syrupy byproduct of refining sugarcane.The politically influential sugar lobby in the state had been up in arms over the cap, that was introduced by the department on May 2, 2015 and had restricted the release of surplus molasses, gained over and above the declared annual production, to five per cent.Millers had claimed that the cap was adhoc and lacked any scientific basis as the production of molasses can vary depending on the variety and the manner of sugar extraction, along with the process used for the extraction of the byproduct.Following their protest, the department has decided to withdraw the cap allowing the millers to release and sell molasses gained in surplus.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced decontrol of the byproduct on January 16 this year.Sources said the move is expected to translate into a handsome gain for the sugar mills, especially since the sale price of molasses has risen sharply  from Rs 3,000 per tonnes to Rs 7,000 per tonnes.Confirming the move, Excise Commissioner V Radha said about 1 lakh tonne of molasses was pending disposal across the state due to the cap. We have decided to release it. But the mills have been asked to submit an affidavit confirming that they are aware about facing strict action if this was found to be misused or misdirected, she said. Radha had held a meeting in this regard with the reprensentatives from the sugar industry and the states sugar commissionerate last week.Formal orders regarding the withdrawal of the cap are expected to be issued soon. Industry sources said that the move will provide sugar mills a legalised mechanism for disposal and sale of surplus molasses. Maharashtra is the countrys largest sugar producer. It has about 194 sugar mills, most of which are controlled by senior politicians. Of these, nearly 100 have also set up distilleries for production of alcohol using molasses, while a few sell the molasses to nearby distilleries.The release of the surplus old molasses is also expected to cushion the impact of an estimated shortage in its production this year. Sources said that the estimated availability of sugarcane this year stood at 445 lakh tonnes, that when crushed translates into just five million tonnes of sugar as compared to 8.5 million tonnes last season. The drop in sugar extraction will proportionately impact molasses production too, said sources. Following the rise in the molasses sale price, several sugar factories have stepped forward to report surplus gain of molasses. In fact, even three mills with linked distilleries, too, have applied for regularisation of gain in surplus, sources said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Similarly, in Maharashtra, the BJP and the Shiv Sena are in an alliance, which will be continued in the local body polls. Such meetings are not going to thwart the investigations we have launched into corruption during the Congress-NCP regime, the party member said.Senior BJP leader Madhav Bhandari said it was the NCP chief who often approached the PM.Frankly, I would describe this as one-way traffic. It is Pawar who always approaches the PM to get him on board for his functions and share the dais with him. There is nothing wrong with this officially. But dont read any politics into it, Bhandari said.Another leader described the NCPs flip-flops about its attitude to Modi as amusing.Are we not aware of Pawar play? In October, he personally met the PM in Delhi to invite him for the November function. But the impression given outside was that he had come to discuss and resolve the ongoing Maratha agitation across Maharashtra. Before that, on June 10, during the NCPs anniversary, Pawar had observed that the PMs popularity was on wane, the leader said.However, a former NCP cabinet minister close to Pawar said that Modi and the NCP chief had always shared a good rapport.Let us not forget that Modi and Pawar always shared a personal rapport. Pawar admired Modis development agenda when he was the chief minister of Gujarat. Similarly, Modi has always publicly acknowledged Pawars knowledge in field of agriculture and his commitment to farmers.The leader said that a meeting between Pawar and the PM does send across a political message. Ahead of the winter session of the Parliament, the ruling party would definitely like to have on board Pawar, who networks with smaller regional forces to form a pressure group. At a time when the Congress and parties like the Trinamool are trying to adopt an aggressive posture on demonetisation, Pawars support to the PM would definitely be welcome, he said.However, NCP senior spokesperson Nawab Malik dismissed any question of a tie-up ahead.Modi is the prime minister of the country and not any party alone. So, the meeting should be seen in the context of democratic norms, where ruling and opposition leaders can share the dais. It is not for politics. The NCP has always considered the BJP as its political rival. So, where is the question of any alliance ahead?, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

He incarnated the Cuban revolution, in both its hopes and subsequent disillusionments, Hollande said in a statement.France, which condemned human rights abuses in Cuba, had equally challenged the U.S. embargo on Cuba, and France was glad to see the two countries re-establish dialogue and open ties between themselves, added the Socialist party leader.Hollande met Fidel Castro in May, 2015 during the first ever visit by a French head of state to Cuba since the Cuban revolution.TYRANT IS GONEIn contrast, the reaction from some Cubans living in the United States was scathing and celebratory.U.S. Congress representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican from Miami, said in a statement: A tyrant is dead and a new beginning can dawn on the last remaining communist bastion of the Western Hemisphere.In Miami, in the area surrounding the Versailles Restaurant where many exiles who fled the Cuban revolution live, people took to the streets in their cars in the early hours of Saturday morning to celebrate Castros death.Hundreds of people gathered waving flags, banging pots and pans and carrying umbrellas to shield them from steady rainfall.This is the happiest day of my life, Cubans are finally free, said Orlidia Montells, an 84-year-old woman.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled, including Castros daughter Alina Fernandez Revuelta and his younger sister Juana.Still, the revolution thrilled millions in Cuba and across Latin America who saw it as an example of how the seemingly arrogant Yankees could be defied. And many on the island were happy to see the seizure of property of the landed class, the expulsion of American gangsters and the closure of their casinos.Castros speeches, lasting up to six hours, became the soundtrack of Cuban life and his 269-minute speech to the U.N. General Assembly in 1960 set the world bodys record for length that still stood more than five decades later.As Castro moved into the Soviet bloc, Washington began working to oust him, cutting US purchases of sugar, the islands economic mainstay. Castro, in turn, confiscated $1 billion in US assets.The American government imposed a trade embargo, banning virtually all US exports to the island except for food and medicine, and it severed diplomatic ties on Jan. 3, 1961.In Pictures | Fidel Castro, the Cuban revolutionary whose rallying cry became socialism or death, dies at 90On April 16 of that year, Castro declared his revolution to be socialist, and the next day, about 1,400 Cuban exiles stormed the beach at the Bay of Pigs on Cubas south coast. But the CIA-backed invasion failed.The debacle forced the US to give up on the idea of invading Cuba, but that didnt stop Washington and Castros exiled enemies from trying to do him in. By Cuban count, he was the target of more than 630 assassination plots by militant Cuban exiles or the US government.The biggest crisis of the Cold War between Washington and Moscow exploded on Oct. 22, 1962, when President John F. Kennedy announced there were Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba and imposed a naval blockade of the island. Humankind held its breath, and after a tense week of diplomacy, Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev removed them. Never had the world felt so close to nuclear war.Castro cobbled revolutionary groups together into the new Cuban Communist Party, with him as first secretary. Labor unions lost the right to strike. The Catholic Church and other religious institutions were harassed. Neighborhood revolutionary defense committees kept an eye on everyone.Castro exported revolution to Latin American countries in the 1960s, and dispatched Cuban troops to Africa to fight Western-backed regimes in the 1970s. Over the decades, he sent Cuban doctors abroad to tend to the poor, and gave sanctuary to fugitive Black Panther leaders from the USBut the collapse of the Soviet bloc ended billions in preferential trade and subsidies for Cuba, sending its economy into a tailspin. Castro briefly experimented with an opening to foreign capitalists and limited private enterprise.As the end of the Cold War eased global tensions, many Latin American and European countries re-established relations with Cuba. In January 1998, Pope John Paul II visited a nation that had been officially atheist until the early 1990s.Aided by a tourism boom, the economy slowly recovered and Castro steadily reasserted government control, stifling much of the limited free enterprise tolerated during harder times.As flamboyant as he was in public, Castro tried to lead a discreet private life. He and his first wife, Mirta Diaz Balart, had one son before divorcing in 1956. Then, for more than four decades, Castro had a relationship with Dalia Soto del Valle. They had five sons together and were said to have married quietly in 1980.By the time Castro resigned 49 years after his triumphant arrival in Havana, he was the worlds longest ruling head of government, aside from monarchs.In retirement, Castro voiced unwavering support as Raul slowly but deliberately enacted sweeping changes to the Marxist system he had built.His longevity allowed the younger brother to consolidate control, perhaps lengthening the revolution well past both mens lives. In February 2013, Raul announced that he would retire as president in 2018 and named newly minted Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel as his successor.Ill be 90 years old soon, Castro said at an April 2016 communist party congress where he made his most extensive public appearance in years. Soon Ill be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban Communists will remain as proof that on this planet, if one works with fervor and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need and that need to be fought for without ever giving up.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(Cuban Government via AP, File) Fidel Castro cuts sugar cane in an unknown location in Cuba in 1961. (Cuban Government via AP, File)Cuban leader Fidel Castro has been a revolutionary icon for many. He freed the people of Cuba from dictatorship, held on to a strong stance against and defied the United States even as he faced multiple trade embargoes and survived many assassination attempts. His rise to power was not an easy one.Born in a small town of eastern Cuba, Fidel Castro got interested in politics while studying at the University of Havana. There he joined the anti-corruption Orthodox Party and also participated in a coup that was meant to overthrow the Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo. This set the tone for his political career, launching him on the path of becoming one of the most iconic revolutionaries in modern history.Beginnings of the military careerInitially, after graduating from university, he started a law firm for poor Cubans. However, soon after Fulgencio Batista seized power through a military coup and declared himself President of a disciplined democracy which translated to his dictatorship. Batista also cancelled the state elections in which Castro was also contesting.The Cuban RevolutionFollowing Batistas rise to power and dictatorship, Castro began the revolution to overthrow the government, which was then backed by the US. In July 1953, Castro led 120 men and attacked Moncada army barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Castro had instructed them to not use any bloodshed until there was armed rebellion.Fidel Castro questions a man charged with banditry as Celia Sanchez looks on during a trial held in the guerrillas base in the Cuban mountain range of Sierra Maestra in 1958. (AP Photo) Fidel Castro questions a man charged with banditry as Celia Sanchez looks on during a trial held in the guerrillas base in the Cuban mountain range of Sierra Maestra in 1958. (AP Photo)Most of his men, however, were gunned down by machine guns. Castro was quick to order a retreat. Many others were found, tortured and executed without trial.Batista imposed the martial law and imposed strict media censorship. The rebellion failed and Castro ended up being captured. Many who were a part of the rebellion were killed. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in prison. However, Batista wanted to shed a little of his authoritarian image and released Castro on amnesty grounds. He went to Mexico where he met who would be his partner in revolution, Ernesto Che Guevara. Together, they both planned a return to Cuba.Overthrowing BatistaAs he returned to Cuba, men started organising themselves for another revolution which eventually became the Guerrilla war between 1956 and 1959 and by 1957, had started with smaller victories against Rural Guard Patrols. The Guerrilla war grew, much to the dismay of Batista who launched a full military attack from all sides in 1958. The rebels, however, held their ground, and eventually overthrew the dictatorship in 1959. Very soon after, Castro took over as Prime Minister and served as such until 1976.Che and Castro, the friendshipCastro met Che Guevara in Mexico and joined Castros movement. He worked his way up and became popular among the rebellions, rising to be the second in command after Castro. Both of them were the front runners of the revolution in Cuba. They were the closest of friends. After Castro took over political power, Guevara was involved in land reform and literacy programs.Ernesto Che Guevara, center, Cubas leader Fidel Castro, left, and Cubas President Osvaldo Dorticos, right, attend a reception in an unknown location in Cuba in 1960.

(AP Photo)In April 1965, he resigned from all his governmental posts and left for Bolivia to stir revolution there  reportedly on instructions from Castro himself. In his letter to Castro, he said he was proud of him and was leaving for more revolutions with the ideologies that he learned from Castro. I carry to new battlefronts the faith that you taught me, the revolutionary spirit of my people, the feeling of fulfilling the most sacred of duties: to fight against imperialism wherever it may be, he wrote.A failed revolution first in Kinshasa and then in Bolivia ended up with him getting captured by CIA-back Bolivian officials who eventually executed him.Later reports say that a much older Castro talked about Che as if he were still alive. Che Guevaras son told Mail Online in a 2014 report, Sometimes when I speak to him about my dad, I have a smile on my face because Fidel doesnt realise hes talking about my father in the present tense. I pointed this out to him once and Fidels response was: But your fathers here, right now.Cuban leaders walk arm-in-arm at the head of the funeral procession for the victims of the La Coubre explosion, blamed by the Cuban government on a US bomb attack on the Cuban ship La Coubre in the harbor of Havana, Cuba in 1960.

(Source: AP Photo/File)In the shadow of east Beijings soaring glass skyscrapers, elderly retirees still speak nostalgically about their Cuban brothers-in-arm, faraway comrades bound by communist solidarity. But in central Beijings halls of power, Cuba is perhaps seen these days as something less romantic: a market for Chinas booming private-sector exports.Viewed from the worlds largest communist country, Fidel Castros death is a reminder of how the communist axis has changed beyond recognition since the ideologically charged era when the bearded revolutionary cut a dashing figure on the world stage alongside leaders like Mao Zedong.After establishing diplomatic relations in 1960, the countries fortunes diverged over the ensuing decades: China began adopting free-market reforms in the 1980s and morphed into an economic powerhouse  Communist mostly in name  while Castro persisted with Marxism, Cubas economy hobbling on.Watch what else is making newsToday, the two countries leaders frequently nod to their shared ideological history, but bilateral relations revolve more around jointly developed beach resorts or Chinese telecoms investments. In a September visit, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang offered to support Cubas development as a comrade and brother, while Castro congratulated China on the growth it has achieved and sought assistance in agricultural technology.At around $2.2 billion a year, trade between the two countries is dwarfed by Chinas commerce with the rest of Latin America, which totals $236 billion, according to Chinese state media. But China is Cubas top creditor and second-largest trading partner after Venezuela, and ties have deepened swiftly. In December, Air China launched a direct flight from Beijing to Havana largely to serve burgeoning Chinese tourists looking to spend holidays in the island nation.Read more | Condemn me. It is of no importance. History will absolve me: Fidel Castro in his own wordsAfter China deepened reform and opened up in early 1990s, the development of bilateral ties between China and Cuba did not focus too much on ideology, said Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Nanjing University. Economic development and cooperation, which were beneficial to economic and social development in both countries, became more important.Geopolitical tectonics have realigned in other ways since Castros prime. Cuba restored diplomatic relations with the United States last year after a half-century freeze, a rapprochement that China viewed warily. Meanwhile, Washington lifted an arms embargo against Vietnam, another erstwhile communist enemy, and has backed Hanoi in maritime disputes against neighboring China.Also read | Cubans in Miami: Revelry and reflection after Fidel Castros deathNorth Korea remains a communist holdout, but the countrys leader, Kim Jong Un, has increasingly exasperated China, which is collaborating with the United States to try to halt its erstwhile allys nuclear program. Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said the 90-year-old Castros death had been anticipated and there will be no material change in China-Cuba relations, given that he relinquished power to his brother Raul years ago.Still, Castros passing was being mourned with a deep and genuine sense of nostalgia in China, even if he feels like an icon from a bygone era. Following news of his death, Chinese state television rolled out hours of historical footage on Saturday. Voiceovers highlighted Castros cigar-chomping charisma, ideological conviction and seeming invincibility while denouncing U.S. diplomatic and intelligence activities against the Cuban leader.From Jiang Zemin to current President Xi Jinping, who frequently grasps for Marxist-Leninist symbolism and language, generations of Chinese leaders have displayed an affinity for the distant ally at a personal level. Xi made a visit to Cuba in 2014 and, as he told an audience last year, sipped a mojito at Ernest Hemingways favored bar.Castro, likewise, was always greeted warmly in Beijing, and many older Chinese remember the 1995 visit when, decked in his tell-tale green fatigues, he stepped up to Maos memorial in Tiananmen Square and snapped a military salute. Even in his later years, Castro would often meet Chinese leaders with a bear hug, eliciting surprise and delight from his hosts.In the alleyways near Beijings glittering World Trade Center complex, elderly residents on Saturday pondered the legacy of a man who loomed large in their youths. He was a good person, said a 78-year-old retired railway worker surnamed Zhang. Cuba is our friend. I still remember joining the anti-U.S. parade to support Cuba in my 20s. The sugar we had was from Cuba.Liang Yongxing, 60-year-old retired civil servant, said he was astonished by news of Castros passing, calling it a momentous occasion for the international order. Aside from North Korea, I think he was the last person who clung to pure socialism, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: AP) Ameri Kashi Kolhi shows picture of her daughter Jeevti, right, in Payro Lundh, Pakistan. (Source: AP)The mother rummages through a large metal trunk, searching for a picture of her young daughter taken away in the night to be the bride of a man who says the family owed him $1,000. Beneath the blankets, clothes and silver ornaments that she wears with her sari, Ameri Kashi Kohli finds two photos, carefully wrapped in plastic, of her smiling daughters.Watch what else is making news:Ameri tries to remember her daughter Jeevtis age; few of this countrys desperately poor have birth certificates. With a grin at a sudden recollection she says, I remember her sister, my youngest, was born when there was a big earthquake in Pakistan.That was 2005. Jeevti was 3 years old at the time, Ameri says. That means the girl was just 14 when she disappeared into the hands of the land manager her parents were beholden to. Her mother is sure that Jeevti paid the price for a never-ending debt.Ameri says she and her husband borrowed roughly $500 when they first began to work on the land, but she throws up her hands and says the debt was repaid. We started with a loan, and every time they said they were taking money for our loan, but no one gave us anything to show we paid. Instead, the debt doubled. Its a familiar story here in southern Pakistan: Small loans balloon into impossible debts, bills multiply, payments are never deducted.In this world, women like Ameri and her young daughter are treated as property: taken as payment for a debt, to settle disputes, or as revenge if a landowner wants to punish his worker. Sometimes parents, burdened by an unforgiving debt, even offer their daughters as payment.The women are like trophies to the men. They choose the prettiest and the young and pliable. Sometimes they take them as second wives to look after their homes. Sometimes they use them as prostitutes to earn money. Sometimes they take them simply because they can.Ameri says she has heard stories of other workers whose daughters disappeared, in a country that sees an estimated 1,000 girls like them taken each year. Now, even though she and her family live elsewhere after being tossed out of their home, shes afraid that her 11-year-old could be taken too. And like everything else in her life, as a Hindu in a Muslim country, as a woman who is among the poorest of the poor, she knows she will be powerless to stop it from happening.I went to the police and to the court. But no one is listening to us, Ameri says. She says the land manager made her daughter convert to Islam and took the girl as his second wife. They told us, Your daughter has committed to Islam and you cant get her back.Pakistani Hindu Jeevti sits in her husbands house in Pyaro Lundh, Pakistan (Source: AP) Pakistani Hindu Jeevti sits in her husbands house in Pyaro Lundh, Pakistan (Source: AP)Ameri works as a day laborer cutting sugar cane and feed for animals in Pakistans southern Sindh province, a region dominated by powerful landowners whose holdings stretch for hundreds of acres. Narrow dirt tracks weave through vast fields where Hindu women in colorful saris squat with small scythes to cut the crops. Theres no talking. Occasionally the women stop for a drink of water. They make less than a dollar a day.Like Ameri, theyre often indebted to the owner of the land on which they work, kept as virtual slaves until they pay back their debt, which almost never happens. More than 2 million Pakistanis live as modern slaves, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index, which ranks Pakistan in the top three offending countries that still enslave people, some as farm workers, others at brick kilns or as household staff. Sometimes the workers are beaten or chained to keep them from fleeing.They have no rights, and their women and girls are the most vulnerable, says Ghulam Hayder whose Green Rural Development Organization works to free Pakistans bonded laborers. Employers sexually assault the women and girls, marry them, force them to convert, and rarely will the police intervene, he says. He recalls a case in which a husband accused a landowner of sexually assaulting his wife. The landowner held him for three days, beat him and released him with a warning to tell no one.An estimated 1,000 young Christian and Hindu girls, most of them underage and impoverished, are taken from their homes each year, converted to Islam and married, said a report by the South Asia Partnership organization.They always take the pretty ones, Hayder says.Hamid Brohi shows a court document as he sits with his wife Jeevti in Pyaro Lundh, Pakistan. (Source: AP) Hamid Brohi shows a court document as he sits with his wife Jeevti in Pyaro Lundh, Pakistan. (Source: AP)The night Jeevti disappeared, the family had slept outside, the only way to endure the brutal summer heat. In the morning, she was gone. No one heard anything, her mother says. The family turned to activist Veero Kohli to help free the girl.Kohli, who isnt related to the family, was born a slave. She fled bondage in 1999, walking for three days to safety and seeking out the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan to help her before returning to the landowner to recover her children and free eight other families.Since then, Kohli has devoted herself to challenging Pakistans powerful landowners, liberating thousands of families from bonded labor. She has been beaten; her home has been burned down. She has been arrested on trumped-up charges. Her husband has been arrested, and three of her sons have been jailed.Kohlis defiance incenses many men in a country dominated by a centuries-old patriarchal culture: Whether victims of honor killings, forced into marriages or enslaved as a bonded laborers, a heavy burden falls on women in Pakistan.I know that they would like to kill me, but I will never stop fighting to free these people, says Kohli, a strapping woman nearly 6 feet tall. Five months ago, she went with Ameri to the Piyaro Lundh police station to find her daughter. Her mother was crying in the police station to let her see her daughter, Kohli says.They said the girl went willingly, Kohli says. I told them: Let me talk to her. Let her mother talk to her if she went freely. They refused. Instead, they called in the man who Ameri said had taken her daughter. Hamid Brohi came alone, without the girl. He said, Anyway, she is payment for 100,000 rupees ($1,000) they owe me, Kohli recalls.He said he had forgiven the familys debt and tossed them off his land, Kohli says. Now Kohli is returning to the same police station, a small, grubby concrete room with two desks jammed together and a rickety wooden cabinet piled high with files held together with string. Police officer Aqueel Ahmed thumbs through a dozen files, barely containing his anger at the activist.Finally, he pulls out an affidavit. In it, the girl, who now goes by the name Fatima, said she had converted and married Brohi of her own free will. She also said she couldnt meet her mother because now she was Muslim and her family was Hindu. Jeevti can neither read nor write; her signature on the statement she purportedly made of her own volition is a thumbprint. There was no police investigation into Ameris allegation that her daughter was kidnapped, Ahmed says, nor was there any investigation into her age in a province where the legal age for marriage is 18.There was no cause to investigate. She said she went willingly. She said there was no coercion, Ahmed says. A second police officer, Riaz Hossain, says he knows of several other Hindu girls who converted willingly, too. But Hindu activists say the girls are kept isolated until they have been forced to convert and are married  and then its almost too late to do anything. In Pakistani marriages, the husband has to give a woman the right to divorce; without that, she has no right to leave him.A law passed last month outlaws forced conversions, but human rights groups say its practically impossible to prove that a conversion is forced because the girl invariably signs a statement saying she was willing. Police and judges almost never investigate, activists say, because many believe the conversions are a good thing and they would be defying their Muslim faith by even challenging one.So many girls, immature girls below the age of 18 years, mostly have been kidnapped, says Ramesh Kumar Vankwani of the Pakistan Hindu Council. He says families are routinely threatened, and without police protection, they abandon their daughters. Ameri, the mother, says she has been threatened by both the police and the man who took her daughter. She has gone to five different courts to get her daughter back, and failed each time. But she hasnt given up hope.Pakistani activist Veero Kohli talks to The Associated Press in Hyderabad, Pakistan. (Source: AP) Pakistani activist Veero Kohli talks to The Associated Press in Hyderabad, Pakistan. (Source: AP)Police in a machine-gun-mounted jeep take Kohli, the activist, and a foreign reporter to visit the girl. Her mother doesnt come, too afraid, she says, to confront the police in person again.Brohi, a sullen-looking man with a thin mustache, greets the police with an embrace. He angrily denies he took Jeevti as payment for the familys debt, despite his earlier boast to the activist that he had done just that. Instead, he insists he had an affair with the girl and married her. Kohli and her mother say there was no opportunity for that because Jeevti was always with her, even working in the fields.Inside, Jeevti sits on a double mattress on the floor, her head wrapped in a black shawl. Brohi leaves his young wife alone but hangs outside the door, scowling at her.Jeevti wears heavy eyeshadow and exaggerated bright red lipstick, like a child who has put on her mothers makeup  or one who is attempting to look older. It is the middle of the afternoon, yet she looks like she has just stepped out of a wedding, dressed in a glittery outfit. She looks out of place in the stark room, in a dusty compound surrounded by mud walls; none of the other women here are dressed or made up like her.Although she doesnt seem afraid, her eyes dart to the door where her husband hovers. When she speaks, her words seem rehearsed and odd for a 14-year-old Pakistani.I married him because I wanted to, she says. I myself asked him that as we are lovers, we should get married. So he said, `Lets get married, and I said yes.She says she left her home freely and denies that she hasnt seen her mother since leaving. But she cant say when she saw her mother last  or even where she lives now. She says she would be happy to see her mother but is quiet when asked why her court affidavit says she refused to talk to her mother because she had converted to Islam.She says she doesnt know what is in the court documents, although each one the police showed said Jeevti had spoken the words herself. When asked about her name, she falters for a moment. She says that her Hindu name was Jeevti, smiling slightly, as if remembering her past. But now, she says, she is Fatima.Finally, it is time to leave. Police, who have remained outside, sipping tea with Brohis father and other men, escort the visitors back to the nearby village. The visitors return the next day, without police escort.Inside the compound where Jeevti was the day before, there are only women, and no one knows Fatima. They are friendly, but look confused when the girl is mentioned. The door to the room where she sat the day before is padlocked. It is as if the compound was but a stage set for the previous visit. Within seconds, the police call a Pakistani colleagues cellphone: Why did you go there? What do you want? Why did you not stop first at the police?Kohli says she will keep fighting for the girl in court but has little hope of getting her back. At her new home, her mother looks at the trunk full of memories of Jeevti.I still have the clothes she wore, her dresses, she says. I am her mother. She is my child. How can I forget her?For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express)ALTHOUGH THE proximity between NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is no secret, the former has now formally joined the ranks of those censuring the way the Modi administration has implemented demonetisation. Speaking at a party workshop here on Sunday, Pawar said lack of appropriate mechanism has caused terrible hardships to citizens, especially the disadvantaged sections. Although, he said, his party supported the demonetisation move from day one, its implementation has caused much trouble to the public. After being initially called an outstanding decision, people are now realising the negative effects of the move, he said.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe surgeon performed a good operation but failed to take good post-operative care. Hence, now many fear that the patient might die, Pawar said.A majority of the Indian population doesnt have a credit or debit card. Almost 92 per cent transactions are cash-based, so the idea of going cashless at this junction was impractical, said Pawar. The government banned co-operative banks from accepting the denotefied notes on the fifth day of demonetisation. There are about Rs 5,200 crore, in old currency notes, lying with these banks. Its unclear what will happen to this money and how will it be guarded, said Pawar.He also spoke about the praise he has invited from the Prime Minister in recent times  most recently at an event at Vasantdada Sugar Institute last month where Pawar and Modi were seen sharing the stage.Many people ask me about my close relations with PM Modi. Its not about personal relations. When I was a Union Minister, I had helped all the states without thinking about who belonged to which party. I followed the same policy with Gujarat.

His great personal power over his country for such a long period of time is virtually matchless.Back in the sixties, he became an incredibly consequential international figure for the Head of State of a small Caribbean island nation of 11 million people. Castro was best known for prevailing in trenchant defiance of the United States  surviving an astonishing reported 638 CIA-backed assassination attempts. This is what made him a beacon of resistance in Latin America and elsewhere. Under Castro, who was a great admirer of Ho Chi Minh, Cubas friendship ties with Vietnam were also forged, which was then embroiled in a harrowing war against the United States. Hugo Chavez, the socialist late President of the Venezuela, considered Fidel Castro to be his ideological godfather. That is about when Castros persona began to become larger than life, which in turn coded his long beard, smoking cigar and green fatigues into universal symbols of revolution and guerrilla-style resistance.Ernesto Che Guevara, center, Cubas leader Fidel Castro, left, and Cubas President Osvaldo Dorticos, right, attend a reception in an unknown location in Cuba in 1960.

(Source: AP Photo)He had espoused the socialist ideals of fellow rebel Ernesto Che Guevara and in many ways, came to embody the Latin American Machismo that has been the hallmark of dictators in the region. Once Castro was popular at home and eliminated threats to his rule, he aspired to be a global player in the Communist struggle. The strain on Cuban society and treasury notwithstanding, Cuban troops were sent to Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia in support of communist insurgents. At home, he first rose to power in 1959, overthrowing the oppressive, corporate-friendly, US-backed Batista regime and transformed Cuba into a communist country in the western hemisphere.In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (Source: AP Photo) In in this Feb. 6, 1959 file photo, Cubas leader Fidel Castro speaks to a crowd during his triumphant march to Havana after the fall of the Batista regime. (Source: AP Photo)Anthony DePalma masterfully describes a powerful scene right after Batista regimes defeat in the New York Times: A spotlight shone on him as he swaggered and spoke with passion until dawn. Finally white doves were released to signal Cubas new peace. When one landed on Mr. Castro, perching on a shoulder, the crowd erupted changing Fidel! Fidel!. To war weary Cubans gathered there and those watching on television, it was an electrifying signal that their young, bearded, guerrilla savior was destined to be their savior.A powerful orator with a strong understanding of the power of televised images, Castro masterfully incited the Cuban masses even through the roughest periods of isolation and deprivation. In long, marathon speeches, he laid out what he considered to be the evils of capitalism in general and of United States in particular. This, in addition to some of the reforms he brought early on upon his establishment: his greatest legacy has been implementing free healthcare and free education, which has given Cuba some of the best human development statistics in the region. His image as the guardian of Cuban dignity and sovereignty was bolstered further when he beat back the US-supported Bay of Pigs invasion by the Cuban exiles in 1961.Also read | When Fidel Castro gave a bear hug to a surprised Indira GandhiAs he aged, the one thing that did not change was Castros ability to turn opportunities to his advantage. Even as an aged autocrat, at 74, when Cubas economy was ailing under the trade embargo, he wielded it as a sign of strength, stating that Cuba is the only country that does not need to trade with the United States. Till the very end, including when President Obama made his highly publicised visit to Cuba this year  the first visit of an American President to Cuba in 88 years  Castro, by now rarely seen in public, belittled his overtures, insisting that Cuba did not need anything that the US had to offer.Read | Condemn me. It is of no importance. History will absolve me: Fidel Castro in his own wordsFor millions of Cubans and Cuban-exiles, his death will be a reason to celebrate  the beginning of a new era, a time to modernise Cuba with a renewed vigour. And for fewer, but still considerable older Cubans and the Latin American leftist leaders, Castros death is likely to ensue mourning for the passing of a nationalist leader, who, like David spat at the Yanqui Goliath.Tad Szulc, his late biographer, who wrote Fidel, A Critical Portrait, noted He will go down as an absolute dictator, but one who mattered enormously in history. People who suffered under him say hes a tyrant, and he is. But his impact on Latin America and the Cold War was huge. Hes not a guy who will be forgotten.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The Gibe III dam, which reaches 243 metres in height, is the third-largest dam in Africa and the biggest in a series built along the Omo River. When it comes fully online, the Gibe III is expected to produce 1,870 megawatts of power, enough to sell energy abroad including to neighbouring Kenya.Watch what else is making news:But environmentalists and rights groups warn the project will dramatically decrease water levels downstream all the way to Kenyas Lake Turkana, which derives 80 per cent of its resources from the river.The lives of hundreds of thousands of people who make their living in the Omo River valley and on Turkana, both UNESCO World Heritage sites, would be affected, they say. UNESCO has previously condemned the project and Human Rights Watch has accused the Ethiopian government of pushing people from the Omo Valley to free up land for state sugar cane plantations.Gibe III, located about 350 kilometres southwest of Addis Ababa, took nine years to build and cost 1.5 billion euros (USD 1.6 billion), with 60 per cent of financing coming from the Chinese export credit agency China Exim Bank. Local radio reported that Ethiopias Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and other ministers attended the inauguration, held a year after the dam began generating electricity.With no natural gas or oil reserves of its own, Ethiopia is banking on renewable energy to help foster energy independence and economic growth. Its Grand Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile, which is slated to be Africas largest-ever dam, is expected to produce 6,000 megawatts  tantamount to six nuclear reactors  when it is completed in 2017.The Blue and the White Nile rivers converge in Khartoum and from there run north into Egypt as the Nile.

(Cuban Government via AP, File) Fidel Castro cuts sugar cane in an unknown location in Cuba in 1961. (Cuban Government via AP, File)Cuba mourned revolutionary leader Fidel Castro on Sunday as the communist island prepared to say its last goodbyes to the towering giant of its modern history with mass memorials and a four-day funeral procession. After the stunned commotion surrounding Saturdays announcement that Castro had died at age 90, Sunday was set to be a day of calm preparations, with no official activities planned. Castro, whose iron-fisted rule defied the US for half a century, died late Saturday after surviving 11 US administrations and hundreds of assassination attempts. The authorities did not give a cause of death.The polarizing leader, a titan of the 20th century who beat the odds to endure well into the 21st, was to be cremated on Saturday, the first of nine days of national mourning.A series of memorials will begin on Monday, when Cubans are called to converge on Havanas iconic Revolution Square.Castros ashes will then go on a four-day procession through the country, before being buried in the southeastern city of Santiago on December 4.Santiago, Cubas second city, was the scene of Castros ill-fated first attempt at revolution in 1953  six years before he succeeded in ousting US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista.Adored by admirers as a savior of the people, reviled by enemies as a cruel tyrant, Castro ruled Cuba from 1959 until he handed power to his younger brother Raul in 2006 amid a health crisis.Even then, he continued to loom large, penning diatribes against American imperialism in the state press and wielding influence behind the scenes.Castro is so far as divisive in death as in life.The news drew strong  and polarized  reactions across the world. Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed him as the symbol of an era, and Chinas Xi Jinping said Comrade Castro will live forever.But in Miami, home to the largest community of exiles who fled Castros rule, euphoric crowds erupted into loud celebration.There were sharply different reactions in the US from outgoing President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump.Obama, who embarked on a historic rapprochement with Cuba in 2014, said the US extended a hand of friendship to the Cuban people.But Trump called Castro a brutal dictator. The future of the historic US-Cuban thaw announced in December 2014 looks uncertain under Trump.He has threatened to reverse course if Cuba does not allow greater human rights.In Havana, bustling streets emptied and parties ground to a halt as Castros admirers sank into grief.What can I say? Fidel Castro was larger than life, said a tearful Aurora Mendez, 82.She recalled a life in poverty before Castros revolution in 1959.Fidel was always first in everything, fighting for the downtrodden and the poor, she said.Fidel Castro came to power against the backdrop of the Cold War as a black-bearded, cigar-chomping 32-year-old.Adopting the slogan socialism or death, he kept the faith to the end.He endured more than 600 assassination attempts, according to aides, as well as the disastrous US-backed Bay of Pigs invasion attempt in 1961.His outrage over that botched plot contributed to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when the Soviet Union agreed to his request to send ballistic missiles to Cuba.The US discovery of the missiles pushed the world to the brink of nuclear war.The Soviet Union bankrolled Castros regime until 1989, when the Eastern Blocs collapse sent Cubas economy plunging. Still, Fidel managed to hang on.He ceded power to his brother Raul, now 85, in July 2006 to recover from intestinal surgery.The father of at least eight children, Fidel Castro was last seen in public on his 90th birthday on August 13.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

PTI PhotoFarmers dumped grain and poured milk on the strees at protest rallies in Surat and Anand on Saturday to protest the withdrawal of high denomination currency notes and restrictions imposed on district central co-operative banks (DCCBs) on exchange and deposits.In Surat, thousands of farmers under the banner of Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) gathered at Jehangirpura in the Randher area in the afternoon, and travelled nearly 10 km through the city with truck-and tractor-loads of wheat, sugarcane and other agricultural produce to the office of District Collector M S Patel at Athwalines.They handed over to the Collector a memorandum addressed to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying there was a danger of prices of essentials like vegetables and milk rising, and possible disorder that could impact the Assembly elections in 2017.At the Collectors office, the farmers dumped wheat, paddy, vegetables and milk on the road in protest.In Anand, members of the district Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), farmers and women from milk cooperatives joined a huge rally that the district Congress took out to protest the unplanned demonetisation.The protesters emptied sacks full of vegetables on the streets in a symbolic protest against the governments decision that has affected their livelihoods. The rally travelled to the District Collectors office where the protesters submitted a memorandum demanding immediate corrective action in the face of the crisis they were facing. The memorandum submitted to the Surat Collector said many villages in Gujarat did not have nationalised banks and farmers operated through DCCBs. It looks as if the government does not trust the farmers, milk producers and their unions, which is why we have been left out of the financial transaction processes, the Gujarat Khedut Samaj said in the memorandum.The Reserve Bank of India has asked DCCBs not to accept or exchange the demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Of the 370 DCCBs in the country, 18 are in Gujarat. A large majority of the rest are in Maharashtra and Kerala.The memorandum said that the monsoon crop had reached the APMCs but there was no cash for traders to buy it from the farmers, who are running out of time to prepare for the Rabi season. The restrictions on DCCBs be lifted, and the RBI should open its own counters at cooperative banks to disburse money to farmers, the GKS said.There are over 6.5 lakh account holders of Surat District Cooperative Bank, which has branches across the Surat and Tapi districts. The Surat District Co-operative Bank has over Rs 5,000 crore worth fixed deposits of farmers and co-operative societies like Sugar Co-operative Society, Cotton Co-operative Society, Paddy Co-operative Society, Service Co-operative Society, etc.The accounts of co-operative societies are linked to the Surat District Co-operative Bank. There is a daily demand of around Rs 25 crore to Rs 30 crore for co-operative societies, and against that, the RBI has in last 10 days given Rs 21 crore cash. The condition of the farmers is bad, and if the crisis is not resolved, their situation will worsen further in the coming days, GKS leader Jayesh Patel said.In Anand, Ravi Patel of the Anand District Congress said, Our protest march included women from milk cooperatives who arrived with empty milk vessels, and farmers who brought sacks of brinjal and cauliflower from their yields. They were symbolically discarded on the streets to show that the demonetisation has affected their livelihood. Farmers have been unable to sell any produce in the market, and milk cooperatives are running dry due to the lack of cashflows. The thoughtless move by the government has thrown the economy out of gear.Their memorandum stated, The situation of the common class of people is extremely precarious. The normal life has come to a standstill. The common man is depressed. It is imperative that the government must take citizen friendly steps to eliminate this economic crunch, which will snowball into a massive human revolution in the coming days.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

LHC Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza yesterday dismissed the petition seeking disqualification of Sharif and his younger brother, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, for their alleged corrupt practices in different projects and those revealed in the Panama Papers.The judge observed the petition was not maintainable before the court. Petitioner Faisal Naseer alleged corruption is rampant in all government institutions without any accountability. He said incompetent and corrupt people had been recruited in different departments even on the key posts. He said the prime minster and the chief minister of Punjab were responsible for the growth of the menace of corruption.He further alleged that Sharif and his children corruption had also been named in the Panama Papers.

In order to yield political power, parties vied to control both the DCC banks as well as the sugar mills. (EXPRESS PHOTO BY PRAVEEN KHANNA)Early adoption of bank transfers to pay farmers and a strong banking network may help the Rs 35,000-crore sugar industry in Maharashtra to insulate itself, to an extent, from the side effects of demonetisation. Sugar mills had as early as the 1970s adopted the system to pay farmers, harvesters and their own labourers via bank transfer.Watch What Else is Making NewsSanjiv Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, said the system of bank payment had started with Pravara Cooperative Sugar mill in Ahmednagar. The sugar industry in Maharashtra is almost a century old and had seen massive growth post independence, he said.Along with the sugar mills, the network of District Central Cooperative (DCC) banks had also grown. DCC banks, which were financiers to the sugar mills, also acted as bankers to the farmers and thus, payment was linked easily to the bank accounts.Every farmer had both a loan and a savings account in the local branch of the DCC bank from where they availed crop loans. Post payment of the cane price by the mills in the main branch of the DCC banks, the local branches used to remit the same to the individual farmers accounts after deducting the loan amount from it, he said.Before the advent of electronic money transfer and internet banking, the operations were done with the help of registry, duly maintained and tallied at the DCC banks.The same system now continues albeit electronically and the farmer withdraws money from his savings account. Mills also paid the cane harvesters and their own labourers through the banking system. Rough estimates say that there are 5 lakh cane farmers, 2.5 lakh harvesters and 1.5 lakh sugar mill workers in Maharashtra and payment to all of them happens through the banking channel. Mills in Maharashtra had paid more than Rs 18,000 crore as cane payment to farmers for the season 2015-16.In Maharashtra, the cooperative sugar mills and the DCC banks have been powerful centres of power and often interlinked. In order to yield political power, especially in the rural areas, parties vied to control both the DCC banks as well as the sugar mills. Control over DCC banks would have allowed easy access to working capital for the sugar mill and its control would ensure control over the purse string of farmers, which in turn ensured political survival.Traditionally, the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have controlled both the DCC banks and the sugar mills. Entry of private players had seen the continuity of the model with nationalised banks and urban cooperative banks entering the fray in providing working capital to the banks. Also, in districts where DCC banks are weak or non-functional, even cooperative mills have similar arrangements with nationalised or urban cooperative banks. It is estimated that half of the mills have working accounts with the DCC banks as of now.BB Thombare, president of the Western India Sugar Millers Association (WISMA)  the body of private millers  said the bank linkages had ensured transparency in the sector.This year also, the millers will be able to credit the farmers accounts but the problem can arise when the farmer goes to withdraw cash, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But after surviving a crippling trade embargo and dozens of assassination plots, Castro died in November at age 90. Perhaps befitting the controversial leader, his death elicited both tears and cheers across the Western Hemisphere.But Castro was just one of many noteworthy people who died in 2016.The year also saw the deaths of pop music giants: David Bowie, who broke musical boundaries through his musicianship and striking visuals, and Prince, who was considered one of the most inventive and influential musicians of modern times.Among the political figures who died in 2016 was the worlds longest reigning monarch: King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was revered in Thailand as a demigod, a father figure and an anchor of stability through decades of upheaval.Others in the world of public affairs included former United National Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, ex-senator and astronaut John Glenn, former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, former Israeli leader Shimon Peres and former U.S. first lady Nancy Reagan.In the sports arena, the year saw the passing of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, whose fast fists and outspoken personality brought him fans around the world. Other sports figures included: golfer Arnold Palmer, Gordie Mr. Hockey Howe, basketball players Dwayne Pearl Washington and Nate Thurmond, Olympians Vera Caslavska and Tommy Kono, wrestlers Harry Fujiwara and Chyna, and mixed martial arts fighter Kimbo Slice.Artists and entertainers who died in 2016 included author Harper Lee, conductor Pierre Boulez, musicians Leonard Cohen, Merle Haggard, Maurice White, Frank Sinatra Jr. and Phife Dawg, and actors Gene Wilder, Abe Vigoda, Florence Henderson, Alan Rickman, Robert Vaughn, Garry Shandling, Doris Roberts, Alan Thicke, Fyvush Finkel and Anton Yelchin.Here is a roll call of some of the people who died in 2016.

(Source: Google map) At the Collectors office, the farmers dumped wheat, paddy, vegetables and milk on the road in protest. (Source: Google map)Farmers dumped grain and poured milk on the streets in massive rallies in Surat and Anand on Saturday to protest the withdrawal of high denomination currency notes and restrictions imposed on district central co-operative banks (DCCBs) on exchange and deposits. In Surat, thousands of farmers under the banner of Gujarat Khedut Samaj (GKS) gathered at Jehangirpura in the Randher area in the afternoon, and travelled nearly 10 km through the city with truck-and tractor-loads of wheat, sugarcane and other agricultural produce to the office of District Collector M S Patel at Athwalines.They handed over to the Collector a memorandum addressed to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying there was a danger of prices of essentials like vegetables and milk rising, and possible disorder that could impact the Assembly elections in 2017.At the Collectors office, the farmers dumped wheat, paddy, vegetables and milk on the road in protest.In Anand, members of the district Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), farmers and women from milk cooperatives joined a huge rally that the district Congress took out to protest the unplanned demonetisation.The protesters emptied sacks full of vegetables on the streets in a symbolic protest against the governments decision that has affected their livelihoods. The rally travelled to the District Collectors office where the protesters submitted a memorandum demanding immediate corrective action in the face of the crisis they were facing.The memorandum submitted to the Surat Collector said many villages in Gujarat did not have nationalised banks and farmers operated through DCCBs. It looks as if the government does not trust the farmers, milk producers and their unions, which is why we have been left out of the financial transaction processes, the Gujarat Khedut Samaj said in the memorandum.The Reserve Bank of India has asked DCCBs not to accept or exchange the demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Of the 370 DCCBs in the country, 18 are in Gujarat. A large majority of the rest are in Maharashtra and Kerala.The memorandum said that the monsoon crop had reached the APMCs but there was no cash for traders to buy it from the farmer, and the farmer was running out of time to prepare for the rabi season. The restrictions on DCCBs be lifted, and the RBI should open its own counters at cooperative banks to disburse money to farmers, the GKS said.There are over 6.5 lakh account holders of Surat District Cooperative Bank, which has branches across the Surat and Tapi districts. The Surat District Co-operative Bank has over Rs 5,000 crore worth fixed deposits of farmers and co-operative societies like Sugar Co-operative Society, Cotton Co-operative Society, Paddy Co-operative Society, Service Co-operative Society, etc. The accounts of co-operative societies are linked to the Surat District Co-operative Bank. There is a daily demand of around Rs 25 crore to Rs 30 crore for co-operative societies, and against that, the RBI has in last 10 days given Rs 21 crore cash. The condition of the farmers is bad, and if the crisis is not resolved, their situation will worsen further in the coming days, GKS leader Jayesh Patel said.In Anand, Ravi Patel of the Anand District Congress said, Our protest march included women from milk cooperatives who arrived with empty milk vessels, and farmers who brought sacks of brinjal and cauliflower from their yields. They were symbolically discarded on the streets to show that the demonetisation has affected their livelihood. Farmers have been unable to sell any produce in the market, and milk cooperatives are running dry due to the lack of cashflows. The thoughtless move by the government has thrown the economy out of gear.Their memorandum stated, The situation of the common class of people is extremely precarious. The normal life has come to a standstill. The common man is depressed. It is imperative that the government must take citizen friendly steps to eliminate this economic crunch, which will snowball into a massive human revolution in the coming days.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis.Maharashtra unit of Congress on Monday condemned Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis statement at election rallies in Ratnagiri that those opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the demonetisation move were against the country.This is an unconstitutional and undemocratic remark and displays the fascist mindset of BJP.Fadnavis has lowered the dignity of the office of chief minister, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said.He said 59 people had died due to the adverse effects of demonetisation and the informal sector which constitutes 80 percent of the trade and industry had collapsed.Shouldnt the opposition parties highlight the hardship faced by the common man? Even Supreme Court and Calcutta High Court made observations about the decision and the hardship faced by people. We condemn Fadnavis remarks, Sawant said.Campaigning for BJP ahead of the municipal council polls, Fadnavis had said those opposing the PM on demonetisation were harming the country.In this battle for economic freedom, those with Modi are soldiers and the ones against the PM will be against the country, he had said.Sawant also criticised the chief minister for announcing, at a rally at Pen in Raigad district, that state planning body CIDCO will purchase the land belonging to the defunct Pen Urban Bank to give relief to its depositors.State Election Commission should take cognisance on its own of these statements (for breach of code of conduct). Is the commission working under governments pressure, he asked.The Congress leader also demanded Income Tax probe against the state Co-operation Minister and BJP leader Subhash Deshmukh and action under the Benami property act.A few days ago, Rs 92 lakh in cash were seized from a vehicle belonging to Lokmangal Bank, controlled by Deshmukh.Sawant said the bank had no link with any sugar mill, and the explanation given by it that the money was meant to be deposited in the bank for payment of wages to the sugarcane cutters was, therefore, not valid.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Seriously, we had to be stingy. Luckily, I had loose cash in my wallet and that was used for petrol. The main problem was the lack of Rs 100 notes. My son has to travel from Wanowrie to his college at Kothrud and then later to attend his classes. We gave him a couple of Rs 100 notes and most of the time, he took a bus to return home as autorickshaws were really unaffordable, with nobody accepting Rs 500!How much cash were you able to deposit and withdraw?I was able to deposit almost Rs one lakh in cash. Fortunately, I had to wait for half-an-hour at the most in two separate queues, one to deposit and the other to withdraw. The limit was Rs 4,000, and I could withdraw that amount. However the bank staff at HDFC was cooperative and the transactions were pretty smooth.How much time did you spend standing in lines?At least half-an-hour. But I tried not to overspend and managed with whatever I had at home and the money I had withdrawn. I tried standing in line at the ATMs but frankly gave up pretty soon because of the long queues. The next time, I found that most ATMs were shut.What were the difficulties you faced?We have a credit account with the local grocer and hence supplies such as bread, sugar and eggs were taken care of. My wife ordered vegetables and fruits online. However, there were no social outings and we decided not to eat out that week or order food. The other issue was the Rs 2,000 notes. There were not many takers initially and where can you really spend the money just to get change? It was only after a few days that I could get Rs 100 notes, which I got at the hospital.How much did you spend in the last week?Less than Rs 4,000.How much do you normally spend in a week?The amount varies but approximately Rs 8,000-10,000.Do you support the demonetisation move?Yes I do. Apart from the fact that it helped our children understand the value of money and learn how to live with lesser means, the move hopefully will weed out black money. However, the entire exercise could have been organised in a better way so that a person could have withdrawn enough money to last at least a month. Also, the cash replacement process at ATMs should have been faster.Are you prepared for next week?I hope so. Since the limit for withdrawal has been raised, I withdrew Rs 24,000 from the bank. While the credit amount has been building up with our local grocer, I hope we can meet those expense first and then save for traveling costs, especially for tuition classes. As of now, I think we can make it through the entire week.(As told to Anuradha Mascarenhas)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a00a27be9e033fa42ea96,"Foodgrain output may scale peak next year, agriculture growth at 5.5%",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/foodgrain-output-may-scale-peak-next-year-agri-growth-at-5-5-4438619/,2016-12-21,"Although agri-experts have raised concerns about impact of demonetisation on rabi crops and the likely effect of forecast of warm winter on wheat crop, the secretary said the government is not downgrading the target for 2016-17 crop year. Although agri-experts have raised concerns about impact of demonetisation on rabi crops and the likely effect of forecast of warm winter on wheat crop, the secretary said the government is not downgrading the target for 2016-17 crop year.The agriculture sector is all set to bounce back leaving two years of drought behind and may well pull off record foodgrain output of 270 million tonnes in 2016-17 on good rains, but farmers woes may continue due to adverse impact of notes ban and low sales realisation. The farm growth is estimated to rise at over 5 per cent this fiscal, from 1.2 per cent in the previous year, on the back of record kharif foodgrain production at 135 million tonnes (mt) and likely bumper output in the ongoing rabi season, helped by good monsoon in most parts of the country.The agriculture sector has done well during the year. We received good monsoon after facing the drought year. Kharif in general was very good and rabi sowing has been brisk. We are hopeful of bumper production this year, Agriculture Secretary Shobhana Pattanayak told PTI in an interview.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAlthough agri-experts have raised concerns about impact of demonetisation on rabi crops and the likely effect of forecast of warm winter on wheat crop, the secretary said the government is not downgrading the target for 2016-17 crop year.Our target is to achieve foodgrain production of 270 million tonnes while our last peak production was 265.04 mt in 2013-14 crop year (July-June), he said.Agriculture sector growth was lower last year because of drought. But from that level, we will move higher.On farm sector growth, NITI Aayog Member Ramesh Chand said: It will be spectacular growth after facing two drought years. We are expecting a growth of 5.5 per cent this year.The growth rate of agriculture and allied sectors will be 5.3 per cent even if wheat productivity throughout the country is lower by 3 per cent due to rise in temperature, he said.Asked about adverse impact of demonetisation on farmers, Pattanayak said there is not much impact as the credit system has been strong in rural areas and farmers have become more resilient over the years.Our farmers have witnessed very strong drought in last two years and yet they have bounced back. I dont think it has really impacted, he said.However, farmers organisations as well as former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar have expressed deep concern about impact of demonetisation, saying farmers are unable to buy quality seeds and fertilisers for their rabi crop and are also facing problems in selling crops for want of demand.Despite record kharif production this year and expected good crop in the rabi season, farmers conditions continue to be grim due to lower sales realisation, with domestic and global commodity prices staying depressed.The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has also affected the domestic demand of fruits and vegetables, forcing farmers to sell their produce at throwaway price.About farmers woes, agri-economist Ashok Gulati said: This year, production is likely to bounce back and therefore, much better than last year. However, farmers are already under debt. And prices of cotton, basmati rice and, with demonetisation, many fresh fruits and vegetables are depressed. Because of that, despite higher production levels, farmers have not gained much.2016 began on a sticky note as the countrys overall foodgrain output remained flat at 252 mt in 2015-16 crop year due to second straight year of drought.Pulse output fell to 16.5 mt resulting in high prices for most part of the year that kept the government on its toes, which took various steps to cool prices and bring relief to consumers.The measures like domestic procurement and import to boost local supplies helped ease the prices of tur and urad from about Rs 200 a kg, but chana continues to rule high.As per the official estimate, wheat output rose to 93.55 mt, from 86 mt, but FCIs procurement fell sharply and domestic prices of wheat and its products began to rise towards the end of the year. The government scrapped import duties on wheat to boost domestic supply.To provide relief to farmers hit by the cash crunch, the government has given them an additional two months to repay their crop loans due in November-December and said prompt repayment will be eligible for the extra 3 per cent interest subsidy.The government had earlier allowed farmers to buy seeds through old Rs 500 notes from central and state-owned seed companies as well as from ICAR and central varsities. It had also asked fertiliser companies to sell soil nutrient on credit basis to farmers.To check food inflation, import duties on palm oils and potatoes were reduced. Stock limit on sugar mills were also imposed to check prices although improved domestic rates helped industry clear arrears to farmers.The year also saw the successful rollout of the landmark National Food Security Act (NFSA) across the country. Programmes like new crop insurance scheme and eNAM to link all 585 mandis on an electronic trading platform were announced to augment farmers income.In this years budget, the government raised agri-credit by Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 9 lakh crore for the current fiscal and levied 0.5 per cent Krishi Kalyan cess on all taxable services to fund farm initiatives.Eminent scientist M S Swaminathan hailed the new schemes, but stressed on proper implementation. He also wanted the government to pay farmers 50 per cent more than the production cost as part of the minimum support price (MSP).Expressing concern over poor implementation of agri schemes, Gulati, the former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, said: The government should focus completely on agriculture and try to implement some of the programmes properly.The year also witnessed the government fixing the maximum retail price and royalty for cotton seeds, including Bt cotton, based on its order issued at the fag end of 2015.The move was opposed by biotechnology firms while the domestic seed manufacturers were in favour of the decision. Global biotechnology major Monsanto threatened to re-evaluate its India business. It plans to introduce new products, besides entering into the legal battle against this order.However, NCP supremo Pawar recently attacked the NDA government for taking such a move, saying Indian agriculture is being brought back to licence and control raj which is detrimental to the growth of the sector.The government of the day should not have hostility to improve systems and technologies, he said, adding that the government is overly cautious on the technology front.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

I will give you whatever you want and I later sent officers to seek list of those whose dues were pending.I later said package will be given but not to sugar mills but to farmers and their dues will be transferred to their account directly to ensure there are no middlemen, he said.Modi said that in order to remove worries of sugarcane growers, he also asked sugar mills to install machinery to produce ethanol, which could be used as an alternative to petrol and diesel.If sugar prices fall, produce ethanol. We wont let cane growers die. The sugar mills have produced 100 crore litre of ethanol that is a record for the country.

The total population of the state is 11.23 crore.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has held discussions with officials from the RBI, Union finance ministry, DCCBs, national banks and Niti Aayog on the various modules that can be explored to move to cashless transactions.While acknowledging it is a formidable task, the government has set a target to bring at least 50 per cent transactions into cashless mode. The government believes the biggest beneficiary of cashless transactions would be small and medium farmers, labourers, vegetable venders, small retailers and traders, micro and medium small-scale industries and women bachatgats.Efforts are also underway to bring the entire cooperative network in the state online. It would include DCCBs, cooperative dairies, sugar cooperatives, APMCs, etc.The process of direct subsidy transfer benefit to farmers has yielded good response.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a137b7be9e033b96eaa40,Fidel Castro is no more,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/583378/fidel-castro-no-more.html,2016-11-26,"Fidel Castro is no moreAnthony DePalma, Nov 27, 2016, The New York Times: 2:01 ISTEnd of an era: Cuban leader who defied the US was 90Fidel Castro, the fiery apostle of revolution who brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere in 1959 and then defied the US for nearly half a century, bedeviling 11 US presidents and briefly pushing the world to the brink of a nuclear war, died on Friday. He was 90.His death was announced by the Cuban state television. In declining health for several years, Castro had orchestrated what he hoped would be the continuation of his Communist revolution, stepping aside in 2006 when he was felled by a serious illness.He provisionally ceded much of his power to his younger brother Ral, now 85, and two years later formally resigned as president.Ral, who had fought alongside Castro from the earliest days of the insurrection and remained minister of defence and his brothers closest confidant, has ruled Cuba since then, though he has told the Cuban people he intends to resign in 2018.Castro had held onto power longer than any other living national leader, except Queen Elizabeth II. He became a towering international figure whose importance in the 20th century far exceeded what might have been expected from the head of state of a Caribbean island nation of 11 million people.He dominated his country with strength and symbolism from the moment he triumphantly entered Havana on January 8, 1959.He completed his overthrow of Fulgencio Batista by delivering his first major speech in the capital before tens of thousands of admirers at the vanquished dictators military headquarters.Castro wielded power like a tyrant, controlling every aspect of the islands existence. He was Cubas Mximo Lider. Countless details fell to him, from selecting the colour of uniforms Cuban soldiers wore in Angola to overseeing a program to produce a superbreed of milk cows. He personally set the goals for sugar harvests. He personally sent countless men to prison.But it was more than repression and fear that kept him and his totalitarian government in power for so long. He had both admirers and detractors in Cuba and around the world. Some saw him as a ruthless despot who trampled rights and freedoms; many others hailed him as the crowds did that first night, as a revolutionary hero for the ages.Even when he fell ill and was hospitalised with diverticulitis in summer 2006, giving up most of his powers for the first time, Castro tried to dictate the details of his own medical care and orchestrate the continuation of his Communist revolution, engaging a plan as old as the revolution itself.By handing power to his brother, Castro once more raised the ire of his enemies in Washington. The US officials condemned the transition, saying it prolonged a dictatorship and again denied the long-suffering Cuban people a chance to control their own lives.But in December 2014, President Barack Obama used his executive powers to dial down the decades of antagonism between Washington and Havana by moving to exchange prisoners and normalise diplomatic relations between the two countries, a deal worked out with the help of Pope Francis and after 18 months of secret talks between representatives of both governments.Though increasingly frail and rarely seen in public, Castro even then made clear his enduring mistrust of the US. A few days after Obamas highly publicised visit to Cuba in 2016 -- the first by a sitting US president in 88 years  Castro penned a cranky response denigrating Obamas overtures of peace and insisting that Cuba did not need anything the US was offering. Fidel Castro, said Henry M Wriston, president of the Council on Foreign Relations in the 1950s and early 1960s, was everything a revolutionary should be.Castro was perhaps the most important leader to emerge from Latin America since the wars of independence in the early 19th century. That image made him a symbol of revolution throughout the world and an inspiration to many imitators. But beyond anything else, it was Castros obsession with the US, and Americas obsession with him, that shaped his rule.Castros defiance of the US power made him a beacon of resistance in Latin America and elsewhere, and his bushy beard, long Cuban cigar and green fatigues became universal symbols of rebellion.In April 2016, a frail Castro made what many thought would be his last public appearance, at the Seventh Congress of the Cuban Communist Party. Dressed in an incongruous blue tracksuit jacket, his hands at times quivering and his once powerful voice reduced to a tinny squawk, he expressed surprise at having survived to almost 90, and he bade farewell to the party, the political system and the revolutionary Cuba he had created.Soon I will be like everybody else, Castro said. Our turn comes to us all, but the ideas of Cuban communism will endure.No one is sure if the force of the revolution will dissipate without Castro and, eventually, his brother. But Castros impact on Latin America and the Western Hemisphere has the earmarks of lasting indefinitely.We are going to live with Fidel Castro and all he stands for while he is alive, wrote Matthews of The Times, whose own fortunes were dimmed considerably by his connection to Castro, and with his ghost when he is dead."

(File Photo)Britain will ban junk food ads aimed at children from both print and social media from next year, the advertising rules watchdog said today, a move welcomed by campaigners against child obesity. The new rules, which come into effect in July 2017, extend an existing ban on television ads for high fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) food or drink products. The new restrictions will lead to a major reduction in the number of ads for HFSS food and drinks seen by children, the Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP) said in a statement.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe body said the ban reflected changing advertising methods and media habits among children.It cited research saying that children aged between five and 15 in Britain are now spending more time online than watching television.Childrens Food Campaign co-ordinator Malcolm Clark said: CAP has finally listened to the voices of parents and health professionals, after years of resisting calls for stronger measures.But Clark and other campaigners pointed out that the ban only applies to media where children make up over 25 percent of the audience, opening up a potential loophole for junk food marketing.Jenny Rosborough, campaign manager at Action on Sugar, called for restrictions on programmes such as talent shows which are popular with children but exempt because they are not childrens programming.We need to see bans on advertising go further, she said.Food And Drink Federation head Ian Wright said the change was a major shift that was fully supported by the industry.Britain is also planning a sugar tax on soft drinks to reduce rising levels of obesity, despite opposition from businesses in the sector.Britain has some of the worst obesity rates in Europe.The latest official figures for England from 2014 show that 31.2 per cent of children aged between two and 15 were either overweight or obese.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

The Sena also took a dig at NCP supremo Sharad Pawar over his remarks on financial emergency in the country, saying that he should have made the comment in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi (when they met during an event at Pune reccently).Due to the demonetisation decision, the government has been able to divert the attention of people from hunger, inflation, unemployment and terrorism. The government was successful in making people forget important national issues, said an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana.Not a single big fish has been seen standing in long queues to exchange their money. This means that the real black money has not yet come out and Modis friends (supporters of the decision) will have to accept this, the NDA partner said.Instead of putting people in jail for seven years for depositing money in others accounts, the government should award them life imprisonment, it taunted.Seizing on Pawars remarks, the Sena said It is hypocritical of Pawar to say there is financial emergency in the country, or Pawar would have made the comments in presence of Modi (in Pune). But indulging in bonhomie and then speaking against Modi outside is not good for the people.Pawar is as much responsible for the current mess as Modi had publicly said that he has learnt political acumen from the Maratha strongman, the Sena further said.Two days back, the NCP chief attacked the Modi government over demonetisation and Rs 98,000-crore bullet train project, saying The country is in the grip of an economic emergency due to Modis decision.On November 13, PM Modi had lauded Pawar for his 50 years of unbeaten innings in electoral politics.Speaking after inaugurating Sugarcane Value Chain-Vision 2025 Sugar international conference and exhibition at Punes Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI), an autonomous cane growers body headed by Pawar, Modi had lauded the developments initiated by the NCP chief and his concern for farmers and agri sector.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: AP) Italian Premier Matteo Renzi speaks during a press conference at the premiers office Chigi Palace in Rome, early Monday, Dec. 5, 2016. Renzi acknowledged defeat in a constitutional referendum and announced he will resign on Monday. (Source: AP)The euro fell to a 20-month low on Monday and investors fled riskier assets after Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign following a stinging defeat on constitutional reform that could destabilise the countrys shaky banking system. European stock markets are also set for a weak start, with Italy underperforming as investors brace for turbulence and political crisis in the euro zones heavily indebted third-largest economy.Watch What Else is Making NewsFinancial spreadbetter IG Markets expects the EuroSTOXX 50 to open down 0.6 percent, and Germanys DAX and Britains FTSE to start the day 0.4 percent lower. Renzis failure deals a body blow to a European Union already reeling under anti-establishment anger that led to the shock exit of the UK from the club in June.Its not very hard to see a new election on the horizon, and its not very hard to see the (opposition) 5-Star Movement taking power with stated aims to either leave the EU, drop the euro, or both, said Mark Wills, head of State Street Global Advisors investment solutions group for the Asia Pacific.For Italy, establishing stable governance and a plan to guide the nation is of critical importance given the fragility of the economy, challenging policies and the liquidity problems in the banking system.The single currency slumped as much as 1.4 percent to $1.0505, before recovering a bit to $1.0563.The drop to its session low was the sharpest since June and opened the way to a retest of the March 2015 trough around $1.0457.Analysts at RBCCM argued that, based on what happened in 2012 at the height of the Greek crisis, the risk of a euro zone crisis could see the euro trade as low as $0.8000.It may sound extreme, but if a second euro zone crisis were to hit, with the US dollar at a much stronger starting point, EUR/USD could arguably trade lower still, they wrote.The euro slid as much as 2.05 percent to 118.71 yen, but pared some of the losses to trade down 1.1 percent at 119.85 yen.The dollar was supported by expectations of a US rate increase this month and more to come next year. The dollar index,, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global peers, jumped 0.6 percent to 101.37.Against the yen, the US currency, which rose earlier to as high as 113.85, pulled back 0.1 percent to 113.41 yen. The New Zealand dollar, which earlier weakened almost 1 percent to $0.707 after Prime Minister John Key unexpectedly announced his resignation on Monday, recovered a little to trade at $0.7106.New Zealand stocks ended the day 0.7 percent lower. MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.6 percent, while E-mini futures for the S&P 500 narrowed losses to 0.3 percent.Japans Nikkei closed down 0.8 percent. Even as the long-awaited opening of a scheme to connect the Shenzhen and Hong Kong stock markets went live on Monday, Chinas blue-chip index slumped the most in six months after the nations top securities regulator warned against barbaric share acquisitions, although small caps remained firm.Chinas CSI 300 index tumbled 1.7 percent. Hong Kongs Hang Seng index retreated 0.7 percent.The link between Chinas booming Shenzhen stock market and neighbouring Hong Kong allows foreign investors access for the first time to some of the fastest growing technology companies in the worlds second-biggest economy.Back in Europe, dealers said Italian bonds were set to come under pressure as top-rated U.S. Treasuries and German bunds gained.US 10-year Treasury yields fell to 2.3435 percent from 2.39 percent at Fridays close. Investors and European politicians fear the No camps victory in Italy could cause political instability and renewed turmoil for the nations banking sector, which has been hit by concerns over its huge exposure to bad loans built up during years of economic downturn.Forming a stable government in Italy may be difficult, the resuscitation of (ailing lender) Monte Dei Pashci may be impacted, there is some potential that this may create an opening for a secessionist political party, said Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney.The prime ministers resignation represents a fresh blow to the European Union, which is struggling to overcome a raft of crises, and was eager for Renzi to continue his reform push.Markets had earlier taken some encouragement when Austrias far-right presidential candidate was soundly defeated by a pro-European contender, confounding forecasts of a tight election.The European Central Bank meets Thursday amid much speculation it will announce a six-month extension of its asset buying program and widen the type of bonds it can purchase.There has been some speculation that the ECB would step and front load purchases of Italian bonds if markets became unsettled by a No result, so perhaps it is the thoughts of a central bank liquidity sugar pill driving things again, said ANZ economist Jo Masters.OIL PULLS BACKIn the last trading session before the referendum, the Italian benchmark posted a 0.2 percent decline.The pan-European STOXX 50 closed down 0.4 percent.Wall Street ended Friday on a cautious note, with the Dow off 0.11 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 0.04 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.09 percent.While the US November payroll report on Friday was firm enough to cement expectations of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve this month, a surprise pullback in wages helped bonds pare a little of their recent losses.In commodity markets, oil ran into risk aversion and some profit-taking after recording its best week in at least five years following OPECs decision to cut crude output.Markets are now focused on the implementation and impact of OPECs first output cuts since 2008, to be joined by Russia and possibly other non-OPEC producers.

590a18107be9e033b96eac8a,Large-scale cross voting in Legislative Council polls,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/large-scale-cross-voting-in-legislative-council-polls-4390759/,2016-11-23,"At a time when the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is projecting Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation initiative as an effective strike to curb black money, elections to fill six Legislative Council seats threw up several combinations.Election results for the polls for the six seats  Yavatmal, Bhandara-Gondia (Vidarbha), Sangli-Satara, Pune (Western Maharashtra), Jalgaon (North Maharashtra) and Nanded-Waghala  were announced Tuesday. While the results jolted the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which failed to retain three out of four seats it had been representing, political analysts said large scale cross-voting emerged as the mainstay in these elections.Watch what else is making news:In Yavatmal, Shiv Senas Tanaji Sawant, a sugar baron from Marathwadas Osmanabad, wrested the seat defeating Congresss Shankar Bade and sitting NCP legislator Sandeep Bajoria. The margin of his victory was the telling blow. Sawant, the outsider, polled 348 votes, against Bades 78, while Bajoria polled just two votes. The BJP had supported Sawants candidature before hand. Incidentally, sensing the race had slipped away from him, NCPs Bajoria, too, had at the last moment endorsed Sawants candidature.A similar tale emerged from Bhandara-Gondia too. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnaviss handpick Parinay Fuke, a corporator in the Nagpur municipality and vice-president of BJPs Nagpur unit, won from an alien constituency, exploiting the rift between the Congress and the NCP. Senior NCP leader Praful Patels close associate and incumbent legislator Rajendra Jain had been renominated by the party, but the Congress fielded MLA Gopaldas Agarwals son Praful, making the win possible for Fuke and the BJP.In Satara-Sangli, Mohanrao Kadam, an education baron and brother of former Congress minister Patangrao Kadam, upset NCPs Shekhar Gore to wrest the seat. The Satara-Sangli seat was seen as a fortress for the NCP. Party insiders confirmed that the NCP had been divided on Gores candidature. Ajit Pawar had pushed for Gores candidature amid objections raised by local heavyweights Jayant Patil and Udayanraje Bhonsale. Talks between the Congress and the NCP for a pre-poll arrangement had broken off over the Yavatmal and Satara-Sangli seats.Though the Congress retained the Nanded-Waghala seat, independent candidate Shyamsunder Shinde, a retired bureaucrat, managed to poll votes from Shiv Sena, BJP, and NCP councillors to give party candidate Amar Rajurkar a scare. The seat is a bastion of state Congress chief and former chief minister Ashok Chavan. While Rajukar polled 251 votes, Shinde was not far behind with 208 votes. Rajurkar had been elected unopposed the last time.The BJP retained the Jalgaon seat with its candidate Chandulal Patel winning convincingly. In the run-up to elections, an internal struggle had ensued within the BJP after the incumbent legislator Gurmukh Jagwani, a close-associate of former minister Eknath Khadse, was denied a renomination at the last moment. Khadses party rival and sitting BJP minister Girish Mahajan had propped up Patel, a builder. Khadse had aired his disappointment over the partys decision, pointing out that Patel did not even have the partys primary membership. The state BJP, however, heaved a sigh of relief when the results showed that the internal struggle hadnt impacted the polls outcome. The only solace for the NCP was that the party managed to retain the Pune seat. Partys sitting legislator Anil Bhonsale won the race convincingly.No sooner had the poll results been announced, the blame game between the Congress and the NCP started. While the NCP blamed the money power and the Congress for their poor performance, the later hit back. Had the NCP not played truant and struck a pre-poll understanding with us, the outcome would have been different. Both parties would have won three seats each.The BJP and the Shiv Sena were not complaining. While the NCP is still the largest party in the Legislative Council with 23 seats in the 78-member House, the Congress now has 20 members, followed by the BJP (18) and the Shiv Sena (9).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: AP) Kundhavi Kadiresan, Assistant Director-General and FAOs Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific addresses a conference in Bangkok, Thailand. (Source: AP)Even as Asia makes clear strides in taming hunger and famine, the rapidly modernizing continent needs to focus more on diversifying its diet or risk failing to quell malnutrition, with milk having the potential to help, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said in a report Tuesday.We still have nearly half a billion hungry people in this region, said Kundhavi Kadiresan, FAOs assistant director general. This report is an eye-opener.Watch What Else Is Making NewsWith greater political stability and modern farming techniques, undernourishment rates halved in Asia from 24.3 percent to 12.3 percent in the past 25 years, satisfying one of the U.N.s Millennium Development Goals, the report said.As people move from the countryside to big cities by the millions, diets are changing from ones dominated by rice to more Westernized versions incorporating more fruits, vegetables and meats. Calories from starches declined by 50 per person a day while ones from fruits, vegetables, and meat increased by over 300 per person a day, the report said.But despite this improvement, the changing diets arent all good news. Like citizens in the West, people in Asia are exercising less and chowing down heavily processed foods filled with sugar and fat instead of traditional ones like chickpeas. This means many still arent getting enough nutrients like zinc, iron, or vitamin A. Obesity levels are skyrocketing, rising more than 4 percent a year, the report said.So as dire hunger becomes less common, balanced and diverse diets are becoming a more pressing issue. Agriculture experts acknowledge they have been obsessed with rice, wheat and maize in the fight against hunger, at the cost of overlooking whether expanding diets are also nutritious.It has filled the belly, but it is creating a lot of problems, said Kadambot Siddique, a professor at the University of Western Australia.We must make this distinction between hunger and malnutrition, said Biraj Patnaik, a food policy adviser to Indias government. He said India is in the process of eliminating hunger, but has only reduced undernutrition by 1 percent in the past decade.With persistent hunger in South Asia, only two out of 19 developing Asian countries are on track to reach the U.N.s Sustainable Development goal of zero hunger by 2030, and seven by 2040, the study said.However, changing tastes in food means Asians are drinking more milk, a cheap and nutritious way of diversifying diets. Dairy products are traditionally largely absent in Asian diets but now fly off the shelves from Bangkok to Beijing, with production almost tripling from about 110 million tons in 1990 to nearly 300 million tons in 2013. Some countries are providing cartons in classrooms, like Thailands National Milk Program.But experts say governments should avoid repeating the mistake of taking shortcuts that emphasize investment in big agribusiness over small farmers. Small producers produce nearly 80 percent of the milk in Asia, so booming milk sales benefit everyone, not just the rich, in contrast to farmland, where major landowners often win big on crop subsidies.As a result, the report says, the dairy industry is a potential engine of poverty-alleviating growth, so long as things remain egalitarian.Policy-makers need to ensure that the regions small-holder dairy farmers, the largest segment of dairy producers, can have fair access to, and compete in, the marketplace, Kadiresan said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Making the individual towers, suspension cables, and getting the Victorian Gothic style right took over 700 man hours. Sam Ramachandran, one of the cake artists, said, It took a lot of patience because everything has to be according to measurements. It is much like engineering.C Ramachandran, started the cake shows back in 1974 with a 14-foot model of the Eiffel tower. I learned the art of cake decoration in West Germany and England. I want this art to continue growing, he said. The 76-year-old has now handed over the cake show to students from the Institute of Baking and Cake Art.Sugar is seen in its best form as a Thanjavur painting of a female dancer, finely detailed with edible lace and jewellery. The creator, Purva Sadvilkar took special Thanjavur painting classes six months in advance to prepare for the final piece.Apoorva Bhargava and Khadijah Madar imagined the issue of demonetisation in icing- new Rs 500 and Rs 2000 notes blooming on a money tree atop an India-shaped mountain. Explaining the concept, Madar said, The rising sun behind the mountain shows that though people are struggling, they are hopeful about benefits of the move. The river flowing down is cleansing the system of black money.Staying true to the traditional method of cake decoration, Avril Pinto used only piping bags and nozzles to create intricate meshes and designs for her wedding cake. People prefer molds these days because they are precise but I wanted to show that it is possible to achieve perfection by hand as well, Avril said. Planning and executing the 25 kg cake took two months and the weather made matters worse. Royal icing is sensitive to moist weather. Because of the rains in the past week, the meshes became soft and dropped off. I had to redo most of it, she said.Actor Shankar Nag in icing, a two-storey dollhouse made of cookies, a Rajasthan wedding themed cake, a queen in a Victorian Gown, a book coming alive with tale of Jack and the Beanstalk are among the other attractions.The show will be open to the public from 11am to 9 pm every day till January 1, 2017."

Chris Woakes played the first Test but missed the second against India at Visakhapatnam.Chris Woakes, billed to fill in the moon boots of Stuart Broad in Mohali, has a pragmatic solution to the latest scandal in the sport. That is to ban the mint, and with it, other sugary artificial substances like energy drinks. Why dont you just stop eating mints? If thats the way the ICC want to go, maybe completely ban anything going on the pitch, he says. The tone is one of wry sarcasm than hurtless jest. Woakess exhibition of solidarity to the chewing-popping brethren in cricket, though, was cut short by the England media manager, almost imploring the floor to not veer away match-related queries.But on a serious note. Woakess lampooning does make a sense. Firstly, there is no scientific evidence or consensus as such that sugary saliva catalyses exaggerated movement. Its more of a belief among players that it does aid movement. So the consequence of sugary saliva on a cricket has to be scientifically researched before its deemed an artificial substance.If so, even Gatorade too should be banned from the ground, says Woakes: Gatorade has sugar in it as well. We take those drinks on board and then lick our tongue and put that on the ball so thats a grey area as well. Is that classed as a sugary substance going on the ball? I dont know.Even greyer, perhaps, is to judge whether a player is doing it intentionally or not. Its not an exact science. If youre exactly placing a sweet on the ball that is obviously against the rules but everything else seems to be a little bit of a grey area. Thats our stance on it and we wont be changing anything we do when we go out there this week, he says.He illustrates his point with another example. Hashim Amla said about him having chewing gum in his mouth pretty much all day. Is that deemed as wrong and as cheating? Im not sure. I think it needs to be clarified to exactly what the problem is. Theres always cameras on you, there always has been, so theres nothing we need to change he says.Even then, no matter how many ever times you watch a particular footage, its difficult to ascertain whether a player is doing this with the intention of tampering the ball. Take for example, the Du Plessis footage. Though it clearly shows him touching the gum and then applying saliva on the ball, its not fully conclusive whether he was applying it intendedly or not. Its is a mere guess, a subjective inference or at its worst a conjecture. Its something only Du Plessis can answer with any amount of genuineness. After all, he wouldnt be stupid enough to be unaware of the cameras.Hence, the way out of all this mess is, as Woakes suggests, a blanket ban on chewing altogether. Its a bit like burning the mansion to kill the rat. But it nonetheless solves the inconclusiveness pertaining to the law, though it would sure lead to mutinous reactions from this players. For players chew gums not just out of habit but also for getting that sugar-boost. Occasionally the guys at drinks breaks guys will come and have sweets or mints just to freshen up, to keep the energy going but. Its just a sugar boost really. I suppose when youre in the middle of a day theres only so much fluid you can take on board, only so many bananas you can eat so during a tough session when the opposition are 200 for 2 the odd lolly is quite nice, chuckles Woakes.His indignation, like so many other present and former players, stems not only from how the incident was blown out of proportion, but the underlying scepticism with which players are suddenly perceived on a cricket field. Or how it has triggered a spate of such-like allegations like an English newspaper accusing Virat Kohli of the same.India coach Anil Kumble too felt much the same way. South Africa has played exceptional cricket to beat Australia 2-0 and to be told that this ball tampering or whatever, I think it is very silly. Its making a mountain out of a molehill, he sniggers.Woakes, then, signs off from the topic with a sense of defiance. We do what we do and we havent been told off for it as such or banned or fined so well continue to do exactly what weve done in the past.Its not the only grey area in cricketing laws. In his column for the Times, former England skipper Michael Atherton brings up a similar instance of vagueness in cricketing laws. In Englands first Test in Chittagong, players were encouraged to aim at the stumps, even when the prospects of a run out were inexistent.The idea was to land the abrade side of the ball on the bare, dry square near the keeper, so that it would get rougher faster than it generally takes. The code of conduct that governs international cricket says that deliberately throwing the ball into the ground for the purpose of roughing it up shall not be permitted. How do you decide as an umpire what is deliberate and what is not? A shy at the stumps can be legitimate or unnecessary; a ball that lands a yard short of the wicketkeeper can be a deliberate ploy or an incompetent throw, he argues.Not just England, most sides in the subcontinent do it to hasten reverse swing. Most sides go scot-free too. But somewhere in the future, complaints and accusations will be made too. Bans and fines will fly thick and fast. The ambiguity of the games laws, codified ages ago, will again be ravenously discussed.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: AP) Facing ICCs ball tampering charges, Faf du Plessis has got support from peers, who have said that everyone does it. (Source: AP)Around a decade ago, the fast bowling community in India was on a covert mission to find out which sweet candy suited them the most. You cant be a big snarly fast bowler and be seen with a toffee. But they had their reasons.They sought a sugary sweet that would generate the thickest paste on their tongues and subsequently help them in maintaining or altering the condition of the ball according to their requirements, illegally. Eventually it was Alpenliebe that ended up as the winner with Poppins remember them  finishing a close second.The amazing mix of caramel, milk and butter  as described by its tagline  present in Alpenliebe when blended with the bowlers saliva would then aid the pacers in maintaining the shine on the ball for a lot longer once he got down to applying the paste on it. And its thickness would also make the shiny side heavier also helping him in his quest for reverse swing. It was their eureka moment. Energy ka energy, sugar ka sugar, aur ball bhi ban gaya, says a player who was part of the search team.The ingenious tampering technique like the game itself has its origins in England. Marcus Trescothick, the former England captain, had candidly revealed in his book Coming Back To Me in 2008 about having consumed copious amounts  close to 15 a day  of Murray Mints, a popular candy in the UK, while being the official ball-shiner of the team during their famous Ashes victory in 2005. Murray Mints of course were Trescothicks choice of confection. The original discovery had been made by former England all-rounder Dermot Reeve, who identified his county teammate Asif Dins penchant to chew strong mints as being the reason why Warwickshire swung the ball for longer than any other team. And this addiction for Murray Mints is among the first oddities you experience as an overseas player in the County dressing-rooms to the extent as one cricketer from Asia says, I would see boxes of them in there. I first wondered how an entire team can suffer from bad breath.Ironically though, it was a similar slurp-up that South African captain Faf du Plessis was accused of in Hobart two weeks ago, with camera evidence of him shining the ball with a candy in his mouth. There was also another video that emerged last week showing Indias Test captain Virat Kohli seemingly indulging in the same act. Though both skippers dismissed the allegations, du Plessis was found guilty and slapped with a 100 per cent match-fee fine while the ICC found nothing wrong in what Kohli had done.Code of silenceIf you ever wanted proof that cricket has lived out of a candy store for decades, even if not openly, you just had to see the outpouring of support for du Plessis from peers and former cricketers, even some from Australia  the team that hed technically cheated by altering the condition of the ball illegally  taking the everyone does it stand.The last week or so also showed up quite embarrassingly that the issue of ball tampering still remains a grey area for the ICC. That ambiguity also stems from the fact that the governing body has forever been a step behind when it comes to curbing it. For some, however, ball tampering has always been stuck somewhere between blatant cheating and gamesmanship. Law 42.3 still remains as vague as ever.But try speaking to any fast bowler about the business of making a ball  the word tampering is pretty much a conversation ender with them  and they literally stop short of quoting the Omerta code, like its some occult practice only fit for ears of fellow practitioners. What they do reveal are tell-tale signs. Like the next time you see the ball get tossed around to more players than usual before reaching the bowlers hands, be rest assured theres something in the air.Its a practice we followed as a team, especially if it wasnt doing anything. While shining the ball you have all five fingers on the seam. So all youre required to do is just scratch the ball lightly with two finger-nails every time you shine the ball. Now if four players are using two finger nails after each delivery, imagine the state of the ball at the end of the over, says a former international cricketer.Ive played with a few in domestic cricket who could literally chew up one side of the ball within two overs. And Im not talking about the way Afridi did it literally, he adds of the apple-bite episode.This is not quite breaking the magicians code. But its probably the closest youll get to it. Unlike the candy which is used to keep the sheen on one side for longer, the sharper objects like finger-nails are used to keep the other side rougher. For as we know, reverse swing depends on the shiny side being heavier so that the ball swings in that direction unnaturally while its smoothness allows the air to pass quicker on that side while producing friction on the rougher side.Now using your finger-nails doesnt mean gouging the ball and making it look like its been in a washing-machine. Theres a lot of skill involved here too, especially these days with umpires constantly checking the ball and also repossessing it after every over, wicket and during a break. Whatever you do, the scuffing up of the ball has to look natural.I played with a former Pakistani cricketer, who insisted on being positioned at mid-on, in a T20 tournament and suddenly the white ball started swinging like crazy towards the end. After the innings he showed me the ball, and hed done it so artfully. There were like concentric circles on the rough side. No umpire could ever make anything out, he says.The secret is as a team to ensure youre never under scrutiny. Some teams even make sure only the most seedha saadha baccha (innocent-looking boy) is used to work on the ball, he adds.The tampering tools. The tampering tools.Sarfraz, the originalIt was of course a lot different when Sarfraz Nawaz was bamboozling batsmen the world over by rewriting the physics behind the movement of a cricket ball. The former Pakistan fast bowler is adamant that only those who didnt understand the science of reverse swing, or the nasamajh as he calls them, had to resort to tampering the ball. But he does admit that it was a lot easier back then to get away with working on the ball.The umpires wouldnt bother with keeping the ball. So teams would wait till the first 10 overs of the innings, and during the water-break, use everything from sand-paper to bottle caps to blades camouflaged in tapes over fingers to scratch one side of the ball, and nobody ever knew what they were doing, Nawaz tells The Sunday Express.While Nawaz is considered the inventor of reverse-swing, he played an integral role in the first-ever public controversy over ball-tampering when he sued Englands Allan Lamb for having accused the Pakistanis for ball tampering in 1992. He eventually won the case with everyone including Lamb testifying that Nawaz himself had never indulged in any corrupt practices with the ball. But Nawaz did witness video evidence of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Aaqib Javed openly scratching the ball with their nails during the case, and he still sounds surprised.At that point, Pakistanis were the only ones who knew exactly how to maintain a ball and get it ready for reverse-swing without having to tamper it. When Imran (Khan) and I played together none of the other fielders were allowed to shine the ball, he recalls. He adds how it then became a ritualistic passage of rites whenever a young fast bowler would join the ranks.Considering how competitive Pakistani fast bowlers of the time were, its not surprising when you hear about how one fast bowler, an expert at making the ball, would maintain it perfectly for his spell. But at the end of his spell, he would apply a lot of sweat on the rough side of the ball so that none of the others got any help from his work on the ball.Reverse swing is more about the bowler than the ball itself according to Nawaz. In addition to being able to bowl at a high speed you also need to develop a slingy release and try as far as possible to bowl into the wind. But it doesnt surprise him that teams would be keen to rough the ball up early.If you dont have the speed and wait for the natural deterioration, the reverse will be too slow to trouble the batsmen. But if you rough up a ball thats only 15 overs old, then its still hard with an upright seam. That way the movement will be quicker and you leave the batsmen with little time to adjust, explains Nawaz, who developed the art at Lahores Bagh-e-Jinnah ground, kept it to himself for four years before revealing it to Imran Khan on a tour to West Indies in 1974.Finding loopholesThough there are plenty of precedents for cricketers being pulled up like du Plessis for getting a little too comfortable with the ball in the last 25 years, fielding teams around the world have never died wondering in terms of devising new tactics to defy what many feel is a pedantic law.If John Lever was pulled up for using Vaseline over his eye-brows to help shine the ball, but one journeyman cricketer tells you that teams still walk out to field with the moisturizer laced on their trousers while some use glue. If not, theres always the sun-screen, hair gel or the lip balm that can be brought into play from time to time. For those who havent developed the taste for Murray Mints can always like Matt Prior go with jellybeans.Even when it comes to roughing up the ball, you can always play the law rather than play by it. Theres always the rogue throw to the wicket-keeper where the fielder is clearly focusing more on landing the rough side of the ball on the abrasive part of the hard square, forget about aiming at the stumps. Or like Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad kept doing a couple of years ago in the UAE, you step on the ball with your spikes accidentally. One domestic coach in Australia didnt find it wrong to rub the ball against the concrete outside the boundary ropes and throw it back in.Then theres Pat Symcox. A video on YouTube has the former South African off-spinner in a bizarre sequence from a Test in Australia in 1997 where he first seems to be scratching the ball before he  and this is at viewer discretion for graphic images are involved  lodges it in through the sleeve and rubs it against his arm-pits. The late Richie Benaud is the saving grace on commentary. Hello Patrick.some people use deodorant, others the leather of the ball, he says as Symcox continues to stink-up the ball.Theres also the business of lifting the quarter seam  the one that runs perpendicular to the main seam, cutting the ball into four quarters  by loosening the stitching, which is known to assist swing. Some even wedge pebbles inside the gap to make it heavier. You can never get caught with picking the quarter seam, says a player.But despite the sophisticated levels to which the art of making a ball has grown to, there still exists a tinge of naivety  we arent talking about Afridi sniffing at the ball with his teethwhen it comes to understanding the science.Merv Hughes recently recalled how Collin Miller once admitted to have scratched a ball that was only 3-overs-old to which the big fast bowler told the umpire, Can you please ask that idiot to stop scratching the ball? Theres also the case of Mike Atherton recalling how a young 12th man returned with the sugar-free Orbit when asked to get chewing gum.There have been voices and prominent ones like Richard Hadlee who have spoken about legalizing subtle ball tamperingas he called it in his 1994 columnletting players use whatever means on their persons like finger-nails to scratch the ball. Even as the ICC has tried to keep abreast, with the players constantly-innovative sleight of hand, bowlers from across generations have only echoed Hadlees words of there being more parity between bat and ball when it comes to justifying their intentions, especially when quality of bats keep improving on a daily basis and the rules continue favouring batsmen.As one player puts it, Most batsmen are licking their lips when they face us like in the Alpenliebe ad. So whats the harm if we chew on one instead and get the better of them?ITS NOT JUST THE BALL, YOU NEED TO BE FAST, SLINGY, ACCURATE, STRONG TO GET REVERSE SWING:THE SCIENCEFielding teams do their best to maintain the shine on one side of the ball while keeping the other side rough and worn. The shiny side also needs to be kept smooth so that the air passes over the side quicker than it does on the rough side due to friction, ensuring that the ball moves in the direction of the shine. It is basic aerodynamics.DEGREE Of DIFFICULTYTheoretically, even a club bowler operating at medium-pace can reverse-swing a ball thats been made for him. But movement, unconventional as it might be, at that pace will hardly bother an international batsman.NOT EVERYONES CUP OF TEAThe delivery has to be bowled at well over 85 mph at least. The batsman shouldnt be given the time to adjust to the late movement.You also need to change your action slightly to make it whippier or slingier like a Waqar Younis to generate that late movement. No wonder Sarfraz Nawaz feels Jeff Thomson would have been the greatest exponent of reverse swing because of his action, if only the Australian had a clue about it.The length needs to be fuller than usual too, even if its closer to a half-volley.Bowlers need to bowl into the wind as it will assist the ball moving towards the shiny side. When you are bowling downwind there is no resistance for the ball to encounter and therefore the swing is seriously curtailed.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"
