(Source: PTI) Chris Woakes stressed England are still in the series after losing the second Test in Vizag and trail five-match series 1-0. (Source: PTI)Going into the third Test after their loss in the previous tie, England bowlers are wary of Indian skipper Virat Kohlis form and have come up with plans to get him out early knowing well that he tends to get a big score once he is well set. India scripted a resounding 246-run win over England in the second cricket Test to take a 1-0 lead in the five match series.While skipper Virat Kohlis aggregate of 248 runs (167 and 81) laid the cornerstone of victory, the contribution of Indias premier all-rounder Ashwin (52 runs and match figures of 8/119) was equally significant.England all-rounder Chris Woakes, who impressed with his bowling in the opening Test, felt that it was crucial to dismiss Kohli early on. Speaking about Kohlis performance in the previous Test, Woakes said, Kohli scored lot of those runs, Pujara has also scored. Kohli has scored majority of runs, particularly in that second Test match. So, we are going to have plans to him to try and stop him scoring Once he gets in, its hard to get him out.Despite the humiliating loss, Woakes felt that all was not lost and England have a good chance to bounce back.I feel that the teams are fairly evenly matched, he said, at the same time acknowledging that India were playing in their home conditions.To another question, he said, Although we have lost that last Test match, we felt that we have played some good cricket on this tour barring a session maybe.While pointing out that toss will play a role, he also said, We obviously do have to win here to make sure we can win the series..everyone is in good spirits (on team morale after previous loss).About his own form after being rested in the previous tie, he said he was fit and raring to go.When asked that bowlers always have niggles and if he felt disappointed to miss you given the way he bowled in the first game, Woakes said, Yeah, I suppose you always want to play, you dont want to miss any Test match, particularly when you feel you are in decent form and decent nick. Yeah, I suppose its one of those things which happens..On missing the services of their fast bowling spearhead Stuart Broad, Woakes said, Obviously, it will be a huge loss if Stuart doesnt play..he is a world class bowler, he has been there for a long period of time. He has showed how good he is in one spell he bowled, I think it was one of the morning sessions, the last Test match.When asked if he feels Mohali, traditionally known to favour fast bowlers, is the venue where England can boost their seam attack given, Woakes replied, saying, potentially, may beas you mentioned there has been history here that potentially might help the seamers a little bit better but then same time last years Test match it was just the opposite.Woakes fielded a volley of questions surrounding ongoing Sweet-Gate in context to what happened with the South African team in Australia and also in the ongoing series in India. He said he feels there were grey areas which need to be clarified.Asked about sweetgate controversy in the series between Australia and South Africa, Woakes replied, I think they have said that everyone tries to shine the ball The fact that (South African skipper) Faf du Plessis has been fined by the ICC..I suppose there is quite a grey area there, isnt there. Hashim Amla said about him having chewing gum in his mouth, pretty much all day. I am not sure if it is deemed wrong, I am not sure. it needs to be clarified as to exactly what the problem is.To another related question, he said, We wont change anything that we do, there is cameras always on you, always has been, so there is nothing we need to change.He also said during drinks break, guys will come and have sweets or mints just to re-energise and freshen up, to keep the energy going. Nothing more than that..And when you are really tired and the opposition is getting on to you, a lolly does help in boosting energy, he said, adding sometimes we take energy drink but he was not not sure how much sugar they carry in the mouth, saying it is a grey area.At the same time, he added, If the ICC feels that this should be banned and this should not go to pitch, maybe it is the way to do it. We do what we do. We have not been fined or banned, so we would continue to do what we were in the past.Meanwhile, when asked about his own bowling, Woakes replied, we always have to find ways of troubling the batsmen, particularly in these conditions, when generally there is not much help to get that seam movement.On his own pace, he said pace to world class batsmen, sometimes doesnt matter too much if its not on target, so accuracy is all that important. I just try to put the ball in the right areas, try to get the side movement and trouble the batsman, he said.On the Mohali track, he said, whether the pitch will spin on day one, I am not sure, but at some point it is going to spin, we have gone with three on three over the last two Test matches and the wicket doesnt seem to look too different to those.Asked if he believes Jos Butler has the ability to adapt and do a good job, Woakes said, he is a brilliant one-day player. He has obviously showed that, he has been in a good form on this tour from that Bangladesh series, he was probably our best player on that series in similar conditionseveryone knows that Joss is a naturally attacking player.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

590a27bb7be9e033b96eb583,A look at US food policy and potential Trump changes,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/a-look-at-food-policy-and-potential-trump-changes-4376801/,2016-11-15,"Trump hasnt weighed in on school meals, but Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt, a member of his agricultural advisory committee, says there likely will be new efforts to revise the rules. (File Photo) Trump hasnt weighed in on school meals, but Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt, a member of his agricultural advisory committee, says there likely will be new efforts to revise the rules. (File Photo)The Obama administration was the first to significantly raise the profile of food policy, championing laws and pushing through regulation to make food safer, more nutritious and better labeled.A look at some of those policies, and what may happen to them in a Trump administration:SCHOOL MEALS: First lady Michelle Obama made healthier school meals one of her signature issues. A Democratic Congress passed legislation expanding healthier standards for school foods in 2010, and Mrs. Obama successfully fended off Republican attempts to scale them back. Trump hasnt weighed in on school meals, but Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt, a member of his agricultural advisory committee, says there likely will be new efforts to revise the rules.FOOD SAFETY: A food safety law signed by President Barack Obama five years ago requires farmers to test irrigation water quality, regularly train workers on the best health and hygiene practices and monitor wildlife that may intrude on growing fields, among other measures. It also increases inspections in food manufacturing facilities. A fact sheet issued by the Trump campaign in September criticized the food safety rules, but that language was deleted in a second version of the memo.NUTRITION FACTS: The Food and Drug Administration issued a new version of the Nutrition Facts labels that are on the backs of food packages, the first overhaul of the label since its introduction in 1994. The sugar industry has objected to a new line that breaks out the amount of added sugars. The rules are in place, but most food companies have until July 2018 to comply.CALORIES ON MENUS: Passed by Congress as part of health care overhaul in 2010, the rules will require restaurants and other establishments that sell prepared foods and have 20 or more locations to post the calorie content of food clearly and conspicuously on their menus, menu boards and displays. The supermarket industry has strongly pushed back on the rules, saying they would be more burdensome for them than for restaurants, which typically have more limited offerings. The rules will be enforced starting next May.PHASING OUT TRANS FATS: The FDA announced in 2015 that it was requiring food companies to largely rid their foods of the artery-clogging fats over several years, calling them a threat to public health. But the rules allow food companies to petition to use trans fats sparingly in some foods, and the agency is currently considering what foods can be exempted.SODIUM GUIDELINES: The FDA earlier this year proposed long-awaited sodium guidelines in an effort to prevent thousands of deaths each year from heart disease and stroke. The guidelines are voluntary, so food companies wont be required to comply, and the agency hasnt yet announced final guidelines. The food industry has pushed back, saying companies have already reduced sodium in many foods.ANTIBIOTICS: The administration announced a plan last year to fight the threat posed by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. While overuse in humans is the leading concern, the administration has worked to curb use in animals processed for meat, as well. Its unclear if the Trump administration would continue that effort, which has met with some resistance from the meat industry.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Reuters) San Francisco, California is one of the four cities to pass the soda tax. (Source: Reuters)Three California cities voted for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages and another in Colorado was likely to follow suit, unofficial election results showed on Wednesday, as local governments push to cut soda consumption to stem obesity gathered speed. The votes on so-called soda taxes in San Francisco, Albany and Oakland in California and in Boulder, Colorado, came a month after the World Health Organization recommended governments impose such taxes to battle obesity, diabetes and other diet-related diseases.Watch What Else Is Making NewsTax proponents have recorded a series of victories in the United States this year, after numerous failed attempts.Opponents argue that the taxes hit lower-income populations hardest, and that it is unfair to single out soda in the battle to fight obesity and diabetes. They also question the effectiveness of such taxes.Larry Tramutola, a California political strategist who organized the pro-tax campaigns in San Francisco and Oakland, said the victory was huge, adding: This is the start of a national movement.Philadelphia earlier this year passed a levy on soft drinks, pitched as a way to fill a budget shortfall via a tactic that other politicians and advocates have also adopted.Im sure that other cities and states will look at this and put tax measures before their legislatures, said Michael Jacobson, co-founder and president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. Legislators will say, We get a twofer: balance the budget and improve public health.'The next soda tax vote is set for Cook County, Illinois, on Thursday.Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc. and other companies in the roughly $100 billion U.S. soft drink industry are fighting the taxes at a time when soda consumption is falling.They point instead to their efforts to reformulate products and broaden the range of drinks they offer to address consumers health concerns. More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese.Our energy remains squarely focused on reducing the sugar consumed from beverages, a spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association said in an emailed statement.Shares in Pepsi and Coca Cola were both down nearly 2 percent, while Dr. Pepper Snapple Group was off 3.4 percent on Wednesday as the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.9 percent.Spending from both camps has soared this year as billionaire advocates for the tax, including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, joined the fray.For soda companies, the effects of the taxes on volumes and profits may be muted. In Mexico, which introduced a tax in 2014, per capita consumption dropped after the tax was introduced. But the impact on companies like Pepsi was offset by population growth and strong demand of non-fizzy beverages.This is more of a headline risk than a fundamental risk. It doesnt have an enormous impact on the companies themselves, as long as the (size of) taxes are within the realm of reason, said Ali Dibadj, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.Long-term, the effects could be greater if the taxes are increased and if more jurisdictions introduce them.In San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, the taxes will be a penny per ounce, the same as in neighboring Berkeley, where voters passed a levy in 2014. In Boulder, the vote was for a 2-cent-per-ounce tax.The San Francisco measure passed 62 percent to 38 percent and the Albany measure passed 71 percent to 29 percent. The Oakland measure had 61 percent in favor and 39 percent opposed, and in Boulder the soda tax was passing 54 percent to 46 percent, with over three-quarters of the ballots counted.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Gradually, there is a shift towards higher green tea consumption, as the awareness of its health benefits increase, says teamonkglobal.com, an online portal for speciality teas.We offer a range of Signature Teas carefully selected from the best tea gardens for a unique tea taste experience and amazing refreshment for the consumer. The pricing for the products at the launch-phase starts from approximately Rs 325, and goes up to Rs 750 per 100 gm. Our portfolio includes a range of pure and natural Nilgiri green teas with natural ingredients like cardamom, cinnamon, tulsi, jasmine, ginger, peppermint and spearmint, says Teamonk Global MD Ashok Mittal.So what is a speciality tea? Mittal explains, Unlike mass produced CTC (cut tear curl) varieties of teas consumed with milk and sugar by majority of Indians, speciality teas are handpicked and curated from the best tea plantations in India. Speciality teas which are long leaf (orthodox ) include black, white, oolong and green tea variants. Right from the selection of the gardens where these teas are grown to the quality of the tea plant clone, leaf-plucking format till the end of the process, where these teas are packed involves personal non-mechanised handling.The firm sources tea leaves mostly from the high-grown areas of Darjeeling and Nilgiris. Our strategic alliance with the best tea plantations engaged in speciality tea manufacturing is an exclusive tie-up. It helps us create a portfolio curated as per our requirements, Mittal says.The process involves identifying and plucking the most delicate and tender two leaves and a bud from select tea bushes in a specified area, Mittal says.In case of black teas there is a controlled oxidation of the rolled tea leaves followed by drying to control oxidation, rendering a distinct colour and aroma. Green teas do not go through oxidation and are either pan-dried or steamed to render a natural raw taste to the tea leaves. Oolong teas are partially oxidised and dried to give it a unique taste experience of green and black, Mittal added.The six-month-old bootstrapped company is committed to deliver fresh and unique taste experience to the tea-lovers around the world. This could include selling through online and offline formats as long as it delivers on the core brand promise. We are looking to associate with all major ecommerce players including Amazon, Flipkart, SnapDeal, BigBasket and Godrej Natures Basket. We are currently live on Amazon and will shortly go live on other portals, Mittal said."
590a301a7be9e033b96eba5c,Egypt: resentment against Sisi mounting,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/580048/egypt-resentment-against-sisi-mounting.html,2016-11-08,"Egypt: resentment against Sisi mountingBy Michael Jansen, Nov 09, 2016, 23:31 ISTEgyptians threaten to launch a Revolt of the Poor on Nov 11 to protest soaring prices, lack of clean drinking water, shortage of sugar and cooking oil, cutting fuel subsidies, and new taxes.The movements Facebook page has more than 1,00,000 followers who are urged to oust the corrupt regime and liberate the country from those who have betrayed and humiliated the Egyptian people.In mid-October, an anonymous tuk-tuk (auto) driver castigated the government headed by President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi for investing billions of dollars in high profile developments but spending little on providing food, education, agriculture and health care for the countrys struggling poor.You watch Egyptian television and (Cairos) like Vienna, you go out in the street and its like Somalias cousin. We had sufficient sugar and enough rice before the last presidential election and we even exported it... They squander our money on so-called national projects that are useless and education in Eg-ypt is very bad, even worse than you can imagine, he told an independent television channel.The video was picked up by social media and viewed by millions before it was removed, prompting angry Egyptians to accuse the government of repressing criticism of its rule and the authorities to mount fresh arrests of dissidents.Cairo has serious reasons for concern. The widely watched video was followed by the self-immolation of a taxi driver in the port city of Alexandria to condemn rising costs. The 2011 Arab Spring uprising across the Arab world was triggered when a Tunisian vegetable vendor set himself alight to protest police harassment.Few Egyptians believe the Revolt of the Poor could draw tens of thousands to Cairo's iconic Tahrir (Liberation) Square as did the demonstration on January 25, 2011, and over the next 17 days, topping 30-year president Hosni Mubarak.However, the volatile situation is unpredictable. Organisers of the 2011 event had told Deccan Herald at that time they had not expected more than 150 to turn up in response to the social media call for a rally. Over 50,000 took part.The crackdown on all dissent since the army ousted president Muhammad Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood stalwart, in July 2013, has united the opposition consisting of supporters of the outlawed Brotherhood and the marginalised secular revolutionaries who led the 2011 mass campaign.Army chief Sisi  who both removed and succeeded Morsi  was elected president by 97% of voters who expected him to address the demands of the uprising: Bread, freedom and social justice. He has failed to do so, turning Egyptians against him and undermining the respect enjoyed by the army.Todays conditions are very different from the days of the uprising. At that time, riot police and security officers attacked the protesters with birdshot, water cannon and lathis.The army stayed aloof, prom-pting demonstrators to shout, The people and army are one hand! Today, the army is blam-ed for the collapse of the economy, the suppression of political dissent, massive spending on trophy projects and corruption.Finally, Morsis ouster unleashed anti-government attacks by Brotherhood backers and prompted jihadis linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State to step up violence against the army and police in the Sinai Peninsula and mount operations in Cairo and elsewhere.Getting priorities wrongSisi would have had nothing to worry about if he had halted the collapse of the economy. Enlargement of the Suez Canal, a main revenue source, has failed to bring in more money.Money invested in a nuclear power plant and a new administrative centre outside Cairo was ludicrous at a time 40% of 94 million Egyptians live below the poverty line. Sisi got his priorities wrong. Soaring prices of state-subsidised food deny Egyptians sustenance while the lack of schools, health centres, and jobs deny Egyptians a decent future.Egypt has only $19.6 billion in foreign exchange reserves. Due to the low price of oil and strained relations between Cairo and Riyadh, Egypt can no longer expect huge injections of Saudi cash  $25 billion since 2011  to keep the country afloat.The lack of Saudi funds could not have come at a worse time for the economy. Tourism has fallen dramatically, imports are being reduced, and the currency is in free fall until the governm-ent devalued it by 48% and announced it would be allowed to float. This will increase costs for manufacturers and importers, including those who bring in rice, sugar and other essentials.Faced with demands for parliament to vote no confidence in the government, Prime Minister Sherif Ismail argued Egypt's economic collapse is due to the failure of former governments to embrace radical reform or make difficult decisions.Unfortunately, the difficult decisions his government is facing include the International Monetary Funds demand to raise taxes and reduce subsidies in exchange for a $12 billion loan, moves that could fuel the Revolt of the Poor whether or not it manages to mount protests on Nov 11 or not."

The allegations though wont hold any ground as neither the on-field umpires nor the match referee reported the alleged incident. Also, the England team didnt lodge any complaint within the stipulated five days after the completion of the match as per ICC regulations for such an allegation to be investigated.Indian coach Anil Kumble wasnt a happy man when asked about his take on the allegations. First of all, I dont want to react to any report that is in the media, he thundered. As far as I am concerned, neither the umpires nor match referee ever came to us talking about it. Even for someone like Faf du Plessis... South Africa has played exceptional cricket to beat Australia 2-0 and to be told about this ball tampering or whatever, I think it is very silly. Its making a mountain out of a molehill. Something we would certainly not like to give too much wind to the story.As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to worry about. People can allege and write whatever they want in the media. As far as we are concerned, there is absolutely nothing that any of our players were part of.England fast bowler Chris Woakes felt there are too many grey areas when it comes to players shining the ball, something that is done almost every ball.Everyone has said they try to shine the ball in a similar fashion. I think the fact Faf du Plessis has been fined, the ICC are trying to make a stance on it but I suppose there is a grey area there. Hashim Amla said about him having chewing gum in his mouth pretty much all day. Is that deemed as wrong and as cheating? Im not sure.I think it needs to be clarified to exactly what the problem is. If youre exactly placing a sweet on the ball that is obviously against the rules but everything else seems to be a little bit of a grey area.Gatorade (an energy drink) has sugar in it as well. We take those drinks on board and then lick our tongue and put that on the ball so thats a grey area as well. Is that classed as a sugary substance going on the ball? I dont know.DH News Service"
590a30f07be9e033b96ebb11,Early detection key to combat diabetes,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/580916/early-detection-key-combat-diabetes.html,2016-11-13,"Early detection key to combat diabetesBy Pandurang Hegde, Nov 14, 2016, 0:40 ISTAccording to the World Health Organisation, India is home to 62 million diabetic patients, the highest followed by China. There are clear indicators of this disease becoming an epidemic afflicting more than 100 million people by 2020.Diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin (type 1 diabetes), or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces (type 2 diabetes). This leads to raised blood glucose (sugar) level and, over time, serious damage to many of the bodys systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.In India, type 2 diabetes is on the increase among the younger age group due to intake of high-calorie diet and a sedentary lifestyle. This disease is not restricted to the affluent class alone, even the lower middle class and poor sections of the society are prone to this disease.What makes the situation more complicated is that our healthcare system is unable to diagnose the presence of the disease at an early stage. Almost 50% of the people suffering from diabetes are unaware of its presence. Early identification is the key to effective management of the disease.mDiabetesEfforts are being made towards early detection using inexpensive technologies and through affordable medications. However, the healthcare infrastructure of the government does not have the capacity to treat and manage the large number of patients across the country.Recognising this fact, Health Minister J P Nadda called for implementing the programme to screen the mass population to identify the onset of the disease. He also launched the mDiabetes initiative, which is aimed at harnessing the mobile network to tackle the disease. The National Health Mission launched by the Government of India has established special cells at state and district levels towards this end, too.Why is there such a large number of people suffering from diabetes in our country? In addition to lifestyle causes, Indians have a high genetic susceptibility to this disease. It is estimated that between 12% to 18% of adult population living in urban areas are suffering from diabetes. More young people will be joining the ranks in the coming years with high levels of obesity being reported among children.Typically, type 2 diabetes was considered a disorder of the elderly and the middle-aged. A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research showed the shift of diabetes towards the younger age group, between 25 to 34 years. These are the most productive years of the work force and if an earning member of the family is affected, it has adverse consequences for the whole society.High health costsAccording to the World Economic Forum, the economic burden of diabetes alone will be USD 0.15 trillion per year on India. The average health costs of a diabetes patient is three times higher than that of a normal person, with an estimated cost of Rs 10,000 per annum required for treatment.As poorer patients cannot afford the high costs, non-compliance leads to severe complications, adversely affecting the working life of those suffering from diabetes.Diabetes leads to complications causing kidney failure that involves huge dialysis costs. It also causes retinopathy, leading to vision loss in adult working population. It may also increase the chances of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks. All these add to high costs of treatment.Increased consumption of junk food, processed foods rich in carbohydrates and drinks with high sugar content is a major factor contributing to the spread of the disease.Despite this, the government is not willing to address the issue by levying additional tax on such food products. Kerala is the only state that has imposed tax on junk food as a preventive measure to control the spread of this epidemic.Adopting a healthy diet comprising balanced portions of carbohydrates, protein and fats is essential to prevent the onset of the disease. Physical activity, daily exercise and a regular practice of yoga have to become part of everyday life so that the disease is kept at bay. This will help keep the blood sugar under control and ensure a normal healthy life for a diabetic. There is possibility of reducing 80% of type 2 diabetes through such preventive measures.India has already acquired the dubious title of being the diabetes capital of the world. With wrong food policies, lack of basic healthcare facilities to provide preventive and curative care to treat the disease, we are sitting on a diabetes time bomb waiting to explode in the coming years.In order to diffuse this threat, there is an urgent need to launch an integrated strategy to prevent and control diabetes with the involvement of multiple sectors of the society."
590a31187be9e033b96ebb32,"Make sugary drinks costly, unaffordable",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/582349/make-sugary-drinks-costly-unaffordable.html,2016-11-21,"Nov 22, 2016, 0:04 ISTA recent report of the World Health Organisation (WHO) calling upon all governments to impose deterrent taxes on sugary drinks has again drawn attention to the danger posed to public health by these drinks. The WHO advocates high taxes in the range of 20%-50% which would raise the prices of sugary drinks to such levels that most people would be discouraged from buying them. It wants all sugary drinks, energy and sports drinks, beverages like flavoured and breakfast drinks and even fruit juices to be taxed because the sugar content in all of them can cause serious health ailments. It recommends consumption of fruit in place of juices and recommends payment of subsidies for fruit which will bring down their prices and increase consumption. It has proposed a price-based strategy to reduce consumption of sugar to go along with public awareness campaigns.Consumption of sugar is a major cause of many serious ailments and health conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and obesity. The WHO recommends a sugar intake of not more than 5% of total daily calories or six tea spoons a day; it even says that, nutritionally, there is no need for sugar in the diet. The harmful impact of sugar has been known for long and it has been described as white poison. It is considered to be worse than fat for the body. Diabetes and obesity have been increasing all over the world in the past few decades. India is at great risk because of the increase in such cases. It is called the diabetes capital of the world. Obesity is increasing among children also. Changes in dietary habits and contents and sedentary lifestyles are among the main reasons for the deteriorating health profiles. Sugary beverages account for a major part of sugar consumption.Some countries like France and Mexico have imposed high taxes on sugary drinks. The WHO has noted that they have been able to reduce sugar consumption. A number of American cities, too, have recently imposed high taxes on them. Britain is considering whether to impose high taxes on all sugary beverages or to ban them altogether. The sugary drinks industry has a high lobbying power, and even data based on sponsored research to counter any move against the drinks. India should also consider the high-tax strategy to reduce sugar consumption. A 5% tax was imposed two years ago, but a higher tax can be considered in the interest of public health. The high fat tax imposed by Kerala this year on some food items is a good precedent."

Kohli has scored majority of runs, particularly in that second Test match. So, we are going to have plans to him to try and stop him scoring... Once he gets in, it's hard to get him out.""Despite the humiliating loss, Woakes felt that all was not lost and England have a good chance to bounce back.""I feel that the teams are fairly evenly matched,"" he said, at the same time acknowledging that India were playing in their home conditions.To another question, he said, ""Although we have lost that last Test match, we felt that we have played some good cricket on this tour barring a session maybe"".While pointing out that toss will play a role, he also said, ""We obviously do have to win here to make sure we can win the series..everyone is in good spirits (on team morale after previous loss).""About his own form after being rested in the previous tie, he said he was ""fit and raring to go"".When asked that bowlers always have niggles and if he felt disappointed to miss you given the way he bowled in the first game, Woakes said, ""Yeah, I suppose you always want to play, you don't want to miss any Test match, particularly when you feel you are in decent form and decent nick. Yeah, I suppose its one of those things which happens..""On missing the services of their fast bowling spearhead Stuart Broad, Woakes said, ""Obviously, it will be a huge loss if Stuart doesn't play..he is a world class bowler, he has been there for a long period of time. He has showed how good he is in one spell he bowled, I think it was one of the morning sessions, the last Test match.""When asked if he feels Mohali, traditionally known to favour fast bowlers, is the venue where England can boost their seam attack given, Woakes replied, saying, ""potentially, may be...as you mentioned there has been history here that potentially might help the seamers a little bit better but then same time last year's Test match it was just the opposite.""Woakes fielded a volley of questions surrounding ongoing ""Sweet-Gate"" in context to what happened with the South African team in Australia and also in the ongoing series in India. He said he feels there were ""grey areas"" which need to be clarified.Asked about ""sweetgate"" controversy in the series between Australia and South Africa, Woakes replied, ""I think they have said that everyone tries to shine the ball... The fact that (South African skipper) Faf du Plessis has been fined by the ICC..I suppose there is quite a grey area there, isn't there. Hashim Amla said about him having chewing gum in his mouth, pretty much all day. I am not sure if it is deemed wrong, I am not sure. ...it needs to be clarified as to exactly what the problem is.""To another related question, he said, ""We won't change anything that we do, there is camera's always on you, always has been, so there is nothing we need to change.""He also said during drinks break, guys will come and have sweets or mints just to re-energise and freshen up, to keep the energy going.""Nothing more than that..And when you are really tired and the opposition is getting on to you, a lolly does help in boosting energy,"" he said, adding sometimes we take energy drink but he was not not sure how much sugar they carry in the mouth, saying it is a grey area.At the same time, he added, ""If the ICC feels that this should be banned and this should not go to pitch, maybe it is the way to do it. We do what we do. We have not been fined or banned, so we would continue to do what we were in the past.""Meanwhile, when asked about his own bowling, Woakes replied, ""we always have to find ways of troubling the batsmen, particularly in these conditions, when generally there is not much help to get that seam movement.""On his own pace, he said pace to world class batsmen, sometimes doesn't matter too much if its not on target, so accuracy is all that important.""I just try to put the ball in the right areas, try to get the side movement and trouble the batsman,"" he said.On the Mohali track, he said, ""whether the pitch will spin on day one, I am not sure, but at some point it is going to spin, we have gone with three on three over the last two Test matches and the wicket doesn't seem to look too different to those.""Asked if he believes Jos Butler has the ability to adapt and do a good job, Woakes said, ""he is a brilliant one-day player. He has obviously showed that, he has been in a good form on this tour from that Bangladesh series, he was probably our best player on that series in similar conditions...everyone knows that Joss is a naturally attacking player."""
590a322a7be9e033b96ebc22,"Cuba's Fidel Castro, who defied US for 50 years, has died",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/583205/cubas-fidel-castro-defied-us.html,2016-11-26,"Havana, Nov 26, 2016, (AP) 17:02 ISTFormer President Fidel Castro, who led a rebel army to improbable victory in Cuba, embraced Soviet-style communism and defied the power of 10 US presidents during his half century rule, has died at age 90.With a shaking voice, President Raul Castro said on state television that his older brother died at 10:29 p.m. Friday. He ended the announcement by shouting the revolutionary slogan: ""Toward victory, always!""Cuba's government announced that Castro's ashes would be interred on December 4 in the eastern city of Santiago that was a birthplace of his revolution. That will follow more than a week of honors, including a nearly nationwide caravan retracing, in reverse, his tour from Santiago to Havana with the triumph of the revolution in 1959.Castro's reign over the island-nation 90 miles from Florida was marked by the US-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis a year later that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.The bearded revolutionary, who survived a crippling US trade embargo as well as dozens, possibly hundreds, of assassination plots, died 10 years after ill health forced him to hand power over to Raul.Castro overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, exile in Mexico and a disastrous start to his rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana in January 1959 to become, at age 32, the youngest leader in Latin America. For decades, he served as an inspiration and source of support to revolutionaries from Latin America to Africa.His commitment to socialism was unwavering, though his power finally began to fade in mid-2006 when a gastrointestinal ailment forced him to hand over the presidency to Raul in 2008, provisionally at first and then permanently. His defiant image lingered long after he gave up his trademark Cohiba cigars for health reasons and his tall frame grew stooped.""Socialism or death"" remained Castro's rallying cry even as Western-style democracy swept the globe and other communist regimes in China and Vietnam embraced capitalism, leaving this island of 11 million people an economically crippled Marxist curiosity.He survived long enough to see Raul Castro negotiate an opening with US President Barack Obama on December 17, 2014, when Washington and Havana announced they would move to restore diplomatic ties for the first time since they were severed in 1961. He cautiously blessed the historic deal with his lifelong enemy in a letter published after a month-long silence. Obama made a historic visit to Havana in March 2016.Carlos Rodriguez, 15, was sitting in Havana's Miramar neighborhood when he heard that Fidel Castro had died. ""Fidel? Fidel?"" he said, slapping his head in shock. ""That's not what I was expecting. One always thought that he would last forever. It doesn't seem true.""Fidel Castro Ruz was born August 13, 1926, in eastern Cuba's sugar country, where his Spanish immigrant father worked first recruiting labor for US sugar companies and later built up a prosperous plantation of his own.Castro attended Jesuit schools, then the University of Havana, where he received law and social science degrees. His life as a rebel began in 1953 with a reckless attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago.Most of his comrades were killed and Fidel and his brother Raul went to prison. Fidel turned his trial defence into a manifesto that he smuggled out of jail, famously declaring, ""History will absolve me.""Freed under a pardon, Castro fled to Mexico and organized a rebel band that returned in 1956, sailing across the Gulf of Mexico to Cuba on a yacht named Granma. After losing most of his group in a bungled landing, he rallied support in Cuba's eastern Sierra Maestra mountains.Three years later, tens of thousands spilled into the streets of Havana to celebrate Batista's downfall and catch a glimpse of Castro as his rebel caravan arrived in the capital on January 8, 1959.The US was among the first to formally recognize his government, cautiously trusting Castro's early assurances he merely wanted to restore democracy, not install socialism. Within months, Castro was imposing radical economic reforms.Members of the old government went before summary courts, and at least 582 were shot by firing squads over two years. Independent newspapers were closed and in the early years, homosexuals were herded into camps for ""re-education.""In 1964, Castro acknowledged holding 15,000 political prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled, including Castro's daughter Alina Fernandez Revuelta and his younger sister Juana.Still, the revolution thrilled millions in Cuba and across Latin America who saw it as an example of how the seemingly arrogant Yankees could be defied. And many on the island were happy to see the seizure of property of the landed class, the expulsion of American gangsters and the closure of their casinos.Castro's speeches, lasting up to six hours, became the soundtrack of Cuban life and his 269-minute speech to the UN General Assembly in 1960 set the world body's record for length that still stood more than five decades later.As Castro moved into the Soviet bloc, Washington began working to oust him, cutting US purchases of sugar, the island's economic mainstay. Castro, in turn, confiscated USD 1 billion in US assets.The American government imposed a trade embargo, banning virtually all US exports to the island except for food and medicine, and it severed diplomatic ties on January 3, 1961.On April 16 of that year, Castro declared his revolution to be socialist, and the next day, about 1,400 Cuban exiles stormed the beach at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast. But the CIA-backed invasion failed.The debacle forced the US to give up on the idea of invading Cuba, but that didn't stop Washington and Castro's exiled enemies from trying to do him in. By Cuban count, he was the target of more than 630 assassination plots by militant Cuban exiles or the US government.The biggest crisis of the Cold War between Washington and Moscow exploded on October 22, 1962, when President John F. Kennedy announced there were Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba and imposed a naval blockade of the island.Humankind held its breath, and after a tense week of diplomacy, Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev removed them. Never had the world felt so close to nuclear war. Castro cobbled revolutionary groups together into the new Cuban Communist Party, with him as first secretary. Labor unions lost the right to strike. The Catholic Church and other religious institutions were harassed. Neighborhood ""revolutionary defense committees"" kept an eye on everyone.Castro exported revolution to Latin American countries in the 1960s, and dispatched Cuban troops to Africa to fight Western-backed regimes in the 1970s. Over the decades, he sent Cuban doctors abroad to tend to the poor, and gave sanctuary to fugitive Black Panther leaders from the US.But the collapse of the Soviet bloc ended billions in preferential trade and subsidies for Cuba, sending its economy into a tailspin. Castro briefly experimented with an opening to foreign capitalists and limited private enterprise.As the end of the Cold War eased global tensions, many Latin American and European countries re-established relations with Cuba. In January 1998, Pope John Paul II visited a nation that had been officially atheist until the early 1990s.Aided by a tourism boom, the economy slowly recovered and Castro steadily reasserted government control, stifling much of the limited free enterprise tolerated during harder times.As flamboyant as he was in public, Castro tried to lead a discreet private life. He and his first wife, Mirta Diaz Balart, had one son before divorcing in 1956. Then, for more than four decades, Castro had a relationship with Dalia Soto del Valle. They had five sons together and were said to have married quietly in 1980.By the time Castro resigned 49 years after his triumphant arrival in Havana, he was the world's longest ruling head of government, aside from monarchs. In retirement, Castro voiced unwavering support as Raul slowly but deliberately enacted sweeping changes to the Marxist system he had built.His longevity allowed the younger brother to consolidate control, perhaps lengthening the revolution well past both men's lives. In February 2013, Raul announced that he would retire as president in 2018 and named newly minted Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel as his successor.""I'll be 90 years old soon,"" Castro said at an April 2016 Communist Party congress where he made his most extensive public appearance in years. ""Soon I'll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban Communists will remain as proof that on this planet, if one works with fervor and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need and that need to be fought for without ever giving up."""

An RBI circular said that banks will not be questioning customers depositing old notes if their accounts are compliant under know your customer (KYC) norms.Starting from November 8, on the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation, the RBI issued fours notification, the apex bank has almost tweaked the notification every working day.The highest number of notifications (six) came on November 14  asking banks to waive ATM charges on withdrawals between November 10 and December 30, constituting task force to oversee recalibration and reactivation of ATMs, under deputy governor S S Mundra, allowing current account holders to withdraw up to Rs 50,000 a week, all in Rs 2,000 denomination notes, allowing banks to hire retired employees for a short period of time to reduce work load at branches, asking banks to open bank accounts for workers at plantations, sugar cooperatives, dairy farms and other such groups, and asking banks to use mobile vans to allow exchange, deposit and withdrawal services in unbanked areas.Economists have also bluffed these constant tweaks by RBI. This constant flip-flop is wrecking havoc on the economy, Vivek Moorthy, Professor IIM Bangalore said. The RBI seems to follow Cancel-My-Last-Announcement policy, Moorthy, who was formerly Senior Economist with the Federal Reserve, said."

(Source: Reuters) In Britain, the Bank of England has made a strong admission. (Source: Reuters)In Britain, the Bank of England has made a strong admission. The new five pound notes in circulation contains traces of beef tallow. It issued a statement saying,We can confirm that the polymer pellet from which the base substrate is made contains a trace of a substance known as tallow.It had responded to a concern tweeted by a customer:@bankofengland Hello. Ive heard the new 5 has tallow in it which is derived from animal fat. Can you please let me know if this is correct  Jools (@Jools_Orca) November 28, 2016The Bank of England replied saying:Hi @Jools_Orca there is a trace of tallow in the polymer pallets used in the base substrate of the polymer 5 notes  Bank of England (@bankofengland) November 28, 2016As the news made headlines, British Hindu leaders and temple priests voiced surprise and outrage. Concerns were raised that while introducing the polymer currency why did the central bank fail to mention this crucial detail.Watch what else is making newsThe new polymer note is plastic currency, which means that it doesnt tear, its waterproof and it resists dirt. But it contains animal fat. Polymer is made of tallow, a by-product of animal waste derived from beef or mutton. Its the same polymer used in plastic bags to avoid friction, to make them anti-static and ensure that the bags dont stick to each other. That is the same reason why the new plastic five pound notes have minute amounts of tallow in them.However, the Hindu temples in Britain have refused to be associated with any product or by-product of animals. It has asked worshippers not to use the five pound notes for donations, while the British Hindu leaders will discuss the possible withdrawal of these notes from circulation.For the record, many among Hindus follow the ritual of animal sacrifice to please the gods. In fact, stories relating to animal sacrifice have even been present in the Indian mythology. The famous Dashashwamedh ghat in Varanasi, for example, got its name from the belief that Lord Brahma sacrificed ten horses there.If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of things, then there are several products available in the market that contain animal fat in them. Lipsticks are known to contain animal fat, so do soaps and candles. If we extrapolate the priests reasoning, then all Hindu women should not visit a temple or go elsewhere wearing makeup. The tyres of bicycles contain stearic acid, which is made using animal fat. Certainly Hindus then should not bike their way to a temple. Bone char is used to process sugar. PETA informs on its website that bone char is made using cattle bones from countries like India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, which is then supplied to other countries. It writes, Bone charoften referred to as natural carbonis widely used by the sugar industry as a decolorizing filter, which allows the sugar cane to achieve its desirable white color. In effect then, Hindus in Britain and elsewhere should abstain from consuming sugar.Dont get me wrong, Im all for putting the brakes on cruelty against animals. Before anything else however, lets discourage animal sacrifices, not for religious purposes, but for humane reasons.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: PTI) Improved fitness has made India a more athletic side that can sustain its energy till the last minute. (Source: PTI)Of all the adjectives youd generally use to describe the Indian hockey team, ridiculously quick and extremely fit arent the ones that would come to your mind. Skillful? Yes. Stylish? Most definitely. But speedy?This, after all, was a team that once, as per some accounts, guzzled a glass of lassi going into a match and gulped down a cup or two of ginger tea at half time. India were a respected opponent because of their skills. But their speed never worried their rivals, especially the Europeans or the Australians. It was easy for fitter rivals to wear down an unfit Indian team.On Saturday, though, this is how England under-21 coach Jon Blebby assessed the modern Indian team: India is fast, very attacking You cant play India their own game. So dont be ridiculously fast. They have some really fit players who can last. And there were times when we were caught playing India their style of hockey which doesnt suit us.Blebbys German counterpart Valentin Altenburg, also the coach of their senior team, corroborated his views. India is a very quick and athletic team. They are a fit team with outstanding individual players like Nilakanta (Sharma) and Mandeep (Singh). What impresses me is how they combine everything: they are quick, technically very strong but are also tactically very disciplined. So its becoming very difficult to beat them, Altenburg says.Indias breezy, free-flowing style combined with high levels of fitness and tactical awareness has changed the attitude of hockeys heavyweights towards them. Its a new, fit India. And its a result of five years of planned work. When David John first came to India as the physio in 2011, he had a one-point agenda: to raise the teams fitness to a level so that it can last full 70 minutes. Such was the state of their fitness that when the FIH made matches a 60-minute affair, many joked it would suit the Indians just well, taking a potshot at the teams inability to last the entire duration.John quickly put systems in place and restructured the players diet plans while then coach Michael Nobbs sacrificed tactics to make fitness as their sole area of focus. If you cant last the entire match, then theres no point of employing tactics, Nobbs once said.John replaced lassi with black coffee, the most significant change in the players drinking habits. Their food intake, water consumption, supplements and sleeping hours were closely monitored. Five years on, John returns to India as the countrys high performance director. He will be glad to see his ideas being implemented even with the junior side by the teams Australian scientific advisor Cody Tribe. One thing I noticed was the players, most of them from Punjab, consumed a lot of milk. So I cut down on it significantly. That was the biggest change in terms of habit, Tribe says.Food served to them is bland: dry, boiled and tandoori chicken is the staple for non-vegetarians while the six vegetarians in the team survive mainly on mushroom and salad. Raw fruits (uncut) are also included in their diet.Occasionally, they are allowed a small bite of sweets. But on days when there is no practice. When he introduced no sugar diktat the boys were hesitant. Through power point presentation we tried to educate them, it was a long process but they understood the importance, coach Harendra Singh says. Tribe adds, jokingly: If I had my way it would be no sweets, but sometimes the boys are a little bit sneaky.The impact of disciplined diet is visible on the field. In their 5-3 win over Saturday, each player covered an average distance of 8km. Against Canada in their opening match on Thursday, they ran for close to 9km each. The agility and alertness has reflected in improving the finer aspects of their game as well.On majority of the occasions when India lost possession against Canada, they snatched it back within four to six seconds. India won possession in Canadas half 17 times, thrice in the 25-yard circle, a consequence of the high-press style they have recently adopted, which at times puts so much pressure on the opposition that it forces turnover of possession. Against England, the turnover time was six to eight seconds. This has become the most significant aspect of the team as it helps them launch counterattacks at blinding pace, which even Blebby observed. However, because England are a much stronger opposition compared to Canada, India had to launch most of the counters from their half. England entered Indias half 38 times but on 11 occasions their attack was killed before they could enter the semicircle. It shows that the teams concentration level is high when defending. Concentration and fitness are inter-linked, Tribe says.Blebby says the best way to play this Indian side is by slowing down the game, passing the ball around and making them work hard to regain possession. Dont get caught dribbling the ball for far too long. Dont play quick, these Indian players are so fit theyll chase you down. You cant beat India at their own game, he said after the defeat. Quick and fit. The two new adjectives that define Indian hockey.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

As per the requirements of the people, a government college, a modern hospital, a sports stadium, a sugar mill and a museum for Christians will be constructed at Kalanaur,"" he said.In an attack on Amarinder, Kejriwal alleged that the Congress leader was again trying to ""befool"" the people of Punjab on the pretext of providing employment by filling up ""fake job cards"".Quoting the notification issued by Amarinder's government in the state in 2002, he alleged that right after taking charge in March, the former chief minister had held a cabinet meeting in April ""to ban recruitments in the state"".""Captain (Amarinder) was the one who started the contract system in government jobs in Punjab and passed orders to ban recruitment in government jobs. The old pension scheme was abolished by him during his 2002 tenure,"" alleged Kejriwal.He claimed that as per the Congress leader's promise of providing a government job to every family, the government would have to create 60 lakh new jobs. ""Does he have any plan for creation of new jobs?,"" he asked.Kejriwal said AAP has promised to give jobs to 25 lakh youths and claimed that it has a detailed plan for that. Saying old age pension, widow pension and handicapped pension will be raised to Rs 2,500 per month, he also promised to revive the old age pension scheme for government employees.The AAP leader assured the people that his party would get their money swallowed by chit fund companies back by impounding properties of those companies. He dubbed Amarinder's promise to curb the drug menace in state as ""fake"" alleging that it was the Congress leader who had opposed to a CBI inquiry against ""drug lord"" Majithia.""Whenever I talk about sending Majithia to jail, Captain Saab comes to fight with me. Both Sukhbir Singh Badal and Captain are challenging me to contest the election against them, but I will continue to fight against the mafia raj and drugs,"" said Kejriwal."

Just because people have been forced to return cash into the low cost current accounts and saving accounts (CASA), leading to a huge pile of deposits in the banks, does not mean the RBI can go around slashing interest rates even though its own estimates of lower Gross Domestic Product or Gross Value Addition, as it is now called, might have justified a rate cut. But then, as was pointed out in the latest credit policy statement, several key factors which could lead to inflation rising again, weighed on the decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to apply brakes on lowering the lending rates. The principal factors, as enumerated in the policy document, relate to risks emanating from the US interest rates trajectory and base advantage on inflation disappearing in the next few months.The RBI document has conceded that upturn in the prices of several items has been masked by the easing of inflation on base effects. In any case, prices of wheat, gram and sugar have been firming up, something the government can ill-afford ahead of Assembly elections in important states, including the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh. Insofar as a cautious stance on the rate cut is concerned, the RBI cannot be faulted; after all, it is a question of assessment and it is better for a central bank to be conservative despite conflicting pressures, even at times from the government.But one had wished the same sort of conservative approach and steadfastness was shown by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, who seems to have toed the line for scrapping the notes of high value from November 9. Both the RBI governor and the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley cannot just get away by saying the disruption to the economy and pain to people was factored in before announcement of demonetisation. Even if they had factored in the disruptions, the government and the RBI have gone terribly wrong in assessing the gravity of the situation which is evident in the lives of ordinary citizens. Central banks are not meant to be cheer leaders of the government in all cases; they must be watchdogs instead!"

BPL cardholders will be given coupons, which they may redeem at provision stores for foodgrain.The objective of the new exercise is to give the beneficiary the freedom of choice while buying foodgrain, curb pilferage and also give impetus to locally grown foodgrain, claimed Khader.The coupons may be collected from franchise centres. For a five-member family card, the cardholder will have the option of purchasing rations worth anywhere between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000. However, the coupon facility will be optional as the existing system of supplying subsidised foodgrain through ration shops will continue.Now, 5 kg of rice is issued to an individual beneficiary. One kg of rice costs Rs 27. A family also gets 1 kg of sugar (at Rs 20 a kg). In the open market, the prices are much higher.Undoing Anna Bhagya?Khader said the department requires 25 lakh metric tonne of rice to disburse under the Anna Bhagya scheme.

There is, however, no scarcity of edible salt.Wholesale traders have not been able to place orders for food grains due to scarcity of cash. The bulk supply of commodities such as rice, dal, jaggery and sugar to the market has been hit since the Union government demonetised 500- and 1,000-rupee notes last week, said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president, Bengaluru Wholesale Food Grains and Pulses Merchants Association.Wholesale traders largely depend on cash for transactions. Nearly half of the total transactions take place in cash and the rest on credit. Distributors demand upfront payments in cash when they get orders.This is because distributors have to pay farmers and transporters up front. They do not mind if the balance is paid by cheque, he said.According to Lahoti, the scarcity of liquidity has badly hit businesses. It seems there will be temporary scarcity of food grains in the open market in the coming days, he said. Its important to restore the cash flow at the earliest and help businesses stabilise.Contrary to rumours, there is no scarcity of edible salt. We have learnt that small traders in some towns in North Karnataka are hoarding salt. Thats mainly because of rumours in other parts of the country that there will be shortage of salt, said A K A Rajappa, a wholesale salt trader in Bengaluru. People need not worry. There is sufficient supply of edible salt and we dont see any problem in the coming days.Harsh Gupta, secretary, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department, said they were monitoring the situation and warned of action against hoarders of essential items.The state government procures salt in large quantity every month to supply it to BPL families under the public distribution system. There has been no problem in the supply. Scarcity is unlikely to arise as salt is produced throughout the year, he said."

591f15507be9e025a5d4a78a,"Water crisis: A tale of govt apathy, privilege",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/553992/water-crisis-tale-govt-apathy.html,2016-06-23,"Sonia Faleiro, June 24, 2016, INYT 23:40 ISTShort on empathy and responsibility, the Centre's neglect is rivalled only by its officials' flippancyWhen 2-year-old Rutuja playfully tipped over a bottle, spilling water onto the mud floor of the familys shack, her mother, Nageshwari Rathore, let loose a screech, lunging forward as though to slap the toddler. Rathore stopped herself, sinking her head into her hands. You finished it, she whispered.The loss wrenched at the 25-year-old. That June morning she had stood in line in the scorching heat for over an hour to collect five litres of water. A government tanker rolls up once a day to the abandoned field where she now lives.Located in Ghatkopar, a Mumbai suburb, the field functions as a relief camp for 350 families who have left their villages in rural Maharashtra because of a drought, the worst in 100 years. Wild pigs root through the open sewer that runs alongside the Rathores tarpaulin shack. When the monsoon arrives, possibly in the next few days, it will flood the camp and force the family out.Over 330 million Indians  about one quarter of the countrys population  have been affected by the drought. In Maharashtra, where over half the population is dependent on the rural economy, the effects are severe. An average of nearly nine farmers committed suicide every day last year, primarily over debt related to crop failure.Rural Indians are falling behind even as urban Indians enjoy unprecedented prosperity. And the tragedies that befall the poor benefit the more affluent. Forced to migrate to the cities, displaced farmers have little option but to join the enormous, unorganised labour force that serves the urban middle class as construction and domestic workers.Trees outside the field in Ghatkopar were festooned with political banners, suggesting that the camp was the creation of a benevolent government. In fact, politicians had to be prodded to visit, according to Abhishek Bharadwaj, a homeless-rights activist.It was only after the media reported the squalid living conditions at the camp that Kirit Somaiya, a member of the state Parliament, came around to distribute cash and grain. Somaiya then uploaded a YouTube video depicting the camp as having abundant food and supplies.Shau Chavan, who has been living in the camp for two months, said that government help had increased. In previous years, a local mafia had charged 1,000 rupees a month  about 2.5 days of the migrants daily wages  for a plot of 40 square feet. This year, Chavan said, the farmers are living rent-free, most likely as a result of government intervention.If this is what passes for official aid in the richest state of the fastest-growing major economy in the world, then Indias government is short on political will, not means. This years drought is extreme, but severe weather is a regular occurrence in India. The authorities had time to plan.The state governments relief measures look good on paper, Abhishek Waghmare, a policy analyst with the data website IndiaSpend, told me. The state has poured money into the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan, a water-conservation programme to make Maharashtra a drought-free state by 2019.But the villages Waghmare has visited over the past four years still lack basic rainwater collection systems. Government efforts to rejuvenate dormant rivers and ponds are ineffective: Year after year, Waghmare said, water runs off.Government failure stems from institutional disregard for the poor. Almost 70% of Indians live in rural areas, but the government doesnt appear to view them as essential to Indias march to modernise. The spiralling number of suicides suggests that farmers despair is not resonating with politicians.Even after eight states declared a drought last year, the Centre failed to increase support for two programmes created to act as lifesaving buffers: The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which promises every household 100 days of paid employment annually, and the Public Distribution System, which delivers subsidised grains and fuel to the needy.Government investment in the employment programme has decreased since 2014, the year the BJP came to power, and fewer jobs were created than before. Because of corruption in the food programme, rations earmarked for the poor are often sold on the black market instead.Self-sustainable initiativesMitigating the effects of a drought doesnt require much investment. The villagers of Hiware Bazar, in Maharashtras Ahmednagar district, havent required official drought assistance in over two decades.They banned borewells to prevent the water table from falling further and now cultivate vegetables instead of water-guzzling bananas and sugar cane. If the government had only shown similar initiative, the state wouldnt be in such dire need.In May, the Supreme Court scolded several state governments for their ostrich-like behaviour, and demanded the creation of a national disaster mitigation fund within three months. But nothing has happened yet, a principal adviser to the court said. The governments neglect is rivalled only by its officials flippant attitude.On April 15, Eknath Khadse, the revenue minister of Maharashtra at the time, visited the drought-stricken district of Latur. The water crisis was so severe then that a special train was commissioned to bring water to the area.But Khadse went by helicopter, even though Latur is readily accessible from Mumbai  which required the construction of a temporary helipad that consumed 10,000 litres of water.The next day, the water conservation minister, Pankaja Munde, showed up, and tweeted photographs of herself grinning in front of a parched riverbed.The drought selfies, as they came to be known, drew widespread condemnation. They captured perfectly the general reaction of Indias politicians to this disaster. Short on empathy and a sense of responsibility, our leaders see even grave crises only through the lens of their own privilege.International New York Times"

The export duty would deter traders from selling the sweetener in international markets where prices have increased due to delayed harvest of the crop in Brazil. India has exported 1.6 million tonnes of sugar in 2015-16.Senior government officials, led by Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande, are scheduled to visit Mozambique and Malawi in Africa to explore avenues to source pulses that are in short supply locally.Pande is also set to explore contract farming opportunities in other African countries, including Tanzania, and Myanmar."

An above average monsoon forecast is expected to help inflation trend lower in the coming months.Prices of pulses too moved moderately as the inflation print came in at 34.15% for pulses in March. The forecast of a normal monsoon in the central part of India is expected to help increase pulses production and ease inflation in pulses further as pulses are mainly produced in the central region. However, inflation in sugar and confectionery shot up at 3.92% in March from 0.51% in February.Industrial production grew at 2% in February, but worry lines appeared in manufacturing and capital goods production, which remained sluggish.While manufacturing grew at 0.7%, capital goods slowed at (-)9.8% in February. Mining recovered to grow at 5% and electricity at 9.6%, a touching distance from a double digit growth.After a continuous decline in industrial production for 3 months in a row, increase in IIP from (-)1.5% in January 2016 to 2% in February 2016, is encouraging, said PHD Chamber.The good performance of electricity, mining, basic and consumer durable goods in particular seems to have resulted in the favourable development, Assocham said.Ficci said, it was optimistic that reforms taken by the government would have a positive impact on manufacturing."

591f1c507be9e025a5d4ace2,Fighting rural India's diabetes spurt,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/553618/fighting-rural-indias-diabetes-spurt.html,2016-06-21,"Fighting rural India's diabetes spurtBy Dr Shaukat M Sadikot, Jun 22, 2016, 0:14 ISTWhen the fifth edition of the International Diabetes Federation Atlas came out in 2011, it had significant data and one fact stood out in particular. One person died of diabetes-related complications every seven seconds. The sixth edition which followed in 2013 showed that one person died of diabetes-related complications every six seconds!While this was alarming in itself, subsequent data continued to report an increase in these numbers. Recent studies and surveys have revealed that, in India the numbers have been grossly underreported, especially when it comes to rural India, since 67.63% of our people live in villages.The number of people in the country with diabetes is 72 million and about half of these do not know they have diabetes. Although most of these cases come from urban areas, the rural population has been found to make up 13% of this number. This translates to some 54 million people in rural India who suffer from diabetes!Moreover, we have found that more than 50% of the rural population remains undetected and unaware of their condition. They have no means to determine if their blood sugar levels fall within the normal range or if they are at a high risk of being diabetic.Urban residents have comparably higher awareness about the disease (58.4%) than rural residents (36.8%). A general lack of awareness about diabetes and its complications prevents a large section of the rural population from going for health check-ups.While access to screening and diagnostic amenities are slowly increasing in rural areas, facilities still remain significantly low when compared to urban areas. This acts as an impediment to catching diabetes early, when treatment interventions are most effective.When it comes to rural settings, it has been seen that maternal and pregnancy care is not very accessible or of the best quality. This may explain the birth of underweight babies, which predisposes them to insulin resistance and thereby increases the risk of diabetes in rural spaces.Gestational diabetes  diabetes which develops during pregnancy  is also a big cause for concern, both for the mother and baby. Thankfully, we have tests to detect it early between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.Early detection, regular check-ups and maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle can control and even reverse gestational diabetes, and facilities for the same should be made available to the farthest rural pockets in our country.Weapon of educationIt is abundantly clear that if we are to win the fight against diabetes, creating higher awareness and empowering the rural population with more knowledge about the disease must become our number one priority.Diabetes education is our we-apon and must become a central theme in this fight. We have to spread knowledge to the medical care givers, especially the primary care physicians, diab-etes educators and to the people with diabetes in the rural areas.The International Diabetes Federation has been working with the WHO, the UN and the Government in India to make diabetes a priority on the global political and development agenda and to develop actionable programmes to reach remote areas across the country.The treatment paradigms that we have developed for the management of diabetes in urban India need to be made available to the rural population. Collaborative initiatives and public-private partnerships appear to be viable routes to make this happen.Research and medical advances have given us a wide range of choices from oral drugs which stimulate insulin production to oral drugs that fight insulin resistance to injectable insulin which manages the more advanced stages of diabetes.Additionally, newer therapies are available today which can be used as and when required. Weight gain and hypoglycaemia are the two most frequently seen side effects of anti-diabetes medication which has made adherence difficult. With newer therapies, these become less of a concern.I am convinced that we will continue to make stellar pro-gress and, in time, may even find a cure for diabetes. However, none of this will matter if we cannot take such discoveries and make them available and accessible to patients in the remotest corners of our country. It is my hope that time will change this for the better and we will be able to collaboratively reach out to every single diabetic in India.(The writer is President Elect of the International Diabetes Federation-IDF)"

This, many expect, would create more room for interest rate cuts."

The Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas in its report submitted to Lok Sabha recently observed that 5% ethanol blending and subsequently higher blending in the future can significantly lower crude import. It can also provide new opportunities to sugarcane farmers.The committee observed that even after the government making 5% ethanol blending mandatory and fixing its price in November, last year, only 2% blending level has been achieved so far.It expressed concern that the availability of ethanol is not uniform across the country. It also observed that in sugarcane rich states such as Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, higher quantities of ethanol have been offered in comparison with the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, where no offers have been received.It also said that sole dependence on molasses-based ethanol can limit the implementation of programme and suggested the government set up industry group to look into feasibility of producing ethanol from variety of feed stocks.The committee demanded that the government give priority to ethanol for blending purposes, observing that state governments do not give priority to blending as they get more revenue from liquor sector which too consumes ethanol.It further suggested the government adopt the Brazil model, where the ethanol production is allowed directly from sugarcane juice and the output there is 14 times more than India. Sugar mills from India too have been demanding that production of ethanol may be allowed directly from sugar cane juice during the period of surplus production but the government allows ethanol production from molasses only."

It is in very advanced stage... It has been long standing demand, and is (under) an active consideration,"" Jaitley said.With regard to the rising Non-Performing Assets or bad loans, Jaitley said that besides strengthening the institutional mechanism, the government has been taking sector specific decisions to deal with the problems in segments like power, highways, sugar and steel.Giving details of the deliberations during the conclave, Jaitley said there are suggestions to amend SARFESI ACT and also expedite the DRT process by some more amendments to law.""The Department of Financial Services is working in that direction and work is in fairly advanced stage,"" he said, adding that DRT will become the country's first online court.""We are anxiously waiting for report of the Joint Committee on Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law. That will create a structural and institutional mechanism which will help the bank as lenders,"" the minister said.On the NPA situation in the banking sector, Jaitley said banks are taking steps to recovery bad loans.""As far as recovery is concerned, whatever steps have to be taken with regard to recovery banks have various rights for recovery through DRT, SDR... Neither loan waiver has been given to anyone, nor will be given,"" the minister said.In the current global environment, Jaitley said, banks have to take all the measures in order to clean up their books by effecting recoveries.He also said that there are some sector specific decisions which are required to be taken by the government. These include, power, highways, sugar and steel.To a question related to setting up of a 'bad bank', Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said the issues related to asset reconstruction companies and stressed assets were discussed."

At present, coal-based urea production technology for producing urea is common in South Africa, China and USA, among other countries.Currently, the government spends around Rs 45,000 crore as subsidy on urea per year. If the coal-based urea plant is set up in India, the cost of the urea prices may come down, said Nitin Gadkari.EthanolIn the proposed draft policy on second-generation ethanol manufacturing, the government dwelt on financial subsidy to industries to set up plants to generate advanced fuels.Second-generation biofuels, also known as advanced biofuels, can be produced by using biomass consisting of the residual non-food parts of crops such as stems, leaves and husks.First-generation biofuels are made from sugar and vegetable oils found in arable crops, which can be easily extracted using conventional technology.The government is planning ethanol blending in petrol to 22.5% and in diesel to 15%.Gadkari said boost to ethanol production could cut Indias huge crude oil imports bill, which is pegged at Rs 7 lakh crore per annum.Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan recently said public sector oil marketing firms will procure 120 crore litres of ethanol to reach the target of 5% blending for petrol by September 2016."

At present, we have 33 doctors and 1,000 patients, said Raghuraj S, Founder and CEO of HealthPlix. His personal experience made him start HealthPlix in October 2014.There are 68 million diabetics in India, and approximately 80% of these patients do not achieve their blood sugar and HbA1c goal, he said, adding that this means that India is faced with a burgeoning problem of diabetes mismanagement, which is the source of several serious health conditions.Improving patient experience in chronic diabetes care eases the burden of diabetes management, and for this, we have developed a platform that addresses the problem by covering both patients and their treating doctors, he said.Patients can enter their sugar levels and doctors would reply saying what should be done. Doctors could also see the complete history of the patient. Talking about expansion, Raghuraj said, We will be expanding soon to Pune, Hyderabad and Delhi. The startup is also mulling over including lifestyle management and diet in future.Our users age group varies between eight years and 71 years. In some cases, patients caretakers like parents or children use the app, he said, adding that they are looking to raise funds and will concentrate more on product enhancement and simplification."
591f2c327be9e025a5d4b836,Nuclear materials remain vulnerable to theft,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/537829/nuclear-materials-remain-vulnerable-theft.html,2016-03-31,"Nuclear materials remain vulnerable to theftDavid E Sanger and William J Broad, April 1, 2016, INYT 23:51 ISTPakistan's embrace of small, tactical nuclear weapons has altered the way the US talks of its nuclear securityAs President Barack Obama gathers world leaders in Washington this week for his last Nuclear Security Summit, tonnes of materials that terrorists could use to make small nuclear devices or dirty bombs remain deeply vulnerable to theft. Still, Obamas six-year effort to rid the world of loose nuclear material has pulled bomb-grade fuel out of countries from Ukraine to Chile.Perhaps more important, several countries are balking at safeguards promoted by the United States or are building new stockpiles. President Vladimir Putin of Russia, where some of the largest stockpiles of civilian nuclear material remain, has decided to boycott the summit. Putin has made it clear he will not engage in nuclear cleanup efforts dominated by the US.In addition, Pakistans embrace of a new generation of small, tactical nuclear weapons, which the Obama administration considers highly vulnerable to theft or misuse, has changed the way the administration talks about Pakistani nuclear security. While Obama declared early in his presidency that the United States believed Pakistans nuclear assets were secure, administration officials will no longer repeat that line.Instead, when the subject comes up, they note the modest progress Pakistan has made in training its guards and investing in sensors to detect break-ins. They refuse to discuss secret talks to persuade the Pakistanis not to deploy their new weapons. Pakistan, China, India and Japan are all planning new factories to obtain plutonium that will add to the worlds stockpiles of bomb fuel.And Belgium, where a nuclear facility was sabotaged in 2014 and where nuclear plant workers with inside access went off to fight for the Islamic State militant group, has emerged as a central worry. The country is so divided and disorganised that many fear it is vulnerable to an attack far more sophisticated than the bombings in the Brussels airport and subway system last week.For the first time, the Nuclear Security Summit will include a special session on responding to urban terrorist attacks  and a simulation of how to handle the threat of imminent nuclear terrorism. The key question for this summit, said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard and a former White House science adviser, is whether theyll agree on approaches to keep the improvements coming.The nuclear initiative has been a signature issue for Obama: It is among the goals he camp-aigned on in 2008 and one reason he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize barely a year into his presidency. Benjamin Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told reporters on Tuesday that the administrations overall efforts had made it harder than ever before for terrorists and bad actors to acquire nuclear material.But the administrations budget for aiding global nuclear cleanups has been cut by half; some officials argue that less funding is needed with fewer nations willing to give up nuclear materials. A report Bunn helped write noted, The administration is now projecting lower spending year after year for years to come, postponing or canceling a wide range of nuclear security activities that had been included in previous plans.In a recent report, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a private advocacy group in Washington that tracks nuclear weapons and materials, warned that many radioactive sources were poorly secured and vulnerable to theft. The report called the probability of a terrorists detonating a dirty bomb much higher than that of an improvised nuclear device.Ingredients for so-called dirty bombs, which use conventional explosives to spew radioactive material, are still scattered around the globe at thousands of hospitals and other sites that use the highly radioactive substances for industrial imaging and medical treatments. Fewer than half of the countries that attended the last nuclear summit in 2014 pledged to secure such materials, and they in turn represent less than 15% of the 168 nations belonging to the International Atomic Energy Agency.And while the administration succeeded in getting more than a dozen countries to give up their civilian stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a main fuel of atomic bombs, the Nuclear Threat Initiative said in another report that some 25 nations still had such materials  enough for thousands of nuclear weapons.The report called highly enriched uranium one of the most dangerous materials on the planet, warning that an amount small enough to fit in a 5-pound bag of sugar could be used to build a nuclear device with the potential to kill hundreds of thousands of people.Still, that does not mean Obamas efforts have failed altogether. He is expected to announce a major achievement soon: the removal of roughly 40 bombs worth of highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium from Japan. Some of the uranium was fabricated in pieces the size of squares of chocolate that could be easily slipped into a pocket, a terrorists dream. Yet there are signs that what began as a global effort to prevent terrorists from obtaining the worlds deadliest weapons is fracturing.In fact, there is a case to be made that even as vulnerable stockpiles have shrunk, the risk of nuclear terrorism has not. There is evidence that groups like the Islamic State are more interested than ever in nuclear plants, materials and personnel  especially in Belgium, where the attacks last week killed more than 30 people. The Belgian police discovered last year that Islamic State operatives had taken hours of surveillance video at the home of a senior official at a large nuclear site in Mol, Belgium. The plant in Mol, a northern resort area, holds large stocks of highly enriched uranium.Atomic terrorismLaura Holgate, Obamas top adviser on nuclear terrorism, noted on Tuesday that the US had worked with Belgium to reduce the amount of nuclear material at one key site. Asked about the Islamic States interest in obtaining nuclear fuel from Belgium, she said, We dont have any information that a broader plot exists.The results of previous summit meetings have ranged from treaty ratifications to the establishment of more than a dozen training centres around the globe where guards, scientists, managers and regulators sharpen their skills at preventing atomic terrorism. Near Beijing, one of the largest training centres opened this month. Its in our national interest to help foreigners secure their atomic materials, said Nick Winowich, an engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, one of the American nuclear labs that helped in the centres development.The biggest wins have been the removal of all highly enriched uranium from 12 countries, including Austria, Chile, Hungary, Libya, Mexico, Turkey and Vietnam. The material was mo-stly reactor fuel. But officials said terrorists cou-ld have turned it into least 130 nuclear weapons.Critics of the summit process point to vague communiqus that seem to have done little to drive hard decisions. A sense of summit fatigue now seems to prevail, the critics add, noting that Russias withdrawal evades some of the worlds biggest security problems.The Obama administration has also presided over a steady drop in US spending on international nuclear security. Budgets fell from more than $800 million in 2012 to just over $500 million in 2016. For 2017, the White House has proposed less than $400 million  half the spending of the high point. The administration has defended the cuts, saying they reflect the completion of some programmes and upgrades and suspension of cooperative work with Russia after its invasion of the Crimean Peninsula.International New York Times"
591f34457be9e025a5d4bdb1,Intermittent fasting  diets gain acceptance,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/534522/intermittent-fasting-diets-gain-acceptance.html,2016-03-15,"Intermittent fasting diets gain acceptanceStudies show that 2 to 5 days of fasting each month reduce biomarkers for diabetes, cancer, heart diseaseMark Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Ageing in Maryland, has not had breakfast in 35 years. Most days he practices a form of fasting  skipping lunch, taking a midafternoon run, and then eating all of his daily calories (about 2,000) in a six-hour window starting in the afternoon.Once you get used to it, its not a big deal, said Mattson, chief of the institutes laboratory of neurosciences. Im not hungry at all in the morning, and this is other peoples experience too. Its just a matter of getting adapted to it.In a culture in which its customary to eat three large meals a day while snacking from morning to midnight, the idea of regularly skipping meals may sound extreme. But in recent years intermittent fasting has been gaining popular attention and scientific endorsement.It has been promoted in best-selling books and endorsed by celebrities like the actors Hugh Jackman and Benedict Cumberbatch. The late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel claims that for the past two years he has followed an intermittent fasting programme known as the 5:2 diet, which entails normal eating for five days and fasting for two  a practice Kimmel credits for his significant weight loss.Fasting to improve health dates back thousands of years, with Hippocrates and Plato among its earliest proponents. Mattson argues that humans are well suited for it: For much of human history, sporadic access to food was likely the norm, especially for hunter-gatherers.As a result, weve evolved with livers and muscles that store quickly accessible carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, and our fat tissue holds long-lasting energy reserves that can sustain the body for weeks when food is not available. From an evolutionary perspective, its pretty clear that our ancestors did not eat three meals a day plus snacks, Mattson said.Across the world, millions of people fast periodically for religious and spiritual reasons. But some are now looking at the practice as a source of health and longevity.Valter Longo, the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, initially studied fasting in mice and found that two to five days of fasting each month reduced biomarkers for diabetes, cancer and heart disease. That research has since been expanded to people, and scientists have been a similar reduction in disease risk factors.Longo said the health benefits of fasting might result from the fact that fasting lowers insulin and another hormone called insulinlike growth factor, or IGF-1, which is linked to cancer and diabetes. Lowering these hormones may slow cell growth and development, which in turn helps slow the ageing process and reduces risk factors for disease.When you have low insulin and low IGF-1, the body goes into a state of maintenance, a state of standby, Longo said. There is not a lot of push for cells to grow, and in general the cells enter a protected mode.Critics say that health benefits or not, various forms of intermittent fasting are too impractical for most people.The 5:2 diet, for example, advocates eating without restrictions for five days and then consuming just 500 calories  roughly the equivalent of a light meal  on each of the other two days of the week. Another regimen, called alternate-day fasting, involves eating no more than 500 calories every other day.A third regimen, which Mattson follows, is known as time-restricted feeding. The idea is to consume all of the days calories in a narrow window, typically six to eight hours, and fasting for the remaining 16 to 18 hours in a day. Studies of time-restricted feeding practices in both animals and humans have suggested that the practice may lower cancer risk and help people maintain their weight.The scientific community remains divided about the value of intermittent fasting. Critics say that the science is not yet strong enough to justify widespread recommendations for fasting as a way to lose weight or boost health, and that mo-st of the evidence supporting it comes from animal research. Advocates say the body of research on intermittent fasting is growing rapidly and indicates that health benefits are striking.The 5:2 diet, in particular, is backed by promising studies that show that it lowers weight and improves blood sugar, inflammation and other aspects of metabolic health, said Joy Dubost, a registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, largest organisation of dietitians in US.Most people who do this understand that its not about binge eating, Dubost said. But they like that it gives them the freedom not to worry about calories, carbs and other restrictions on days when theyre not fasting.Beneficial programmeIn 2011, Mattson and his colleagues reported a study of the 5:2 programme that followed 107 overweight and obese women. Half of the subjects were assigned to eat no more than 500 calories each on two consecutive days each week. A control group was assigned to follow a low-calorie diet. After six months, both groups had lost weight. But the intermittent fasting group lost slightly more  about 14 pounds on average  and had greater reductions in belly fat. They also retained more muscle and had greater improvements in blood sugar regulation.Mattsons interest in intermittent fasting grew out of work on animals that showed that alternate-day fasting protected mice from strokes, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, and consistently extended their life spans by 30%.He found that alternate-day fasting increased the production of proteins that protect brain cells, enhancing their ability to repair damaged DNA. Fasting, he said, acts as a mild stress that makes cells throughout the body stronger, shoring up their ability to adapt to later insults.Mattson is now starting a rigorous clinical trial of people 55 to 70 years old who are prediabetic and at high risk for developing Alzheimers disease. He plans to study whether intermittent fasting may slow cognitive decline.Dr David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, said one benefit of fasting is that it forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to using fat. During this process, the fat is converted to compounds known as ketones, a clean energy source that burns more efficiently than glucose, like high-octane gasoline, Ludwig said.The same process, known as ketosis, occurs when people go on extremely low-carb, high-fat diets. Ludwig said ketones seem to have unique effects on the brain. There are extensive reports of children who had debilitating seizures who were cured on ketogenic diets, Ludwig said. If it benefits the brain to prevent seizures, then maybe it benefits the brain in other ways.Ludwig noted that the long-term effectiveness of fasting had not been well studied. He cautioned that for many people, fasting is simply too difficult and may slow metabolism.A potentially more practical approach is to limit sugar and other processed carbohydrates, replacing them with natural fats, protein and unrefined carbohydrates, he said.It takes a very disciplined person to skip a couple meals every day, he added.International New York Times"

These 150 units were among the 764 industries that were identified as the major culprits of industrial pollution in the Ganga river.These industries were asked last year to adhere to new standards, connect themselves to common effluent treatment plants, bring down their water usage, and install real-time effluent discharge monitoring system that could be tracked from a central control room.Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar Wednesday said barring these 150 units all the others had adopted the new standards or were in the process of doing so. He said the steps being taken by the units had started showing remarkable results.He said industrial pollution in Ganga had come down by about a third. The total wastewater generation from these industries had been reduced by 125 million litres per day, while the biochemical oxygen demand, a key indicator of organic pollutants in rivers, was likely to come down by 30 tonnes after the closure of the 150 units.Javadekar said the closed industrial units can be allowed to resume operations if they take all the actions required of them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Even though trade routes and harbours played a pivotal role in the beginning, when industrialisation was norm of the day, the Second World War really promoted industrial development supported by discriminating protection which flourished cotton textiles, sugar and iron and steel industries.As India also grew with the global industrial revolution, which already finished three phases, getting onto fourth wave, the country is gearing up to be a part of it by focussing on infrastructure-supported industrialisation, which is reflected in the emergence of industrial corridors, where various nodes and industrial hubs, and smart cities are planned. The UPA governments National Strategy for Manufacturing prepared in 2006 and the current NDA governments Make in India campaign support corridors. India started its journey on industrial corridors with the establishment of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) in 2005. It enhanced the industrialisation process between two cities, and various nodes were also established for further development of towns. Besides private city Lavasa near Pune and 24 new cities, the 1,500 km-long DMIC goes along with the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor.So what exactly is an industrial corridor? Besides allocating a package of infrastructure spending to a specific geographical area, industrial corridors help in flourishing industrial development by creating manufacturing clusters and ancillary industries. Besides smart cities, these corridors will be well-connected by road, rail, air or sea.Interacting with Deccan Herald, Grant Thornton India Partner Vikram Bapat said industrial corridors will help in the next wave of industrialisation, as they will ring-fence fertile agricultural land for industrial use, and thus benefit both sectors. By enabling the growth of ancillary units, these industrial corridors will reduce freight and transportation costs. Once GST is rolled out, it will rationalise the supply chain and bring in optimal tax structure, he said. Bapat also pointed out that the industrial corridors will help attract talent in large numbers and achieve 100 million job target easily.Manufacturing-led industrialisationManufacturing is the keg pin of industrialisation as the society is moving towards massive consumerism supported by growing disposable income. India imported $300 billion of capital and consumer goods last year, and if 80 per cent of it is produced from India, it will create massive job opportunities and investment. The corridors will become catalysts in this journey.Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Nirmala Sitharaman said Indias manufacturing sectors contribution to GDP is only 17 per cent and the government plans to take it 25 per cent in the current year. Cisco India & SAARC Sales MD Purushottam Kaushik said, The industrial corridors planned by the government will not only link smart cities, but will also be the main driver of the pledge to Make In India by ensuring seamless connectivity for industrial growth.Chandan Mitra, who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce, and entrusted with the task of preparing a report for expediting projects, told Deccan Herald that the industrial corridor will lure investment and accentuate industrialisation of India. The industrial corridors are coming up along with the freight corridors, which will also connect ports, and will help in the transportation of capital goods, he said. Besides land acquisition and infrastructure development, the panel will look into all issues concerning the corridors financial aspects.Policy frameworkIndias first industrial corridor DMIC got Rs 17,500 crore grant from the Centre and $4.5 billion from the Japanese government for the first phase, which started in 2011. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) holds a 26 per cent stake in DMICDC. But the institutional framework for the formation of node/city-level SPVs for corridors are yet to come up.According to Bapat, there is a need for a separate strategy to incentivise corridor projects to bring in more investment . One idea could be to institutionalise the corridors and create single-window agencies that can cut through inter-state issues and help businesses to set up seamlessly, he said. On the role of central and state governments, he said the model for administering corridors should be like that of National Highways.Rumours are rife that the government plans to approve a proposal to establish a National Industrial Corridor Authority (NICA) for implementing corridor projects in the current Budget.Corridors plannedBesides DMIC, the government plans the development of Amritsar-Kolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC), Bengaluru- Mumbai Economic Corridor (BMEC), Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC), Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) and Chennai-Kolkata Industrial Corridor. DMIC is one of the worlds largest infrastructure projects and is expected to fetch $90 billion investment. Six states, namely, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, have formed SPVs for the development of DMICs nodes.DMIC Chief Executive Alkesh K Sharma said that they are in the final stages of completing the pre-PPP process, which includes forming SPVs and creating the basic infrastructure like transportation, water treatment, sewage treatment, among others. This work will be completed in the next 4-5 months and by August, we feel we will be able to invite anchor investors to set up their businesses there, he said. In the North East, the government mulls a similar mega infrastructure project  requiring a basic investment of Rs 11,000 crore (not including land and power)  which will link the states of the region with each other and to multiple border points.Multilateral agencies like Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), JBIC (which are supporting DMIC and CBIC) and the Asian Development Bank (which has completed a conceptual development plan for VCIC) have evinced interest in investing these projects. On the CBIC, the nodal agency JICA has completed the master plan, and three nodes have been identified. ADB has completed a conceptual development plan report on VCIC and two nodes have been identified for master planning. The AKIC feasibility study is under progress.OpportunitiesCiscos Kaushik said the Make In India and industrial corridor projects hold tremendous value for the company. The latest report from Sustainability Outlook pegs the smart city market in India at $45-$50 billion over the next five years. We are working with the government on information and communication technology for the smart cities proposed under the DMIC. These include Dholera Special Investment Region in Gujarat, Shendra-Bidkin Mega Industrial Park in Maharashtra, Manesar Bawal Investment Region in Haryana and Khushkhera Bhiwadi Neemrana Investment Region in Rajasthan, he said.Indo-German Chamber of Commerce Director General Bernhard Steinruecke said that German companies are not looking at large investment in the corridor but only parts of that. We have been looking at Mumbai-Bengaluru corridor and looking at its feasibility study. I came to know that there is a competition between the UK and Germany in this project, he said.Scope for IndustrialisationIndia imported $300 billion of capital and consumer goods last year, and if 80 per cent of it is produced from India, it will create massive job opportunities and investment. The corridors will become catalyst in this journey.But to make the corridors successful, we have to be part of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, which will be shaped by a fresh wave of innovation in areas such as smart robotics, materials that are lighter and tougher, and a manufacturing process built around 3D printing and analytics.Here we have to come up with new technologies, new products, new brands and enter new markets so that Make in India will become a grand success. Even though we have entrepreneurs who have performed well, we need strategic alliances with countries like the US, Britain, Germany, Japan, Korea and Taiwan to emulate and correct ourselves to go ahead.DIPP secretary Amitabh Kant said, Industrial corridors will help in many layers of manufacturing, from Industry 4.0 to labour intensive manufacturing, which will bring largescale investment, employment opportunity, productivity gains, said Kant.Massive investment in industrial corridor will pave the way for large human displacement and destruction of fertile agricultural land. According to economist Joseph Schumpeters Creative Destruction Theory, an entrepreneurs introduction of radical innovation into the system will bring in creative destruction of economic value and it will really force sustained long-term economic growth. Let us believe Schumpeter and industrial corridors will help Indias efforts to lead the world in the fourth wave of industrial revolution."

Swaying to the rhythm of drums, hundreds of dancers kept the night warm even when the weather turned hostile, as Rio handed over the baton to Tokyo, the hosts of the next edition in 2020.We arrived in Brazil as guests. Tonight we depart as your friends. You will have a place in our hearts forever, said International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach, congratulating Brazil on organising the Games in tough times. In recognition of Rios efforts, Bach presented the Olympic Cup to Cariocas, the residents of the city, with six of its representatives receiving the prize.Declaring the Games closed, Bach called upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in Tokyo to celebrate the next edition of the sporting festival. As the Olympic flame was extinguished, the Olympic flag was lowered and handed over to Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike.Human formations of Sugar Loaf mountain and the Olympic rings had earlier paved the way to a wonderful world of music and dance as Brazils art held centre stage.In tune with the Olympic tradition, athletes then marched in together, with flag-bearers having made their entry first. Sakshi Malik, the wrestler who broke Indias duck at these Games with a bronze medal, carried the Tricolour.Super MarioTokyos brief presentation, marked by high-tech graphics, drew loud cheers when Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe emerged from a pipe in the middle of the field, dressed as the video game character Super Mario.

591f883c7be9e025a5d4f583,Change cropping pattern,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/570211/change-cropping-pattern.html,2016-09-13,"Change cropping patternBy R G Subramanyam, Sep 14, 2016, DHNS: 21:47 ISTEvery third or the fourth year, river Cauvery, the lifeline of both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, embitters the harmonious relationship existing between the two southern states. The Cauvery river dispute is more than a century old but a lasting solution is eluding.Out of the riparian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry, the first two are major players. When the river supplies are copious, there is obviously no dispute. It is only when the river supplies are low that the two states literally go to war. One can examine some basic facts about the river, its water potential, the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunals (CWDT) award and measures that could be taken to minimise or mitigate the distress in the bad years.General: About 42% of the Cauvery basin area lies in Karnataka, 54% in TN and the rest 4% in Kerala and Puducherry. In a normal year, the contribution of Karnataka and TN to the river system is 53% and 30%, respectively. In an average year, the total flow in the river is 730 TMCft (Thousand Million Cubic Feet).The CWDT allocated in 2007 a quantity of 270 TMCft (37%) to Karnataka, 419 TMcft (54%) to TN and the remaining 66 TMCft (9%) to Kerala and Puducherry.Karnataka felt aggrieved that though its contribution to the river flows was much higher than that of TN, its allocation was less than what it should get. The Tribunal also stipulated that Karnataka should release annually 192 TMCft to TN as per the monthly schedule drawn by it. It did not spell out clearly what should be the quantum of releases in bad years. There exist four major dams in Karnataka Krishna Raja Sagar, Kabini, Harangi and Hemavathi - with an aggregate gross storage capacity of 114.37 TMCft. Tamil Nadu has three big dams - Mettur, Bhavanisagar and Periyar - with an aggregate storage capacity of 136.54 TMCft.Demand: The reservoirs on the Cauvery river and its tributaries are designed to meet the irrigation needs of all the four states, generate some hydro power and meet the drinking water requirements of Bengaluru, Mysuru and many other smaller towns and villages. The farmers in TN and Karnataka grow principally rice and sugar cane. These are water-intensive crops. The area between Mandya and Srirangapatna is a sugar belt. Lush green paddy fields on either side of the National Highway between Bengaluru and Mysuru greet the visitor. Tamil Nadu raises three rice crops in a year.I suggest some measures which, if implemented, would ensure lowering of water demand and also making the riparian states less dependent on the river supplies.(1) Crop Pattern: Both Karnataka and TN at present grow water-guzzling crops like sugar cane and rice. Sugar cane is a perennial crop, which requires 3,000 mm of water all through the year. Rice requires 1,200-1,500 mm of water. In drier years, it becomes extremely difficult to meet the huge demand of both the states. The solution that suggests itself is to curtail the demand by way of replacing high water-intensive crops by light crops. Millets, oilseeds, pulses, ragi etc should replace sugar cane and rice cultivation. Unfortunately, India has still not developed a reliable weather forecasting system.If there were such a reliable system, the farmers would have a choice at the beginning of the sowing season itself to sow the particular type of crop depending upon the supply position. Till such time a reliable forecasting system is developed, it would be a gamble to grow water-intensive crops. The farmers should be educated about the wisdom in going in for light crops. The field workers of the agricultural department should do this. The TN government should dissuade its farmers from raising more than one rice crop.(2) Water-saving measures: Many farmers are under the mistaken impression that more is better. Application of more water affects the yield, spoils health of the soil and also results in wastage of precious water. Water should be applied by drip/sprinkler irrigation. Irrigation water should be charged on volumetric basis. The water conveyance system, right up to the field level, should be lined to minimise transmission losses.(3) Conjunctive use: The subsoil water levels in irrigated areas are always high. Bore/dug wells should be provided in the irrigated areas so that underground water supplements the canal supplies. This would lessen dependence on irrigation water, help prevent water logging and the consequent deterioration in the health of the soil.(4) Drinking Water issues: Bengaluru, Mysuru and other small towns, having a total population of 13 million, depend on Cauvery water. The requirement in a full year is as much as 23 TMCft. There is what is called water illiteracy among the users. A campaign should be launched to educate the users to conserve water. A good amount of water is lost due to the leakages in the distribution system. The Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board as also other municipalities should plug the leakages and replace the old and rusted pipelines.Unauthorised pipe connections should be detected and penal action taken against the offenders. Rain water harvesting (RWH) should be made mandatory so that precious rainwater is not allowed to flow to the gutters. Determined efforts should be made to raise the depleting water table levels by recharging with RWH. Installation of sewage water treatment plants should be made mandatory. A number of lakes have vanished in the city, thanks to the real estate lobby. These lakes should be revived which will help ease the water problem to some extent.A national policy to deal with inter-state river disputes should be drawn. The Centre should lay down broad principles for sharing water amongst the riparian states in years of distress.(The writer is former Chief Engineer, and Irrigation and Command Area Development Commissioner, Govt of Gujarat)"

What we want is to protect the identity of our Rasogolla. Their product is different from ours both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing,"" an official told PTI.In a recent letter to the Geographical Indications Registry office in Chennai, the state department of food processing industries and horticulture said the way the dessert is made in the state is different from that of other states.""The preparation of light sugar syrup is unique and it contributes towards the taste of Rasogolla. Light syrup adds to the unique mouth-fill characteristic which is traditional in nature and well documented in different books unlike other similar products,"" the letter said, adding the quality of the dessert from West Bengal is unique.Even during its original application before the Intellectual Property office last year, the state government had sought the GI tag on what they call it as ""Banglar Rasogolla"" (Bengal's Rasgulla).""For example we have Darjeeling Tea and Himachal has Kangra Tea. Both are tea but the taste is different. Both can have GI tags,"" officials said.Odisha has claimed that the sweetmeat originated from the Jagannath Temple in Puri, where it is a part of the religious rituals since the 12th century. Odisha calls it 'Pahala Rasgulla'.In West Bengal, confectioner Nobin Chandra Das is widely known as the one, who created Rasgulla in the 1860s.Bengal has told the GI registrar office that the one in Odisha is a different variety.The Bengal one is off white or light cream coloured, spherical in shape while in other states, it varies from brown to other colours.""The concentration of sugar syrup is light while in Odisha it is highly concentrated. When taken in mouth, their Rasgulla is chewy and sticky unlike ours. The texture is also different. Ours is soft and foam type while theirs is hard and sticky,"" officials said.The geographical indication (GI) of goods acts as the ""claim to fame"" for a state. It identifies a product as originating from a particular location and conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness that is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin.Once granted, the GI tag prevents unauthorised use of the geographical indication and boosts exports by giving it a unique identity.'Rasogolla', a dessert, made from ball shaped dumplings of Indian cottage cheese i.e ""channa"", is cooked in light syrup which is made of sugar.Officials said the sponge characteristics of the sweetmeat is linked with the human skill of sweet makers of Bengal.""People all over India and even outside the country know Bengal Rasogolla. It is very famous. We have around one lakh sweet makers all over the state involved in making it. Not only does our Rasogolla go outside the state but we also export it,"" they said."

They also suggested reduction of the calorie content of these beverages to no more than 40 calories per 355 ml bottle.The letters were sent to the chief executive officers of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo as well as to the companies major institutional investors in the run-up to Coca-Colas annual meeting on April 27 and PepsiCos on May 4.While sugar-drink consumption in the US and Europe has been declining, your company and others are investing billions of dollars annually to increase sales in low and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, says the letter.The signatories are George Institute for Global Health from Australia and India; Alliance for the Control of Tobacco Use and Health Promotion, Brazil; The Nutritional Health Alliance, Mexico; Australia and New Zealand Obesity Society from Australia; Centre for Science and Environment, India, World Obesity Federation and World Public Health Nutrition Association.Around two lakh deaths occur every year due to sugar related diseases. The negative impact of sugar is a critical area to be worked upon, said Vivekananda Jha, executive director of George Institute for Global Health, India.Studies carried out by the Diabetes Foundation and Centre of Nutrition and Metabolic Research suggest per capita consumption of sugary beverages has gone up by over five times in India since 1998, demonstrating the impact of the marketing undertaken by these companies in India.Excess sugar in the body causes multiple disorders and eventually leads to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, among other diseases.Sin taxWhile several Indian public health specialists suggested a sin tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, a committee on the Goods and Services Tax headed by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian proposed 40% tax on aerated drinks  a move that was opposed by cola companies.In February, non-governmental organisation Centre for Science in the Public Interest released a report exposing how Coke and Pepsi are spending billions in Brazil, China, India, and Mexico to promote sugar-drink sales."

The same tea will now give you a kick, thanks to a bunch of scientists who made a wine from the brew.Rich in health boosting chemicals, the tea-wine has been created by a Himalayan laboratory that is set to transfer the technology to a firm in Mozambique. Two Indian units in Pune and Hamirpur are interested too.The brown coloured wine is made from tea dust, yeast, sugar and four varieties of fruit, including a Himachal fruit named Kafal and a type of yellow berries. Its alcohol content is 10-13%The tea-based wine has the potential to compete with the red wine as both are rich in anti-oxidants, which protect the body from cell damage. It contains an anti-oxidant component known as Catechin, which helps remove dangerous free radicals from the body. Green tea is considered beneficial to health because of the its high Catechin content.We are going to compete with high-end wines. As the global market of organic wine is worth several billions of dollars, we intend to pitch in with our product, Sanjay Kumar, director of the CSIR Institute of Himalayan Bioresources Technology (IHBT), Palampur told DH.At the IHBT laboratory, four varieties of these wine are available. The most popular one has been named Kargil Sepoy after it was found popular with the armed forces during a three year trial.Incidentally, one of the Kargil war heroes Captain Saurabh Kalia, who was captured and killed by the Pakistan, hails from this Himachal town.Though the tea-based wine was developed several years ago, sources said Indian wine industry was not interested because of inherent complexities in the Indian excise rules as the raw material is a new crop. But a fresh push on commercialisation has now come from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research headquarters after the CSIR was asked by the government to earn more revenue.Scientists took up the tea-wine project more than a decade ago when the Kangra valley tea sector faced a major economic crisis. The underlying aim was to create more value added products from tea to boost the local economy."
591fba827be9e025a5d51795,"FM hits back at Rahul, says NDA has brought down inflation",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560718/fm-hits-back-rahul-says.html,2016-07-28,"New Delhi, Jul 28, 2016, PTI 20:16 ISTHitting back at Rahul Gandhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today reeled out statistics in Lok Sabha to assert that the NDA government had brought down inflation and expressed hope that prices of essential commodites will come down further after a ""good"" monsoon.After Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that the government had failed to control prices, particularly of the essential commodities, Jaitley contended that the NDA government had inherited high inflation from the UPA dispensation.""Any form of bluster is not substitute of statistics,"" he told the Congress Vice President while intervening in a debate on price rise and asked him to compare the status of inflation during the UPA government and that prevailing now.Referring to Gandhi's attack on Modi for criticising the then Congress-led government over inflation in February 2014, Jaitley said, ""This is a topic of statistics and not sloganeering. The UPA had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if I come to power, I will try to bring inflation down. No one should have any objection to that.""Insisting that the Modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Finance Minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon.He acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply.Noting that India has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes.The output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, Jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the Food Ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control.He also criticised Gandhi for asking the Prime Minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates.The government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and India is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said.""You are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts,"" Jaitley said.Jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked Rahul Gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought.""Even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of UPAs and not NDA... We have contained inflation despite having two years of drought. Good monsoon helps economy and with good monsoon this year, I expect that the prices of will come down,"" Jaitley said.He said the UPA had left the economy in a dire state, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation at double digit, WPI inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited.He cautioned UPA against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"".Taking a jibe at Gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this House seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"".He said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of UPA regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim.The NDA government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative WPI inflation, the Finance Minister said.Giving reply to members' concerns on how the government has utilised the gains on account of drop in crude oil prices, Jaitley said the gains have been utilised in three ways -- to help oil PSUs to reduce their losses on account of subsidy, to invest in infrastructure and benefit common people by enabling them to shell out less money in buying petroleum products.He said 42 per cent of the gains due to fall in global crude oil prices is shared with the states with the Centre retaining 58 per cent of the share.""It is because of these policies to shore up public investment that for two years in a row that India has emerged as the fastest growing economy. It is mainly because of public inbvestment and foreign investment that we are growing at a respectable rate, but we are not satisfied as we have greater potential,"" Jaitley said.""When the going is good, economies grow, but it is only when the going is challenging then the real challenge arises,"" he said.Countering Gandhi's remark that the UPA government had waived off farm loans, Jaitley said the NDA government's policies are not one-time and are instead more sustainable towards building rural infrastructure, irrigation facility and sanitation for upliftment of poor.""All these steps taken by the government will propel India to better economy,"" he said.Jaitley said July is the month when, due to seasonal factors, food inflation usually sees an upward trend and after the new crop comes, prices would fall.Terming as ""new economic equation"" Gandhi's remarks that prices of pulses should come down when MSPs are hiked, Jaitley said inflation is a matter of demand-supply mismatch.""This equation I have heard for the first time. The situation is that MSP of pulses is raised but production did not increase and there was two consecutive years of rainfall shortage,"" he said, adding this year rain Gods have been kind enough.He said there is demand for 23 MT of pulses this year while the output is 17 MT. The remaining 6 MT would be procured from Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania.The acreage data for the new crop year shows that the output will go up to 20 million tonnes and the government is working towards increasing the buffer stock to 20 lakh tonnes.With regard to sugar prices, Jaitley said the current price is reeling around Rs 33-34/kg and the government is working to lower it by Rs 1-2/ kg to ensure right price to consumers and better returns to farmers.He said sugar price had come down to Rs 22-23/kg and farmers were not able to get their cost back and sugar mills were on the verge of closing down. The total dues of farmers from mills have been brought down from Rs 27,000 crore to Rs 1,800 crore.When prices started going up to Rs 40 per kg, the government brought in export restriction and that cooled prices, the Finance Minister said.As regards onion prices, Jaitley said prices were lower till 3-4 months back and the Centre had to purchase 20,000 tonnes extra produce from farmers.Tomato prices, he assured, will come down after the monsoon season.Jaitley said the UPA government policies had led to a situation where global publications were talking about policy paralysis and exit of 'I' from BRICS grouping.""Private investment was weak, the state of economy was such that banking system's ability to support growth had come down,"" he said, adding that back of envelop calculations not necessarily forms part of good economic policies.Defending the move to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel when global crude oil prices were falling, Jaitley said at a time when global growth was witnessing slowdown and banks had limited capacity to lend, the government had no other option than to garner as much resources as possible to stabilise the economy.When oil prices slumped in the second half of 2014 and 2015, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel nine times to mop up additional revenues that helped it meet ts revenue and fiscal deficit targets. In all, it raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre.Participating in the debate, Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government's economic policies are based on two parameters-- windfall from crude prices and cess pool.He said the Finance Minister failed to provide a clear roadmap as to how it plans to bring down prices and instead he pinned his hope on good monsoon. He wanted to know why the government acts only after the prices have moved up.He said the Prime Minister, who had been meeting world leaders including US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not hold a single meeting on price rise.Hukmdev Narayan Yadav (BJP) said the opposition is frustrated with the government as it is taking several steps to bring back black money and hence they are trying to raise the matter of price rise in the House.B Mahtab (BJD) said both the Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA have failed to tame the demon of inflation.""Prise rise is symptom and inflation is disease"", he said, adding unless the government deals with inflation it would not be possible to contain inflation.Mahtab added that the government should deal with the supply side issues to contain inflation which has been adversely affecting the large section of population.Apparently referring to RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, he said the person who has been trying to deal with inflation is now going back to Chicago because someone in the ruling dispensation has asserted that he was not a nationalist.Tariq Anwar (NCP) said before coming to power NDA leaders promised to bring down inflation but have nothing to contain price rise.Describing Jaitley's intervention during the debate as ""disappointing"", Anwar said people have no choice but to bear the burden of rising prices.Taking a dig at Modi's initiative to provide cooking gas to poor, he said, now the people have gas but nothing to cook as essential kitchen items are beyond his reach.He wanted to know why the government always fails to take advance action to deal with rising prices.Jayadev Galla (TDP) suggested that central government should have a separate budget for agriculture sector though it could very well merge railway budget with the general budget.He further said that government should consider including pulses in the ambit of the Food Security Act and increase food subsidy to 10 per cent of the GDP from a little of two per cent presently.BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuvraj' (prince) did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014.She said one day Rahul is having tea here and another day at Kalavati's home, which she termed as ""political tourism"".Gandhi had visited the home of Kalavati Bandurkar, the Vidarbha farmer widow in 2008, and had also mentioned about her in Parliament.Mahajan described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'Loh purush' (Iron Man)' and said the ""sleeping beauty who sleeps here is questioning the 'Iron Man',"" an apparent reference to the Congress Vice President.She said Congress had played politics with the slogan of 'Gharibi Hataao (eradicate poverty)' for a long time.Referring to her home state Maharashtra, she claimed that a large number of farmers committed suicide during the time of Congress governments.Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) said the government has not been able to control the price situation even though efforts are being made. The government's priority should be to control price rise, which is affecting poor people the most, he added.Dharmendra Yadav (SP) said farmers have not received any benefit from price rise, adding that there does not seem to be much difference between Congress and BJP governments as under both of them farmers have been weakened.Jayprakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) cautioned that the ""tsunami of price rise"" is a bad signal for the government.Stating that mere use of sophisticated words cannot help in controlling price rise, A P Jithender Reddy (TRS) said lot of people are feeling the pinch. He also urged the government to ""bailout people"" from the clutches of inflation.M Rajamohan Reddy (YSR Cong) urged the government to put in place a comprehensive food pricing and management policy.Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U), Riti Pathak and Uday Pratap Singh (both BJP) also spoke."

More recently  this time, barely a year before Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh  another one has been in the news for the alleged palayan or mass exodus of Hindu families from Muslim-dominated areas.But UPs Upper Doab belt the fertile alluvial plains between the Yamuna and the Ganga stretching from Saharanpur through Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat and Meerut to Ghaziabad, Hapur and Bulandshahr  is today gripped by an unprecedented agricultural crisis centered around sugarcane and bhugtan (payments) to growers by mills. This issue, more than palayan or Hindu-Muslim polarisation, could be the real game-changer, at least in the regions 30-plus Assembly seats out of the states total 403.UP has some 30 lakh farming families who supplied a total 6,428.49 lakh quintals of sugarcane to mills during the recent 2015-16 crushing season. This cane was worth Rs 17,999.37 crore at the UP governments state advised price (SAP) of Rs 280 per quintal.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe SAP has not just been unchanged since 2012-13; for the current season, the Samajwadi Party administration even allowed it to be paid in two instalments. The first instalment of Rs 230 was payable within 14 days of the cane being delivered to the factory and the balance Rs 50 within three months after completion of crushing (mills normally start operations in November and close by April-end).Data from the Cane Commissioners Office in Lucknow, however, reveals mills to have, as on June 21, made payments of only Rs 13,193.60 crore. It means they still owe growers over Rs 4,800 crore. Worse, there are dues of Rs 1,631.08 crore even against the first instalment of Rs 230/quintal payable within 14 days after cane purchase.Shamli sugar mill. (Express Photo: Praveen Khanna) Shamli sugar mill. (Express Photo: Praveen Khanna)Its like not having a salary raise for three years and even this not getting paid, says Jitender Singh Hooda. This 45-bigha (7.6 acres) farmer from Kheri Bairagi, a village in Shamli tehsil/district, has received onlyRs 1.44 lakh for his 1,200 quintals supplied to the sugar mill of Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises Ltd, as against its SAP value of Rs 3.36 lakh.The cane payment crisis is, indeed, most acute in the Upper Doab region, also referred to as Jat belt after the community that is seen to make up roughly a tenth of its population and a third of those engaged in farming. The Upper Doab districts, as the accompanying table shows, currently account for more than 47 per cent of the overall cane dues and 80 per cent of first-instalment arrears owed by mills in UP.Many assume we are a rich and powerful farming community. They should come here and see the reality. We may have once produced big leaders like Chaudhary Charan Singh and Mahendra Singh Tikait, but the fact is that our voice matters little today. Why else is the cane arrears position the worst here? points out Rajvir Singh Mundet, a Shamli-based social worker and convenor of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Sanyukta Morcha.The average Upper Doab farmer, according to him, owns 15 bigha (nearly one hectare or 2.5 acres) and not even 10 per cent has more than 30 bigha (five acres). Sugarcane cultivation was, in the past, remunerative for even small farmers, as they had access to irrigation and mills made regular payments.This is no longer the case with further fragmentation of holdings and cane payment arrears becoming a serious problem, especially since around 2013-14. Sugarcane alone can no longer support ones family. So, you see many Jat farmers taking to sale of milk and even working in factories, which they never used to do until a couple of decades ago, explains Mundet.The small farmers have been impacted the most. Many sent their children to private schools, realising the need of diversifying career options.Towns like Shamli saw a mushrooming of such schools catering to farmers children  especially during the period from 2007-08 and 2012-13, when the cane SAP also rose from Rs 125 to Rs 280 per quintal. But with stagnant SAPs and delayed payments over the last three years, there is a growing trend of school fee defaults.Jagmer Singh Nirwal, who farms 300 bighas (50.5 acres) in Shamlis outskirts, reckons his average cane cultivation cost at Rs 8,000 per bigha. At 60 quintals yield per bigha (i.e. 880 quintals/hectare) and the SAP of Rs 280 per quintal, the gross return works out to Rs 16,800 per bigha. Deducting costs of Rs 11,000  including Rs 35/quintal towards harvesting and Rs 15/quintal for transporting the cane to the mill  leaves a net return of Rs 5,800 per bigha. This is decent, provided the money comes on time though.Nirwal is a relatively big farmer, who also holds the state record of harvesting 1,989.5 quintals per hectare in 2014-15 (the average cane yield for UP was 651.48 quintals, while 788.44 quintals for Shamli district).But he, too, has so far been paid only Rs 4 lakh for 8,000 quintals that should have been worth some Rs 22.4 lakh at the SAP: I am surviving only because of the profits from earlier years. Ordinary farmers do not have this luxury.Most farmers understand that a major factor for delayed payments has to do with sugar prices, with average ex-factory realisations in UP plunging from Rs 31.90 to Rs 25.64 per kg between 2012-13 and 2014-15.But they should at least pay us now, when prices have gone up, notes Hooda. From a low of Rs 22.54/kg in July 2015, average realisations have, in fact, recovered to Rs 33.70 in May. This has led to some companies  notably DCM Shriram, Balrampur Chini, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Dalmia Bharat Sugar  paying 85 per cent or more of their SAP value of cane.Central and eastern UP mills are seemingly keen to pay, unlike the ones here. The state government is least bothered about western UP farmers, while politicians are only interested in raising palayan and other issues to divert attention, alleges Mundet.Cane growers fear that if sugar prices keep rising, the Centre will next open the door for duty-free imports. We suffer when prices fall from over-production. We will also suffer if prices go up and imports take place, complains Hooda.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In 2016-17, there will be 3.5-4 million tonnes gap in demand and supply, Pawar said at the 74th annual convention of the Sugar Technologists Association of India. (Source: PTI)Sugar prices are expected to remain under pressure due to an estimated supply gap of 3.5-4 million tonnes in the next marketing year starting October, former Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said on July 28.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo also asked the industry to be prepared for any government action, including possibility of import of raw sugar to boost domestic supply and check prices.This year, sugar production situation is good. But I dont see similar situation in the next year. In 2016-17, there will be 3.5-4 million tonnes gap in demand and supply, Pawar said at the 74th annual convention of the Sugar Technologists Association of India (STAI).Sugar rates, which at present are ruling in the range of Rs 34-38/kg, may come under pressure due to a likely gap in supply and demand, he said.Next year, with a gap of 3.4 to 4 million tonnes of sugar, there will definitely be an impact on prices and the government will take some steps and the industry should be ready for that, he noted.The government has projected sugar output to decline to 23-23.5 million tonnes in 2016-17 marketing year (October-September), as against 25.1 million tonnes in the current year. Meanwhile, industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) has pegged sugar output at 23.26 million tonnes for next year.Pawar said the countrys sugar demand is around 25.6 million tonnes and is expected to grow at 3-4 per cent per annum. By 2020, sugar demand is pegged at 30 million tonnes.Apprehensive about the governments policies to check price rise in sugar, Pawar asked the industry to be prepared for the possibility of sugar imports.A suggestion has been made to import raw sugar to bridge the gap. There are other alternatives and I hope the government will take appropriate action, he said.To curb price rise in sugar, the government has recently imposed 20 per cent export duty on sugar and withdrawn cane production subsidy to the mills.Expressing concern over low cane productivity and cyclic nature of the crop, Pawar urged the government to take proactive steps to promote modern technologies, including genetic engineering to address biotic and abiotic stress.He also said that a Pune-based institute has developed a transgenic sugarcane plant, and the government should allow field trial of it in restricted areas under the supervision of agriculture universities.The NCP leader said that Indonesia has developed saline and drought-resistant cane variety and the government should give a serious thought to this if the variety has given good results.Pawar asked the sugar mills to take ethanol blending programme seriously and ensure sufficient supply to the oil marketing companies (OMCs).I am informed that distilleries are not able to meet the requirement of OMCs. I think, time has come you take this seriously. There may be some hurdles and this should be sorted out amicably, he advised.Not only cane crop productivity should be raised, the mills should use modern technologies to reduce cost and make more viable business, he added.Former President Pratibha Devisingh Patil asked the industry to focus on use of drip irrigation in cane cultivation and also favoured use of GM cane varieties to boost crop yields.She urged the sugar technologists to work on developing small size machines for use in cane farming while suggesting sugar mills to focus on energy conversion and conservation.There is immense scope to improve production both in field and factory, for which technology is the key, she added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

According to estimates, sugar production during the 2016-17 season is pegged at 23-24 million tonnes.The total availability of sugar during 2016-17 season will be over 31 million tonnes, against the domestic demand of about 26 million tonnes, it said."

His family owns 3 bigha land, which he says provide just about sustenance.""Munde munde matir bhinna (perspectives differ from one person to another),"" he says, when asked why a group of youth, huddled across the road, are rather willing to give ""Modiji and Yogi Adityanath"" a chance, ""mainly"" to bring down crime in the region.But despite his personal liking for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sharma, who is in BSc third year, is somewhat receptive to Rahul's repeated assertions, in meeting after meeting, that Congress will ensure that farm loans are waived off like the UPA government had done in the fag-end of its first term.""My father is a sugarcane farmer so I know the plight of their lot. But such promises (Rahuls) more often than not ring hollow. Modiji's promise on black money has also come out a cropper till now but at least we can see attempts being made,"" Pawan says.But the concern over ""rising cases of crime"" cuts across age groups as Ambika Chaudhary, in his early sixties, echoes Pawan's view that there indeed has been an ""alarming spurt"", especially of lootings and snatchings.Rahul's 'kisan padyatra' outreach, which will meander across the eastern UP districts in its first leg, is aimed at gaining the support of these distressed farmers, which Congress believes will boost the party's prospects in the 2017 assembly election in the state.No wonder, the Congress scion's chopper landed on a makeshift helipad at Pachladi Kritpura village, that houses a large number of sainthwar community people (OBC) battling bad crop fallout, of Deoria's Rudrapur constituency.Rahul visited five houses in the village that lacks a pucca road and power supply is as elusive as the rains. He interacted with the familes of Hanskumar Singh, Pradyuman Singh, Sadasya Singh (brothers) and Om Prakash Singh, who in turn apprised him of the amount they owe in form of outstanding loan dues.Kushinagar and Deoria were among the 50 districts that were declared as drought-hit by the Uttar Pradesh government last year.One senior Congress leader, accompanying Rahul, explained the party's attempt to reach out to the farming community was crucial for it to even make a splash in the 403-member UP Assembly where it currently has a paltry 29 MLAs.""The 2008 farm loan waiver had reaped the maximum dividends for Congress in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. In the same way, this could very well be our trump card. What cannot be overlooked is that the crisis of sugarcane farmers is real and the mills owe them thousands of crores,"" the leader says.State Advisory Price (SAP) of cane has remained unchanged at Rs 280 per quintal in Uttar Pradesh, the countrys second-largest sugar producer, for the last four years.""I had to take a loan of Rs 25,000 this June due to successive years of scanty rainfall. Rahulji met me and assured me that he will ensure that this amount is waived off. I signed the mangpatra (charter of demand) in his presence,"" Om Prakash says.The marginal farmer, a self-confessed Congress loyalist, also enthusiastically points out that Rahul also spoke to his daughter Archita.""He spoke to me and I told him that I want to be a chemist. He wanted to know why not a doctor and I said because of lack of money,"" 16-year-old Archita says.What was Rahul's reply, the reporters ask in chorus. ""Wo kuch nahi bole,"" she walks off and so do the reporters."

We will show phase I of Ganga cleaning in October 2016, while the second phase will be completed two years later,"" Bharti told reporters here.She said tomorrow the government will also launch an application to monitor level of pollution in the river.Gadkari and newly-appointed Ministers of State for Water Resources, Vijay Goel and Sanjeev Balyan, were also present during the briefing.Transport Minister Gadkari said it is ""satisfactory"" that the government is going to begin the work tomorrow. He asserted the projects are being launched after conducting detailed scientific study and will involve use of ""best of the world"" technologies to ensure river pollution is averted.Referring to 'Moksha Dham' works, which relate to construction/repair of crematoria located along the river, Gadkari said the projects will be implemented without hurting public sentiments attached to the holy river even as air and water pollution is kept under check.He also rejected claims that the programme works are taking off late, saying he was ""rather surprised"" the projects are being launched ""within such a short span"" notwithstanding complexity involved in it.Meanwhile, on asked about Balyan and Goel joining the Water Resources Ministry following expansion of Union Ministerial Council yesterday, Bharti said she was ""waiting for the appointments to happen for many days"".She hoped their joining the ministry will ""increase pace of work"" in the Ministry which handles crucial subjects of river-linking and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sichayee Yojana (PMKYS) besides the Namami Gange programme and ""alleviate the burden"".""We were waiting for MoS for many days.

The schemes have been worked out with co-operation of states, taking them into confidence,"" he said.Gadkari also made a strong pitch for recycling waste water from industries located along Ganga to ensure pollution is curbed and cited example of how drainage water is treated and used again in his hometown Nagpur.He said that DPR for STPs is ready and tenders in this regard will be floated ""soon"".About his ministry envisaging waterways projects in Ganga, Gadkari said the work is on in the river's 1620-km stretch between Varanasi and Haldia where adequate water flow is available to transport ships.He informed the government will construct 45 water ports with RoRo (roll-on roll-off) services at five places including Patna and Sahibganj.To another question, both Gadkari and Bharti said the government has been executing the projects with co-operation of five basin states - four of which are ruled by parties other than BJP.""The programme is funded entirely by Centre, but we are working with co-operation with states concerned,"" Bharti said.The new Ganga Act too, she added, will be drafted with consultations with state.Bharti also said the government is for embracing Punjab's Seechewal model of waste water management to make villages located along Ganga open defecation free.The Ministers also insisted on community participation in cleaning the river."

An FIR was eventually lodged on the basis of statement of Akhilanand Mishra, who lost his five-year-old son Ashish in the tragedy.Following an investigation, a charge sheet (of 346 pages) was submitted which found charges against Meena Devi true.Altogether 40 witnesses were produced and cross-examined. Those whose statements were recorded included parents of those children who died in the tragedy, doctors who conducted post-mortem, the cook who had prepared the meal and served it to the children, forensic experts and police officials who were associated with the investigation of the case.The charge sheet said that Rai had purchased pesticide from a sugar factory and kept it in a room where other items of the midday meal were stored.The food on that fateful day was cooked with the pesticide, which led to the deaths.A polygraph test was conducted on Meena to establish charges against her. The forensic report, too, confirmed traces of toxic insecticide in the food served to the children."

Obviously, there are some who find that difficult to digest and come up with imaginative and fanciful ideas to belittle that achievement. ""The fact is that India's economic success is the hard-won result of prudence, sound policy and effective management,"" he said at the Bloomberg India Economic Forum.Stating that India's growth rate is acknowledged as the highest among major economies, he said, ""There are some who remain confused and have said the growth rate does not 'feel' right. Perhaps I can be of some assistance to them in reducing the confusion, by stating facts in place of feelings.""Reeling out statistics, he said there has been a smart pickup in credit growth after September. While credit off-take in the year to February increased by 11.5 per cent, overall fund flow to the corporate sector through equity and borrowings rose by over 30 per cent in the first three quarters of 2015-16.Also, the trend of firms facing credit rating downgrade in 2013 and 2014 has been reversed and in the first half of fiscal year 2015-16, for every company getting a downgrade, there were more than two companies which received upgrades, the best level in recent years, he said.""Net foreign direct investment in the third quarter of the current financial year was an all-time record,"" he said highlighting increased overseas funds in fertiliser, sugar and agricultural machinery, sectors closely connected with rural economy.Also, FDI in construction saw 316 per cent growth, while the same in software and hardware almost quadrupled.""In a difficult global environment for exports, manufacturing output has fluctuated. However, several key sub-sectors of manufacturing are growing rapidly,"" he said.Modi said his government's focus was on agriculture and doubling farm income by 2022. Also, his strategy is to optimise use of resources through efficient implementation.""We have initiated many steps. Many more lie ahead. Some have begun bearing fruit. What we have achieved so far, gives me the confidence that with the support of people, we can transform India.""I know it will be difficult. But I am sure it is doable. And I am confident, it will be done,"" Modi said.Stating that experts are unanimous India is one of the world economy's brightest spots, he said the country has low inflation, a low balance of payments and current account deficit and a high rate of growth.""This is the result of good policy, not good fortune,"" he said.Underscoring good governance points, he said between 2008 and 2009 crude oil prices fell steeply from a peak of USD 147 per barrel to less than USD 50, a fall steeper than that seen between 2014 and 2015.""Yet in 2009-10, India's fiscal deficit, current account deficit and inflation rate, all got substantially worse. And this slid was from a higher base figure for all three. But in 2015-16, all three have improved, from a lower base,"" he said.He said, if oil prices were the driver of success, many emerging economies dependent on oil imports would have shown similar results. But they are not.""We have not been lucky with global trade or growth. Both are low, and have not helped us in terms of export stimulus,"" he said, adding India has also had two successive years of drought which was compounded by unseasonal hailstorms.Yet food grain production has remained much higher and inflation much lower, than in the last comparable drought year, which was 2009-10, he said.On fiscal consolidation, he said ambitious fiscal targets have been met in each of the previous two years.""We have reduced the deficit even while increasing capital expenditure. And the reduction has come despite an unprecedented steep cut in the Centre's share of tax revenues, in the award of the 14th Finance Commission,"" he said adding 2016-17 fiscal deficit target of 3.5 per cent of GDP is the second-lowest level in the last 40 years.Topping the increase FDI inflows in fertiliser, sugar and agricultural machinery sectors, overseas fund flow in the automobile industry grew 71 per cent.""This is concrete evidence that Make in India policy is having effect in employment intensive sectors,"" he said adding motor vehicle production, which is a strong indicator of consumer purchasing power and economic activity, has grown at 7.6 per cent.The employment-intensive wearing apparel sector has grown at 8.7 per cent. Manufacturing of furniture has grown by 57 per cent, suggesting a pickup in sales of flats and houses, he said."

On top of it, this is 'Mahar vatan' land, which cannot be transferred without the government's permission, which in this case was not taken,"" Sawant alleged.'Watan' lands are 'inam' (gift from a ruler to a subject) for service. The term is generally used in a wider sense to denote any alienation in land with or without service.NCP MLC Kiran Pawaskar said the Congress should instead move court against Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for ""shielding"" Mahajan.""This is not the first time Mahajan has been accused of indulging in wrongdoings. Firstly, he has violated his oath that he took before becoming a minister by keeping illegal property in his name. Also, he is a habitual offender. There was no action taken against him when he had once carried a revolver while visiting students in school,"" he said.Pawaskar said that Mahajan has no right to continue as minister.""Such a person has no right to be a minister. Either the CM takes immediate action against him or the Congress, instead of approaching the court against Mahajan, should instead do so against Fadnavis for shielding and not taking action against his errant minister,"" Pawaskar said.When contacted for his reaction, Mahajan merely said that he could not recall clearly whether he had purchased any such land.Khadse had resigned recently over allegations of graft and conflict of interest in the purchase of land in Pune district in name of his kin."
