Whether in states or at the Centre, where there are different political parties, we must face the situation. We must rise above political lines and face the situation together,"" former Agriculture Minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar said during a short debate on drought in the Upper House.Among 11 states, Uttar Pradesh is worst affected followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, he said and emphasised the need to provide immediate relief.While there is no shortage of foodgrains in the country this year, the drinking water crisis is ""serious"", he said.""We have to give full attention to drinking water. Why do we have this problem? We have to think of short and long term policy and serious solutions to address this issue,"" he said, and suggested that the government focus on water conservation and rainwater harvesting to boost groundwater level.He also asked the government to complete 312 pending irrigation projects in India, of which 240 projects are in five states including Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.Urging the Centre to be considerate towards the states facing drought, Pawar said ""every state expects the government at the centre to help them out. In 2015-16, the states made their demand for relief package. Was it met?""""The actual release was less than 50 per cent. I think there should be some improvement (in giving funds),"" he said, and asked the government to ensure that states use relief funds for water conservation.Against the demand of Rs 3,830 crore drought relief fund, Karnataka was sanctioned only Rs 1,540 crore for losses incurred due to drought during the 2015-16 kharif season. Similarly, Chhattisgarh was given Rs 855 crore against Rs 6,093 crore, while Madhya Pradesh was given Rs 1,875 crore against requirement of Rs 4,884 crore, he said.Narrating the severity of drinking water crisis at a village in Nashik, Pawar said people there get one water tanker in 30 days and have to wait 25 days for the next one. One tanker of water meets only 33 per cent of the requirement of this village.""The situation is such that people gherao the tankers and ... Section 144 is imposed to prohibit assembly of more people. People's efforts are just to collect and store water,"" the veteran NCP leader said.Pawar also attacked Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh for his statement yesterday that states like Maharasthra have irrigation to supply water to sugar mills.""I don't know how the Agriculture Minister has come to this conclusion. It is true that sugarcane requires lot of water. ...The minister has impression that all water was used for cane,"" he said while sharing a research report on cultivating sugarcane crop in tropical areas with less water.Stating that the drought situation was ""grave and very serious"", Pawar said, ""in my public life, I have made attempts to mitigate impact of drought when I worked in the state and also at the Centre for 10 years. But the situation that we are witnessing today is more serious, particularly looking at the media reports.""Before the debate commenced, Opposition members including those from Congress and JD(U) took strong objection to the absence of the Agriculture Minister and Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti.""Half of the country's population is facing water crisis. The drought issue is very serious. The concerned minister should be here. It is a very deep crisis,"" JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav said.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said, ""We cannot have debate without the minister concerned. You adjourn the House. Let's start the debate when he is here.""Deputy Chairman P J Kurien tried to convince members that the subject was a serious one and the government ""works on a joint responsibility. Even if concerned minister is not here, we can continue the debate.""The debate, however, started after the arrival of the concerned ministers.Initiating the debate, A U Singh Deo (BJD) expressed concern over meagre allocation of funds and the delay in its release to drought-hit states, especially Odisha.He also said there was a huge difference in state's and the Centre's assessment of losses due to drought, because of which states do not get full relief funds.""Total allocation for State Disaster Relief Fund is Rs 61,000 crore for all states. Rs 20,000 crore was estimated loss for kharif season of 2015-16. Where will the money come from? Centre should provide more help,"" Singh Deo said, adding Odisha should not be ignored as it is the poorest state.Blaming the government for not taking serious note of the Met Department's monsoon forecast, he said a new department should be established to look into drought, floods and other natural calamities and take mitigation measures.Expressing concern over the serious drought situation in Maharasthra, Rajani Patil (Cong) said the NDA government should stop blaming the previous regimes for the water crisis.""You have been in the office for two years. It is not proper to shift the responsibility. You give up this attitude fast and show results,"" she said.Patil also demanded more work days under MGNREGA in drought-hit states.Observing how transporation of water tankers to Latur was being politicised, she said ""lotus adorns the tankers carrying water. There is politics in this also. Stop doing this.""To address the water crisis, she sought desilting operations in check-dams, lakes and ponds on an urgent basis and easing norms for speedy implementation of this work.Sharing severe drought crisis in Maharasthra, she said ""I come from Marathwada. We don't call Marathwada now, we call tankerwada."" She also narrated a story of a farmer who committed suicide recently due to lack of funds for his daughter's marriage scheduled today.""We collected funds for his daughter's marriage which happened today. In another taluk, a 10 year-old child who went to fetch water fell into the well and died. This is the plight of Marathwada,"" she said.Sharing the data of rising farmers' suicides in Maharashtra, Patil blamed the Centre and the state government for lack of sensitivity towards people's suffering, saying there were over 2500 farmers' suicides in the state in 2015 and such cases were being reported this year as well.Ajay Sancheti (BJP) said the Ministries of Water Resources, Agriculture, Rural Development should work together and make a long term policy to deal with the issues of drought and floods.Criticising successive governments, Naresh Agrawal (SP) said that India does not have an effective long term policy to deal with such natural calamities and added that the current drought across the country has led to drinking water problems both for the people and the livestock.Observing that the government's efforts in tackling drought were not enough, Sharad Yadav (JD-U) said that government should work on bringing water under the Union list so that disputes relating to rivers can be tackled and effective policies for water conservation evolved.""Water has become a big issue of dispute today and if we do not take adequate steps to check it, the time is not far that we will have a civil war inside the country over water,"" the senior JD(U) leader warned.Rajpal Singh Saini (BSP) said the Centre's work to mitigate drought relief in Bundelkhand was not enough. Farmers are distressed and are forced to commit suicide. In the last few years around 3,023 farmers have committed suicide in Bundelkhand, he added.Raising the controversy over IPL matches in Maharashtra, Saini said such issues bring to fore the stark differences between the lives of the people ""living in India and Bharat"".Tapan Kumar Sen (CPI-M) said the ""deep crisis"" due to drought has impacted around 33 crore people across 11 states in more that 33 districts. Delayed action has further exacerbated the situation of the people and the livestock in the affected areas.Attacking the government over the implementation of the MGNREGA, Sen suggested that the scheme should be properly utilised as it can help alleviate some difficulties of the people. He said urban areas were also severely impacted by the drought situation.Maintaining that the government should work to provide drinking water for the people and cattle, D Raja (CPI) attacked the Centre for failing to anticipate the severity of the drought situation in the country and its preparedness to mitigate the impact.He said the public sector banks have distanced themselves from giving loans to the farmers forcing them to turn towards private moneylenders, which is further affecting their living condition. Raja suggested steps to strengthen MGNREGA, PDS and Food Security scheme to tackle the drought situation.Rajiv Chandrasekhar (Ind) said ""We are a mute spectator to this annual tragedy. We need to move beyond the rhetoric and politics of drought.""He suggested developing short as well as medium to long term policies to tackle drought and create a National Water Management Strategy.Mohd Ali Khan (INC) drew the attention of the House towards the severe drought condition in Telangana, saying it has impacted 370 mandals in the state and attacked the Centre for not giving the full assistance amount as sought by the state government.Basawaraj Patil (BJP) referred to the rising heat wave conditions in the country and said the government should address the issue as heat wave will rise in May and June which may lead to loss of human life. He suggested schemes to save river water that goes into the sea.Chandrapal Singh Yadav (SP) said Bundelkhand was facing severe drought like situation and wanted de-silting of old ponds in the region for water conservation, provision of alternate livelihood for farmers in case of drought and flood and availability of good quality seeds.Bhupender Yadav (BJP) said policies need to be made for conservation of above ground water resources and rejuvenation of underground aquifers.He also suggested that the government make disaster relief norms based on different regions and not for the entire nation as a single entity.Vishambhar Prasad Nishad (SP) said that Bundelkhand has been severely impacted by the drought and the government needs to address the issue at the earliest.Ahmed Patel (Cong) compared the drought situation to cancer which spreads slowly but is fatal. He expressed concern at the prevailing situation and said ICUs were not getting water and fights could break out over water shortage.Taking a jibe at the Prime Minister for his 'Mann ki Baat' radio programme, he said there is need for his government to list the pain of the drought affected people.Emphasising on the need for government to be aware of the grave situation, Patel said the findings of Central Water Commission indicating water crisis were not paid attention to. This issue is something beyond party politics, he added.INLD member Ram Kumar Kashyap said that there were reports that drought had forced people in Maharashtra to marry twice, with one wife looking after family and other fetching water. He emphasised on the importance of planting more trees.Dr Sanjay Singh (Cong) spoke for creating a special ministry which could draw up long term plans and conduct research to deal with global warming and climate change.K C Tyagi (JD-U) sought that loans extended to farmers be waived and said that ""sensibilities have weakened"" as people had the urge to watch IPL at such a time.Balwinder Singh Bhunder (SAD) sought subsidy for farmers to install sprinklers and drip irrigation systems. Vijay Darda (Cong) and Sanjiv Kumar (JMM) also spoke about the problems being faced by people in Maharshtra and Jharkhand. A V Swamy (Ind) also spoke on the subject."

We will continue to fight, said JNU Student Union general secretary Rama Naga, facing charge of sedition along with Kanhaiya, Umer and others in connection with February 9 Afzal Guru event.Meanwhile, more civil society groups, including Anhad and individuals from different walks of life, came in support to the students protests, giving a boost to the spirit of those sitting on hunger strike.Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists, meanwhile, brought a new twist to their agitation a day after the JNU administration assured them of removing reprimanding remarks made against their leader Saurabh Sharma by a probe committee in lieu of their commitment to call off their strike immediately.Indefinite hunger strike was called off. But, our relay hunger strike will continue till all our demands are accepted, ABVP leader Alok Singh announced.The JNU vice-chancellor on Wednesday appealed to the students to call off their strike. His efforts, however, failed to yield any result as the leftist students took serious exception to the terming of their strike an unlawful activity by the vice-chancellor and vowed to further intensify their struggle.Even if Comrade Kanhaiya has to discontinue due to ill health, the struggle will continue. Our hunger strike will continue. If needed, more people will join, JNU Student Union vice-president Shehla Rashid, who too was not in health, said."

The order has pegged the value of the two assets at Rs 55 crore.The ED, official sources said, has also put prohibitory orders on the running factory, identified as Girna Sugar mill, and the land located adjacent to it.The agency, according to sources, found in its probe that the mill was purchased by Bhujbal's firm after ""gross under-valuation"" at Rs 27 crore and was purchased as part of an auction conducted by the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in 2010.They said ""proceeds of crime"" of money laundering funds generated by the former Deputy Chief Minister of the state and his family members were used to purchase these two assets.This is the fourth attachment order issued by the agency in the case and it has already attached assets, both movable and immovable, worth Rs 280 crore earlier.An attachment order under PMLA laws is aimed to deprive the accused from obtaining benefits of their alleged ill-gotten wealth and the accused parties can appeal against the order before the Adjudicating Authority of the said Act within 180 days.Bhujbal, along with his ex-Member of Parliament nephew Samir have been arrested in the case by the ED earlier and they are at present in jail.The agency has filed two FIRs against Bhujbal, his son Pankaj and Samir and others under the provisions of PMLA, based on Mumbai Polices' ACB FIRs, to probe alleged irregularities in the construction of Delhi-based state guest house Maharashtra Sadan and the Kalina land grabbing case.The Bombay High Court, in December, 2014, had constituted a Special Investigation Team comprising the ED and the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to conduct the inquiry against the politician and others.The ACB complaint names Pankaj and Samir and they had been booked under IPC Sections related to cheating, criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and relevant provisions of Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act."

Earlier the court had sought status report from the government.Armed bandits had waylaid the family near Dostpur village in the district while they were on the way to Shahjahanpur to attend a function on the night of July 29.The bandits then overpowered the occupants and took them a few metres away from the highway into a muddy sugar cane field, where they tied the three male members and gang-raped the minor and her 35-year-old mother.The police had claimed to have cracked the case and arrested six people, including the main accused Saleem Bawaria, member of the Bawaria gang, a notorious criminal nomadic tribe.As the incident triggered a massive outrage, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav suspended seven police personnel, including the then district police chief."
59208ad17be9e04a516a94f2,Quota no answer to Maratha stir,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573707/quota-no-answer-maratha-stir.html,2016-10-02,"October 03, 2016, DHNS 23:44 ISTThe protests started by members of the Maratha community in parts of Maharashtra some weeks ago have spread and gained in strength, and are likely to escalate further. The silent marches with no clear leaders and wide participation by women have shaken the political establishment in the state. The immediate trigger for the protests was the gang-rape and murder of a Maratha girl reportedly by some Dalit men in Kopardi near Ahmednagar, but they have now grown into a vehicle for other issues and demands. These include death sentence for the culprits in the case, repeal of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act and reservation for the Marathas in education and employment. There cannot be action, or even a promise of action, on any of these demands. The punishment in the case is to be decided by the courts. The SC/ST Act was legislated as a deterrence against atrocities committed on Dalits, who are the weakest section in society. It was strengthened recently, and there is no case for its repeal.The previous UPA government had granted 16% reservation to the Marathas. The decision was stayed by the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court has refused to vacate the stay. So, neither the state government nor the Centre can do anything on these demands. But all political parties, and especially their Maratha leaders, have supported the protests. There are expressions of sympathy from the ruling BJP too. The irony is that the Marathas, who form about 30% of the population, are politically and economically the strongest community in the state. Their leaders have dominated politics, industries like sugar and agriculture. These sectors of the economy have declined in the past few years and the community has a grouse that it is getting left behind and has been unable to gain from development.Dominant communities in other states like the Patidars in Gujarat, the Jats in Haryana and elsewhere and the Kapus in Andhra Pradesh have also launched agitations, making similar demands and expressing similar sentiments. They may be signs of a growing agrarian discontent and a crisis affecting traditional occupations and small industries. Many farming and peasant communities are in distress. Reservation is no solution because the existing quota system cannot be stretched to benefit more people. The norms do not allow that,too, and in any case there are too few opportunities to be shared. Development that creates more jobs and opportunities can only address these demands and grievances. Unfortunately, the agitations have become mobilisations based on castes and communities, though the basic grievances are economic. The resulting tension and conflicts between communities are bad for society."

A convention was held in Raichur on Sunday, at which thirty-eight companies participated.He said 37 of these companies had sought the allotment of about 2,000 acres of land at the growth centre for a projected investment of Rs. 2,316 crore to set up mega and small-scale industries such as steel plants, bulk drug units, readymade garment mills, spinning mills, sugar manufacturing units, edible oil refinery units and dairies. These industries could provide employment for about 8,000 people, he said.Mr. Naidu said the Government would focus on setting up of thermal power plants near the growth centre so as to meet the power demand in the industrial area.He said the Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) had already submitted an application seeking an allotment of 1,000 acres at the growth centre for setting up a 500-MW thermal plant at an estimated cost of Rs. 4,000 crore.A private company had also come forward to set up a thermal plant near the centre at an investment of about Rs. 5,000. It had sought the allotment of about 1,800 acres of land, he said. The Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board had been asked to process the application and initiate measures to acquire additional land for the purpose, he added."

With his retirement at the end July, the city lost one of its culinary titans that quietly shaped the food that we ate.Distinct cuisinesAfter all, the Vivanta by Taj - President is home to three restaurants, each serving a distinct cuisine: Thai Pavilion, Trattoria (the Italian coffee shop) and Konkan Caf in addition to the bar, Wink (which replaced the iconic Library Bar).Solomons replacement is chef Chakravarthy, whos already done one major stint at the property though his most recent position was as Executive Chef of Vivanta by Taj - Yeshwantpur, the hotel chains largest property in Bengaluru.Chakravarthy has had a peripatetic childhood, since his father worked in government education, and as a result, has lived all over the country. His tenure with the Taj Group of Hotels has mirrored that constant movement, and hes spent time in hotel kitchens in Delhi and Hyderabad in addition to his stints in Mumbai (where he worked under Solomon).Smooth handoverThe day we caught up with Chakravarthy, he was still living in the hotel while looking for accommodation following the move. With a perpetual toothy smile and the coolness that comes with experience, Chakravarthy elaborated on his past with the hotel group, as well as his plans for the future.Hed spent between close to a decade at the Vivanta by Taj - President before moving to Bengaluru in 2011, so hes familiar both with the hotel and its staff. This allowed his handover from chef Solomon to be short, as opposed to the normal month that a change of guard would normally take. He says, Im so used to this hotel, so the handover was just four days.When asked about his relationship with Chef Solomon, Chakravarthy said with enthusiasm, I think, the best, you can say. Every second day he used to call me up or I used to call him up. Not because of the operations, but I saw this, this is nice. Why dont you try it? And I used to say, this is very nice, why dont you try it? I had a very good rapport with him.Ringing in changeWhile talking to Chakravarthy, what becomes evident is that he knows the Vivanta by Taj - President intimately, and that he was involved in some way or the other when it came to most of the changes that have been made to refresh the lobbys three restaurants.So Trattoria has gone from a pizzeria and pasta joint, which got converted into a very Italian eatery, where you get a lot of meats. Obviously pizza and pasta is an integral part, [but theres also] lots of antipasti and good deserts, he says.Chakravarthy talks about introducing seafood like sea bass and John Dory to diners when the Italian eatery was re-launched in 2000 with a giant mural along the back wall, pink sofas to add more colour to the newly redesigned space.It was renovated again in 2013, though most of the menu is still the same.Similarly, he was a deputy to chef Solomon when Thai Pavillion was redesigned moving from the brightly lit, some might even call it kitschy interiors to the moody and minimal space it is today. The interiors, crockery and food got a facelift, and Chakravarthy remembers getting involved in all aspects of the changes: from adding new sauces to the tables to changing the cutlery.True to flavourIf Chakravarthy has an overarching vision, it is not to tamper with the philosophy and passion that have built each of the propertys restaurants.He points out that all three restaurants are very rustic and theyre fast food, He clarifies, he doesnt mean the term in the sense of processed food, but that the food has to reach the table, fresh and hot, without skimping on flavour. When it comes to his own cooking viewpoint, he says, make it simple.The hotels three restaurants exemplify this maxim, as each restaurant uses traditional techniques to bring a sense of authenticity to the plate. So whereas other coastal eateries use liberal amounts of butter to toss their seafood, at Konkan Caf, the dish is cooked as it would be in a Malabar home. Similarly, the sauces at Thai Pavilion are made using recipes that were learned in Thailand, and not in a Thai restaurant, where tradition often loses out to efficiency.Immediate changesThe changes Chakravarthy plans to make immediately are to the modernise the patisserie and baked goods on offer, both for hotel guests at breakfast and that are sold through Sugar and Spice, the hotels patisserie.Chakravarthy spends time in the kitchen daily, in addition to overseeing the large team of chefs that take care of hotel restaurants and banquet requirements. He makes it a point to prepare food daily whether its for service or just the testing of new recipes, ingredients and ideas.

Singhs refrain was that the Modi government had sanctioned more funds than the previous Congress-led regime.It is a misfortune of Marathwada that 90% of farms do not get water despite the presence of big dams. The dams were built to serve the needs of the sugar mills and farmers did not get any benefits to irrigate their farms, the agriculture minister said. Though the Shiv Sena shares power with the BJP in Maharashtra, the allies are often at loggerheads.The Shiv Sena loses no opportunity to pinprick the BJP. The Lok Sabha witnessed another round of heated exchange when Singh accused the previous UPA government of delaying release of funds for the MGNREGA."

These mills have Rs 113 crore pending towards cane growers and Rs 110 crore pending as mandatory recovery charges.The decision to recover the dues from the mills was taken at a cabinet meeting held a couple of days ago. It is learnt that on the orders of Deputy Commissioners (DCs), a team of officials from Taxation and Excise Department, Food and Civil Supply Department, Punjab Co-operative Societies, Punjab Revenue Department and police officials sealed these mills  three in Doaba region, two in Majha and two in Malwa region.Earlier, on September 1, the Punjab state government in its order from the office of cane commissioner to the owners of all the seven private mills of state had asked them to pay Rs 113 crores dues to the cane growers of the state by September 10 or face action. However, the mill owners did not comply and threatened to close the mills for the coming crushing season.Later, the Punjab state government paid the farmers to avoid unrest. Significantly, the rate of cane in Punjab was fixed at Rs 295 per quintal by the Punjab state government and out of which 16 sugar mills, including seven private and nine co-operative mills, had to pay Rs 245 per quintal (as per an agreement with the government) to the farmers and remaining Rs 50 was to be paid by the government. This decision was taken in the light of poor per quintal rate of sugar during last season but a condition was also put that if the rate of the sugar will be above Rs 3000 per quintal then the subsidy amount would be paid by the mills only, said sources.Punjab Agriculture Minister Tota Singh, when contacted, told The Indian Express that the Deputy Commissioners (DCs) have been asked to seal the stocks of all the seven sugar mills. We do not want any clash with the owners of the mills and if they pay the dues then their stocks will not be touched. They are only sealed as of now, he said. We have always taken care of the interest of the sugar mill owners. They made huge profits and should now pay mandatory charges as well as governments dues, added the minister.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: isro.gov.in) Space Applications Centre Director Tapan Misra. (Source: isro.gov.in)Stating that there is no paucity of innovation in India, Tapan Misra, the director of Space Applications Centre  an arm of ISRO  said that the countrys space agency has been helping the government in keeping the prices of agri-commodities in check through advanced predictions using satellite imagery.You would be seeing that the prices of potatoes or onions do not rise as much as they once used to. There was a time when their prices used to rise 500 percent and governments used to fall. The reason is that we do predictions based on satellite imaging and give production estimates to the government, said Misra while addressing an award ceremony of Gujarat Innovation Society (GIS) where Ela Bhatt, the founder of SEWA, Ahmedabad was awarded along with 14 other innovators.So if they know that the sugarcane production in UP and Maharashtra is going to be low, the government gets time to book sugar from Brazil. That is the reason why the prices of sugar have been between Rs 20-40 per kilogram during the last 10 years. The prices are lower than the inflation rates, he added.We (ISRO) has given the country so many communication satellites. Through the television programmes aired through these satellites we make the country laugh and also make them cry; fights in family happen and they stop as well. We do not give importance to this, but only when we do something like a Mars mission then ISROs contribution is acknowledged, Misra said while stressing on the innovations done by scientists at this institution.The senior ISRO scientist said that Indians do not respect the fact that a lot of innovations happen in the country with frugal finance. He narrated how SAC was planning to buy a special kind of CNC machine from Germany, but got the same made through a local company in Rajkot. If we had bought from Germany, it would have costed us Rs 12 crore, and we only paid Rs 1.5 crore to the local company. We ended up saving a lot of money, Misra said about a decision that was made a couple of months back.The chief guest of the event Dr C Muralikrishna Kumar from Niti Aayog said the NDA government under the Atal Innovation Mission will begin work on the establishing 500 tinkering labs in schools across the country in the next one month. We will set up a challenge where schools will compete to set up these laboratories that will boost the spirit of innovation among school children.Meanwhile, the GIS awards that were given out during the event included Ela Bhatt, founder of SEWA. She was given the Gujarat Ratna A life for innovation award. Diamond baron, Savji Dholakia, Managing Director of Hari Krishna Exports Pvt. Ltd., and Mr. Jaysukh O. Patel received the Hercules Award for conducting the highest and biggest loyalty program ever for employees in Surat and for a LED Motion Sensor Light for prevention of electricity wastage in Ahmedabad, respectively.The Achievers Award were bestowed upon Dr. Harish R Gershom for inventing HARISOPHONE, a musical instrument for augmenting the cure of human ailments through sound therapy in Ahmedabad , and Mr. Vijay Kothari who received it for conceptualizing the Waste Out of Wealth (WoW) Program meant for shredding secret records of companies and waste management and pollution prevention in Ahmedabad.The trendsetter awards were given to Nikisha Bhadreshbhai Jariwalas innovation that deals with an exquisite way to transliterate Gujarati text into Braille, a crucial aid for the visually impaired in Surat.

(File Photo) Apart from agriculture, there is huge potential for industrial growth in the districts that will open up greater job opportunities, says Fadnavis. (File Photo)The state government is working towards holistic development of all the eight districts of backward Marathwada to create infrastructure for growth of agriculture and industries. To begin with, the regions foremost challenge is to tackle drought. All the eight districts have faced drought in the last two years, said Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Saturday during his visit to Aurangabad.The flagship Jalyukta Shivar project, undertaken aggressively in Marathwada, has helped provide some relief to the farmers.While announcing that the second phase of Jalyukta Shivar would be pushed on a war-footing in the eight districts, Fadnavis said, Apart from agriculture, there is huge potential for industrial growth in the districts that will open up greater employment opportunities.Marathwada comprises the eight districts of Aurangabad, Beed, Nanded, Latur, Osmanabad, Parbhani and Hingoli. Among the worst drought-hit districts were Latur, Osmanabad, Beed and Parbhani.The region, which has lagged behind in industrial development, is being given special concessions and opened up to sectors that can generate employment. The region, which has sizeable cotton cultivation, is being provided with textile-related industrial units.While initiating measures for tackling drought, the government has already banned new sugar mills in the region. Farm experts are being roped in to guide farmers look for alternative crop patterns with less investments and higher returns.This year, the government has promoted tur cultivation, which has huge demand across the country and outside. Inter-cropping and horticulture too are being pushed to help farmers. In addition, the government has taken up dairy development in Marathwada, which can be an alternative source of livelihood especially when crop fails due to poor rains.The government believes water conservation projects in the next two years would help build infrastructure that could make agriculture more lucrative. Farm ponds and wells can serve as water storage facilities and help farmers cultivate at least one crop in hard times.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Representational Image) The reality is prohibition never really eliminates drinking, it just shoves it underground. (Representational Image)Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has some very original advise for those craving alcohol in his state where there is a blanket ban on consumption and possession. Turn off the lights and drink juice, you will feel the same, suggested Kumar primly. He continued to bait recreational drinkers not just in Bihar but everywhere in India by declaring that enforcing prohibition has been the highlight of his career. I feel a deep sense of fulfillment after banning alcohol, he claimed. Not that it was likely to feature on anybodys bucket list, but theres now yet another reason never to go to Bihar.WATCH VIDEO: Bihar Liquor Ban: Patna High Court Strikes Down Liquor Ban, Terms It IllegalDrinking in India has always been frowned upon. An earlier generation of Indians never drank in front of their parents. Thats come full circle. Todays teenagers in Delhi insist on parents serving Bacardi breezers at their parties. Parents have resigned to the fact that if they dont, the kids will get it anyway and, wisely, emphasise drinking responsibly. However, morally motivated laws find favour with segments of the electorate and conservative traditionalists, of which India has a never-ending supply.Mr Kumar, undoubtedly, is an excellent citizen and astute politician, a righteous teetotaller determined to improve the lot of his people. Hes not entirely wrong about deriving a buzz from juice either; there is something called a sugar rush. It works when youre four. Thats why all parenting books advise never giving toddlers chocolate at bedtime; it gives them an instant high. Sadly, for the vast majority of us, our taste buds were contaminated at the cusp of adulthood and we need something a lot stronger than juice and darkness to fade into a pleasurable, easy zone. It might be clutching at straws to poke a hole in Mr Kumars theory but if hes so concerned about his citizens health, he should be banning juice as well. In some cases, people with type 2 diabetes, especially, are better off having 30 ml of vodka with water than a glass of canned orange juice that has over 12 spoons of sugar.The real question, however, is why people living in the worlds largest democracy are not allowed to decide for themselves what they want to, or dont want to consume. By all means, restrict sales to minors and educate the public on the dangers of liquor. They can make an informed choice.The reality is prohibition never really eliminates drinking, it just shoves it underground. The rest of the world has moved on, with countries contemplating legalising intoxicants like cannabis and hashish. Currently, you can buy hallucinogens and party pills at bars in Amsterdam over the counter, with detailed descriptions of the effects of the drug. Mature democracies know that when you take illicit drugs off the street and make them legit, the seller is responsible for the quality of the product, which ultimately reduces fatalities. It also reduces the thrill factor for the consumer. Half the fun of doing drugs is knowing you shouldnt be doing them. Wheres the excitement and intrigue if you can simply order MDMA as a side with your pizza? Like the luxury market that thrives on scarcity, prohibition increases the attractiveness of alcohol, especially among the young, who are by nature defiant. And the most susceptible to bad decisions and spurious alcohol.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Dinkar Zoting retired as a High Court judge in 2006.Khadse has also come under fire for discrepancies in the purchase of an 80-acre farm land in Jalgaons Bhusawal. While records show that the land was purchased from farmers for the purpose of a private sugar mill in 2001, the allegations are that 50 per cent of the land was purchased in the name of the mills directors, and Khadses kin.Watch Video: Whats making newsWhile activists and the Opposition had demanded a probe on this land controversy too, the Chief Minister opted against it.Sources said that both the CM and the BJP leadership was wary that bringing the Bhusawal land controversy in the scope of inquiry might just bring the party more bad press.The name of another senior BJP minister, Girish Mahajan, who is a director on the mills firm, had cropped up in the matter. The government has already given a clean chit to Mahajan in the issue. The party is now keen that this issue does not crop up again, a source revealed.Also left out from the panels ambit is the allegation raised against Khadse in the bribery demand scandal involving the latters personal aide Gajanan Patil. The accusation that Khadse had received calls from underworld don Dawood Ibrahim wont be probed too. The Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Anti-Terrorism Squad investigated these matters and found no merit in the accusations raised against him, a source said.Incidentally, Khadse, who quit office on June 4, had demanded a probe on all allegations raised against him.The inquiry panel has been asked to probe the status of the Bhosari land acquisition, besides investigating if the land could have been transferred by the original plot owners to Khadses kin. It will also probe whether Khadse had committed a conflict-of-interest in the land deal.The CM has granted the probe panel three months time to complete the investigation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Jasbir Malhi and Kamleshwar Singh) The Chandigarh International Airport runway. (Jasbir Malhi and Kamleshwar Singh)With budget carrier IndiGo announcing the first flight out of the country from Chandigarh International Airport on September 26, the new terminal built at a cost of Rs 1,400 crore can finally justify the price tag and rightfully claim its name.As international passengers begin streaming in and out of the airport, the focus will now shift on what facilities it has and what it lacks.What the airport has: THE airport, though fitted out in shiny granite, glass and metal, still has only basic facilities. Four luggage belts in the vast arrival hall, five departure gates on two levels, a single food stall in the departure lounge, and an ATM outside the terminal  this about describes the total extent of the facilities at the new airport. After the Dubai flight was announced, 18 immigration counters  eight at departure and 10 at arrival  have been set up. One money exchange counter has been set up in the arrival hall. But in order to be a truly international airport, here is what it needs.Connectivity to and from the city: IN keeping with the abysmal shape of public transport in Chandigarh, the airport too is poorly connected. Unless you have your own transport, it costs more to any Tricity destination from the airport by taxi than the chair-car Shatabdi fare from Delhi to Chandigarh.There are two taxi operators at the airport. One charges a flat fare of Rs 750 irrespective of the destination, and another charges Rs 23 per km, much higher than the Rs 8 to Rs 13 per km that private taxi operators normally charge on other routes. The taxis also charge Rs 60 as parking fee.There is a CTU bus service every half an hour, with seven buses doing the rounds, alternating between two destinations in Chandigarh, Sector 17 and PGIMER. The fare is Rs 35.A Mohali Taxi Union functionary says the MTU has not been given permission to put a booth outside the arrival hall on the pattern of Delhi airport. There should be a private taxi booth in which we charge nominal amount from the passengers. Within Chandigarh and Mohali we charge up to Rs 500, says Inderjeet Singh, who heads the Mohali Taxi Union.Airport CEO Sunil Dutt says there are plans to start a prepaid taxi service which will be controlled by the Mohali police, but believes the transport problem is exaggerated. There is a bus service available. It is one of the airports where you have city bus service inside the airport. Private cars are there, Dutt says.Airport Shopping: THINK international travel, and duty-free shopping is inseparable from it. A shopping arcade makes an airport interesting even for the most jet-lagged traveller. And some cities build their entire reputation as destinations on the basis of the duty-free shopping at their airport. Chandigarh International Airport does not yet have this attraction. Dutt says the earliest travellers can hope to have one is next year.Restaurants: FOR a city that boasts many restaurants and even a food street, the airport has one food stall in the departure lounge peddling sandwiches and coffee  sorry, with sugar only. There is one more food stall on the airport premises. With passengers sure to be arriving from various parts of the region to catch their flight out of the country, hungry and tired and at least three more hours to go before their flight, there is nothing more urgently required at the airport than coffee bars and restaurants.First class lounge: A CIP (commercially important person) lounge is something that airlines offer as a perk to their first class passengers. Space has been earmarked for it at the Chandigarh airport, but there is no confirmation about when this will start.Wi-fi: The airport has so far failed to provide wi-fi facilities for passengers. According to the airport administration, they will install it by March next year.Banks: THERE is no ATM facility inside the terminal. These are basic needs at the international airport and if these facilities are not there, passengers will get inconvenienced, says Baljit Singh Shergill, chairman, Travel Agents Association of India (Chandigarh chapter). These facilities should be in place before September 26.Future Plans: THE Chandigarh airport authorities say that they have big plans for the airport and soon passenger-related facilities will be added. It will be one of the best airports in the country. We have started work for it, Dutt says. Within one year, there will be more eateries for the passengers. Very soon you will see large retail and F&B [food and beverage] space.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Sahil WaliaThough the weather has been muggy throughout the week, it has not deterred city hotels and restaurants from rolling out specials for food lovers this weekend.Residents can choose anything from pizza festival to Hyderabadi dawat to monsoon specials. While the rains are yet to drench the city, Round the Clock, a 247 cafe in Hotel Mountview in Sector 10, has already included the monsoon-must-haves in its menu.Apart from the quintessential chai and pakora, the cafe has also included pav bhaaji and keema pav in its menu keeping in mind how everything hot and steamy is the perfect companion for rainy season.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe cafe has also introduced a spread of nine varieties of tea  ginger tea, cardammom tea, masala tea, black pepper tea, to list a few.At JW Marriott, Italian fine dining restaurant Oregano is organising a pizza festival. While one is aware of the gourmet pizzas available at the restaurant, Italian chef Alessio Banchero has decided to give the delicacy a twist to tickle the taste buds of visitors. The ongoing festival serves a sumptuous array of handmade pizzas in various shapes, loaded with fresh ingredients.Every dough is made of a unique blend of flour, yeast, sugar and oil to give it a refined taste that matches the sauce and ingredients placed on top of it, said Banchero.At the festival, visitors can enjoy their pizza in shapes ranging from that of a quarter fold and half-moon to rolled and tongue to pocket.Theres a good balance of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices with toppings like mascarpone and swiss chard, roasted bell peppers and olives, margherita, bocconcini and rocket lettuce, mozzarella, oregano, capers and olives.The rolled pizza with ham and cheese spells comfort food, as does the square pizza with pepperoni and provolone cheese crust. Theres dessert pizza with chocolate in it. The gourmet handmade pizzas are available for dinner till July 17.Taj Chandigarh has invited chef Jabrail from Hyderabad to steer their all-new Dawat-e-Nizam festival at their specialty Indian diner, Dera. The Eid celebrations have set the mood at the restaurant and the chef has created a menu using his special ingredients from Hyderabad.While specialties like Hyderabadi kachhe gosht ki biryani and nalli gosht are much recommended, the tala hua gosht and kebab firdaus seem straight out of a Nizams kitchen.Its a misconception that Hyderabadi food is all about non-vegetarians, said the chef, adding that delicacies like nazami handi, kaddu ka dalcha and the popular Hyderabadi khatti dal and salan are all a part of the festival here.On till July 17, the festival also offers popular Hyderabadi desserts like double ka meetha and khubani ka meetha.

Currently, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) allows use of cocoa butter in chocolates and not vegetable fats, whereas international food standards authority Codex permits 5 per cent vegetable fats. Import and sale of chocolates containing vegetable fats are not allowed in India. The food safety regulator has come out with the draft amendments to the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2016 and sought public views on the same within 30 days.As per the proposed amendments, the FSSAI has allowed use of vegetable fats up to 5 per cent other than cocoa butter in chocolates. It has also proposed the use of artificial sweetener Isomaltulose maximum at 50 per cent of the total sugar without adversely affecting the stability of the product. The addition of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter shall not exceed 5 per cent of the finished product, after deduction of the total weight of any other added edible foodstuffs, without reducing the minimum contents of cocoa materials, as per the draft amendments.The regulator said these two additional ingredients should be mentioned on labels as per the FSSAI (Packaging & Labelling) Regulations, 2011. Experts said the use of vegetable fats in chocolates has been a bone of contention in imported chocolates as number of companies had their consignments withheld at the ports because of non-compliance of Indian standards for chocolates. They said though import and sale of chocolates containing vegetable fats are not allowed in India, some brands are selling them without using the term chocolate on the packaging.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Sourece: PTI) Tarun Gogoi at his press conference in Guwahati. (Sourece: PTI)All exit polls have already shown him the door but Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, ensconced in a high-back chair in the sitting room of his hilltop residence, is so confident of returning to power that for the last two-three days, I have even stopped taking my blood pressure pills.On the eve of the assembly poll results, Gogoi, who has been chief minister for three consecutive terms, refuses to even discuss a scenario of the Congress falling short of the half-way mark in the 126-seat House. What is the point of answering questions like what if? Who knows what will happen tomorrow, why get into speculation? I know we will form the ministry tomorrow and the Congress will get a majority on its own, without anybody. It has been a regular day for me, I met well-wishers, gave interviews. Nothing has been different for me.Is he tense? Not at all. In fact, people talk of rising blood pressure but for the last two-three days, I have even stopped taking my blood pressure medicine. I normally have Telma. I do not know how, but my blood pressure has been normal for the last few days. Even my blood sugar is normal, despite the fact that I am diabetic and hypertensive, Gogoi said.A few kilometres from his Khanapara home is Rajiv Bhawan, the Congress office. There is no mistaking the anxiety there. Debates rage on the constitutional position if, in the event of a hung result, the Governor calls the largest political party or a pre-poll formation which has the requisite numbers.There is also talk of the price the Congress may need to pay to cobble together a post-poll understanding with the AGP which fought the elections with the BJP and BPF by its side. Some even quote unnamed media reports about Gogoi making a statement of making a sacrifice for the sake of the party.Bunkum, says Gogoi. I am not saying that I will be the next chief minister of Assam but that person will certainly be a Congressman. Why should I bother what my party is speculating? See, I take feedback from them but I also get feedback from the ground. There is nothing to this.The morrow, he says, will be like any other result day. I visit a temple, a mosque, a church and a Namghar every time. This time too, I will do the same. Thats it.He will not talk about the possible role the Governor may play in the event of a hung result. But he keeps referring to Governor P B Acharya as a RSS pracharak. He said he has also held several meetings with the Chief Secretary and police to ensure there is no law and order violation on counting day.But if Gogoi sounds confident, so does the BJP. The party office at Hengrabari already wears a festive look. It has been lit up and a giant screen has been placed at the entrance. The BJPs chief ministerial candidate, Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, is in his constituency Majuli.

They cannot afford the out-of-pocket expenditure the disease requires. For them, its a choice between medication and their daily bread. More often than not, they choose the latter.As a result, they skip doses of medication and eventually drop out of treatment. Poor diabetics in villages also worry about availability of drugs and travel expenses.Consider the case of 45-year-old Rathnamma (name changed), a resident of KG Halli. Diagnosed with having diabetes years ago, she has been taking medicines on and off. She depends on her daily savings to buy medicines. I think twice before buying Rs 10 worth of tablets. I can use those Rs 10 to buy coconut and make chutney, she said.Many things come in the way of treatment for poor diabetics. From repaying loans to providing the daily essentials, they have several other more important things to pay for from their meagre income, found a study conducted by the Institute of Public Health in KG Halli, a poor neighbourhood of Bengaluru.Health insuranceThough health insurance policies and government schemes cover several in-patient procedures, they offer little to patients of non-communicable diseases. The survey found that more than 75% of the 9,000 people covered live below Rs 110 a day, said Dr Upendra Bhojani, faculty member, Institute of Public Health. The urban poor spend Rs 300-400 a month (if diabetes is in the initial stage) and Rs 5,000 if they have associated complications.Poor diabetics often cannot get medicines available at government hospitals at lower prices or free of charge. Those from rural areas have to travel a distance to get medicines from district hospitals, said Dr Riyaz Basha, associate professor, department of community medicine, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute. That means loss of daily wage. Travel time is another deterring factor.Diabetes expenditureDiabetics need to spend Rs 100 for tablets each time they undergo a blood sugar test (once in 15 days) besides Rs 50 on travel. Injections will cost Rs 300 to Rs 1,600 a month. A needle costs Rs six.Dr Basha said the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke could help poor diabetics if there was a good co-ordination mechanism."

Pathologists analysed the data results of samples processed for Fasting Blood Sugar and found more than 52% of them to be diabetic.Dr Ravi Kumar, managing director, RV Metropolis, said, India is already infamous as the diabetes capital of the world. The prevalence of diabetes is only increasing because of unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity, family history and stress.Dr Kumar said it was also important to keep a regular check on other parameters if one was diabetic. People with diabetes are susceptible to kidney dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases, neurological problems and much more. They must undergo regular tests and monitoring to ensure all their vital parameters are normal, he added.Diabetics should also ensure their blood pressure is under control, pay attention to foot care, get screening and treatment for retinopathy (which causes blindness), blood lipid control (to regulate cholesterol levels) and screening for early signs of diabetes-related kidney disease, Dr Kumar said."

She urged the people not to disrespect her 12-year-long relationship with Shakeel and said she had the right to choose her life partner.Workers of the BJP and Bajrang Dal had protested outside her house in Mandya on Tuesday.

Its difficult to understand the real motive of those who are opposing our marriage, he said.Meanwhile, Ashithas father Dr Narendra Babu said he was getting threat calls. Speaking to reporters, he said a man claiming to be calling from Dubai warned him that if the marriage was not cancelled, either Ashitha or Shakeel would be bumped off. Another man, who identified himself as Avinash Joshi, offered to personally counsel the couple against the marriage.Narendra Babu said he had reported the threat calls to Diwakar, deputy director, Department of Women and Child Development, who has assured to take the necessary action. Our daughters happiness is all that matters. Our thanks to all those who support us, he said.K S Vimala, state president of Akhila Bharata Janawadi Mahila Sanghatane, a womens rights organisation, called on the families of Ashitha and Shakeel and said those opposing the marriage were violating the fundamental rights of people. She called for legal action against these elements and said such incidents were on the rise after the BJP came to power at the Centre. She said the sugar town of Mandya would not turn into a bitter town.The Mandya East police have booked 10 workers of the BJP and Bajrang Dal for protesting outside Ashithas house.

59235f487be9e01fcef01fed,Needed: Separate narcotic squads to  combat vast drug peddling network,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/547951/needed-separate-narcotic-squads-combat.html,2016-05-22,"Jagadish Angadi May 21, 2016, DHNS 1:29 ISTThe drug network in Bengaluru has spread its tentacles so far and wide that it needs a robust response from the city police machinery. Proposed is a separate narcotic squad under every Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) / Superintendent of Police to track the vast drug peddling network.A senior police officer, preferring anonymity, explains the rationale behind such squads in all frankness: Currently, the police fail to keep a track of repeat offenders as they are occupied with too many other tasks.But the men in khaki have gathered enough information to grasp the enormity of the drug abuse problem in Bengaluru. Squads, they hope, will help the police synergise various faculties and address the issue with more focus.Heres what they know about the basic profile of a young drug addict in the City: Youngsters between 20 and 30 years of age are the most affected. Seventy per cent of them are male, and surprisingly, 50% of the lot are foreigners.Disposing seized drugsOnce caught by the police, they are sent to a rehabilitation centre at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS). The Drug Disposal Committed under DCPs/SP are expected to store the seized materials in a godown till the cases are finally disposed of irrespective of the time taken. Rules mandate that the concerned committee should obtain permission from the magistrate after the case is disposed of and the material is destroyed in a furnace.Existing laws are stringent enough to deal with drug peddling. Suspects will not be able to get bail at least for six months. Punishment is rigorous imprisonment for a period ranging from three to seven years. Foreigners caught in the crime are deported to their countries and their names blacklisted to prevent their re-entry into India.Now, what are these drugs really about and how do they become illegal and banned substances?Experts say drugs are medicines/substances that give a physiological effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, bans the sale, transportation and consumption of certain types of drugs in the country. These are the drugs that youngsters seek for various reasons.Some of these drugs are prepared from the extracts of flowers and buds of certain plants. Some others are prepared by mixing chemicals with other substances. Once the person who consumes it gets addicted, long-lasting effects begin to manifest.Ganja and CannabisCannabis plants flower and buds are used to prepare ganja. The plants buds and flower are used to prepare a substance that has the appearance of an adhesive. This is called charras. The powder prepared from the extracts of buds and flower is called brown sugar though its colour is white. Heroin is another type of brown sugar.Cocaine is a white coloured powder prepared from the extracts of coca plants and leaves. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is typically either swallowed or held under the tongue. It is often sold on blotter paper, a sugar cube, or gelatin. MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is prepared by adding several other chemicals to a substance.OpiumOpium is another drug prepared from the extracts of poppy leaves. Ketamine is a type of chemical and many other substances are added to prepare a drug for consumption.The police have categoried LSD, MDMA and Ketamine as party drugs since they are used by many in parties organised at reputed hotels and joints on the citys outskirts. They are also termed as executive drugs as they are prohibitively expensive. Other drugs such as cocaine, heroin, opium, brown sugar, hashish, charras are classified below executive drugs. These are mostly preferred by college students and professionals.Ganja is at the bottom of the list, is often treated as an ordinary drug available at cheaper prices. All these drugs are sold discreetly in the city in the form of oil, powder, crystal or adhesive. Some are injected directly into the bloodstream, others are orally consumed and some others are inhaled."

When Opposition members suggested that no minister even went to the protest venue, Minister for Co-operation H S Mahadeva Prasad said that he and Home Minister G Parameshwara had tried to defuse the situation.There are two sets of agitating farmers. While sugar cane growers are protesting near the Freedom Park, farmers from Kolar and Chikkaballpur are agitating near Mehkri Circle. While the Home Minister has met the farmers who are demanding permanent irrigation, I met the sugar cane growers. I have assured them that their problems will be resolved, Prasad said.But Shettar remained unconvinced. Merely going and meeting them will not help the matters. Why werent the farmers allowed to protest at the Freedom Park when it has been built for the very purpose. They have travelled a long distance. Where else should they protest? The government may as well shift the Freedom Park outside of the City, he said.When Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri of the BJP sought to know whether the police had caned the protesters near Windsor Manor, there was no reply from the government. JD(S) leaderH D Kumaraswamy, who kept off legislature, told reporters that the government must have allowed farmers into the City to avoid problems.

During the prime ministers visit, we will explain to him about farmers plight and urge him to introduce new norms for borrowing loans he said.According to available statistics, at present only 47 per cent of farmers in the country are eligible to enjoy government benefits, including loans and subsidies. The remaining 53 per cent are dependent on moneylenders. The suicide rate is high among such farmers, he said and demanded waiver of loans.

(Source: Express File) Akhil Kumar last represented India at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, where he lost in the pre-quarterfinals. (Source: Express File)More than two decades ago, when a young Akhil Kumar started boxing in his hometown Rohtak, he would spend a lot of time collecting cassettes and managing recordings of professional boxers like Sugar Ray Leonard, Roy Jones Jr and Prince Naseem Hamed. And thats what Akhil has been discussing with fellow boxer and Beijing Olympics quarter-finalist Jitender Kumar for the last six months or so.With his plans for qualifying for Rio Olympics going awry after suffering a ligament tear in November last year, it was a period which saw Akhil resuming training once again after an injury.And on Tuesday, the 35-year-old announced he was turning professional along with Jitender as the duo confirmed their signing with IOS Entertainment, the same company which brought Beijing Olympics bronze medallist Vijender Singh into the professional fold.It was on my mind for the last three or four months and I would tell Jitu also to think about it. Its been a challenge every time I suffered an injury and resumed training. But boxing made me do it and thats what made me take this decision. I was keen to make the move after the AIBA decision to accept professional boxers. My wife, who is a coach now and had travelled with the Indian team to Rio and also to the professional qualifiers in Venezuela, would also tell me that I could have qualified for Rio too, shares Akhil, who first came into the national senior camp in 2001.With his last major tournament being the 2014 Asian Games, where he featured in the 60kg category, Akhil trained in Australia, Italy and the UK with an eye on the Rio Olympics qualifiers last year. But a ligament injury scuppered his chances. With Vijender turning professional last year, Akhil would also get offers from Vijenders promoter Neerav Tomar.It was on Tomars insistence that he had taken part in Fight Nights, a semi-professional boxing event in 2005, and Akhil knows that lasting longer fights will be key on the professional circuit. I have never thought about age being a factor. I remember getting cassettes and recordings of boxers like Sugar Ray, Ray Jones Jr. and Prince Naseem Hamed. What made them successful was footwork and stamina. When I made the decision to move to 60kg in 2014, I knew that stamina and determination will be my strength and that has still kept me in the game. Yes, missing the Rio qualifiers was a setback but I resumed training in May this year and trying something new is something which motivates me to start my professional career. Medals jitna ya harna alag bat hai, but boxing karta rahunga. And thats what I would tell Neerav, shared the veteran pugilist.Akhil still remembers facing Cuban professional boxer and Sydney and Athens Olympics gold medallist Guillermo Ortiz before the Athens Games, and marks him down as a boxer to follow.While the professional circuit has seen the return of boxers like Roy Jones Jr at the age of 46, Akhil believes he has the desire and the game plan to make an impact.I had faced Guillermo before the Athens Olympics in the test event and lost to him in the semi-finals. But he is still going strong in the professional circuit.Roy Jones Jr too made a comeback this year. The rounds will increase and there has to be some technical changes which I need to make, but boxing is boxing; mukke marne se zyada mukke khane ki taqat bhi honi chahiye yahan, adds Kumar.Coach Jaidev Bisht has seen Akhil from close quarters since his early days, and the national coach played a major role in Akhils return prior to the 2014 Asian Games, charting out a coaching and rehabilitation plan for the boxer.Willing to take blowsPeople talk about Akhils open stance, but his strength all these years has also been the will to take the blows and determination to fight. And thats what will help him on the professional circuit. It is his will power that has seen him training again after the ligament injury he suffered in November last year and he wanted to give it a go. Training has been the key and he has been doing it for the last six months. Initially, I would say he needs to show patience to settle in the professional circuit and see how the body responds. He has the stamina to fight for four or five or even more rounds, and spending time in the professional set-up will only help him, shared Bisht.Ask Akhil about the favourite memories of his amateur career and he replies without hesitation.Of course, the win over world champion Sergey Vodjopyanov in Beijing. He was unbeaten for two years and I defeated him. That win is worth more than a medal for me. I dont know what lies ahead for me on the professional circuit but these lines by Atal Bihari Vajpayee are something which I believe in. Manzil milein na milein, ye alag baat hai, hum koshish hi na karen, yeh galat baat hai, he concludes.Pro Move1. Known for his open-guarded boxing style, Akhil Kumar shot into prominence with a gold medal at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games in the 54kg bantamweight category.2. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Akhil defeated reigning world champion Sergey Vodopyanov in the Round of 16 before losing in the quarter-finals.3. At the 2008 AIBA World Cup in Moscow, Akhil won a bronze medal after reaching the semi-finals.4. Jitender Kumar won a bronze medal at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games after reaching the semi-finals, where he lost to eventual gold medallist Don Broadhurst of England.5. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he won his first two bouts convincingly, before losing to Russias Georgy Balakshin, a fight during which he had nine stitches in his jaw.6. Akhil, Jitender and Vijender Kumar were the boxing triumvirate who were all medal prospects at Beijing 2008. However, only Vijender managed to reach the podium by winning a bronze medal, with the other two missing out narrowly.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

A pair of sugarcane is selling at Rs 100-120, while last year it cost Rs 80-90.Selling sugarcane during the festival and to factories is our only source of income. The rates have increased compared to last year and people are bargaining, but we cannot do anything, said Dasappa, a farmer and retailer. Much of the sugarcane sold in the City is brought from Mandya, Ramanagar and Mysuru, which is of lesser quality. The sweeter variety is produced more in Belagavi and Bidar, but by the time it is brought to Bengaluru, the juice dries up, said Kariyappa, a retailer.There has been a 23 per cent reduction in cane production compared to the previous year. Last year, the area under sugarcane cultivation was 5.05-5.10 lakh hectares, but this year it is five lakh hectares. During 2013-14, the yield was 3.83 crore metric tonnes and in 2014-15, it was 4.5 crore metric tonnes. This year, so far it has been only 1.49 crore metric tonnes.We are expecting it to increase, but so far it has been less. So, the rates have increased, said an official from the office of the Commissioner of Cane Development and Director of Sugar department.Another reason for the increase in prices is import and export factor, department commissioner M K Aiyappa pointed out. He said that now, according to central government rules, 10 per cent of the sugar produced has to be exported and the import duty has increased from 15 per cent to 40 per cent. It is also seen that the juice content in the cane is less because of drought and lack of water during cultivation. This has affected the prices, the officer said.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of the State Sugarcane Growers Association, said that the demand is more this festival, but supply less. The number of sugar factories has come down from 65 to 63 and the second generation farmers are not interested in cultivation. They are moving to the cities for different jobs, which has also affected rates.Farmers are yet to get their dues because of which they are showing less interest in sugarcane cultivation and are shifting to other cash crops, Shanthakumar said."
5923babb7be9e01fcef0576e,Kerala's 'fat tax' wakes up nation,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/562055/keralas-fat-tax-wakes-up.html,2016-08-03,"Kerala's 'fat tax' wakes up nationDevinder Sharma, Aug 04, 2016: 22:47 ISTIntroduce high level of tax on sugary drinks and junk foods, apart from a Swasth Bharat campaign nationwide.Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Issac has to be complimented for his pioneering effort to use the economic taxation policies to the ultimate benefit of human health. When he imposed the 14.5% tax on pizzas, burgers, and pastas served in branded restaurants, I was delighted.While the food industry, led by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has sought a review of the fat tax saying it would adversely affect growth of the quick service restaurant segment of the food industry and might set a similar trend for other segments as well, I dont think there is any need for the Kerala government to even take notice of the industrys representation. One of the main reasons behind the rising sales of junk food is because they are cheaper.I would like Thomas Issac to periodically raise the duties on junk foods, and also include sugary drinks in the tax net. The fat tax he introduced eventually must turn out to be a deterrent for the food industry. Childhood obesity has now reached serious proportion globally.We cannot be a helpless spectator and allow the food industry to play havoc with human health anymore. The United States National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) estimates more than 22 million children to be affected worldwide.Not only in children, obesity is also growing among the adults and that too at an alarming rate. Worldwide, 39% of the adults are over-weight, of which 13% are obese, and this is leading to the growth of lifestyle diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and blood pressure.If we take diabetes alone, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates show 422 million people suffered from the disease in 2014. This is roughly 8.5% of the global population. Of this, India also is home to 69 million diabetic patients, and the number is expected to swell to 100 million by 2030.Denmark started the trend in 2011 by imposing a tax on foods that contained more than 2.3% fat. Many countries have since introduced similar taxation measures with Mexico bringing in a sugar tax on sugary drinks, and Hungry has a tax on foods that contained high levels of sugar and salt. In April this year, UK has a sugar tax in a bid to curb growing obesity and diabetes. South Africa is also considering slapping a 20% tax on sugary beverages.Imposing additional taxes on sugary drinks and junk foods should help discourage the consumption of junk foods. This should however not be taken as a stand-alone measure. Fat tax should be accompanied by consumer awareness campaigns.The US first lady Michelle Obama perhaps sensed it early and soon after Barack Obama took over as US president, she launched a campaign on fighting junk food ads of sugary breakfast cereals, fast food and soft drinks aimed at school children.Five years after she launched a nationwide campaign called Lets Move!, the US Department of Agriculture last year phased out junk food advertisements from vending machines in schools across the country. Even billboards of Coke and Pepsi were removed from school eateries. The big retail giant Walmart has promised to reduce salt content in its products by 25% and sugar by 10%.Childhood obesity is known to be a huge problem in America with obesity rates among those between 2 and 19 years being as high as 17%. And it is here that Michelle Obamas campaign is slowly making an impact. At least obesity levels in children between the age of 2-5 are coming down in the US.Tax on soft drinksAlthough India is reportedly planning to bring in a tax on sugary beverages and soft drinks, any such measure draws a loud protest from the TV channels, which more or less have an allegiance to a business house. With industry bodies like Ficci and CII jumping saying it will hit industrial growth, the government normally goes on the back foot.But I see a possibility of a big national campaign, which will certainly leave behind a significant impact, if a campaign on the lines of popularising yoga is undertaken by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He is already seeking the application of yoga for reducing diabetes; cracking down on the consumption of junk foods and sugary drinks in a Swasth Bharat campaign only completes his mission.Keralas fat tax has certainly woken up the nation to the need for stringent measures to control the growing threat of diabetes and other lifestyle diseases. I propose two action points: First, is to introduce a high level of tax on sugary drinks, including colas, and junk foods. This must be accompanied by a nationwide Swasth Bharat campaign, which should also aim at looking afresh at some of the policy decisions.For example, 100 per FDI in processing industry should not be allowed in foods which contain more salt and sugar. Breakfast cereals, like cornflakes and its variants, are more of a desert than healthy foods. Safe food standards must be laid down by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) which the manufacturer and retail trade must be asked to comply with."
5923bc047be9e01fcef05835,Redressal policy for water dispute hazy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/553627/redressal-policy-water-dispute-hazy.html,2016-06-21,"Redressal policy for water dispute hazyBy Bhaskar Parichha, Jun 22, 2016, DHNS 0:28 ISTExperts feel the need for an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in India.As recent as in March, the National thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had to shut down its 2100 MW capacity power plant in West Bengal because it hadnt enough water to be used as coolant for the equipment.The level in the Farakka feeder canal which supplies water to the thermal plant had shrunk to hopeless levels. That was also the reason why electricity supply to five states was disrupted and some 40,000 families had to remain without power for days together.Drinking water was in short supply in Farakka town. Plying of boats on river Ganga had to be suspended and around 13 barges carrying coal were stuck in the mid-river because of low levels of water. This demonstrates that the Ganges is drying up faster than estimated.According to different reports, in the last decade itself, water level in 91% of countrys water reservoirs has come down. The Central Water Commissions findings are even more frightening  only 29% of water is left behind against their carrying capacity. Whats more, ground water which is the major source 85%  of water in India is depleting endlessly.Across states in India, dependence on water tankers today is greater than before. Water-related scuffles nowadays are common place. Recently, in the villages of Latur district of Maharashtra, prohibitive orders had to be clamped. Water supply to swimming pools has been cut off in Maharashtra.According to NASA, the ground water level in India is diminishing by 0.3 metre annually. Paradoxically, when there is a severe shortage of water, farmers in desiccated areas are encouraged to produce water-guzzling sugar cane. Same is the case with wheat and rice which are water-intensive.On the other side of the spectrum, water disputes are constantly on the rise. In addition to the fact that there isnt enough water for irrigation because of the myopic policies of successive governments, water is causing bad blood among people. In Punjab, after the Sutlej link canal bill was passed in the assembly, fissures have surfaced between Haryana and Punjab over division of water. In Haryana, farmers owning agricultural fields are screaming for water.Of late, state after state seem to be relying on the principle of Harmon. State governments are fostering a gut feeling that they have full control over the water that flows down from the state line.In order to trim down water disputes between states, the Inter-State Water Dispute Act was enacted in 1956. But the water dispute tribunals have consistently failed to implement the accords reached between states.In as much as the tribunal doesnt have coercive powers and its judgments are not binding on the states, the pronoun-cements are flouted and states straightforwardly refuse to abide by the agreements reach-ed. Even the Centre is toothless, as it happened in the case of Ravi-Beas river water dispute.Institutional safeguardsIn reality, the water dispute redressal mechanism in India is a lot ambiguous, hazy and muddled. Those involved in the water row, time and again, has recourse to bullying. Resolution of water dispute is a hell of a job because of the sheer number of players  the Centre, the state governments, the water dispute tribunals, the civil society and so on. Even institutional safeguards meant for development and progress is becoming ineffective.Take for example, the Cauvery river water dispute. From 1968 to 1990, there were as many as 26 minister-level talks between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka; but there has been no answer to the row. Because of increasing politicisation, the Cauvery river dispute tribunals proposals have become some sort of a wild goose chase.Experts feel the increasing need of an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in the country. This Central regulatory body must know how to undertake water upkeep seriously. In the same way, we need a mechanism to share our water in the best possible way keeping in mind the social equity, need and lots of common wisdom.Industries, farmers and the common citizenry should be the partners in any talk of water distribution and conservation. We also need a couple of new laws and make stronger the present ones to maintain the ecological balance of Indias rivers. A new law to maintain minimum levels of water too is considered necessary. Politicisation of water is the last thing to be wished.All that is looked for is an attitudinal change among stakeholders. A long time solution to Indias water problem is enormously significant and the sooner we find an answer to the vexing problem of depleting water sources and the corresponding feuds the better. Water is one commodity which can never be put to buy and sell. Commercialisation of water can happen only in the depths of despair."

He was very corrupt and very open about it. After hearing endless stories about bribes given for contracts and payments received for projects that were never finished, I asked why was he so open about all this stealing.He was a bit puzzled. Why do you call it theft? he asked. Look, the state is like our mother, and surely everyone takes something from their mother when she is not looking. Dont you? For Pakistans ruling elite, mother is never looking.In the wake of the Panama Papers leak, this country, like many others, is consumed by a debate over corruption. People accused of owning offshore companies include our prime ministers children, senior opposition politicians, a media tycoon, two judges and about 400 businesspeople.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was in prison for 14 months and spent eight years in exile, but that didnt stop his family empire from expanding and running sugar mills and poultry farms. To clear his name after the Panama Papers story broke, he promptly went on the air and in a whiny speech recounted all the sacrifices his family has made for the country and how their business has suffered.Sharifs spin masters reminded us that the allegations werent about the prime minister but about his children. They reminded us that owning an offshore company is not illegal. Maybe its unethical, they conceded, but you can see this country doesnt really protect its rich, so what were they to do?This might have stayed a mere debate if Pakistans army chief, General Raheel Sharif (not even remotely related to Sharif), hadnt then sacked six senior army officers, including two generals, on charges of smuggling and other forms of corruption. One of the generals was accused of getting two officers killed while test-driving a smuggled Nissan Fairlady.It turns out that some of those army officers were actually sa-cked last year without facing a military court, and that they will continue to receive pensions and medical benefits. But never mi-nd that. The timing of the armys public announcement sent a clear message: We dont tolerate corruption in our ranks; civilian governments shouldnt either.Now the opposition parties want the prime ministers family business to be investigated. And the prime minister wants everyone to be investigated. Our national discussion about corruption is starting to sound like an argument among a bunch of thieves, with some saying to others, You have stolen more, and the others saying, You get caught more often.We treat our politicians like criminals, and some of them become criminals. In an age-old tradition, many working criminals also turn to politics to prot-ect and multiply their assets. Former president Asif Ali Zard-ari spent 11 years in prison on charges of corruption without ever being sentenced in a single case. None knows how he came to own a country estate in En-gland and a chateau in France.History on plunderThere is no public debate about the armys financial affairs because we treat our generals like conquering heroes. But conquering heroes take what they think is theirs, and even while fighting very long wars inside and outside Pakistans borders, the armed forces have managed to deal in real estate, make ferti-lisers, run bakeries and sell bre-akfast cereals. All these activities are legal, because at one point a military dictator or a weak civilian leader sanctioned them.Pakistans history is so intertwined with plunder that some older Pakistanis who lived through the partition of India in 1947 dont call it partition or freedom: They refer to it as the time of lut, Punjabi for loot. The migrations and massacres of the day were accompanied by mass plundering of the evacuees properties, and many fortunes were made through false claims.Take Islamabad. Its not the first capital of a country to be built on plunder, but it must be one of the prettiest that was built entirely on plunder. Half a century ago, our generals, politicians and bureaucrats picked a scenic spot, allotted lands to one another, built on them and then sold the properties to the next generation. One of the poshest areas in Islamabad was meant for working farmers. Today, its nothing but swanky mansions with acres of manicured lawns. Many of those who lecture us about corruption live there.Politicians, generals and bureaucrats arent the only ones who think the state owes them a mansion and a manicured lawn. In many cities, journalists have been promised, and in some cases given, subsidised plots in housing colonies.I asked a fellow journalist who is lobbying to get one of those, If its wrong for politicians and generals to get free plots, how is it right for journalists? Its people like you who are holding us back, he told me. No surprise, then, that its rare to read an article or see a news report about the millions of Pakistanis who live in slums or are struggling for land rights.I am a proud member of Kar-achis Arts Council, an organisation of artists of all varieties, mostly poets. Before every ann-ual election, the candidates for the councils executive body promise us that the council will continue its efforts to get us residential plots somewhere. Even those of us who look at the stars keep one eye on mothers purse."

Our ancestors were hunter gatherers. However, hunting did not guarantee food on a day-to-day basis.Episodes of famine and hunger occurred between periods of food in plenty. Our ancestors learned to store the food. Not just in their dwellings, though. Their bodies also stored calories  especially as energy in the abdominal fat tissue.Later, during periods of hunger, this fat would be used up to create energy for the body. Though our ancestors did not know it, this adaptation would be one of several Darwinian processes ensuring that humans may be naturally selected for the future. It is, of course, all about the survival of the fittest  but are we the fittest anymore?Alas, after all these years, it seems that the body has still not unlearnt its tendency to hoard. For, despite food that exists in plentiful today, the body continues to store a significant portion of it as abdominal fat. This maladaptation, also called the th-rifty gene theory, has been most marked in societies that have prospered with greater rapidity.An example is the increase of abdominal obesity in economies like India  where the body has not had time to adjust itself to the increased availability of food, coupled with a decreased need to perform strenuous tasks.Welcome, then, to the world of abdominal obesity which, researchers feel, is one of the many reasons to explain the common occurrence of diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease. Like for any disease, this theory, based on evolution, is not an only explanation; poor nutrition of pregnant mothers, hereditary factors and pollutants have all been invoked to explain the rising occurrence of diabetes and its complications in our midst.Diabetes is a state of high blood glucose (also referred to as blood sugar) level. India has about 68 million people with diabetes. Untreated, diabetes can damage the blood vessels leading to blindness, foot amputations, kidney failure and heart attacks. What is more, diabetes occurs a decade earlier in Indians, as compared to their Western counterparts.In a developing country like ours, the social, economic and health-related consequences of such a disease may be catastrophic. How can a disease that is so common, and yet so serious, be prevented? Well, it turns out that the ways to prevention are as simple as they are complex.Treating diabetes is no easy task. Diet and physical activity remain the fundamental treatment. Pills mainly act by improving insulin and its action. Insulin is a natural hormone produced by the body to lower blood glucose levels. In more difficult cases, insulin is given by injection. Insulin cannot be taken orally, it gets digested.Newer medications which throw out glucose through the urine, among others, are expensive and of limited safety. A group of surgeons advocate abdominal surgery (called bari-atric surgery) to cure diabetes in the obese. There are, in addition to all this, other alternative treatments which are of questionable long term benefit.Diabetes educationTo help the patient and the physician through the maze of diabetes-related illnesses and therapies, we require a new idea. No, it is not the magic pill or the latest insulin pump or even the artificial insulin producing machine which scientists have been promising. It is a simpler, yet more powerful idea  it is called Diabetes Education.The need is to educate healthcare providers to tackle the disease with lifestyle modifications and existing medication which are available and effective. Public private partnerships like the Public Health Foundation of Indias (PHFI) certificate courses in evidence-based diabetes management, both in their basic and advanced versions, are helping fulfil this need.Simultaneously, it is important to improve patient awareness about lifestyle changes, glucose monitoring, appropriate detection of complications and pills/ injections. It is rightly said that to know diabetes is to say no to diabetes.Developing a new cadre of diabetes educators, by training paramedical professional in rural and urban India, is vital.

5923d9407be9e01fcef06fa4,"Muhammad Ali, who riveted the world as 'The Greatest,' dies",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/550467/muhammad-ali-riveted-world-greatest.html,2016-06-04,"Muhammad Ali, who riveted the world as 'The Greatest,' diesPhoenix, Jun 4, 2016, AP: 14:18 ISTHe was fast of fist and foot -- lip, too -- a heavyweight champion who promised to shock the world and did. He floated. He stung. Mostly he thrilled, even after the punches had taken their toll and his voice barely rose above a whisper.He was The Greatest. Muhammad Ali died Friday at age 74, according to a statement from the family. He was hospitalized in the Phoenix area with respiratory problems earlier this week, and his children gathered around him.With a wit as sharp as the punches he used to ""whup"" opponents, Ali dominated sports for two decades before time and Parkinson's Syndrome, triggered by thousands of blows to the head, ravaged his magnificent body, muted his majestic voice and ended his storied career in 1981.He won and defended the heavyweight championship in epic fights in exotic locations, spoke loudly on behalf of blacks, and famously refused to be drafted into the Army during the Vietnam War because of his Muslim beliefs.Despite his debilitating illness, he traveled the world to rapturous receptions even after his once-bellowing voice was quieted and he was left to communicate with a wink or a weak smile.Revered by millions worldwide and reviled by millions more, Ali cut quite a figure, 6 feet 3 and 210 pounds in his prime. ""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,"" his cornermen exhorted, and he did just that in a way no heavyweight had ever fought before.He fought in three different decades, finished with a record of 56-5 with 37 knockouts and was the first man to win heavyweight titles three times.He whipped the fearsome Sonny Liston twice, toppled the mighty George Foreman with the rope-a-dope in Zaire, and nearly fought to the death with Joe Frazier in the Philippines. Through it all, he was trailed by a colorful entourage who merely added to his growing legend.""Rumble, young man, rumble,"" cornerman Bundini Brown would yell to him. And rumble Ali did. He fought anyone who meant anything and made millions of dollars with his lightning-quick jab. His fights were so memorable that they had names  ""Rumble in the Jungle"" and ""Thrilla in Manila.""But it was as much his antics -- and his mouth -- outside the ring that transformed the man born Cassius Clay into a household name as Muhammad Ali.""I am the greatest,"" Ali thundered again and again. Few would disagree.Ali spurned white America when he joined the Black Muslims and changed his name. He defied the draft at the height of the Vietnam war -- ""I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong"" -- and lost 3 1/2 years from the prime of his career. He entertained world leaders, once telling Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos: ""I saw your wife. You're not as dumb as you look.""He later embarked on a second career as a missionary for Islam. ""Boxing was my field mission, the first part of my life,"" he said in 1990, adding with typical braggadocio, ""I will be the greatest evangelist ever.""Ali couldn't fulfill that goal because Parkinson's robbed him of his speech. It took such a toll on his body that the sight of him in his later years -- trembling, his face frozen, the man who invented the Ali Shuffle now barely able to walk -- shocked and saddened those who remembered him in his prime.The quiet of Ali's later life was in contrast to the roar of a career that had breathtaking highs as well as terrible lows. He exploded on the public scene with a series of nationally televised fights that gave the public an exciting new champion, and he entertained millions as he sparred verbally with the likes of bombastic sportscaster Howard Cosell.Ali once calculated he had taken 29,000 punches to the head and made $57 million in his pro career, but the effect of the punches lingered long after most of the money was gone. That didn't stop him from traveling tirelessly to promote Islam, meet with world leaders and champion legislation dubbed the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act. While slowed in recent years, he still managed to make numerous appearances, including a trip to the 2012 London Olympics.Despised by some for his outspoken beliefs and refusal to serve in the U.S. Army in the 1960s, an aging Ali became a poignant figure whose mere presence at a sporting event would draw long standing ovations.With his hands trembling so uncontrollably that the world held its breath, he lit the Olympic torch for the 1996 Atlanta Games in a performance as riveting as some of his fights. A few years after that, he sat mute in a committee room in Washington, his mere presence enough to convince lawmakers to pass the boxing reform bill that bore his name.Members of his inner circle weren't surprised. They had long known Ali as a humanitarian who once wouldn't think twice about getting in his car and driving hours to visit a terminally ill child. They saw him as a man who seemed to like everyone he met -- even his archrival Frazier.One of his biggest opponents would later become a big fan, too. On the eve of the 35th anniversary of their ""Rumble in the Jungle,"" Foreman paid tribute to the man who so famously stopped him in the eighth round of their 1974 heavyweight title fight, the first ever held in Africa.Born Cassius Marcellus Clay on Jan. 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali began boxing at age 12 after his new bicycle was stolen and he vowed to policeman Joe Martin that he would ""whup"" the person who took it.He was only 89 pounds at the time, but Martin began training him at his boxing gym, the beginning of a six-year amateur career that ended with the light heavyweight Olympic gold medal in 1960.Ali had already encountered racism. On boxing trips, he and his amateur teammates would have to stay in the car while Martin bought them hamburgers.When he returned to Louisville with his gold medal, the Chamber of Commerce presented him a citation but said it didn't have time to co-sponsor a dinner.In his autobiography, ""The Greatest,"" Ali wrote that he tossed the medal into the Ohio River after a fight with a white motorcycle gang, which started when he and a friend were refused service at a Louisville restaurant.The story may be apocryphal, and Ali later told friends he simply misplaced the medal. Regardless, he had made his point. After he beat Liston to win the heavyweight title in 1964, Ali shocked the boxing world by announcing he was a member of the Black Muslims -- the Nation of Islam -- and was rejecting his ""slave name.""As a Baptist youth he spent much of his time outside the ring reading the Bible. From now on, he would be known as Muhammad Ali and his book of choice would be the Koran. Ali's affiliation with the Nation of Islam outraged and disturbed many white Americans, but it was his refusal to be inducted into the Army that angered them most.That happened on April 28, 1967, a month after he knocked out Zora Folley in seventh round at Madison Square Garden in New York for his eighth title defense. He was convicted of draft evasion, stripped of his title and banned from boxing. Ali appealed the conviction on grounds he was a Muslim minister.He married 17-year-old Belinda Boyd, the second of his four wives, a month after his conviction, and had four children with her. He had two more with his third wife, Veronica Porsche, and he and his fourth wife, Lonnie Williams, adopted a son.During his banishment, Ali spoke at colleges and briefly appeared in a Broadway musical called ""Big Time Buck White."" Still facing a prison term, he was allowed to resume boxing three years later, and he came back to stop Jerry Quarry in three rounds on Oct. 26, 1970, in Atlanta despite efforts by Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox to block the bout.He was still facing a possible prison sentence when he fought Frazier for the first time on March 8, 1971, in what was labeled ""The Fight of the Century.""A few months later the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction on an 8-0 vote.Many in boxing believe Ali was never the same fighter after his lengthy layoff, even though he won the heavyweight championship two more times and fought for another decade. Perhaps his most memorable fight was the ""Rumble in the Jungle,"" when he upset a brooding Foreman to become heavyweight champion once again at age 32.Many worried that Ali could be seriously hurt by the powerful Foreman, who had knocked Frazier down six times in a second round TKO.But while his peak fighting days may have been over, he was still in fine form verbally. He promoted the fight relentlessly, as only he could.""You think the world was shocked when Nixon resigned,"" he said. ""Wait till I whup George Foreman's behind.""Ali won over a country before he won the fight, mingling with people as he trained and displaying the kind of playful charm the rest of the world had already seen. On the plane into the former Congo he asked what the citizens of Zaire disliked most. He was told it was Belgians because they had once colonized the country.""George Foreman is a Belgian,"" Ali cried out to the huge crowd that greeted him at the airport. By the time the fight finally went off in the early morning hours of Oct. 30, 1974, Zaire was his.""Ali booma-ya (Ali kill him),"" many of the 60,000 fans screamed as the fight began in Kinshasa.Ali pulled out a huge upset to win the heavyweight title for a second time, allowing Foreman to punch himself out. He used what he would later call the ""rope-a-dope"" strategy -- something even trainer Angelo Dundee knew nothing about.Finally, he knocked out an exhausted Foreman in the eighth round, touching off wild celebrations among his African fans. ""I told you I was the greatest,"" Ali said.That might have been argued by followers of Joe Louis or Rocky Marciano or Sugar Ray Robinson, but there was no doubt that Ali was just what boxing needed in the early 1960s. He spouted poetry and brash predictions. After the sullen and frightening Liston, he was a fresh and entertaining face in a sport that struggled for respectability.At the weigh-in before his Feb. 25, 1964, fight with Liston, Ali carried on so much that some observers thought he was scared stiff and suggested the fight in Miami Beach be called off. Ali went on to punch Liston's face lumpy and became champion for the first time when Liston quit on his stool after the sixth round.""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,"" became Ali's rallying cry.His talent for talking earned him the nickname ""The Louisville Lip,"" but he had a new name of his own in mind: Muhammad Ali. ""I don't have to be what you want me to be,"" he told reporters the morning after beating Liston. ""I'm free to be who I want.""Frazier refused to call Ali by his new name, insisting he was still Cassius Clay. So did Ernie Terrell in their Feb. 6, 1967, fight, a mistake he would come to regret through 15 long rounds. ""What's my name?"" Ali demanded as he repeatedly punched Terrell in the face. ""What's my name?""By the time Ali was able to return to the ring following his forced layoff, he was bigger than ever. Soon he was in the ring for his first of three epic fights against Frazier, with each fighter guaranteed $2.5 million.In the first fight, though, Frazier had the upper hand. He relentlessly wore Ali down, flooring him with a crushing left hook in the 15th round and winning a decision.It was the first defeat for Ali, but the boxing world had not seen the last of him and Frazier in the ring. Ali won a second fight, and then came the ""Thrilla in Manila"" on Oct. 1, 1975, in the Philippines, a brutal bout that Ali said afterward was ""the closest thing to dying"" he had experienced.Ali won that third fight but took a terrific beating from the relentless Frazier before trainer Eddie Futch kept Frazier from answering the bell for the 15th round.""They told me Joe Frazier was through,"" Ali told Frazier at one point during the fight. ""They lied,"" Frazier said, before hitting Ali with a left hook.The fight -- which most in boxing agree was Ali's last great performance -- was part of a 16-month period on the mid-1970s when Ali took his show on the road, fighting Foreman in Zaire, Frazier in the Philippines, Joe Bugner in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Jean Pierre Coopman in Puerto Rico. The world got a taste of Ali in splendid form with both his fists and his mouth.In Malaysia, a member of the commission in charge of the gloves the fighters would wear told Ali they would be held in a prison for safekeeping before the fight.""My gloves are going to jail,"" shouted a wide-eyed Ali. ""They ain't done nothing -- yet!""Ali would go on to lose the title to Leon Spinks, then come back to win it a third time on Sept. 15, 1978, when he scored a decision over Spinks in a rematch before 70,000 people at the Superdome in New Orleans.Ali retired, only to come back and try to win the title for a fourth time against Larry Holmes on Oct. 2, 1980, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Ali grew a mustache, pronounced himself ""Dark Gable"" and got down to a svelte 217 1/2 pounds to beat Father Time. But Holmes, his former sparring partner, mercifully toyed with him until Dundee refused to let Ali answer the bell for the 11th round.When the fight was over, Holmes and his wife went upstairs to pay their respects to Ali. In a darkened room, Holmes told Ali that he loved him. A few years later, Ali said he would not have fought Holmes if he didn't think he could have won.""If I had known Holmes was going to whip me and damage my brain, I would not have fought him,"" Ali said. ""But losing to Holmes and being sick are not important in God's world.""It was that world that Ali retreated to, fighting just once more, losing a 10-round decision to Trevor Berbick in the Bahamas.With his fourth wife, Lonnie, at his side, Ali traveled the world for Islam and other causes. In 1990, he went to Iraq on his own initiative to meet with Saddam Hussein and returned to the United States with 15 Americans who had been held hostage.For his part, Ali didn't complain about the price he had paid in the ring. ""What I suffered physically was worth what I've accomplished in life,"" he said in 1984. ""A man who is not courageous enough to take risks will never accomplish anything in life."""

Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur are the three venues in Maharashtra scheduled to hold the IPL matches.Maharashtra -- home to Rising Pune Supergiants and Mumbai Indians -- was to host 13 games after April 30, including the final in Mumbai.""Organising the IPL is a gigantic work. It's not easy. All preparations had been done, completed. Now shifting the matches will be a problem,"" Shukla told 'India Today'.""So far, we have not got the written order, after we get that, we will work out an alternative plan. We always respect the court. We need to talk to other franchises. Out of 19 matches in Maharashtra, 13 have to be moved out, we will have to work it out,"" he added.The BCCI had offered to contribute to Chief Minister's drought relief fund besides supplying water to the drought-affected areas. Shukla said the Board could not have done anything more than that.""The key problem is water for farmers, which we are trying to find a solution to. We were willing to give water, contribute to the CM's fund. Now shifting matches will be a problem,"" Shukla said.""If matches are to be shifted, where will they be moved, how will they be moved, all these issues are involved. And this comes after nobody raised an issue about the 24 World Twenty20 matches that were held recently,"" he said.""Nobody raised these issues for six months. Whatever was required, we were willing to do. In fact, I would like to point out that a lot many other sports and cultural events are going on in Maharashtra, which also use water and they should also help,"" he added.Shukla said even the sugar factories and golf courses should be pulled up for their water usage.""Not only sugar factories, construction should also be stopped. All golf courses, they require huge amount of water, nothing is being done against these golf courses,"" he said.Kings XI Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia, who was among the first to advocate shifting of matches, said he is glad that sensitivities of the drought-affected people in Maharashtra are being respected.""Maharashtra has been under drought.

He first clarified that he does not intend to sell one of his kidneys and ""his spur of the moment"" remark was blown out of proportion.But later in the day, he told PTI that he indeed had seen a doctor to inquire about a surgery on his kidney.""I did give it (selling kidney) a serious thought. I went to a doctor in Lucknow and he told me that I could play with one kidney five to six months after operation. I still have no sponsors so I hope something happens soon. I wrote Rs 8 lakh as the price for my kidney as the annual budget for touring is Rs 12 lakh,"" Dixit said when contacted.""I was feeling really low and that is why I posted that (deleted now). I realise it was not the right thing to do. I will continue looking for sponsors,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Dixit, a former Asian junior champion, apologised for the turn of events.""I did not realise there is so much to be read into this until I received a call from a reporter,"" said 23-year-old Dixit who is part of Indian team for next month's South Asian Games.In a hand written letter to the president of Squash Rackets Federation of India (SRF), Dixit said he would continue playing the game.""Squash is my life and I wish to continue playing it. I am keen to pursue the game as my career and would continuously look for sponsors. I never intended to sell my kidney and it was a spur of the moment statement for which I am sorry. I apologise to my family and the people who have supported me,"" Dixit said.India's top male squash player Saurav Ghosal too was shocked at Dixit's comments.""I have interacted with him many times and to be honest, I never thought the situation was so extreme (that he would think of selling his kidney). I have not spoken to him, I have only read his comments in the media. It is unfortunate if he thought to do something like that. I am sure there are better ways to fund your career,"" Ghosal told PTI.SRFI chief Debendranath Sarangi, in a statement, said Dixit has been with the Indian Squash Academy (ISA) in Chennai for nine years and has been staying and training there.""The ISA and SRFI provide him financial assistance for participation in the national/international tournaments, in addition to the funding from sports ministry and Dhampur Sugar Mills.

5923f7317be9e01fcef086bb,Drought may reduce state's food grain output by 15%,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/574926/drought-may-reduce-states-food.html,2016-10-09,"Drought may reduce state's food grain output by 15%Asha Krishnaswamy, October 09, 2016, Bengaluru, DHNS 1:39 ISTRain deficit in August, September ranged from 31-39%With parts of 110 taluks of the total 177 reeling under drought, Karnataka is set to see a considerable reduction in food grain production.The food grain target for the state during 2016-17 has been fixed at around 140 lakh metric tonnes (MT). The target for the kharif season, from mid-May to mid-October, has been put at 101 lakh MT, while for the rabi season, from mid-October to December-end, it is 38 lakh MT.A conservative estimate projects the output reduction in the range of 10 to 15% of the target, according to official sources.With the south-west monsoon disappointing farmers in August and September, agricultural enterprise has taken a nosedive. But two districts which are an exception to this are Bidar and Kalaburagi. These two districts received heavy rains due to the cyclonic effect. Standing crops in vast tracts of land were washed away due to the flash floods.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, in June, had announced that normal monsoon, as predicted, would enable farmers to commence early preparation of their land for sowing. In 2015-16, the food grain production was 110 lakh MT, owing to drought in 137 taluks, he had pointed out.Severe crisisAll the calculations of the agriculture department have gone haywire due to severe paucity of rains. This is more so in Mandya, Mysuru, Hassan, Tumakuru, Ramanagaram, Chikkaballapur, Kolar, Chitradurga, Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts. These districts contribute mainly to the kharif production which includes paddy, ragi, jowar, maize, bajra, besides cash crops. Nearly 70% of the food grain production is during the Kharif period.The state, as a whole, is facing rain deficit of 18%, which is considered normal. But crop loss is also taken into consideration for assessing drought. Agriculture activities suffered in August and September, with rain deficit ranging from 31 to 39% in the state. The dry spell in these months continued for more than 45 days, the official sources said.To a question whether the state has kept an unreasonable target to achieve 140 lakh MT this year, the sources said the target was fixed going by the production in 2013-14. The target was 130 lakh MT, but the production was 133.10 lakh MT then.Consecutive droughtsThe state, over the years, has been facing difficulty in meeting the food grain target, because of consecutive droughts. For example, in 2012-13, 157 taluks were declared drought-hit. The food grain target was 137 lakh MT, while the production was nearly 109 lakh MT. One of the worst drought years was 2002-03 and the food grain production had dipped to 66 lakh MT against the target of 90 lakh MT.It was in August this year that the government realised that the south-west monsoon would be below normal.It suggested farmers to go for semi-dry crops, instead of water-intensive crops such as paddy or sugar cane. But by then, sowing activities were almost complete, the sources said.Dryland farmers worst-hitDr Subramanya, retired IAS officer, said dryland farmers are the worst-affected whenever there is drought. The income of farmers, especially small and marginal, reduces drastically. To have cash on hand, farmers raise non-institutional loans and get trapped in debt.However, he said, reduction in production would not lead to non-availability of grains in the market. When we take India as a unit, food grain availability will be balanced. The country also imports food grains whenever there is a shortage, he added."

However, the government will wait for the next 15 days to see whether the state receives good rains and later declare all taluks as drought affected, he said.To discourage cultivation of water-intensive crops like sugar cane and paddy, the government has planned to give importance to millets.At present, a support price of Rs 1,600 has been announced for ragi and jowar and they have been included under the PDS. To encourage farmers to opt for millets, the government has submitted a proposal to the Union government, asking it to enhance the support price to Rs 2,100 for millet. This was the only solution to discourage cultivation of water-intensive crops, the minister said.On announcing support price for onion, Gowda said, the matter had been placed before the Cabinet sub-committee and in principle, it had been decided to announce Rs 1,100 per quintal. The Centre had been urged to intervene in the market to uphold the interests of the farmers. A reply from the Union Agriculture Ministry is expected to reach the government in a weeks time, he said.State team to meet Union agri ministerRevenue Minister Kagodu Thimmappa said on Monday that a delegation from the state government would approach the Centre next week, seeking funds to compensate farmers for the losses suffered due to drought, reports DHNS from Belagavi.

This year too, cane cultivation area is less because of water scarcity. The ripple effects of this will be seen next year also. It is natural that when production is limited, cost escalates.As per the CCDDS data, in 2014-15, sugar production in Karnataka was 49 lakh metric tonnes (MT) and in 2015-16, it was 40.05 lakh MT. This year, so far 30 lakh MT sugar has been produced. The total cane production in 2015-16 was 376 lakh MT against 300 lakh MT this year.Not encouragingPavan Kumar, SISMA president, said nationally there is a 20% reduction in cane production and 30% deficit in Karnataka.Maharashtra which meets 40% of the total needs of sugar is the largest producer, followed by Uttar Pradesh (30%) and Karnataka (25%). Tamil Nadu is gradually registering an increase in production, with a share of 6%.Though cane is an annual crop, its maturity time is October and November. If there are good rains, standing crops absorb water, which will increase the thickness of the stem, making it sweeter and profitable for the cane industry. But if that does not happen, there is further decline in sugar production, Kumar said."

The factories have come forward to fix Rs 3,000 per tonne of cane, he added.Last year, the Centre had fixed Rs 2,350 per tonne of cane, which is same this year too.

The panel had pointed out that sugarcane requires a large amount of water to cultivate.Of the 202 sugar mills in Maharashtra, 40 per cent are in Marathwada region. Maharashtra accounts for 32 per cent of the total sugar production in the country.It is virtually not possible to sanction new sugar mills for the next five years in Marathwada region, state Revenue and Agriculture Minister Eknath Khadse said.Share This Article Related Article A not-so-sweet propositionA not-so-sweet proposition Maharashtra set to ban sugarcane farming in drought zoneMaharashtra set to ban sugarcane farming in drought zone Upper dams to release water for drought-hit districts; cabinet meet in Sept in MarathwadaUpper dams to release water for drought-hit districts; cabinet meet in Sept in Marathwada Water crisis: Sugar factories blamedWater crisis: Sugar factories blamed Tackling Drought: Govt wants Marathwada to move away from water-guzzling caneTackling Drought: Govt wants Marathwada to move away from water-guzzling cane Sugarcane cultivation should be banned in Marathwada: Madhav ChitaleIn another decision meant to save water, the government plans to make drip irrigation compulsory for all sugar mills across the state. Data from the ministry of agriculture shows that only 20-25 per cent sugar mills have implemented drip irrigation. A majority of the sugar mills draw water from dams. But the dilemma for the government, officials said, is that sugarcane growers seek higher subsidy to implement drip irrigation.The government is now seeking the Israel governments expertise and trying to make drip irrigation a less expensive process.There cannot be any justification for allowing so many sugar mills in Marathwada. As a uniform rule, the government should ensure that any district with less than 700 mm rainfall should not be allowed sugarcane cultivation, Chitale had said.Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, too, had suggested that permission to set up sugar mills should not be given in drought-hit regions.Fadnavis also emphasised on a re-look at crop patterns according to soil heath and water availability in each region, to ensure that huge investments put in by farmers are commensurate with the yield.Osmanabad district collector Prashant Narnaware said, In my district, where the average rainfall is less than 450 mm, the Beyond Cane campaign has worked to the farmers advantage. Out of 48,000 hectares, 23,000 hectares will not grow sugarcane. The farmers are going for pulses which require less water, floriculture and horticulture with guidance from the agriculture ministry.WATCH NEWS PLAYLISTFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Of the total 47 tmcft of storage capacity in the Mahadayi reservoir, only 27 tmcft of water was being stored, he added.The Goa governments counsel said construction of over 10 lift irrigation projects and mini-dams along the Malaprabha river is the primary reason behind the poor flow of water to the Malaprabha reservoir.Besides, flow of water to the reservoir has also reduced over the years due to large number of farmers diverting water from the river for irrigation using pumpsets, he argued.Though the original command area for the Malaprabha reservoir was 1.61 lakh hectares, it has now gone up to 2.36 lakh hectares and sugar cane alone is being grown in 24,000 hectares, Nadakarni said.The counsel said diverting the Mahadayi to the Malaprabha reservoir would require construction of huge pump houses, which will lead to large-scale destruction of forests in the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats and will also hit the natural flow of the river.As Mahadayi gets water only during the monsoon, diversion of water from June to October, as suggested by Karnataka, would lead to water crisis in Goa.Besides, any diversion of water would hit the industries in Goa which draw around 9.37 tmcft of water, he added.Rejecting the Central Water Commission report, which said the total flow of water in Mahadayi is 199 tmcft a year, Nadakarni said the report was not prepared after a scientific study. The tribunal will hold the next hearing on July 18.DH News ServiceAgitation completes a year todayThe protest by farmers demanding implementation of Mahadayi project completes a year on Saturday. Protesters say that neither the state government nor the Centre had taken the issue seriously.
