It is anticipated that the sugar cane cultivation could come down by 50% this season due to shortage of water, he added."

He has urged the Centre to consider the report of the parliamentary sub-committee which has proposed to increase the pictorial warning up to 50 per cent.Stating that Karnataka had already witnessed several suicides by sugar cane growers and other farmers, Manju said more than 60,000 farmers in the state and over one lakh families were dependent on the tobacco industry for their livelihood.After the governments announcement, tobacco sales have plummeted. Further, an estimated 25% of illegal cigarettes are making their way into the Indian market, he said, adding that a delegation comprising MPs, MLAs and ministers would be taken to New Delhi shortly.Beedi workersThe Labour department has mandated tobacco manufacturers to supply tobacco leaves to beedi rollers.

Hence, we found a need to do it right on the spot when the woman comes for a routine checkup, he said.Such tests, when introduced across the country, can help identify GDM early, he said.The idea was proposed in 2000 to the Tamil Nadu government, which soon passed a government order making it mandatory. We found that close to 16 per cent women in Urban areas, 13 % in semi urban and 9 % in rural areas were suffering from gestational diabetes. We approached the government and sought that all pregnant women be screened. Come April, the Single step test to identify GDM would be made mandatory on a pilot basis in one of the districts in Madhya Pradesh."

The farmers were taken to KR Hospital and are stable now.Naganna from Muddahalli and Ravi from Haadya, both villages in Mysuru district, were among hundreds of farmers who were stopped by the police from marching towards the chief ministers residence.The Karnataka State Sugar cane Growers Association had called for besieging the residences of the chief minister, Revenue Minister V Srinivas Prasad and Sugar Minister H S Mahadev Prasad in Mysuru.Farmers of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts are angry as Bannari Amman Sugars Ltd had failed to pay them Rs 78 crore in arrears of fair and remunerative price (FRP) per tonne of sugar cane as agreed upon in January. Though the FRP was fixed at Rs 2,469 per tonne, farmers were paid just Rs 2,000.When farmers arrived to protest, DCP (Law and Order) H T Shekar told them about prohibitory orders within a 200-metre radius of the residences of the three VIPs.In no mood to move back, the farmers protested in the middle of Chaduranga Road off the chief ministers residence. Some of them even tried to break the security cordon.As police pushed them back, the two farmers collapsed in the melee. Fellow farmers rushed them towards a waiting ambulance.K Rameshwarappa, Senior Deputy Director, Food and Civil Supplies, then arrived at the spot and conveyed to the farmers a message from minister Prasad that the arrears would be paid at the earliest. But farmers called it hogwash.At a meeting later, Prasad directed the General Manager of Bannari Amman Sugars, Vedaswamy, to settle the arrears by March and pay each farmer Rs 469 on seniority basis in four instalments from February 16."

The initiative is being supported by the Asian Research and Training Institute for Skill Transfer (ARTIST), the World Diabetes Foundation (WDF) and the Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI).Addressing a press conference in the City, Dr Hema Divakar, chairperson, ARTIST, said that since there is lack of awareness about gestational diabetes in the country, the initiative will help educate masses about the health condition. She added that according to a recent study, 80 % of women did not have any clarity on what gestational diabetes is.Approximately 10 % of women, who get pregnant every year, develop diabetes during the gestation period. Of the three million women who develop GDM in five to ten years after pregnancy, 30 % have a tendency to develop Type 2 Diabetes. This is an alarming trend, which cannot be ignored,  she added.Not only does GDM affect the pregnant woman but it also puts the newborn at risk, she explained. Children born to mothers with GDM could be obese. They are also at a higher risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, she said.Those who have a minimal variation in sugar levels can be put on diet besides being offered a family counselling. However, for pregnant women with high sugar levels, insulin becomes necessary. As against normal cases where a women can gain up to 10-15 kgs, those with GDM should not gain more than 6 to 8 kgs, she added.Meanwhile, Dr Anil Kapur, member, Board of Directors, World Diabetes Foundation said that GDM levels can affect three generations. If a pregnant woman has diabetes, chances are high that the newborn also gets Type 2 Diabetes later in life. It is also possible that the womans mother had GDM which went undiagnosed, he said.Explaining how GDM also makes women more prone to cardiovascular diseases, he said: Most women who have suffered a heart attack before menopause would have had GDM which went undiagnosed.PlayA short play was staged on the occasion by doctors representing several forums to create awareness about the need to control obesity. Through the skit, doctors also sent out a message that regular exercise and healthy diet must be adopted."

A professor at the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) here has developed a technology to convert this water into nata de coco which is a chewy, jelly-like food product that can be served as biosweet in ice creams, fruit preparations like cocktails and salads.Prof B Narayanaswamy, who teaches agricultural microbiology, said the technique converts coconut water into nata de coco through solid fermentation by adding ingredients such as pure bacterial cellulose, sugar syrup and added natural flavour.Native flavour can be added to nata de coco to boost the sales. Non-food products can also be produced from coconut water, he said.Setting up a plant to process 100 litres of water requires an investment of Rs 5 lakh and the business can be expanded depending on the scope. Though people feel the product is not saleable in Karnataka, it is in demand in several West Asian countries which import it from the Philippines. Narayanaswamy said that a lack of awareness about nata de coco was the reason behind poor response. People dont know that it provides an exciting business opportunity, he said, ruefully. Jobless men can start the business as the raw materials are available free of charge because disposing them is a headache for mills and temples. The professor said that his two-decade-long effort in popularising the technique in Karnataka had evoked poor response as neither the government nor the temple managements wanted to adopt the technique to make byproducts and make money. He said he had met government officials, especially in the Muzrai Department, appealing them to set up coconut water-processing plants as temples generate 5,000-7,000 litre of coconut water but their response was discouraging.He said he was willing to guide if jobless people were ready to start nata de coco business."

When Opposition members suggested that no minister even went to the protest venue, Minister for Co-operation H S Mahadeva Prasad said that he and Home Minister G Parameshwara had tried to defuse the situation.There are two sets of agitating farmers. While sugar cane growers are protesting near the Freedom Park, farmers from Kolar and Chikkaballpur are agitating near Mekhri Circle. While the Home Minister has met the farmers who are demanding permanent irrigation, I met the sugar cane growers. I have assured them that their problems will be resolved, Prasad said.But Shettar remained unconvinced. Merely going and meeting them will not help the matters. Why werent the farmers allowed to protest at the Freedom Park when it has been built for the very purpose. They have travelled a long distance. Where else should they protest? The government may as well shift the Freedom Park outside of the City, he said.When Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri of the BJP sought to know whether the police had caned the protesters near Windsor Manor, there was no reply from the government.JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy, who kept off legislature, told reporters said that the government must have allowed farmers into the City to avoid problems. The government has no respect for farmers, he suggested."

However, there is some good news, too  the fruit will be much sweeter this summer.Grape production has come down by 15 to 20 per cent in the areas the fruit is grown in Bengaluru Rural such as Devanahalli, Doddaballapur, Nelamanagala and Hoskote, according to the Horticulture department officials.The area under grape cultivation has also reduced, say officials. Devanahalli and Doddaballapur, which register maximum grape cultivation, have seen a decline this year.Last year, the area under grape cultivation was 2,300 hectares in Devanahalli, but this year, it has come down to 2,150 hectares. In Doddaballapur, too, the area under cultivation has reduced from 80 acres to 15 acres, said a Bengaluru Rural Horticulture department official.The heavy November downpour destroyed seedless varieties of grapes, which are harvested only once a year. The area of cultivation has also come down as farmers indulged in growing vegetables such as pole beans, tomatoes and other leafy vegetables this year. They also grew guava and flowers, especially Marigold. In Doddaballapur, many farmers are a part of the mango cultivation and expansion programme and this has resulted in the reduction of the area under grape cultivation, the official added.Speaking to Deccan Herald, K M Parashivamurthy, Additional Director (Fruits and Floriculture), Horticulture Department, said the total area under grape cultivation in Karnataka is 20,000 hectares, of which 2,500 hectares is in Bengaluru Rural. The demand for wine grapes has increased because of the growing market for wine products. Farmers and wine companies have tie-ups, he added.Sweeter harvestS V Hittalmani, former additional director, Horticulture department, said the grape produce is sweeter this year due to the early onset of summer. Normally, grapes are grown in hot and dry regions. This time, because the heat was more, it has helped increase the sugar content in the fruit. As temperatures rise, the sweetness will also increase during the course of this summer, he said. Meanwhile, grape production has not taken a hit in north Karnataka regions such as Vijayapura, Bagalkot and Belagavi."

Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, vice president of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation said the High Court had, however, accepted the sugar millers petition challenging the stock limit.Earlier this month, the central government imposed a limit on the amount of sugar stock that can be held by millers. In view of sugar prices crossing Rs 40 per kg in retail, the central government decreed that millers should not hold over 37 per cent of their total sugar stock by the end of September. Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan had tweeted about this decision and the government resolution was issued later on. Stock limit has already been imposed on sugar traders and stockists.Watch What Else is Making newsDandegaonkar said around 55 mills had approached the High Court for a stay in the matter.These are the mills which have more sugar stock than the the approved limits imposed by the central government, he said. He also said that the mills have slightly higher proportions, like instead of 37 per cent many of the mills have around 41-45 per cent of sugar stock. Millers are ready to sell sugar, but there is hardly any demand from the market, he said.Earlier the Sugar Commissionerate had asked the Excise department to verify the sugar limit for individual mills. The food and civil supplies ministry had earlier asked for the stock positions of individual mills. A new survey will be done by the Excise department and the Sugar Commissionerate to get the September end stock positions. Action, if any, is to be taken by the district supplies officers later on.With a lean sugar season in the offing, mills have been reluctant to sell sugar in anticipation of better prices. Millers have also talked about low demand from markets which has subdued sales.Sugar Commissioner Dr Bipin Sharma said the mills should ensure they adhere to the sugar stock limits imposed by the central government at the earliest.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

AIIMS hospital in New Delhi.Dental health scenario in India is alarming and excessive consumption of sugary drinks and junk food is making matters worse as high sugar eating habit is causing addiction and dental ailments, doctors have cautioned.About 80-90 per cent of the adult population in the country suffers from mild gingivitis (gum disease), 60 per cent from moderate gingivitis and over 50 per cent people overall have dental caries.Consumption of aerated drinks and junk food high on sugar, makes people unwittingly addicted to sugar, leading to craving for it, and eventually it wrecks their dental health. The addiction could be similar to that of tobacco, and hence a matter of worry, Chief of Centre for Dental Education and Research (CDER) at the AIIMS, Dr O P Kharbanda, told PTI.Seeking to demystify the evidence on sugar consumption reaching levels of addiction akin to tobacco, the AIIMS is organising an international symposium here on  Is Sugar the New Tobacco  on November 11.Two international experts on dental health and nutrition from the UK would be attending the event, besides some experts from the AIIMS. The symposium would also deliberate on the global best practices on control of sugar intake and suitable guidelines needed in India context, he said.CDER also houses the WHO-Collaboration Centre on Oral Health Promotion, and Kharbanda, the head of the Division of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Deformities said, Infants as young as 1-2 years old are getting dental caries.Many mothers leave milk bottles in their babies mouths. And, this leads to deposition of sugar, mixed in the milk, in and around their teeth, leading to caries, said Kharbanda, who is also the chairman of the organising committee of the symposium.On teeth-related ailments, he added that about 25 per cent people suffer from malocclusion (imperfect positioning of the teeth when the jaws are closed), with the age group of 10-30 being the most susceptible.Oncologists in India have identified chewable tobacco as a major health scare leading to head-and-neck cancer, and suggested increasing taxation on such products to deter its consumption.Taxing sugary drinks can lower consumption and reduce obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay, according to a new WHO report released recently.National dietary surveys indicate that drinks and foods high in free sugars can be a major source of unnecessary calories in peoples diets, particularly in the case of children, adolescents and young adults, it says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: PTI Photo)Describing his visit to Nepal as a pilgrimage, President Pranab Mukherjee today highlighted the age-old cultural relations between India and Nepal underlining the importance of Pashupatinath temple, Varanasi and Rameshwaram for solace seekers of both the countries. Mukherjee, who was accorded a civic reception and handed over the key to the city of Kathmandu by Chief of its Municipal Corporation Rudrasingh Tamang, wrote in the visitors book that Kathmandu is not only the political capital of Nepal, but also a spiritual center for the people in the region.Watch What Else Is Making NewsI am particularly happy to visit this holy city once again. Needless to say, Kathmandu has expanded greatly since my last visit. I congratulate the Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office for their unfailing dedication in managing and maintaining this rapidly growing city  despite the inevitable challenges, he wrote.Addressing the gathering which included Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda, Mukherjee, the first Indian President to visit Nepal in 18 years, said: My visit to Nepal is also a kind of pilgrimage  it is a mission of friendship to foster ever greater understanding and cooperation between our two countries.Thousands of our citizens visit Nepal in search of solace at the holy temple of Pashupatinath and Muktinath. Similarly people from Nepal visit Varanasi in the North and Rameshwaram in the South in search of spiritual inspiration, he said.Earlier, Mukherjee, 80, who is on a three-day state visit to Nepal, started his day by offering prayers at the historical Pashupatinath Temple where he was welcomed by 108 Batuk (Hindu boys) chanting Swasti mantras amid musical resonance of panchai baja and thime baja (traditional musical instruments).He performed a special puja called Rudrabhisekh, which included bathing the Shiva Linga with panchamrit, consisting of milk, curd, honey, sugar and ghee, and lighting one lakh cotton lamps or lakh batti at the holy Hindu shrine.The temple, a UNESCO world heritage site, is visited by thousands of Hindus from across the world and considered one of the most sacred temples across the world.Later, the President was conferred an honorary D.Litt by Kathmandu University (KU) in recognition of his contribution to the international relations, public administration and leading a successful political career.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
592844487be9e0138af8aaeb,Another day in paradise: Life in Kashmir under curfew,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kashmir-unrest-burhan-wani-killing-aftermath-2932080/,2016-07-24,"Through the eyes of five men we tell the story of a day in besieged KashmirBy Bashaarat Masood, Sofi Ahsan and Mir EhsanIts 16 days now since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Muzaffar Wani set off massive street protests across Kashmir. More than 45 are dead, above 2,500 injured, large parts of the Valley remain under curfew, and supplies are running out. But if life must go on, so must these men, some of them thousands of miles from family, others just kilometres away, none able to visit home.He wont allow himself to be photographed, nor give his name. I dont want people to burn my home in Kupwara, he says. Call me by any name but not my original one. A constable in the J&K Police, he is currently posted as a personal security officer with a superintendent of police. But these days, no hand can be spared, and so he is out on the streets by 7 every morning, among those trying to keep the Valleys protesters in check.If the aim of protesters is to throw stones, ours is to save livesPersonal Security Officer, 28Constable, J&K PoliceThe 28-year-old, deployed as a personal security officer with an SP, says, Civilians hate us, there is no denying that (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi) The 28-year-old, deployed as a personal security officer with an SP, says, Civilians hate us, there is no denying that (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)Every day he ventures out, the constable says, he doesnt know by when in the night his duty will end.On most days, he fears what turn it will take. In this latest outburst of anger on the streets of Kashmir, police are at the receiving end. One policeman has been killed and at least 132 police and CRPF personnel have been injured since the protests began.As he gets ready to leave for work, the constable talks about how he hasnt been home since July 1. Kupwara, his home town, is just 90 km away, but he cant risk running into trouble on the way.The constable joined the force in 2011, and before the protests began, would usually visit home on weekends, after the Friday prayers. Since most Fridays are tense in the Valley, he looked forward to the peaceful ones.At the SP office where he reports for work, his boss, who doesnt want to be identified either, asks him whether he could visit home if he left late on Friday. It could be too dangerous, the constable replies. Youths stop you on the streets and ask for identity cards.The SPs office is at the Civil Secretariat, a relatively peaceful area. But the constable must go where the officer goes, and this means he often finds himself in front of stone-throwing protesters.At such times, the only thing to do is speed away, he says. Those of us who are part of escort teams have only one AK-47 rifle with us, he says. However, there have been several instances of protesters being killed in firing by such escort teams.When he was a civilian, the constable adds, he too thought police were responsible for excesses in the Valley. But when he joined the force, he understood what it meant to be a policeman here, he says. I saw what is right and wrong, and why a police officer does what he does. I dont worry about what people think about me as long as I am on the right side and have done no wrong.But as the day wears on and he stands alert amidst deserted streets and the curfew, the constable admits he has doubts. The year before he joined police was the year of widespread protests in the Valley, which saw 120 deaths. There was too much unemployment and yes, if I had an alternative job, perhaps I would have taken that, he says. Its not because of the situation, he clarifies, but this is a 24-hour job and it keeps me from home.His is traditionally a farmer family, and his brother is a teacher.When the SP is in his office, the constable eats at the pantry outside. But officially, there are no breaks during the day, he says.Finally, its evening, and another long day is nearing its end. The constable wont get into the failed politics that has brought Kashmir to an edge again, but sighs that the anger is only self-destructive. People damage government property and sometimes even hurt locals during protests. They dont understand that ultimately it is to their own harm. Police do right at their level and still public does not understand us and hates us. We (police) are trained to tolerate and have patience, come what may.He knows all the slurs hurled at them, he adds. How can people say police remain unaffected by the deaths of over 45 people and the damage caused to the eyes of over a hundred due to pellet firing, he asks. Civilians hate us, there is no denying that.But as he wraps up, only to come back the next morning, he still has faith, the constable adds. If it werent for people like us in uniform, there would have been problems. There would be many crimes, there would be no stopping them. If the aim of the protesters is to throw stones, ours is to save lives.These kids are so angry, they may take to streets, lose other eye tooDr Rashid Maqbool, 31Consultant Ophthalmologist, SMHS hospital, SrinagarDr Maqbool says he has not seen his newborn daughter for nearly a fortnight (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi) Dr Maqbool says he has not seen his newborn daughter for nearly a fortnight (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)OF THE 25 days since the birth of his daughter, Dr Rashid Maqbool has not seen her for 13. In truth, Maqbool says, with communication networks down, he is in the dark about both mother and daughter, who are away in Shopian. But, he adds, it cant compare with what some of his patients will have to endure  a lifetime in the dark.The controversial use of pellet guns by security forces has left at least 137 youths  including 15 children  with eye injuries, and the grim possibility that they could lose vision in one or both eyes. Doctors say that five of them have been blinded while more than 50 are unlikely to regain vision in one eye.Dr Maqbool is part of the team of doctors at the ophthalmology ward of SMHS Hospital in Srinagar which is treating most of the injured.There are 11 consultants and eight residents in the department  the only hospital in the Valley with an ophthalmology section.Over the last 10 days, Maqbool and his colleagues have operated on all the 137 injured patients.One Sunday, the 31-year-old surgeon says, he and his colleague, Dr Ishfaq Ahmad Sofi, were scheduled to operate on 25 patients in a day. When we started, we had 10 cases with eye injuries, but as we were operating on the third or fourth injured, we were informed that 20 more cases had arrived, he says.The number kept increasing, and when we finished at 11 in the night, we had spent 12 hours in the operation theatre without a break. We were still not done with the patients but we had to stop as the theatre required fumigation.On the second day of the protests itself, Dr Maqbool says, the team conducted 37 eye surgeries, most of them with pellet injuries and a few who had been hit by tear smoke cannisters. He adds that they would hear slogan-shouting every half an hour, signalling that another injured youth had been brought to the hospital.At one point, Dr Maqbool says, he had an emotional breakdown. I had stepped out of the theatre for a few minutes when I saw a 25-year-old injured youth. He was being resuscitated by a team of doctors but he succumbed, he says. For a few moments, I couldnt register anything. Should I continue with the surgeries?, I asked myself, he says. But I gathered myself and rushed back to the theatre.Dr Maqbool asserts that the current turmoil is different from the previous ones. I have been taken aback by the amount and intensity of the injuries. It is depressing to say the least, he says. Being doctors, we have to keep emotions aside, but there is only so much one can take. We feel disturbed by the pictures and the patients with such grievous injuries.And then he has another nagging worry for his patients. Young children losing an eye is never good, but some of these children are so angry. We fear that they will pick up stones again and lose the other eye too, he says.The current crisis has also temporarily split his family. At his home in Peer Bagh, on the outskirts of Srinagar city, his older daughter, who is three, keeps asking him to take her to her mother and newborn sister, who are at his wifes maternal home in Shopian, some 60 km from Srinagar. Dr Maqbools mother has been looking after her while he is in hospital.She keeps telling me to take her to Shopian, the doctor says. It is difficult these days, and even if I reach there, I may not be able to come back. What will happen to these patients here?Im amazed even elderly pelt stones at us. But verbal abuse is the worstParimal Mandal, 45Head Constable, CRPFIts not easy to stand at the same place for 10-12 hrs in the heat, says Mandal (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi) Its not easy to stand at the same place for 10-12 hrs in the heat, says Mandal (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)Home for Parimal Mandal is 2,200 kilometres away at Nadia in West Bengal, but for the past 11 years, the CRPF head constable has been stationed in Kashmir. With Srinagar under curfew, only men in uniform, like Mandal, roam the streets.For the last 12 days, I have been deployed at various locations in Old City. The intensity of the stone-pelting was severe for three days, between July 9 and 11, but it has since subsided, says Mandal, holding his Pump Action Gun that is used to fire tear gas shells.Every morning around 7 am, Mandal and his team of young jawans leave their camp in a bullet-proof bunker vehicle and head to Eidgah locality, to secure the main highway from the protesters. It pains me to see young boys, some as young as 7, pelt us with stones, says Mandal who joined the paramilitary force in 2005.Despite an extended stint in Kashmir, until now, Mandal has never had to deal with protesters. During the 2008 and 2010 crisis, he was tasked with guarding the Jawahar Tunnel, which links Kashmir to Jammu and is located about 90 km from Srinagar. My assignment then was to safeguard the tunnel from an attack and had nothing to do with crowd control, he says.Over the past few days, Mandal has got accustomed to the stone-pelters routines. The intensity of the stone-pelting is at its peak in the morning and in the late evening hours, he says. My men are most vulnerable in the morning and at the time of withdrawal, close to dusk. As the head of my section, I have to remain alert to guide them.He remains in touch with his superior officers over a wireless set. Once stone-pelting begins, he has to provide hourly updates to an officer, stationed 2 km away, at the camp. Most of the times, if the protesters are in a small group, we chase them with a mild lathicharge. But if there is a big crowd, even tear gas shells dont deter them, he says.Mandal insists that the pellet guns are used as a last option. We always carry pellet guns with us but use them only when we are unable to control the situation, he says, and believes that many of the youth who indulge in stone-pelting have become immune to tear gas and pepper spray.The CRPF men deployed in the city work in coordination with the local police, who are familiar with the topography. Local policeman always come to our rescue when we have to chase away the protesters in the congested lanes and by-lanes of Old City. It is surprising at times that elderly people throw stones at us and pass on information about our location to the stone-pelters.For Mandal, the most difficult part is when the protesters indulge in verbal abuse. As most of my men are young, it becomes difficult to control them when they are being abused. In fact, the protesters abuse only to provoke us.As the day wears on, Mandal and his men take turns to eat lunch and have their tea inside their bullet-proof vehicle. We can never take chances or lower our guard even when there is no stone-pelting. This is the time expert stone-pelters attack.Since the start of fresh protests in Kashmir, Mandal says, he has not been able to take rest or sleep properly. We leave our camp early in the morning and are back only at night. If there is some emergency, we must wear our uniform and riot gear and leave for the trouble spot, he says.The lack of communication channels affects the jawans too. My cellphone is not working and I dont have access to a landline number, so I have not been able to contact my wife and 16-year-old daughter. My family members must be worried, he says.Around 8 pm, the bullet-proof bunker arrives to pick Mandal and his men; he is the last to board. There has been no casualty or injury in my area today; I thank my stars, he says, as the vehicle fights its way through a barrage of stones from the lanes and by-lanes. By the time Mandal reaches his battalion headquarters, it is dark. When I reach the camp, all I want to do is rest, not even eat dinner though I am hungry. It is not easy to stand at one place for 10-12 hours in the sweltering heat. And two-three hours of rest is luxury.Afraid my son may get sucked inJaved Ahmad Dar, 40PhotojournalistPhotojournalists also face public wrath these days, and Dar blames TV channels (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi) Photojournalists also face public wrath these days, and Dar blames TV channels (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)Javed Ahmad Dar is sitting in his makeshift office at Srinagars press colony when his colleagues barge in. Lets rush to SMHS (Shri Maharaja Hari Singh) Hospital. They will bring the injured there, they tell him. Protesters have been fired upon at Behramshah (village) in Anantnag. A boy has been killed and several have been injured.Javed instinctively reaches for his camera before it dawns on him: the village is just a few hundred metres from his own house. Javed immediately drops his camera and instead reaches for his cellphone. He admits he is afraid for his 17-year-old son and his nephews.Javeds village, Muniward at Anantnag in south Kashmir, is the epicentre of the current protests and he fears that his son, Danish Javed, a Class XII student, could get sucked into the crisis. Whenever I hear about the injured, I think of him. He is of that age and could be in the protests at any time, he says.But with the Valley on the boil, communication, as always, is a casualty. Cellular services have been snapped and Javed cant get through. He is forced to rush to the hospital hoping none of his relatives is among the injured or dead. This restriction (on cellphones) makes it even more agonising, he says.Dar clicks his pictures at the spot and returns to office. The first thing he does is look for a way to contact those few in his village who have BSNL connections, the only line of communication in the Valley these days. After over an hour, he gets lucky. A relative tells him that everyone is fine at home.We have the most difficult job, says Javed, who works for an international wire agency. If there is an incident somewhere, everybody runs away from it, but we have to run towards it. The job becomes more difficult when you are in a conflict zone. It takes a toll on ones mental health, he adds.These days, with a strict curfew in places and no curfew passes, Javeds day starts earlier than usual. He says he leaves home at 5 am and reaches his office at around 6 am. I have to ensure that I reach the press colony before the security forces are deployed and before the protesters take to the roads, he says.At 7, he is out again to take pictures of the desolate streets under curfew. He returns to his office to file the pictures before taking his bike out again, through some of the most volatile neighbourhoods of Srinagar. In between, Javed says, if he gets a phone call about a protest, he rushes to the spot, or to a hospital if anybody is injured, passing through hostile security forces and the protesters.However, photojournalists increasingly have to not only defy curfew but also battle a hostile public, particularly family members of the injured at hospitals.The other day, I was at SMHS Hospital and couldnt take out my camera for several hours due to the crowd. There was a little window during which I took it out of my bag, clicked a few pictures and put it back in. I was lucky nobody found me with a camera. But they found a colleague taking pictures; he was beaten ruthlessly.Javed blames TV news channels for the sudden hostility towards those in his profession.People are very angry about the coverage by news channels. And then, they cant differentiate between media outlets, he says. Unfortunately, we are the first to reach at any spot and hence face the ire of the victims.There are many times, Javed says, he has ended up literally between a rock and a hard place  flanked by youths throwing stones on one side and the bullets of the police and paramilitary forces on the other.The most recent such incident was just 11 days ago, when he was returning from Tral after covering militant commander Burhan Wanis funeral.We were riding back when we suddenly found the road closed. A policeman pointed us to an alley, but a few metres in, we were blocked off by stone-throwing youths, while paramilitary forces moved in behind us. The CRPF men opened fire, he claims. We rushed through a narrow street only to find a dead end. We had to push our bikes over a hillock to reach a safer place. When we reached the highway again, we saw an ambulance, which, we were told, was carrying four youths hit by bullets at the place where we had been stuck. It could have been any one of us.By 7 in the evening, Javed is back at his office with hundreds of pictures. He sifts through them and zeroes in on a few. He then waits for almost an hour to upload them as the Internet is slow.By 9 pm, he is done but cant leave for home as this is the time the protesters control the streets. He finally heads home around 10 pm.No one has harmed us. But in an alien land, fear is naturalGurpesh Singh, 28Truck driver from PunjabHis truck was attacked the night Wani was killed. He is waiting to go home (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi) His truck was attacked the night Wani was killed. He is waiting to go home (Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)Gurpesh Singhs life is spent on the roads. A frequent traveller ferrying supplies to Kashmir, he has seen the worst of the Valley. But it is different this time, he says.He had left his home in Chohla Sahib, Punjab, on July 6 with a truckload of sugar to deliver to Kashmirs Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution (CAPD) Department and some private distributors in Srinagar. He had promised his sister, his only family, he would be back in a week.He was still on the road when Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani was killed on July 8. The same night, he found himself caught amidst a stone-throwing crowd at Sangam, a village in Anantnag, 45 km from Srinagar. As the flying stones shattered the windshield of his truck, Gurpesh says, he went numb for a few minutes.Later, he decided to abandon the plans to go to Srinagar, and to return to Lower Munda in Qazigund, the gateway to Kashmir.Gurpesh spent a week at Lower Munda waiting for the protests to end. When they didnt, he decided to take the risk and travel at night to Srinagar. Passing by burning tyres and roads blocked by tree trunks and stones, he arrived in Srinagar on the dawn of July 18.We are used to travelling at night, but this 90-km journey was scary, he says. When I reached Srinagar, it was a big, big relief.While he is used to running into protests in the Valley, night times would earlier be peaceful, Gurpesh recalls.After he arrived in Srinagar, he unloaded some of his cargo at Batamaloo in Srinagar, but it was not easy to find labourers for the job. He then moved to the CAPD yard to unload the remaining sugar bags.On an average more than 5,000 trucks enter the Valley, carrying rice, fuel, essential items and vegetables. Less than 25 per cent are making their way in now.Gurpesh has spent the last three days holed up inside the CAPD yard, along with some other truckers. They are from different parts of the country but three days of togetherness has brought them close to each other.Gurpesh has grown particularly fond of a trucker from Himachal Pradesh. Their days now revolve around their trucks parked at the yard  they cook, relax and sleep in them.He doesnt mind that part, Gurpesh says. We are used to it, but it is difficult to get groceries these days.Sitting inside his truck at 6 pm, he also worries about the night. As darkness descends and azaadi slogans reverberate from loudspeakers of mosques, Gurpesh says they start their long wait for dawn.The fact is that nobody has harmed us here. But then in an alien land, fear is natural, he says.Not able to return home due to curfew and protests, Gurpesh and other truckers also worry about having had no contact with families back home. The cellular services in the Valley are curbed, with only BSNL postpaid connections working.Talking about his elder sister, the only close relative he has now since their parents passed away several years ago, Gurpesh says, She must have gone mad waiting for news from me.He and the other truckers consider leaving every night, including just the previous evening with a group of protected Amarnath Yatra pilgrims. But they (the security forces) didnt allow us to go with them, Gurpesh says.Giving up the idea of leaving this night, Gurpesh prepares to go to sleep. I dont know why they throw stones at us, he sighs. We only bring food supplies for people even in the most difficult of times.Gurpesh generally earns around Rs 10,000 for a trip to Srinagar and an equal amount on return. Even if he has to make do with fare for just one way this time, he says he will be back.Darr kaisa (what fear)? he asserts. I will be here next week with another truck of food supply."

Parkash Singh Badal said the state government was examining the verdict and an appeal would be filed in the Apex Court against the decision.A day after Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed the appointment of 18 Chief Parliamentary Secretaries (CPS), Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Saturday said the state government will file an appeal against the decision in the Supreme Court.The state government will file an appeal in Supreme Court against the decision of Punjab and Haryana High Court on the appointment of Chief Parliamentary Secretaries (CPSs) in the state, Badal said here.He said the state government was examining the verdict and an appeal would be filed in the Apex Court against the decision.Badal said he had already asked the Advocate General of state to study the entire judgement and take appropriate action as per legal provisions within the ambit of law.Since the honourable High Court has given the decision yesterday so its too early to make any comment on it but we will definitely move to Apex court after studying the case with due deliberations, the Chief Minister said.In a setback to the SAD-BJP government in Punjab, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday quashed the appointment of 18 Chief Parliamentary Secretaries (CPS) by it in April 2012.To another query, the Chief Minister said Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Amarinder Singhs sudden love for farmers of state was momentary and confined up to next years Assembly elections.He said it was on record that Captain was having anti-farmer mindset, which has been reflected from his policies and attitude time and again.Badal reminded the people that on one hand SAD-BJP alliance had been providing free power to farmers but on the other during his regime Amarinder had discontinued this thereby putting enormous burden on farmers.Likewise, he said that the state Congress Chief was a part and parcel of the conspiracy to rob waters of state by constructing Satluj Yamuna Link canal hatched by his party.The Chief Minister said that Amarinder was issuing baseless statements on each and every issue.Badal cautioned the people that God forbid if Captain returns to power in the state then he would withdraw the facility of free power being given to people in the state.Captain and Congress are responsible for plight of farming community whereas we have always extended a helping hand to our food growers, he added.To another query, the Chief Minister solicited fulsome support and cooperation from the general public to wean away the menace of drugs from the state.He said the state government has already taken several path breaking initiatives to curb the menace.Replying to another query, the Chief Minister said that the modernisation of Bhogpur Cooperative Sugar Mill was on top priority of the state government.Badal said the state government was duty-bound for helping the cane growers of the region for which this mill could play an important role.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
59284ac77be9e0137c77c8ad,'Unholy' nexus rears its ugly head again,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/551815/unholy-nexus-rears-its-ugly.html,2016-06-12,"Manoj Dixit, June 12, 2016 0:19 ISTThere is a strong perception that the Uttar Pradesh government deliberately allowed self-styled godman Ram Briksh Yadav to stay on in Mathura, but things went out of its hands leading violence and loss of lives.When the Centrally-appointed N N Vohra committee submitted its report in 1993 on the purported nexus among politicians, bureaucrats and criminals in which he made several observations on the criminal network which was virtually running a parallel government, he had no idea that this report will never see the floor of Parliament. The report also discussed criminal gangs who enjoyed the patronage of politicians of all parties and the protection by government functionaries. It revealed that political leaders had become the leaders of gangs. Over the years, criminals had been elected to local bodies, Assemblies and Parliament.Vohra was actually referring to gangs of criminals which were becoming important to politicians of all shades and colourssome openly and others covertly. Over the last two decades, criminals have jumped into the fray and started getting into law-making bodies. They have started taking all routes to organise and create gangs and also senas in the name of protecting the gang leader.One of the latest routes, and the safest now, was to organise in the name of religion. The emergence of electronic media gave them even more strength than it would have been otherwise. Several gangsters own channels today to propagate their ideas and increase following and of course money. The emergence of Asaram Bapu is one such example. But the emergence of a boy from a Haryana village who played dholaks at weddings to being Baba Rampal was the turning point. Rampals rise was not because of his religious or spiritual greatness, but because of his ability to impress and affect local politics. All politicians were making a beeline before his ashram for support. This emboldened him to become a law unto himself.Ram Briksh Yadav joined Baba Jai Gurudev, the founder-leader of a cult, in 1972 and had even gone to jail with him during Emergency. Yadav was involved in an internecine conflict with two other groups of Babas followers over the control of the cults property valued more than Rs 10,000 crore. The Samajwadi Party (SP) saw an opportunity in him and started giving him socio-political support. Its startling that Ram Briksh was drawing Loktantra Senani Pension of Rs 15,000 from the state government. This is an SP government scheme for those who were jailed during the Emergency.Details regarding the strange beliefs and demands of the encroachers involved in the violent confrontation with the police in Mathura emerged even as the bodies were being counted. Their demands included the cancellation of elections of the President and prime minister. They also wanted the Indian currency to be replaced by the Azad Hind Fauj Currency, and that 60 litres of petrol and 40 litres of diesel be priced at Rs 1 each. One of their demands said that all documents related to law and order and the documents of citizenship must be made public as it would reveal who we really are.Powerful supportersAccording to reports, Ram Brikshs book Vidhik Satyagrah describes a financial freedom struggle and details the same strange demands such as banning the Indian currency. The township that emerged in Jawahar Bagh was shielded from action by local authorities by a powerful state minister, reports said. For over two years, Ram Brikshs followers camped at Jawahar Bagh and were provided three meals a day. This, along with subsidised sugar (Rs 25 per kg) and grapes (Rs 20 per kg as opposed to the market price of Rs 60 per kg), could not have been possible without a strong financier.It is obvious that like many other senas operating in India, there is a mixture of religion, politics and criminality. This ensures their weightage in the political system and opportunity to bargain, influence and blackmail. This dangerous cocktail is now becoming a phenomenon.The Akhilesh Yadav government is in a precarious situation. It is in full election mode and wishes to come back to power making history. The government has failed to control criminal elements, for this is their main constituency. This has led to their downfall every time they came to power. While the famed MY (Muslim-Yadav) combination is its main support base, the SP enjoys or seeks the support of even dreaded mafia gangs like those of D P Yadav, Atiq Ahmad and others.Akhileshs inability to take any action against them is a fact. They will not act, as the main cadre will be disappointed. They did the same in the Muzaffarnagar incident, blaming lower-level policemen and saving politicians. In the bargain, the top bureaucrats also saved themselves. The dye is being cast for elections 2017 and many such incidents are likely to recur.There are too many bosses in the state government and Akhilesh is probably the last. Akhileshs father Mulayam Singh Yadav, uncles Shivpal and Ramgopal, besides minister Azam Khan, all act independently. Mulayam has a difference of opinion with regard to winning the elections.

59284fa57be9e0137c77cc1c,The rise and fall of Ram Briksh Yadav,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/551813/rise-fall-ram-briksh-yadav.html,2016-06-12,"Sagar Kulkarni, June 12, 2016 0:17 ISTOn a cold winter morning in January 2014, a lanky, bearded man with a band of supporters knocked on the doors of a monastery set up by his late mentor Baba Jai Gurudev off NH-2 near Mathura.Ram Briksh Yadav, who ranked among Babas favourite disciples, was keen to have his fair share in the monasteryJai Gurudev Ashramthat had properties to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore spread across Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Ram Brikshs spiritual master passed away in May 2012 after handing over the keys of the empire to his driver Pankaj Yadav. Another claimant to the Babas legacy, Umakant Tiwari, too, had fallen out of favour and parted ways a couple of months before the Babas death. Tiwari set up his own Ashram in Madhya Pradesh.Left with nothing, Ram Briksh was trying his luck on the January morning to get a toe hold in the ashrams sprawling campus near Mathura. After a standoff with the inmates, the district administration directed them to Jawahar Bagh, which was then the designated spot for protests, given its proximity to the collectorate. Little did the administration know that Ram Briksh, who had around 30 supporters then, would gain thousands of followers and convert the 280-acre Jawahar Bagh as his fiefdom with blessings from the powers that be.The unsuspecting public, mostly from his native eastern Uttar Pradesh, were lured by the propaganda of establishing a Azad Hind Sarkar that would ensure a square meal for every citizen and make available essential commodities at very low rates. To entice the locals, Ram Briksh even sold sugar at a highly-subsidised rate of Rs 20 per kg and vegetables at Rs 5 per kg. The stunt worked as people from neighbouring coloniesmostly comprising government servantsthronged Jawahar Bagh.Invoking the legacy of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Ram Briksh gathered a sizable following over the next few months. He formed the Azad Bharat Vidhik Vaicharik Kranti Satyagrahi, an organisation whose followers called themselves the Swadhin Bharat Subhas Sena. Their major goals were establishing the Azad Hind Sarkar with Netaji as the first citizen and a Azad Hind currency, instead of the rupee. Initially, there were a few huts, but as the followers increased, Ram Briksh established his own parallel administration complete with arms training camps and a justice delivery system, said Vijay Singh, an engineering student in the Jail Colony next to Jawahar Bagh.Luring debt-riddenAccording to the police, most of the inmatesthere were nearly 3,000 of them at the time of eviction on June 2were from eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. Many of them were in deep debts due to a bad harvest and the assurance of food and other essentials lured them to Jawahar Bagh. But they soon realised the going was not easy. Once inside Jawahar Bagh, the inmates could go out depending on the wishes of Ram Briksh and only after leaving behind a family member as ransom.For the residents of the surrounding colonies, the daily sermons by Ram Briksh over the public address system became a headache. The allurement of cheap sugar and vegetables was soon replaced with regular argument with the inmates, their leader often charging at the locals menacingly surrounded by lathi-wielding followers. Soon, they had the sprawling 280-acre orchard under their control and the favourite morning walk destination of the locals saw children of inmates being trained in warfare and parades by arms-wielding men on roads leading to the settlement.Surprisingly, these poor people had very affluent friends. We saw people coming in fancy cars and SUVs to meet Ram Briksh, said Vijay Sharma, a government employee residing in one of the colonies surrounding Jawahar Bagh. But as friction with the locals increased, the former president of the Mathura Bar Association, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, got an eviction order from the Allahabad High Court.The local intelligence unit sent reports to Lucknow about arms training inside Jawahar Bagh and the possibility of links with the Maoists. But the administration was not particularly tough against the squatters, prompting accusations against the Samajwadi Party government of shielding them. The proverbial last straw was the attack on the Horticulture Department employees residing inside Jawahar Bagh in the middle of March. Their strong protests spurred the district administration into action. Already under pressure from the Allahabad High Court, the state government also fell in line.The end, however, was ugly. After adequate warnings to Ram Briksh, the district administration finalised June 3 for forcible eviction. A day earlier, SP (City) Mukul Dwivedi, along with Station Officer Santosh Yadav, visited the area to carry out a rehearsal of the action planned for the next day. As they approached Jawahar Bagh, Ram Brikshs followers showered bullets and stones at the police. Dwivedi, who was injured in the stone throwing, was lynched by Ram Brikshs followers, while Santosh Yadav suffered a fatal bullet injury. In the police firing that followed, 27 people were killed, including Ram Briksh."

Express Archive Succeessive drought years have left the state with a negative growth in agriculture for three years on the trot. Express ArchiveBY THE summer of 2015, when the new state government was about six months old, the refrain in rural Maharashtra was that voters might have miscalculated terribly in being swept up by the Modi wave. Led by the BJP, a mostly urban party, the government appeared to be at a loss on how to stem the rising rural discontent.Now, two years into its tenure, the government finds that succeessive drought years have left the state with a negative growth in agriculture for three years on the trot. But with the rain gods having finally offered respite this year, September-end sowing data showed that a recovery could well be under way in the fields  the state government has recorded a 11 per cent increase in area under cultivation, storage levels in the big reservoirs augurs a likely good Rabi season too.The biggest challenge for this government in this sector was handling drought, and hardly any relief or compensation was paid to farmers and agricultural labourers, said Dr Ashok Dhawale, national joint secretary of the left-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha. In fact, as the rural economy worsened owing to drought, the state persisted with time-worn relief strategies, spending more and more on fodder camps and water tankers. In 2014-15, the state sought a Central assistance of Rs 6,013.28 crore  it received Rs 1,962.99 crore. It then sought Rs 4,002.82 crore in 2015-16 and received Rs 3,049.36 crore.In worst-hit Marathwada, from subsidised foodgrain to free fodder camps for animals, state relief measures were central to farmers lives during the summer months, but the impact of the distress on various aspects of rural life continued to deepen.Additionally, the bankruptcy of the governments policies is seen in its inability to offer a right price for farm produce. This year, to give you one example, soyabean and moong prices are half of last years prices  the peasantry has more crop this year but still, less money, said Dr Dhawale, adding that issues such as the connection between rising malnutrition-related infant deaths to agrarian distress had not even been touched upon.In fact, farm prices have been a recurring ground for criticism of the states agriculture policies, across commodities.Due to the low price of sugar, mills ran into trouble last year with many failing to clear payments to growers  a first for the sector. Together, the state and the Central governments had cleared Rs 1,200 crore as excise and soft loans for the sector to help them pay the growers. Millers on their part had wanted the above amount as a grant, which the government refused. They have to start repayment of the loans from this season. Non- payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to growers also led to action against 34 mills in the last two years  the highest ever recorded in the state. While millers accelerated the payments, the crushing season of 2016-17 kicks off alongside unpaid dues of Rs 123 crore. This, despite the presence of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana  representative of thousands of cane growers  in the state government.Millers concede that this has sent out a strong message to the powerful sugar barons  no more largesse and bailouts to the sector, something it had been accustomed to. One of the promises on which this government was elected was a fair price for farm produce, and the government has committed a breach of faith of farmers, said Raghunathdada Patil, senior farmer leader who contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on an AAP ticket. Worse, multiple laws this government passed have been anti-farmer. The beef ban law, for example, has led to interference of the state even on a farmers pashudhan (livestock). And then, whether its a bullet train or smart cities or other land acquisition, its the farmers who are at a loss.The state has also not been able to reverse the low coverage of agriculture insurance in Maharashtra. In 2014-15, Maharashtra had 22 per cent of gross cropped area insured, not even half the percentage scored by Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. On the positive side, there is now an agriculture policy of the state government, with the mission-mode objectives clearly stated  to achieve 4 per cent growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors, to promote entrepreneurship in agriculture and allied sectors, to increase net farm returns, crop diversification, etc.Also on the positive side, during 2014-15, Maharashtra stood first in terms of fruit production with a 12.22 per cent share in total national production, despite low productivity.In a huge reform, the state has also launched farmer-to-consumer markets alongside taking forward the APMC reforms for more barrier-free markets.Some of these moves are seen as political. The market committees, for instance, have been strongholds of the NCP and the Congress. The government has now taken to appointing expert directors on these bodies. Former NCP MLA and president of the federation of APMCs Dilip Mohite Patil called this an attempt by the Sena-BJP to gain a backdoor entry to these bodies.Another innovative reform is a pilot project of 10,000 solar pumps for agriculture, offering round-the-year power, a reduced demand-supply gap and a lower subsidy burden to the state electricity board. The policy also makes mention of infusing public investment in agriculture, to boost growth and build capacity, about furthering agricultural research and, critically, the revival of district cooperative banks. Much of this, however, will only begin once the government is well into its third year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

However, the end of the season has not seen mills clearing their dues with many mills running into unpaid cane dues.Prior to Mondays action, sugar commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma had cancelled the licence of 11 mills and suspended the licence of at least 39 mills during the present crushing season. Also, auction of sugar stock of more than 12 mills was ordered by the commissioner.Mondays action was against mills which have paid below 90 per cent of the FRP. A majority of the mills which faced action were in Marathwada with few others in Pune, Solapur and Ahmednagar, among other districts. The two mills which had their licences cancelled were also fined with the total quantum of fine being at least Rs 40 crore.Cancellation of licence results in levying of fine of Rs 500 per quintal of cane crushed which the mill has to pay in order to get a crushing licence for the next crushing season.As of May 31, the state had to clear unpaid FRP worth Rs 16,489 crore of which Rs 15,586 crore has been paid.

Harishchandra Sapkal (60), a farmer from Chincholi village in Latur district, breaks down while narrating his woes. Even our cows and goats do not have fodder and government officials are refusing them shelter I had to feed them four-year-old fodder lying with me, he said.In Marathwada, 370 farmers committed suicide in the last four months with crop failure and mounting debts being cited as principal reasons, taking farmer suicides in the drought-hit region to 1,450 in 16 months. Farmers in Latur district have also been found to be cursing their fate for picking the wrong crop pattern, which has yielded them nothing but misery.The hard-hit seem to be sugarcane farmers, who find themselves in the midst of acres of wrecked cane crop, an unnerving sight.Marathwada has seen 20-25 farmer suicides every week. In Latur district, 51 farmers have committed suicide in the past four months.When an Indian Express team visited Chincholi village, around 20 km from Latur city, 60-year-old Harishchandra Sapkal was all alone in his nearly one-and-half acre farm. Donning the traditional Maharashtrian dhoter and pheta, Sapkal was trying to feed fodder to his handful of cows and buffaloes under the shade of a couple of trees. Even as the Indian Express lensman zoomed in his camera on the sugarcane crop, which had turned pale yellow and had slumped partially, Sapkal trudged his way to the farm in the blazing sun and quickly pointed to what he said was the biggest mistake of his life. I thought sugarcane crop will yield me better returns than what I was sowing all these yearsbut it was my biggest mistake. I shouldnt have taken to sugarcane crop at all.I have lost all my investment, said Sapkal as he broke down, wiping tears with his pheta.At times, I feel like committing suicideBut the thought of how my family will cope after me has made me change my mind, he said.Sapkal said he invested nearly Rs 4 lakh in the last three years in sugarcane crop, but did not get a single paisa as profit. Thankfully, I did not take loan from banks, but used my savings besides borrowing only from close relatives.Sugarcane crop, said Sapkal, needs a lot of water but in the last two-three years, Latur has hardly had any rain. Before sugarcane, I was sowing crops like soyabean and tur which did not require much water. For years, I was getting handsome return on my investment but I was struck by some madness, which made me turn to sugarcane crop, he said.Sapkal said he doesnt have fodder for his cattle. Two of my cows have died, several goats too have died. When I went to the cattle camp, I was turned awayI had no option but to feed fodder which I had stored for two years, he said in a choked voice.But what made him take up sugarcane crop? Every other farmers in the area, said Sapkal, were convinced by some people to go for sugarcane crop as the nearby sugar mill was paying better.Sapkal is not alone to be caught in the wrong lane. According to the agriculture department, nearly 5,000 cane farmers have been affected in the last two years due to less than 50 per cent average annual rainfall in the district. Of the 5.56 lakh hectare land for kharif crop in Latur, sugarcane is sowed on 45,000 hectare land. The yield has been less than 50 per cent this year In 2013-14, it was little better, but in past two years, it has been worse, said Gurunath Thonte, agriculture office (technical dept).Officials said it was wrong to blame sugarcane for the plight of farmers in Latur district. Sugar factories have been in existence in Latur for more than 20 years. All these years, farmers turned to the crop as it gave good returns. Also, the main reason is, it requires less labour as sugar factories themselves harvest the crop, officials said. Latur has 12 sugar factories, at least four belonging to the late Vilasrao Deshmukh family.Irrigation experts too dont agree with the view expressed by even likes of water man Rajendra Singh  that sugarcane has been responsible for plight of farmers not only Latur, but all over Marathwada. It is wrong to say sugarcane crop has led to downfall of farmers In fact, cane has over the years sustained farmers who got good returns on investment. It is only in the last two-three years due to failure of monsoon that farmers have been hit badly, said P N Todkar, a retired irrigation official. Todkar said every year, Latur receives 800 mm rainfall, but in past three years, it has been an average of 400 mm hitting farms adversely.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

However, there are financial implications in the way as sugar mills have urged the government to stand guarantor for loans it seeks from banks for investment in drip infrastructure.Notwithstanding the financial hurdles, the Centre and the state are all set to make drip irrigation a compulsion, as part of the long-term drought mitigation policy.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said, There is no alternative to drip irrigation for all high water-intensive crops. To begin with, we will have to make drip irrigation mandatory for sugarcane crops.All studies by government on water management recommended that all water-intensive crops/horticulture, including sugarcane, bananas, grapes should be brought under drip irrigation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after a drought meeting with the chief minister, had observed, I have stressed on vitality of increasing water use efficiently through sprinkler and drip irrigation, including in sugarcane cultivation.A senior cabinet minister said, Despite the necessity, we have to adopt flexibility. We will extend subsidies upto 50 to 75 per cent to small and marginal farmers from backward category who switch over to drip irrigation to enable them to sustain the additional expenditure. Sugar mills are not seeking direct subsidies. But they have urged the state government to stand guarantor for bank loans they would seek for investments in drip infrastructure.However, the ministry of finance is not very keen on making immediate commitments. As sources said, Rs 4,000 crore support to farmers for drip irrigation is not viable in the long run.At present, less than 20 per cent of sugarcane growers have adopted drip irrigation. The chief minister indicated that various research institutes and collaborations with Israel can pave the way for adapting a more economical model for drip irrigation in rural Maharashtra. Former minister for cooperation, Harshvarshan Patil, said, I fully support the state governments initiative for making drip irrigation compulsory for sugarcane crops. We have to go for better water management.The results from drip irrigation, compiled by the state government across districts reeling under drought, show that drip irrigation, along with protected farming yielded higher and better crop. The higher expense in drip infrastructure is easily recovered through dividends from higher production.The agriculture department is playing a crucial role to provide logistical and technological support to farmers groups ready to experiment in drought prone districts in Vidarbha and Marathwada.More Related News Tikka crowned Kinnow King for transforming barren landFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The department has zeroed in on 15 mills, raising tax demands of more than Rs 25 crore and cumulative tax demands of more than Rs 1,100 crore.Along with unpaid cane growers, now Income-Tax officers have come knocking at the doors of cooperative sugar mills in the state. The I-T department says 22 cooperative mills owe it more than Rs 1,200 crore in unpaid taxes.Sources said for the last 20 years, I-T officers have been raising the issue of unpaid taxes by mills who have paid over and above the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) to growers. The Income-Tax department feels payments over and above the FRP constitute profit on income and is distributed among the members. Tax demands are raised on such payments, said an industry insider.The department has zeroed in on 15 mills, raising tax demands of more than Rs 25 crore and cumulative tax demands of more than Rs 1,100 crore. Of the 15 mills, three mills have tax demands of more than Rs 100 crore while two have tax demands of over Rs 90 crore.Three mills have unpaid tax demands of more than Rs 70 crore and rest of the mills have unpaid tax demands in the range of Rs 50-20 crore. There are seven mills whose tax demands are between Rs 3 crore and Rs 25 crore.Interestingly, almost 90 per cent of the mills are from the sugar-belt of Western Maharashtra. Most mills are from the districts of Satara, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Pune.Jayprakash Dandegaonkar, vice-president of the Maharashtra Sugar Cooperative Factories Federation, questioned the I-T departments tax demands. Cooperative mills are examples of successful partnerships among farmers. Payment over FRP can hardly be constructed as profit from income, he said.In 2007-08, the cooperative mills had filed a case against the I-T department over the issue. Dandegaonkar said the millers had engaged eminent lawyer Harish Salve to argue their case. However, Salve had to leave for London so through the intervention of former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, we have asked former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram to argue our case. The case will come up before a three-judge bench hopefully soon, he said.Dandegaonkar said the millers led by Pawar had met both the prime minister and the Union finance minister to discuss the issue. If the Supreme Court upholds the decision of the I-T department, then the cooperative mills would be in deep financial distress, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Fadnavis said, We have worked out an integrated model of textile and agro industries to open up new market opportunities with higher remuneration for cotton farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada.The state governments policy to promote the textile sector has started yielding results, with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday performing the bhoomipujan for the units of J K Investors Ltd and Raymond Group of Companies at Nandgaon Peth in Amravati.The state government, which has tapped Rs 4,000 crore investments with employment generation of 12,500 in the cotton distressed districts of Vidarbha, carried out major amendments in the textile policy for increasing ease of doing business.Fadnavis said, We have worked out an integrated model of textile and agro industries to open up new market opportunities with higher remuneration for cotton farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada.The textile sector is the second largest when it comes to employment. Cotton cultivation stretches to 42 percent of the agro-land. Tax concession on yarns, cotton processing units, interest subsidy upto ten percent are part of the national Farm to Fashion policy to promote the textile sector.Major policy decisions to promote the sector includes 30 per cent subsidy for self financing. The government has stressed single-window clearance to provide land along with basic infrastructure. Concessions in power tariff is an added attraction for investors. The state government had signed an MoU with Raymond Group of Companies for a textile park and manufacturing hub worth Rs 1,400 crore, during the Make In India Week in February in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In less than two months, all formalities have been completed paving the way for the mega-textile hub to start work, the CM said, adding, Amravati as the leading textile destination of the country will become a reality in the next four years.We have overwhelming response from investors seeking land for setting up textile units in Vidarbha. Now, this is a major change from the past when our developed land along with infrastructure at MIDC had no takers. Today, we have no space at MIDC in this region. The 14 textile parks, complete with manufacturing and apparel units in Vidarbha and Marathwada, have been taken up to provide a robust market for cotton cultivators. The chief minister recalled, The white gold tag associated with cotton cash crop has lost its shine because of the agro-distress in the last two decades. Our textile policies linked to agro-industries will help us take cotton crop to its old glory.Cotton cultivators, often with small land holdings can thrive only if they have an assured market. The government wants to adopt the western Maharashtra model where sugar mills and sugar cane cultivators are inter-linked and inter-dependent.The state government has also decided to promote textile technology in the sector to ensure better production of cotton to help farmers and efficient operations for the manufacturing sector. While inaugurating the Siyaram Silk Mills Golden Fibres Plant, marking commencement of operational activities, the chief minister hoped it would work to the advantage of youths. The new textile hubs sanctioned in MIDC includes Nandgaon (Amravati), Yavatmal, Chikali (Buldhana), Jamner (Jalgaon), Kannad (Aurangabad), Selu (Parbhani), Bhaler (Nandurbar), Malegaon (Nashik), Kunnor (Nanded), Mazalgaon (Beed), Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation new textile park.The government has allocated 102 hectares to Messrs Shyam Indofab Ltd, MVHM Industries, Suryalaxmi Mills, Siyaram Silk for textile and processing units at Nandgaon.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

I will first talk to Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and then elaborate on my plan.Of the total 42 ministerial berths, currently there are only 30 ministers in the cabinet. Of the 30, BJP has 20 ministers and the Sena, 10 ministers.There is a scope to fill up 12 berths, of which two will be given to the Shiv Sena and 10 will remain with the BJP. The BJP may include smaller alliance partners supporting the government  such as the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, the Rashtriya Samaj Party, the RPI and the Shiv Sangram  as part of the 10 and keep the remaining six berths for its own party candidates. Two seats, however, might be kept vacant for future.An overall ministerial performance audit will be undertaken in March 2017 which will weed out non-performers and award those who have done well.Responding to claims by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray that Union ministers from the BJP are paying no heed to the drought situation, Fadnavis said Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Power Minister Piyush Goyal have regularly been in touch with him. The railway minister provided us with the trains for supplying water to drought-hit Latur in record time. The Centre is providing all necessary help.Elaborating on the measures the state government is taking to bring relief in the drought-hit region, the chief minister said that the government is firm on not allowing new sugar mills in Marathwada.

In the past, the focus was on untreated industrial effluents alone.The government is also considering public-private partnerships to raise funds for river cleaning along with mega infra or industrial projects.Overseas companies are ready to give soft loans at lower interest to be repaid over 30-40 years.The draft proposal for new environmental pollution points to an urgency to address the problems of untreated sewage and solid waste, which is playing havoc along the states 720-km coastal stretch.There are 49 polluted river stretches out of a total 302, which are worst polluted.They include Godavari, Tapi, Wardha-Wainganga, Krishna, Panchganga, Koyana, Mula, Mutha and Pravara basins, among others.The study commissioned by the state government shows 45 to 48 per cent rapid urbanisation is integral to the pollution of major river basins, including Godavari and Krishna. The untreated sewage from the cities/towns are routed to the water sources, including rivers.The National River Conservative Plan of the Centre is working on river-cleaning projects across 150 stretches in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Assam and other states.Adopting a two-pronged strategy to tackle the pollution menace, the Ministry of Urban Development, along with local municipal corporations, are working on projects with a 2017 deadline to make the state free of open defecation.The Centre and the states ambitious Smart Cities project too has given impetus on sewage and solid waste management.The state has initiated a step by taking up river cleaning in Chandrabhaga in the pilgrimage town Pandharpur by 2022. However, there is greater pressure to take up Godavari river cleaning from Nashik. Until 2000, we believed the Krishna basin encompassing stretches along Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Solpaur were instrumental in causing pollution because of discharge of untreated water from sugar mills operating in this western Maharashtra belt. Toxic fertilisers would drain into the rivers However, new factors indicate that industrial effluents are just one aspect. There is greater problem in absence of solid waste management, said a source.Acknowledging that there cannot be any compromise on stringent rules for industrial effluents, upgrade of plants has become mandatory.According to an MIDC official, The new units cannot be sanctioned unless they conform to the environment parameters. To curb violations, we have to put in place a more effective monitoring mechanism.Draft Development Control regulations (2014-2034) are expected to be unveiled later this week.

A couple of days ago, Munde justified water supply to breweries in Aurangabad, shortly after Uddhav Thackeray demanded suspension of water supply to breweries because of the drought.Taking a drought selfie is not the first instance when Rural Development Minister Pankaja Munde has left the BJP-led government in Maharashtra red faced. In the recent past, the ministers stand on several issues were not in accordance with government policies and it included her flip flop on allowing women into the Shani Shinganpur temple in Ahmednagar, her justification of supply of water for breweries and support for sugar mills on the matter of fair price remuneration.Her selfie in drought-hit Latur has invited flak from across the political spectrum including the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena. Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said it showed a Selfie Sarkar. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray defined it as highly insensitive and shameful, during a severe drought.A couple of days ago, Munde justified water supply to breweries in Aurangabad, shortly after Uddhav Thackeray demanded suspension of water supply to breweries because of the drought. Thackeray said priority should be to provide water to people, and not breweries.Munde argued, There is a stipulated quota of water supply for drinking purpose, industries and agriculture. And if water allocated for industries is being utilised, there is nothing wrong.Mundes logic invited flak from Congress, NCP, Sena and BJP. Many wondered if she were aware of ground realities.A Sena cabinet minister said, On one hand the government is getting railways to supply water to Latur. There are 25,000 villages facing drought. And we have Munde talking of water quota. When there is no water, which quota is she referring to?Fadnavis had to clarify, The government will not compromise on drinking water supply. Breweries are not our priority.At the peak of the agitation when women activists were demanding entry into Shanishingnapur temple, Munde had said, Traditional rituals cannot be linked with insult of the female fraternity. Mundes justification was contradictory to sentiments of cabinet colleagues and top leaders across party lines.Fadnavis clarified, Places of worship cannot have gender discrimination. Hindu religion or teachings do not approve discrimination against women. They have equal rights to worship. NCP president Sharad Pawar also vehemently opposed gender discrimination.In the first winter session of the government, when senior minister for Cooperation and Markets Chandrakant Patil threatened to crack the whip on sugar mills for violating norms of fair price remuneration, Munde came out in the state assembly in defense of sugar mills citing multiple problems. The NCP used it to expose the divide within the BJP government.In the recently concluded budget session, Mundes odd remarks questioning the opposition created an uproar. The Congress, NCP had raised a question on controversial chikki scam in which she had been named. Munde, in passing, said, I pity your grasping power. Vikhe-Patil and Jayant Patil were among leaders who termed it inappropriate and highhanded.Earlier, during her visit to water conservation projects, images of personnel holding her footwear as she walked ahead was widely discussed. Later, Munde justified the act.Another issue that often becomes a talking point relates to her name in the chief ministers race. While she has never directly claimed the post, she, in a veiled manner makes it a point that her followers would like to see her as chief minister. Or if the party decides, she would accept the post.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

By 2016 end, we will ensure replication of Israels per-drop-more-crop water management model to treat water as essential and economic commodity. Drip irrigation in high water-intensive crops will have to be enforced by one and all, including sugar cane cultivators, he said.Stating that drought could not be dismissed as a rural phenomena, Fadnavis said the state would integrate policies to co-relate water management through linking of rivers, adopting crop patterns adaptable to climate changes and creating urban-rural markets through agro-industries.The government has been facing criticism from various quarters, such as political opponents, courts and water experts, with regard to management of drought in Maharashtra.On the controversy related to holding IPL matches in Maharashtra when the state is reeling under severe water shortage, Fadnavis said, There is no question of providing drinking water to nurture the pitch. If they shift the game outside Maharashtra, I have no problems.The CM said the state was fighting hydrological drought in some parts and agricultural drought in other. If 15,600 villages are reeling under severe water scarcity in Marashtwada , there are 12,000 villages in Vidarbha that are reeling under crop loss despite moderate rains. Almost 25,000 to 27,000 villages, out of the 40,000, are reeling under farm crisis, he said.Reckoning that April and May would be critical as water levels in dams, wells and ponds would go down further, he said, We have made adequate provisions to ensure no body goes hungry or thirsty. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has approved my proposal to deploy regular trains to supply water to drought-hit districts. Moreover, we have adequate food stocks in every drought-hit district. The 14 districts worst hit are being provided with free food grains and 68 lakh people are availing the scheme.Fadnavis said the government had been working on major policy reforms to plug the financially bleeding district cooperative banks on one hand and enhance the irrigation potential, which has remained stagnant at 18 per cent for 15 years, on the other.On the steps undertaken to help the drought-hit, the CM said the government had made Rs 18,000-crore investments the last 15 months, spending on relief and crop loss compensation, crop insurance, ensuring free education to children in schools and professional colleges, and arranging health care.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Pramod Karnad, managing director of MSC Bank, said this was the eighth time the bank had raised valuation of sugar since October.Increased valuation and increase in margin allow mills to have more money to pay cane growers.Sugar prices on NCDEx platform has been bullish with prices hovering above the Rs 3,500 mark. The future prices of July, October shows that the price of the commodity can cross the Rs 3,700 mark easily. Also in the international market the price has been on the rise.The increase in price of sugar failed to help millers clear dues to growers. As of March-end, cane worth Rs 15,000 crore has been crushed in the state with millers paying Rs 12,000 crore towards payment of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP).Although the state stares at a backlog of Rs 3,000 crore, officers of the sugar commissioner say last month was better in payment as most mills have adhered to the 80-20 formula for payment of FRP. Officers say that around 12 mills have unpaid dues worth Rs 200 crore carried forward from the crushing season of 2014-15.As of Tuesday, 144 of the 177 mills that had gone for crushing have closed down for the season leaving only 33 operational.The state has seen 727.24 lakh metric tonnes of cane being crushed and 819.54 lakh quintals of sugar being produced.Increase in sugar prices has also seen Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghathana upping the ante for more payment for growers.MP Raju Shetti of the Sanghathana on Sunday held a rally in Kolhapur and asked for higher payment to cane growers. Also there are talks of implementation of the Rangarajan Committees profit sharing formula along with quick payment of balance money to growers.However, mills appear to be pessimistic towards any such move with Shivajirao Nagavade Patil, chairman of the Maharashtra State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories, talking about serious financial crisis being faced by millers. From April onwards, mills will have to pay installments towards excise subvention and soft loan of the Central government. While cumulatively both loans would translate into a financial burden of Rs 2-3 crores, the volatility in sugar prices has made business unstable,he said.Patil said over the last few days sugar prices have again dipped both in national and international markets.Only if sugar prices remain stable at Rs 3,600 per tonne would sugar mills be financially viable, he said.According to him, the problems of millers would be more acute given the bleak outlook of the crushing season 2016-17.Solapur, Ahmednagar and major portions of Pune and Marathwada will face a huge dearth of cane. Mills will find it difficult to go for crushing, he said. In view of the present situation the Federation has asked the central government to reschedule the payment of loans.We have asked for time from the chief minister to discuss the matter and we would be meeting him again, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Sugar prices had crashed last year, resulting in millers defaulting in their payment of fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the sugarcane growers. The season had started with payment arrears of over Rs 1,000 crore. The sugar commissioner had ordered auction for the sugar stock of 11 mills over their failure to pay the sugarcane growers for the season 2014-15 . For the current season, 12 such orders were issued, of which stock of only two mills were auctioned as the rest had either obtained stay from the minister of cooperation or from the courts. The current season had also seen suspension of crushing licence of 14 mills for non clearance of their dues  a first of its kind in the state.Mills till date have crushed sugarcane worth of Rs 16,012 crore, of which payment to the tune of Rs 12,856 crore was made. The payment made adheres to the 80:20 payment schedule fixed at the start of the crushing season with the payment of Rs 3,156 crore yet to be made.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghathana has demanded payment by May 1, which the millers say is not possible. The season has seen 43 lakh tonnes of sugar being sold, a bit lesser than the previous years figures.Just seven mills in the state have paid 100 per cent FRP this season. The next crushing season, the millers have said, would see far lesser cane area and lesser mills going for crushing. BB Thombare , the chairman of Western Indian Sugar Mills Association (WISMA) has said that most of the mills in Marathwada would not be going for crushing.

At a special meeting of the chairmen and managing directors of sugar mills held in Pune on Thursday, Pawar said Marathwada had been cultivating cane for the last 20 years.NCP supremo and former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar refused to link the increase in area under cane cultivation in Marathwada to the ongoing water crisis in the region. Pawar said the severe water crisis was a result of continuous failure of monsoon for the last two-three years.At a special meeting of the chairmen and managing directors of sugar mills held in Pune on Thursday, Pawar said Marathwada had been cultivating cane for the last 20 years.We never had any complaints of drought. This years drought is due to the failure of rains, and not due to cane, he said.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar.His comments come at a time when the increase in area under water-guzzling sugarcane in parched Marathwada is being singled out by environmentalists and water experts for the crisis in the region. A few days ago, Revenue and Agriculture Minister Eknath Khadse had come down heavily on the sugar mills in Marathwada and said the government would not allow any new mill to come up in the region in the next five years.Last year, Khadse had opined that mills in Marathwada should not be allowed to go for crushing as it could lead to water crisis.Watch Video | Video Of Water Train Arriving In LaturPawar said a scientific study was being conducted by the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI), which would address all concerns regarding cane cultivation in water-stressed region. It will be wrong to blame cane for the water crisis. But yes, mills need to ensure more and more area comes under drip irrigation, which will save water, he said.Asked about Khadses statement of not allowing any new mill in Marathwada, Pawar said he agreed to it. He said the condition of the sugar industry was not conducive to new mills. The NCP chief said the mills not going for drip irrigation en masse was due to budgetaryconstraints from the Central government. As the crushing season for the year 2015-16 comes to an end, prices of retail sugar has seen a rise. Pawar said this had concerned the Central government.Millers are complaining of non-lifting of their stock by traders. I will meet the Central government and ask it to buy sugar from the millers at the price offered by the traders, he said. The Centre, Pawar said, was thinking of either imposing a stock limit for millers or going for import duty to compel the sugar millers to sell their stock. A special meeting in this regard would be held in Delhi next week, he said.Minister for Cooperation Chandrakant Patil, who was also present during the meeting, urged millers to clear the unpaid dues to cane growers, which as of April 15 stands at around Rs 3,000 crore. The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana has warned of stir in case the dues are not paid by May 1.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Across the country, the total sugar for export too is low, not exceeding 5.6 lakh metric tonnes.The state government on Monday directed sugar mills to release their export quota as per guidelines or forego special incentives awarded by the Centre and the state, including waiver on purchase tax on sugarcane. The incentives include soft loans with low interest rate for co-generation and tax exemption on purchase of sugarcane by mills.The emphasis on export of sugar is to ensure the domestic market doesnt crash. At the same time, the remuneration from export of sugar would help the sugar mills to sustain and also extend better Fair Price Remuneration to the cane-growing farmers, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said.Of the total sugar export of 40 lakh metric tonnes, Maharashtra has to provide 14 lakh metric tonnes. So far, state sugar mills have released only 3.80 lakh metric tonnes for export. Across the country, the total sugar for export too is low, not exceeding 5.6 lakh metric tonnes.Every sugar mill is expected to release 12 per cent of its average three years production for export. The export is linked with the concessions given by the Centre and the state to the sugar sector to make it more robust due to uncertainty in the global and domestic markets.NCP president Sharad Pawar, who attended the meeting, said, The 12 per cent of the current production of sugar should be considered instead of taking an average of the last three years.Former energy and finance minister Dilip Walse-Patil recommended restructuring of loans to help the sugar mills and also farmers. However, considering the crisis in Maharashtra due to acute water scarcity for the fourth consecutive year, the state government is considering not to enforce the decision on incentive waiver on sugar mills operating in these regions.The chief ministers primary concern is to ensure farmers get better remunaration. Sugar mills too stand to gain.The sugar production for 2015-16 is estimated to drop by 25 per cent. It was 89 lakh metric tonnes the previous year.The production drop is essentially due to drought, which has led to huge crop damages and also discouraged farmers from taking up cane cultivation in a big way.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Senior officials in commissionerate said the government may seize and auction the sugar stock of such mills.The start of the present sugarcane crushing season saw Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis chair a meeting of mill owners and growers about payment of the FRP. While the cane-growers, led by Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathana, had demanded the FRP in one installment, mill owners wanted to pay in three installments. After the meeting, it was decided that for the current season, FRP would be paid in two installment in the 80:20 formula.Payment trends so far show that most of the mills have adhered to the formula, but have deferred the payment. As of January 31, the total payment due to cane growers was around Rs 9,060 crore. As per the 80:20 formula, the payment due calculates to Rs 7,248 crore.

Express files .Water availability in dams/rivers and crop pattern in drought-prone districts across Maharashtra will be mapped to make course corrections in water supply. Express filesThe state government will conduct a water audit to formulate a comprehensive policy to plug misuse of water by the private sector in districts reeling under a drinking water crisis. Water availability in dams/rivers and crop pattern in drought-prone districts across Maharashtra will be mapped to make course corrections in water supply. Strict water audit in 14 drought-hit districts is on the cards.The government will bring in stringent rules to make drip irrigation mandatory for all water intensive crops, including sugarcane. Acknowledging that drinking water has to be given highest priority, a restructuring of lifting of water from dams by the sugar mills using barrages specially in critical districts like Latur, Osmanabad, Beed, Solapur is being done. At present, there are 202 cooperative sugar mills apart from 64 private mills. Drip irrigation is expected to increase yield and prevent wastage of water from dams and rivers availed by sugar mills.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis asserted, Apart from jalyukta shivar project to generate higher water storing capacity, effective management of water is more significant. At the drought review meeting, he said, Whether it is through wider use of drip irrigation for all water intensive crops or plugging misuse of water which is drawn for cane but leaves the villagers thirsty, the government will come out with a comprehensive plan.While the government acknowledges that they will not enforce any ban on any crop, it cannot allow exploitation of water for cultivation of sugarcane without water budget.Statistics revealed by the department of water resources and agriculture indicate 70 percent sugar mills violate rules and lift huge quantity of water from dams and rivers. The switch to drip irrigation will have to be made stringent.Minister of State for Water Conservation Vijay Shivtare, representing the Shiv Sena argued, At Latur, water supply is once in 21 days. Even during monsoon water supply is once in eight to ten days. Yet, there are several sugar mills prospering with highest production of cane and sugar.He said, At Latur, sugar mills directly lift water from Manjara river and dam to their fullest capacity. As a result, it leads to shortage of water for drinking purposes. He said, Today, Latur with 5 lakh population is demanding Rs 700 crore for bringing water to city from Ujjani dam. There is no water shortage in Manjara dam and river. We have to set our priorities and plan for public at large and not serve only sugar mills interest. We have to first store water for drinking purpose and then use the rest for sugar cane.But exactly the opposite is happening in Latur.All district collectors have been asked to work out a plan on the water audit along with restricting its use for domestic, agriculture and industry. All drought districts have several sugar mills. Solapur tops with 32 mills.Fadnavis said at the internal meeting, While government is pursuing the policy and projects to make the state self reliant in water, it cannot overlook the immediate concerns of people. Moreover, a drought-free Maharashtra in 2019 will require scientific water management.Based on geographical conditions in every district, the ministry of agriculture is evolving multi-crops with shorter cycle to facilitate quick returns with less water utility. Osmanabad district which receives an average rain less than 450 mm, has started looking at lucrative crops/ horticulture farming to replace cane cultivation. Instead of 12-14 months cycle for sugar cane, farmers in small groups are experimenting with horticulture which is equally remunerative.As district collector Prashant Narnavre said,  If the returns are high, farmers are willing to experiment with new crops specially in rain shadow areas.Taking up the centres special drive to promote pulses and oilseeds, the state government wants farmers to avail schemes to the optimum. Both pulses and oilseeds require lesser water compared to cane.The processing of one kg sugar, from cultivation to crushing, requires 3,500 litres of water. However, unlike pulses and oilseeds, cane growing is less risky as it ensures assured returns and can sustain a gap of 15 to 20 days without water.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo) At the recent RSS conclave. (Express Photo)The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is now determined to make inroads into western Maharashtra, which has always remained the traditional bastion of the Congress-NCP in the state. The sugar belt of the state wields 72 Assembly seats, out of the total 288.Last week, the RSS made a big bang with 1.57 lakh swayamsevaks marching on the 450-acre land in Marunji village in the Hinjewadi outskirts of Pune.RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat addressed the mammoth gathering, imparting lessons on unity in diversity and evoking principles of cultural nationalism and integral humanism. The stress on samrasta equality and inclusivity was specially emphasised on the day.The Congress and the NCP leaders believe it would be a wake-up call for the Opposition as the RSS stronghold in western Maharashtra would culminate in BJP reaping the electoral dividends ahead. Both Congress and NCP leaders are to convene a meeting to discuss the possible ramifications of the RSS conclave and draw up a strategy to counter it effectively after January 15.Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, The big question we would ask people is, do they want to subscribe to secular or communal politics in Maharashtra? Yet, Congress-NCP leaders admit, if the RSS gains foothold, it would be a challenge to their socio-economic politics.At the outset, RSS leaders termed the conclave as part of their ongoing programme. But an insider associated with the RSS and BJP revealed, It was a well-calculated exercise undertaken by the RSS to penetrate into the Congress-NCP bastion in western Maharashtra.The RSS conclave helped the organisation attract swayamsevaks from 6,700 villages out of a total 9,600 villages in the region. RSS coordinator Sarang Wable said, The purpose of the meet was to project the RSS positively to the people.Notwithstanding the RSSs decision to underplay the larger agenda, sources in the BJP revealed, The gathering of RSS in the backdrop of a magnificent stage carved as Chhatrapati Shivajis Raigad Fort and theme titled as Shiv Shakti holds special social and political significance.The objective is to ensure greater acceptance of RSS amongst the OBC and Maratha community, which dominates politics in the western Maharashtra belt. It is also perceived as part of the social engineering of forward and backward communities in RSS.The meticulous planning of the RSS also reflects as it chose the venue, which has evolved as the IT hub of Maharashtra drawing huge floating professional and the tech-savvy generation next across the state.An event manager admitted, For the first time, RSS made use of IT in planning the entire event. From enrollment of candidates to reaching out ganvesh (uniform), all details were available online.A senior BJP leader associated with the planning informed, Ever since its inception in 1925, RSS has never succeeded in making deep inroads in western Maharashtra. The Congress-NCP with their cooperative movement had always retained complete hold on the masses across Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Solapur and Ahmednagar. The cooperative movement with huge socio-economics helped them to reign the politics of Maharashtra.A sources revealed, RSS, which has also made inroads in the rest of Maharashtra with social works through 178 organisations has never been able to gain foothold in western Maharashtra.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Arul Horizon) Maharashtra has been assigned the highest export quota of 14 lakh metric tonnes. (Arul Horizon)The central governments decision last year to impose a compulsory export quota for mills would have a double whammy effect on them, say millers.Apart from a loss of approximately Rs 400 per quintal of sugar exported that they could incur, mills in Maharashtra would also fail to benefit from a rise in sugar prices in the domestic market in the months to come.In order to sustain the price of sugar in the domestic market, the Centre had taken a decision to fix an export quota for mills across the country, based on the last three years average production. Maharashtra was assigned the highest such quota of 14 lakh metric tonnes, followed by mills in Uttar Pradesh and other states.Since Uttar Pradesh is a landlocked state where millers have to bear huge costs to transport their export consignment through ports in Mumbai and elsewhere, mills there were allowed a trade-off for sake of equalisation. As per this, UP mills could buy sugar equal to their export quota at existing domestic market prices from millers in Maharashtra, who in turn would export the same volume along with their own fixed quota.As international sugar prices have been lower than the domestic prices, it results in a loss of Rs 200-400 per quintal for exporting millers. But the bigger question, especially for millers in Marathwada and Solapur, is that due to the drought, production has been less this season as compared to last three years.The matter was raised before the chief minister last week by the millers, especially from the Solapur and Marathwada regions, who are expecting a decision from the government to lower their export quotas.Till the end of February this year, around 12 lakh tonnes of sugar has been exported out of the country, of which mills in Maharashtra have exported close to 6 lakh tonnes. Around3 lakh tonnes of the exported sugar was from their own quota while the rest was a result of the trade-off with mills in UP.However, industry insiders from Kolhapur pointed out how this scheme would affect millers in the state, both in the short and long term. The 2016-17 crushing season for Maharashtra is supposed to be bleak with a reduction in cane area. As the mills from Maharashtra are exporting both their own as well as the trade-off quota for UP mills, they would not be able to encash on the domestic market where prices are expected to rise well, said a prominent miller from Kolhapur. Data from the NCDEX index shows prices of sugar in July are expected to be above Rs 3,400 per quinital with October prices promising to touch Rs 3,500 per quintal.The recent report on sugar production prepared by the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) shows that barring Maharashtra, all other states have registered slight increase in their sugar production figures. As of February 29, Maharashtra produced 70.40 lakh tonnes of sugar while last year on the same day, ie February 28, 2015, the state had produced 74.74 lakh tonnes of sugar.Uttar Pradesh has seen production of 53.65 lakh tonnes of sugar till the end of February while last year, it had produced 49.59 lakh tonnes of sugar till February-end. While the cane outlook for Maharashtra for the season 2016-17 is bleak, the same for Uttar Pradesh is good, with the state expecting a good crop.B B Thombare, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA), said millers had been assured by the chief minister that they would be allowed to export based on the present days quota only. Export would help in keeping the domestic prices up, he said.However, the official notification about the reduction of the export quota is yet to be issued.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

It means a total ban on allowing digging of new wells in the drought-hit villages.In Solapur, district collector Tukaram Mundhe has evolved a new model to beat the drought. To begin with, he has declared 12,000 water structures including rig wells, tube wells and ponds for solely drinking water purpose for the public. It is almost double compared to 6,400 acquired last year.The decision comes with a rider that none of these water structures would be allowed for commercial activities or even agriculture beyond one km. In every village, the gram panchayat and local bodies are being roped in to ensure strict implementation.At the drought review meeting held at Latur, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has urged district collectors to evolve plans for the next four months to sustain water and fodder supply across villages reeling under drought. Along with supply of water and fodder, simultaneous plans to proactively check further water depletion and recharging water to raise water tables should become compulsory.Sinking underground water tables need to be tackled with the highest priority, Fadnavis had said.Mundhe said, We are planning a two-pronged strategy keeping in mind the next four months till June. We are making provisions for water with the existing infrastructure which can take care of drinking water shortage. Maintaining that tankers would be deployed only in places where absolutely essential, he indicated that wasteful expenditure which does not help villages would be ended.In Solapur, almost 700 villages out of 1,144 face water scarcity. At present, there are not more than 10 tankers in the district. In Solapur, which houses 32 sugar mills in Maharashtra, district officials have often invited the wrath of politicians in the past, who see the drought as a business opportunity through water tanker supply to remote villages.The state government statistics for the last 14 years show that Rs 4,000 crore were spent on water supply and fodder during droughts. Yet, there were complaints of irregular water supply. While plugging loopholes in the system, district officials have now decided to opt for case-to-case study of the villages and provide solutions for specific requirements.Mundhe said, At present, we have provisions to sustain drinking water and fodder till June, except in a few patches where we might see problems in May.District officials are hopeful that there would not be any shortage of fodder in the district which has 11 lakh big and small animals. Sugarcane which has remained uncrushed after February, 2016, would work as fodder for the animals.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Singh, who has been visiting the villages where the scheme has begun in full swing, said at a speech in Mumbai University that he has already conveyed his concerns to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.I think it is a significant project for its focus on the community coming together. I have heard that in some places the Yojana is being handled by contractors. Even if there are contractors appointed, it needs to have strong community control for transparent running, Singh told The Indian Express.He also said that the budget allocated to the scheme is quite less. The scheme, advocated as a flagship programme by the CM, has been initiated in 6,200 villages so far. The government has contributed Rs 1,000 crore for its first phase, with an additional Rs 400 crore having come from community funds and CSR.Singh, who was in the city for the Reframing the Environment: Resources, Risk and Resistance in Neoliberal India seminar organised by the Department of Sociology, Mumbai University, also said that the states water situation is staring at a disaster.The states rain pattern has no relation with its crop pattern. Marathwada, which receives 200-300mm rainfall, has over 15 sugar factories and it seems that nothing is being done about it. Since independence, many agriculture ministers have come from the state with 40 per cent of the dams in the country built here. Yet, the most number of farmer suicides also are from the same state. How can this be called development, he said in his plenary speech on Thursday.Singh, who is known for reviving the age-old practice of rain water storage tanks or johads, has helped revive rivers in the arid state of Rajasthan. Also known as the waterman of India, Singh has been traveling across 17 countries in the past year to raise awareness about water rights.Commenting on COP21, he said that dialogue between the countries has become a green business. The focus has become climate mitigation while the focus needs to be climate adaptation where each country finds ways to adapt in ways possible against climate change, he said.On the debate about environment vs development when expanding infrastructure in a city like Mumbai, Singh said that the model at play in Mumbai will not survive for long.

The court has sought reply from both.The PIL, filed by Colonel (retired) Chandrashekhar Unni and activist Abhijeet Bannerjee through advocate Gunratan Sadavarte claims that 30 per cent of the milk samples tested in the state showed adulteration whereas 46 per cent samples were sub-standard.Sadavarte informed that the research was conducted by a consumer NGO  Mumbai Grahak Panchayat  between 2012 and 2015. The survey saw samples being collected in Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Raigad and Ratnagiri. Of the total samples, 30 per cent were adulterated, he argued. These samples showed that the samples were adulterated with urea, starch, sugar and water.The second issue raised in the PIL is of overcharging by milk suppliers. The PIL claims that the suppliers had written a letter to Legal Metrology Department admitting that they charge Rs 2 extra on every 1 litre packet and on a total of 45 lakh litres of milk packets.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

5935a60d7be9e061bdcfece4,Millers explore legal options against suspension of licence,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/millers-explore-legal-options-against-suspension-of-licence/,2016-01-13,"Sugar commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma continued his action against errant sugar mills in the state and millers were exploring legal options and contemplating to move court. On Tuesday, Sharma suspended crushing licences of mills managed by two senior Congress leaders in Ahmednagar district  Leader of Opposition Radhakrushna Vikhe Patil and former revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat.Non-payment of fair and remunerative price (FRP) to cane growers for last season had snowballed into a major issue in the state at the start of the crushing season. On Monday, Sharma had suspended crushing licences of 12 mills for failure to clear FRP for the last crushing season and 51 mills were issued notices on December 22. Sharmas action follows mills not clearing FRP. The total quantum of uncleared FRP for the last season, as of December 31, is around Rs 200 crore. Suspension of crushing licence leads to imposition of fines to the tune of Rs 500 per tonne of cane crushed. The mills are supposed to deposit the amount with the government treasury. In case mills fail to comply with directions they would be debarred from applying or obtaining crushing licence in the subsequent year.Meanwhile, millers said they will explore legal options against the sugar commissioners orders. On Tuesday, officials from the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation tried to meet Cooperative Minister Chandrakant Patil to discuss the matter. Shivajirao Nagavade Patil, president of the federation, said millers have decided to contest the suspension of licence either by moving court or appealing before the cooperation minister.Suspension of licence is just an act of bravado and will not do anything for farmers in reality. It would have been more prudent if the commissioner had taken action after sugar production was completed, he said.Patil said the millers will try to meet the minister again on Wednesday to try to come up with a solution. As of Tuesday, 169 mills are in operation in the state, which includes 94 cooperative mills and 75 private mills. The total cane crushed this year is 392.07 lakh tonnes.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
5935a7107be9e061bdcfed29,"A postcard from Ajit Ranade: Happy New Year, CM Fadnavis",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/a-postcard-happy-new-year-cm-fadnavis/,2016-01-07,"Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis (Source: Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar) Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis (Source: Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar)By Ajit RanadeDear Mr Fadnavis,Maharashtra is a study in contrasts. It is a rich state, yet beset by poverty. Industrial, yet plagued by agriculture woes. Has plenty of power capacity, yet has large-scale power cuts. Gets heavy downpour on the Konkan belt, yet is highly drought-prone. It is the highest contributor to national GDP and 15 per cent of industrial output. It is near the top of the charts in per capita income. But in poverty statistics, it is not even in the top ten. It has excellent connectivity, with all-weather pucca roads connecting 99 per cent of its villages and towns. But intra-regional disparity is huge. The per capita income in Gadhchiroli district is only one-fourth of that in the Mumbai region. Maharashtra is one of the most urbanised states in the country, and its cities are a magnet for intra- and inter-state migration. But its cities are not sufficiently empowered to build their own infrastructure or fund their activities. The Local Body Tax legislated to replace age-old, inefficient, corruption-prone octroi has been suspended. The state does have a healthy record in decentralised governance, but it simply isnt enough for its mammoth size. The urban-rural divide is so extreme that if you take only rural areas, the Human Development Index puts it in the bottom five among major states. Ten of its 36 districts figure among the 100 most backward districts of India.The industrial production of the state is also highly concentrated, with just three districts accounting for almost 50 per cent of the total for the state. Even the rain gods shower their blessings unequally. The coastal Konkan region receives on average 400 cm of rains, but just 100 km to the east, the rain shadow region of Sahyadri receives barely 70 cm. The state as a whole is mostly drought-prone, with a maximum irrigation potential of barely 20 per cent. Two crops illustrate the problems plaguing agriculture in Maharashtra: cotton associated with farmers suicides; and sugarcane, which is grown on 3 per cent of the land, consumes 60 per cent of the irrigation water, and is bought by mostly financially sick sugar mills.The public finances of the state are also in a worrisome state. The state debt at about Rs 3 lakh crore is growing faster than its nominal GDP. More than half of the annual state budget goes to pay salaries and pensions. Capital expenditure has to often be curtailed, affecting development and infrastructure.Against this backdrop, the development priorities before the state are self-evident. Firstly, to complete small and big irrigation projects. Implement the Shirpur pattern in all districts. This is an amazingly successful and simple method of raising the water table. Secondly, focus on state finances. Can we think of selling Sicom, and other state-owned entities? How about raising water and carbon taxes? Congestion tax? Thirdly, the development of Marathwada and Vidarbha region is an imperative. The Kelkar Committee has a blueprint that can be used. In particular, the cotton belt should also house the entire textile value chain, which will need investment and technical skill building. Fourthly, a big infrastructure push for Mumbai, to make it an international financial centre. This calls for speedy completion of the cross-harbour bridge to Nhava Sheva, more progress on Dharavi, and public transportation. Fifth, for industrial growth and employment, a hard look at all the Special Economic Zones (most not functioning), and vacant plots in MIDC zones (can state repossess and re-sell?). The state scored big in winning over Foxconn, General Motors and Posco. But more needs to be done. Even services sectors like health, education, retail and tourism have great employment potential. Sixth is crop diversification, to wean farmers away from water-guzzling sugarcane. The development mantra for the state is: more crop per drop, more output per megawatt, and more employment per investment dollar.Maharashtra enjoyed a pre-eminent place in the past, but has been slipping in recent years. It still can boast of one of the best work cultures, skills catchment and growth potential among various states. It is time for the state to reclaim the top spot.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Similarly, future prices for May and July 2016 closed at Rs 3,226 and 3,300 per tonne.Both prices and volume of sugar on the NCEDX market over the last few days have seen a high, but it has done little to change the fortunes of sugar mills in Maharashtra.Millers say the majority of trading that has pushed the prices of the commodity up is due to activity of traders who are now offloading the stock which they had purchased at lower prices earlier this year.On Wednesday, future price of Sugar for March 2016 trading at the NCDEX market closed at Rs 3,150 per tonne. Similarly, future prices for May and July 2016 closed at Rs 3,226 and 3,300 per tonne.It might be recalled that sugar prices in the market has been fluctuating with July prices having gone down to Rs 1,900 per tonne. Over the last few months, sugar price has been speculative with prices coming up in the last few months.Volume-wise, December saw trading of over 8 lakh tonnes of sugar valued at Rs 2422.21 crore. Sugar trading on NCDEX platform has been steadily increasing over the last few months. November saw trading of more than 5 lakh tonnes of sugar worth over Rs 1,525 crore while in October, around 7 lakh tonnes of sugar was traded valued at Rs 1,933.72 crore. Since July last year, the NCDEX exchange has seen trading of 35 lakh tonnes of sugar with valuation of Rs 9,318.41 crore.While the sugar market remains bullish, millers say it has failed to affect them in any manner.Last season, Maharashtra saw a record production of sugar at 105.06 lakh tonnes. This season, it is expected the sugar production of the state would touch 85 lakh tonnes due to drought and other factors.Failure of millers to pay the sugar cane growers the fair and remunerative price (FRP) meant the present crushing season started with cane arrears of over Rs 1,000 crore.Although the crushing season of 2015-16 has started with full force, as many as 51 mills have been issued notices by the sugar commissioner to clear dues of over Rs 300 crore, failing which their crushing licenses would be cancelled.The state produces 37 per cent of the total sugar produced in the country.Shivajirao Nagawade, chairman of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, said the trading over the last few months have been dominated by traders. Taking advantage of the lower prices in July-August, traders had purchased the commodity and they are playing up the market now, he said.In most cases, he said, the sugar being traded was still in the mill godowns. The higher prices have failed to affect the mills. There is no lifting of sugar in the market, he said.Tenders floated by mills, he said, hardly had any takers as of now. All the trading happening now is speculative and it is making its effect on the market, he said.On an average, Maharashtra witnesses trading of around 6-7 lakh tonnes of sugar which has remained unchanged.Similarly, Madan Bhosale, chairman of the Satara-based KisanVeer Cooperative Sugar Factory, said the present trading is of the previous season with traders playing with the sentiments of the market.There is no mechanism to control such speculative trading in the markets, he said.It might be recalled speculative activities in case of pulses had also caused an artificial price rise in the market this year. Yogesh Pande, spokesperson of the Swambhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said speculative activities in the market were controlled by just a handful of traders on the commodity exchanges. Sugar will rise the pulse rate of the government in coming days if there is no intervention, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo) Gyanba Pandurang at his farm in Baramati taluka. (Express Photo)Gyanba Pandurag Dhavan (62), who owns five acres of land in Baramati taluka of Pune district, has grown only sugarcane for the last 30 years.Like other residents of Malegaon Colony village in Baramati taluka, cane has been the staple crop thanks to assured returns and lower input costs. But this may well be the last cane season for Dhavan, as the farmer now says it is no longer financially viable. The local mills have defaulted and there is no assurance of water for the next season, he says,For farmers across the state, sugarcane has offered assured returns in the form of a Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP). Sugar mills across the state are bound by the Sugarcane Control Act, 1966, to pay FRP to the growers. Any violations attract penal action against the mills. Thanks to the political patronage given to the cane crop and to mills, it has remained a favoured crop. Baramati, the home town of former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, has also seen rapid expansion of cane cultivation as well as mushrooming of sugar mills. Thats also because farmers here never had to reckon with the problem of water, thanks to an extensive network of canals in this belt.However, as Dhavan puts it, there are now challenges with mills defaulting on payments and with worsening water scarcity. Dhavan had send around 90 tonnes of cane to the local Malegaon Cooperative Sugar Mill last year but is yet to receive the full payment. We were paid Rs 2,200 per tonne as the first installment, but the full payment is yet to reach us, he says. Dhavan had taken a bank loan of Rs 5 lakh and is now finding himself stretched to repay it. Agriculture is our only source of income but that is not feasible now, he says.Share This Article Related Article Bitter Truth: Early summer heat dries up recovery hopes for sugar in MaharashtraBitter Truth: Early summer heat dries up recovery hopes for sugar in Maharashtra Sugarcane: Average fair and remunerative price clocks four-year highSugarcane: Average fair and remunerative price clocks four-year high From bitter to sweet: Behtar din for sugarcane growers, finallyFrom bitter to sweet: Behtar din for sugarcane growers, finally Relief to sugar sector, no purchase tax next seasonRelief to sugar sector, no purchase tax next season Tackling Drought: Govt wants Marathwada to move away from water-guzzling caneTackling Drought: Govt wants Marathwada to move away from water-guzzling cane Failing farmers put all eggs in cane basketIn Baramati, water scarcity is a growing issue as parts of the state suffer one of its worst ever spells of drought.

The dams are empty and there would be no water for the next season also, he says.For growing an acre of cane, Dhavan said he has to invest close to Rs 50,000. I have left my fields lie fallow and didnt plant cane for the upcoming year. We have planned to divert to gram instead as it has low water requirement. If that happens, it will be first time in three decades that Dhavans fields will not see a sugarcane crop.Asked if he would go back to cultivating cane later, Dhavan had says: Cane is the only crop which has assured returns.

Though I dont share your partys Hindutva ideology, I am your admirer. In you, the state has got a youthful, studious chief minister with a clean image and transparent sincerity. People of Maharashtra want you to succeed. But succeed in what?I have a small wish list of two.Vidarbha and Marathwada regions in Maharashtra, with nearly 45 million population, deserve your highest attention. Farmers suicides  largest in the world, Naxalism and tribal unrest, child malnutrition and mortality, water scarcity and drought in these regions are manifestations of the underlying imbalance in political power and economic development of five decades. You have openly stated your commitment to undo this injustice. How?A Constitutional amendment, Article 371(2), protects the welfare of Vidarbha and Marathwada. Under this, the governor of Maharashtra appointed in 2011 the high-level Kelkar Committee to suggest solutions for the problem of imbalance in regional development in the state. You, as the leader of all party MLAs from Vidarbha, made an impressive and convincing presentation before the committee. It is still fresh in my memory.The Kelkar Committee has recommended several deep structural and financial reforms. These include devolution of administrative and financial power to the regions, a fund allocation formula to correct the development deficit in Vidarbha and Marathwada, measures to encourage the growth of industry and agriculture in these two regions, solutions to the problem of water scarcity and the irrigation deficit, creation of new districts and talukas with a tribal majority, and implementation of the PESA Act empowering the tribal villages.Your government has a singular opportunity to solve multiple problems in one stroke. Lead the state in implementing these recommendations. Even the Shiv Sena, hopefully, will not oppose them because this might be the only way to avoid the otherwise inevitable division of the state.Another problem is insidiously eroding Maharashtras main capital  the human capital. The state population is known for its intelligence, culture and enlightenment. However, it is celebrating the New Year with a week drowned in alcohol. People annually drink liquor worth Rs 50,000 crore. The state is unofficially governed by an alcohol empire which has permeated the political power in villages and towns, in the sugar industry, in political parties and finally made even the state government dependent on the revenue earned from liquor. In a recent debate on Zee TV, your excise minister replied to me that this year he hoped to collect Rs 21,000 crore from the sale of alcoholic drinks. No government should be proud of this dubious achievement.The Global Burden of Disease study counts alcohol among the top four causes of diseases. Women are insecure if men are drunk (remember the Nirbhaya episode). The youth has started drinking at the age of 15 years.I am sure you do not want the state to go the Punjab way. I hope the voices of women from different parts of the state  Chandrapur, Yavatmal, Buldhana, Ahmednagar, Satara, Kolhapur  loudly protesting against liquor are reaching you. What should you do about this corrosive problem?The World Health Assembly has resolved in 2009 that the member countries should institute policies and measures to reduce the harm caused by alcohol. France, Italy and Russia have introduced the measures and reduced consumption. Recently in India, the states of Kerala and Bihar have announced a decision to introduce prohibition. What will the enlightened state of Maharashtra do?I suggest that Maharashtra should adopt a policy which protects the long-term welfare, health and development of the people. Adopt a policy of incremental reduction in liquor availability and consumption in the state. Twenty percent reduction per year will give everybody the required time to adjust.Moreover, the three districts  Wardha, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur  where the government has already introduced prohibition should see an effective implementation. You have already approved such a plan for Gadchiroli district. I congratulate you for that.In the end, a personal request. Do take care of your own health. You are young, but your inhuman time schedule and excruciating pressures worry me. Maharashtra needs you for a longer innings.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Vishwanath Nagare, a farmer from a village near Lasalgaon, with his stored rabi onion crop. (Express Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Its roughly a month since Vishwanath Nagare harvested his rabi onion crop, but he is yet to take it to the market.Prices are now just Rs 800 per quintal. I wont sell until they at least cross Rs 1,000, says this farmer from Sarole Thadi, a village in Nashik districts Niphad taluka just about 18 km Lasalgaon that houses Indias largest wholesale onion market.Last year, Nagare, who grows onion in one out of his total five-acre holding, realised an average rate of Rs 1,300 per quintal. But he could sell only six tonnes, as the crop itself suffered damage from unseasonal rains in March. This time, he has produced 11 tonnes, but prices are lower: If they dont improve soon, I will lose money yet again.There are many farmers like Nagare, who are unable to fathom the wild fluctuation in onion prices over the last year and more. Between April and September, the average modal price  the rate at which the maximum number of trades happen  in Lasalgaon soared from Rs 1,093 to Rs 4,130 per quintal. For a brief period, during the third week of August, they even hit Rs 5,000-5,000/quintal levels. That was, of course, the time when pyaaz was all over the newspapers and TV channels. The price spiral was partly a result of Indias onion output dropping to 189.28 lakh tonnes (lt) in 2014-15, from the preceding years 194.02 lt, and also average monthly exports of over one lt per month during January-July 2015.Share This Article Related Article Demonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangsDemonetisation on the ground: Onion growers suffer labour pangs As onion prices plunge to decade low, farmers take to sit-insAs onion prices plunge to decade low, farmers take to sit-ins As onion prices dip, Maharashtra government declares Re 1/kg as subsidyAs onion prices dip, Maharashtra government declares Re 1/kg as subsidy Price crash: Onions bring tears, this time to farmersPrice crash: Onions bring tears, this time to farmers The Failing Fields: From mango to sugar, its a bitter storyThe Failing Fields: From mango to sugar, its a bitter story Onion growers in tearsBut since December  with the arrival of the 2015-16 kharif and late-kharif crops  prices have been on a downward slope, falling below Rs 1,000 per quintal by early February. The new rabi onion crop hitting the market after harvesting during March-May has taken prices even lower; they fell to Rs 600 per quintal levels in mid-March, before recovering a tad thereafter. The resultant distress to farmers is hardly making headlines.What farmers here are unable to comprehend is how prices have crashed, that too in the midst of a drought of the kind Maharashtra is currently seeing. Rabi onion area in the state, in fact, has dipped to around 1,90,000 hectares this year, as against over 3,42,000 hectares in 2014-15. According to Nanasaheb Patil, chairman of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, the decline would have steeper but for some extra area being sown under the crop in Ahmednagar and Aurangabad. Towards November-end, water from the Gangapur dam in Nashik was released for Marathwada. As this water passed through Ahmednagar and Aurangabad, farmers along the canal uprooted their ratoon sugarcane and planted onion in its place, he points out.The sugar commissionerates data shows a 40 per cent acreage reduction under ratoon cane  which grows from the stubble of the harvested plant crop  this time in Maharashtra. Kashinath Sanap from Baktarpur village of Ahmednagars Kopargaon taluka is among those who decided to divert four acres of his cane area to onion. There was no water to sustain a 12-month ratoon cane crop. So, I went for rabi onion, he says. But he, too, is disappointed that the crop is selling in Kopargaon at below Rs 700 per quintal.Patil believes that the Lasalgaon market is now witnessing a heavy influx of onions from Ahmednagar and Aurangabad  which is also the reason for prices plunging. These farmers, unlike the ones in the traditional onion belt of Nashik, Pune and Dhule, have no facilities for on-field storage. So, they have no option but sell at the earliest, he notes.Farmers in the main onion belt have the capacity to hold back their crop a little longer. But even they, Patil admits, cannot expect prices to go up much, especially with onion acreages in other states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan rising significantly. The Nashik-based National Horticultural Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) has estimated this years rabi onion crop to be 15-20 per cent higher, with overall production for 2015-16 pegged at 203 lt.Rabi onions have longer shelf life and are amenable to storage. NHRDF has projected that around 45 lt of rabi onions would be stored by farmers and traders in the current marketing season due to availability of good quality bulbs. This is more than the 40 lt from last years rain and hail-damaged crop.Farmers in Nashik, Pune and Dhule alone have constructed storage capacities aggregating some 14 lt. Such on-farm structures, typically of 25-30 tonnes capacity and costing a couple of lakhs, have been built through special subsidies from NABARD and the state agriculture department. But farmers hopes of making money from stored onions, this time, have been dashed by crashing prices, for which they largely blame theCentres move to impose minimum export price (MEP) restrictions on onion. During the price surge in August, the MEP was hiked to $700 per tonne, putting a virtual halt on shipments.As domestic prices went into free fall, the MEP was eventually scrapped on December 23. But for farmers, who were harvesting their kharif onions, it was too late.Omprakash Raka, a trader-cum-exporter from Nashik, recalls that till about 6-7 years back, NAFED used to have monthly meetings with all concerned stakeholders to take regular stock of the onion supply position. These interactions allowed informed decisions, including that on MEP, to be taken. But that practice has been replaced by fixing of MEPs in an ad hoc manner, he claims. The main beneficiaries of Indias MEP restrictions have been exporters in China, Egypt and Pakistan. They have all reported good crops this year, even as India is struggling to regain its lost market share from these players.The Centre has now directed NAFED and other state agencies to procure 15,000 tonnes. NAFED is expected to start procurement from April 18, with the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board and others to wade in towards May. This, it is hoped, would help push up realisations above Rs 1,000 per quintal. But unlike last year, the chances of any price spiral seem remote.While that may be good news for urban consumers, for Maharashtras farmers this would translate into yet another cycle of losses. Santosh Gorade from Takli village in Niphad taluka has stored around 6.5 tonnes of his produce in anticipation of higher prices. He sums up the situation best: Temperatures here have already crossed 40 degrees Celsius. If they continue at this level, the bulbs will start rotting, forcing us to go for distress sale. There was no acche din for us last year and we dont see it this season as well.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

However, we are not considering a complete prohibition as of now, he said. Mungantiwar said aspects like Excise revenue, economics of the sugar industry, health issues involved with alcohol consumption and pressure from the NGOs and activists like Hazare need to be considered before taking any decision over the issue.We get a revenue of around Rs 13,000 crore every year from sale of alcohol. Officials say that if we adopt the Tamil Nadu pattern and ban country liquor we may increase revenue, he said.Tamil Nadu has banned country liquor and replaced it with a cheaper version of foreign liquor branded by the state. All liquor shops are owned by the government which generates a total revenue of around Rs 23,000 crore, the minister said.Hazare had recently met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and submitted a letter demanding liquor prohibition in Maharashtra. He blamed alcoholism as one of the major causes for the brutal rape of a minor in Kopardi, Ahmednagar.NCP MLC Prakash Gajbhiye too had demanded prohibition of countrymade and foreign liquor in the state.If Bihar could decide on banning alcohol thereby suffering Rs 3,000 crore loss, why cant a progressive state like Maharashtra do it as well.

(PTI Photo)The blinding neon flashes followed by deafening thunder cracking across the night sky and the subsequent torrent on Monday brought smiles to the faces of 73-year-old Raman Yadav and 21-year-old Pawan Sharma in eastern Uttar Pradeshs floundering sugar bowl Kushinagar.The morning after farmers of Kushinagar and its adjoining Deoria districts, reeling under scanty rains for three consecutive years, have warmed up, albeit with a healthy dose of scepticism, to Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhis promise on the first day of his 2,500-long kisan padyatra that farm loans will be waived off.On a leisurely stroll near Rahuls second khaat sabha on Monday, Yadav, who is mulling to give Congress a shot in the next polls, speaks on politics with a careless abandon, providing pithy insights. His family owns 3 bigha land, which he says provide just about sustenance.Munde munde matir bhinna (perspectives differ from one person to another), he says, when asked why a group of youth, huddled across the road, are rather willing to give Modiji and Yogi Adityanath a chance, mainly to bring down crime in the region.But despite his personal liking for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sharma, who is in BSc third year, is somewhat receptive to Rahuls repeated assertions, in meeting after meeting, that Congress will ensure that farm loans are waived off like the UPA government had done in the fag-end of its first term.WATCH VIDEO: Rahul Gandhi Kicks Off Kisan YatraMy father is a sugarcane farmer so I know the plight of their lot. But such promises (Rahuls) more often than not ring hollow. Modijis promise on black money has also come out a cropper till now but at least we can see attempts being made, Pawan says.But the concern over rising cases of crime cuts across age groups as Ambika Chaudhary, in his early sixties, echoes Pawans view that there indeed has been an alarming spurt, especially of lootings and snatchings.Rahuls kisan padyatra outreach, which will meander across the eastern UP districts in its first leg, is aimed at gaining the support of these distressed farmers, which Congress believes will boost the partys prospects in the 2017 assembly election in the state.No wonder, the Congress scions chopper landed on a makeshift helipad at Pachladi Kritpura village, that houses a large number of sainthwar community people (OBC) battling bad crop fallout, of Deorias Rudrapur constituency.Rahul visited five houses in the village that lacks a pucca road and power supply is as elusive as the rains. He interacted with the familes of Hanskumar Singh, Pradyuman Singh, Sadasya Singh (brothers) and Om Prakash Singh, who in turn apprised him of the amount they owe in form of outstanding loan dues.Kushinagar and Deoria were among the 50 districts that were declared as drought-hit by the Uttar Pradesh government last year.One senior Congress leader, accompanying Rahul, explained the partys attempt to reach out to the farming community was crucial for it to even make a splash in the 403-member UP Assembly where it currently has a paltry 29 MLAs.The 2008 farm loan waiver had reaped the maximum dividends for Congress in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. In the same way, this could very well be our trump card. What cannot be overlooked is that the crisis of sugarcane farmers is real and the mills owe them thousands of crores, the leader says.State Advisory Price (SAP) of cane has remained unchanged at Rs 280 per quintal in Uttar Pradesh, the countrys second-largest sugar producer, for the last four years.I had to take a loan of Rs 25,000 this June due to successive years of scanty rainfall. Rahulji met me and assured me that he will ensure that this amount is waived off. I signed the mangpatra (charter of demand) in his presence, Om Prakash says.The marginal farmer, a self-confessed Congress loyalist, also enthusiastically points out that Rahul also spoke to his daughter Archita.He spoke to me and I told him that I want to be a chemist. He wanted to know why not a doctor and I said because of lack of money, 16-year-old Archita says.What was Rahuls reply, the reporters ask in chorus. Wo kuch nahi bole, she walks off and so do the reporters.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

593bb25f7be9e04956d77a8b,The internationalisation of genocide,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-internationalisation-of-genocide/article14746537.ece,2016-08-12,"Fidel Castro RuzThe colossal squandering of cereals for fuel production will serve to save rich countries less than 15 per cent of the annual consumption of their voracious automobiles.AT A recent meeting at Camp David between the Presidents of the United States and Brazil, no one answered the following questions. Where will the more than 500 million tonnes of corn and other cereals, which the U.S., Europe and other wealthy nations need to produce the quantities of ethanol that their big companies demand in exchange for voluminous investments, be produced? Where will the soy, sunflower, and rapeseed that these nations are to turn into fuel, come from?Some countries export their food surpluses. Others face a precarious situation as food prices skyrocket. According to recent data, the five chief producers of corn, barley, sorghum, rye, millet, and oats that President Bush wants to transform into raw material for ethanol production supply the world with 679 million tonnes of them. Similarly, the five chief consumers, some of which also produce the grain, currently need annually 604 million tonnes of them. The available surplus is then less than 80 million tonnes.The colossal squandering of cereals for fuel production and these estimates do not include oilseeds will serve to save rich countries less than 15 per cent of the annual consumption of their voracious automobiles.At Camp David, President Bush declared his intention to apply the formula around the world. This spells the internationalisation of genocide.In statements published by Washington Post on the eve of the Camp David meeting, Brazilian President Lula affirmed that less than 1 per cent of Brazil's arable land is used to grow cane destined for ethanol production. This is nearly three times the land surface Cuba used when it produced nearly 10 million tonnes of sugar a year, before the crisis that befell the Soviet Union and the onset of climate change.Cuba has been producing and exporting sugar for a longer time. First, it depended on the work of slaves, whose numbers swelled to over 300,000 in the first years of the 19th century and who turned the Spanish colony into the world's No 1 exporter. Nearly a hundred years later, at the beginning of the 20th century, when Cuba was a pseudo-republic that was denied full independence by U.S. interventionism, it was immigrants from the West Indies and illiterate Cubans who bore the burden of growing and harvesting sugarcane on the island. The scourge of our people was the off-season, inherent in the cyclical nature of the harvest. Sugarcane plantations were the property of U.S. companies or powerful Cuba-born landowners. Cuba, thus, has more experience than anyone else with regard to the social impact of this crop.On our poor and anything but consumerist island, one will be unable to find enough workers to endure the rigours of the harvesting and to care for the sugarcane plantations during the ever- more intense heat, drought or rain. When hurricanes lash the island, not even the best machines can harvest the bent-over and twisted cane. For centuries, the practice of burning sugarcane was unknown and soil was not compacted under the weight of complex machines and enormous trucks. Nitrogen, potassium, and phosphate fertilizers, that are today extremely expensive, did not exist. And the dry and wet months succeeded each other regularly. In modern agriculture, high yields are not possible without crop rotation.Impact of climate changeAccording to a United Nations report, climate change will have a significant impact on the American continent, generating more violent storms and heat waves and causing droughts, the extinction of some species and even creating hunger in Latin America. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that by the end of this century, every hemisphere will face water-related problems, and that if governments do not act, rising temperatures could increase the risks of mortality, contamination, natural catastrophes and infectious diseases.In Latin America, global warming is melting glaciers in the Andes and threatening the Amazon forest, whose perimeter may slowly be turned into a savannah, it has been reported. Because a great part of its population lives near the coast, the U.S. is also vulnerable to extreme natural phenomena, as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated in 2005.The U.N. report points out that, even if radical measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are taken, the rise in temperatures around the planet in the coming decades is unavoidable.As was to be expected, at the Camp David meeting, Dan Fisk, National Security Adviser for the region, declared that ""in the discussion on regional issues, [I expect] Cuba to come up (... ) if there's anyone that knows how to create starvation, it's Fidel Castro. He also knows how not to do ethanol.""I should remind him that Cuba's infant mortality rate is lower than that of the U.S. All citizens in Cuba enjoy free medical services. Everyone has access to education and no one is denied employment in spite of nearly half a century of economic blockade and U.S. attempts to starve and economically asphyxiate the people of Cuba.China will not devote a single tonne of cereals or leguminous plants to the production of ethanol, and it is an economically prosperous nation that is breaking growth records. In China, all citizens earn the income they need to purchase essential consumer items, despite the fact that 48 per cent of its 1.3-billion-plus population works in agriculture. On the contrary, it has set out to reduce energy consumption by shutting down thousands of factories that consume unacceptable levels of electricity and hydrocarbons. It imports many food products.Scores of countries do not produce hydrocarbons and are unable to produce corn and other grain or oilseeds, for they do not have enough water to meet even their basic needs.At a meeting on ethanol production held in Buenos Aires by the Argentine Oil Industry Chamber and Cereals Exporters Association, Loek Boonekamp, the Dutch head of the commercial and marketing division of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), told the press that governments are enthused about this process but that they should objectively consider whether ethanol should be given such resolute support. According to Mr. Boonekamp, the U.S. is the only country where ethanol can be profitable; without subsidies no other country can make it viable.Today, developed countries are pushing to have biofuels mixed with fossil fuels by around 5 per cent and this is already affecting agricultural prices. If this figure goes up to 10 per cent, 30 per cent of the U.S.' and 50 per cent of Europe's cultivated surface will be needed to meet the demand. That is why Mr. Boonekamp is asking himself whether the process is sustainable, as an increase in the demand for crops destined for ethanol production will generate higher, and less stable, prices.By simply replacing incandescent bulbs with fluorescent ones, millions of dollars in investment and energy could be saved without the need to use a single acre of farmland.The worst may be yet to come: a new war aimed at securing gas and oil supplies that can take humanity to the brink of total annihilation. Where shall poor Third World countries find the basic resources needed to survive? I am not exaggerating or using overblown language. I am confining myself to the facts. As can be seen, the polyhedron has many dark faces.(The writer is the President of Cuba.)"

They did not get salaries for the last eight months and the repeated requests for its reopening fell on deaf ears of the rulers, he said.Disputing with the governments declaration that farmers were reluctant to grow sugarcane, he said that when the JAC went round the villages the peasants expressed their willingness to plant cane if the factory was reopened. He sought to remind the Government its written reply to the High Court for the revival of the factory. Headvised the government to act positively before it attracts public wrath.

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has issued a notice to the mill, the district Collector said when contacted. The villagers, along with the Art of Living organisation, built this cement nullah bund at a cost of Rs 6 lakh. It is the only source of drinking water for the village. After it was built last August, the water lasted us entire year, said advocate Jabbar Pathan, a resident.In the first week of this month, molasses from Rena sugar mill were unscrupulously discharged into the stream,which has left the water unfit for drinking and destroyed the aquatic life in the reservoir, he added. Bhagwat Mane, deputy sarpanch, claimed that the authorities were reluctant to take action against the mill. We have no option but to depend on tankers for the drinking water now. In spite of writing a letter to the collector on August 8 and tehsildar on August 12, no action has been taken, Mane said.Latur district collector Pandurang Pole said the MPCB had issued a notice to the mill. It is true that Rena cooperative sugar mill has discharged molasses into the water which caused pollution. We have received complaints from villagers, but as the issue was not under my jurisdiction, we informed the MPCB which issued a notice to the mill, he said. We have decided to provide the village with a specialwater supply scheme, and I will make sure that the mill bears the cost of it.

The markets are shut and villagers are sitting in the shopfronts, huddled in groups. Young boys stand guard at roadblocks, made of stones, bricks and chopped trees. There is no phone connection, cable TV, local newspaper or the Internet. At some places, power has been cut off. Having failed to quell the mass protests following the killing of Kashmiri militant Burhan Wani, even police, paramilitary and Army have been withdrawn, to lessen the chances of a confrontation.However, in the complete blockade encircling south Kashmir, there is no shortage of news. It comes by word of mouth, and it only serves to fuel a demand now heard all around: azaadi.WATCH VIDEO: Kashmir Protests Victim: 5-Year Old Zohra On How She Got HitOnly azaadi, says Abdul Rashid, a schoolteacher in Urwan Poshwan village. Dont write we asked for government probe into killings of our young men or sought any concessions from Mehbooba Mufti or her government. For the last several years, we have tried everything. We held on to straws, hoping for resolution of the Kashmir issue. We put our hope in talks. We put our hopes in the promises of politicians. But now we are ashamed of having trusted the lies of the Peoples Democratic Party, like we once trusted the lies of National Conference.Beneath the debris of police stations, paramilitary camps and government buildings, destroyed by protesters in the last week here, lie the ruins of this narrative of a middle ground, of the healing touch, of slogans like goli se nahi boli se (with dialogue, not bullets) that the PDP has crafted since its inception in 1999.Protesters attack a security bunker in north Kashmirs Bandipora district on Monday. Protesters attack a security bunker in north Kashmirs Bandipora district on Monday.South Kashmir has been the PDPs political bastion, with its top leaders billing the partys soft separatist position of self-rule as an achievable political goal, between the idealistic idea of azaadi and the call for integration into the Indian Union. In the days since Burhan Wanis killing, that ground is slipping fast from beneath the PDPs feet.Like in 1990 when azaadi was a rallying cry across Kashmir, the story on the ground here is again black and white.WATCH VIDEO: Kashmir Protests: Visuals Of Curfew In the StateUrwan is a tiny hamlet in Pulwama district, 20 km from Srinagar city. Unlike many neighbouring villages, Urwan did not have a martyrs graveyard. Last Sunday, a part of the village graveyard was reserved when 15-year-old local boy Irfan Manzoor Malik was buried there.Irfan is our first martyr, says Bilal Ahmad, 22, a student. And we know now that we will need a martyrs graveyard.Read | Caught in Valley protests, Kashmiri Pandits pack bags, head to JammuHe recalls that on that Sunday, villagers had gathered for another day of protests. A CRPF convoy passed by and we shouted slogans and threw stones at them. They started firing and we ran away. In an alley, we saw Irfan lying in a pool of blood. He was hit by only one bullet, in his head, says Ahmad.Son of the village baker, Irfan was in Class IX. Irfans grandfather Abdul Gani Malik (80) sits on the verandah of their single-storey house with the neighbours. They killed a child There is no pain greater than losing your child in such a brutal way, he says. It has opened our eyes regarding those who had promised us greener pastures during the elections.Watch Video: Whats making newsThere is no ambiguity now, agrees Altaf Ahmad. No one among us is the PDP or NC now. We all want azaadi.Pushing aside his hookah, Irfans grandfather leans forward to add that he had nine grandchildren, of whom only eight are left. Each of them is a Burhan now. Burhan too was harassed and tortured when he was a 15-year-old boy. His brother was killed. His father was beaten up. But he stood up to fight and showed us that all these, the PDP, NC people who claim to be our own, are nothing but agents of our killers, he seethes.Pulwama Deputy Commissioner Muneer-ul-Islam admits Irfans killing was avoidable and says he had raised it with the government.Read | Kashmir unrest: Two more dead, PDP MLA attackedA few miles away, in Kisrigam, villagers have put up a shamiana in the compound of the local school.

Each time we believed their promises, and each time they betrayed us. Today it is Mehbooba Mufti sitting on that chair under whose stumps our boys are killed. Tomorrow it will be Omar Abdullah.People who canvassed for the PDP recently are among those sitting in the room. They say they have nothing to do with the party any more.The youngsters have shown us the way. They understand the lies better than the old men, says Bashir Ahmad, 33.The villagers are as angry with the Hurriyat Conference, saying the separatists have plans only for themselves. This new movement has erupted in spite of them (Hurriyat), a villager says.Five kilometres away from Pulwama town, that is entirely shut, a group of boys has blocked the road at Tahab village. Over 180 people were injured in the first three days of protests here.A government official, Fayaz Ahmad Sheikh says everyone is a part of the protests, that among those injured is a doctor. There is a consensus that there is no option but to seek azaadi. The PDP had made inroads here, but it is over. We will show you how we have turned (last times) polling booth into a latrine here.Nine kilometres ahead, the paramilitary and Special Operations Group camp in Litter village, broken and burnt, stands testimony to this anger.

593d32a57be9e00e964d5241,Beyond farming: Rural and Restless,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/maratha-farmers-protests-jobs-rural-and-restless-3055190/,2016-09-29,"Sangharsh Dongre with his father Tau Trimbak Dongre at their farm in Adhegaon village, Solapur. (Express Photo: Nirmal Harindran) Sangharsh Dongre with his father Tau Trimbak Dongre at their farm in Adhegaon village, Solapur. (Express Photo: Nirmal Harindran)Sangharsh Trimbak Dongre completed his Bachelor of Engineering from the S K N Sinhgad College of Engineering at Pandharpur in Maharashtras Solapur district in 2015. His family, which farms 12 acres at Adhegaon, a village in the rain shadow Mohol taluka of Solapur, spent Rs 7 lakh for his four-year undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering.More than a year later, the 24-year-old is yet to find a job and has gone back to farming. His sole consolation: Only one out of the 189 who passed out of my batch has managed to land a job at Tata Motors. The next batch, too, has graduated this year and they are all jobless like us.Watch what else is making newsSangharsh was among the lakhs of aspirant educated rural youth from the Maratha community who took part at a rally in Solapur on September 21. Such mammoth rallies have been taking place in towns and cities across Maharashtra all through this month. A central demand in these protests  by peaceful, but angry young men and women  has been reservation quotas for Marathas in government jobs and educational institutions.At the heart of the unrest is an agrarian crisis stalking Maharashtras rural countryside, stemming from shrinking landholdings over time and magnified by the back-to-back droughts and price crash  whether ofsugarcane, cotton and soybean or onion and milk  over the last two years. Coupled with the overall bleak jobs scenario and inability to cope with the high cost of education in private professional colleges, it has stoked discontent amongst the community that is being reflected in the spontaneous street actions now.Sangharshs engineering education  as of many others from his background who saw investment in higher professional studies as a passport for a future beyond agriculture  was financed largely by a loan of Rs 4 lakh from the State Bank of India. His younger brother, Vinayak, is doing his first year of BHMS (Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine & Surgery) at Sataras Sawkar Homeopathic Medical College, yet another private educational trust institution. The annual expenditure, at Rs 1.10 lakh, is lower than the Rs 1.50 lakh or so incurred for Sangharshs degree, though the course here is of four-and-a-half years followed by one year of internship.We chose BHMS because admission to a regular medicine (MBBS) course would have entailed donation of Rs 15-20 lakh on top of annual fees of Rs 4-5 lakh. Also, we decided not to go for any loan and fund from our own incomes and savings, says Sangharsh. That hasnt been easy for the family of four  including his father Tau Trimbak Dongre and mother Savita  exclusively reliant on agriculture.Till 2012, Sangharshs father grew sugarcane before shifting to pomegranate due to uncertain availability of irrigation water. Our average net yearly income has been Rs 2.5-3 lakh. The last two years have been particularly bad because of the monsoon totally failing. Although pomegranate requires less water compared to sugarcane, we have had to use tanker water for irrigation even in this case, complains Sangharsh.The familys agricultural woes, combined with the zero returns from investment in an engineering degree, have been an obvious source of frustration. All through this difficult period, Sangharsh has kept touch with his erstwhile college colleagues through a WhatsApp group, which they use to exchange notes and information on prospective job openings. Hes also part of a separate 250-member group linked to the ongoing pan-Maharashtra Maratha protests.Sangharsh relates to both the key demands expressed in the protests: Scrapping the SC & ST Prevention of Atrocities Act (which is used to harass ordinary farmers like my father), and reservations for Marathas in government educational institutions (how can we afford expensive private education with the meagre income generated from our farms?).At every rally  from Pune, Ahmednagar and Solapur to Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Latur, Nanded, Hingoli, Buldhana and Amravati  the emotive plank that has united rural Marathas is reservation. The Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM), the organisation spearheading the massive muk or silent marches, has sought to highlight the economic backwardness of the community, even though it is considered socially forward by virtue of owning much of the agricultural land in Maharashtra.We constitute a third of the states population, but three-fourths of our people are still engaged in farming where incomes are uncertain. Investment in education is the only way to secure the future of our children. That is, however, beyond the means of most rural households, points out Sachin Gaikwad, an MKM activist and sports director at the Brahmdevdada Mane Institute of Technology in Solapur.Bhanumati Pawar, who was present at the rally in Nanded where the women outnumbered men, is most concerned about the high cost of private education. If my son gets admission in any private engineering college, the minimum fees would be Rs 1.5 lakh a year. If he can secure a seat through quota in a government institution, our financial burden will reduce considerably, observes this 45-year-old, who cultivates 10 acres at a village in the outskirts of Nanded.The irony is that many of the private education institutions dotting the state are promoted by Maratha politicians, mainly from the Opposition Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Prominent names include D Y Patil, Patangrao Kadam, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Rajesh Tope and Balasaheb Thorat, each of them controlling education trusts or deemed universities running a chain of engineering, medical, pharmacy, management and other professional course colleges.These institutions were originally the offshoots of cooperative sugar mills, dairies and banks that came up across rural Maharashtra from the mid-fifties to the eighties. The founders were mostly grassroots Maratha leaders, who used the cooperatives both as vehicles for development of their regions and also for furthering their political interests. Education was an extension activity, which unfortunately degenerated into a money-making business. The public trusts that many of these leaders created effectively become private family-controlled institutions, admits a former NCP minister, who himself controls one such cooperative-cum-educational empire near Pune.The politically dominant Maratha leaders well-versed with agricultural issues are themselves responsible for the backwardness of our community, alleges Ashok Prataprao Patil, a farmer from Chakur in Latur district.According to official data, Maharashtra has 19 government and government-aided engineering institutions with an annual student intake capacity of 6,097. On the other hand, there are as many as 348 such unaided (private) institutions with an aggregate intake capacity of 1,47,770. The picture is practically the same in every other technical stream, barring medicine where the private sector has comparatively less presence.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-Shiv Sena administration has been sympathetic to the Marathas demand for reservations both in education and jobs. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has declared his governments commitment to grant reservation to the community, while noting that the students from rural areas are restless, as they cannot afford the higher fees in private colleges.At the same time, though, Fadnavis has drawn attention to the fact that even a 16 per cent quota in government engineering institutions would translate into just over 900 seats. Equal, if not more, emphasis should be laid on skill development and providing new avenues for employment in rural-based industries. The state government is working on a scheme for skill development linked to the setting up of district-level hubs for textile, food-processing and allied industries. The proposed project also aims at roping in private partners for training of rural youth, who can find employment in the units that would come up in these hubs.That, of course, is a more durable solution to a problem with both short- and long-term implications.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We may be living in a safer place now but the fear has not left my mother. She needs psychological treatment.Ikraman used to stitch clothes for fellow villagers, including Hindu customers. During the initial shock when she locked herself in for two days, the only time Ikraman spoke was to the police. It was on the basis of her complaint that police registered an FIR.The brothersNamed in FIR, he stays awayJAAN MOHD, 48, younger to Akhlaq, lives outside Bisara village, in Dadri tehsil. He has not visited Bisara since a mob damaged his vehicle a few days after his brothers murder. Today he faces an FIR registered against him and six others of the family on charges of slaughtering a calf. The Allahabad High Court has stayed the arrests of the other six but not his. I was not even in Bisara on the dates mentioned. A fair investigation will reveal the truth, he said.AFZAL AHMAD, 55, elder to Akhlaq, was not at Bisara the night his brother was killed. He has stopped visiting Bisara and lives in Dadri tehsil. Our families have got separated  some live in Delhi, others in different parts of Dadri, he said.The childrenSons head still hurts when he studies, his sister hopes to return to schoolMOHD DANISH, 23, the younger son and second of three children, is trying to crack UPSC but says his hopes are fading as the head injuries from last years attack still hinder his studies. I had another surgery 20 days ago. My head hurts and it is difficult to concentrate and read, on the computer screen or from books, he said. After recovering last year, I had still been confident about the exam, if not that year then in a couple of years. I have tried to push myself and things have improved slightly but I am not sure if I will be able to crack the exam.SHAISTA, 21, the youngest, says she had hidden with her mother and grandmother when the mob had entered, beaten up her brother Danish, left him for dead, and finally beaten their father to death. I am trying to adjust to the new life here at Subroto Park, she said. My family wants me to finish high school and I will seek admission when the process begins. We are grateful for the help that we have received from the government. We have security here at this new home but life here is very different from what it was the village.MOHD SARTAJ, 27, the eldest, was working with the Air Force in Chennai at the time his father was killed. Since transferred, he is now staying with the rest of the family in Delhi. Last year, he had said, I cannot afford to sit down and think about what happened. I feel like one of those people who are put up on a stage and they perform.The motherSent to hospital twice in 10 days as memories come flooding backASGARI, who had tried to hide along with her daughter-in-law and granddaughter, was still hit close to the eye by the mob that killed her son. More than the physical injury, what she hasnt recovered from is the sight of her son being killed. And as the anniversary approached, it ended up heightening the trauma.On Monday afternoon, Asgari was rushed to hospital with high blood pressure, sugar and exhaustion, the second time in 10 days. Her family said her health had been deteriorating as the date of the incident came closer. She has kept talking about what happened that night. Whenever someone comes to visit her, that is what they talk about, said Jaan Mohammad, one of her sons. She had been hit by the mob and her health has been deteriorating since. The trauma of seeing her son being killed in front of her eyes remains.Asgari spends most of her time with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren at their home in Subroto Park but also visits two of her other sons in Dadri. She feels she has to take care of her grandchildren in the absence of her son, Jaan Mohammad said.The other sideBisaras women threaten suicide unless their sons are releasedA YEAR after the lynching of Mohd Akhlaq in Dadris Bisara village on September 28 last year, women relatives of the 19 accused have threatened suicide unless they are released and Akhlaqs brother Jaan Mohd is arrested for allegedly killing a calf.Three of the 19 arrested are juveniles. If our children are not granted bail soon, all of us will commit suicide  either sit on an indefinite hunger strike or set ourselves on fire, said mother of Rupendra, one of the arrested. Our sons are innocent. We believed these charges will be proved false but the court has just been giving one date after another for hearing.Krishan Sisodia, whose son Puneet was arresred, said they would ensure the Samajwadi Party would not win any seat in the region. The police picked up any young man they could catch hold of, she said. Their fault was that they were living under a government which does not care about the sentiments of our community. All our children are young men, studying. A year has gone by and there is no hearing. Where do we go for justice?The demand for Jaan Mohds arrested came after a police complaint and plea in court by Bisara resident Surajpal, who alleged a stray calf had been slaughtered by Akhlaq, Jaan Mohd and other members of the family on Eid ul-Azha last year. Following an order by a local court, an FIR against Akhlaq and six others of the family had been lodged under sections of the cow slaughter and animal cruelty acts.

(File) Only a couple of other US cities have adopted a tax on sweet soda. (File)The national fight over sugary soda is bubbling up in the San Francisco Bay Area, where voters in November will consider a tax on the drinks that many health experts say contribute to diabetes, obesity and tooth decay.Backers of the campaign say a penny-per-ounce tax is needed in San Francisco, Oakland and tiny Albany to curb consumption of sweetened cola, sports drinks and canned teas that people gulp without thinking, adding empty calories.Opponents, however, say a grocery tax will lead to higher prices on other goods, hurting small businesses and customers struggling to survive in one of the countrys most expensive places. They also warn that city leaders can use the money however they want, despite talk of putting it toward health programs.We work so hard to keep the price low as much as possible, and we work every day to continue to stay in business, said Adel Alghazali, who recently talked to reporters at his produce market in the low-income Mission District.Only a couple of other U.S. cities have adopted such a tax.Voters in Berkeley approved a penny-per-ounce soda tax in 2014. And Philadelphia did so in June, taxing diet drinks as well. The American Beverage Association is suing to prevent the 1.5-cent-per-ounce tax from taking effect in January.Bay Area success this fall could tip the national conversation, said Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University and tax supporter. Voters in Boulder, Colorado, also will decide on a soda tax measure Nov. 8.Watch What Else Is Making News:Not long ago, it would have been unthinkable to tax soda, and now, not only are we thinking about it, were doing it, Gostin said.The Bay Area campaign battle is costly, with opponents funded largely by the American Beverage Association reserving nearly $10 million in television ad time. Meanwhile, soda tax advocate and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has donated about $1.7 million each to the Oakland and San Francisco campaigns.This is San Franciscos second try at a soda tax. In 2014, a similar proposal failed to get enough votes for a dedicated tax, which requires a two-thirds approval. This year, backers went for a general tax, which requires a simple majority and doesnt stipulate how the revenue is spent.The beverage industry, which spent more than $9 million to defeat the 2014 measure, has pounced on that difference with mailers saying the money could be spent on anything.Theyve also infuriated tax advocates by calling it a grocery tax, arguing business owners will be forced to raise prices on other items to spread the cost. The tax is on distributors and is not paid by customers who buy the drinks.Tax proponents have fought back with their own nonstop ads, clarifying that voters would be approving a small tax on soda _ not on everything else at the store _ that will improve the health of children and families.Both sides are courting low-income and minority voters, who tend to drink more sweetened beverages.Soda tax backers, for example, have stepped up outreach to voters in historically black and Latino neighborhoods that rejected the tax two years ago. In turn, the beverage industry has enlisted the help of store and restaurant owners in diverse and impoverished pockets of the bay.Clem Howard was among campaign volunteers canvassing the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood on a hot Saturday, checking her clipboard as she knocked on doors.Howard, who is African-American, said her mother was diagnosed with diabetes but couldnt give up drinking several cans of cola a day. She said her baby sister and brother-in-law are diabetic but still drink pop, even though her brother-in-law lost a toe to the disease.So this is very personal for me, Howard said. Thats why Im out here working so hard, sharing my story and trying to just spread the word about the impact of sugary drinks.Roughly 13 percent of African-American and Latino adults are diagnosed with diabetes, compared with 7.6 percent for whites, according to a 2014 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The American Heart Association recommends children consume less than six teaspoons of added sugar a day. A 12-ounce can of regular Coca-Cola contains nearly 10 teaspoons of sugar and 140 calories.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He claimed that the sugar mills in the state were forced to close down during the tenure of non-Congress governments.P L Punia, senior party leader and Chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, said there was a mass exodus of youth and poor from UP for want of employment as new industries were not set up in the state. The industrial zones developed during the Congress stint in power are on the brink of collapse as new industries have not come up, Punia said.Watch what else is making newsPunia alleged that the Modi government has waived loans of industrialists to the tune of Rs 10 lakh crore, however the same facility was denied to farmers. The Congress government had waived farm loans of Rs 72 lakh crore, he added. He also said that the Congress enacted the Right to Information Act, Food Security Act and the Right to Education Act, while nothing of that sort was done by the Modi government.Party MP Pramod Tewari, citing claims by BSP leaders who quit the organisation, said there was rampant corruption in ticket distribution. In an apparent reference to the reinduction of Gayatri Prajapati in the UP Cabinet, Tewari said, The corruption in SP has been accepted time to time by none else but its national president Mulayam Singh Yadav.He also accused the BJP of playing politics of hatred and said the Prime Minister has not yet fulfilled the promises he made during the Lok Sabha elections.

(Source: PTI)NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pitched for reservation for the Maratha community without diluting the quota for other communities. Meeting the Prime Minister for the first time after the Maratha agitation broke out in Maharashtra, Pawar said the community needed facilities that were available to others less privileged as a substantial section of the Marathas subsist on farming.After the meeting, Pawar told reporters that he requested for initiating a coordinated action in the Parliament in this crucial matter which pertained both to the state and central governments.The silent marches taken out by Maratha Kranti Morcha around Maharashtra to highlight demands like reservation in jobs and education have created ripples in state politics, with major players adopting a wait and watch approach to see if the massive mobilisation will eventually assume electoral dimensions.Observers say that all main partiesBJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCPare unnerved by the huge success of the rallies, the immediate trigger for them being the rape and murder of a girl from the community at Kopardi in Ahmednagar.During the meeting, Pawar also discussed the issues faced by sugarcane growers and the sugar industry.He stressed that various government decisions regarding sugar were creating difficulties for the growers to get remunerative prices of their produce.He also drew the Centres attention to the plight of sugar mills which have started cogeneration but have been hit hard by reluctance of the government to buy power from them.Cogeneration is the generation of electricity and useful heat jointly, especially the utilisation of the steam left over from electricity generation for heating.Pawar sought a review of the government policy on ethanol, saying the recent changes have affected sugar mills producing ethanol for blending it in petrol.He criticised Maharashtra Minister Mahadev Jankar for allegedly using abusive language against him but appealed to people, especially NCP workers to show restraint and not to take law into their hands.In an apparent dig at Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, he said, Everyone is awaiting the action which is being initiated against the cultured minister.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It had cited Section 17 of the Uttar Pradesh Sugarcane (regulation of supply and purchase) Act-1953, which states that a defaulter, exceeding 15 days from the date of deliver, would have to pay interest to farmers.But the cane commissioner may direct with the approval of the state government that no interest shall be paid or be paid at such reduced rate as he may fix, it adds.When contacted, Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said, Though there is such a provision, it is unethical. Year after year, how can the state waive off the interest due to farmers? Just for 2014-15 crushing season, the interest due is about Rs 700 crore.WATCH VIDEO: Surgical Strikes: Eyewitnesses Accounts Validate Indias Claim Of A Lethal StrikeA farmer leader from Pilibhit, V M Singh, said he will move court. There is no logic behind the government saying that this is being done for good of the farmers. Farmers are paying interest on loans they had taken from the cooperatives, but the government has waived off interest to be paid by sugarmill owners, who are just 35 to 40 in number, he added.When asked, Additional Commissioner (Sugarcane) V K Shukla said: The decision has been taken as per the Act. Payment to farmers is a continuous process if more sugar mills stop operation, it would affect future payments too.Thus, when the dues became very high due to a downfall in the market a few years ago, the interest was waived off to ensure the continuity of the mills as well as the payments to farmers.The interest on the dues, which have been waived off for 2014-15, will amount to around Rs 680 crore, he added.Source said while around Rs 1,500-crore dues have to be paid to farmers by the mills for the previous crushing season, Rs 54 crore has to be paid for the year before.Deepak Guptara, secretary of Uttar Pradesh Millers Association, said: During 2014-15, there was an unprecedented drop in sugar prices Grants were given by the state and Centre, but still, it was not enough to meet the losses. We had no other option but to urge the government to waive off the interest.He added that in the last few years, around 12 to 13 mills have been shut down, and bigger units are on way to close their businesses.Sugar is one of the biggest industries of UP. We contribute 11 per cent to the state GDP. To maintain the relationship between the farmers and mills, mills should at least remain alive, and this would ensure that, said Guptara.

(Source: AP) A man peaks over the crowd waiting to cross the border into Colombia through the Simon Bolivar bridge in San Antonio del Tachira, Venezuela. (Source: AP)More than 100,000 Venezuelans, some of whom drove through the night in caravans, crossed into Colombia over the weekend to hunt for food and medicine that are in short supply at home.It was the second weekend in a row that Venezuelas socialist government opened the long-closed border with Colombia, and by 6 am Sunday, a line of would-be shoppers snaked through the entire town of San Antonio del Tachira. Some had traveled in chartered buses from cities 10 hours away.Venezuelas government closed all crossings a year ago to crack down on smuggling along the 1,378-mile (2,219 kilometer) border. It complained that speculators were causing shortages by buying up subsidized food and gasoline in Venezuela and taking them to Colombia, where they could be sold for far higher prices.Watch Video: Whats making newsBut shortages have continued to mount in Venezuela amid triple-digit inflation, currency controls that have restricted imports and investment and the world oil price slump that caused a collapse in the oil revenues that fund government spending.Although the border was heavily patrolled by Venezuelan troops, the crowds were mostly orderly amid an atmosphere of tense excitement. A few activists handed out anti-government pamphlets, looking to galvanize the frustration that has characterized food riots and long lines outside supermarkets in recent weeks.Some of those waiting to cross made anti-government chants and sang the national anthem, but there was no appetite for confrontation. They were focused on the prospect of getting at fully stocked supermarket shelves and the opportunity to buy even non-essential indulgences like nail polish and beer before the re-closing of border crossings Sunday night.Its kind of crazy day, said Alejandro Chacon, who owns a hardware store in the nearby town of San Cristobal and was crossing the border for the first time since the closure. Its strange to see this, but we know were going to find what we want in Colombia, so its a nice difference.Colombian officials dressed in white shirts individually welcomed those arriving while police handed out cake and blasted out festive vallenato tunes, the traditional music beloved on both sides of the border. Roadside kiosks set up by entrepreneurs took payment in Venezuelas currency for goods at a steep discount from what they cost on the black market back home.Its sad to be doing this, but we also know over there well find something, said Rosa Cardenas, a 70-year-old retired school teacher accompanied by a 5-month-old granddaughter.Colombian officials estimated 35,000 Venezuelans crossed the border Saturday, the first day of what Colombias government called a humanitarian corridor. An additional 88,000 entered Sunday, authorities said as the mad rush on products like sugar and flour led to extra supplies of staple goods being sent from other Colombian cities.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has sought to deflate talk of a humanitarian crisis and instead blames his governments political enemies and self-serving smugglers for shortages. He dismissed as a media show the jarring images a few weeks ago of 500 women pushing through the border checkpoint, saying they were desperate to buy food.On Sunday, Venezuelas state TV ran footage of Venezuelans returning from Colombia empty-handed, dissuaded by what they called price-gouging and the threat of violence by their neighbors.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Of the 11 mills which were put up for sale earlier this year, only one could be sold which has prompted the bank to re-issue tenders.Pramod Karnad, Managing Director of the MSC Bank had stated the decision to sell these mills was taken after they had failed to clear their outstanding debts. The total accumulated debt of these mills was over Rs 360 crore and majority of the mills were closed for the last two crushing seasons. Initially, the bank had floated tenders for seven mills and subsequently four more mills were put up for sale.Other than the Jai ShivShankar Cooperative Mill in Nanded, none of the other mills found response. The lean sugar season, many had pointed out, was one of the reasons for the lukewarm response. The 2017-18 sugar season is expected to be a decent one which might see more private players involved in the field. The mill which was sold in Nanded was also purchased by a private player.Sale of cooperative mills to private players had created a major controversy in the state with many opposing the same. In 2013 the state cabinet had decreed that cooperative mills will not be sold to private mills. However, many had pointed out that it could not be implemented.Cooperative mills, many said, were weak financially and very few will be able to make investments in these mills. In case of a sick or closed unit, the new party has to invest substantially in terms of machinery and modernisation.Meanwhile, Karnad while talking about the payment of pledge loans by mills said the unpaid pledge loan owned by the mills to the bank at present stood at Rs 1,700 crore. At the end of the 2015-16 crushing season the amount was around Rs 2,100 crore, he said. A pledge loan is the money raised by the banks from the MSC Bank by pledging their sugar stock. Once the sugar stock is sold, mills repay the money to the bank. This money is used by mills to pay the farmers. The MSC Bank gives pledge loans to 32 sugar mills in the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sugar has a problem of both tight domestic supplies as well as high international prices.Inflation worries have clearly receded in most food items  barring sugar, potatoes and chana. Even for the last two, the current high prices may be a temporary phenomenon, as the improved soil and sub-soil moisture conditions from a good monsoon is likely to spur plantings in the ensuing rabi season.That leaves only sugar, where there is a problem of both tight domestic supplies as well as high international prices. This is unlike in wheat, for which the governments own precarious stocks position is more than offset by low global prices. At about $205 per tonne, the landed cost of imported wheat in India works out to Rs 1,365 a quintal  below even the minimum support price of Rs 1,525/quintal that was payable to farmers for last years crop.In sugar, on the other hand, the 2016-17 season (October-September) has started with estimated carryover stocks of 75 lakh tonnes (lt). With output projections for the new season ranging from 220 lt to 235 lt, and expected consumption of 260 lt, the closing stocks for September 2017 would be anywhere between 35 lt and 50 lt  not very comfortable.Moreover, white sugar if imported today will cost well above Rs 40 per kg. That is more than the Rs 35-36 per kg that mills are currently realising. A clear picture  of the actual sugarcane available for mills to crush, especially in the wake of successive droughts in Maharashtra and Karnataka  will emerge by January.Either way, sugar is the commodity to watch in the New Year, when we also have the countrys largest cane producer Uttar Pradesh going for Assembly polls.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The main reason offered for postponing crushing operations by a month was to increase sugar recovery by mills.Arun Magdum is a relieved man. The source of it is the Maharashtra government reversing a decision, taken on October 4, not to allow sugar mills in the state to crush any cane for the new 2016-17 season before December 1.Had that been implemented, it would have led to 10-15 per cent weight loss for my sugarcane, says this six-acre farmer from Mangaon, a village in Kolhapur districts Hatkanangale taluka.Mills in Maharashtra normally start crushing from end-October or early-November and wind up operations by late-April/early-May. It enables farmers, then, to plant a quick crop of summer moong (green gram) or groundnut on their vacated fields, before the main kharif season. A one-month delay in crushing rules out cultivation of moong, which, apart from giving me extra income, is also good for replenishing soil nutrients. The governments decision would have dealt a double blow, by reducing the weight of my cane and also preventing me from taking a summer crop, notes Magdum.Watch Video: Whats making newsOn Wednesday, a committee  comprising Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, minister for cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar, the sugar commissioner Vipin Sharma and representatives from the sugar industry  decided to rescind its October 4 decision. The starting date for the season has now been fixed at November 5.The main reason offered for postponing crushing operations by a month was to increase sugar recovery by mills. With severe drought conditions till almost the middle of this year impacting plantings, the state government expects mills to crush only 445 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane in 2016-17, down from 742.94 lt and 930.41 lt in the preceding two seasons. That would translate into a sugar output of just 50.28 lt, the lowest since the 46.14 lt produced in the 2008-09 season.Delayed crushing would have allowed for increased sucrose concentration in the cane, resulting in higher recovery. But now, instead of an average 11.30 per cent sugar recovery, you will have a rate of 11.2-11.25 per cent. Also, the cane that is crushed would be relatively immature with lower yields. It could lead to sugar production dropping below 50 lt, says Jaiprakash Salunkhe Dandegaonkar, vice-president, Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation and chairman of the Purna Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd at Hingoli.That view is also shared by S S Katake, scientist and farm in-charge of the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute. According to him, the cane crop can give 0.2-0.5 percentage points additional sugar recovery, if allowed to remain in the field for an extra month. This year, if crushing were to start by early November, mills will have only around 400 lt of cane to crush. Average recovery, too, hovers between 8-9 per cent during October-November and rising to 10-12 per cent from December. If crushing happens in November, especially this time when there is hardly any cane, you may even end up with sugar production of 40-45 lt, he warns.Low sugar recovery may also hurt farmers, as the fair and average price (FRP) of cane is linked to this rate. The more the sugar recovery, the higher is the FRP payable by mills. Farmers, however, are not buying this argument. For them, the weight loss in cane from a delayed start to crushing and the opportunity foregone in growing a summer moong or groundnut crop far outweigh any gains from higher sugar recovery.Interestingly, the industry itself has been divided on the issue. Mills in the Marathwada region and the adjoining districts of Ahmednagar and Solapur  which include those belonging to both the chairman (Shivajirao Nagavade) and vice-chairman (Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar) of the state cooperative factories federation, and also the cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh  have been in favour of commencing crushing only from December 1.But mills in western Maharashtra  the districts of Pune, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur  have opposed delay in crushing, mainly because of worries over their cane getting poached. Sangli and Kolhapur arent too far away from Karnataka, where mills are expected to begin operations by November 15. There is a shortage of cane in Karnataka. If we do not start in time, the mills there will pay upfront to our farmers, who wouldnt mind diverting their cane, notes Arun Lad, chairman of the Kranti SSK mill in Sangli.Magdum confirms that he was contacted by representatives of Karnataka mills to accept upfront payment against supply of cane. Personally, I wouldnt have wanted to give to these mills, as they pay Rs 200-500 per tonne less than the price I get from the factory here. But if the crushing was to take off only from December 1 (mills starting before that date were liable to pay a hefty fine of Rs 500 for every tonne of cane crushed), I would have been left with no option, he adds.What has tilted the equation, forcing the Fadnavis government to go back on its earlier decision, has been the greater clout wielded by western Maharashtra mills. In normal years, the Marathwada region along with Solapur and Ahmednagar contribute roughly 50 per cent to Maharashtras total sugar output. But this time, 70 per cent of production is likely to come from the four western Maharashtra districts, which were comparatively less impacted by the drought.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The interest on the loan kept mounting with the mills repayment plans taking a hit. On December 17, 2015, the PNB initiated recovery action granting the mill a two-month period to pay off the loan. Following the mills failure in repayment, the bank intimated that it planned to take over the mill property as per its rules. Finally, on September 30, the PNB informed the Ahmednagar district collector that it was in possession of the mills land, Pachputes office, and a bungalow.

A decision in this regard was taken in the Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Union Cabinet has given its approval for extending the validity of the existing Central Order in respect of Sugar for a further period of six months from October 29, 2016 to April 28, 2017, an official statement said.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe main objective of the decision is to enable states to issue control order with the prior concurrence of central government, for fixing stock limits/licensing requirements in respect of sugar, whenever need is felt by them, it said. This is expected to help in the efforts being taken to improve the availability of these commodities to general public at reasonable rates, and control the tendencies of hoarding and profiteering, it noted. The Centre will notify the current decision and will communicate to all the States/UTs.Early this year, the government had reimposed stock limits on sugar traders after a gap of five years due to rise in sugar prices following drop in domestic production. The stock limits on sugar traders were imposed for six months ending October. Traders were allowed to hold sugar stock of up to 10,000 quintals in Kolkata and 5,000 quintals in other parts of the country.As per the stock limit order, a dealer was allowed to stock up to 10,000 quintals of sugar in Kolkata, which is the largest trading centre for the commodity in the country. However, the limit was kept 5,000 quintals for rest of the country. It had also prescribed that a trader has to sell his stock within 30 days from the date of receiving the sugar. Retail sugar prices are ruling around Rs 40 per kg in most places due to likely fall in domestic production due to back-to-back drought.Sugar production of India is likely to decline to 23.2 million tonnes in 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) from 25 million tonnes in the previous year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Hence UP (sugar) mills get better rates (even during heavy selling). However, the neighbouring states of Maharashtra such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are major sugar producers. Thus, the state would not fetch better rates like UP.Besides, he said, the Centre has already withdrawn its export subsidy to mills, which has come as a setback to them. Now, the government is forcing mills to sell their sugar at lower rates compounding their problems.Also, the fresh directive has brought down wholesale sugar prices by Rs 150-200 per quintal.

If sugar mills are allowed to produce ethanol, it will be possible to clear the entire arrear in a single year.Such a step will also help increase the procurement price for canes, he said.

While revoking the distillerys licence Friday, Excise Commissioner V Radha directed her staff to slap a criminal case against Gutte, along with other directors of the distillery.Gutte is known to have enjoyed close ties with former Union minister (late) Gopinath Munde. He had even unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Assembly polls from Parbhanis Gangakhed constituency as the official candidate of the BJP-led alliance. In 2015, Guttes flagship company, Sunil Hitech, had courted controversy over water conservation contracts allotted to it in Parbhani by Maharashtras Water Conservation department, which was led by Mundes daughter Pankaja at that time. Last year, the Income Tax department, too, had raided Sunil Hitechs offices.The fresh trouble with the Excise department comes at a time when Sunil Hitechs stocks have surged. Gutte, when contacted, however, said the controversy wont impact the companys performance in the stock market.The controversyGangakhed Sugar and Energy Private Limited, a group company of Sunil Hitech, runs a molasses-based distillery in Parbhani with a total capacity of almost 60 kilo litres daily. Gutte is the companys chairman, while his wife Sudhamati and son Sunil are co-directors.The Excise department has alleged that the distillery had illegally supplied ethanol or rectified spirit for the manufacture of illicit liquor. In the licence cancellation orders issued Friday, the firm has been accused of unauthorised transportation of intoxicants, unauthorised sale of duty evaded intoxicants, wilful violation of norms, among others.According to information, the trouble for the firm began after September 6 when the departments enforcement division intercepted a tanker (MH04 DS 9808) containing 20,000 litres of duty-evaded rectified spirit from Ahmednagars Pathardi. The tankers driver and cleaner, who were arrested, allegedly told investigators that the consignment, which was allegedly being transported to a notorious alcohol maker operating along the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border, had originated from the distillery. Top sources said about 1 crore litres of alcohol, worth several crores, could be brewed using the supply.Investigators claimed the driver had confessed that the distillerys in-charge, identified as Balasaheb Lohar, had contacted him over the phone that day asking him to collect the consignment. The department, which had earlier filed a case against the driver and the cleaner, has obtained call data records for evidence of the conversation which took place between Lohar and the driver. Investigators said the same records also show that the driver was in the distillerys premises for over an hour that day. They have further obtained CCTV footage from a nearby toll naka, which proves the driver had been to the distillery to collect the consignment.During further investigations, the department came across 1,071.85 tonne of unaccounted for molasses at the distillery. Similarly, 6,232.76 tonne of unaccounted for molasses was found at the sugar factory. Rejecting the firms claim that the molasses found in excess in the distillery and the sugar mill had been gained in surplus during sugar production last year, the departments cancellation order has charged the firm over an intention to divert this for the manufacture of illicit alcohol. On the basis of the orders on Friday, excise officials will now confiscate the distillerys belongings, including the unutilised molasses, revealed top sources.Foul play, says firmGutte, when contacted, indicated plans to go into appeal against the revocation order. According to the department procedure, the firm can file an appeal before Minister of State (Excise) Vijay Deshmukh.Denying any links with either the tanker operator or the alcohol maker, Gutte alleged that he was being targeted unfairly. My distillery already enjoys tax concessions under the mega projects category. Why should I evade the small tax I have to pay then, he said.Interestingly, even as Gutte denied that the intercepted tanker had collected the rectified spirit from his distillery, the firm, in its written reply to the department, has agreed that Lohar was employed with the distillery. It has also agreed that the tanker in question had transported duty paid spirit from the distillery. Gutte further argued that he had approached the department last year to regularise the excess molasses gained, but the department had rejected his application on June 14 this year without citing any grounds. While they (the department) rejected our plea, it did not tell us how to dispose of the surplus molasses, Gutte argued.Radhas cancellation order, however, has rejected this argument. The surplus molasses found is above 5 per cent of the sugar mills production capacity, which cannot be regularised under norms, the order states. It has also rejected the firms contention that the molasses found at the distillery had flowed accidentally from the mill.Second big catchEarlier on October 17, the Excise department had revoked the countryliquor licence of Osmanabad-based Vitthal Distilleries Private Limited, which is run by the family of NCPs sitting MLA Babanrao Shinde, over a two-year-old case related to illegal sale and disposal of 23,227 litres of countryliquor. Vitthal Distilleries has already gone into appeal against the order. Ironically, Vijay Deshmukh, the MoS (Excise), who will hear the matter, represents the same district as Shinde.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

After every rally in Latur, Nanded and Solapur, women from rural and urban Maharashtra expressed anger against the established Maratha leaders who have failed to address their concerns in the field of education and employment. The Marathas constitute 33 per cent of the population and almost two-thirds live in rural Maharashtra. Almost 70 per cent of this population is engaged in agriculture.The middle class and the poor among the community are unanimous in their feeling of being let down by established Maratha leaders who are education barons, own cooperative banks, dairy cooperatives and sugar cooperatives.At the grassroots, the message is loud and clear: there are only a handful of Maratha families that have wielded socio-economic and political control for the last six decades. In spite of massive education network, there is not a single college owned by these education barons where meritorious students from the poor in the community have received financial concessions.A report compiled on the list of established Maratha families says only 159 Maratha families have run the state for the last six decades, said a member of the Kranti Maratha Morcha.Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh chief Prakash Ambedkar said the rallies were a battle between the rich and established Marathas versus the poor Marathas.Speaking to The Indian Express, Chhaya said, When it comes to seeking our votes, they display the caste card. But when it comes to helping our children on merit, they show no charity. Time has come to re-look and also stand with only those who will secure our childrens future.Even as the community cutting across sub-castes and class has united to demand reservation in education and employment, the undercurrents indicated the Maratha youth are looking for an alternative leadership.As Kashmira Tatke, a college student, put it, If you notice our rallies, there is not a single established Maratha leader on the stage. Whether it is women or youth, we have only one issue  reservation for Marathas.Tatke is part of the core committee that is organising the rallies under the banner of Kranti Maratha Morcha.However, senior leaders from the Congress-NCP have described the rallies as an outcome of anger against the BJP government. Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, The cooperative movement has played a significant role in addressing the concerns of the farmers and rural people. Stating that there are several examples of charitable work own district, he said, We have great bond between farmers and our constituents.A senior NCP leader from Western Maharashtra, who did not wish to be named, said, We can understand the poor Marathas anger. The agriculture crisis due to drought and growing aspirations are making life difficult. But the cooperative sectors role in addressing community welfare cannot be undermined. There are thousands of registered cooperative societies accommodating lakh of members from our community in various institutions across sugar mills, district co-op banks, cooperative dairy, private colleges, schools, hospitals etc.Another Congress leader said, The problem is established leaders had started treating the cooperative sector as private limited company instead of public trust in last three decades. As a result, the generation next Marathas have started raising questions today. He added, The reforms in Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank exposed massive corruption. The misuse of funds by several leaders of our own Congress-NCP had pushed the bank to debt. But it turned into profit when we appointed new administrator. So, our communitys concern about farmers with small land holding not getting loans from district cooperative bank or not getting admission in private colleges owned by our colleagues need a re-look.A Kranti Maratha Morcha volunteer said the mammoth public support to the rallies was an alarm bell for the established Maratha leaders in Congress-NCP who dominated the community vote bank. He said, At this moment, these rallies are leaderless. There is, however, fierce competition within as most prominent leaders in their respective districts are trying to take the credit. To some extent, their involvement in financial and logistical support is working to mobilise the masses.The consolidation of Maratha community is being exploited by NCP to reconnect to the masses to reaffirm its identity in the state. Similar is the approach of Congress leaders, said another volunteer who did not with to be named.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Both presaged their mature exploits with precocious Olympics appearances, Phelps as a 15-year-old contesting the 200m butterfly in 2000, and Bolt, at 17, finishing fifth in his heat in the 200m in 2004.Twin titans Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps have mined a trove of Olympic gold, changed the sporting landscape and left a huge hole that starts in Rio and goes around the world.International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach hailed the two superstars as icons. But he will leave the 31st Olympic Games wondering how to fill their places.There is noone in sight with the sporting power nor the charisma to take the place of Phelps and Bolt  who have 32 gold medals between them  in the swimming pool or on the running track.The Greatest maybe just Muhammad Ali-style hyperbole that Bolt likes to throw about but his nine golds over three Olympics cannot be countered.Phelps won five golds in Rio at the age of 31 having retired once and come back  and crashed a car under the influence along the way.We have seen athletes who were icons even before they arrived here, they have strengthened their position as icons, like Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt, Bach said Saturday.From Beijing in 2008 through London 2012 and, finally, in Rio, Bolt and Phelps captivated die-hard fans of their sports and casual spectators attracted like moths to the Olympic flame.Perfect pairBoth presaged their mature exploits with precocious Olympics appearances, Phelps as a 15-year-old contesting the 200m butterfly in 2000, and Bolt, at 17, finishing fifth in his heat in the 200m in 2004.By those Games in Athens in 2004, Phelps was already challenging Mark Spitzs record of seven titles at one Games, coming away with six golds and two bronze.In Beijing he cemented his place among Games greats with a perfect eight golds in eight events at the Water Cube while Bolt electrified the Birds Nest stadium with his 100m, 200m and 4x100m sprint triumphs.From Beijing on they were linked in Games lore, each adding to his legacy in 2012  Bolt with another sprint sweep and Phelps with four more gold to add to his staggering tally of Olympic medals.Although a burned-out Phelps flirted with retirement after London, it was fitting that his decision to return for one last, fifth, campaign, saw him bow out at the same time as Bolt. The Jamaicans unprecedented third sweep of the 100m, 200m and 4x100m means debate will rage loud and long as to which can claim the status of greatest Olympian.Phelps leads the medals table by a mile. His five golds in Rio took his already stunning tally to 23 gold among a total of 28.Bolt, meanwhile, has dominated in the tests of speed that are the quintessential sporting contests, maintaining his supremacy over an unprecedented span of years.Ive proven to the world Im the greatest, declared the ebulliant Jamaican, who preens and poses with the same unabashed ardor with which he runs.Its a massive gap, but its not a gap that is insuperable, International Association of Athletics Federations president Sebastian Coe said of Bolts departure.He compared it to questions asked with Alis withdrawal in the 1970s. Well, Floyd Mayweather, Marvin Hagler, Manny Pacquiao and Sugar Ray Leonard come along.Bolts bouncy showmanship  complete with sly grins for out-classed rivals as he passes them with the finish line in sight  is the opposite of Phelpss steely competitive demeanour.But the American revelled in his Rio triumphs, and showed a softer side with infant son Boomer included in his victory celebrations.As a kid I set out to do someting that nobody had ever done before, Phelps said. I can look back at my career and say: I did it.'Bolt, now headed into a year-long victory lap that will culminate with the World Championships in London, can say the same.Ill have to make a new bucket list now, Bolt said.

(Source: File) Elections to over two lakh cooperative institutions in the state were necessitated after the Bombay High Courts order to conduct them. (Source: File)The second phase of elections for the cooperative bodies in the state might see officers using electronic voting machines (EVM) instead of the traditional ballot paper. Officers of the State Cooperation Election Commission said they would seek funds from the state government to procure special EVMs to conduct the polls.Elections to over two lakh cooperative institutions in the state were necessitated after the Bombay High Courts order to conduct them. Former cooperation commissioner Madhukar Choudhari was appointed as the election commissioner of the elections. The first phase of the elections saw 62,000 cooperative institutions like sugar mills, district central cooperative banks, urban cooperative banks, cooperative credit societies along with cooperative housing societies going for polls.Senior officials of the commission said that EVMs, which have to be used for the cooperative bodys elections, are different from the ones used by the Election Commission. These EVMs are multipost machines which should allow for multiple voting options. Most cooperative bodies see voters electing panels. We have tried out using EVMs in three elections and the results are encouraging. It will allow us to conduct the whole process of election in a relatively lesser time, said officials. The commission has raised a budgetary head of Rs 2.5 crore for procuring EVMs in the first phase. Incidentally, the second phase of elections for at least 7,000 cooperative societies is to start soon.Meanwhile, the first phase of the elections threw up several interesting trends about cooperative societies in general. At least 70 per cent of the elections were done unopposed with the existing body getting a repeat chance. Closely contested elections were seen for sugar mills, district central cooperative banks and state level federations. Elections for housing societies, urban credit societies, and urban banks were unopposed mostly. At least 50 per cent of the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) saw elections in the rural parts.Cooperative societies, especially the sugar mills or the banks, have traditionally been seats of power for the state.Of immense importance in the rural economy, these bodies have been controlled by the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for years together. While the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena had tried to gain a foothold in the sector, their presence has been minimal mostly.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Our freedom reminds us of the sacrifice of our freedom fighters and their devotion to the cause of freedom through struggle and sacrifice. On this occasion, we remember those young people who went willingly to gallows. We are breathing today in free India, thanks to Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Pandit Nehru and many other great leaders and people who struggled and worked consistently towards freedom of the country.India is an ancient nation. We have a history and cultural heritage of thousands of years. From Vedas to Vivekananda, from Upnishads to satellites, from Lord Krishna to Mahatma Gandhi, and from Bhima of Mahabharata to Bhim Rao; we have had a long historic journey and heritage. This land has seen many ups and downs, and struggle through several generations. Many of them dedicated themselves to make a better human life.India is not 70 years old, but it is a journey of 70 years post-colonial rule. After Independence, we made efforts to take the country forward under a new system. Sardar Vallbhai Patel unified the country and now it is our duty to make this country as the best nation. We have to make continuous efforts to realise our dream to make India Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.My fellow brothers and sisters, freedom has not come without a price. There were endless atrocities but the resolve was unwavering. Every Indian was a soldier of the freedom movement. Everyone wanted freedom of the country. It is possible that someone might not have been imprisoned, someone might not have been able to make sacrifice but even then, every Indian had a resolve for freedom. Mahatma Gandhi was the leader.It was the motivation of the sacrifice of armed revolutionaries which led to Swaraj. But now, to change the self governance into good governance is the resolve of 125 crore citizens. If the Swaraj was achieved through sacrifice, attainment of Suraj (good governance ) is also not possible without sacrifice, valor, dedication and discipline. So to further the Good-Governance resolve of 125 crore people, all have to move ahead with their respective responsibilities and dedication.In order to attain Good Governance, everyone has to fulfill its responsibilities, be it a Panchayat or Parliament, be it a Gram Pradhan or a Prime Minister, to strengthen every democratic institution. Only then, India will not take too much time in realizing the dream of Good-Governance.It is true that our country is confronted with a number of problems but we must not forget that if there are problems, the country also has capabilities and when we move ahead with such capabilities, the paths of solutions also become available. So, my brothers and sisters, if India have millions of problems, we have 125 crore brains also which are capable of solving the problems.Brothers and sisters, there was a time when Governments in our country were mired in allegations, but time has changed now. Today, the Government is not surrounded by charges and allegations, but by expectations. And when there are expectations around, it is an indication that when there is hope, when there is trust, then only expectations arise from their womb, and expectations speed up the journey towards good governance, and fulfill expectations on a continuous basis. So my brothers and sisters, for us this journey of Surajya  today when I am speaking to you from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is but natural that there will be discussion as to what the Government is doing and what is happening in the country, what should be done for the country. I can also present a detailed account of what the Governments has done and can underline many things.A large number of initiatives have been taken in two years tenure, numerous actions taken, but if I start elaborating, then maybe I will have to speak from the rampart of Red Fort for one week. So instead of that, today I want to draw your attention towards the work culture of this Government, not the work only. Sometimes it is easy to account for the work but it is not easy for a layman to know, grasp, understand and identify the work culture until you go into depth.So my brothers and sisters, today I am not talking only of the policy but also of the intent and the decisions. Brothers and sisters, it is not an issue of direction only but a matter of wider attitude.This is not only an outline. It is a commitment for transformation. This is confluence of peoples expectations, democracy and peoples support. This is a desire and also consent, this is a momentum and also expression of progress.Therefore my beloved countrymen, today when I speak of good governance, my straight forward meaning is  to make a difference in the life of the common man. Good governance means that administration should be sensitive, should be responsible and should be dedicated to the common man. And then we need to emphasize on good governance, keep on exploring the responsibility of everyone, responsibility and accountability should be at the root of good governance and it should get sustenance from there. Therefore, administration should be sensitive.Just remember the times, when if we had to go to any big hospital, we had to wait for many days. When people used to come to AIIMS, they had to wait for two to three days to just know when they will have to undergo the tests. Today we have been able to change the entire system. There is an online registration, online appointment of doctors, and when the patient comes at the time given to him, his treatment starts. Not only this, his medical records are available online. And in the area of health, we want to develop this culture throughout the country. Today, the government has brought this system in more than 40 big hospitals but the bottom line is that administration should be sensitive. Brothers and sisters, the administration should be accountable. If the administration is not accountable, the problems of the common man remain unattended. How does change happen- we have technology but there was a time when rail tickets .common man of India is linked to rail tickets, the poor man is linked to it. Earlier, through technology, only 2000 tickets were issued in one minute. There was a time  people waited for the website to open. Today I can say with satisfaction that in one minute, 15,000 rail tickets can be issued.The government should be accountable as to how a responsible Government should take steps on the basis of the needs and aspirations of the common man.There is a class in the country, especially the middle class, the upper middle class, who is more troubled with income- tax officials than the police. I have to change this situation, I am trying and I will change it. But there was a time when an honest Taxpayer would pay his income-tax, even pay extra two rupees so that he does not face any problem. But, once the tax was deposited, he would face difficulties in getting refund. He even had to go to the extent of canvassing and wait endlessly for the refund. Now, we have introduced a system of online refund. Now refund is done within a time frame of 1 to 3 weeks. Those who are watching this telecast on television will also agree that their refund reached them directly, without any application for it. This became possible only due to efforts in making government accountable.You know, for good governance, transparency is important. Our society is now gradually becoming connected with the world. Earlier, only 40-50 lakhs people used to apply for passport in a year. Now a days, 2 crore people apply for it. Earlier 4 to 6 months were wasted only in inquiries if someone had no recommendation. But now the situation has changed. I can say with pride that now citizens can get a passport in 1 to 2 weeks, without any recommendation/canvassing. It is due to transparency in governance. No delay, no need of recommendation. Today I can say that, in a short time during 2015-16 itself, we have issued 1.75 crore passports to our citizens.Efficiency is the hallmark of Good governance. Earlier if anyone wanted to start a company or business, they had to even struggle for its registration for a minimum of at least 6 months. But this situation has now changed. Due to efficiency in governance now, the same employees under the same rule complete the process of company registration within 24 hours. In last July itself, 900 of such registrations materialised.My fellow brothers and sisters, for good rule, good governance is necessary. We have taken many steps for good governance. Last year, I announced that there will be no interview for group C and group D posts. They will get jobs on the basis of merit. We have identified almost 9000 such posts. Now these 9000 posts will not be put for the process of interview. Our young aspirants will not have to spend any money for appearing for interviews nor they will have to search for someone for canvassing or recommendation. Doors for corruptions and middle men have been shut and this system is now in place.My fellow brothers and sisters, there was a time when government used to announce the scheme and spell out what will be done under the said scheme. It was the practice to keep the people satisfied. People used to hope that something will happen now. Then they started inquiring about plans. Subsequently, the people demanded to know about budget. Over the past 70 years, the mindset of country has changed. People are not satisfied with the launch of schemes, the plan details, and the budget provisions. The common man is satisfied only when something appears on the ground. We cant make things work on ground at a slow pace. We will have to accelerate our speed, move at faster pace.Rural Roads in our country- Every person in a village expects permanent concrete road. A very big task- Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji started it with special attention. And the later Governments continued it, promoted it. We have tried to give it speed. Earlier it was 70-75 Kilometers per day of Rural Road construction. Today we have increased it to 100 Km a day. This speed will meet the expectations of common man in the coming days.We are laying emphasis on power in our country, and in particular on the Renewable Energy. There was a time  after many years of Independence, work on Wind Energy started. In the last one year, we have increased it nearly by 40 percent. This is the meaning of speed. Solar Energy now the entire world is paying attention to it. We have increased it by 116 percent. This is not an incremental change, it is a very big high jump. We want to increase things as per its quantum. If there is production of energy in our country, we need transmission lines and a proper system of transmission lines. Two years before the formation of our government, 30-35 thousand kms of transmission lines were being laid every year. With satisfaction, I can say that today, we have made it up to 50,000 Kilometers. This is a task of speeding up. If we talk about Rail line commissioning, and commissioning means track ready to run trains, completion of all trials. In the previous 10 years, it was 1500 kms, and today we are able to make it up to 3500 kms in two years. We are furthering this speed.My Brothers and sisters, today we are stressing on direct benefit by linking the Aadhar Card with the government schemes, thereby stopping the leakages. In the earlier regime, nearly 4 crore people could be added to government schemes with Aadhar Card. Today, I can say with great satisfaction that compared to the number of 4 crore, we have completed the task of linking 70 crore citizens with the Aadhar and Government schemes. Whatever is left, is also being completed.In our country, a middle class man or woman takes prestige in having a car in their home. There was a time that a gas stove in a house was taken as a standard and a status in the society. During a span of 60 years after independence, LPG could be provided to about 14 crore people. I am satisfied that on one side there were 14 crore LPG connection in 60 years and on the other we have given 4 crore new connections in just 60 weeks. Where does 14 crore in 60 years stand against 4 crore in 60 weeks. This is a speed with which the change in the quality of life of the common man has been brought about.We have started the cleaning the web of laws. Burden of multiplicity of laws is creating trouble for the government, judiciary and the citizens. We have identified 1700 such laws. The Parliament has already abolished about 1175 laws and we want to abolish the remaining such laws.It had become the nature in the country to believe that somethings can be done, but other things cannot be done. It cannot be done now, and nobody is sure whether it can be done in the future. Pessimism had started to become our nature. It was important to break this tendency, give energy to administration. And when we see some success we get encouraged, our energy increases, our resolve get sharpened and the results start looking closer.When we started Prime Ministers Jan Dhan Yojana, it seemed to be an almost impossible task. For so many years, there were banks, there was Government, bank nationalization had already happened, but the common man was not part of countrys economic mainstream. By linking 21 crore families, 21 crore citizens with Jan Dhan Yojana, a seemingly impossible task has been done. This is not a matter of credit for the government- it has been done by 125 crore of countrymen and therefore I salute my countrymen.Honouring the women in the villages of India is another aspect of this initiative. Open defecation should be stopped  there should be toilets in villages. When I had the privilege to meet you from the ramparts of Red Fort the first time, I had expressed my feelings about how this can happen in our country. Today I can tell you that within this short period, more than 2 crore toilets have been built. More than 70 thousand villages have been freed from open defecation. We are working to make changes in the normal life of the people.Last year from the ramparts of Red Fort, I had said that within next thousand days, we will bring electricity to those 18,000 villages where even after 70 years of independence there was no electricity. They were compelled to live in the 18th century. We resolved to convert the impossible to possible. With great happiness, I can say that not even the half of the 1000 days have past, we are far away from the half way mark, and yet 10,000 villages out of 18,000 have received electricity. And I have been told that out of these, there are many villages where people will be sitting before the TV for the first time today to see the festival of independence of India. I send my special greetings to those villages from here.Brothers and sisters, you will be surprised, that at a distance of 3 hours travel from Delhi there is a village in Hathras called Nagla-Fatela. It takes 3 hours to reach Nangla-Fatela. But it took 70 years for electricity to reach there.And therefore, I am bringing to your notice the work being done by us, the work culture being adopted by us. My fellow brothers and sisters, those working on the LED technology research invented a bulb for the benefit of common man. LED bulb was expensive and used to sell at rupees 350 per bulb. Who would buy these costly bulbs? Government thought over it. If LED bulb can change lives in India, change environment in India, improve the economy, then it was necessary to make some efforts towards this direction. In government system of functioning, there are things when government should not interfere, but it does. And where intervention is required, it doesnt. We are trying to change this work culture and due to the Government intervention, the LED bulb, which was selling for Rupees 350, is now being distributed for Rupees 50. You can see the difference now. I want to ask where this all money was going. We have so far distributed 13 crore LED bulbs. Our politics has become populist and populism has become hallmark of economic policies. If we had given rupees 300 per bulb to people, I would have earned praise that he is a good Prime Minister who has filled peoples pocket with Rupees 300.Buy by distributing LED bulb at Rupees 50, we have helped people save thousands in the long run. 13 crore LED bulbs have so far been distributed. We have resolved to distribute 77 crore bulbs. And today I want to appeal to fellow countrymen please use LED bulb. You will save money annually and Save energy and save climate of the country. When we have 77 crore LED bulbs, India will save electricity worth 20000 MW. When we save 20000 MW electricity, the country will save 1.25 lakh crore rupees. My fellow brothers and sisters, if you use one LED bulb in your home, country can save 1.25 lakh crore rupees. By saving 20000 MW electricity, we can fight against global warming. We can contribute immensely to save our environment with the help of common man and that is why we have taken steps in that direction.You know how to convert impossible into the possible. For energy and petroleum products, we are dependent on other nations. For a long time, we signed agreements so that we get things at fixed price for a longer duration. We have gas agreement with Qatar till 2024. However the gas price was such that it is proving costly for the Indian economy. Our good relations with Qatar made renegotiations possible on the said agreement. Today I can say with satisfaction that renegotiations made the impossible become possible and we could save 20000 crore rupees for the exchequer of India. Qatar was entitled to get this 20000 crore rupees but due to our good relations and character of foreign policy, we could achieve this.Chabahar port is an essential link between India and Central Asia. Previous governments continuously talked and made efforts to implement this project. Today, this impossible task has been made possible, to my satisfaction. Iran, Afghanistan and India are jointly working to construct the Chabahar port to make this impossible task possible.My fellow brothers and sisters, one thing that I would like to say now is connected with common man- it is price rise. It is true that during the rule of previous government, the Inflation rate crossed 10 percent mark. With our continued efforts, we have not allowed Inflation Rate to go beyond 6 percent. Not only it, currently we have come with an agreement with the Reserve Bank that it should take steps to control the inflation to 4 percent plus-minus 2 percent. Amidst the talks of the balance between Inflation and Growth, the Reserve Bank should also work further for moving ahead. There were two years drought in the country. The price of vegetables are affected instantly by the drought, shortage has its effect. Due to it, there were some problems. The two years drought also became a cause of concern due to decline in the pulses production. But brothers and sisters, had the price rise increased in the same way as it was heading earlier, I dont know what could have happened to the poor man of my country. We have tried our best to contain it. Still this government is followed with expectations My countrymans expectations are natural and I will leave no stone unturned in trying to achieve the goal. I will do my best efforts and will not let the food plate of poor person get costlier.My dear brothers and sisters, the country is preparing for the 350th Anniversary of Guru Govind Singh Ji. How this country can forget the Saga of sacrifice, a tradition of Sikh Gurus and that too when it is celebrating the 350th Anniversary of Guru Govind Singh Ji. Guru Govind Singh Ji said one thing very aptly. He used to say how can I consider a hand sacred if that has not served ever, not ever done any work , the hand which has not become strong by toiling hard and there are no knots upon it. This was the saying of Guru Govind Singh Ji. Today, when we are celebrating the 350th Anniversary of Guru Govind Singh Ji, then I remember my farmer, who is the person who has more pious hands than of a farmer. Who could have a more pious heart than that of a farmer? Without it, what purpose can be more sacred than it. I salute my farmer brothers who have despite two years of drought made relentless efforts to fill the grain stores of this country.Drought situation has changed. This time, there is a good rainfall at many places. There were troubles also at some places due to excessive rain. Government of India is with those states and citizens who are in trouble. But I want to especially facilitate our farmers for increasing the sowing of pulses by one and half times at a time when the country is facing problem due to availability of pulses. The farmers had earlier shifted to other crops at a time when the demand for pulses from the common man had increased. We have fixed the MSP for pulses. We have announced bonus for pulses. We have put in place a better system for procurement of pulses. And therefore, we are encouraging farmers to grow pulses for getting big profit.When I had spoken about work culture, it is clear that we do not see things in compartments. We see things in a unified, integrated manner. Take the example of agriculture, where we have developed a work culture in a way that the entire chain can give big results.Initially we paid attention to the health of mother earth, health of the soil. We brought Soil Health Card, macro-nutrition, micro- nutrition and explained to the farmers the shortcomings and strengths of their farm lands and told them which crops can and which cannot be sown in their fields. Slowly the farmers started to plan according to the soil health cards and many told me that their expenses have come down by almost 25% and the production has increased by 30%. This is a small amount but with the spread of this information, things will move ahead. The farmers have land, if they get water they can create miracles. This is the strength the farmers of this country have and therefore we have stressed on water management, irrigation and water conservation. How to use each and every drop of water, how to increase utilization of water, per drop-more crop, Micro-irrigation- we are emphasizing on it. More than 90 irrigation schemes were lying incomplete. We have resolved to first complete these projects and lakhs of people will benefit. To reduce the input cost of the farmers, we have taken a big step towards solar pumps. Farmers need electricity, for water also they need electricity and electricity is costly. Because of solar pumps, input cost of farmers will be reduced, recurring expenses will reduce. He will now own not only his farmland but also have free electricity through solar power. My farmer will be self reliant and happy. So far, we have been successful in distributing 77 thousand solar pumps.I want to congratulate my scientists also. Along with farmland, water and solar pumps, we need good seeds also. Our scientists have developed more than 131 new variety of seeds suitable to Indias environment. These will increase per hectare yield. The quality is also increasing. I congratulate these scientists.Farmers need Urea, fertilizers. There was a time when there was black marketing of fertilizers. One had to face police lathicharge to get fertilizers. There was a time when people had to see their harvest getting ruined due to lack of fertilizers. Now, shortage of fertilizers has become an issue of past. We have succeeded in increasing the production of fertilizers. Because of this production, the possibility of farmers getting fertilizers in time has increased.Similarly, we have announced the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana  to protect the land owned by the farmer upto the produce of the farm. My fellow brothers and sisters, we have provided the maximum guarantee to the farmers at the lowest premium. We have built additional godowns to protect the 15 lakh tonnes produce.Our farmers would be benefited when we do value addition and in this direction, the government is stressing on food processing and 100 per cent foreign direct investment is being encouraged. This will benefit the agro- based industry and help fulfil my dream of doubling the farmers income by 2022.My fellow brothers and sisters, it has become a tradition in our country that successive governments have taken recourse to populist announcements and measures, emptied the state coffers to polish their image. I have tried to do away with this practise and emphasized on total transformation, transformation with transparency. Reform, perform, transform is the mantra which has been applied in all fields of work and range.My fellow brothers and sisters, my government is only emphasizing the need to build an image of the country and not of any party. Only when the countrys image is carved out, it will benefit the future generations. This is why, we have stressed on creating an image of the country and not that of the government.You would have also noticed the wide ranging work done by us in all fields. In the railways, at one level, we are talking about installing the Bio-toilets in trains and on the other hand, we also dream of running the Bullet train in the country. At one level, we are talking about the soil health card and on the other hand, we are taking strides in satellite and space technology. We not only talk about Stand-Up India but also taking steps to implement Start-Up India. We stress upon substance over symbolism. We stress upon integrated development rather than the isolated development. We stress empowerment and not entitlement.My fellow brothers and sisters, the government is identified by the new policies announced towards this end. The government ensures continuity and if the earlier government has announced a scheme which has drawbacks, then the new government should rectify the same and take it further without being egoist as arrogance has no place in democracy. In this context, our government in all humility, has given importance to the schemes and policies of the previous governments and carried them forward as part of our work culture to develop the country and improve economy towards all round development. I personally monitor the programmes through Pragati and review them. You would be surprised to know that 118 projects announced by governments costing over 7.5 lakhs crore rupees are pending at various stages of implementation. I have revived such projects and directed that they should be completed and now the government is doing so.We made a project monitoring group to which I specifically instructed to find out what were the projects that were started in the past- Some 20 years ago, some 25 years ago, some 30 years ago, 15 years ago, those which were stranded. People who are living in those areas are aware of it. We identified such 270 projects, estimated at nearly 10 Lakh crore rupees for which foundation stones were laid by any government, 1000-2000 crore rupees may have been invested in some of them but it was going waste. My brothers and sisters, hindering of plans, delays in projects and wastage of money is a criminal negligence. We have again tried to make these projects workable and viable. Brothers and sisters, clearance to Railway projects used to take 2 years. Any rail line is going and we have to make overhead bridge, there were good roads constructed on both sides but the clearance was taking more than two years. Brothers and sisters, today we are doing that in three-four months, maximum six months to give the project clearance, that speed we have attained.Brothers and sisters, whatever work we do, whatever we may plan, but we have to think on one aspect that the government is for good governance, for the delivery to the last man, how a person standing at the end of line is getting benefitted. Brothers and sisters, it is only when there is clear policy, clear intent, clean intent, then only you get the spirit for taking the decision and only then there could be decisions without any restrictions.Only due to clear policies and clear intent and clear decisions, our government is moving ahead and stressing upon delivery to the last man.We have seen, if you go through Uttar Pradesh Newspapers every year, sugarcane farmers due was a topic of discussion every time. The sugar mills do not do this, the state government does not do this, it is the farmers problem. The due was of thousands of crores, thousands of crores. We made plan for it, followed it. The target was that money should reach the last man delivery farmer. Whatever was the old due of thousands of crores, my brothers and sisters, I say with satisfaction that 99.5% old dues have been cleared. It has happened after many years for the first time. This time whatever amount of sugarcane came in the market and purchased, I can say with satisfaction that so far, 95% of the farmers have been paid for their crop and the rest 5% if remaining will be paid in the days to come.Brothers and sisters, we have taken the task of providing LPG connections to poor families. Under the Ujjawala Scheme, we have vigorously launched a campaign of making my mothers free from the smoke of kitchen. Five crore poor family will get gas stoves in three years and work is going on this project. We have reached the figure of nearly 50 Lakh families and that too in just 100 days. You can assume, that it may be possible that we could complete this work well before three years. We want to stress upon the last man delivery.Due to information technology, whatsapp, messages, online, e-mail, our post-offices were becoming irrelevant slowly. Post Office is an example of our identity. We have revived and rejuvenated our post offices. It is now linked with poor and small persons. If any government representative gets the affection of a common man in India, it is the postman. Everyone loves postman and postman also loves everybody, but we never paid attention towards them. We have taken a step to convert our post offices into payment banks. Starting of this payment bank will spread the chain of banks in the villages across the country in one go. The benefit of JAN-DHAN Account will also be available and now the MNREGA money through Aadhar Card is also getting transferred in the account of a common man leading to reduction in corruption.Brothers and Sisters, in our country, the PSUs are formed to fall in a pit, to fail, to get locked or to be sold out. That has been the history. We have tried to bring in a new culture. And today for the first time, I can say with satisfaction that Air India which had a bad image, has succeeded in registering an operational profit last year. At a time when telecom companies all over the world were earning, BSNL was falling in a pit. For the first time, BSNL has succeeded in earning operational profit. Nobody knew whether Shipping Corporation of India would ever be in profit. Today Shipping Corporation of India is making profit. There was a time when nobody knew that a powerhouse will be operational next week or not, coal will reach there or not. A number of powerhouses were being shut down due to shortage of coal used to be the news. Today, coal is available at the door step of powerhouses. They have stock available for as many months as required. Brothers and sisters, we have done this. You have seen this.At times, there are discussions about big corruption in our country. I have seen the common man at the lowest level suffers most due to corruption and it leads to wastage of money. We have linked Aadhaar Card and Aadhaar number with Government schemes. Brothers and Sisters, there was a time when we saw whether it was the widow pension, scholarship, schemes for divyangs, or for minorities, money used to go from Government coffers and beneficiaries list also used to come. But when we enquired in depth, we found there were persons in the list which were not even born. They were getting benefits of the schemes. Middle men used to siphon out millions of rupees and nobody could notice that. We drove out such middle men from the system. We transferred the money directly to the beneficiaries. We noticed that there were millions of people who never got the money. Millions of rupees used to be transferred. Now it has stopped, money has been saved, but we have said that those needy who have been left out, should be identified and the saved money should go to their accounts, to those who want to fight for their rights. We have worked in the direction of last man delivery, and we have achieved this.Everyone knows of the power of transparency, and corruption in coal sector. There are no allegations today in the auction of coal. In the days to come, as more coal will be mined by the States, more income will come.There was a time when there were allegations regarding auction of spectrum. We auctioned online and today the coffers of our country are getting filled. It led to a healthy competition and country benefitted from this.Brothers and Sisters, today the world is moving in an era of global economy. Ever nation is inter-connected and inter-dependent. The entire world is connected through economic issues in some way or the other. However, much we progress, we have to keep in mind the global economy, and global arena and we have to successfully meet the global standards and match them. Then we will be relevant, then we will be able to contribute and a time will come when we will be able to lead the global economy. Therefore, we will have to be ready at all times and align ourselves with global standards. You would have seen that in recent time, World Bank, IMF, World Economic Forum, Credit Rating Agencies and all such agencies of the world have praised Indias progress. Successive decisions of India in the field of legal reforms, systematic reforms and change in approach- are being watched by the world. In ease of doing business, we have improved our ranking very fast. India has become the most favoured nation for Foreign Direct Investment. In Growth rate and GDP, we have left behind the big economies of the world.My fellow brothers and sisters, a United Nations organization has just given a forecast about Indias future in next 2 years. According to its assessment, India, which is currently 10th in global economy will reach the 3rd position within next 2 years. My fellow brothers and sisters, global standards take into account logistical support and infrastructure while rating a country. They also compare countrys performance with developed and prosperous countries. The World Economic Forum has analyzed logistical support and infrastructure in context of India and said that India is progressing rapidly and moved up 19 steps in the rating index.My fellow brothers and sisters, in global context, Indian economy is dynamic and moving forward on predictable lines. Approval of GST law by parliament has further strengthened our economy and all political parties are worthy of praise for making it possible.My fellow brothers and sisters, from the ramparts of the Red Fort only, I talked about Beti Bachao Beti Padhao. We dont work in piecemeal basis. We have an integrated approach towards implementation of our policies. I need co-operation from society to make Beti Bachao Beti Padhao a success. Each and every parent must remain alert on this front we must respect our daughters, provide them security and ensure that they get benefits of government policies. We have brought together crores of families with Sukanaya Samridhi Yojna. The scheme takes care of our daughters when they achieve adulthood. We have ensured that our insurance policies give maximum benefit to women. The Indradhanush vaccination program empowers our mothers and sisters, both on economic and health fronts. If we empower women on these two fronts and also educate them, then it will be real empowerment of women. If woman is educated, healthy and economically independent then she shall be capable of fighting poverty. That is why we are working towards women empowerment on health and economic prosperity. We have introduced Mudra Yojana and I am happy to know that more than 3.5 crore families have taken benefit of this scheme. Most of the people were the first timers to reach the doors of the bank and out of them 80% belong to SC/ST and OBC. Under Mudra Yojana, 80% loans were taken by women and how these women will contribute in economic development, this would be worth paying attention.Brothers and sisters, last week we decided that our mothers and sisters who are now partners in the development journey, need leave after delivery. Earlier, they were getting maternity leave for lesser number of days. Now, we have enhanced it it to 26 weeks so that a mother could take better care of her child.The weavers, persons working in textiles who make thread and bunch of threads, were earlier getting 100 rupees. We have enhanced this amount to 190 rupees so that, my mothers-sisters who are weaving thread, will be empowered. Those mothers and sisters and weavers who are doing silk work, for them we have increased the price of their produce by 50 rupees/meter and have decided that this amount will not go to the businessman or the broker. Instead this will go in the account of that weaver who has worked upon that silk, the fifty rupee per meter will be credited in her account through Aadhar, making my weaver empowered. We have started this scheme in that direction and its impact is visible.My dear countrymen, when we see train, post office, we also see the unity of India there. More and more efforts we make to unite India and bring change in our system, it strengthens the unity and integrity of our country. For this, we have launched a scheme Mandi e-NAM for the farmers. Today, a farmer can sell his produce in any of the market online across the country. Today, he is not compelled to sell his produce in a market 10 kms away from his fields, at cheaper rates without any income for his hard labour. Now, in the country, through e-NAM, a Network of its own kind, Mandi Network is getting established.Taxation through GST is also bound to bring equality and a common system that will also unite the country.You will be surprised that earlier there was plenty of electricity without any taker and scarcity of electricity was forcing people to live in dark, factories were closing. To bring in the change in electricity supply, we have started One Nation- One Grid- One Price system with success and that too in a very short time. Earlier, one had to pay ten rupees per unit electricity in summer season. Now, when I visited Telangana, the price of electricity on that day was one rupee ten paise/unit which used to be ten rupee. This one price results in joining the country.The worker in our country works at a place and changes his job after one-two years. His money is deducted in EPF but it was non-transferrable. You will be surprised that when I took charge of this government, 27 thousands crore rupees of my workers was stacked in the EPF, without any taker because there was no system for it.We gave a Universal Account Number to our workers for solving this problem. Now, wherever he goes, his EPF fund will also be transferred. Whenever, a labourer retires, he will get his money and it will not remain stacked in any government coffer. We have done this.Be it Bharatmala or Setu Bharatam or Bharat Net, we have strengthened such initiatives. The initiatives should be in the direction of uniting India, economic development of India and we are working in this direction.Brothers and sisters, this year is important in many ways. The country is celebrating the 1000th Anniversary of Shriman Ramanujacharya Ji, the saint from South India, the country is celebrating the 150th Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhis Guru Shrimad Rajchandra Ji and the country is also celebrating the 350th Anniversary of Sh. Guru Govind Singh Ji. The nation is observing the centenary year of Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay. Today, when I am remembering Ramanujacharya Ji then I want to say one thing. Thousands of years ago, and now today, when we see social tension then Ramanujacharya ji, the saint, what message he gave to the country. Ramanujacharya Ji, used to say that all the devotees of God, should serve without having a thought of discrimination and feeling of low and high. Respect everybody and dont humiliate anyone due to age or caste. What Gandhiji said, what Ambedkarji said what Ramanujacharyaji said what Bhagwan Buddha said, what our scriptures and our Acharyas, teachers, saints said, is of social unity. If society breaks, a country disintegrates, get divided in lows and highs, divided by untouchability, then my brothers and sisters, that society cannot sustain. They are evils, centuries old evils but more old evils call for rigorous treatment with enhanced sensitivity. It happens, it can go on- the problem cannot be solved by taking this line. This is the responsibility of 125 crores countrymen, the government and the society. All will have to join hands to come out of the situation of confrontation.Brothers and Sisters, we have to fight against the social evils. We have to rise above social evils. Every citizen will have to rise and only then we will able to make strong India. We cannot make a strong India without making a strong society. Only economic progress cannot guarantee a strong India- strong society is a guarantee for a strong India and a strong society is made by ensuring social justice. Strong society is built on the foundation of social justice and therefore it is our responsibility that we give emphasis on social justice. Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, villager or city dweller, educated, literate, small or big  all 125 crore countrymen are our family. And all of us will have to get together to take our country forward and we have to work in that direction only.Brothers and Sisters, today the attention of the world goes towards the fact that India is a young nation. A country which has 800 million people less than 35 years of age, which is 65% of population  what can that country not do with its youth power. And therefore, Brothers and Sisters, the youth should get opportunities, youth should get employment, this is the demand of our times.Today, when we are moving towards the birth centenary of Pt. Deendayal Uphadhyay, we remember his idea about welfare of the last man. This was the idea of Mahatma Gandhi also. Pt. Deendayal Uphadhyay adopted the idea of Antyoday. The welfare of the last man was the central point of the political philosophy of Pt. Deendayal Uphadhyay. Under this he used to say every youth should get education, every youth should have skills and every youth should have opportunity to give shape to his dreams. To fulfil the dreams of Pt. Deendayal Uphadhyay, we have taken a number of initiatives to meet the aspirations of 800 million youths of our country. In the way that new roads are being built, the country is making more vehicles, more software is being exported, more than 50 new mobile making factories have been set up, all this provides opportunity to the youth. If we have made 2 crore toilets, somebody must have got employment. Cement and iron would have come from somewhere and wood work would have been done somewhere. As the scale of work increases, job opportunities will increase and we have worked in this direction only.In order to provide skills to crores of youth of this country, we have put Skill Development in Mission mode. We have amended the law. Though a visibly small step, but will give benefit to small shopkeepers. Model Shops and Establishment Act has been approved and now we have issued advisory to states to give an opportunity to small shopkeepers so that their shops are open till midnight 365 days on the same lines as big shopping malls. Why should a small shopkeepers close his shop after evening? We should provide for that small and poor shopkeepers open their shops till midnight all 365 days. Why we should we not provide opportunity to our sisters to work at night? We have made legal provisions so that our sisters can work during the night. We must ensure their safety and security but provide them an opportunity to work. These are the measures which will generate employment and we are working towards this direction.My fellow brothers and sisters, we dont believe and my government doesnt believe in avoiding the problems. We dont delay but confront the challenges. For doing something, problem should be faced head on. When we are celebrating Independence Day, our soldiers are on the borders to face the bullets. Some are sitting in bunkers, some dont meet their sisters even on Raksha Bandhan because they are at the borders. Lot of soldiers are working in defence forces. Our 33000 policemen have sacrificed their lives post-Independence. Shall we forget them? How can we forget them as these are the people because of whom we are leading a peaceful life. That is why we must salute them on this occasion. One-Rank One-Pension was pending for a long time. We took up this challenge and resolved this issue. Every Indian solider felt happy after the One-Rank One-Pension was resolved and announced.Our people desired that we must make public the files related to Netaji Subhas Babu. With all humility, I want to say that my government took up this issue which was being ignored and avoided for a long time. We disclosed the contents of these files. Netaji Subhass family was invited and files were made public and the process is still continuing. I have also urged other countries to make public the files related to Netaji. India has a right to know about Subhas Babu and the countrys history. We have worked in that direction.Since the days of partition, there were border disputes with Bangladesh. These disputes remained unresolved for many decades. Now, with the help and cooperation of all political parties, we have resolved the border dispute with Bangladesh. The constitutional gave us the strength.My fellow brothers and sisters, middle class persons dream of constructing a house, buy a flat. Builders show nicely printed booklet to buyers to lure them. The middle class do not have technical knowledge but keep giving builders money and yet the builders dont build the houses on time. Middle class invests their life long savings and capital in this one time investment. To protect the interests of buyers, we brought forward Real Estate Bill to regulate the builders. This measure will help the middle class home buyers.My fellow brothers and sisters, as I mentioned earlier, Shrimad Rajchandrajis 150th anniversary is now on. Mahatma Gandhi used to treat Shrimad Rajchandraji as his guru. When he was in South Africa, Gandhiji was in touch with Rajchandraji through correspondence. In one of the letters, Shrimad Rajchandraji discussed violence and non-violence with Gandhiji. Rajchandraji said that due to the existence of violence, the concept of Non-violence came into existence. The important thing is to understand, which principle is important for you or which can be utilized for welfare of mankind.Dear brothers and sisters, in our country the discussion on violence and non-violence is very natural. Humanism is ingrained in our veins. We are the people of a great cultural heritage. This country is full of diversity. This bouquet of Mother India is blessed with different fragrances, different colours, and different dreams. Brothers and Sisters, unity in diversity is our greatest strength. The mantra of unity is linked to our roots. Brothers and Sisters, in a country where there are more than 100 languages, hundreds of dialects, countless ways of dressing, countless life styles, despite that this country has remained one for centuries and the main reason for this is our cultural legacy. We know how to respect others, how to become a good host and how to take all on the path of progress. We have always followed this great tradition and therefore there is no place for violence and oppression in our country. If we have to strengthen Indias Democracy and to fulfill its dreams, the path of violence can never succeed.Today in the name of Maoism in the jungles, in the name of extremism in the border areas, in the name of terrorism on the mountains, innocent people are being killed. Mother India was continuously soaked in blood, but those following the path of terrorism achieved nothing. I want to tell these youths that this country will never tolerate terrorism and will never bow to terrorism or Maoism. I want to appeal to these youths that there is still time, shun the path of violence and try to fulfill the dream of your parents. Join the mainstream and lead a life of comfort and happiness, as the path of violence has never helped anyone.Brothers and Sisters, when we talk about foreign policy, I dont want to present before you a detailed account. The day this Government took the oath of office, we had invited SAARC leaders. Our message was clear that all our neighboring countries have a common problem and that common challenge is poverty. So all we should come together to fight poverty. By fighting with each other, we all had suffered but if we all are determined to fight poverty, we will be able to come out of the sufferings and march towards prosperity. Therefore, I invite all the neighboring countries to join their efforts to fight poverty. There cannot be greater freedom than to free the people of India from poverty and to free the people of all countries from poverty. India will feel happy when the citizens of the neighboring countries come out of poverty.Dear brothers and sisters, I want to present before the world two pictures (examples) that show the difference between those people who were brought up under the influence of humanism and those who reward terrorism. I want to tell the world and those who believe in humanity by narrating the two incidents that please weigh the incident at Peshawar, where the terrorists had gunned down innocent school children. The incident happened at Peshawar, it was a terror attack. Innocent boys and girls were killed, the temple of learning was soaked in blood by killing innocent children. There were tears in the eyes of Parliamentarians. Indian schools children were crying. Every child in India felt the shock of the death of children of Peshwar. They could not stop crying. The children of Peshwar who were killed by terrorists gave us immense pain and agony. This is our culture, borne out of humanism. On the other hand, terrorism is being glorified. When innocent people are killed in terrorist attacks, there are celebrations. What kind of life is this which is inspired by terrorism? How governments are formed through inspiration of terrorism. The world will understand this difference clearly. That is enough for me.Today from the ramparts of Red Fort, I want to greet and express my thanks to some people. In the last few days, people of Balochistan, Gilgit, Pakistan Occupied Kashmir have thanked me, have expressed gratitude, and expressed good wishes for me. The people who are living far away, whom I have never seen, never met  such people have expressed appreciation for Prime Minister of India, for 125 crore countrymen. This is an honour for our countrymen.Brothers and Sisters, today when we are celebrating 70 years of Independence, we remember the contribution of our freedom fighters. Today, for the respected family members of these freedom fighters, the Government has decided to increase the pension by 20%. So the freedom fighter who used to get Rs. 25,000 earlier will get Rs. 30,000 now. This is a small offering from my side to the sacrifices made by these freedom fighters.Brothers and Sisters, when we talk about the history of our freedom struggle, a lot is spoken about a few people. In fact, in some cases, it is more than necessary. But in our freedom struggle, the contribution of our tribals living in the forests was incomparable. They lived in jungles. We may have heard about Birsa Munda but there is hardly any tribal district which did not make sacrifices since 1857 till we got freedom. What is freedom? What is struggle against slavery? They have taught us with their sacrifices. But our coming generations are not fully aware of this history. The Government desires and is planning permanent museums in the States where these tribals lived, struggled against the Britishers and refused to be bowed down. The Government will work to make such museums in different states so that the coming generations may know how our tribals were far ahead in making sacrifices.Brothers and sisters, in issues relating to price rise, some things are much talked about but our experience is that even if a person in a poor household gets sick, his entire economy is shattered. Even the marriage of daughter gets stalled, the education of children suffers. Sometimes, no food can be arranged. The health care services are getting costlier and hence today from the rampart of Red Fort, our government is announcing an important step for the health care of such families which are below the poverty line.

According to Registrar of Companies (RoC) records, he resigned from the firm on July 5, three days before being inducted into the council of ministers. The company filed his resignation with the RoC only on July 26.Yerawar, earlier, had a 14.28 per cent stake in Chintamani Agrotech, which he later diluted to 1.9 per cent, according to the companys latest available annual report of March 2015.Gadkari was also with the company since its inception and resigned as a director on August 31, 2011, while Fadnavis joined the firm on October 23, 2009, and resigned on May 21, 2012, as per RoC records.Unlike Yerawar, neither Fadnavis nor Gadkari had any shareholding with the company, an analysis of its financial statements shows.Chintamani Agrotech  with zero turnover for the first several years, low income from sales, high reserves and substantial landholding without any operations  is a subsidiary of Jinbhuvish Powertech Pvt Ltd.Gadkari did not respond to text messages and questionnaires emailed to his office.Fadnavis said: I was associated very briefly, but I resigned and opted out because I couldnt contribute any value or time to the project. I dont know the status of the project.He added that the government had recently passed an Act that enables original landowners to secure their land back as per current rates if the property was acquired for a specific project that failed to take off within a stipulated period.The retrospective applicability needs to be checked, he said.Minister of State Yerawar said the power project could not take off due to a financial crunch and is not likely to start soon. The situation on the ground is still the same and I plan to resign as director of Chintamani Agrotech now I am a minister of state, he said when The Indian Express spoke to him on July 16.The plan was to have an integrated power plant with sugar and ethanol production. But then, policies changed and the government stopped giving loans for the sugar component. It was difficult to raise finances for the project and ultimately it could not take off. The company only has the land, purchased privately with proper permissions, he said.But Uttam Ingale, another director of Chintamani Agrotech and a former BJP legislator from Yavatmal, claimed the project was set to begin. The background work is going on. It is in the final stages. Some NOCs are awaited and finances need to be put in place, Ingale said.The company proposed to set up a sugar plant with a capacity of 3,500 tonnes of cane per day and a 30-mw co-generation power plant along with a 45 kilo litres per day ethanol plant at Mahagaon in Yavatmal.Watch Video: Whats making news[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=videoseries?list=PLrDg7LoYgk9wv_QK-mHWFxTf8After its incorporation in 2001, Chintamani Agrotech acquired 127 acres in Bijora village of Mahagaon taluka in Yavatmal to set up the plant in 2002-03, Yerawar said.Devidas Mohakar, a resident of Mahagaon and a former member of the local zilla parishad, said, At the time of buying the land, the company members convinced farmers that they would set up a power plant and give jobs to members of their families. But nothing happened. Then the other company, Jinbhuvish, bought another 300-350 acres of adjacent land for the power project. But nothing has moved.Jinbhuvish Powertech, Chintamani Agrotechs holding company, owns 89.37 per cent of the firm. The company was incorporated in September 2006 originally as Aarya Financial Services Pvt Lt to provide consultancy services related to securities and deal in financial instruments, according to RoC documents.The company was started by a Nagpur-based entrepreneur, Manish Mehta, who was also a founder member of Chintamani Agrotech.Following the long wait for the plant to take off, a group of original land owners approached the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court in 2011, seeking the cancellation of sale deeds. The court disposed of the case, saying that registered documents of sale deeds could not be challenged through a writ petition.The landowners also wrote letters to the Collectors office in Yavatmal and to the state revenue department, saying the land in question was tribal land, which the company purchased after promising jobs to the owners. They said that the government should now reverse the sale deeds and restore the land back to its original tribal owners.Mohakar said, There has been no action on these letters. Some farmers have also started cultivating on what used to be their land at Bijora.As per land records, Chintamani Agrotech currently owns at least 64 acres at Bijora, which the company converted to non-agricultural land in 2009. The land is worth Rs 13.62 crore, according to the company auditors report as of March 2015. This newspaper was able to trace the purchase of 37.04 acres of Chintamani Agrotechs current landholding at Bijora to May 2002, when the company paid a total Rs 9.86 lakh for the land parcels.Besides, Jinbhuvish Power Generations, another subsidiary of Jinbhuvish Powertech, owns 356.5 acres in Bijora and the neighbouring village of Dhanmukh, according to records. As per the governments annual statement of rates, the land is worth nearly Rs 52 crore.Some of these land parcels were acquired from Chintamani Agrotech. For instance, on August 26, 2011, Chintamani Agrotech sold nearly 47.5 acres to Jinbhuvish Power Generations for Rs 9.01 crore in Dhanmukh.Similarly, there are also records of transactions between August and October 2011 of Chintamani Agrotech selling land to Amarupa Engineering & Mining, in which Manish Mehtas brother Nilesh is a director, with the land ultimately being in the name of Jinbhuvish Power Generations.Chintamani Agrotech, which changed its registered address at least four times in 15 years , from Yavatmal to Mumbai to Nagpur and then to Uttar Pradesh, had no revenue to report until 2010 when it for the first time posted a turnover of Rs 4.39 lakh. The companys annual report of March 2015 says that the firm derives hundred per cent of its turnover from the manufacture of sugar, and puts the revenue from sales and other income at Rs 4.47 crore.Besides Yerawar and Ingale, the firms current crop of directors includes Nagpur-based Ravindra Yerawar and Avinash Agrawal, and Jinbhuvish Powertech directors Nilesh Chanandrikapure and Pankaj Kaushal.Like Chintamani Agrotech, Jinbhuvish Powertech, the holding company has also reported a zero turnover since inception as against a large amount of loans and investments. According to the companys latest available profit and lost statement, it had no revenue from operations, but Rs 14,853 from other income. At the same time, it had reserves of Rs 237.9 crore and long-term investments of Rs 284.2 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Now the man who jumped parties and loyalties with ease is charged in a Rs 800 cr scam, and has real-estate and business interests worth crores. Shubhangi Khapre, Zeeshan Shaikh and Atikh Rashid on Chhagan BhujbalSometime in the fifties, at an inter-college competition, a young man had gone up on stage to deliver a power-packed performance in a one-act play. The winner that day was Chhagan Bhujbal, a student of Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute College in Matunga, Mumbai, and the runner-up was Amjad Khan (of later-day Sholay fame).Those who know Bhujbal, the 69-year-old NCP leader who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 14 for alleged corruption during his stint as PWD Minister in two terms of the Congress-NCP government of 2004 to 2014, say thats one skill that has stayed with him  theatrics. All he needed was a stage and in his four-decade political career, he had several  first with the Shiv Sena, followed by the Congress and then the NCP.Former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Chhagan Bhujbal (in black coat). Archive/Express Photo Former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Chhagan Bhujbal (in black coat). Archive/Express PhotoMuch before this rise and fall was a story, one as unexceptional as any. Young Bhujbal and his siblings grew up in the narrow lanes of Bagwanpura in Nashik, where his family lived cheek by jowl with several Muslim households. His parents died early and the family moved to Mumbai when Bhujbal was two. My siblings and I were raised by my mothers aunt Jankibai (whom he called grandmother). She was a feisty lady, Bhujbal had recalled in an earlier interview. Jankibais husband was a policeman and the family struggled to make ends meet.Those were tough days. Bhujbal would later often talk about a family function in his childhood home in Nashik, where he had to dilute the curry with water because he feared there wouldnt be enough to go around. The story goes that in Mazagaon, Chhagan and his elder brother Magan would trudge from their one-room chawl in Anjirwadi to the Byculla vegetable market every morning where members of the Mali community (the OBC community of gardeners to which the family belonged) would pool money and help the brothers buy vegetables.The two brothers and their aunt would then sell the vegetables outside their Mazagaon home. The Bhujbals later managed to secure a 35 sq ft vending spot for themselves at the Byculla vegetable market. The bond that Bhujbal shared with his elder brother during those years of struggle is one of the reasons why he took his nephew, Magans son Sameer, under his wings after his brothers death in the early 80s. Sameer is now in judicial custody in the money laundering case that the ED has filed against Bhujbal and his relatives. The ED is probing alleged kickbacks received by the Bhujbal family for favouring contractors in construction of the Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi and the Kalina Central Library in Mumbai.Chhagan Bhujbal and Bal Thackeray. Archive/Express Photo Chhagan Bhujbal and Bal Thackeray. Archive/Express PhotoBhujbal, the man who borrowed money to sell vegetables, would later come to be known as the strongman from Nashik who combined opportunism with calculated risks to further both his politics and business. As a senior NCP leader says, Bhujbal struck a perfect balance between his politics and business. But it appears he took some wrong decisions and entrusted his nephew Sameer with his business. He should have exercised caution and ensured good advisers around him when in power.The man, his empireThe sprawling campus of the Mumbai Educational Trust (MET) in Bandra stands as testimony to Bhujbals business acumen. The campus, spread across prime real-estate, came up in 1989 and offers multiple courses such as business management, engineering and pharmacy and even has a rishikul for children. The Trust also runs Bhujbal Knowledge City, an educational hub with four colleges in Nashik.Chhagan Bhujbal during a 2012 NCP state meeting in Mumbai. Archive/Express Photo/Prashant Nadkar Chhagan Bhujbal during a 2012 NCP state meeting in Mumbai. Archive/Express Photo/Prashant NadkarUnlike politicians who own sugar mills and district banks, I decided to invest in education. Those accusing me of charging high fees should know that I have to pay electricity bills of Rs 25 to 30 lakh a month, Bhujbal once said.But in 2013, Bhujbal had a fallout with his chartered accountant Sunil Karve, with whom he had set up MET. Karve had accused Bhujbals family of misappropriating funds from the Trust.Over the years, Bhujbal acquired prime land in Nashik and Lonavala, among other places. The Bhujbals family home in Nashik, inside the sprawling Bhujbal Farms, underwent a major revamp in 2012-14 when Bhujbal was PWD minister.Its a huge mansion and is situated in the heart of the 5-acre Bhujbal Farms, which has a swimming pool, a tennis court, library, home theatre and a mini auditorium. The mansion is known to have imported furniture and expensive artefacts. It was built in phases over two years. The family moved here in May-June 2014, says a Nashik-based journalist with a Marathi newspaper. He says very few people among those who have access to Bhujbal Farms  and there arent too many  can go to the mansion.Former Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, Vamrao Mahadhik, Chhagan Bhujbal, Promod Navalkar and Manohar Joshi.

Archive/Express PhotoMost of those who visit Bhujbal Farms are not allowed to go beyond the office building. Only family members and very close aides can go to the bungalow, says a former aide of the Bhujbals. Bhujbal Farms is enclosed within a 7-foot-high compound wall and a dense growth of Ashoka and bamboo plantation within these walls block out any view of the mansion from outside.About 15 km away, at Shilapur village on the Nashik-Aurangabad Road, stands Armstrong Energy Pvt Ltd, a biomass power plant owned by Bhujbals son Pankaj and nephew Sameer. The name Armstrong is a translation of Bhujbal.The plant, which was supposed to have generated 6 MW electricity, has been dysfunctional since it was set up in 2009. A guard at the entrance claims repair works are on inside and says he is under instruction not to allow anyone to enter.Chhagan Bhujbal, former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Archive/Express Photo Chhagan Bhujbal, former Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Sharad Pawar. Archive/Express PhotoTrucks would sometimes bring in bagasse from sugar factories. But the plant has hardly functioned  if it was open for a day, it would remain closed for two, says a tea stall owner outside the gate. Officials at the Nashik District Co-operative Bank says the firm had defaulted on a Rs 11-crore loan. It hasnt paid back a single penny. Since Bhujbal enjoyed a lot of clout, nobody uttered a word. The firm again applied for a Rs 20-crore loan. But by this time, the state had appointed an administrator for the bank as it had run into huge losses and the bank rejected the loan straightaway, an official of the bank says on condition of anonymity.According to a complaint filed by Anjali Damania of the Aam Aadmi Party with the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), the contract for furnishing Maharashtra Sadan was given to Armstrong Energy and another company owned by the family. Not so far from the biogas plant is Jai Electronics, formerly owned by actress Amisha Patels father Jai Patel. After this firm reportedly defaulted on a Rs 11.75 crore loan from Canara Bank, it was bought by Armstrong Energy a few years ago. At the entrance gate, which remains shut, is an Armstrong banner.The Bhujbals own several other properties in Nashik  besides Bhujbal Knowledge City, they own Armstrong Water Purifier, Chandrai Bungalow, Ganesh Bungalow, an eight-acre agricultural plot, among others. Laxman Savji, a BJP leader from Nashik, blames Bhujbal for making the politics of Nashik money-oriented. All this has happened in the last 10-12 years. Now it has became impossible for a common political worker to fight elections. Before Bhujbal came to Nashik, he had been a mayor of Mumbai. People hoped he would bring in change, but during his reign, only money and muscle ruled, he says.Chhagan Bhujbal with Bal Thackeray. Archive/Express Photo Chhagan Bhujbal with Bal Thackeray. Archive/Express PhotoIn Nashik, there are several stories of his alleged high-handedness. In 2009, then Nashik police commissioner V D Mishra reportedly attempted to extern four politicians with known criminal records, including one Kailas Mudaliar, who is said to be close to Bhujbal, but the act allegedly led to Mishra being transferred. It was only after Nashik residents took out protest marches that the suspension was revoked.His critics also accuse him of treating Nashik as his fiefdom, having ensured an Assembly ticket for his son (Pankaj is MLA from Nandgaon) and a parliamentary ticket for his nephew (Sameer was elected Nashik MP in the 2009 elections), while keeping Yeola (from where he is MLA) for himself.Despite several attempts by The Sunday Express to contact Pankaj Bhujbal, who is also named in the ED case, for this story, he remained unavailable for comment. Over the years, Bhujbals real-estate interests spread beyond Mumbai and Nashik too. In June 2015, after cases were registered against Bhujbal over the Maharashtra Sadan scam, the Maharashtra ACB raided his property in Achvan village, 15 km from the hill station town of Lonavala.According to ACB officials, the estate, which oversees a valley, is spread over 65 acres and has a six-bedroom bungalow replete with rare artefacts. The estate also has a pond and a stream with a barrage over it.Villagers say the family bought the property and bungalow around eight years ago. As long as he (Bhujbal) was in power, he used to come here, especially during festivals. The family would always be here around New Year. But no one has come here since last years raid, says a villager.The politicianNobody is questioning his politics or leadership, says BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, whose complaint to the ACB in 2012 brought out the Maharashtra Sadan scam. There are serious corruption cases which have been established and he is facing the consequences. But if he has done something wrong, the law will apply to him as to any other citizen, he says. As a diploma student of engineering in Matunga, Bhujbal had attended a Bal Thackeray rally at Shivaji Park, where he was so mesmerised by the Sena chiefs oratory that he decided to join the Shiv Sena. With his bombastic and aggressive style, Bhujbal was a natural fit in the party.NCP chief Sharad Pawar with party leader Chhagan Bhujbal during a meeting with party workers of Thane district in Mumbai. PTI Photo NCP chief Sharad Pawar with party leader Chhagan Bhujbal during a meeting with party workers of Thane district in Mumbai. PTI PhotoIn 1973, Thackeray helped him become a BMC corporator. Bhujbal would later go on to become mayor twice. In 1985, he became Shiv Sena MLA from Mazagaon, which he represented for two terms. But soon, things started souring for Bhujbal within the Sena, especially with the rise of the soft-spoken and tactful Manohar Joshi. In 1991, at the peak of the Mandal agitation, Bhujbal decided to quit the Sena, saying the party was against OBC reservation. He had by then fashioned himself as an OBC politician, but those who know him have always maintained that the real reason he left the party was because he felt sidelined. After the 1990 Assembly elections, when the Sena-BJP alliance won 85 seats, Bhujbal thought he would be named leader of Opposition. Instead, Thackeray chose Manohar Joshi.After he quit the Sena, Bhujbal joined the Congress led by Sharad Pawar. He reportedly spent 10 days in a safehouse in Nagpur to ensure he was not attacked by the Sena.When Pawar left the Congress to float the NCP in 1999, Bhujbal followed the Maratha leader. The same year, the Shiv Sena lost power and the Congress-NCP government came to power. Bhujbal was made Deputy CM and also handled the Home portfolio. As Home Minister, he did the unthinkable, moving against his mentor Thackeray. In August 2000, he cleared the arrest of Thackeray over his inflammatory writings in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana. It was a technical arrest and Thackeray was released on bail a few hours later, but the damage had been done and the Thackerays declared war. It took about 15 years for the two to patch up.Inside Bhujbal Farm: The 5 acre premise houses several bungalows  with a recently added palace and an office is on Agra Road, Nashik.

Express Photo/Pavan KhengreFor someone who has never hidden his ambition for the CMs post, the Deputy CMs post seemed like the start of bigger things. But ironically, thats when the slide began. In 2003, he had to resign over his alleged role in the fake revenue stamp case, popularly called the Telgi scam. Though he subsequently received a clean chit from the investigating agencies, he sat out for the rest of the governments term. But when the Congress-NCP came back to power in 2004, Bhujbal was made PWD minister. For someone who had been Deputy CM before, that was a letdown but it was a key portfolio. One that has returned to haunt him in the form of the Maharashtra Sadan case.High net-worth: ASSETS ATTACHED* The ED has attached a 97,000-square-metre Navi Mumbai property worth Rs 160 crore belonging to the Bhujbal family in the name of Devisha Infrastructure.

The reason is not just the prospect of a bumper crop on the back of a great monsoon so far, resulting in increased plantings in the current kharif season.After two torrid years of their incomes taking a hit from drought as well as poor produce realisations, Indian farmers finally seem set for better times.The reason is not just the prospect of a bumper crop on the back of a great monsoon so far, resulting in increased plantings in the current kharif season. No less important is a second factor  a gradual recovery of farm commodity prices from the lows of the past couple of years.Between January and July, the Food and Agricultural Organisations Food Price Index (FPI) has risen 8.4 per cent, from 149.3 to 161.9. This is also reflected in the global prices of most agri-commodities currently ruling higher than their levels from a year ago. Although nowhere close to their peaks  the FPI scaled an all-time-high of 237.7 in February 2011  the underlying trend suggests that farm prices may have bottomed out.A correction was inevitable after a prolonged phase of low prices. We are probably seeing that happening, though a clearer picture will emerge from the next few auctions at Global Dairy Trade (an online marketplace of New Zealands milk products giant Fonterra), said R G Chandramogan, chairman of Hatsun Agro Product Ltd, Indias largest private dairy company.In the latest fortnightly auction on August 2, skim milk powder prices averaged $1,965 per tonne, having traded at their lowest of $1,419 one year ago. The drop in prices, from a high of $5,142 per tonne in early April 2013, had led to Indias powder exports falling from Rs 2,717.56 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 292.57 crore in 2015-16. As dairies slashed procurement, farmers in states like Maharashtra were forced to sell cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre  against Rs 25-26 when exports were booming  even amidst drought-induced fodder and water shortages.But while milk powder prices may be just looking up, there is no such ambiguity with regard to sugar and cotton. Global sugar prices have almost doubled in the last one year. With ex-factory rates in Uttar Pradesh, too, firming up from under Rs 23 to about Rs 36 per kg, the pressure for hiking cane prices for growers ahead of next years Assembly elections would be obvious.The outlook for cotton prices has similarly brightened after a global slump, reducing Indias exports of the nature fibre from $3.64 billion in 2013-14 to $1.94 billion in 2015-16. The accompanying decline in domestic realisations for kapas (raw, un-ginned cotton), from Rs 5,000-5,500 to Rs 4,000-4,200 per quintal, apparently had some role in the setbacks to the ruling BJP in Gujarats district and taluka panchayat polls last November.But that has changed significantly. In the past three months alone, international cotton prices have surged from around 69 cents to over 81 cents per pound. The US Department of Agriculture on Friday forecast global ending stocks for 2016-17 at 89.61 million bales, the lowest since 2011-12 when prices were really on fire.We can expect kapas realisations to be better than last year, said Dhiren N Sheth, president, Cotton Association of India. That would be great news, especially for Maharashtras farmers who have sown more area under cotton this time. Having endured back-to-back droughts, a combination of increased production, courtesy copious monsoon rains, and higher prices couldnt have come at a better time.Neelkanth Mishra, India equity strategist for the Swiss investment banker Credit Suisse, estimates that the countrys gross value of crops and livestock production  farm incomes, in other words  registered an average annual growth of 13.9 per cent from 2004-05 and 2013-14. The contribution of global prices to this can be seen from overall agricultural exports, which soared from $7.53 billion in 2003-04 to $43.25 billion in 2013-14.The subsequent two years, however, witnessed the end of the global commodity boom. As prices collapsed, so did the value of Indias agri-exports to $32.53 billion in 2015-16. Farm income growth also slid to 4.8 per cent in 2014-15 and 2.8 per cent in 2015-16, according to Mishra.An example of what global prices can do is provided by rubber. In 2011-12, average prices of benchmark RSS-4 grade sheets were Rs 208.50 per kg in Kottayam, Kerala. On a production of 903,700 tonnes, the value of this rubber would have been roughly Rs 18,842 crore. But in 2015-16, the average price was Rs 113.06/kg, a level uneconomical for many growers. As they discontinued tapping, production fell to 562,000 tonnes and that was worth just Rs 6,354 crore  a third of what growers grossed in 2011-12.But like in other farm commodities, a mild revival of fortunes is now visible even in rubber. RSS-4 prices in Kottayam have climbed to Rs 142/kg, up from Rs 117.50 at this time last year. If replicated across other crops in a good monsoon year, there can be nothing better for the economy and, perhaps, for the NDA government as the next election season approaches.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Renuka Puri/ file) Nirmala Sitharaman during the parliament House. (Express Photo by Renuka Puri/ file)The fall in Indias exports have been arrested in May and now it is time to extend incentives to boost the overseas shipments, government said on Friday.Although the pick up in exports may be slow but the bottoming out has happened, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. I think from now, it will show slow but steady rise Last months indicators show that it has now come down to 0.79 per cent, which is still a situation where we have to do a lot more to allow it to pick up.So it is a time when the help will have to be extended whether in the form of interest subvention or in the form of any kind of incentives for exports. We have been looking at sectorally, she told reporters in New Delhi.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe remarks assume significance as exports fell the 18th month in a row in May, though marginally by 0.79 per cent, to USD 22.17 billion as several non-oil sectors such as engineering and gems and jewellery saw a rise in outward shipments.The decline in May was lowest since December 2014. However, the minister said she is cautious but I can see that the fall is getting arrested and pick up is slowly showing up.Further talking about the 20 per cent customs duty on sugar exports, Sitharaman said the move would help in increasing availability of the commodity in the domestic market.We do not want any speculative rise in the prices of sugar. In order to make sure that there is enough sugar available for the Indian market, this step has been taken , she said.Government has imposed 20 per cent customs duty on sugar exports to boost domestic supply and check prices which are ruling high at Rs 40/kg. India, the worlds second largest sugar producer after Brazil, has exported 1.6 million tonnes of the sweetener so far in the 2015-16 marketing year (October-September).Further exports are unlikely to take place with this decision. When asked whether government is considering to extend minimum import price on steel, she said the ministry would talk about the issue only when the time would come.The Minimum Import Price (MIP) in its current form is in place till early August. According to an official, MIP is not a WTO compliant measure and India should consider measures like antidumping duty  which is WTO compliant  to deal with cheap imports of commodities including steel.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The order has pegged the value of the two assets at Rs 55 crore.The ED, official sources said, has also put prohibitory orders on the running factory, identified as Girna Sugar mill, and the land located adjacent to it.The agency, according to sources, found in its probe that the mill was purchased by Bhujbals firm after gross under-valuation at Rs 27 crore and was purchased as part of an auction conducted by the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) in 2010.They said proceeds of crime of money laundering funds generated by the former Deputy Chief Minister of the state and his family members were used to purchase these two assets.This is the fourth attachment order issued by the agency in the case and it has already attached assets, both movable and immovable, worth Rs 280 crore earlier.An attachment order under PMLA laws is aimed to deprive the accused from obtaining benefits of their alleged ill-gotten wealth and the accused parties can appeal against the order before the Adjudicating Authority of the said Act within 180 days.Bhujbal, along with his ex-Member of Parliament nephew Samir have been arrested in the case by the ED earlier and they are at present in jail.The agency has filed two FIRs against Bhujbal, his son Pankaj and Samir and others under the provisions of PMLA, based on Mumbai Polices ACB FIRs, to probe allegedirregularities in the construction of Delhi-based state guest house Maharashtra Sadan and the Kalina land grabbing case.The Bombay High Court, in December, 2014, had constituted a Special Investigation Team comprising the ED and the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to conduct the inquiry against the politician and others.The ACB complaint names Pankaj and Samir and they had been booked under IPC Sections related to cheating, criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and relevant provisions of Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act.The agency in a statement said illegal gratification and bribe money collected by Chhagan Bhujbal was apparently used by way of share application money by Ms Parvesh Constructions Pvt Ltd and Ms Armstrong Energy Pvt Ltd.These funds were subsequently laundered and channeled to Ms Armstrong Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and thereafter placed in the property which is Girna Sugar Mill, situated at Nashik, to mask its origin and to portray it as untainted.It said the mill and land attached today was acquired by Ms Armstrong Infrastructure Pvt Ltd through auction proceedings from DRT for a total acquisition cost of Rs27,82,55,010.Apart from a bank loan of Rs 10 crore the remaining payment of Rs 17,82,55,010 was made from the tainted funds received from Ms Armstrong Energy Pvt Ltd and Ms Parvesh Construction Pvt Ltd, thereby rendering the said Girna Sugar Mill as a tainted asset, it said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

There are four women and 15 men (among them) who have become pilots. Last year, 558 tribal youths made it to GUJCET (a combined test for entrance to medical and engineering colleges) because of special coaching classes for tribals started by the government, he said.He also said intervention by the BJP-led Gujarat government has stopped tribals from conversion. The minister said Christian missionaries were carrying out religious conversion several years ago because of poverty in the region but that has stopped now.In Dangs, they distributed sugar and wheat as a lure to convert poor tribal people to Christianity, (but) we led a revolution and today we can say for sure that conversion has stopped because of governments intervention, Patel was quoted as saying by PTI.Releasing the vision document in Ahmedabad after it was unveiled in New Delhi on March 21, Bhagwan Sahay, in-charge of the outfit in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, said, The vision document is divided into two parts  governance and administration; and the social and economic sector. It is an attempt to reflect the challenges faced by over 12 crore tribal population in the country. These can be overcome leading to social harmony only if we are sensitive towards these challenges.Similarly, Harsh Chauhan of Janjati Suraksha Manch from Indore, put stressed on an urgent need for a National Tribal Niti.

(Experss Photo: Amit Chakravarty) A cattle camp in Wanzarwadi, Beed. (Experss Photo: Amit Chakravarty)THERE ARE 1,400 animals at the cattle camp in Wanzarwadi, a hamlet near Dhamangaon in Ashti taluka, Beed. According to Ghanshyam Ram Pondhe, 12, Rani is the best of these, always docile, never shuffling around as he sits down to milk the three-year-old cow. Having spent longer days at the camp over the last two months, returning home only to sleep, Rani is his favourite person in the world right now.I wake up, milk Rani, wash up, sell the 10-12 litres at the milk market and then go to school, cycling, he says. The Class VI student says his father, Ram, works at a forging unit in Ashti, about 12 km away. He took the job after consecutive crops failed on their one-acre land. Aai (mum) would work too, if she got something.Some of his school friends are at the camp, listening as men spend their afternoons complaining about no work, empty fields and a credit tap wound tightly close. In fact, as Marathwadas summer rages on amid an unprecedented water scarcity, more and more gatherings take place in the fodder camps. For this is where villagers now congregate, to avail free fodder and water for animals, their last remaining asset after three droughts in four years. There are now over 2,75,000 animals in 297 camps in Latur, Beed and Osmanabad, the worst-hit districts.Share This Article Related Article Weather extremes: The deluge after the droughtWeather extremes: The deluge after the drought Marathwada: All govt schemes in place, yet 59 more farmers end life than last yearMarathwada: All govt schemes in place, yet 59 more farmers end life than last year Cattle feed to tankers: Why its hard for relief to reach and be monitoredCattle feed to tankers: Why its hard for relief to reach and be monitored Cattle economics: When milk turns sour for parched and singed MarathwadaCattle economics: When milk turns sour for parched and singed Marathwada Drought country faces worst year: Waiting for a drop before dawnDrought country faces worst year: Waiting for a drop before dawn Failed crops, parched fields, now Marathwada faces the great thirstWith most small and marginal farmers in Marathwada having witnessed four consecutive crop failures, the narrative of the drought has moved out of the fields. There is nothing at home, so I spend the entire day here. Theres nothing to do but stare at animals, and fall into exhausted sleep when its too hot. But whats there to do at home? asks Naseemabi Shaikh, 50, at the Kasari cattle camp just outside Ashti town. With 20 mouths to feed and no water in her village wells, she finds it easier to live in the camp, going home to cook a meal that she packs a small portion of for herself, to eat with her 12 animals. At least theres water here, keeping the animals alive will give me milk to sell.In Nandurghat village of Kaij taluka, villagers have brought to cattle camps everything from clotheslines to battery-operated water-coolers, utensils, gunny bags of clothes and extra bedding for the aged. Toilet? We just sit by the roadside at the back of the camp, says Vijobai Hange, 48. Her back aches from crouching all day in a temporary tent fashioned out of saris and poles. And from walking  to home and back daily, 3 km one way. She leaves her animals behind in the camp at night, in the care of a neighbour.Where animals remain an asset to care for, the villages empty out in the mornings as people leave for the cattle camps or to find work in towns. Elsewhere, where villagers have even smaller land holdings or traditionally eke out a living as landless labourers, officials admit there are no surveys conducted but distress migration is apparent on a large scale.Approaching Bedarwadi, about 20 km from Ashti, its pitch dark at 7 pm. The village has had no electricity for a week, but nobody knows why. Silhouettes of 30-odd children bobbing in excitement at the visitors is sign that the village is here. Only old people are left here, and children, says Mangal Bodre. The 60-year-old is cooking dinner for a grandson left behind with her  his six-year-old sister has gone to the cane fields with her parents while a brother, aged 11, is living with an uncle elsewhere. At least one boy is well cared for. I was sick last year and they spent Rs 8,000 on the hospital stay. Now my husband has chest pain and we dont know what to do.Of the 550-600 strong male population, 400 have gone to Belapur. Belapur is an overarching term to describe the location of any sugar factory anywhere in the state, where the men have migrated for the four-month sugarcane cutting season.Everybody is bitter. Naseemabi says she visits nobody, attends no functions and talks to nobody outside the cattle camp. Bodre says there is nobody to take care of her if she falls ill now, no way to repay loans they took for her hospitalisation, nothing she believes her grandson can look forward to in the near future.Beed Collector Naval Kishore Ram calls it a natural disaster unfolding slowly, over months.Local BJP leader Vijay Golwar says, This region always bucked the trend of suicides in Vidarbha, because we have been traditionally habituated to dealing with cracked fields and arid landscapes. Golwar says Marathwadas season of suicides is on account of people not having a chance to heal before the next tragedy. He adds, Now, in village after village, Marathwadas people are dependent on government dole and waiting for more. But its Chandrabha, widow of Kalyan Khomne who killed himself last June in Nandurghat village in Kaij, who puts it succinctly: I realise why he did it.

(Source: Express photo by Vasant Prabhu/ file)A land deal he entered into jointly with tainted BJP leader Eknath Khadses kin 15 years ago has landed senior Maharashtra BJP minister Girish Mahajan in trouble, with the Opposition seeking his resignation for concealing the deal in his election affidavit, and cornering land at the expense of poor farmers.Mahajan, who holds the water resources portfolio in the Devendra Fadnavis government, allegedly purchased a five-acre land in Manpur village in North Maharashtras Jalgaon on January 1, 2002, for a declared price of Rs 1.11 lakh. Documents reveal the land was one among eight land parcels totalling 86 acre bought in the garb of setting up a private sugar factory proposed by Eknath Khadse-promoted Tapi Purna Sugar Factory Ltd. But the sugar factory was never built.Records also show that while the land purchase was made for starting the sugar factory, the companys directors including Khadses kin and Mahajan purchased about 46 acre land in an individual capacity.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe main trouble for Mahajan stems from concealing details of the five-acre plot bought in his name in the election affidavits he filed in 2004, 2009 and 2014. Mahajan admits this mistake. All this time, I was under the impression that the land was purchased in the companys name. I have not even seen the land nor have I earned any income from it, said Mahajan.The Congress Wednesday demanded that the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis act against him for this non-disclosure but the water resources minister appeared to pass the buck to Khadse. He is the companys chief promoter. The board under him finalised the land deal and made the purchases. It was the company that paid the consideration value for the purchase, Mahajan said.Both Khadse and Mahajan hail from Jalgaon. The latter is now seen as Khadses arch-rival. In fact, after Khadse lost his chair in the Maharashtra government over impropriety in another land deal, Mahajan is seen as Jalgaons powerhouse.Congress leader Sachin Sawant mounted an offensive claiming land records suggest the land purchased in Mahajans name was originally co-owned by members of the Mahar community, a scheduled caste. While Sawant raised allegations it was Mahar Watan land, which cannot be bought under norms, Mahajan denied the allegation. I have reconfirmed with revenue authorities. It is not a Mahar Watan land.Activist Anjali Damania, who first blew the lid off the dubious land deal, reiterated Sawants allegations claiming she had interacted with the original owners who feel victimised. Sawant also alleged that the land was cornered at concessional rate using lure of employment in the sugar factory. Damania, who claimed Khadse had a bigger role to play in the land deal, alleged that purchasing land from farmers when the sugar factory was not even registered with the Sugar Commissionerate indicates its dubiousness further.On July 3, 2010, Shankar Patil, an original land owner, had obtained information under the Right to Information Act from the Sugar Commissionerate that the factory wasnt yet registered. The entire motive was to corner the plot, Damania alleged.The activist claimed land owners were coerced into surrendering their land, an allegation Mahajan denied. The land owners sold the plot voluntarily, Mahajan said.Khadse, meanwhile, has been refuting all allegations against him as baseless.Mahajan shared some light on how the company, which also has other BJP leaders including MP Haribhau Jawale and Maharashtra legislator Gurumukh Jagwani as shareholders, was formed following the Centres policy to boost ethanol production in 2001. All of us contributed Rs 10,000 to begin with, Mahajan said, while admitting that the plans never materialised.Some land owners claimed they were forced to sign sale agreements. Damania also showed a public notice published on May 10, 2001 where Eknath Khadse, in his capacity as the companys chief promoter, had unilaterally declared that the companys board of directors had decided to purchase the eight land parcels.In another bid to corner the BJP on dubious land deals, the Congress alleged wrongdoing in a land allegedly purchased by BJP state president Raosaheb Danve and his family in Bhokardan in Jalna. Danve claimed the land deal was entered into by his father over three decades ago, and had followed all legal formalities. But Sawant demanded probe. Danve accused the Opposition of playing politics and raising baseless allegations. An insider in the BJP, accusing the Opposition of raking up baseless matters, conceded that the controversial land deals involving BJP leaders had dented the party image in the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: express photo by Prashant Nadkar)Ministers in the Maharashtra government, who are facing accusations of graft and impropriety became the target of the Opposition on Friday but Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis put up a spirited defence of each.Criticise us for the wrongs we do, but do not defame my ministers with baseless accusations, Fadnavis told the Opposition benches.Earlier on Thursday, the Opposition had put the government in a tight spot by levelling accusations against 20 out of the 39 ministers.In a bid to rebuild his governments image, Fadnavis, while replying to Oppositions offensive, took almost everybody by surprise by giving a clean chit to all these ministers. Incidentally Friday was also the Chief Ministers birthday.Fadnavis even defended cabinet ministers Sambhaji Nilengekar Patil and Jaikumar Rawal against whom criminal proceedings have been initiated.His hour-long speech also had a subtle warning for Opposition leaders. My government is trying to change the negative perception about Maharashtra which was created due to corruption that went on for the last 15 years. If I start delving into the past, all those responsible for frauds in district banks, dairies, and cotton mills will stand exposed. But jau dhya, aaj birthday aahe. (But let it be since today is also the birthday). Sources said this was a veiled dig at former Deputy Chief Minister and NCP legislator Ajit Pawar, who was also celebrating his birthday on Friday.While defending his ministers, the chief minister, however, did not give ousted minister Eknath Khadse a clean chit in the Pune MIDC land deal case. He only said that a one-member committee was probing the matter. On Thursday, Khadse, while defending himself had taken a veiled dig at Fadnavis. Later, NCPs Jayant Patil was seen rubbing salt on Khadses wounds. Why should there be one rule for other ministers, another for Khadse, he asked sarcastically, while interacting with newspersons. It seems to us that the CM is making sure that Khadse would remain out of his cabinet, he said.Following the CMs speech, the Opposition, however, created a furore, claiming that the CMs reply was not satisfactory. There was pandemonium after the Presiding Chair, Yogesh Sagar, halted discussion on the issue. Sagar later adjourned the house for 10 minutes and then for the day.The Opposition alleged that the government had run away from a proper debate. Former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said, We (the Opposition) condemn the presiding officers conduct. Once the government became aware that it would stand exposed, it ran away from a debate. It tried to muzzle the Oppositions voice with the help of the presiding officer.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe CM had begun his speech with the defence of Tribal Development Minister Vishnu Sawra in the controversy over purchase of raincoats for tribal children. While accepting there had been certain irregularities in the purchase process, the CM appeared to blame it on the contractor nexus functioning in the Tribal Development department over the last 15 years, while saying that Sawra hadnt made a single mistake in the matter. Next he came out in defence of Shiv Senas Minister of State (Housing) Ravindra Waikar. Waikar is facing accusations over constructing an illegal gymnasium floor on a public land in Aarey using MLA funds.Fadnavis named similar illegalities in development works carried out by Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam and Congress legislator Ashok Jagtap.Further, while accepting that Sambhaji Nilengekar Patil had been chargesheeted by the CBI in an alleged loan fraud where he had stood guarantor by mortgaging a land, Fadnavis said that the entire matter was borne out of a family and political feud. The complainant in the matter is his grandfather (Shivajirao Nilengekar Patil, a former CM). It is of a political nature.Similarly, he said that criminal proceedings initiated against another minister Jaikumar Rawal in a loan scandal, which took place during the previous regime, were also politically motivated. His defence was on the same lines for BJPs Minister of State Ravindra Chavan, who faces 19 cases including those of extortion and kidnapping.In the Take Home Ration controversy involving Pankaja Munde, CM said that the accusations had been levelled without proper reading of a court judgement in this regard. On allegations of financial irregularities in the Beed District Cooperative whose 15 directors (out of 17) are from the BJP, he said, The irregularities mainly deal with loans provided to firms promoted by Amarsingh Pandit, Dhananjay Munde, Jaydutt Kshirsagar (all NCP) and Ashok Patil (Congress).While admitting that BJPs Girish Mahajan had erred by not naming a farm land procured in his name as a director in a private sugar mill in his election affidavit, the CM said that the minister had returned the land. He also came out in defence of BJPs Ram Shinde and Pandurang Phundkar, and Shiv Senas Diwakar Raote.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express photo) Arms Factory where police Recovered huge-arms at Burir Math Kankhuli Rabindranagar Maheshtala. (Source: Express photo)A NON-DESCRIPT single-storey house in Maheshtala area of South-24 Paraganas  around 20 to 25 km from Kolkata  has been the talk of the town since Tuesday night.Its resident Aftab Hussain, a tailor and a grocery shopowner at Kankhuli in Rabindranagar, was arrested along with four associates on Tuesday for operating an illegal arms factory in the house. Locals have claimed they had no idea that Aftab was actually running an illegal arms factory behind the garb of the tailoring and grocery shops, said police.While three of the accused, Mohammed Aslam, Mohammed Ahtesan and Salim, hailed from Munger in Bihar, Nizam Purkait is a resident of Basanti in South-24 Parganas. Kingpin Aftab hailed from Bihars Bhagalpur area.Many are referring to the house as a mini Munger since Tuesday, said a police officer. In 2003, police had recovered a large number of arms and ammunition, and had unearthed several minigun factories in Munger district of Bihar.Aftab had reportedly bought the house around a year ago. Sources said it was in Bihar that he mastered arms dealing. After the death of his wife, Aftab, who used to visit Bengal often, decided to shift here. May be he was not making as much profit as he wanted. Hence, he established his own factory It was like a whole arms factory was shifted from Munger to Bengal, said a police officer.He settled down in Rabindra Nagar, a prominent Muslim locality, with his three sons and a daughter. He first opened a grocery shop in front of his house, and later started a tailoring shop from his house. Locals said his daughter mostly dealt with customers, he added. The children were not directly involved in Aftabs illegal arms business, police said.Locals have claimed that to suppress the sound produced by welding machines while manufacturing arms, Aftab used to play music or continuously operate sewing machines.Selim and Nizam sold the arms manufactured by Aslam and Ahtesan, South-24 Paraganas SP Sunil Kumar Choudhury said.A minimum of Rs 1,000 was charged for a shutter or a pistol. They have supplied arms to South-24 Paraganas, North-24 Parganas and in Port area of Kolkata. We are investigating if Aftab was linked to any specific group, said Choudhury. Sources said the group initially sold arms to petty criminals, who use countrymade weapons. These were ferried in sugar bags and clothes.The preferred route to supply materials to be used in manufacturing of arms from Munger to Bengal was via Girdi, Asansol, Howrah, Hoogly and then to South-24 Paraganas, said police.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
