Express photo by Praveen Khanna Sugarcane fields in Shamli. Express photo by Praveen KhannaFor many, there may be no apparent connection between crop prices and private school enrolments, but for those in this primarily sugarcane-growing district of western Uttar Pradesh, the link is obvious.Shamli saw a mushrooming of private English-medium schools with Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliation during the period from 2007-08 to 2012-13, when the Uttar Pradesh government raised its State Advised Price (SAP) for sugarcane from Rs 125 to Rs 280 per quintal. The number of such schools trebled from eight to 24, out of which 12 were in Shamli itself and the rest in smaller towns of the district, like Thanabhawan, Jhinjhana, Unn, Jalalabad, Kairana and Kandhla.These schools are now facing a financial crisis, with the cane SAP remaining unchanged since the 2012-13 sugar season and mills unable to pay even this to farmers. Suryavir Singh, the chairman of the co-educational CBSE-affiliated B.S.M School in Shamli, claims that every private school in the district is saddled with outstanding fee dues, ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.Watch Video: Whats making newsThis is largely a rural belt whose economy is based on sugarcane. At least 70 per cent of the students are from villages in and around Shamli. When farmers dont get paid, we are also affected, says Singh, whose own school has fees-cum-transport charge arrears of Rs 42.5 lakh.According to him, during the boom period when farmers had money and were willing to spend on education for their children, each school was adding 100-200 students every year. But in the last three years, around 50-100 children have been dropping out annually and going back to studying in the government school at their villages.Shamli has 76,500-odd farming families who supplied 193.11 lakh quintals of cane to the districts three sugar mills during the recent 2015-16 season. While this cane was worth Rs 538.46 crore at the SAP of Rs 280/quintal, farmers have so far got only Rs 247.02 crore. Not receiving timely payments, which has been a common feature all through the last three years, has severely hit their spending power.We cannot force farmers to pay, as their financial condition has really deteriorated, says Yogendra Malik, manager of Maharaja Surajmal Public School, which is 6 km from Shamli town and has around 700 students, from nursery to Class XII.This school, run by the Delhi-based Surajmal Memorial Education Society and catering largely to the Jat community, currently has fee arrears of Rs 26.5 lakh, pending since April. We also incur annual loss of Rs 8-9 lakh towards transport, as most of our students come from interior areas who cannot afford to pay full charge, Malik adds.Private schools in Shamli charge monthly fees ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000, apart from Rs 500-600 as conveyance charge. Most schools have between 500 and 2,500 students, though in some the numbers are now falling below the minimum 500 or so for them to remain viable.Mohkam Singh from Kheri Bairagi village, who owns 3-acres of land, supplied 400 quintals of cane to the local sugar mill at Shamli in 2015-16. While this cane should have fetched Rs 1.12 lakh at the SAP, all he has got so far is Rs 44,000. His two grandchildren study at Devi Umra Kaur Vedic School, which is 5 km from the village. Their combined monthly fee of Rs 3,000, inclusive of bus charges, has not been paid after March and Singh isnt sure how long the school will keep them.But why are farmers keen to send their children to private schools? The government schools teach neither English nor any computer courses. Even the quality of teachers has come down and the schools dont have proper furniture or electricity most of the time. How will our children compete without the minimum facilities and standards that private schools are offering? says Kaliram Chauhan, who farms 6 acres at Rasoolpur Gujran in Kandhla tehsil.He, too, is awaiting full payment for his 900 quintals of cane delivered to the Shamli mill.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5941a38c7be9e0192d33ae4c,Agriculture Reform: Breaking the traderÂ cartel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/agriculture-reform-breaking-the-trader-cartel-2855435/,2016-06-16,"The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar) The Vashi mandi, situated 35 km from the Mumbai main city. (Express Photo: Narendra Vaskar)Spread over 70 hectares land off the Old Mumbai-Pune highway, its a place where more than Rs 10,000 crore worth of fruits, vegetables and other farm produce gets traded annually. But right now, its also the scene of a prabodhan, a mass awakening campaign by traders and commission agents that could gather pace in the days ahead.The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) at Vashi, barely 35 km from the main Mumbai city, is one of Maharashtras 305 regulated mandis where produce is first traded before being taken for consumption elsewhere. While the smallest of these may have a yearly turnover of below Rs 25 lakh, the Vashi APMC is the largest and also a terminal market receiving daily over 2,000 trucks that ferry produce from both within and outside Maharashtra. Last year alone, this mandi saw arrivals of 8,93,444 tonnes of onions and potatoes, 5,64,056 tonnes of other vegetables and 6,63,831 tonnes of fruits.Currently, though, a single factor is uniting the market players operating in regulated mandis across Maharashtra irrespective of size: The state governments move to delist fruits and vegetables (F&V) from the purview of the APMC Act. This, if it happens as was done by the Delhi government in September 2014, would dispense with the requirement for all F&V to be brought to mandis and sold through licensed market agents charging commission fees. Such fees in the Vashi APMC amount to 6.5 per cent of the purchase price of onions and potatoes, 8 per cent for other vegetables and 10 per cent for fruits.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe notification delisting F&V will be issued in the next few days. The issue has been pending since long and we have decided to go ahead taking into account the interest of farmers, said Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtras minister for cooperation.This isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview. A final decision, however, could not be taken following strong trader protests.The possibility of the reform going through is seen to be higher under the present BJP-Shiv Sena dispensation. A major reason for it is that the APMCs  like sugar and various other rural-based cooperatives  are largely controlled by the NCP and Congress. The ruling alliance partners have little presence in APMC boards that are supposed to have elected directors representing all stakeholders, including farmers, traders and mandi labourers. The Vashi APMC is now under a state government-appointed administrator, with the earlier board of directors superseded for alleged malpractices.The total turnover of APMCs in Maharashtra is roughly Rs 50,000 crore. Delisting of F&V may bring this down by Rs 10,000 crore. But even this neednt be the case, as we have seen in Delhi, where business at Azadpur mandi has not suffered after delisting. We are only giving farmers an option, which includes supplying directly to processors or supermarkets. Theres nothing stopping them from continuing to sell through APMCs, pointed out Patil.F&V contribute over Rs 3,000 crore to the Vashi APMCs yearly turnover of Rs 10,000-12,000 crore.APMCs were originally established with a view to prevent exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, who compelled them to dispose of their produce at the farmgate at very low prices. By mandating all farm produce to be brought to regulated market yards and sold through auctions, the APMC mechanism was meant to ensure fair prices to farmers. But in many cases, these bodies have themselves become dens for cartelisation by traders, who control prices and charge hefty commission fees on produce transactions.An extreme case that surfaced recently was of Devidas Maruti Parbhane. This farmer from Vadgaon Rasai, a village in Pune districts Shirur taluka, supplied one tonne of onions early this month at the local market yard under the Pune APMCs jurisdiction. The price he got  a little more than Rs 1.5 per kg  was itself very low. But adding insult to injury was the various cuts imposed on top of this.A scrutiny of Parbhanes patti (trade slip) by The Indian Express revealed his total revenues from the sale of one tonne of onions at Rs 1,523.20. The total cuts even on this meager amount added up to Rs 1,522.20. That included commission fees of Rs 91.30, hamali or labour charges of Rs 59, bharai or filling-in-bags charges of Rs 18.55, tolai or loading charges of Rs 33.30, and transport charges of Rs 1,320 (as the kutcha patti issued in Shirur was billed for delivery at Pune). Parbhane, at the end of it, was left with a net earning of Re 1: When after the auction, the trader handed me a Re 1 coin, I was flabbergasted. Maybe, he should not have taken the trouble to pay me even that!Traders, however, dismiss these as one-off incidents, while claiming that delisting of F&V would ultimately hurt even farmers. The produce brought by farmers is not uniform, which is what processors want. The APMCs are tuned to handle variety. Here, we have 50-55 varieties of vegetables and 25-30 varieties of fruits arriving on a daily basis. Such variety will disappear once delisting happens. Moreover, instead of a centralised marketplace, youll have small and medium vehicles carrying farm produce and creating traffic mayhem in Mumbai, warned Rajendra Shelke, a leading onion and potato commission agent at the Vashi APMC.Besides, the APMC system guarantees that the farmer is paid for his produce, which wouldnt be the case if he were to sell directly? The proposed reform looks good on paper, but it will only spell doom for the farmer and end up completely destroying the agrarian economy, he added.Sanjay Pansare, who represents traders at the Vashi APMCs fruit market, justified the high commission rates on grounds that the goods being handled here were perishable and prone to quality deterioration. Only around a quarter of the produce brought to the market is eventually of the best quality; the rest falls between medium and bad. The losses borne by traders on this count have to, therefore, be made up through higher commission fees. Since 2002, the Maharashtra government has been issuing marketing licenses to various entities for procuring directly from the farmgate. Besides, 34 private markets have been allowed to be set up. But despite this, an estimated 75 per cent of annual arrivals of F&V in the state still take place in APMCs. The proportions are lower at 46 per cent for cotton and 25-30 per cent in oilseeds and foodgrains.Delisting F&V from the purview of the APMC ActThis isnt the first attempt at a significant agricultural marketing reform. In 2012, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, who was agriculture minister in the previous Congress-NCP regime, had announced the intent at delisting horticultural produce from the state APMC Acts purview.
