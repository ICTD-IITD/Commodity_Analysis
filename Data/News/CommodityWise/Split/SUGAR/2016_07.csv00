However, their margins expanded on benign input costs.This July-September quarter, sales growth for companies was lowest in almost a decade. Hindustan Unilevers revenue in the second quarter rose just 2%.While, the companies were hoping for a recovery in the second half of this year, the demonetisation has reduced demand further, particularly in wholesale channels, which drive almost 40% of FMCG business. The cost of raw materials has also inched up following a rise in global crude prices.According to Nielsen, consumer sales declined 1.8% in November versus October, while retailer purchase from trade fell 6.4%. The overall FMCG industry is estimated to be worth 2.56 lakh crore, so in absolute terms, the drop was huge, it said.Despite Diwali-related spends, there is an indication of lost velocity in FMCG. More importantly, we see retailer purchases declining faster than consumer sales, Nielsen said.Impulse foods and personal care products are among the most affected in terms of consumer offtake.The consumer is clearly moving into more daily necessities. ...The fact is that the consumer has got limited cash outlays ... said P Balaji, CFO, Hindustan Unilever, the largest FMCG player in the country.He also said the wholesale sector was among the most affected and so the company would focus on increasing its direct coverage of retail outlets.Religare Securities has cut its sales estimates on companies across the FMCG sector by 1.1%-7.5% for the current financial year, while profit estimates have been slashed by 3.2%-18.6%.Over the last few months, the price of key raw materials is on the rise.For instance, palm oil (key input in soaps) is up 48% year-on-year, wheat 24%, rice bran 16% and sugar 31%."

While the circulars released by UGC are not binding, affiliated universities and colleges are expected to follow the prescribed rules.The circular even suggests ways the institutes can implement the order.While the circular does not define junk food, circulars by other boards of education, including the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, refer to junk food as items that are high on calories, but low on nutrients.For starters, colleges have been asked to display information on markers such as body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, etc. Orientation programmes have been recommended for staff as well as students so as to put across the point to the youth as soon as possible. Students too have been asked to form clusters among themselves and counsel each other about proper nutrition, exercise as well as other healthy habits.Some students, however, found this circular amusing.In this day and age, almost everyone is aware of the perils of consuming junk food, especially after being told about all through school. We are not school kids anymore to follow such strict rules, said Ankita Parekh, a student from Bandras RD National College.The more the restrictions, the higher the chances that well do the exact opposite. If we dont find our food in the canteen, students will opt for smaller joints outside the college which will not even be clean. At least our canteen serves clean food, said Sachit Ramesh, a student of Mithibai College, Vile Parle.While colleges have given a thumbs-up to the initiative, many thought banning junk food will not help much. Creating awareness about healthy eating is something all colleges can easily adopt, and this can help students understand the problem. Unless students practice self-restraint , simply banning something will not help the cause, said Vijay Joshi, principal of K J Somaiya College, Vidya Vihar.What colleges will have to do Implement measures to sensitise students on ill effects of junk food Universities can serve as important data sources on students health. Information on markers like body mass index (BMI)/percentage of body weight/waist hip ratio, etc can help create awareness among students towards their health. BMI is the approximate measure of whether an individual is overweight or underweight, calculated by dividing their weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres Conduct orientation programs for faculty and staff on health issues Create wellness clusters under the Students Welfare Department to counsel students about proper nutrition, proper exercise and healthy habits. These wellness clusters can also provide psychological support to the students to prevent and reduce the incidence of obesity in young studentsSimilar incidents In January this year, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) directed all affiliated schools to take junk food off their canteen menu. Schools were also asked to inspect lunch boxes of students, create awareness about nutritious food and regularly monitor students health. The circular was released following a report by the Ministry of Women and Child Development addressing consumption of foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar (HFSS) and promotion of healthy snacks in schools In May 2012, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had directed all schools to ban junk food and carbonated drinks, calling them rich in calories but deficient in vital nutrients. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations in May 2012 and all schools were asked to implement this ban at the earliest"

After the state government fixed the state advised price (SAP) for sugarcane at Rs 300 per quintal, which is Rs 26 less than what the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, had recommended, the farmers allege the prices are being controlled by mill owners.The SAP hike as compared to last year is mere Rs 5 per quintal. In comparison to Rs 295 per quintal offered by the Punjab government last year, the neighbouring state of Haryana had offered Rs 311 to its cane growers.Farmers blame the lobby of sugar mill owners for the poor remuneration. Why is the government not fixing prices on a par with Haryana, when the input cost, weather and varieties grown in Haryana are the same as in Punjab? questioned Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).The mill owners, who are part of the government, dont want farmers to earn anything and want to keep their profits intact... By depriving sugarcane growers of additional Rs 10 per quintal, the government has caused them a loss of Rs 67 crore, he said.I used to grow sugarcane over 40 acre ithin a few years, the area reduced to just one acre, because prices are not in proportion to the input cost . Sukhwinder Singh Dhillon, farmer, Bhattian, LudhianaJarnail Singh Wahid, who is the managing director of Markfed since 2008 and is contesting the forthcoming polls from Nawanshahr, is part of the SAP fixation committee. He also happens to own a sugarcane mill in Phagwara. How can we expect good returns for our produce, when mill owners play a key role in deciding the prices? questioned a farmer, requesting anonymity.A member of the SAP fixation committee, on the condition of anonymity, said Wahid exerted pressure on other members to support him on a reasonable hike in the SAP.Giving justification for the decision, Wahid, who is also the Punjab sugar mill owners association president, told HT that privately owned sugar mill suffered a loss of Rs 200 crore to Rs 300 crore each last season.We want to recover our losses and stay in the business. In case our mills shut down, who will process the sugarcane produced by the farmers? Jarnail Singh Wahid, SAP fixation panel member, Akali leader and mill ownerWe want to recover our losses and stay in the business. In case our mills shut down, who will process the sugarcane produced by the farmers? They (farmers) should understand this. An SAP in excess of 300 per quintal was not feasible, he said in a reply to the HTs query, while he was campaigning in Nawanshahr.Kamal Oswal, who owns a sugar mill in Amloh and is an adviser to the Punjab chief minister, is also being targeted by farmers for not letting a hike in the SAP. Oswal and Punjab agriculture minister Tota Singh, who heads the sugarcane SAP fixation committee, were not available for comments.Out of 16 sugar mills in Punjab, nine are in cooperative sector, while seven are privately owned. Seven other mills have already shut down in the state. Last year, the government supported private mills by paying Rs 223 crore to farmers from the state exchequer.I will also like to see more remuneration for the farmers. Even the 5 hike in the SAP was done after much persuasion, agriculture director JS Bains told HT. Bains said the SAP fixation committee members also took the plea that the fair remunerative price (FRP) fixed by the Centre was Rs 230 per quintal, much less than the SAP.The total sugarcane production in the state is expected to touch 68 lakh tonne this season. A decade ago, sugarcane was grown over 7 lakh hectare. Much to the dismay of experts, the area has shrunk to 1 lakh hectare, taking a toll on diversification."

He has tuberculosis and is too ill to continue working as a labourer.As his wife Ramkumari, 35, now supports the family by going to the forest to forage for fruits, roots and honey to sell, Banbaris job is to stay home with his five other children and newborn grandchild. When her mother died, there was no one to feed her.In desperation, Banbari even considered giving away the little baby to another family, but then she fell ill. I tried, but I did not know how to look after the baby, he says. Admitting the baby to the SNCU (special new born care unit) at the district hospital in Shivpuri could not save her life.Jasoda and her daughter arent the only ones. Each year, 55,000 women die in India from preventable pregnancy-related causes. In most cases, infections and disease are compounded by chronic hunger and malnutrition  and a lack of access to affordable pre-birth healthcare services because of corruption or caste bias.Read | Children of hunger: Wasted young lives in the heart of IndiaThe maternal mortality rate (MMR) -- deaths per 100,000 live births -- fell from 212 in 2007 to 167 in 2013 but too many women are dying still.And as the maternal death rates remain the highest in the populous states of Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the total number of women dying is also high.To tackle this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan two weeks ago to provide free antenatal  before childbirth - care to pregnant women on the 9th of every month at government health centres and hospitals across Indias 687 districts.Building on the National Health Missions flagship Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), all pregnant women must be given a physical and abdominal examination, a tetanus shot and 100 iron-folic acid tablets.They must also be tested for anaemia, high blood pressure, high blood sugar (gestational diabetes) and other problems linked with pregnancy to lower Indias MMR and infant mortality rate (deaths of children under five years of age per 1,000 live births).Motherless childWomen in the lowest socio-economic sections in India are two-and-a-half times more likely to die of childbirth, largely because they dont get the medical support they need to deliver a healthy baby. Jasodas death is a case in point.Maternal deaths are not just about a woman dying, it also adversely affects the health of newborn and surviving children, who get trapped in a vicious cycle of malnutrition, stunting and wasting, says Ajay Yadav, founder of the NGO Badlav (Change), who has been working on health and nutrition in Madhya Pradesh.Incomplete antental care also lowers the chances of the mothers and childs survival. Malti Adivasi, 19, wife of Ram Lakhan, 25, lost her nine-month-old daughter Lakshmi to malnutrition earlier this year. She had delivered in a hospital but was not given iron-and-folic acid tablets or advice on feeding her baby after delivery. Lakshmi was given the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis and polio vaccine at birth, after which she got no vaccinations.Malnutrition begins after six months when the baby needs additional nutrition, which the mother is not able to provide. Thats when weight drops and wasting sets in, making the baby susceptible to infections such as pneumonia and diarrhoea, said Pramod Tiwari from the Manav Foundation, Sheopur.State of careFrequent infections aggravate chronic hunger with most severe acute malnutrition deaths taking place between nine months and five years.Apart from saving mothers, antenatal care and institutional deliveries boost chances of newborn survival. The mother gets a tetanus toxoid shot to lower risk of infection during delivery, iron and folic acid to boost blood haemoglobin levels, and nutritional advice on feeding the newborn within the first hour of birth.Breast milk contains all the nutrients a baby needs in the first six months of life and nursing a newborn within one hour of birth delivers highly nutritious colostrum (first milk) that protects against common childhood infections such as diarrhoea and pneumonia and boosts mental and physical development.Under the JSY, all services for the mother and her newborn are free and incentives are given to families to opt for institutional deliveries, yet corruption and apathy in the public health system make the poor hesitant in accepting services.Hospital staff sometimes demand a bribe up to Rs 500 for a delivery because they know mothers get Rs 1,400 for an institutional delivery. But since that money is transferred directly to the parents bank account, villagers have no money to give hospital and clinic and so they opt for home deliveries, says Yadav.Caste plays a role in the exclusion from health services, with marginalised tribes like the Saharias losing out both nutritionally, socially and economically, says Yadav. Unless delivery becomes inclusive, children will continue to be orphaned.Case study: Halki Adivasi, 25Halki Adivasi delivered a baby boy last month and grieved for her 18-month-old baby girl Parvati three weeks later.Three of her six children died between the ages of six months and one year over the past five years and now she lives in her one-room mud and thatch hut with her newborn, her husband Vishnu, 30, and two surviving children, son Radhay Shyam,8, and daughter Anjani, 7.Halkis baby boy Anand was born at home at 2 am but the umbilical cord was cut eight hours later because her husband Vishnu Adivasi, 30, could not get a midwife. She has three babies and has lost another three to malnutrition in Bhairopura village in Madhya Pradeshs Shivpuri district. (Virendra Singh Gosain/Hindustan Times)The family is clueless about what killed their children. They fell ill and died, is all he knows.None of the children have ever been vaccinated, including her month-old son Anand.Since no government health worker has ever visited their home, Halki missed all three of the antenatal screening benefits she is supposed to get free under the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) for mother and newborn health.Halki delivered at home at 2am the day before dushherra and lay with her baby with the umbilical cord attached all night till a birthing assistant reached her the next morning at 11 am and cut the cord.I went looking for a midwife at night but she couldnt come till the next morning, so we had to wait, said her husband Vishnu Adivasi, 30, who works as a daily labourer.Like it happened to many other women living in Bhairopura village in Madhya Pradeshs Shivpuri district, Halkis pregnancy slipped between the cracks and she did not get iron and folic acid supplementation and tetanus toxoid vaccination. The family will also not get the Rs 1,400 given to every mother who delivers in a government institution.Read | Wracked from within: In tribal Madhya Pradesh, TB continues to kill"

Cases of malaria have so far been negligible this season.Last year, the city recorded 201 malaria cases. In comparison, only 33 cases have been registered this year, of which 19 were registered this month, the health department said.Doctors at Fortis Memorial Research Institute said cases of patients showcasing symptoms of malaria such as high fever with excessive shivering and body rashes are on the rise this month.The number of malaria cases is significantly lower than last year. But, there has been a sudden increase in the number of patients displaying Malaria symptoms, Dr Raman Abhi, additional director of internal medicine at FMRI, said.Medical examination of the condition shows spleen enlargement and reduction in blood sugar and haemoglobin. In the country, there are usually two types of malaria strains  Vivax and Falciform.

People on both sides of the road jostled to shake hands with the leader, who did not disappoint them, despite objections from his security team.He also accepted a memorandum from the people and gave a cursory glance at it before handing it over to the SPG personnel sitting next to him.As the cavalcade reached Jawaharlal Nehru Chowk, Rahul got down from the SUV to pay a floral tribute to his great-grandfather and first Prime Minister of India, Jawahar Lal Nehru. Basti is probably the only city in the country which has the statue of Jawahar Lal Nehru riding a horse. Rahul placed a garland on the platform.As the road show reached Subhash Chowk, also known as Kutchery crossing, Gandhi once again came out of his vehicle to pay tribute to Subhas Chandra Bose.Local Congressmen informed Rahul about a statue of Mahatma Gandhi just a few metres away and the Congress vice-president walked down to the spot to pay respect to the father of the nation.Meanwhile, at Gonda, Rahul Gandhi assured farmers that all closed sugar mills of the region would be restarted and all pending dues would be cleared if his party formed the next government in UP.

More than four in five diabetics on medication in India do not have their blood glucose under control .The new study, of more than 1,100 patients across 10 centres  nine in India and one in Karachi, Pakistan  over five years and published in Annals of Internal Medicine, is the first global trial of diabetes management in low- and middle-income countries, home to 75% of the worlds 415 million diabetics.The study found that non-physician coordinators with technology that welded electronic health records with decision-support software sizeably improved blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol profiles of patients and lowered risk of complications such as heart disease, eye disease (retinopathy), kidney failure and amputations.What makes this model workable is the low dependence on physicians, who are often few and far between, especially in rural areas. Any graduate or social worker with six or more months of experience in healthcare, social work or allied sciences and basic computing and good communication skills meets the requirement for a care coordinator, who then gets trained for 2.5 days to get acquainted with key principles of diabetes management, said Dr Nikhil Tandon, head of endocrinology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which partnered with the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and Emory University, Atlanta, US, to do this real life study of patients getting treated for diabetes in public and private clinics and hospitals.No new or expensive drugs were added as the intervention is based on improved data-management and human intervention. It enhances the patients skills of managing their disease on their own by providing individualised support and making the physician more responsive by making better data available, says Dr D. Prabhakaran, vice president, research and policy, PHFI.The outcomes were similar across public and private hospitals and the model has been replicated using the public-health resources. Auxillary nurse midwives at community health centres in Solan in Himachal Pradesh have used the intervention with excellent results, which shows it is translatable on a larger scale and at different levels of health care, says Dr Tandon.The decision-support software is free for public health facilities and will have a nominal charge for private clinics and users, says Dr Prabhakaran.Sugar-coated Trouble415 million people with diabetes worldwide75% adults with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countriesClose to one in two (46%) people with diabetes are undiagnosedDiabetes kills 5 million annually, one death every six secondsMore than 542,000 children with type 1 diabetesOne in seven births -- More 20.9 million worldwide -- affected by diabetes during pregnancyHealth expenditure of US$ 673 billion dollars in 2015India stats70 million in IndiaOne in 12 adults have diabetes80% patients with poorly controlled blood glucose (an HbA1c > 7%)30-50% diabetics with uncontrolled blood pressure and cholesterolSource: International Diabetes Federation Diabetes Atlas, 2015Lowering riskStay active.

Bhujbals counsel has been arguing that he is suffering from various ailments.His counsel had told the court that he has already undergone an angioplasty, suffered from asthma and sleep apnea, had dietary restrictions and his blood sugar levels have to be monitored constantly. The ED opposed the bail plea saying his health condition is been taken care of. Enforcement Directorate (ED) lawyer Poornima Kantharia said Bhujbal was very actively involved in routine activities. The bail should be rejected as he is keeping fine. The chief medical officer is monitoring his health in the evening and morning. He was also admitted and has been subjected to all kinds of tests. The reports are out on whatever complaints he had made and all possible treatment has been given, she argued.The lawyer, while elaborating on Bhujbals ailments, said, Asthma is not a major ailment and every night he is provided a machine [CP/AP machine, a small machine that supplies a constant and steady air pressure] for sleep apnea. The angioplasty was done 13 years ago and his utmost care is being taken. All care is taken, including that of the heart. The exercises [advised by doctors] can be done in jail as well.Meanwhile, the ED on Wednesday submitted an application before the court seeking extension of time to execute the non-bailable warrants (NBW) issued against 29 accused in the case. ED sources stated they are still on the lookout for the accused and hence sought more time. Many accused have approached the court while appealing to squash the NBW issued against them.The ED, which has filed a criminal complaint in the special PMLA court against 53 people, has so far arrested three accused in the case  Chhagan, his nephew Sameer and their chartered accountant Sunil Naik. While an NBW has been issued against 30 people, only Naik was arrested and has been granted bail."

The plot already had 13 industrial units set up decades ago on 99-year leases from the MIDC. In a formal complaint to the Pune police on Monday, one Hemant Gawande alleged the land was purchased by the minister to claim compensation of up to Rs100 crore under the new Land Ceiling Act.Desais claim that the land belongs to the MIDC puts Khadse in a spot even more.An irked Khadse countered the claim: In a letter to the industries department by the then MIDC CEO Bhushan Gagarani in 2012, it has been mentioned that the land does not belong to them as the sale was not completed in 1969. The letter has also mentioned that the owner of the land Abbas Ukani has been fighting for compensation for the last 45 years. Desai had not studied the case before issuing the statement, Khadse said.An MIDC official said the land deal was sound on legal grounds, but the issues of conflict of interest and quid pro quo remained. The official pointed out that the land was purchased though the compensation case was in the High Court, and that compensation to the owner would range between Rs40 crore and Rs70 crore depending on which Act was applied.Khadse, however, told HT: The land was purchased by paying the stamp duty and registration fee for the ready reckoner price of the land which was Rs23 crore. The owner of the land has given it to me in writing that Rs3.72 crore was the settlement price between us and him as he was not able to pursue the matter in the high court because he was aged and lived in far-off Kolkata.When Khadse met Fadnavis for more than an hour, he reportedly explained the entire issue to him and requested the CM to ensure that a formal FIR was not registered on Gawandes complaint. Khadse, however, told the media that the meeting was to discuss the elctions to the legislative council and the Rajya Sabha. He also insisted that the reports of him losing the revenue portfolio were baseless.In a related development, a Congress delegation led by city unit president Sanjay Nirupam met Governor C Vidyasagar Rao and demanded that Khadse should be sacked.In the evening, Damania, a former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader instrumental in exposing both the irrigation and the Maharashtra Sadan scams, alleged that Khadse had links with large-scale irregularities in the Tapi irrigation project. She also alleged that Khadses family members were directors of a sugar factory purchased by two irrigation contractors. Khadse, however, described the allegation as baseless. I was not even the irrigation minister when these contracts were awarded and hence there is no question of me favouring anyone, he said.Damania has threated to start a dharna agitation outside Fadnavis residence if action is not taken against Khadse.Meanwhile, Desais statement could escalate the war between the BJP and the Sena. The party high command has backed Desai to settle scores with Khadse who played a key role in snapping the 25-year-old ties between the two parties ahead of the Assembly election in 2014, a Sena leader said on the condition of anonymity."

India is the worlds second-largest producer of the sweetener and also the biggest consumer. Cotton production has already dipped 10%, figures for April show.Sugar output has been hit the hardest in Maharashtra and Karnataka, two states worst-affected by drought. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, over 35 million farmers grow cane, making up 7% of the rural population.A 14% deficient monsoon has caused a severe drought in 256 of the countrys 640 districts, or about 40% of the country, stoking a challenging rural distress for the Modi government.The agriculture ministry expects a slightly higher pulses output of 17.33 million tonnes in 2015-16, compared with the previous years 17.15 million tonnes, but it is still short of the 27 million tonnes needed. The gap is mostly met through costly imports, which keep prices high.In February, retail pulses prices rose 37%, in contrast to wholesale prices falling for the 17th month in a row in March. Contradicting the governments projections, Ajay Saraf, an analyst with the firm ComTrade, said: We expect pulses output to be lower than last years.The food ministry had asked states to submit their expected pulses demand. On Thursday, the government decided to distribute 10,000 tonnes to states from a 55-lakh tonne newly-created reserve, anticipating shortages. The government has also asked state authorities to monitor price movements.Estimates of the Indian Sugar Mills Association show output between October last year and April 15 stood at 24.3 million tonne, about 2 million tonne short than the 26.4 million tonne during the previous years corresponding period. ICRA, an investment firm, foresees a steeper sugar shortfall of 10% in 2016, the firm said in a review.In 2015-16, the countrys cotton output stood at 34.1 million bales of cotton (of 170kg each), against 38.2 million bales, according to data from the Cotton Association of India."

Not so much in its meteorological technicalities as in our reaction to it. There were times when we would be sturdy enough to play cricket in 40C without batting an eyelid (pun unintended). These days we rush to air-conditioned comfort zones when the sun is only half as punishing. In this era of baggy bermudas, colourful flip flops, mint mojitos, gelato ice-cream, frozen yoghurts, IPL, getaway vacations, and wellness resorts, the urban Indian has the wherewithal and the capacity to beat the heat in numerous ways.Folks from rural India still brave the ferocity of the season with limited means though. Thatched roofs, cool lassi, old-fashioned coolers and creaky fans make up their defence against the onslaught of the sun. Be that as it may, village residents stay healthier on the whole than their city-based brethren. We have all become, pardon me, rather namby-pamby.Thus the perceived need to sleep in the AC, cook in the AC, and even bathe in the AC! An affinity for air-conditioning appears to have inflicted the people of our country, to the point of overdoing it. Few can brave the adversity of a hot summer afternoon these days without the aid of modern-day technology. AC dehydrates our bodies and leaves us feeling weak and lethargic. The need to sweat a little during the afternoons and make do with just a fan at night is perhaps what the doctor should order.In some countries, there is a dictum that advises offices to keep the temperature at 24 degrees indoors. Men are permitted to not wear ties and remain comfortable. Here, we often try to get the cooling down to 18 degrees, especially in public spaces such as hotels and trains. And then we complain when we fall sick as a result of being exposed to 42 degrees on stepping outdoors.The need to roll down the car windows before switching on the AC in the mornings has been oft extolled but is still observed in the breach by some, to their potential peril. Some of us grew up at a time when car AC or any AC was unheard of. Straw hats, hand fans, kurta-pyjamas, rooftop charpoys, pedestal fans, and mosquito nets were still around. Road-rage was certainly less prevalent.Nowadays people have a really short fuse, especially in the summers it seems. Cool and calm minds are rarities. As are polite car users. But summers are also about invigorating morning walks, outdoor chats long into a balmy night, juicy gossip, and juicy fruits of all sorts, led of course by the emperor of emperors, the mango. Those men and women who have not partaken of mangoes in the confines of their homes, in a half-clad state, have hardly lived. And to those who avoid mangoes since they are fattening supposedly, I say humbly that they should avoid that spoon-full of sugar in their tea, avoid all toffees, chocolates, ice-creams, and even rice if they have to, but let us keep up the tradition of abiding love for the most succulent of Gods creations.Summer romances are short-lived. Mango deserts us by mid-August and melon even before that. So lets relish the taste of the season, and keep our cool, come what may. Summer time is fun time. Enjoy the season folks!vivek.atray@gmail.com(The writer is an administrator, author, and motivational speaker)"

He was lodged at the Arthur Road jail, after which he was remanded in judicial custody.We have ordered an inquiry into the incident and are looking into the reasons for his admission to the hospital, said Bipin Kumar Singh, inspector general of prisons.Dr Jagdish Bhawani, medical superintendent of the hospital, said, The reference letter from Dr Rahul Ghule from jail mentions St George Hospital/ Goverment Dental College. We treated him because the physician confirmed he needed admission.Doctors said Bhujbal is in the ICU and is under observation.Hospital sources said Bhujbals blood pressure was high (180/120) when he was admitted.His counsel had earlier told the court he has undergone an angioplasty, suffers from asthma, sleep apnea, has dietary restrictions and his blood sugar levels need to be monitored regularly. Both the ED and the anti-corruption bureau have filed charge sheets in the case.Before the senior leaders arrest, the ED had arrested his nephew Sameer. According to allegations in the case, which is being jointly investigated by the ED and the state anti-corruption bureau, the contract for redevelopment of the state guesthouse in New Delhi, Maharashtra Sadan, was not advertised and the contractor gave the sub-contract to companies owned by the Bhujbal family.A private developer was allowed to carry out the makeover of the Sadan and the Andheri RTO in lieu for FSI for a slum rehabilitation project in Andheri. In the Kalina deal, Bhujbal and five others have been accused of allegedly causing huge losses to the state exchequer by illegally leasing a prime plot at Kalina in Santacruz (East) to a private developer."

The addition of the 938 will take the total number of drought-affected villages to 29,700, including 1,991 that grow rabi crops.According to a source in the government, the 938 villages are in Solapur and Ahmednagar districts. Crops that are grown during the monsoon season are called kharif crops while those grown during the winter season (October-March) are called rabi crops.Read: Maha drought: Drinking water situation worsensRevenue minister Eknath Khadse said on Thursday that villages with rabi crops have also been affected by the drought this time, and that based on fresh reports from districts, more villages will be declared drought-affected soon. He, however, did not disclosed exactly how many.The state government also reviewed preparations for the kharif season at a meeting chaired by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday.After the meeting, Khadse said that this year, crops will be sown on around 1.50 lakh hectares of land and that the government expects a total crop production of around 1.62 lakh metric tonnes.The government has started its preparations as the meteorological department has forecast an early monsoon this year.Khadse also reacted to remarks by NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who defended the planting of water-guzzling sugarcane despite the drought. Pawar had said on Wednesday that though sugarcane is in the spotlight because of the drought, the crop has sustained and transformed the entire rural economy.Khadse said Pawar must be speaking from experience, but added that in such a situation, planning and water management is a must.No one can deny the fact that if sugar mills in drought-hit Latur, Beed and Osmanabad had used water sparingly, the state government would have had to deploy fewer tankers, Khadse said.Currently, 3,351 villages across Maharashtra have no sources of drinking water and are being supplied water by 4,356 tankers, according to data released by the relief and rehabilitation department last week."

For the first time, the government will supply water through rail wagons. We have finalised the plan. The water will be supplied within a fortnight.Responding to a suggestion by former minister Arif Naseem Khan, food and civil supplies minister Girish Bapat said, We will look at introducing temporary ration cards for those who were forced to migrate out of drought-hit areas. The fear with such a scheme is it might encourage more people to migrate. But we will still look at the scheme for areas that have received migrants, to ensure food security till at least the start of monsoon.Read more: Struggle to keep edu dreams afloat in dry Latur cityBapat said the state was considering re-starting the food subsidy plan that was introduced by the previous government for the 1.7 crore above poverty line (APL) card-holders in the state. We will save food grain worth Rs1,000 crore once we link all ration cards in the state to Aadhaar, which will help weed out bogus card holders and black-marketers, said Bapat.Meanwhile, Khadse stoked a controversy by saying, Latur is the hometown of a former chief minister who had an eight-year tenure and was a minister for 25 years. Its very unfortunate that despite this it is seeing such tough days. Instead of helping the city, people built barrages on the Manjara dam and drew water for their own sugar factories.Provide water first, chant slogans laterThe Shiv Sena on Thursday took a dig at CM Devendra Fadnavis for his remarks over Bharat Mata Ki Jai asking him to first provide water to the thirsty. The drought situation has worsened in the state and the problem will not be solved by chanting Bharat Mata Ki Jai, read the editorial in Saamna, the party mouthpiece."
5b2e32f79855b7245313f93d,Mumbai-Chennai Train Travel Costs Same as 1 Kg Paneer,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/at-rs-300-mumbai-chennai-by-train-costs-same-as-1-kg-of-paneer/story-Jv5CbthGm94e6R2PfogU6I.html,2016-03-31,"Just how affordable is train travel in India?The Railway Board  the apex body of the state-owned transporter  has answered that question in a rather compelling manner.Sample this: The price of a train journey in the general class from Delhi to Chandigarh is a mere Rs 95  the cost of toothpaste of 140 grams. The Mumbai to Chennai distance in the same category of travel can be covered for Rs 300  the price of one kilogram of paneer. For Rs 20  less than the price of a kilogram of sugar  one can complete a train journey from Lucknow to Kanpur.If the top rail bureaucracy has taken the effort to put together such facts in an official note, the reasons are understandable: While direct and indirect hikes in passenger fares for the AC classes have intermittently come, fares for the unreserved, general class have remained unchanged in the last decade.Losses in passenger earnings, meanwhile, have mounted and were placed at an enormous Rs 30,000 crore in the last fiscal year.In a presentation made to railways minister Suresh Prabhu recently, officials put across this point in a straightforward manner: The political resistance to the idea of raising fares for general class passengers must finally and decisively be overcome.Ninety five percent of passengers travelling on the network of the Indian Railways are general class travelers.The option of hiking fares in higher classes no longer exists, as fares for these categories is already high and passenger volumes in these categories have been falling on account of competition from roads and airlines. However, even a marginal increase in fares for the general class will bring in big revenues for the railways, a senior ministry official said.Former railway board member Subodh Jain views the option of raising fares for general class passengers as a flawed and misplaced idea.General class passengers are those that constitute the nations economic activity, while also generating maximum revenues for the railways by way of passenger earnings. They travel in inhuman conditions with no onboard catering or toilet facilities. Burdening such passengers with fare hikes would be criminal, Jain said.With the current NDA dispensation  as with the earlier UPA government  the subject of general class fares have been a red herring of sorts.Shortly after the NDA assumed power, Prabhus predecessor and then railways minister DV Sadananda Gowda announced a 14.2% hike in passenger fares across the board, but promptly rolled it back for general class travellers in the Mumbai suburban system at the insistence of the Shiv Sena.During UPA-II, Trinamool Congress chief and persuaded then prime minister Manmohan Singh to remove her nominee Dinesh Trivedi as the railways minister after he announced a hike in all classes of fares. Fares for the general class were subsequently rolled back.The clamour for a hike in passenger fares for the general class as a measure of hauling the state-owned transporter out from its current state of financial crunch has once again started to resonate in the corridors of the Rail Bhawan.Rail finances have been in the red in past years, given the mounting graph of the operating ratio (paisa spent against every rupee earned by the transporter).Prabhus position has been that the fare hike option should be exercised as the last resort, as he has instructed the bureaucrats in his ministry to work out innovative strategies to cut losses and generate additional revenues.In a paper submitted to Prabhu, the Railway Board members argue that train fares are not only approximately one-fourth the price of a bus fare but were as ridiculously low as a price of a geometry box in some cases.According to a comparative fare chart prepared by the officials, the bus fare to travel the 278-kilometer distance from Lucknow to Gorakhpur is Rs. 394, while the train fare in the general class is priced at Rs. 95 - the price of one kilogram of detergent powder. The Kolkata-Chennai General Class fare of Rs. 360/- is equivalent to the cost of one kilogram of tea leaf."

Some 10.9% of Maharashtras population already battles diabetes. The ICMR study is the first to find out if there is a difference in the number of people with diabetes in urban and rural areas.For this, it looked at Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Chandigarh.While more people in the cities have diabetes, the villages are not far behind.Rural areas are fast catching up, said Dr V Mohan, the principal investigator of the study. Dr Mohan said in rural Maharashtra, 11% of the people screened were pre-diabetic.Villagers are being exposed to more junk food and better transportation. They will walk less, and eat more junk, all of which will easily covert them to diabetics, said Dr Mohan, adding India has the second-highest conversion rate from pre-diabetic to diabetics, according to another study.This conversion of pre-diabetics, said Dr Mohan, needs to be halted urgently.Seventy percent of Indians stay in rural areas, where even a marginal increase in diabetes would drive up incidence rate of diabetes in India.According to recent estimates by the World Health Organisation, 8% of Indias population is diabetic, and 2% of all deaths could be attributed to the lifestyle disease.Dr Shahshank Joshi, an endocrinologist in Mumbai said variation in the food consumed says a lot about the likelihood of developing diabetes.There are geographical variations in the prevalence of diabetes, as the food consumed in the north is different from the south. The protein-carbohydrate ratio differs in every region, he said.But its not all bad news for the pre-diabetics. Losing weight, walking at least 30 minutes a day and improving diets can help prevent the disease, doctors said.The ICMR study is mapping the prevalence of diabetes across the country. So far, Tamil Nadu tops the list in prevalence, with 13.7% diabetics living in the state that has just 6% of the countrys population.Data from 15 states is being analysed, with the states in the north-east showing lower prevalence when compared to Bihar and Jharkhand.Doctors privy to the data said even rural pockets of Jharkhand is showing a high prevalence of diabetes, indicative of the urbanisation and the subsequent changes in lifestyle and food habits."
5b2e33e99855b7245313fa42,India's Tale of Many Miseries,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/ipl-in-the-times-of-drought-india-s-tale-of-many-miseries/story-sbKinlcWWswYzO5fd3CHjM.html,2016-04-11,"All of good life is vulgar when there is misery around. Feasting in the sight of urchins, for instance, or kissing on the street in a nation starved of feasts, love, sex and foreplay. In the same category of vulgarity is the watering of cricket grounds in a state where there is a drought. It deserves lament, perhaps in a sweet mediocre collegiate poem. But to take the matter to court is out of proportion.The pubic interest litigations against the hosting of a cricket tournament in Maharashtra have fanned a moral outrage that is, like many urban moral outrages, a confluence of serious concerns, contempt for a wealthy organisation, pious exaggerations, irrational arguments and personal agendas.The issue before the Bombay High Court was that Maharashtra should not be allowed to host the Indian Premier League matches because cricket grounds consume thousands of litres of water every day in maintenance. The court saved Saturdays inaugural match but asked, probably with anger, Are cricket matches more important than people? Now, the Board of Control for Cricket in India is a despicable private club of industrialists and politicians, but the courts question was hyperbolic. Also, people matter to the board because that is how it makes money.And what exactly is the reasoning of the court? Is not an international-grade cricket ground maintained when there is no tournament underway? If an active cricket ground exists, it would be watered on most days, or it would die. So why this fuss before the tournament? Also, the calls for the cancellation of matches are comical for a simple reason  it is on the days of the matches that the grounds are not heavily watered.Read | Tackling drought is states responsibility, not cricket boardsThe water that is used on an Indian cricket field, according to an official, is about 15,000 to 20,000 litres of non-potable water a day, or less than five tankers. That is as much fresh water that is required to make one kilo of chocolate, according to the data of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, a global network.Sunil Gavaskar, whose relationship with the BCCI, it is reported, has collapsed and whose lucrative contract with the board may end, wrote in his column, The issue of drought is one such where many lives are at stake. (True). I am no expert on ground and pitch preparation (True) Nor do I know whether the water that will be saved if the matches are not played can be used to irrigate the lands that have become dry and parched. (It cant be used). He went on to suggest that the matches should be moved out of Maharashtra. It is a small price to pay, for the alternative could well be unnecessary loss of lives of those whose hard work gives us our daily roti and dal.This is a mystifying exaggeration  the suggestion that if matches are held in three cricket grounds in Maharahstra the lives of farmers would be at risk. But it is a popular view.Read | No way we can do this: BCCI official on moving Maharashtra IPL matchesThere is much veneration of farmers in India by those who are not farmers. These are the very people whose greatest fortune was that their grandfathers or fathers ejected their progeny from the agrarian economy. Most farmers in India have small land-holdings and they are doomed. The reason why most Indian farms are land waiting to become real estate.If people really cared about water, all they have to do is adopt a healthy diet  quit eating red meat (just one kilo of mutton requires over 10,000 litres of water to produce, or half the quantity of water required by a cricket ground in a day), quit rice (one kilo of rice needs about 2,500 litres of water, but half of this does re-enter the hydrological system), wheat and sugar (about 1,000 to 1,500 litres for every kilo).Read | Tea without sugar more effective than IPL banThe human body does not require rice and wheat. In fact it does very well without grain. Rice and wheat are the staples of the world because they have been subsidised to be so. The world has promoted an unhealthy diet that takes considerable fresh water to produce. Add to it the evil called sugar, we have a species that sucks out water to eat poorly. The hypocrisy of those who are outraged by the watering of cricket grounds lies in their very paunches.And, if people really care about poor farmers they would fight for a greater role of science. India is unable to experiment with biotech, which includes processes to create drought-resistant crops, because the Donald Trump of science, Vandana Shiv has maligned the technology.It was inevitable that the talk of farmers and drought would bring up the outlandish hypothesis of farmer suicides, first popularised by Shiva and later sustained by other noted activists, like P Sainath, because it aligned with their economic grouses. Let me repeat an assertion this column made earlier while arguing that farmer suicides are primarily a depression story where poverty only plays a role:In a country where most people can be termed farmers, it is not anomalous that most people who kill themselves would be farmers. In fact, what is anomalous is that a huge majority of farmers who commit suicide are male. If both official and activist statistics are considered, it would appear that women in impoverished farming communities are among the least likely Indians to commit suicide. Activists who ascribe social, economic and political reasons for suicides would never be able to explain why. In most nations of the world, including India, the number of men who commit suicide is several times more than the number of women. this pattern is reflected in the gender ratio of farmer suicides.But the idea that farmers commit suicide because of crop failure or loans or that India is not socialistic enough, is a beloved of activists. There is a book waiting to be written here if you are interested and may I suggest a title: P Sainath Loves A Good Farmer Suicide.Manu Joseph is a journalist and the author of the novel, The Illicit Happiness of Other PeopleTwitter: @manujosephsanThe views expressed are personal"

A supplementary charge sheet may be filed in the future over the Kalina housing scam, in which the Bhujbals allegedly cheated prospective flat buyers of Rs 44 crore. Bhujbal and Sameer have been arrested by the ED and are currently in judicial custody.A high-ranking ED officer said, Chhagan Bhujbal is the main accused as he was a powerful minister in the Maharashtra government. This would not have been possible without him.An ED source said the charge sheet, which runs into thousands of pages, contains evidence in form of bank-statement analyses, statements of employees of the Mumbai Educational Trust that implicate Bhujbal, an income tax report on the financial health of companies promoted by the Bhujbals, and reports of the Registrars of Companies (ROC).The source added that government employees booked in the case have not been named as accused yet as there is no direct evidence that they were involved in money-laundering. They (government employees) have not been named yet but it does not mean that they have been given a clean chit. Investigations are still in progress and we are collecting evidence, the source said.The charge sheet provides a detailed account of how the Bhujbals allegedly laundered money through a maze of Kolkata-based companies. We have incorporated statements of the Kolkata-based operators, who have also been accused in the case, the source added.HT was the first to report that the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had found that several firms in Kolkata, said to have invested in companies allegedly promoted by the Bhujbals and their associates, were bogus and may have been used for money laundering.The EDs charge sheet alleges that the accused netted Rs 870 crore from the crimes. Assets worth Rs 131.86 crore have been provisionally attached by ED. The attached assets include flats, bungalows, fixed deposits, land, buildings and a sugar factory, said an ED officer."
