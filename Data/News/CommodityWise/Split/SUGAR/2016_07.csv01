He has very low sodium levels; he was kept in the casualty for observation, said a Dr Ahmed Shaikh from GT Hospital.According to the medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr DR Kulkarni, the runners complained of low sugar levels. They were treated and sent home in few hours, he said.Read: Unstoppable Mumbai scores a runaway hitDr Vijay DSilva, medical director and director of critical care, Asian Heart Institute, Bandra, added, The marathon started early and the cold weather made it easier for runners and reduced the cases of dehydration.Last year, 14 runners had to be admitted, but, this year, doctors said the runners were fitter.The organisers had qualifying guidelines so people not fit enough to run the Full or Half Marathon got filtered out. In the first year, we treated a woman who suffered a heart attack and she had participated against her doctors advice. People have become more aware now, said Dr Vijay DSilva, medical director and director of critical care, Asian Heart Institute.Last year, we treated patients with cardiac conditions. This year, we had a few patients who were brought to the hospital with dehydration and did not need hospitalisation, said Dr BK Goel, senior cardiologist, Bombay Hospital.Dr PS Ramani, 78, who has never missed the marathon, completed the Half Marathon. I completed the run in two hours and 42 minutes, he said."

One waits not just for the right house at right price but right and auspicious date and time too. With the festival period on, the right time has arrived and many homes are likely to find their proud owners. But if you are a first-time home buyer, dont let the feelings overpower and confuse you.A traditionally family affair is likely to spoil you with options and suggestions but one can easily tide over this task with patience and intelligence.In todays digital age, if resources are judiciously utilised, some common mistakes can be comfortably avoided. Here is a list of top five mistakes that are commonly made but easily avoidable:*Budgeting: Buying a home is one of the most prized and costliest purchases of your lifetime, therefore, budgeting is the key. Venturing out and visiting properties without completing this step is a futile exercise.Assess your financial health and then work out a budget that is comfortable for you and doesnt impact your everyday life. While working out your monthly expenses, remember to keep provision for contingency funds too.Post this, you will be in a better position to finalise budget for your dream home. It is recommended that you spend no more than 28% of your monthly income on home loan EMIs (equated monthly installments). If you stretch beyond 30% then youre toeing on risky territory. Once budget is finalised, stick to it. It is a common practice to stretch few lakhs but remember that the budget you worked out did take care of it, so please adhere to it.*Lack of research: After budget is worked upon, the next important step is research. This has no short cuts and certainly cannot be escaped or left incomplete under any circumstance. It is only after research that you will know the best available options in your budget.Your research should take into account property prices, market trends, location-wise pricing, etc. Based on what fits your bill, narrow your search and draw a list of target projects.Today, we have an active social media, hence it will be a good idea to read about identified projects online too.However, a word of caution, dont follow them blindly. It has been observed that while few vent out responses, the other few are sugar coated and marketing initiatives. Hence, be judicious and alert. While you are collecting data, record it in an organised manner for quick reference at a later stage.*Size of the house: Buying too small a house or big, both are not desired. However, many find themselves in this mess. Couple of factors that should be taken into account while deciding this include  your wedding plans, when do you plan to start a family, are you expecting your parents and family to often stay with you in future, and will you have 24-hour help at home. Depending on the responses, you will be able to take a wise decision about the floor space.If you are buying a ready-to-move-in apartment, it is advised that you take into account minimum of 5-8 years time. However, if you chose to purchase an under-construction property, please add additional 3-5 years for construction.*Growth outlook: All investments have a crucial parameter of future growth, house is no different. Gone are the days when people would build one house and live their entire life in it.Today, based on requirements, home buyers do not shy away from selling and buying a new, improved apartment. Thus, outlook on property appreciation is very important.While evaluating growth, one should consider factors like infrastructure plans of the locality, size of the adjacent and front roads, near-by real estate activities, availability of basic services like hospital and medical services, education institutes/schools, local grocery store/super market, and connectivity with other business areas etc. In addition, also keep a watch on commercial activities like upcoming IT parks, SEZs.*Background check of the builder: Recent past has shown that even big names have fallen short of their promises, thus it is advised that you carry a thorough check on the builders background. These checks will give you a good indication about the quality of the construction, completion and timely delivery of projects, premium amenities, and legal and litigation-free house, etc. Bearing these things in mind, one is sure to land with a house that is his/her dream house. Happy home buying!(The writer is Executive Director at Unishire)"

South African captain Faf du Plessis happens to be one of them. In the recent Test against Australia, he had a lolly on his tongue when he used his spit to shine the ball. Caught on tape, the ICC fined him, denying him his entire match fee. It was seen as a code of conduct breach, condemned as an unlawful act of changing the ball condition. Du Plessis says he did no wrong, he was merely shinning the ball, not doctoring it. He appealed. Now, the ICC isnt pleased, an intriguing inquest is on the cards and, in all likelihood, crickets ever-changing rule book might see yet another rewrite.As expected, the ICC is isolated; du Plessis has received overwhelming support. Aussie skipper Steve Smith said his team too shines the ball like the South African. The undetectable English sarcasm was hard to miss when English pacer Chris Woakes asked the ICC to ban candies. The ambiguity of the law has triggered wide-spread indignation. The ball can be glowed by salty sweat but not by sugary saliva. And what if a player shines the ball seconds after spitting out the toffee, doesnt the objectionable sugar linger in his mouth and travel on to the fading lacquer? Next, will the umpire be strapped with rinse bowls or will the ICC call for spit-tests to check the sugar content?Cricket, intrinsically an amateur game that not too long ago played on the belief that anyone wearing flannels was a gentleman, has repeatedly struggled to be part of professional sports where every advantage is ruthless exploited. No doubt, with time, the rules need to change. However, law-makers need to be sympathetic to bowlers, crickets under-privileged. Bats have become bigger, pitches died long back, bouncers are rationed, now cant the pacer shine the ball? Let them have candies, at least.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
