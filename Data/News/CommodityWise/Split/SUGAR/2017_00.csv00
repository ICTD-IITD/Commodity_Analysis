High on local brew, these tuskers have run amok, damaging settlements and claiming over 50 lives last year alone.Some villagers have heeded the advisory, many are still reluctant, according to forest department officials conducting awareness drives against homemade liquor. Elephant herds come sniffing from more than 10km away for the pungent beverages, said Naved Shujauddin, divisional forest officer of Surajpur.Sashi Bhushan Kirketta, a resident of Neematoli village of Jashpur district, is among those who have decided to quit brewing the liquor. We have stopped brewing liquor from mahua (a nectar-rich flower) because of elephants. Whoever is still brewing it is ensuring it is sold quickly to avoid storing it in the village. Kirketta acknowledged people always knew homemade liquor caught the fancy of elephants, but their incursions had become too frequent and destructive to ignore.Apart from entering villages while foraging for food  particularly jackfruit, sugarcane and paddy  elephants also get drawn to mahua sharaab and paddy-based drinks favoured by tribals. Their forays often lead to houses being destroyed and even deaths.Though a comprehensive official report is awaited, more than 50 people died across Chhattisgarh in human-elephant conflict in 2016, said an official who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.The fatalities marked a rise from 2015 when, according to forest department data, 44 people died in human-animal conflict. Such conflicts are routinely reported from Jashpur, Balrampur, Surguja, Surajpur, Dharamjaigarh, Raigarh and Korba regions.Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha have 10% of the elephants in India but, on an average, account for approximately 65% of human casualty due to the human-elephant conflict, according to a Greenpeace report.Forest guards are at the forefront of the governments awareness drives against homemade liquor. They are engaging youth under the Hathi Mitra Dal (friends of elephants) programme and also training them on preventing elephant attacks and good practices, said Manoj Pandey, divisional forest officer (DFO), Jashpur. Hathi Mitra Dals abound in north Chhattisgarh.Senior forest department officers said the human-elephant conflict in the northern parts started in the late 1980s when 18 elephants migrated from neighbouring Jharkhand (then a part of Bihar) and Odisha. These officers estimate the number of elephants in the region has now swelled to more than 300.Bilaspur-based wildlife activist Neetu Gupta blames the human-elephant conflict on decreasing forest cover because of mining and development projects. Incidentally, Sarguja, Raigarh and Korba have nearly 100% of the coal reserves of Chhattisgarh. Wildlife activists claim most mining areas are on routes elephants use."

The statement came after the division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai said that Hazare could not invoke extraordinary jurisdiction of the high court for CBI probe in his allegations, without first using available alternate remedies.The bench has now posted the public interest litigation filed by the 79-year-old activist for further hearing on February 13, after Talekar sought time of one month to pursue alternate remedies.Hazare has sought in-depth probe in the sale and privatisation of 47 CSFs alleging that the scam has been maneuvered by NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and his nephew Ajit Pawar. In the PIL filed through advocate Vinod Sangavikar, the social activist has alleged that the cooperative sugar factor scam has engulfed Maharashtra and pushed the state back by at least 50 years by causing loss of over Rs10,000 crore to the state exchequer. He also claimed that the move put the state under a debt of over Rs1 lakh crore.According to the PIL, most of the CSFs  31 of the 47 have been sold by the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank. In 2011, the Reserve Bank of India scrapped the board of directors of the MSC bank, and appointed two administrators. The move came after the bank in 2009-10 reported net loss of Rs 775.98 crore and bad loans of over Rs 500 crore  about 30 % of its total advances, and the net worth of the bank had gone below zero - at minus Rs140 crores.Thereafter, the Commissioner for Cooperation had appointed a senior official to enquire into the affairs of the bank and enquiry officer in his report of January 2014 concluded that the sale of the CSFs was illegal, causing losses of about Rs2,000 crore to the bank. Besides, 77 directors of the bank are facing charges of misappropriating funds to the tune of Rs 1,076 crores, stated the PIL.Anna has alleged that all the strings were pulled by Shri Sharad Pawar, who was holding the portfolio of the Union agricultural minister at Centre at the relevant time and also the ex-officio chairman of Vasantdada Sugar Institute. His PIL further alleges that most of the sugar factories have been sold to the associates of Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar, the then deputy chief minister, has purportedly played a role in his capacity as the then chairman of Pune District Central Cooperative Bank and as director of the MSC bank.Read more: Sugar scam: Sharad Pawar to file suit against Anna Hazare"

However, the area is cramped with narrow bus bays; and share autos make it worse.B Harikrishnan says he travels from the industrial estate to his college in Thoraipakkam daily and it is becoming difficult to board a bus because of share autos which harass people to use them. He said during peak hours, the buses come packed and MTC drivers skip the stop as share autos park their vehicles in the bay.Buses operating out of Guindy estate take different routes towards Anna Salai, Thiruvanmiyur and Velachery. The bays are congested and dont have seats for the public. Autos speed through the bays at times, causing minor accidents, said a sugarcane juice vendor at Guindy industrial estate.Commuters want traffic cops to limit the share autos entering the bus stand and the corporation should take steps to expand the area.When contacted, an official of J3 police stations traffic wing said, Traffic police can only regulate the traffic, but controlling share autos is the RTOs responsibility.In response, an MTC official said it did not own the land where the bus stand was. The industrial estate authorities allotted the land. So the MTC could not expand the bus stand. Public can petition the CMs cell or transport grievance cell explaining their problems and seek a remedy, the official said."

(File) Vanita (right) at her stall selling organic moong and flour. On the extreme left is her daughter and daughter-in-law. (Below) A woman entrepreneur displays her implements to fashion rolling pins. Express Photo Kavitha Iyer. (File)FOR SNEHA Devgirikar and women running the 59 other stalls at the Mann Deshi Mahila Festival for rural women entrepreneurs, demonetisation is no longer a hurdle. Ever since she took her first loan of Rs 12,000 from the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, nearly a decade ago, to launch her business selling homemade papads, Sneha has learnt to upgrade her skill set at every milestone. The Satara resident had in six or seven years learnt how to market her business, burnish her brand called Renuka Masalas, package her organic products so that they appeal to urban consumers and more.So, when Mann Deshi Foundation decided to move its annual festival, showcasing farm produce and rural women entrepreneurs products from Satara to Mumbai for the first time, Sneha and the others simply got acquainted with the mobile wallet technology and downloaded the apps necessary.In Prabhadevis Rabindra Natya Mandir, each one of the 60 stalls selling farm produce  ranging from bajra, jowar and millet to freshly-handcarved wooden rolling pins and homemade pickles  comes with a story not unlike Snehas. Every stall is run by a woman who has built assets by developing her potential as an entrepreneur and a leader. All these women are associated with the Mann Deshi Foundation, which is headquartered in Mhaswad, Satara, and had been active in the drought-hit district since 1996.Vanita Pise, 42, a resident of Mhaswad, never completed her Class X. Chaperoning her daughter and daughter-in-law at her stall where shes selling organic moong and flour, Vanita talks confidently about the drought, market fluctuations and the dipping demand that affects her multiple businesses. She further explains how a drought year hits farm economy and how she had tried to focus her business ideas on areas that are not water dependent.I had been in touch with the Mann Deshi Foundation since 2003, when I started small savings in a bachat gat. Through my association with the women at the foundation, I started a business making paper cups. I bought a machine and started making cups, working hard to make sure not to let loadshedding hours affect my output, she said. The idea of a paper cup-making machine came from the foundation as did the training in marketing and sales, but Vanita added to it her own chain of raw material suppliers and the buyers of her finished products, along the way employing women who she paid weekly. I also managed to give employment to one young girl, who was disabled, she added.Vanita is now a director of the board of the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, and though she never completed her matriculation, she made sure her children get the best education she could afford. Even as she expanded her business to also make premium paper plates, she saw one daughter complete her MCA degree while the younger girl is studying to be a civil engineer.That sense of empowerment alongside willingness to work hard and beat the odds is common among all our women, says Vanita Shinde of the foundation. And so, at the exhibition is Sanjana Salunkhe, who grows sugarcane in a small three-acre patch of land. She cut the cane herself and had it loaded into a tempo to bring to the exhibition where shes selling freshly-crushed sugarcane juice in disposable tumblers.Also at the exhibition is Kantabai Salunkhe, one of the first women to have approached the founders in the mid-1990s, complaining that banks denied her a applications for loan because, at her daily savings rate of Rs 2 or Rs 3, she was just not an affordable customer for any nationalised bank.Chetna Sinha, 58, the founder of Mann Deshi Foundation, is thrilled at the success of their first attempt to bring their annual exhibition to Mumbai. Even though there are only 60 stalls here, compared to the much larger 200-plus stalls and exhibition grounds in Satara city, business is booming at each of these stalls. There is still work to be done and improved upon, she says. For one, access to credit for rural women remains an area that needs sustained research by banking institutions. Mann Deshi offers a model, but there is still so much to understand about a range of possibilities between microfinance and the Mudra loans for micro units.Theres one more thing Sinha believes is the need of the hour. More promotion and more recognition for men and families who really support women entrepreneurs, without that, this movement will find it difficult to move forward. The Mann Deshi exhibition by rural entrepreneurs concludes on Sunday at Ravindra Natya Mandir, Prabhadevi; 9.30 am to 8 pm)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Here the are excerpts:HT: Historically, Punjab polls have been a two-party affair. This time, do you think its going to be a three-horse race in Punjab this time?Sukhbir: Actually its still a two-party game with the second party divided into two, three, or four, or five. Akali Dal is still there as one united party and we have our own space which we are retaining.You are confident of a hat-trick though sporting stars such as Pargat Singh, Navjot Singh Sidhu are in the opposite camp. Where does this confidence come from?S: Pattern of voting has changed. Now people do not vote as per history, Panth, or on the lines of pure political affiliations. Today, the new generation, which is a major part of the electorate, votes keeping in view performance. If you look at our performance and compare it with others, it stands out completely. Keeping this in view, we are sure people will vote for performance.Why should people give another mandate to the Shiromani Akali Dal?Harsimrat: Because of the work done. Three key things  development, peace, and communal harmony Its a matter of pride that you have Prime Minister and finance minister of the country turn around and tell us that development in Punjab surpasses any other state And development undertaken during this term surpasses even our own previous five-year tenure. Its a government how its supposed to be  of the people, by the people, for the people. There are people who say 70% of Punjabis are nashedi (drug addicts). Its actually like throwing muck at yourself. How can you do that for the sake of politics? Its very sad. There is a new party, which says something in Punjab and after crossing the border says something else.What is the single most important achievement of your government?S: Fulfilling all promises that I made. Unprecedented development that even Congress cannot deny. Who could think 10 years back that we will make Punjab power surplus, Mohali international airport, connecting every town with express highways!Will development really get you votes?S: My style of politics is different. Winning and losing is in the hands of God. My passion is to create something and set examples, that if government wants it can deliver. It is a passion.Whom do you consider a formidable challenger in this election? Congress or AAP?S: Congress! AAP is nowhere.Why not AAP?S: AAP was, about a year-and-half back because it was something new. Punjabis love new things; they buy new things and discard the old ones. AAP was a new party and people discarded the old parties.H: Its made in China!S: I agree, AAP is made in China! Reality of Kejriwal has come out in the open.What is that reality?S: They want to fight in Punjab. But they do not know the culture of Punjab, the ethos of Punjab, what Punjabis stand for. They do not know what Panth is. They think the formula they used in Delhi will work here. There is a difference of day and night between Delhi and Punjab. By chance, God forbid, if AAP comes to power, they will create chaos here. It believes in agitation, not in governance. Kejriwal wants to become Punjab CM A state like Punjab need help and support of government of India every minute. We are a border state. We want peace here. You will be surprised that Kejriwal comes to Punjab and starts liaisoning with radicals. The day before yesterday (Thursday) he was having breakfast with Akhand Kirtni Jatha, which is a political front of Babbar Khalsa International, the biggest terrorist organisation He has dinner with the three jathedars appointed by the Sarbat Khalsa that declared Khalistan.H: What is dangerous about this party (AAP) is that it is a party of opportunists. They will dump Punjab at the first opportunity and run away.Why are youngsters enamoured with AAP?H: I dont think they are enamoured with AAP.Is this due to disenchantment with your government?S: No, not anymore. Kejriwal has dumped everybody who has helped him. First he dumped Anna Hazare, then Yogendra Yadav, and then he dumped (Sucha Singh) ChhotepurH: He will dump Punjab alsoS: If your check records, 38 candidates of AAP have criminal records such as murder and cheating.AAP has put up Sikh faces against CM Badal, and against you.S & H (together): What have they put up?S: Is Bhagwant Mann a Sikh? He goes to Darbar Sahib after getting drunk. He goes to Talwandi Sabo Takht sahib after having alcohol.H: He is the first MP asked by the (Lok Sabha) speaker being asked to stay out because his colleagues could not put up with the stench of alcohol coming from him!There have been two prominent poll surveys so far  one favours you and the other says Congress will win. Do you believe in these surveys?S: No, I dont believe in these surveys because I know the reality behind such surveys. These are all manipulated.A widespread perception is that you are facing double anti-incumbency. What is going against your government?S: You will talk about triple incumbency when we will fight for a fourth consecutive term. I go to the field every day. We can judge the public mood from the face expressions of the common man Elections are won by cadre. If your army is strong, you will win a battle. If the army is demoralised, you can never win. And our army this time is more charged than it was in the 2012 elections.What prompted you to put General JJ Singh (retd) against Punjab Congress chief Capt Amarinder from Patiala?S: He was the first Sikh to be chief of army staff; and is very competent.H: Three generations in the army!S: Should I tell you something? He himself came to me.H: He wants to trump the Captain.And you didnt have any candidate from Patiala?S: Candidate was not an issue. Look at his passion. A chief of army staff wanted to join Akali Dal and wanted to fight. He is the best bet.H: Captain is from a royal family; and heres a soldier (JJ Singh) who fought and defended the nation and stands for sacrifice. So the real Captain and the real soldier  its going to be a fight between raja (king) and runk (commoner).The drug issue has been resonating in Punjab. How serious is it?H: Certain political parties can stoop to any extent, whether it is an attack on Darbar Sahib or the katle-aam (massacre) in 1984, or even coming to Punjab and declaring all Punjabis as drug addicts. They make political statements only to demolish opponents.So, is there no drug problem in Punjab?H: There is as much drug (abuse) in Punjab as there is anywhere else in the country.S: How many people, children do you know who are into drugs? I am shocked at the opposition. You should not insult your homeland.Why would your rival parties do that?S: Look, say all that you want against the Badal family, but please dont say Punjab youth is addicted to drugs. Thats why we were forced to do drug test!What was the result (of tests conducted on 4 lakh male aspirants in police recruitment last year)?S: 1.26 % (found hooked to drugs)!Harsimrat, when your brothers name cropped up in drug scam, how did you feel, as a sister?H: Obviously, it hurts. Congress is very good at planning and plotting such things despite the fact that it was our party that went after these so-called druglords and caught them from other states. It was Amarinder Singh who had let him (Jagdish Bhola) off, and we went after him and caught him. Five central agencies came to Punjab, when Congress was in power at the Centre, and interrogated this druglord. Congress gave this bright idea to him: Name ruling families and then you will be safe, nothing will touch you and the case will carry on for good. And thats how the whole thing came about! If my brother was involved, why would we go after the druglord? We would have been the first one to let him flee further away. My brother doesnt even take alcohol and meat.S: Ehna (Majithias, Harsimrats paternal family) de kutte vee veg ne! (Even their pet dogs are vegetarian) Frankly speaking, there are thousands of other ways to make money. They have their own sugar mill, they have their own airlines; they have got everything! Do you think they will get into drugs to make money? It is ridiculous.Both AAP and Congress are promising to banish drugs in four weeks.S: Captain sahib nu bolo daru chad den (Tell Captain to quit drinking).In Patna, PM Narendra Modi complimented Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for the prohibition, the liquor ban there. Will you support a liquor ban in Punjab?H: I am a teetotaller, born teetotaller, born vegetarian, despite coming from a family that produces alcohol. There is no one in my family who has ever tasted alcohol. Yes, I will definitely support prohibition.Whats your view, Sukhbir?H (laughs): He would lose his voice!S: No, no! I dont drink. The issue is that anything you stop will create an underground mafia. Today, you go to Gujarat. I think there is more alcohol consumed in Gujarat than anywhere else in the world. When they started prohibition in Haryana, it created a parallel mafia In Bihar also, its available... We have to educate people to quit liquor.H: In a democracy, you cannot stop peoples food and drink habits, and of course it is very good if the government cdoes something to make availability of liquor difficult. It has become a fashion with youth also. They get pushed into drinks just because of pressure. Its extremely unfortunate.One of the central allegations of AAP is that you and Capt Amarinder are mixed up.S: First of all, Akali Dal can never, ever, ever, align with the Congress. We are ready to leave politics than align with Congress. It is the party that attacked the Golden Temple we can dismantle Akali Dal but cannot align with Congress. This is clear.Your criticism by opponents underlines your business interests. They say, Give Sukhbir five years in power and he builds a five-star hotel for himself!S: The issue is whether or not you want politicians who declare all their assets. There is no newspaper that has not scrutinised my every business. And they could not find a single thing wrong. Amarinder set the state vigilance bureau against me, and they even counted my kids dresses.H: Even the kitchen items!S: They could not find anything wrong. There is also no conflict of interest. It shows that we are like an open book.H: Unlike Amarinder, who opened Swiss bank accounts during his government but does not declare them.Your critics say you have reduced politics to management of polls.S: You cannot win an election by management alone. Today, you call me a very good manager. If I lose an election, you will question my managerial skills. It is all Gods will.Badal Senior has been fighting Gandhi dynasty his entire life. Now he is promoting one at home.H: Sukhbir has delivered, to be where he is today.S: I will tell you something. The person who has come maximum in the way of my political career is my father. When I got into politics, he told me, Eh toh baad mein nai kuch karna (I will not do anything beyond this). Can you imagine that when I used to be on the stage, I used to put my name on the list of those who wanted to speak; and he used to cut my name! I used to call the person (handling the list) and tell him, I will not let you enter my house if you dont write my name. I had to prove to the party that I can do better than others. I was looking after Youth Akali Dal first. I made the YAD crowds bigger than the main Akali Dal crowds at rallies. I had to prove myself again and again and again.Now we have many sons and sons-in-laws of Akali leaders in the fray.S: Look, if you go to buy a horse, you look at its pedigree! A family which is looking after a particular constituency  people trust them. They want the next generation to also come and take care of them. It is trust in a family. Not all politicians sons are successful... I can give you so many examples.H: Rahul Gandhi!You have three kids. Would you like for them to be in politics?H: I was not inclined myself, what about my kids! It was all destiny.S: It all depends on circumstances.H: We got married on the condition that you (Sukhbir) will not enter politics. How could you forget that?S: You know who got her into politics? Capt Amarinder Singh! Because he sent his son to our home constituency Bathinda and challenged us to field someone against his son. We were left with no choice When we asked her to contest, she was doing sewa (voluntary service) at some gurdwara She didnt know where Bathinda was also!H: My daughter called up her grandfather (CM Badal) saying, We dont see our father, now we wont see our mother also. It was a huge turmoil.S: Politics is the most difficult profession, a thankless job. People forget the 10 favours you did to them but will remember the one you didnt. Let me give you an example. We changed the look of Bathinda city. We changed the lives of the people. What looked like a gutter we made it look like a palace. But she lost by 30,000 votes from there (in 2014 Lok Sabha tally as part of larger Bathinda seat).Does that mean development does not get votes?S: People have no concept... asi dhakka karan wale log nahi haan (We are not ones who will force people to vote). We are very soft.Nearly 1.4 crore people are covered under the atta-dal scheme, which is 80% of the states population. Is Punjab that poor?S: Its as per directions of the Government of India, that urban areas have to be covered 45% and rural areas 55%. The Food Security (Act) was passed by them. If people are getting some benefit, it is fine.Amarinder has been promising 50 lakh mobile phones, one job per family. Kejriwal is also promising sops. Where can the money come from? Punjab is under heavy debt.S: Look at the AAP manifesto in Punjab  a photocopy of its Delhi manifesto! Captain sahib is desperate. He has already said that it is his last election. He has no passion to perform. I have to perform to come back a third time. Captain sahib wants to lead an easy, cushioned life. Among the three parties, just see whose commitment level is high. AAP has no commitment level.What role do you, Harsimrat, play in Sukhbirs politics and the way he runs the government?H: My father told me, You follow him, and everything else will follow. It was a fantastic quote.What was the toughest time you had in the government?S: It was the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib. It was such a sad affair. That one month was very tough.Harsimrat, do you see yourself playing a more active role in state politics, say, as the Akali Dals first woman CM?H: Are you kidding? Not a chance! I am not even fit to be at the position I am in. I have no such aspirations whatsoever. I had a different life and I got pushed into somewhere else. Badal sahib asked me to give my best shot, and I did.How would you rate Sukhbirs performance on a scale of 1 to 10?H: If I had a choice, I will give him 15 out of 10! There is no doubt that our home and his health have been sacrificed, but the man has talent. If you look at the way he has done his business; the way he has transformed Punjab. If his father came with experience and his connect with the people, Sukhbir came with a vision. It was larger than life and way beyond what anybody could even imagine. He has brought Punjab to this level!Its election time; do you feel like a student facing exams every time?H: That is what he was telling our daughter, that my exams are before yours.S: I love a fight. I am a fighter. It is like a war room where all your strategies are taking shape. It is very exciting. But it is not an easy game. The best thing for Punjab is my father. He is like an umbrella. If, God willing, we get another five years, you will see a level of development you could not even imagine. We will bring a radical change.H: We have put the building blocks in place and built on it. If a lazy Captain or an opportunist (like) Kejriwal comes to power, they will take Punjab back, which will be sad.In UP, we have recently seen a father-son (Mulayam-Akhilesh Yadav) split while the Badals in Punjab are still going strong. Whats the secret?S: Politics is my fathers life. For the last 10 years, the media has been writing, Sukhbir to be sworn in this Monday, on Diwali, and so on! I have always said that as long as my father is fit, he will continue to be CM. And I am saying this today also. If we win and he is fit, he will be CM.H: He (Sukhbir) has changed so much in the last 10 years. He was impulsive. I used to tell him, Why dont you become like your father? There is so much to be imbibed from dad.S: Working under him is the best experience one can get. Its like joining Harvard Business School. He has the passion, dedication and commitment for the people that no one else can have. Even I dont have it.(Transcribed by Pawan Sharma and Sukhdeep Kaur)"

But we want to change this into brain gain, he said.PKVY, which was launched recently, will provide skill development and orientation to youth in their chosen field of vocation. For those workers who seek economic opportunities abroad, our effort is to provide maximum facilitation and ensure least inconvenience, Modi said.In his speech delivered in English, peppered with Hindi, to a full house at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre, Modi pointed out that the remittances made by overseas Indians stood at $69 billion, making it an invaluable contribution to the Indian economy. He hailed the contributions made by the Indian diaspora across the world, but stopped short of making any big-ticket announcement.We do not see the colour of the passports, but the relations written by blood matter the most, he said.Modi said the Centre has extended the last date for those holding Person of Indian Origin (PIO) cards to covert them into Overseas Indian Citizen (OIC) cards till June 30 this year without any penalty.Earlier, the government had set December 2016 as the deadline. He said special counters will be set up at immigration points in the New Delhi and Bengaluru airports for OIC card holders, who will get the benefit of securing life-long visa for visiting India any number of times.They will also be exempted from registration with the local police authority for any duration of stay in India.The prime minister said new procedures and documentation requirements will be put in place so that Girmitiyas from India become eligible for OIC cards.Girmitiyas are descendents of indentured Indian labourers of the last century hired by European countries to work on sugarcane plantations in their colonies. The descendents are mainly confined to Mauritius, Fiji, the Reunion Islands, Suriname, Guyana and Caribbean states.We are aware of the difficulties faced by Persons of Indian Origin from Girmitiya countries in obtaining an OIC card if they had moved abroad four or five generations ago, he said.The scheme will start with Mauritius and later extend to the other countries.Thank you, NRIsPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday thanked the Indian diaspora for supporting the Centres move against corruption and called opponents of demonetisation political worshippers of black money, reports DHNS. Raising the demonetisation issue at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, Modi said, Black money and corruption were gradually corroding our polity, economy, society and the country, and we launched a massive campaign against it. Some political worshippers (rajnaitik pujari) of black money did their best to portray our efforts as anti-people."

Another reason for the slow sale is the late start to the season.The dip in sales comes at a time during a season when sugar production has been hit due to less cane. Maharashtra, which produces 34 per cent of the countrys sugar, has reported 6.33 lakh hectare of cane and sugar production is estimated to be 445 lakh tonnes as compared to the 742 lakh tonnes of sugar produced last season.Watch What Else Is making NewsSanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation said, demonetisation has played a major role in the dip of sugar sales. Retail customers constitute 25 per cent of the sugar consumption and that market has been hit the hardest. Many retail customers have curtailed their sugar purchases, he said. Cyclic nature of the business has resulted in sugar sales being affected across the supply chain, which leads straight to the sugar mills. In want of liquidity in the markets, consumers, Babar said, have been cautious in their buying and also have cut down on the monthly stock they normally kept.Another reason for the slow sale is the late start to the season. Babar said besides Maharashtra, states like Uttar Pradesh has also witnessed less sales. Sales might pick up as the season progresses, he said.Meanwhile, Sugar Commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma has called a hearing of millers who have failed to pay 100 per cent of the fair and remunerative price to the millers (FRP). Mills have paid Rs 3,041.80 crores to growers which amounted to 82 per cent of the total amount to be paid.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

American Beverage Association trade group is also made party in the suit along with Coca Cola, for down playing risks of sugary drinks. (Source: Reuters)Coca-Cola Co and the American Beverage Association trade group were sued on Wednesday for allegedly misleading consumers about the health risks from consuming sugary beverages. The nonprofit Praxis Project accused the defendants of downplaying the risks to boost sales, despite scientific evidence linking sugary beverages to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Watch What Else is Making NewsPraxis accused both defendants using euphemisms such as balance and calories in, calories out to mislead consumers, and Coca-Cola of blaming a lack of exercise as the real cause of obesity.The notion that Cokes products can be part of a healthy diet is imprinted on the minds of millions if not billions of people, and requires corrective action, Maia Kats, litigation director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which helped file the lawsuit, said in an interview.Coca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers called the lawsuit legally and factually meritless. We take our consumers and their health very seriously and have been on a journey to become a more credible and helpful partner in helping consumers manage their sugar consumption. The American Beverage Association had no immediate comment, but in November said its members were committed to raising consumer interest less-caloric, less-sugary drinks.Wednesdays lawsuit seeks to stop misleading marketing and require more consumer warnings, among other remedies. It was filed with the federal court in Oakland, California. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc have pledged to bolster efforts to reduce added sugar in beverages.In October, Coca-Cola Chief Operating Officer James Quincey, slated to succeed Muhtar Kent as chief executive in May, said the Atlanta-based company has more than 200 reformulation initiatives toward that end.But according to the complaint, a 16-ounce bottle of Coke has 12 teaspoons of added sugar, a 15.2-ounce bottle of Minute Maid Cranberry Grape Juice drink has 13 teaspoons, and a 20-ounce bottle of Vitaminwater has eight teaspoons. By comparison, the American Heart Association recommends no more than nine teaspoons a day for men, and six for women.A teaspoon of sugar has about 16 calories. Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc is Coca-Colas largest shareholder, has said he drinks at least five Cokes a day.The CSPI sued PepsiCo in October over health claims for its Naked juices, but did not target that company in Wednesdays lawsuit.

Aside from sugar, rubber and coconut plantations, there are areas and camps held by rebels that we cannot easily enter,"" jail warden Peter Bongngat told AFP.The southern Philippines is home to a decades-old Muslim separatist insurgency, as well as extremist gangs that have recently declared allegiance to the Islamic State.The southern region of Mindanao is the ancestral homeland of the Muslim minority in the largely Catholic Philippines.The badly overcrowded jail in Kidapawan, 950 kilometres (590 miles) south of Manila, contained rebels from the various groups as well as members of criminal gangs that thrive in the corruption and poverty of the south.The jail, which housed about 1,500 inmates, is a run-down former school building that militants have targeted repeatedly over the past 15 years.In 2007, Khair Mundos, a Filipino who would later become one of the world's most wanted accused terrorists escaped along with 48 other inmates. Mundos, with a $500,000 bounty from the US government, was recaptured in Manila seven years later.However Wednesday's jailbreak was the biggest in the nation's history, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology spokesman Xavier Solda told AFP.- High-value targets -Solda said 13 ""high-value targets"" -- seven Muslim rebels and six organised crime gang members -- had not been able to escape on Wednesday.However Solda and Bongngat were not able to tell AFP who was still on the run, saying their identities were still being ""verified"".On Wednesday, Bongngat said the attackers were believed to be militants who had broken away from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the nation's largest Muslim rebel organisation which is in peace talks with the government.The MILF, which has about 10,000 armed followers, has been fighting since the 1970s for independence or autonomy.The rebellion has claimed more than 120,000 lives although the MILF has in recent years observed a ceasefire as part of the peace process.MILF spokesman Von al-Haq insisted Thursday that none of its members was involved in the raid, adding the group was willing to coordinate with government to allow searches in its communities.""The commander named to be the leader of the raid was 100 percent a notorious criminal. He was never a member of the MILF,"" Al-Haq told AFP.Al-Haq said the commander, known by an alias of Commander Derby, had broken into the jail to release a relative who was the leader of the Muslim inmates.Al-Haq said the relative and the leader of the Christian inmates were among the first to escape, and remained on the run."

Apart from it being totally delicious and an absolute treat for our taste buds, we know little to nothing.There is a whole lot of process and care that goes into crafting each bar of chocolate that we love so much. Few know this fact better than Jacob Joy and Kishore George of LISO Chocolates, who ventured into chocolate business on their home ground to give the best chocolate experience in the world to chocolate lovers.All of us wait for someone to come from abroad to get our hands on some good chocolates. The question is, why do we wait? Why cant we get it here? A thought that prompted us to come up with LISO, Jacob Joy added.Chocolate-making is a science and an art, which when blended well, gives the finest of chocolate experiences, says Jacob Joy. Jacob and Kishore being childhood friends, had no difficulty in coming together for the sake of chocolates! Jacob is a third generation entrepreneur who was previously involved with manufacturing candies, toffees, and eclairs, while Kishore was engaged with granite business. I moved out of the business because of my passion for chocolates. We were doing researches in parallel , and then the idea struck and LISO breezed in, says Kishore George.Both of them took their diplomas in chocolate manufacturing, and later did a course on fine chocolates. Their families were exposed to business backgrounds, and the drifts and changes were familiar to them, which ensured a wholehearted support to the chocolatiers.The name itself is wrapped in quaint mystery, with LISO meaning smooth in Spanish. It was Kishores idea of tagging a Spanish label as he always felt Spanish was stylish. They use imported base chocolates from Belgium to maintain quality and consistency in taste.The factory at Kolencherry uses both traditional and modern technology, well equipped with high-end European machines and highly skilled craftersmen. Jacob says, Whatever we have learned, we pass it on to the workers here, and they are exposed to hygiene and food quality as well. Unlike home-made chocolates, we are governed by Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).Owing to an increasing demand for quality chocolates, LISO is planning to move across to ten destinations in South India by March 2017. Due to price-wars we are not available at supermarkets but only at exclusive outlets, Kishore George added. LISO offers a variety of premium chocolates, available at their kiosks at Lulu Mall, CenterSquare Mall, Pandhal outlet, and Gourmet Store at Thevara. Theyll soon be available in online shops.Big thematic weddings are one such area where we bag big orders. The hosts probably like to gift a box of chocolate to guests. We have standard as well as customized gift hampers, continued Kishore.People crave for the sugar factor in chocolates. We want to reverse that and take chocolates to a different level. Have a small piece but have a good piece, clears Kishore."

We had a stable and comfortable lifestyle like any army officer family would have, but my parents always taught us we had to work hard to achieve the success in life and that we should never take anything for granted, says Pavani, who is currently the managing director of Zaiwalla & Co.She had to go against the system and prejudice in choosing law. While my family appreciated my choices and encouraged me to follow my dreams, a few friends and relatives chided me. I still remember the day I went for lunch at a family friends house and the host with a sympathetic tone, told my father: I always thought your daughter was bright and it is unfortunate that she has decided to do law instead of engineering or MBBS. I never gave up, she smiles with sparkles in her eyes.In a natural progression, she moved to UK to pursue her dreams and to be with her husband. And as an Indian in the early 2000s, she had a new experience altogether. I enjoyed a new-found freedom in the society which was more accepting and welcoming, but then again everything was new. I had to learn the basics of law. Even today, as a lawyer working in a globally renowned law firm, handling various high profile cases from across the world involves challenges, but owing to my past experiences I am able to manage anything that comes to me, she shares.Over the years, she started to understand the political and legislative parts of the country; there was a frustration within me as she noted that things had to be changed.When I was pursuing my bachelors degree, I successfully applied for a part-time position at a big law firm in New Delhi. I was not only studying at college but also actively participating in court proceedings, getting a first-hand purview of case-building to arguments. As I wanted to gain an international experience, I ventured out of India after I completed my law degree to the UK and started to intern at Zaiwalla & Co solicitors, founded by Sarosh Zaiwalla. Having started as an intern, today I am the Managing Partner at the firm, she shares with a sense of joy.When I first stepped into London for my internship, Sarosh became my mentor. Early in my career, I had to take up a high-profile case for an Indian client. Today, I am handling complicated cases in the country in relation to international sanctions, she adds.Pavani heads the litigation team at the firm handling multi-million pound disputes in the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. Despite a high number of women working these days, reports state that discrimination continues to exist even in western countries.I have noticed instances of unconscious bias which I have been able to overcome. Early in my career, people thought that I may not be able to handle cases firmly because I am a woman. It took a while to prove that I had the equal confidence or the audacity to face challenges.Today, it is no longer the case. Maybe times have changed, or maybe people have learnt I can be equally fierce. Funny, isnt it? Sometimes being a woman, you need to make twice the effort to prove you can do it too, she smirks, questioning the reality.Pavani believes she is a compulsive planner. I start my day at 6:30 am with a two-minute meditation and then go down to the kitchen for a fresh cup of tea. I ensure that my husband and I have tea together. Then I scan my emails which would have arrived overnight on my phone. Since we are a law firm with a largely international client base, my inbox is generally filled with emails from clients around the world: including India, Dubai, Singapore, Iran, Russia, and Kazakhstan. I quickly scroll through the emails and mentally schedule the day ahead.Having grown up in India, I continue the tradition taught to me by mother - I get ready and pray by lighting lamp. However busy the day is going to be, I ensure I spend time with my nine-year-old son to get him ready for school and briefly run through his schedule. I guess its a mothers instinct, she beams.I actually use my 50-minute commute to work to read a book, listen to music or, if there is a court hearing or deadline, I read case documents. I get to the office, my mind then completely turns off from worldly things to focus on cases and office work, she further shares."
58d7bc61a3d24b75f276f00e,Shed those festive kilos right away!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/jan/02/shed-those-festive-kilos-right-away-1555080.html,2017-01-02,"KOCHI: It was not just 2016 that bade adieu, but also days of non-stop partying and reckless indulgence. Its the time of the year when fitness tops everyones wishlist and we are all geared up to jump into a fresh new regimen. If you are guilty of overeating and packing on pounds this December, here are some tips to cut the festival flab and get back in shape.No fad dietsDont set unrealistic goals or follow fad diets, as quick-fixes can cause a variety of health issues in the long run. You cant deny nutrients to your body and go on fasting mode all of a sudden. Go for a balanced diet based on your age, body type and activity level. If you have a very sedentary lifestyle with little or nil physical activity, you should be very careful about your calorie intake. Starving can always lead to overeating which in effect wrecks your metabolic balance. Start thinking in terms of quantity, as moderation is the keyword when you are trying to lose weight. Have small, healthy meals spread out at intervals and stick to low-carb options.Bye bye junkWe all like those greasy sugary bites filled with calories and almost no nutrients. Its not easy to resist cravings but you can always handle the bouts tactfully. If you can survive the first 15 minutes, you can easily fight the urge to binge. And always remember that junk doesnt mean just donuts and French fries, but an array of products with notorious and unhealthy ingredients. You will have to stay away from diet colas to cookies and white breads to samosas. Anything high on sugar, refined grains, salt and fat should be avoided. The reason you quickly gained that extra kilos is the festival menu, the usual fat-and-sugar loaded delicacies that were served at every occasion. The best way to shed that sneaky flab is to stay completely off junk, at least for a month.Switch to wiser optionsStop taking multiple chai breaks and drink oodles of water. Juices with added sugar, aerated drinks and many other seemingly-safe beverages can stand in the way of your fitness. Snacking must be a part of your routine, but skip those calorie-rich options. Always keep a box of cut fruits and veggies ready. You can also snack on dry fruits, but go for very small portions. Heavy dinners should be replaced with light, easy-to-digest options.Burn the caloriesShowing up at the gym is not all that requires to reach your fitness goal. High stress levels and lack of quality sleep can also sabotage your regime. Dont be so hard on yourself while hitting the gym, as excess of exercise, like too much of food, is not good for you. If you dont want to join a gym, hike your activity level. Go for brisk walks, ditch the lift and take up a sport or dance form."

The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

But those gathered at 365 AS, Hyatt Regency, on Tuesday evening were more than glammed up and prepared to whip up their favourites, as Indias top models, Sonalika Sahay and Carol Gracias decided to challenge Swedish professional tennis players Andreas Siljestrom and Johan Brunstrom (in town for the Aircel Chennai Open), to mix better cocktails. The atmosphere was charged with a competitive spirit from both the teams, and adding to the fun elements were the judges of the competition  Shvetha Jaishankar, Anand Amritraj, Kunal Daswani and Soni.Andreas Siljestrom mixing up a cocktailGlasses were taken out, so were the strainers and the whiskey!The first cocktail that all got to taste was a double-strained whiskey and orange juice. The bartender, with much expertise, demonstrated how to mix the drink which was then mimicked and improvised by the contestants. The Swedes in particular were adorably funny with all their fumbling. Siljestrom and Brunstrom used different flavours to give their mix an edge through a lot of sugar, pepperand lemon juice to balance it. While the models for the most part followed the book, they did add a twist to their drink by increasing the amount of whiskey in it.It only got better when Siljestrom decided to be playful and added Worcestershire sauce to their drink. The judges were blown away by both the drinks, especially the now-sour whiskey of the models team. Next up, gin and tonic were taken out, along with mangoes  because the cocktail to be made was gin and tonic with mango piece. The boys created a very healthy and very tasty gin tonic with cucumbers along with mango, while the girls crushed mangoes into theirs, instead of going with a single piece. Even with their setback, team models won the cocktail mixing competition but all was merry as everyone saw a different side to the popular tennis players and the glamourous models. It was my first time mixing cocktails, and I found that it wasnt hard at all! said Siljestrom.Pizza cook-off turns fun contestThe smell of molten cheese and fresh pizza filled Focaccia, Hyatt Regency as models Soni and Sonalika Sahay teamed up against tennis players Roberto Bautista Agut and Steve Darcis in a pizza cook-off! While the judges  Shvetha Jaishankar, Kunal Daswani and Carol Gracia  seemed more intent to taste their pizzas, one question filled the room. Who would win this one, boys or girls?While Agut was fumbling with the pizza bread and toppings, Darcis was seen expertly spreading sauce and adding cheese and meat toppings. The precision with which both were assembling their pizzas, one couldnt help but think that maybe the boys were better cooks than they were given credit for. Both the pizzas were eventually put into the oven, while the girls were no less when it came to assembling their pizzas, though they certainly took a healthier turn in their toppings with olives and veggies.Sonalika, the perfectionist, was worried about ruining her decoration of the bread and kept perfecting it.The time of decision came when the judges tasted both set of pizzas. The reactions were mixed and competition was fierce, with the models eventually prevailing over the judges. The next round was especially hard for Agut, because it was the pani puri round. Ive made Italian food before, so pizza is not hard. But Indian food is a bit out of my comfort zone, said the tennis player. Gloves were worn and pani puri was made much to the delight of all the chaat lovers in the room. The judges seemed alarmed seeing the guys add a lot of chili powder, but all ended well when the pani puris were bearably spicy. The girls though, got their flavours just right, emerging winners of the fun contest."

The State could end up with production of around 4.5 million tonnes,"" B.B. Thombre, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA) told Reuters on Thursday.The WISMA was earlier expecting the country to produce 23 million tonnes of sugar in the 2016/17 crushing season that started on Oct. 1, anticipating Maharashtra will churn out 5.5 million tonnes.As Maharashtra's output has been revised down, the country's total production could fall to 22 million tonnes, Thombre said.Maharashtra had produced 8.41 million tonnes of sugar in the 2015/16 season, while India's total output was 25.1 million tonnes.Sugar mills in Maharashtra typically operate between November to April, but this year so far 25 mills have stopped crushing due to lower cane supplies.""Some sugar mills have already closed operations due to cane shortage and most mills will close operations by February end,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation, on Wednesday.Local sugar prices are moving up on an expected shortfall in output and could prompt the government to allow duty free imports of the sweetener, a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm said on Wednesday.""Ahead of state elections the government will try to keep a lid on prices. Right now it is more interested in protecting consumers than farmers,"" the dealer said.India's election commission on Wednesday scheduled five state polls for the next two months that will test support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's gamble to abolish high-denomination banknotes."

How can you ask for transfer of probe when offence has not been registered?"" the high court said.As Hazare's counsel sought time to register a police case, the bench adjourned the matter to February 13.Hazare has filed two more civil PILs on the same issue which are expected to come up for hearing in due course.The petitions alleged that fraud had been committed in governance by first burdening sugar cooperative factories with debts and thereafter selling these sick units at a throwaway price, causing a loss of Rs 25,000 crore to the government, cooperative sector and members of public.It was prayed that a receiver be appointed to take possession of all properties held by persons against whom a prima facie case exists in the alleged scam.The petitions name Sharad Pawar and Ajit as respondents.Hazare also demanded setting up of a Commission of Inquiry to probe the alleged illegal sale of the sugar factories in Maharashtra either by the Government or the cooperative banks.The petitioner demanded an inquiry by CBI into the allegations of corruption and misuse of government and cooperative funds involving lease and sale of cooperative sugar factories in Maharashtra.The petitioner stated that the statistics and facts mentioned in the petition have been collected from authorities under Right to Information Act.Hazare pleaded that ""the scam"" had ""engulfed the entire state"" and pulled it back by nearly 50 years by causing losses to the government and putting the state under financial debt to the tune of hundreds of crores of rupees.Pawar had earlier said he would file a defamation suit against Hazare over the allegations."

Well, Nidhi S Bhalla, of BlendiT, a smoothie bar at Kakkanad, which specialises in providing healthy drinks, might have a solution.Her Detox Plan, aimed at flushing off the toxins which you have consumed in the year gone, can be a good step in this direction. It was a year ago that Nidhi came up with BlendiT, an unheard-of concept, of healthy smoothies. Over the year, she has added detox water and floral detox tea to her list.Detox PlanBlendiTs Detox Plan is a three-day pack. The first day includes having two smoothies, two detox water and one booster shot. There will be a green as well as a sunshine smoothie.Green vegetables are used to make the green smoothie, which is also called the Green Monster. Leafy vegetables, like spinach, cucumber and wheatgrass, are the main ingredients, says Nidhi.The ingredients are washed in water, vinegar and turmeric to cleanse it before being made a smoothie. We give smoothies, without adding sugar or water. But, it is customised. If the client wants it with bananas and dates, we make it accordingly, she says. The three- day package is made of fresh fruits or vegetables, without any preservatives, and are delivered fresh to your doorstep each day.Green smoothies are consumed at night, while sunshine smoothies, made of fruits, like watermelon, papaya and carrots are meant to be consumed during the day.

The second day includes two detox water, a floral tea mix and two smoothies.Detox water flushes out all the toxins from your body and keeps one hydrated.

He is restricted to the hospital ward and officers are visiting him every two hours to find out how he is doing. He has also been isolated from the rest of the inmates. This more or less sums up a day -- every day -- now in the life of Rose Valley chairman Gautam Kundu, who is behind the bars at Presidency jail.He has been in jail since March 2015, but has never been put under such security.Kundu is at the centre of a scam that is being investigated by CBI and ED. It has witnessed heightened activity and has shot to the headlines especially after December 30 when Trinamool MP Tapas Pal was arrested and January 3 when the same partys leader in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay was taken into custody by CBI.The quantum of funds involved in the Rose Valley scam is more than Rs 15,000 crore and some estimates put it at Rs 17,000 crore, a figure six times more than the Rs 2,500 crore figure of Saradha scam.Jail authorities fear that Kundu, who is the sole owner of that chit fund empire, may face attacks by a section of inmates who are pro-Trinamool Congress. The heightened security arrangements were put in place on January 3 when Bandopadhyay was arrested by CBI triggering widespread protests by his party and angry reaction by the chief minister.Kundu took over the reins of the group after his elder brother Kajal, who, along with his wife and son, were killed in an accident on their way to Guwahati from Agartala in 2003. Kajal Kundu established the company is 1997 after selling insurance products for more than a decade.Gautam Kundu is lodged in the jails hospital ward. Two warders are keeping a watch over him 24 hours a day. Jail officers visit him every two hours. No one apart from doctors, male nurses and jail officials are allowed to enter the hospital ward, said a senior jail department official.Every two hours, a senior jail officer visits him and talks to him in the ward to make sure everything is under control.There is a chance that a section of inmates who are outraged by the arrest of the ruling party MPs may attack Kundu. This level of security has not even been provided even to American Center attack mastermind Aftab Ansari and IS operative Muhammed Mussa who are lodged in Alipore central jail, said an officer.Kundu is suffering from a severe case of piles, apart from high blood pressure and sugar. He has been in the hospital ward of the jail for a long time.The jail authorities have decided to appeal to a medical board at SSKM for help. Doctors will be asked to visit the jail to check him instead of sending him to the hospital. Significantly, former minister Madan Mitra, who was in jail for his involvement in the Saradha scam, spent several months at a SSKM cabin.Jail sources said Kundu expressed surprise after the arrest of the Trinamool Congress MPs. He has also said that the leaders of various political parties were equally close to him. A section of his employees has allegedly usurped substantial amounts of money after an investigation was launched against the chit fund.The jail authorities have also asked Kundu not to move out of the hospital ward. Now, Kundu spends time staring at the flat screen television set in the hospital, apart from reading newspapers. Sometimes, he prays before a statue of a goddess kept in one corner of the ward.He (Kundu) keeps mostly to himself but is watching television a lot after the arrest of the Trinamool Congress MPs. The only time he gets out of the ward is to make calls from the telephone booth inside the jail premises. The two warders follow him wherever he goes, said an officer of Presidency jail.In keeping with procedures, Kundu can call three numbers  among them are his lawyer and relatives. Sources said he communicates regularly with them.He follows a strict diet, prescribed by doctors, which includes chapatis, vegetables, fruits and egg white. Given his love of bright colours, he still wears colouful shirts and track pants in the ward."

I am at present consulting my lawyer and will file both criminal and defamation suits against him. I dont know from where he got the figure of Rs25,000 crore. Hazare, though a social worker, cannot defame anyone and everyone.The petitions alleged that the fraud had been committed in governance by first burdening sugar cooperative factories with debts and thereafter selling these sick units at a throwaway price, causing loss of Rs25,000 crore to the government, cooperative sector and people.Pawar clarified, In all the cases, tenders were floated as per the procedure several times. Moreover, the alleged scam took place when I was a minister at the Centre and not connected to decisions taken by the state goovernment.Pawar also said there was no need to spend Rs3,600 crore on the Shivaji memorial. We are not questioning the greatness of Shivaji, though there was no need to spend so much money on a third statue. He added it was his government who had approved the statue but could not compete it due to a lower budget.Gujarat pattern of budget announcementWith the announcement of elections in five states, the question of violation of code of conduct guidelines by declaring Union Budget has cropped up. Pawar said, The Budget will anyways be over in four to five days from January 31 to first week of February. In our time, Budget discussions and approvals used to take a minimum of 22 days. I have heard it merely takes three to four days in Gujarat and I can see the same pattern replicated in the Budget.On Shiv SenaSeconding Uddhav Thackerays views against releasing Budget amidst elections, Pawar said a decision whether to join hands with the Shiv Sena on the issue will be taken after a discussion with his party members. Thackeray said the opposition should come along with the Sena to demand a cancellation of the budget as it may influence voters. Pawar said, Uddhavs statement reflects that our opposition is agreeing with our way of thinking. The Sena and BJP have come together only for power.On demonetisationPawar claimed that although the Centre has performed the surgery, the after-care was botched up. Fifty days are over but there is no change in the situation. Farmers have stopped getting loans as the co-operative banks have suffered. The real estate is affected. The growth of various sectors is affected due to demonetisation which will also affect our GDP.ReadDemonetisation failed to check black money, rural economy collapsed, says Pawar"

It is a condition in which, the pancreas, an organ located near the stomach, does not produce enough insulin, leading to uncontrolled sugar levels in the body.Although Gandhi recovered in a couple of days, he said that over the years, the ordeal of daily insulin jabs, blurry vision and weight gain has been a traumatizing experience. What is surprising is that I have no family history of diabetes. My condition continued to deteriorate after going into coma, said Gandhi.He added, My body was retaining excess water and my weight increased from the usual 82 kilogram to 105 kilogram.While Gandhi was put on dialysis, the doctors treating him said that over the years, the diabetes had let to the failure of both his kidneys. The sugar level in his blood fluctuated uncontrollably which damaged his kidneys. It also led to retinopathy which made his vision blurry, said Dr Bharat Shah, consultant nephrologist, Global Hospital, Parel. His mother turned out to be a match and donated one of her kidneys, added the doctor.Gandhi underwent a kidney transplant on December 26, and was registered for pancreatic transplant two weeks before that. Doctors said that in his case, a pancreatic transplant is required urgently to prevent damage to his new kidney.In type one diabetes patients, a pancreatic transplant is required along with the kidney transplant. The new pancreas will produce insulin immediately and will control his sugar levels. With this, the complications related to diabetes will be solved, said Dr Somnath Chattopadhyay, consultant, hepato pancreato biliary and transplant surgery. He added that so far, only one such transplant has been done in Maharashtra.While there have been donations in the last two weeks, the doctors have not found a suitable organ yet. On December 22, we received the pancreas of a brain-dead patient for a transplant. But, on further examination, the organ was found unfit for the procedure, the doctor added.Meanwhile, as Gandhi recuperates in the Intensive Care Unit at Global Hospital, Parel, he prays that he finds a donor soon. Every day, I wait for one call, telling me that there is a donor available, he said.READ MOREWhy Mumbai, Delhi dont have a healthy rate of heart transplants"

In other words, humanism and universalism is what true Punjabiat means to me. And none other than Baba Nanak is its icon that symbolises this sentiment the best. Though I have to cross the Wagha border  created by the Punjabis themselves  showing my British passport, but in my mindscape there is no border. I am Mantos lunatic from Toba Tek Singh and I never reconciled with the division of the Punjab.I exist in Punjabi and Ill die in it. I dream, think and feel in Punjabi. It is my last refuge against all odds. As my children dont speak it, itll die with me. The poem Lasan was written while I was flying back to Vancouver from California in 1988. There I had come across the word Lasan written in the Punjabi script on a huge billboard meant for woman farm workers, migrants from the Punjab. For a moment the taste of the word Lasanwas like a lump of sugar on my tongue. The poem is a lament about the loss of language, though it is very much happening now in our own homeland. My first visit to Punjab was in 1997. It was the most exciting and creative period in my life. It is the only place where I feel at home.My disappointments with the present-day Punjab are many. The rot has set in. I will not repeat the situation we all are too familiar with. Politics and culture aside, my main concern is the complete degeneration of Punjabi language at the hands of university academia and journalists. However, as Ghalib said one can have thousand wishes worth dying for. My only hope and dream is the reunification of our Punjab. I know well the hard reality that it now seems impossible. We are the cursed people of the cursed land. But I still dream. Counting starts from zero.(As told to Nirupama Dutt)"
58d93386a3d24b224f243130,Maharashtra Politics to Battle Ghosts of 2016 This Year,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-politics-to-battle-ghosts-of-2016-this-year/story-WTeqWSzTtxF5jBaVg5b9ZJ.html,2017-01-03,"The Marathas, used to dominating Maharashtras politics, unprecedentedly took to the streets. Protests from the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Dalits and Muslims became more vociferous. Devendra Fadnavis was under constant covert scrutiny as only the second Brahmin CM of Maharashtra.The resignation of a senior minister and the imprisonment of a former minister on corruption charges triggered loud voices of protests that drowned questions whether the graft allegations were valid.All in all, the year that went by brought to the fore the fissures in Maharashtras social and political fabric.This one year has set Maharashtra back by at least 50 years as far as social reform goes, says Surendra Jondhale, head of Mumbai Universitys department of civic and politics. Elaborating, he pointed out that Maharashtras social leaders always used to critique their own communities even as they strove for development. But this time, communities chose to press their demands by targeting each other. It is a great setback to Maharashtras legacy, Jondhale said.The fault lines could further deepen and widen in 2017 as political parties ratchet up social tensions further ahead of polls to major municipal corporations and zilla parishads.The Maratha protests, though without party affiliation on the surface, drew massive support from Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) heavyweights wary of losing their votebank to the BJP.The protests were for reservation in government jobs and education and changes to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which sections of Marathas felt was being misused to target them. But, with Maratha politicians across parties showing solidarity, the protests also came to be seen as a response to the perceived sidelining of the community in decision-making and power structures. Some pointed to the BJP-led governments systematic attempt to break down existing power structures of cooperative banks and sugar cooperatives. Others to the dwindling political representation of the Maratha community, comprising 32 percent of the states population, in the government, with a Brahmin chief minister and less than 50 per cent of the cabinet comprising Maratha leaders, against the historical average of 60 per cent.Moving to the OBCs, the resignation of Eknath Khadse as revenue minister for alleged irregularities in the purchase of a Pune plot was painted by some within the BJP itself as a move against the coomunity. Khadse, mentored by the late BJP stalwart Gopinath Munde, was from the Leva Patil community and one of the BJP leaders in the state with a mass base, especially in North Maharashtra.After Mundes death, though his daughter Pankaja is in politics and in the government, the mantle of OBC leadership among senior leaders was passed on to Khadse. Some of us were definitely worried about the caste ramifications of his resignation, a senior BJP leader said.The social polarisation got graver as members of the Dalit and OBC communities joined hands to protest too, insisting that their share of reservation should not be touched while accommodating the Marathas demands.As the OBCs consolidated, several such protests turned into a show of strength in support of jailed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Chhagan Bhujbal, an OBC leader, with Mundes supporters also walking along. They alleged that Bhujbal was imprisoned on trumped-up charges and this would never have happened if Munde had been alive.The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen too jumped into the fray, joining the Dalits and OBCs, and demanded that the government work towards setting aside quotas for Muslims if it can consider the same for Marathas.Besides political machinations, adding to the social tensions was the agrarian crisis in Marathwada, parts of Vidarbha and Khandesh that deepened in 2016, first with a dry spell and then excessive rain, causing massive crop losses and ballooning debts. It was instrumental in pushing the distressed farmers and agricultural labourers, many from the Maratha community in Marathwada, to pour their anguish on the streets.Senior Congress leader Manikrao Thakre said, The farmer was the biggest political victim of 2016. Just coming out of a drought, he had to face losses from excessive rainfall and then plummeting prices of his produce due to demonetisation.By the end of the year, however, Fadnavis and the BJP had managed to navigate through these fraught situations, including constant pinpricks from ally Shiv Sena, and emerge clear leader in municipal council polls across the state. The Shiv Senas MP Sanjay Raut, has, however, that alleged misuse of administrative resources was behind the BJPs success.Matters look set to remain fraught in the coming year as 10 major municipal corporations, including Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Nagpur, and zilla parishads and panchayat samitis in more than 20 districts go to polls. The impact of the social polarisation will play out more clearly in rural elections, and we will have to wait and watch how it alters the political scenario in Maharashtra, Jondhale said.READ MOREUddhavs reply to CM jibe: BMC among cleanest civic bodies in IndiaMaharashtra govt to get its hawker policy ready before pollsWhat 2017 means for parties in Maharashtra"

The climate too was not conducive to the crop this time, the experts said.He invested around Rs 8,000 per acre, after having tough time raising the required money for the paying wages to workers. Seeds and pesticides were already stocked before demonetisation. It has been a long practice to cultivate black gram immediately after harvesting of paddy in various parts of the State. I did not get the expected yield in paddy, which I had cultivated earlier. It was just 27 bags (75 kg per bag) per acre instead of usual 34-36 bags, he said.As the practice has been in the region for long, the tenant farmer has to pay to the landowner 18 bags per acre. That left Murali with not enough to cover the investment on the first crop, so he was banking on the second short crop - black gram.That is the story of all the farmers who went for black gram, said M Srinivasa Rao, who cultivated eight acres of the crop. We all used best seed. Last year, the seed had yielded seven bags per acre instead of usual four bags, he said. Rao had his fields immediately cleared of the wasted crop and cultivated them afresh with sugarcane, a one year crop. I am hopeful of recouping losses next year, he said.(Subhead) Who cares for the small farmer?Of the 800-and-odd acres in Uppaluru village and nearby hamlets, black gram was cultivated in 600 acres. Around 70 per cent of those lands were tilled by tenant farmers, who were forced to take loans from private money lenders with no banks interested to lend them. Of the 4,700 LEC (Loan Eligibility Card) holders, only 415 availed loans.M Chanti Babu, another farmer who too suffered cultivating black gram said they do not understand as to what went wrong. We did what we have been doing since ages, he said. There has been a demand from the farmers who cultivated black gram, but lost it due to viral infestation, that it is time for the State government to intervene and come to their aid.Buoyed by the remunerative price they got last year, farmers cultivate more area with black gram this year. As against 3.91 lakh hectares in 2015-16 rabi season, 4.04 lakh hectares were cultivated for the current rabi (2016-17). In Krishna district alone, the crop was cultivated in 1,56,724 hectares.The viral infestation was unusual this year and when the department was appraised of the infestation, we suggested some remedies, but it has been too late for some 25,000 hectares crop in Krishna district and another 5,000 hectares in Guntur and West Godavari districts, Agriculture department director K Dhanunjaya Reddy said.He said agriculture experts from Pune were called in for suggesting remedial measures to ensure the viral infestation does not spread to other parts of the State. As per those who lost the crop, we took up the matter with Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu. On his directions, measures are being taken to enumerate the crop loss, there after compensation would be decided, he explained."

About 60 per cent of the people in cities have Metabolic Syndrome and are clueless about it, says Dr H V Shivaram, a chief surgeon in gastrointestinal and bariatric surgery at CMI Aster.Dr Anusuya Shetty, who is a chief physician and a diabetologist at Apollo Clinic, pegs the prevalence at a much lesser (but still alarming) scale of 40 percent among the adults. But she adds that she has observed a striking increase in the past two decades.What Does it Mean?International Diabetes Foundation describes Metabolic Syndrome as the grouping of hazardous health indicators such as high sugar-level, high blood-pressure and abdominal fat, which raises the risk of diabetes and stroke. Almost all overweight or obese individuals have the Metabolic Syndrome.Dr Srinivasa P Munigoti, consultant diabetologist and endocrinologist at Fortis Hospital, says, One in every five adults is at high risk of this syndrome.Urban ConditionFrequent night shifts and sleep disturbances along with unhealthy lifestyles contribute to this condition.A 27-year-old female, working as a senior executive in an IT company, complained of continuous fatigue for over three months and sleepless nights. She had observed weight gain and had also felt a burning sensation in her hands and feet. After a thorough medical examination, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome that put her at risk for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was informed of the syndrome and lifestyle modifications to make.In a similar instance, a 42-year-old software engineer, whose BMI was 33, had a sedentary desk job. With parents who have a history of diabetes and early heart disease, he was more at risk. He was diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome with high blood pressure and cholesterol. Immediately he made necessary lifestyle changes such as reducing intake of carbohydrates and fat, quitting smoking and taking a brisk walk every day for an hour.Fat is not healthyIf the syndrome is not checked in time, then there is a risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.Dr Shivaram blames the Indian culture for glorifying fat. Everybody wants their child to be chubby and have the wrong notion that fat is healthy, he says. They realise that being overweight is an issue only when they develop diabetes or when they come of marriageable age.There is no comprehensive survey or data focusing on the syndrome. The doctors have witnessed the increase based on their experiences and reports of the annual health checkup. He alleges that awareness of the syndrome even among medical professionals is very less. It is not taught about in medical colleges. It is a fairly new disease, he says.When to Watch OutBody Mass Index for Indians should be 24. If it is between 24 and 30 then the person is overweight and if the BMI is more than 30 then the person is obese and most likely has Metabolic Syndrome, says Dr Shivaram.The chances of developing the syndrome increases with age, says Dr Ajith, general physician from Anand Diagnostic Laboratory. Males and females in the age group of 40 to 59 are three times more likely to develop it compared to those in the age group of 20 to 39 years.Even children are at risk. Increasing prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome has been reported in urban children and young adults, particularly in post pubertal girls, says Dr Sujay, pathologist and technical director of the Anand Diagnostic Laboratory.30 per cent of Indian children and adolescents exhibit symptoms of the syndrome. You should keep a watch on children above 10 years, he adds."

He said this while addressing the gathering after inaugurating a tribal convention, organised by the Social Welfare and Backward Classes department at the Dasara Exhibition grounds here. The CM said that he has instructed deputy commissioners of respective districts to clear the pending applications of the tribals.He called upon the tribals to provide education to their children so that they could join the mainstream of the society. Without education, it is not possible for the communities to attain development and achieve social, economic status in the society. There is a demand for upgrading the Ashrama Schools to PU colleges, and it will be reviewed. To encourage tribal people to pursue education, the state government has been issuing pension to educated unemployed youths of Koraga and Jenu Kuruba communities, he said.On the occasion, cash prizes of Rs 2,000, Rs 2,500, Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,500 were distributed to students, who have completed SSLC, PUC, degree and post-graduation respectively in the academic year 2016-17. Highlighting the Special Component Plan (SCP) and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP), the CM said, the funds under the schemes are allocated on the basis of population, and 24.1% funds have been reserved for SC/ST communities. In 2016-17, of Rs 85 crore under the scheme, Rs 19.542 crore has been spent on SC/STs.Siddaramaiah said, the state government will increase the quantity of rice being distributed to BPL families under Anna Bhagya from April 1. He issued sanction letters and other benefits to the beneficiaries on the occasion. Siddaramaiah said, the state government has been providing rice, edible oil, ghee, salt, eggs, sugar and nutritious food under various schemes to a select tribals and the scheme has been extended to the tribals in Chikkamagaluru district.Social Welfare Minister H Anjaneya said, forest personnel are creating problems for tribals, who reside inside the forest, and urged Forest Minister B Ramanath Rai, who was present in the event, to take measures to protect the interest of the tribals. Rai assured to look into the issue.Tribals seek internal reservationKarnataka State Lamps Cooperative Federation president M Krishnaiah urged the CM and other ministers to provide internal reservation for tribals to achieve political, social and economic equality.Madegowda, a PhD holder from Soliga community, said, even though he has earned a PhD degree, he is struggling to get jobs in universities and thus the government should provide internal reservation in employment."

Under non-plan expenditure, the government would earmark funds for salaries, subsidies, loans and interest, whereas plan expenditure was allocated for developmental projects and capacity building, areas likely to bring in returns later.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe objective of the reform is to curtail wasteful expenditure and inculcate greater fiscal discipline, said Fadnavis. Fiscal prudence is specially important for Maharashtra, with a whopping Rs 3.25-lakh-crore debt. Fadnavis had discussed the issue with the NITI Aayog during a meeting in Delhi. The Centre formally decided to merge the plan and non-plan expenditures last September.The matter had been conveyed to state governments. Maharashtras budget in 2016-17 was Rs 2.57 lakh crore. At successive meetings in the past two years, Fadnaviss directive was that the increasing non-plan budget was detrimental for the growth and development of Maharashtra, as it indirectly shrinks capital investments. The state finance departments projection of capital investment for the year 2016-17 was Rs 32,000 crore. A year ago (2015-16), it was Rs 28,000 crore.The states Gross Development Product last year was 8 per cent.Describing the Centres Budget as path-breaking and addressing concerns of the poor, middle-class and farmers, Fadnavis said, Higher allocations in infrastructure, agriculture and housing sectors would lead to inclusive growth.Maharashtra has had positive takeaways from the Budget, he said, in the form of increased work on farm ponds  from 5 lakh to 15 lakh  under MGNREGA. The state, which has 24,000 drought-prone villages, has the largest demand from farmers for farm ponds.In less than a year, the total number of applications for farm ponds in Maharashtra has crossed one lakh and is still rising, the CM said. The decision to include a separate textile policy with employment and investments could work to the states advantage in bridging the rural-urban divide, said Fadnavis, whose government has already given its nod to set up 11 textile parks, mainly in Vidarbha, Marathawada and parts of North and Western Maharashtra. The farm-to-fashion policy of the Centre is also being pursued by Maharashtra.Jaitleys decision to set up a Rs 5,000-crore corpus fund for micro irrigation has been welcomed by the state.Fadnavis said, In Maharashtra, we have declared that water be treated as essential commodity. Drip irrigation, which was confined to 3 lakh hectares of sugar cane crop, is being extended to all crops to double their productivity with lesser investment.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58dbd750a3d24b6ac1ef7f19,India generally cooperated with UN sanctions on Iran: Report,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-generally-cooperated-with-un-sanctions-on-iran-report-4512014/,2017-02-07,"India cooperated with multilateral efforts to use United Nations-mandated sanctions to achieve a nuclear agreement with Iran, a bipartisan Congressional report has said as the Trump Administration gears up to muster international support against Tehran. The independent Congressional Research Service (CRS), in its latest report, said that India began reducing economic relations with Iran in 2010 when Indias central bank ceased using a Tehran-based regional body, the Asian Clearing Union, to handle transactions with Iran. India implemented UN-mandated sanctions against Iran and generally cooperated with multilateral efforts to use sanctions to achieve a nuclear agreement with Iran, the report which was presented to lawmakers on Monday said.CRS is the independent research wing of the US Congress which prepares periodic reports on issues of interest forlawmakers for them to make informed decisions. These reports, however, are not considered as official reports of the US Congress.Watch what else is making newsIn its 42-page report, CRS notes that during 2010-2016 Indias private sector described Iran as a controversialmarket, a term used by many international firms to describe markets that entail reputational and financial risks.In January 2012, Iran agreed to accept Indias local currency rupee to settle 45 per cent of its oil sales to India, which Iran mostly used to buy Indian wheat, pharmaceuticals, rice, sugar, soybeans, auto parts and otherproducts. India reduced its imports of Iranian oil substantially after 2011  by the time of the Joint Plan of Action (JPA), Iran was only supplying about six per cent of Indias oil imports, down from over 16 per cent in 2008. India incurred significant costs to retrofit refineries that were handling Iranian crude. However, since the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), oil imports have apparently increased to close to 2011 levels, the report states.Indian firms ended or slowed work on investments in Iranian oil and gas fields, work that is likely to resume nowthat sanctions have been lifted, CRS said. It added that India and Iran are considering using Turkeys Halkbank to transfer to Iran $6.5 billion for oil purchased by India during 2012-2016.In 2015, India and Iran agreed that India would help develop Irans Chahbahar port that would enable it to tradewith Afghanistan unimpeded by Pakistan. With sanctions on Iran now lifted, that project no longer entails risk to Indian firms involved. In May 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Iran and signed an agreement to invest $500 million to develop the port and related infrastructure, CRS said. The report also said one test of Pakistans compliance with sanctions was a pipeline project that would carry Iranian gas to Pakistan  a project that US officials on several occasions stated would be subject to sanctions under the Iran Sanctions Act. Despite that threat, agreement on the $7 billion project was finalised on June 12, 2010, and construction was formally inaugurated in a ceremony attended by the Presidents of both countries on March 11, 2013, it said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Conducted by the Bengaluru-based Agricultural Development and Rural Transformation Centre at the Institute for Social and Economic Change, the study also revealed that neem-coated urea increases yield of paddy by 5.79%; sugarcane by 17.5%; maize by 7.14%; soybean by 7.14%; and tur/red gram by 16.88%.The study was aimed at finding how the Centres decision to make sale of neem-coated urea 100% mandatory has impacted crops since December 2015. The Centres move was to stop subsidised fertilizers being diverted to non-agriculture purposes like plywood/particle board making and textiles. The study found that neem-quoted urea has brought down the diversion, while also reducing the amount of fertiliser used in farming. Use of urea came down from 152 kg per hectare crop in 2014-15 to 149 kg in 2015-16, but the yield jumped from 2,028 kg per hectare in 2014-15 to 2,042 kg in 2015-16.Out of the estimated 30 million tonne annual domestic demand, 24 million tonnes of urea has been produced at home and the rest imported. Neem-coated urea is consumed less since, unlike normal urea, its conversion to nitrate is slow. Neem-coated urea releases nitrogen slowly and prolongs the ureas action to keep the plants greener for long.Farmers mostly use urea when the plants turn yellow, an official said. The neem-coated variety is applied in smaller amount since the plants stay greener for long. This means the amount of fertilizer is significantly lower.With complaints that excessive urea affects soil health, encouraging use of neem-coated urea improves both the soil health and yield, the official added."

The state is now getting 14.25 lakh tonnes annually.After the meeting, Paswan tweeted a photo of him standing with Pinarayi. But he termed the Kerala CM as O Paneerselvam. However, Pinarayi took the episode lightheartedly. Pinarayi asked the Centre to extend the rice procurement period for three months. Having rolled out the National Food Security Act in November 2016, Kerala needs higher allocation from the Centre.Kerala CM has placed several demands in front of us. One is increasing foodgrain allocation under NFSA, Paswan told reporters. Pinarayi also demanded more subsidy as the state wanted to give subsidised sugar under the PDS. At present, subsidised sugar is supplied only to BPL families. The state has also asked for paraboiled rice and additional foodgrain allocation of about 50,000 tonnes per month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the state. It has also sought Central support to make extra payment to state-run FCI labourers.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here Monday his government is planning to hold another all-party meeting to resolve the BJP-RSS violence in Kannur.We had called an all-party meet earlier to ensure peace. We are planning to convene one such meeting again, he said.In Delhi to fulfil a wish list from the Centre, Vijayan met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discussed Keralas ration issue and other pending projects, including the airports and an AIIMS.While trying to play down the protests over the Kannur killings, Vijayan said the RSS too must refrain from political violence in the state before campaigning against it at the national level. If the RSS is campaigning against violent politics, it must also refrain from all sorts of violent politics. The government does not support any kind of violence. We are taking necessary steps to maintain peace, he said.On a two-day visit to Delhi, Vijayan made light of the BJPs threat to impose Presidents rule in Kerala. He said a lot has changed in the country since the state government was dismissed in 1959 by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Such threats will not affect us. The state government was once dismissed in 1959. Since then, a lot has changed. The BJP needs to understand that, said Vijayan.His statement came following Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu last week warning the LDF Government of serious consequences if it continued to unleash political violence on its rivals."

It promises to acquire 1 lakh acres of land abroad  including the US and Canada  to settle Punjabi farmers, and also to financially assist students eager to study abroad.Closer home, it promises waiver of loans for small farmers. It says that if the party again forms the government, it will give Rs 100 per quintal on wheat and paddy as fertiliser input incentive in addition to the minimum support price (MSP). This, if implemented, will put an additional burden of Rs 2,700 crore on the state exchequer, calculated as per the most recent procurement  106 lakh tonnes of wheat and 165 lakh tonnes of paddy. The manifesto adds to the free-power dole too, promising 10-hour supply during the day. Already, the Parkash Singh Badal-led SAD-BJP government is giving a Rs 6,000 crore annual power subsidy to farmers.From two-wheelers to girl students and Rs 10 per kg sugar, to 35 lakh beneficiaries of the subsidised atta-dal scheme, to bringing general-category poor, marginal farmers and farm labour also under the ambit of a Rs 51,000 shagun scheme, the SAD has showered freebies on all key sectors.The 52-page manifesto that deputy chief minister and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal released, comes after the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have already released theirs.It promises to help 50,000 young persons buy taxis at zero down payment, besides incentives to industrialists, women, the elderly, small and medium enterprises, traders, and ex-servicemen.As there are 29 lakh voters  17.44 lakh male and 11.56 lakh females  in the 18-25 age bracket, the SAD has promised 20 lakh jobs in the government and private sectors by training 10 lakh youth in 2,500 skill centres.Further, the manifesto having pictures of the SAD symbol scales and Sukhbir behind his father and chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, reiterates that Badal has declared that as long as he is alive, he will not allow SYL (Sutlej-Yamuna Link) canal to be built.As for the land abroad, Sukhbir said, This will enable Punjabis to secure permanent resident status in those countries."

From smartphones and jobs, to loan waivers, subsidised ghee, sugar and tea leaves, the voter is being enticed with freebies big and small.All this in a state that is reeling under a debt of Rs 1.25 lakh crore, and has no money to pay even its pensioners.Economist Sucha Singh Gill, who has still not received his pension for the month from Punjabi University, calls it competitive populism at its worst. There is no logic, no commitment, no ability and no planning in these promises. The manifestos are nothing but sheer propaganda. Remember, the state has empty pockets. Its borrowing to even pay the interest on its debt.But, in poll season, parties expect the voters to suspend disbelief. Congress, which had been crying foul at the doles given by the ruling SAD-BJP combine, kicked off its campaign with the mother of all freebies. The party promised 50 lakh 4G-enabled smartphones to the youth, plus one year of free data and calling.SMART BRIBE!Though SS Johl, chancellor of the Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, calls the scheme sheer bribery, over 30 lakh people have already registered for it. Meanwhile, the Congress has quietly tweaked the schemes timeline, saying the phones will be given over a period of five years with an allocation of Rs 4,000-5,000 crore. Sandeep Singh, a student from Behram village, calls it another political stunt on the lines of free laptops that the Akali Dal promised in 2012, but never delivered.Yet, clearly, the parties discount popular memory, and are intent on wooing the youth with promises of employment. As an early bird in the game of manifestos, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) promised to create 25 lakh jobs and 147 entrepreneurship and skill development centres in its youth manifesto released in July last.Perhaps inspired by this, Congress has promised jobs to one member of all the 55 lakh households in the state, failing which it will give the jobless youth a stipend of Rs 2,500 a month. Not to be outdone, deputy chief minister and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal has now promised to make Punjab a state of entrepreneurs by setting up 2,500 skill development centres to train youngsters who will then be provided loans of up to Rs 10 lakh by the Punjab State Cooperative Bank for setting up businesses. Why did the state government not take this step in the last 10 years? growls Gill, who doesnt see any scope for government jobs. As for loans, the banks are flush with funds. Why are the parties taking credit for it?GHEE, TEA & SUGARTheir eyes glued to the vote banks, all parties have promised to continue or even add to the existing list of doles. So, the farmers will continue to get free power. And the blue card holders will carry on enjoying the subsidised atta-dal, albeit with some tea, sugar and ghee thrown in for good measure.While the Congress has promised to add sugar and tea to this freebie, both BJP and Akali Dal have sworn to give ghee as well, 2 kg to be precise, at a mere Rs 25 a kg.Calling it one of the most absurd promises, Dr Johl quips: Why dont they promise masala and milk as well?The saying, aapke munh mein ghee shakkar finally rings true now, says Devinder Sharma, founder member of Kisan Ekta, a union of 65 farmers organisations, adding that he cant help but laugh at this theatre of absurd.Sharma is particularly piqued at the promise of loan waiver by the big three comprising SAD, Congress and AAP. Whom are they trying to fool? Had it been possible, wouldnt the Akali Dal have already done it? he asks.Sharma is equally dismissive about AAPs promise of giving farm labourers a compensation of Rs 10,000 for every month of loss of work. Where will they get the money from?KEY QUESTIONIts one question to which none of the parties has any concrete answer. But they are united in their enthusiasm for bolstering the existing doles. The shagun scheme launched by the ruling combine has received a thumbs up from both Congress and AAP, which have decided to increase the old-age and widow monthly pension from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000, and the shagun from Rs 15,000 to Rs 51,000. Needless to say, both BJP and Akalis have vowed to do the same.The parties are also on the same page when it comes to wooing Dalits. No one knows where the land will come from but both Congress and BJP have vowed to provide a free house or 5 marla land to homeless Dalits. Its ditto for AAP.Ruing that there is no economic basis to any of these promises, Dr Johl has just one piece of advice: Dont believe any party.It seems the parties are also united in their belief that promises are made to be broken."

The main rivals of the BJD are the BJD dissidents, and not the Congress or the BJP.There are 94 candidates in the fray for 24 Zilla Parishad zones in eight blocks. The BJP, which had been lying low with a lone ZP member, is hopeful of winning more seats this time round.The entry of Zilla Vikash Manch leader Raghav Mallick with thousands of his Dalit and tribal supporters in the BJP has brightened the partys prospects. However, the Congress campaign has been dull except in its stronghold at Itamati.Aama Odisha Party, led by Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, is riding high in Khandapara and Bhapur blocks giving sleepless nights to Khandapara MLA Anubhav Patnaik. BJD veteran Rameswar Satpathy, who won ZP seat thrice, has filed papers as an Independent and has embraced Aama Odisha Party, after being denied a ticket. He is a formidable force in Kantilo.Another BJD rebel, Surya Choudhury, has locked horns with Nayagarh MLA and Minister Arun Sahoos candidate Mitu Sahu in Odagaon block. Sahoo has carefully nurtured his constituency and has the capability to sway voters in his favour. But the bitterness among sugarcane farmers after his failure to reopen Nayagarh Sugar Factory has adversely affected his image. Interestingly, an engineer, a college student and wife of a college principal, all greenhorns, are in the fray.Daspalla MLA Purna Chandra Naik seems to be in a tight spot as villagers are reportedly not welcoming him in his home turf Daspalla, Nuagaoan and Gania blocks. Disillusioned as villagers are with the ruling BJD for lack of visible changes, it will not be a cakewalk for the party and its negative votes may go to the BJP and the Congress, according to poll observers."

But now, I think I found my Valentine. The Vellore Culinary Trail organised by KeyTerns and curated by Foodie From Madras took 20 enthusiastic foodies (and some self-confessed non-foodies) on a trip to Arcot and Vellorevia Kanchipuram.The trip began with a battle between biryani and thayir sadam  two comfort foods by which you can judge a person! But at the end of the trail we knew who would win. The team of 20 including youngsters and the young-at-heart, bonded over food within the first 30 minutes of the journey. We knew who liked or disliked what.Kanchipuram idli, biryani, makkanpeda and filter kaapiFirst stop was on a road side. No, not shop, but literally, the side of the road. Our organisers wanted us to experience the traditional Kanchipuram idli, due to time constraints we had to eat inside the bus. Nevertheless, that did not stop us from enjoying the kovil idli.While this is circular and cut into semi-circular pieces, the common somewhat-cylindrical idlis are called tumbler idlis.A tumbler is coated with ghee and the fermented dough with pepper and curry leaves are mixed together and steamed. The ghee is to ensure that the idli comes out in shape, explained Gowrishanker Siva aka GS, the Foodie From Madras.Like every Tam-bram, I like my breakfast with a steaming hot cup of filter kaapi. Only coffee to the rescue! The shop, as the name suggests, was started in Madhuranthagam, and the franchise on the Kanchipuram highway serves more than just coffee. Served in a brass davara-tumbler, the coffee, took me back to my Coimbatore days, where every other day I would take time out to have a cuppa at the famous Annapoorna Hotel, which too serves similarly.Breakfast done. Nap taken, we reach Arcot at noon. We stop the bus on the narrow road, much to the ire of the lorry and two-wheeler drivers. We were standing outside a small shop that claimed to have introduced the Nawabi sweet, Makkan Peda to the public. Made with 11 ingredients, it is a meal in itself! This shop is 185 years old and five generations of our family has been running this, beamed Sundaram Chettiar.Legend has it that his great-great grandfather, Govinda Chettiar was close to the Nawab of Arcot. When the Nawab invited him for lunch, he was served this sweet. He tried to replicate the sweet based on what he saw, because he couldnt decipher it based on taste. Initially, we added palkhova, dalda, raisins, and a few nuts, he shared.The 20 of us loved the sweet, forgetting for a moment that biryani was awaiting us.The non-vegetarians were surprised when Sundaram Chettiar announced that he had specially packed authentic Star biryani.The hotel opens at around 10 am and you get their biryani only if you are lucky, told Srinivasan from KeyTerns. And our group was lucky or what! Packed in Mandhara elai, the fragrance of the biryani stayed intact and two people were asked to share one packet as wait for it, this was round one!The real deal was set up at The Vellore Kitchen. I get turned off by the pungent masala smell from biryanis. But this was mild. Thats the specialty of Vellore biryani. People here like it mild, so we make them that way, said P Gokul Raj, proprietor of the hotel. The rice is half cooked and the dum (vegetables and spices) is added and then cooked for a while. The rice used here is Seeraga samba, which is heavier than the normal rice.Suddenly, the trail turned into a sweet walk. We roamed the streets of Vellore looking for the oldest hotels and shops selling sweets and biscuits. Imagine finding an authentic Rajasthani hotel in a place in South India, which was ruled by Nawabs. Talk about cultural diversity!Dilip Rawals family served the North Indian doctors from Christian Medical College, Vellore. Over years, they have been famous for their lassi.Double Malai Lassi, Badam Pista Lassi and Badam kheer are famous here. Students from VIT come here just to have that and it is filling, he said, and yes he was right. The lassi was thick and filled with malai that it was even hard for two people to complete a glass.

This disorder can lead to a number of serious complications, whether of the heart, nerves or eyes, and if diagnosed late or left untreated, the damage can be irrevocable, opined health experts at a conference here on Sunday.Inaugurating the conference on endocrine and diabetes update organised by Apollo Sugar Clinics, president of Endocrine Society of Odisha Prof PK Mishra said even as the specific causes of the disorder depend on the type of diabetes that one is diagnosed with, endocrinology focuses primarily on the endocrine organs or those organs that may cause hormone imbalance.Since diabetes is one of the leading disorders to plague our generation today, physicians need to improve knowledge and skills which would enable them to provide most effective and advanced diabetes care to patients, Prof Mishra said.CEO of Apollo Sugar Clinics Gagan Bhalla stressed on the improved treatment facilities to deal with increasing number of diabetes patients. He said several initiatives that focus on preventive healthcare have been designed to provide advanced standards of services and facilities for diabetes care.A recent clinical research conducted by Apollo Sugar in Bhubaneswar found that patients who were adherent to diet management programme for a period of three months or more found a significant improvement in their HbA1c and total cholesterol levels. This indicates that individuals can manage their diabetes better than ever before through continuous monitoring.Senior Endocrinologist and organising secretary of the conference Dr Sambit Das said diabetes and endocrine disorders are common in Odisha and it is quite a challenge to manage these disorders. Regular updates would help the consultants dealing with the disorders diagnose and manage this common menace, he said.On the occasion, Prof RJ Dash was felicitated with life time achievement award for his significant contribution to the field of endocrinology and diabetes. Among others, CEO Apollo Hospital (Odisha and Chhattisgarh) Sudhir Diggikar and Prof AK Baliarsingh also spoke."

The monsoon failure and low storage in reservoirs forced a ban on taking up sugarcane crops in Cauvery command area. This has reduced sugar cultivation by 80 percent in two years.Mandya district which produced 75 lakh tonnes of sugarcane catering to five sugar factories has no standing sugarcane crop now. The sugar cultivation area produced 45 lakh tonne in the district. While 5 lakh tonnes of sugarcane was used as seed, another 10 lakh tonne was used by local jaggery units.However, some farmers managed to save their crops by using irrigation pump sets. Some 10-15 per cent operational jaggery units have managed to get sugarcane from neighbouring Tumakuru and Hassan districts.The Mandya APMC which used to receive 80 truckloads of jaggery earlier, now receives less than five truckloads. The jaggery units employed 2-35 people for processing, harvesting, jaggery making and transportation are now closed with no signs of revival.In some places, the jaggery units that managed to buy sugarcane from neighbouring districts have no sufficient water to make jaggery. The depletion of the underground water table and dried up borewells have added to the existing problems. Meanwhile, prices of jaggery have shot up and they are likely to increase further during festivals later this year.The labourers who demanded Rs 400 per day for harvesting sugarcane are ready to work for `250. This stems from reduced cane production. Now they harvest paddy in Visveswaraya canal area (up to 32 km) only as the Cauvery water could not reach or save standing crops in tail ends in VC canal achukat. While the Chikkadevaraja canal was closed for renovation works.Krishna, a sugarcane grower, said each jaggery unit made an average of `6-7 lakh in a season. Drought and fall in reservoir levels have wiped out Rs 8-10 crore worth jaggery in the units that were spread in rural areas. He said the farmers have lost more than Rs 1,500 crores in a year as they have given up sugarcane cultivation and also lost paddy crops.KRRS leader Nanjunde Gowda said the jaggery units were a sign of prosperity in villages. With no source of income, the farmers have no option but to migrate or to dispose of their land. He fears the worsening economic condition of families would end up increasing in farmer suicides if the government fails to take concrete steps and if there are no pre-monsoon showers in a couple of weeks.Krishnaram, a teacher, said the number of women travelling by trains to Bengaluru and Mysuru has swelled in recent days as they have started working in semi-urban pockets to earn their bread and butter.He says that with lack of vision of policy-makers, failure to encourage agriculture-based industries and initiatives to generate employment locally, it would be difficult to check migration and tendency to commit suicides. The irrigation authorities failure to release water into irrigation canals has worsened drinking water scarcity in Mandya."

In his political career, he drifted from the Janata Dal (U) and the Janata Dal(S) before joining the Congress and held various portfolios as a Minister.After unsuccessfully contesting from Gundlupet Assembly constituency in 1985 and 1989, he had a winning streak from 1994 to 2013.Mr. Mahadeva Prasad fortified his status as a prominent leader in the region after his maiden electoral victory in 1994 when he trounced three-time MLA K. S. Nagaratnamma and never looked back despite shifting his loyalty from Janata Dal to Congress, which he joined in 2008 along with leaders such as M.P. Prakash.He held the portfolio of Food and Civil Supplies in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government led by N. Dharam Singh in 2004 and later held the Kannada and Culture portfolio in the JD(S)-BJP coalition government. The entry of Mr. Mahadeva Prasad into Congress helped galvanise the party in Chamarajanagar district as he had emerged as a prominent Lingayat leader in the belt and was responsible for strengthening it at the grassroots level as evident in the partys strong grip in local bodies. He also served as vice-president of Karnataka State Adult Education Council from 1990 to 1998 and was the Senate and Syndicate Member of the University of Mysore 1994 to 1999. He also headed various organisations involved in social services. Mr. Mahadeva Prasad is survived by his wife M.C.

The Sathanur reservoir, the only major reservoir in the district, could not feed water for canal irrigation in those years. Tiruvannamalai district is worst affected due to off-season rain.Tamil Nadu Vivasyaigal Sangam, a Left-leaning farmers association, held a demonstration last month demanding to declare Tiruvannamalai a drought-affected district. Sangam district president Balaraman said: If it is declared drought affected, the Centre may release more funds to compensate farmers. Loans might be waived and long-term measures to tackle such situation could be evolved.P.T.

The area under cultivation for the year also reflects the graveness of the situation. Just look at the paddy coverage. Our paddy area is roughly about 52,000 hectares. In 2016, the area was only around 7,000 hectares, of which only around 5,500 hectares is expected to get a reasonably good yield, said S. Kanagaraj, Joint Director of Agriculture.V.R. Muthu Peyandi, district committee member of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, said that even those who sowed paddy relying on well irrigation were on the verge of witnessing a crop failure.Since there was no rainfall, the groundwater is also not getting replenished. The water level in wells is going down by a foot every day. A farmer who sowed paddy in over four acres is now trying to protect at least one acre of crop, he said, adding that many farmers he interacted with were under psychological stress.N. Palanichamy, president of Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, said that even those who switched to millets, pulses and other crops hoping for a reasonable rainfall towards the end of the year were looking at an almost complete crop failure now.Though a considerable number of farmers had insured their crops under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, officials acknowledge that it was going to be tough to claim compensation due to stringent criteria. Though the scheme has some benefits over the previous one, the criteria for claims and verification process had been made little stringent and unrealistic, said an official.For instance, for all the paddy farmers in a firka to be compensated for prevented sowing, which means the farmers were not even able to sow due to climatic conditions, the scheme says that 75 per cent of the area should not be sowed, which is unrealistic, he said.Many of the farmers organisations have already stepped up their demand for declaring the district drought-hit.However, officials were unsure since the district may not technically fulfil the required criteria.An official from the Agriculture Department said that one of the criteria was that rainfall shortage should be 75 per cent.Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that the situation was being thoroughly studied and a report would be accordingly sent to the State government."

Suriyan, district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the Communist Party of India, pointed out that farmers have been subject to severe distress as the crops have withered.Farmers in the canal irrigated areas of the district have not been able to take up kuruvai cultivation over the past five years owing to failure of the Karnataka government to release water in the Cauvery river in time.They had gone in for the samba crop this year with hopes that Karnataka would comply with the Supreme Court directives.However, their hopes have been belied, he said.The cultivated area in the district has also come down drastically rendering many agricultural labourers jobless.Many farmers were also facing problems in raising cattle given the shortage of green fodder, he said.He demanded that farmers who could not raise any crop owing to the drought should be sanctioned a compensation of Rs. 30,000 an acre. Those who had cultivated should be given Rs. 35,000 an acre for paddy, Rs. 1 lakh an acre for banana and sugarcane and Rs. 50,000 an acre for other horticulture crops, he demanded.The State should recommend waiver of the crop loans sanctioned by nationalised banks.The government should also immediately stop sand mining on the Cauvery and Coleroon rivers, he said.President of the farmers wing of the Tamil Maanila Congress, Puliyur A.

Abhimanyu, at the pre -budget consultations held by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in New Delhi on Wednesday, said: Presenting budget in February under revenue and capital classification would facilitate the authorisation of expenditure by the time the new financial year begins.Haryana government is planning to emulate the Central government by presenting its budget on the basis of revenue and capital classification in February 2017 itself, he said.Capt.

Abhimanyu pointed out that all cooperative Sugar Mills in Haryana were running in losses and have negative net worth. The loss suffered by the sugar industry can be offset to some extent by laying emphasis on by-products, such as setting up of ethanol and co-generation plants, he said, adding that Centre should provide financial assistance in the form of interest-free loans or soft loans for setting up of ethanol and co-generation plants in the State to enable these sugar mills to improve their financial health."
58e4ad21a3d24b281b10129b,Sri Lanka’s next big fight,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Sri-Lanka%E2%80%99s-next-big-fight/article17007033.ece,2017-01-08,"The International Society of Nephrologists (ISN) recently honoured Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena for his extraordinary contribution to the fight against Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu).The recognition comes months after the World Health Organisation declared Sri Lanka malaria-free, a significant public health achievement in the region.Unlike in its fight against malaria, Sri Lanka has a peculiar challenge even as it tries combating CKDu  an unknown enemy. The medical fraternity has been grappling with the question for years now and is yet to establish a cause that has scientific evidence backing it, according to President of the Sri Lanka Association of Nephrologists, Chula Herath.Silent conditionWhile hypertension and diabetes are known to be common causes for kidney ailments, CKDu falls outside that ambit. In every renal data base in the world there is a percentage of CKDu which causes long-term progressive damage to the kidneys, he told The Hindu at Sri Lankas Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital. However, he clarifies that not all undiagnosed cases are CKDu, a specific term used to connote conditions where causal factors remain unknown. Describing it a largely silent condition, he says symptoms are seldom manifested till the final stages. It is like this  when you drive a car, you wont feel the petrol running out until the vehicle stops, unless you check periodically.CKDu was in the news some years ago when farmers working in Central Americas sugar cane farms succumbed to a mysterious kidney disease. In both Central America and Sri Lanka, reports of the condition first began emerging sometime in the 1990s, according to Dr. Herath. In 2014, Sri Lanka media widely reported on a mysterious kidney disease spreading among farmers. More recently, there are reports of the disease in some parts of Andhra Pradesh, among people from the agricultural community.In Sri Lanka too, it is the agriculture-intensive North Central Province where the condition is highly prevalent.Speaking at the award ceremony in Colombo in December, Mr. Sirisena said CKDu was endemic among poor farmers in Sri Lanka. He pointed to 20,828 patients and 5,000 deaths per year, terming it a national disaster.Mr. Sirisena, who served as Health Minister in former President Mahinda Rajpaksas cabinet, is from Polonnaruwa in the North Central Province, where agriculture is one of the key drivers of the economy. Given CKDus prevalence in his constituency, and his own familiarity with public health, he set up a presidential task force to address the problem.Additionally, he prompted Colombo-based entrepreneur and proprietor of the sea-side Galle Face Hotel Sanjeev Gardner to set up a fund to support initiatives aimed at curbing CKDu. The ISN-Gardiner Fund (ISN-GF) launched on the occasion would aim to fight CKDu not just in Sri Lanka but in the region and at the global level. Experts from the region, including senior Indian nephrologist Georgi Abraham, have been roped in to play a key role in the initiative.The focus, so far, has been largely on curative measures, Dr. Herath says, explaining that effective preventive measures could not be evolved without knowing what causes the condition. Dialysis and transplantation are the common medical responses, depending on a patients condition, but the countrys available medical infrastructure is overstrained with the increasing incidence of CKDu, he notes. Sri Lanka, after consistent efforts to strengthen its CKDu response mechanisms (COMMA) currently has nearly 400 dialysis machines. The country needs at least 1,000 in the coming year, by nephrologists estimation. About 350 live kidney transplants and 20 cadaveric kidney transplants are performed in Sri Lanka every year and both could increase, Dr. Herath notes.Preventive measuresWorking on prevention is not easy because nephrologists across the world have only assumptions to go by. There is a lot of hypothesis that agrochemicals and contaminated water could be likely causes. While we do not have evidence to prove this, the public health system is trying to intervene through some preventive measures, he said. Local government officials involved in the campaign now focus on providing good quality drinking water, raising awareness about the risk of dehydration and ensuring supervised use of agrochemicals and fertilisers.Given all the challenges, Sri Lanka has come a long way in responding to CKDu, doctors say.The Health Ministry has begun sensitising its officials in every district to the condition. We are also training our public health workers at the grass-roots level. Our public health infrastructure is gearing up in a big way, Dr. Ranasinghe says.meera.srinivasan@thehindu.co.inExperts from the region, including from India, have been roped in to play a key role in supporting initiatives aimed at curbing the disease"

He was of the opinion that the Centre should have made elaborate arrangements prior to the move.Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the State Sugarcane Growers Association, said prices of agriculture commodities had come down by 40 per cent owing to demonetisation and farmers were deprived of financial assistance from banks and other financial institutions. Mr. Shanthakumar said most farmers could not repay their loans owing to drought during the last few years, and banks had stopped giving fresh loans.He urged the government to instruct all nationalised and commercial banks to disperse fresh loans to farmers without insisting on repayment of previous loans.Chandrakanth, director, Institute for Social and Economic Change, G.S. Satya, journalist, and Chinnaswamy Vaddagere, progressive farmer, spoke. Farmer leaders Vasanth Kumar, Veeranagowa Patil, T.V. Gopinath, M.B. Chethan, Dev Kumar, Ramesh, and Shivakumar were present.

Wadnere, HR&CE Minister Sevur S. Ramachandran, Kalasapakkam MLA V. Panneerselvam and officials of different departments, visited fields in Polur, Kalasapakkam, Chengam and Thandarampattu blocks where crops have completely withered.They started their visit from the paddy field of R. Velusamy in Vasur village in Polur block. He owns seven acres and cultivated fine variety of paddy called Sri in four acres. What in six months would be a full blown crop was reduced to hay in just three months. The saplings he was raising for replanting in remaining three acres had also dried.Since this fine variety of paddy would be bought for good price, say Rs.1,700 a bag, I purchased seeds at Rs. 900 a kg in the market. I have pledged family jewellery and spent Rs. 1.75 lakh for the cultivation. I cannot start cultivation again even if it rains as I have no resource to go back to farming. All that I expect is the government to help me out, he said.S. Pichandi of Then Pallippattu village in Kalasapakkam block said all his 1.5 acres of Bapatla variety of paddy crop became dry in three months (while its maturity is at six months). Subramani, whose two acres of paddy crop of Bapatla had completely gone dry, was inconsolable. The same story repeated at the field of Panneer in Solavaram village in Kalasapakkam block where the crops stood testimony to worst drought. He told the team that his two acres of paddy, Bapatla again, had gone dry. Three acres of the same variety of paddy has gone dry in the field of Kasi in Karapattu village.People of this village said the encroachment of inlet of the village tank made the situation worse. K.N. Appasamy, a village elder, said the inlet was useful in taking the surplus water from the irrigation tank of nearby Mattavettu village. The team also visited dried sugarcane crop in Thullukuttipalayam in Thandarampattu block.District Collector Mr. Wadnere told the mediapersons ground truthing exercise was carried out in sample panchayats across the district so as to ascertain the state of major crops in the district.The findings of the exercise would be handed over to the government. Based on further instructions from the government, enumeration would be carried out and compensation awarded.When asked about the quantum of damage, Mr. Wadnere said they had just finished ground truthing. Enumeration would be carried out later. However with regard to paddy, he said that samba crops were cultivated in 33,820 hectares. Of them, 6,955 ha of crops had withered and 10,353 ha of crops were under the stress of drought. For other crops we need to assess. But the general observation is more than 50 per cent of all the crops cultivated is affected, Mr. Wadnere said. After field visit, Mr. Swain held a meeting to review the situation with officials."

Valarmathi led the team that included Rajeev Ranjan, Additional Chief Secretary, Highways and Minor Ports, P. Kumar and T. Rathinavel, MPs, and K. S. Palanisamy, Collector, and visited agricultural fields, both canal irrigated and rainfed, in Tiruchi district for a first-hand assessment of the situation.Withered maize and cotton fields greeted them at Tirupattur, a rainfed area. K.Ponnusamy, one of the farmers who had switched over to maize after a failed cotton crop last year, explained how his hopes were belied after an initial spell of rain prompted him to go in for maize.There has been no rain after that and the crops have completely withered now, he said. He had raised loans from private moneylenders in the village at an interest rate of 12 per cent. I have spent Rs.20,000 for an acre to raise the crop on the five acres. All is lost now and I am forced to take up work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, he said.Just opposite to his field, stunted cotton plants had left Annadurai of the village on the verge of penury. I raised the crop during the Adi pattam on 2.5 acres and the plants should stand chest high now with well formed clusters. But they have hardly grown to two feet now, he said.At S. Kannanur, a group of women made a fervent plea for urgent relief as they had spent all that they had to try and save the samba paddy crop. With no water flow in the Peruvalai canal, their main irrigation source, and failing borewells, the crop, though green still, have been stunted. Earlier, briefing media persons, Mr. Vellamandi Natarajan said that cultivation was taken up on only one third of the 3.81 lakh acres of cultivable lands in the district this year. But the crops have been badly hit due to monsoon failure. The team would make a complete assessment and submit a report to the government, he said.In Vellore, the teams will visit villages and study the damages to five crops  paddy, millets, cotton, pulses, and sugarcane. The survey will go on till January 9. They will upload the details and submit a report to the State government on January 9"

The bureau will scrap the use of wood-based paper made out of tree pulp for printing textbooks.A professor from Nagpur, Arvind Sovani, had filed a petition in the high court in October stating that the pulp paper used by Balbharati to publish textbooks was not eco-friendly and that they should be using more eco-friendly ways of printing text books.The court ordered Balbharati in November to stop the tender process and issue a fresh one for environment-friendly paper.Based on this court order, Balbharati decided to use agro-waste based pulp to make paper for printing nearly 10 crore text books. Sunil Magar , director of Balbharati stated, ""We have issued an all-India level tender to procure agro-waste based pulp paper. Textbooks, including the cover page of every book, will be printed using this paper following court orders.""Magar added that the bureau requires 30,000 tonnes of paper every year to print the textbooks. Balbharati has so far been using 'virgin pulp paper' for printing textbooks and Sovani, in his petition, stated that this paper was hazardous to the environment and not eco-friendly since it required cutting of trees.Considering the number of textbooks printed every year by Balbharati and the virgin paper used for printing, there was a lot of damage done to environment, Sovani said in the petition.

With rum getting an image make over in the global market, and its consumption witnessing an upswing in recent times, Mauritius has begun to market harder the top-not chrum it produces. The biggest potential market in India for Mauritianrum would be the armed forces stationed in Kashmir, and other cold weather combat zones of the country.Mookeswoor Choonee, former culture minister of Mauritius, told STOI on the sidelines of the Youth Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention here on Saturday: ""We produce the best rums in the world. We are exporting rum to France and the United Kingdom, we have now entered the US market. We want to increase our exports and are looking at India.""The island nation, which is a major source of foreign direct investment coming to India, has been waiting for talks to be revived with India on Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (CECPA) in order to put rum on the list of products that can be exported to India. Mauritius, which has swathes of sugarcane plantations, produces around 10 types of high quality rums. In fact, the Indian diaspora in Mauritius has been citing cultural roots to connect with India and thereby increase its share in the premium rum market. A majority of the Indian diaspora are descendants of Girmitiyas (indentured labour taken by British from India in the early 19th century).Choonee said: ""It is the Indianness that has made us strong in Mauritius. From being Girmitiyas earlier, we are now in key positions in government. If both the governments sign CECPA, Mauritian products will be added to the Indian market. Indian Army personnel could be potential bulk consumers for us, given the fact that they work in extreme cold conditions and rum would help them beat the chill. Our trade division has done the groundwork and we think it is high time the Indian government officially confirms it.""Choonee claims that Mauritian rum is a great hit among visiting Indian tourists. ""A few Bollywood actors, who have come for film shootings to Mauritius, have fallen in love with the country's rum,"" he claimed."

The 75-year-old, better known as Yaqub Mukhia, left Congress about two decades ago and joined the Samajwadi Party. He liked its founder Mulayam Singh Yadav (""garibon ka saathi""), canvassed for the party, acted as a polling agent, and when required, loaded buses and tractors with supporters to MSY rallies in nearby Muzaffarnagar and in faraway Lucknow.But that was then. In recent times, Yaqub has switched allegiance and become a firm supporter of, describing him ""as good as Charan Singh""  the founder of Lok Dal, from Baghpat, now his son Ajit Singh's constituency.Yaqub's isn't a solitary voice. For decades now, the former village head has been influencing Muslim votes in Tawli. Located 10km from Muzaffarnagar town, the village has a population of over 13,000. Many are Muslims. That he owns 120 bigha land further enhances his clout. ""Most of us listen to him,"" chorused a bunch of his associates sitting nearby.What Yaqub is to Tawli, Ainuddin is to Nirmani and Nooruddin Hassan is to Kabirpur. Ainuddin, now 80, is still known as Ainuddin sarpanch although he doesn't hold the post any more. And Nooruddin, 55, is a village mukhiya. They are also SP workers who command respect and votes in their community. They too joined the party impressed by Mulayam, campaigned for him and have now decided to bat for Akhilesh. They are not bothered whether a father-son rapprochement comes about. And they are not losing sleep over who gets the cycle symbol or whether it is frozen. ""Nishan rahe na rahe, hum to Akhilesh ke saath hain (symbol or no symbol, we are with Akhilesh,"" says Ainuddin, once ""a half-hearted"" CPI worker who was drawn to SP by the word 'Samajwadi' (socialist). ""Our village has around 1,500 Muslim voters. If there's a split, about 90% will vote for Akhilesh,"" Ainuddin said.Yaqub too estimates that at least 90% Muslims from his village will vote for Akhilesh. Incredibly, even Nooruddin offers the same figure. Who are the remaining 10% of Muslims likely to vote for? The answer is BSP, largely. Only a handful might vote for Congress  that's the general view.For the trio and others around them,today. Yaqub calls him 'vikas purush' (man of development); ironically, a sobriquet first given to his father by SP supporters. An associate reels out a list of ""achievements"" by Akhilesh: waiving loans, distributing laptops and phones, improving PDS, and increasing duration of electricity. ""And if you dial 108 from any village, the ambulance reaches immediately,"" Yaqub says. Adds Ainuddin, ""Usme kisi kism ka daag nahi hai (Akhilesh is blemish-less)."" Nooruddin sums up the mood, ""No CM has done as much as him.""Every political battle has its own cast of heroes and villains, going by the viewer's perception and prejudices. For senior party workers, Mulayam is a ""good"" leader who has allowed himself to be surrounded by ""unworthy"" friends and associates. ""Uske ghar mein chor aa gaye hain (there are thieves in his house now),"" says Yaqub. Ainuddin feels that the 77-year-old should make way for his deserving son. ""If a son is surging ahead, his father should just let him take the lead,"" he says.They all accept the analogy that the senior SP politician is like a great batsman past his prime, unwilling to hand over the captaincy to a dynamic youngster. ""We don't know about Etawah and other areas which are Mulayam's stronghold. But here in West UP, Muslims are firmly behind Akhilesh,"" says Ainuddin. His kinsmen nod in agreement."

The ACSIL is the oldest sugar industry in cooperative sector in the state.Considering all aspects, including the financial condition of the factory and the cost factor in sugar cane cultivation, the authorities decided to increase the sugar cane price, said Saroj Mishra, ADM-cum-managing director of the ACSIL.Mishra said the sugar factory is providing a rate more than the minimum support price (MSP) of the sugar cane fixed by the government. The government has fixed the MSP of the sugar cane at Rs 2,300 per tonne. The price of the sugar cane was decided in the board meeting of the factory, said Mishra.""Due to the increase in input costs, we demanded procurement price of Rs 3,000,"" said general secretary of Ganjam district sugarcane growers association Samira Pradhan.Sugar cane growers staged dharna in front of the factory on Saturday demanding increase in the procurement price. They lifted the dharna after president of the factory Bipin Bihari Patra convinced them that the factory is not in a position to increase the price.The area under sugar cane cultivation in the district has reduced drastically in last few years as the farmers have switched over to other crops. They realized that the sugar cane was no more a profit-making crop, said Narayan Jena, vice-president of the association. Around a decade ago, sugar cane used to be grown on 12,000-acres. It has reduced to 6,000 acres, he said.Meanwhile, processing of sugar cane is scheduled to start this week. The factory authorities have targeted to crush around 90,000 tonnes of sugar cane this year against the last year's achievement of 1.09 lakh tonnes, said cane manager of the factory Bhagaban Panda. ""We reduced the target this time because of the area under cultivation has come down,"" he said."

However, bureaucratic confusion had put the proposal on hold following fears that neera would be fermented and sold as toddy. But with coconut prices crashing in the recent times and many farmers contemplating switching over to other crops, the economics pertaining to neera was given a serious thought. At present, neera is being tapped and marketed as a natural drink by Kerala which has the largest coconut growing area in the country.""We want to replicate the Kerala model.

This will change the agriculture economy in the coconut growing areas,"" an official from the horticulture department said.Neera can be used as an ingredient in manufacturing jaggery, sugar, honey, chocolate, cake and cookies apart from being sold as a natural drink. Neera is reported to be good for treating urinary problems and diabetes.""Neera is already popular in the coastal districts of the state. We will have to start branding it in other areas.

""The government states that this would allow the poor to celebrate Pongal with joy, but unfortunately a section of Tamils have been discriminated against,"" he said.

Since sugarcane has an 18-month crop cycle, crop sown in early 2015 was ready for harvest in November 2016.So far, 32 of 147 mills have shut the crushing operation. Experts say more than 50% of the mills will stop functioning by mid-February--45 days before the usual cycle that ends in March. Most mills are situated in the sugarcane belt of Western Maharashtra and Marathwada . Most mills are facing a difficulty in functioning due to a dearth of the raw material sugarcane. Maharashtra is one of the largest producers of sugar in the country.This situation has hit sugarcane farmers as factories are unable to pay their bills in accordance with fair remunerative price (FRP) rules. This has further delayed farmers' loan repayment plans.""According to the business model on which these cooperative mills run, they need to be operational for at least 160 days to break even this year. But not many industries will be able to run for that long this year,"" said a senior official from the sugar mills association.Last year, a total of 178 factories were operational, this year 31 didn't even start operations.The area under sugarcane cultivation shrank to 6.3 lakh hectares in 2015-16 due to the drought from close to 10.3 lakh hectare the year before. Not only did the area reduce, productivity was also affected.So far, 26.5 lakh metric tonnes of sugar has been produced; the quantity at the same time last year was 33.7 lakh metric tonnes. Officials said the reduction will impact sugar prices as the year advances. While there is sufficient stock for now, as production dips further, the demand-supply gap with widen.""Sugar mills are luring farmers to sell sugarcane by promising a higher price. Hopefully, they are able to pay what they promise,"" said another official.Some mills have declared a price of Rs 2,850 per tonne of sugarcane to farmersRs 300 higher than the usual price.The state's sugar industry is going through a rough patch.

Apart from fresh waste or waste high moisture content, the KMC can only dump waste that is chemically inert. The KMC has developed a landfill site at a quarry. An activist said that the quarry is a source of water and the dumping of fresh waste may lead to pollution of underground water.Durgesh Lingras, a Rajarampuri-based activist, said, ""The KMC will dump the whole waste from the Kasba Bawda site. Officials have said that the waste contains 20% to 25% inert material. But, the KMC has not undertaken any study to decide on the quantum of inert material in the piled-up waste. We want the KMC to appoint scientists from the Shivaji University or KIT College to decide the inert material from the waste and its amount before shifting it to the landfill site.""At present, over 5 lakh tonne of waste has piled up at Kasba Bawda site over the last five years. The KMC does not have space to dump the waste and has undertaken the work to develop a landfill site at Takala and near Bawda's sugar mill. Civic officials have claimed that the work on the Takala landfill site is complete. But, activists have raised concerns regarding the absence of effective measures to tackle the menace of leachate, which is the dark fluid oozing out of the waste with harmful chemicals in it.""The cost of transporting the waste is high. The civic body does not have any weighing facility set up at the landfill site which is mandatory according to the rules of solid waste management. Also, there is a need to develop a facility to address incidents of fire. We want the KMC to appoint an environmental engineer to monitor the capping of the landfill site,"" Lingras said."

Long before Baba Ramdev set up his Patanjali chain of stores, Hyderabad's Dawasaz herbal pharmacies had left their own footprint in the world of natural medicine.As the city's herbal tradition continues with vigour, and a blend of traditional values and modern technology , almost every Dawasaz (Urdu for druggist) store has computerised data on herbs with barcodes for easy identification and dispensing.They have also come out with modern packing and newer formulations with exotic fruits to attract customers in developed countries.Apart from raw herbs, about 200 formulations are manufactured in Dawasaz stores dotting Old City. They have a combined turnover of about Rs 250 crore, and many products are exported to Europe, Africa, US, and West Asian countries.Hyderabad has about 300 hakeems catering to about 8,000 patients who visit various Unani clinics and hospitals in the city .Modern technology has, in a way, come as a major boon to the present generation manning Dawasaz stores.Many of them are not familiar with traditional herbs, that number in the thousands. Digitisation of the herbal database has made things easier for youngsters managing family businesses. Many practitioners of Unani, Ayurveda, Siddha, homoeopathy and naturopathy from different parts of south India depend on these stores.""It's not a badam-pista business,"" says Akash Vijay Vargi of Munnalal Dawasaz, which was set up in 1844, explaining how difficult it is to identify plant species, know their medicinal properties, and prepare herbal combinations to treat various ailments.""We import certain herbs from countries such as Nepal and Iran.Every soil has its own specialty, which adds to the medicinal properties of various herbs. We do not compromise on the ingredients. We even stop production if we do not get the right herb,"" says Akash.Dawasaz stores offer everything healthy, traditional, herbal and natural. The unique herbs and formulations vie with modern medicine in efficacy, affordability and cure. They, of course, come with the advantage of having ""no side effects"".They cater to a range of health problems. From fighting hairfall and improving skin tone to controlling blood sugar, enhancing bowel movements and curing liver ailments, Dawasaz has it all. They also sell formulations that promise to fight infertility and ageing.But a fast dwindling forest cover, coupled with the migration of labour from villages, has hit the industry .""Collecting herbs is a major challenge. There is severe shortage of manpower. Many herbs are becoming rare.The Union ministry of Ayush should provide proper guidance for product research and enhancement,"" says Rohit Gupta of Lala Dawasaz , which was set up in 1903.An increase in the cost of raw herbs has also affected the industry and dented profits. ""There has been a manifold increase in the cost of ingredients. But we do not compromise on quality. No doubt, profit margins have come down. We use herbs that are sourced from nature,"" says Maseeuddin Farooqui , managing partner, Karkhana Zinda Tilismath , established in 1920. The odds notwithstanding, Hyderabad's precursors to `Patanjali' stores continue to cater to the needs of lakhs of patients through safe and efficacious natural drugs."

So, the trollies carrying cane to the factories need to take the highway in the night. Also, it has been seen that most of the trollies are overloaded. Hence, the RTO decided to take strict action against the traffic rule violators.Regional Transport Officer DT Pawar said, ""The capacity of trollies depend upon its size. Most of the trollies carry sugarcane beyond their set capacity. They are not even equipped with reflectors. This could lead to an accident in the night. Many such incidents take place every year due to absence of reflectors. We cannot seize cane trollies but send notices regarding violations and they have to come up with the answers.""He added, ""In the road safety fortnight campaign, we have arranged lectures for cane trolley drivers in sugar factories. We will guide them on disadvantages of overloading. We will even put up reflectors on their trollies. The weight of the cane starts decreasing after cut from field. If we seize the tractor, it will affect the recovery of farmers. So, the awareness among tractor owners is an option for us. We have already started the awareness programme with all sugar factories in the district.""Abhidyana Chougule, a city resident, said, ""The trollies create traffic problems in the city. The load on trollies creates fear among bikers. It is difficult to deal with them and I have hardly seen any action against them by the traffic cops."""

Echoing him, Congress leader Komatireddy Venkata Reddy said ""The status and position of Governor has been lowered by Narasimhan with these remarks.

For those children who travel by school buses, there was further confusion. School managements were clueless, too, since the holiday notice came only one or two hours before school closed for the day.Bharathi Suresh, a parent whose child studies in a north Bengaluru school said, ""Our parents' WhatsApp group began to buzz around 1pm, so we started calling up the school to ask them about it. For about half an hour, the school was also confused as they hadn't received word. But later on, they sent us a text message that the school would close at 4pm, the regular time.""MA Khan, principal, KK English High School, Varthur, said, ""We got to know from some parents that the government had declared a holiday for schools today (Tuesday) but we hadn't received any information. We continued classes till 4pm as usual.""However, for all its 2,500-odd schools, the Private Unaided School Association in the state sent word to discontinue classes for the day at 1pm.

But classes were suspended at 1pm when we got the order.""Shivanna, a bus driver with a school on Hosur Road , said, ""Our school gives over at 3pm and we got to know about the holiday at 1pm, so the school decided to let the children remain on campus for two hours.""The sudden death of Karnataka sugar and cooperation minister H S Mahadeva Prasad was, indeed, very unfortunate. While we regret his sudden demise and understand the grief that it has caused Siddaramaiah , his close friend and long-time political associate, the decision by the chief minister to declare a state holiday is without precedent. It caused enormous hardship to people, especially parents, as children who were already in school had to be midway picked up and brought home. Banks, too, downed shutters, inconveniencing people who had lined up to withdraw money at the beginning of the month to meet their household expenditure. There are many ways to honour the dead. Declaring holidays is not the best one."

The hormones involved, such as cortisol, can lower the threshold for a cardiovascular event. The drop in temperatures cause the arteries to tighten, thus restricting blood flow and reducing oxygen supply to heart. All of this can trigger a heart attack.""Emphasizing on more awareness about cardiac health , he added, ""During my long period of medical practice, I've seen people suffer the most due to lack of awareness about their own health. If somebody is already at the risk of cardiovascular disease due to genetics, obesity or stress, then they need to be tender to their heart. Start slow and don't increase the intake of fatty foods, even though the cold weather might tempt you to indulge in sugary sweets.""For the people of northern region, it's especially important to ensure they keep themselves insulated and healthy to avoid increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, he added.

Aside from sugar, rubber and coconut plantations, there are areas and camps held by rebels that we cannot easily enter,"" jail warden Peter Bongngat told AFP.The southern Philippines is home to a decades-old Muslim separatist insurgency, as well as extremist gangs that have recently declared allegiance to the Islamic State.The southern region of Mindanao is the ancestral homeland of the Muslim minority in the largely Catholic Philippines.The badly overcrowded jail in Kidapawan, 950 kilometres (590 miles) south of Manila, contained rebels from the various groups as well as members of criminal gangs that thrive in the corruption and poverty of the south.The jail, which housed about 1,500 inmates, is a run-down former school building that militants have targeted repeatedly over the past 15 years.In 2007, Khair Mundos, a Filipino who would later become one of the world's most wanted accused terrorists escaped along with 48 other inmates. Mundos, with a $500,000 bounty from the US government, was recaptured in Manila seven years later.However Wednesday's jailbreak was the biggest in the nation's history, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology spokesman Xavier Solda told AFP.Solda said 13 ""high-value targets"" -- seven Muslim rebels and six organised crime gang members -- had not been able to escape on Wednesday.However Solda and Bongngat were not able to tell AFP who was still on the run, saying their identities were still being ""verified"".On Wednesday, Bongngat said the attackers were believed to be militants who had broken away from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the nation's largest Muslim rebel organisation which is in peace talks with the government.The MILF, which has about 10,000 armed followers, has been fighting since the 1970s for independence or autonomy.The rebellion has claimed more than 120,000 lives although the MILF has in recent years observed a ceasefire as part of the peace process.MILF spokesman Von al-Haq insisted Thursday that none of its members was involved in the raid, adding the group was willing to coordinate with government to allow searches in its communities.""The commander named to be the leader of the raid was 100 percent a notorious criminal. He was never a member of the MILF,"" Al-Haq told AFP.Al-Haq said the commander, known by an alias of Commander Derby, had broken into the jail to release a relative who was the leader of the Muslim inmates.Al-Haq said the relative and the leader of the Christian inmates were among the first to escape, and remained on the run."
58e4bce4a3d24b281b101d8a,Murder plot dressed as a wedding plan,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/murder-plot-dressed-as-a-wedding-plan/articleshow/56397329.cms,2017-01-08,"GREATER NOIDA: First came the fake wedding. Then choreographed caste tension. And finally an elopement . A 22-year-old woman did everything her lover told her to, believing it was the only way they could get married. But all he was doing was meticulously laying out an elaborate plot that had only one ending: her murder On December 26 last year, he strangled Madhuri at a sugarcane field in Greater Noida. Hemant Kaushik, a 30-year-old employee of a local health centre, was already married and had two children. In early 2016, he had started seeing Madhuri. Soon, she started insisting on marriage. Hemant had no such plan. But he kept up the ruse because he and Madhuri were from the same village  Mohammadpur Jadon in Rabupura  and he was afraid she would expose his indiscretion. At the same time, he knew he was playing a dangerous game and began planning the end.So, Kaushik went about planting one red herring after another in a way that no one ever suspected him as he led Madhuri down the path that would end in murder. It took the police 10 days of investigation to get to him. Kaushik was picked up from his home on Friday night. He broke down during interrogation and confessed, revealing a near-flawless plot built on lies, deception and the trust of a woman who blindly believed the man she loved.The murder was at least six months in the making. Kaushik told police that he started working on his plan when Madhuri started insisting on marriage. He apparently told her they would elope but Kaushik would have to deflect attention from himself for that. He asked her if she would be willing to go through a fake wedding for their cause, and she agreed, a police officer said. The plan was for Madhuri to ""patch up"" with her ex-boyfriend Rahul, who also lived in the area, and propose marriage to him. She did. Rahul agreed. On November 27, Madhuri accompanied Rahul and his three friends  Amit, Robin and Saurabh to an Arya Samaj temple and went through the wedding rituals. Kaushik then went to Madhuri's house and told her family she and Rahul had eloped.There was a subplot here that worked in Kaushik's favour. Madhuri was a Rajput and Rahul a Jat. Their 'wedding' led to a furore. A panchayat was called and the wedding annulled. But the village got to know. Kaushik's plan was working better than he had imagined.Police said on December 23, Kaushik told Madhuri the time was right to flee from the village and start a life together. She believed that and ran away with him. But they only went as far as a sugarcane field, 2km away. This, he said, would be where they would hide for a while till Kaushik found a suitable place to shift. In a little clearing in the field, Madhuri stayed put for three days, police said, braving the chill. Kaushik would bring her food, stay for some time and leave. But her patience was tested. On December 26, when she demanded to know what was going on, Kaushik strangled her with her dupatta, police said. He buried her body, returned to his house and went about his life.When Madhuri went missing, her father Munesh Kumar filed a case at Rabupura police station against Rahul and his three friends, accusing them of kidnapping her, exactly as Kaushik had imagined. Police picked up the four and put them through sustained interrogation but they could reveal nothing. Cops then cast the net wider and put mobile phones under surveillance. They focused on calls made in the region on and after December 23.Police said during investigation, they found there was constant communication between two mobile phone numbers from December 23-26. But December 26 onwards, both phones had been switched off. The location of one number was frequently near Kaushik's home. That got the cops interested. During interrogation, Kaushik told the cops he had bought two SIM cards on fake identity cards and given one to Madhuri. Both phones were found with him. Madhuri's decomposed body was dug out and sent for an autopsy. Kaushik has been charged with murder and kidnapping.Sujata Singh, SP (rural), said Kaushik worked as a computer operator at an educational institute in Greater Noida. He married three years ago and has two children."

External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj had made fervent appeal to locate the family of Geeta. ""There is a hospital at the end of the lane of her house. There are paddy and sugarcane fields. On the other side is a railway track and Durga Mandir . There is a rivulet close by where people do fishing. From what she has conveyed, she appears to be from Bihar or Jharkhand,"" Swaraj had claimed."

""Each farmer takes a bank loan to cultivate sugarcane and can hardly produce about 40 metric tonnes of cane per year,"" Prabhudesai said.""""Though the government claims paying a support price to the farmers, it actually pays only the rate. The same rate is also paid to Karnataka farmers,"" Prabhudesai claimed.Desai declared that they would begin the hunger strike at Azad Maidan, Panaji, from Thursday."

Paul was today produced at the special court of the CBI after end of his six days of remand. He was sent to Jharapada jail after the court gave its verdict. Jail sources said that Paul broke down upon reaching the prison. Jail officials tried to calm him down and the actor returned to his normal self after about half an hour. Shortly after he was taken to the jail hospital after he complained of breathing problem, high blood sugar and blood pressure. Jail officials said he would be kept under the watch of doctors at the hospital till tomorrow morning. During the hearing in the court, the prosecution counsel opposed his bail arguing that being an influential person Paul could influence the investigation process and tamper with evidence. On the other hand, Paul's lawyer cited his poor health while praying for his bail. ""Paul was an officer-bearer of the Rose Valley for around five and half months in 2010 before resigning from the post. The company had accepted his resignation. If according to the CBI's claim the company used his political clout to run the show, then how could it accept his resignation,"" actor's counsel Sabyasachi Banerjee said. The defence counsel also maintained that Paul had never delivered any public speech either to attract any investment for the company or to attract any investor. ""The blood pressure of Paul fluctuated last night and the CBI is well aware of that. My client is ready to surrender his passport and stay in Odisha to co-operate with the CBI,"" said Banerjee.

One year passed and he was finally arrested in December last year. The CBI has neither mentioned his name in the preliminary chargesheet, nor in the FIR at that point of time. But it has arrested him now, though he cooperated fully with the CBI,"" Banerjee said. During his remand, Paul was twice taken to the Capital Hospital after he complained of illness. During one of his appearance at the hospital, he had alleged that Union minister Babul Supriyo had close relationship with Rose Valley chairman Gautam Kundu and had implicated him in the case. ""He (Babul) is like a member of their family and they have done films together. Many political leaders, including Babul Supriyo, are involved in the money-laundering scam,"" Paul had said at the Capital Hospital.

It is also expected to pose some political challenge for the ruling party to retain its electoral ground in the region, considered a stronghold of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.Nanjangud bypollThe death of Mahadeva Prasad, who represented Gundlupet constituency in Chamarajanagar district, has come on the heels of veteran Dalit leader V. Srinivas Prasad parting ways with the Congress and joining the BJP. With the byelection for the Nanjangud Assembly constituency scheduled to be announced soon, the Congress, which is yet to identify a candidate to take on Mr. Srinivas Prasad, will sorely miss the presence of Mahadeva Prasad during campaigning in the constituency with a large number of Lingayat voters. Mahadeva Prasad, who was part of Mr. Siddaramaiahs coterie since their Janata Dal days, had managed to bring key cooperative institutions such as Karnataka Milk Federation and Karnataka State Cooperative Marketing Federation under the control of the Congress during his tenure. President of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association Kurubur Shanthakumar said Mahadeva Prasad had managed to escape the ire of sugarcane growers by his adept handling of difficult situations.The Congress, which had swept Chamarajanagar district by winning all the four Assembly seats in 2013, had emerged as a dominant political force in the region. The party had won 12 of the 15 Assembly seats in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts.As political observers in the region are debating over the prospects of the Congress in the region without both Mahadeva Prasad and Mr. Srinivas Prasad, veteran leader A.H. Vishwanath regretted that the Congress and the party government were not moving together.Neither the Chief Minister nor the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president G. Parameshwar are bothered about the party activities. The party should stir itself into action before the Nanjangud byelection and be prepared for the Assembly elections, he said."

Farmers in and around Tiruvalarcholai near here are getting ready to harvest the crop.Though the monsoon failure had posed difficulties, many farmers who had grown the variety had managed to irrigate their fields using diesel pump-sets. As we had taken advance from the wholesale dealers, we have to ensure that the sugarcane was fully grown in time for the festival, said a cross-section of farmers. They say that the cultivation cost had gone up this season due to failure of monsoon and the price is likely to go up as compared to last year. A sugarcane grower of Tiruvalarcholai, Subramani, said the cane with larger number of nodes is expected to attract a field price of Rs. 18, the smaller ones would be sold for Rs. 15.The field price of the cane is expected to go up by at least Rs. 3 apiece and there will be a corresponding increase in retail markets.Farmers said they would harvest the crop by January 12 and the produce would be moved to markets immediately by wholesale dealers. The famers had raised the cane in Panguni (March - April) so that the cane could be harvested before Pongal festival. According to sources, there has been a sharp decline in the area under cultivation of the edible variety of sugarcane.Tiruvalarcholai, Uttamarseeli and Panayapuram besides parts of Thuraiyur are the major areas where the edible cane is cultivated. A large number of sugarcane farmers of Posampatti, Koppu and Ettarai had given up sugarcane cultivation as it has to be tended for about 10 months."

Presently I am taking a legal opinion in this matter. I am mentally prepared to file a criminal and civil case against him. He himself has given me this opportunity. Earlier, he had alleged that the scam was worth Rs. 15,000 crore and now he says it is worth Rs. 25,000 crore. I do not know how, as I am not so good at mathematics, Mr. Pawar said at a press conference in Thane, held at the residence of NCP MLA Dr. Jitendra Awhad. Mr. Pawars stand comes ahead of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) polls.Mr. Hazare has approached the Bombay High Court claiming the scam has pulled Maharashtra back by 50 years and has put the State under financial debt to the tune of hundreds of crores. The criminal petition is likely to be heard on January 6.Condemning the recent incident in Pune in which the statue of legendary Marathi author Ram Ganesh Gadkari alias Govindagraj was damaged, Mr Pawar said no one would support such an act. Gadkari has made tremendous contribution to Marathi literature. I have never come across any objectionable writing by him on Chhatrapati Sambhaji and neither do I know of it. However, whoever wants to oppose someones thinking should do it by rational arguments and not by vandalism, Mr. Pawar said.Taunting BJP ally Shiv Sena for its continuous stand of opposing the governments policies, Mr. Pawar said both parties are together for the sake of power. The Opposition will take a united stand on whether to ask the President to stop the Central government from presenting the Union Budget. Meanwhile, Uddhav Thackeray has presented our position and we welcome his stand, he said. In a speech on Wednesday, the Sena chief had asked the President to consider the announcement of Assembly polls in five states and prevent the Union Budget from being presented."

Bio-fencing of farms with thorny plants that scare, irritate or injure was another option. They were all used in the past.Today, even elephant proof trenches and solar fencing which came with the scientific wave could not stop the raiders. Trenches got filled up without maintenance and solar fences became faulty. Some farmers used direct power supply to the solar fence, killing elephants and sometimes humans.Elephants then outsmarted the fences, beating them down with wooden logs, a retired forest official who served in conflict zones pointed out.Enter, firecrackersWith fragmented elephant migratory corridors and depleted water and fodder raising conflict levels, especially in places where forest buffer zones were absent, local communities began to innovate. Farmers and villagers alike stocked up on powerful search lights and firecrackers, which are also by the Forest Department.A changed cropping pattern avoiding jack fruit, banana, sugarcane and maize also helped reduce the conflict.In addition, there are area-specific innovative practices: people in Kodaikanal tie up colourful old clothes to scare away wild boar and gaur, says K. Kalidasan, President of Osai  an NGO working for wildlife conservation. Such methods exist in addition to sensor-based early warning systems on elephant movement.Some have tried putting pebbles into plastic bottles and tying them along the farm land boundary, to produce sounds when the wind blows, scaring elephants away. There are places where villagers keep the FM radio on throughout the night, deceiving wild animals into thinking that people are present. Man-made bee hives are put up on trees along the forest boundaries to irritate and deter elephants in the Western Ghats. .Forest officials say they have trained farmers to spray chilly powder on clothes after dipping them in used cooking oil. The oil helps the chilly powder stick to clothes that can then be placed on farm boundaries. At Sirumugai in Coimbatore, farmers use flashing LED lights to scare wild animals.In a variation of the stink bomb, old clothes soaked in a herbal solution to produce a stench was tried out in Madukkarai and Kovaipudur areas. The NGO which propagated the technique keeps the ingredients a secret, say forest officials. Instead of conventional vertical solar fences, Forest officials are trying out a hanging type of solar fence at Thekkampatti."

Photo: R. RavindranThe neighbourhood tea shops appear to be learning a lesson or two from the success of upscale coffee chains in the city. In the last six months, as many as three start-ups selling premium varieties of tea have begun dotting Chennais landscape.The startups  Chai King, Tea2go and Chai Kings  are offering high quality tea at affordable prices. Sensing huge opportunity, the trio are also on an expansion mode. Ball park estimates indicate that in Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), the IT corridor of Chennai, on an average 4 lakh cups of tea is sold per day, of which 60 per cent sales happen in the evening and midnight.Currently, the market is unorganised and there is tremendous potential, said Suresh Radhakrishnan, founder of Chai King which commenced operations in August 2016. We prepare freshly brewed authentic tea sourced from Nilgiris and door deliver to corporates. We operate on a QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) model and we are the first mover in this space in Chennai. We also take advice from tea tasters and experts, he said. Chai King sells 700-900 cups per day from its outlet in Virugambakkam. The venture started off with a self funded capital of Rs. 8 lakh and its second outlet will be operational soon.After studying the Chennai market for more than eight months, Jahabar Sadique, co-founder of Chai Kings forayed into this space in October 2016. He said, When we did a preliminary analysis we found that if an outlet sold 1,200 cups of hot beverages 1,000 cups are only tea. We wanted the city to have hygienic tea at the same time at affordable price, Sadique said. According to him, Chai Kings uses sulphur free sugar, no emission electric bikes for delivery and six-stage filtered water used for chai preparation. The start-up which was started with initial investment of Rs. 85 lakh sells 800-1,000 cups of tea per day and is also looking to scale up to four more outlets from its existing three.The latest entrant in this space is Tea2go, a mobile tea vendor business started in January. Not many like to have tea from a vendor selling tea on cycles as they are skeptical about hygiene. We prepare tea at a centralised location and give it to vendors who work for us. Our cycle is designed in a way where even the cups have separate cabins to rest and are not exposed to dust. Our vendors wear a hair cap while at work, said its founder Sivaraj Muthuraman. Tea2go has 10 cycles each selling 250-300 cups of tea per day at various locations.Night shift marketNow the focus is on the night shift market, which is huge. The OMR belt will be our focus, said Sivaraj who has pumped in Rs. 3 lakh into this venture.According to analysts who track the hot beverages market in Chennai, the Ambattur belt sells more than 4 lakh cups of tea per day, T. Nagar sells more than 5 lakh cups of tea per day. Employees working in the IT sector and construction workers are the major consumers. One of the employees at a tea shop neighbouring the Olympia Techno Park, Guindy, said, We sell around 4,000 cups of tea per day.Estimates indicate that in OMR alone,an average of four lakh cups of teais sold per day"

Rama Rao, who was replying to a question in the Assembly on Saturday.He saw some merit in the conspiracy observation made by the Congress MLA T. Jeevan Reddy and said the company was running in profits and bagged several awards for energy conservation and protection of environment when it was under the control of Birla family. It was transferred to Poddars and their mismanagement of finances has led to the present situation.He said several meetings were held for its revival but the owners only tried to use them to pressurise the government to extract more benefits.However, they did not come up with an action plan of 10 years.Instead, they used the power subsidy given by the government to clear some old debts, he said.Mr. Rao, who was responding to questions from T.

Depression can have a serious impact on a persons well-being and their ability-cum-motivation to self-manage their condition. People with diabetes suffering from depression are at greater risk of suffering from diabetic burnout which collectively can have adverse effect on physical health and may lead to more long-term complications, according to Dr. Sunil Kumar Kota, diabetes super specialist and consultant endocrinolgist.Dr. Sunil Kumar, who was in the city on a days visit, told The Hindu that damage resulting from diabetic neuropathy or blocked blood vessels in the brain may contribute to depression in people with diabetes. People who have both conditions are 82 % more likely to experience a heart attack, he said.It seems both diabetes and depression are caused by the same risk factors. They include family history, obesity, hypertension, inactivity, coronary artery disease.He said poor diabetes management can also prompt symptoms similar to those of depression. For instance, people with too high or too low blood sugar may experience increased feelings of anxiety, restlessness, or low energy. Low blood sugar levels can also cause feelings of shakiness and sweating, which are symptoms similar to anxiety.He said research has found that people who suffer from both diabetes and depression have poorer metabolic and glycemic control. Certain lifestyle changes may also help relieve symptoms and promote overall wellness, he said.PsychotherapyAlso known as talk therapy, psychotherapy can be effective for reducing symptoms of depression. The goal of psychotherapy is to recognise potential triggers, identify and replace unhealthy behaviours, develop a positive relationship to promote healthy problem-solving skills, Dr Sunil Kumar said Regular exercise can help relieve symptoms by boosting the feel good chemicals in brain, he said. Additionally, this activity triggers the growth of new brain cells in the same manner as antidepressant medications, he added."

On Monday, a group of farmers affiliated to Tamizhaga Vivasaigal Sangam reiterated this demand to the district administration and brought in their withered crops as proof.With Vellore facing a crisis situation, the farmers said that some of the worst-hit areas in the district are Pernambut, Gudiyatham, Katpadi and Natrampalli taluks, and the major crops affected were sugarcane, pulses, paddy and groundnut.The association submitted a petition to Collector S.A. Raman during the public grievance redressal day on Monday.R. Subash, president of the associations Vellore east youth wing, said the district was facing severe drought condition. Never has such a worse situation prevailed in the district. The State government should declare the district as drought-prone, and provide relief of Rs. 25,000 for an acre to farmers, he said.The associations district general secretary S. Udayakumar said there has been poor rainfall in Vellore for the last 16 years. He pointed out to the Prime Ministers announcement of relief for farmers if 33 per cent of their crop has been damaged. There is no water in our wells. The water in borewells will last only for a few months. The government should extend relief for farmers. All loans obtained by farmers from nationalised and private banks should be waived off, he said."

Starting with Mauritius, new procedures and documents will be put in place so that PIOs from these countries get their cards, Mr. Modi said.Other issues of PIOs in Reunion Island, Fiji, Guyana and Suriname would also be addressed, he added.He said the date for converting PIO cards to OCI cards without paying penalty had been extended to June 30.A good stepWelcoming the announcement, Jean Regis Ramsamy Nadarassin, who is part of a delegation from Reunion Island, said it was a indeed a good step. The Reunion Island is about 200 km southwest of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. The Indian government should understand the situation and should come out with specific policy to address the issue, he said, pointing out at the problem of PIOs in Reunion Island, where it has become next to impossible to get the OIC card due to lack of proper documentation.Many on our island are seventh generation PIOs for whom it is difficult to get details beyond four generations. The only way is through an Act of Parliament that would provide OCI card, he added."

More than a century later, the People of Indian Origin in this French island are fluent in French and Creole, but not in their native tongue, Tamil. However, now theres a kind of revival where they are attempting to relearn Tamil in schools and temples in the region.Though we have retained traditional food habits, cultural and religious practices, we have lost our language and links with the families in India, said Jean Regis Ramsamy Nadarassin, a historian and journalist, who was part of the 14-member delegation at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas.

Like in many other Gurmitya countries, PIOs in Reunion Island have been facing problems in obtaining Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards due to unavailability of documents. Our estimate is about 30 people out of about three lakh PIO population has the OCI card.

Every one cannot afford to do this, he said.With a gloomy face, he said, Nobody knows us in Bharat; we are a forgotten diaspora.When MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup was asked how the Ministry could help PIOs relearn their mother tongue, he said the government has been helping communities across the world in their efforts. It is also helping setting up Chairs in universities. Sending a person from India may not be a viable option. But, there are other ways, including online classes where one can learn a language."
58f4d30b60de470aa339c49d,SHOCK REALITY,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170126/jsp/bihar/story_132335.jsp,2017-01-26,"The Telegraph team visited Patna's Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital, Rajendra Nagar Hospital and New Gardiner Road Hospital on Tuesday to find out the state of affairs in the three super-speciality health facilities. The findings are an eye-opener for the residents and the state government which claims to provide quality healthcare services to the people. The outpatient department (OPD) is supposed to function from 9am to 2pm daily with four or five doctors dedicated to the facility in each of these hospitals. But be prepared to wait in long queues for the doctor as he/she might come around one to two hours late. If that does not drain you out, here is more. You might be asked to purchase the medicines from private stores. Why? Because the hospitals' drug shops don't have adequate stocks. If you think about getting your diagnostic tests done at the same facility thinking that you won't have to pay anything because of the free service, brace for a bigger shock. Hospital staff may hand you over a slip of some private diagnostic facility from where you have to get the tests done, at a cost. Doing so is illegal by the hospital staff. Here are some of the key findings: Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan HospitalSuper-speciality tag for: Orthopaedic disorders Doctor availability in the outpatient department: A neuro-surgeon and an orthopaedic surgeon were not found in the chamber. While the former did not turn up till 9.50am, the ortho surgeon had not come till 10.30am on Tuesday. Hospital director H.N. Diwakar conceded that doctors engaged in OPD duty are often late but promised action. Medicine availability: Drugs for osteoarthritis and muscle spasm were found missing in the hospital store. Hospital director H.N. Diwakar admits that only six to seven types of drugs are available at the hospital, including painkillers. According to him, the Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructure Corporation Limited (BMSICL) had provided the drugs last year. The hospital is somehow managing drug requirement for emergency patients as the director has been entitled to purchase medicines worth around Rs 5 lakh. The Telegraph also found doctors prescribing medicines with brand names such as Movace SP (a painkiller) though the drugs with the generic name aceclofenac was found at the hospital. Neelam Devi of Sitamarhi, a patient admitted in the hospital's indoor wing, said they had to buy the crepe bandage from outside. Diagnostic facilities: If you come with broken legs, doctors would advise you to get MRI and CT scan tests done from outside. MRI and CT scan machines are not available at this super-speciality hospital for orthopaedic disorders. You would have to pay for X-ray facility as the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), which was providing the facility for free here, has stopped it because of funds-related issues. So patients are dependent on the X-ray facility being run in PPP mode at the hospital for which they have to pay. Other lapses: The Telegraph team found one patient, Navin Kumar from Raja Bazar locality, who was handed over a slip of a private diagnostic facility to get his tests done from outside. Two medical representatives were also spotted in the hospital during outpatient department hours. As per the government's direction, medical representatives are not allowed to visit doctors during OPD hours. Many patients were found running from pillar to post to get their disability certificate made at the hospital as the official supposed to provide them the document was found absent till 10.30am. Ambulance facility: The hospital has no ambulance though it has a driver who takes home a salary and works for health department officials. New Gardiner Road HospitalSuper-speciality tag for: Endocrinology disorders Doctor availability: One of the doctors was found absent in the outpatient department chamber till 10.56am on Tuesday. Patients said doctors coming in late is a regular occurrence. Hospital medical superintendent Manoj Kumar said he was ""surprised"" that doctors were missing from their chambers during OPD hour. Medicine availability: It's a super-speciality hospital for endocrinology-related disorders, right? Sadly the hospital does not have sugar-related medicines or even insulin injections. Basic iron and related tablets are unavailable. Diagnostic facility: Ultrasound tests are not being conducted for the past one month. Patients are also advised to get thyroid tests done from outside. The hospital does not have CT scan and MRI facilities. Medical superintendent Manoj Kumar said the new radiologist was supposed to join work six days ago but had not yet done so. Other lapses: Not found Ambulance: No facilityRajendra Nagar HospitalSuper-speciality tag for: Eye-related disorders Doctor availability: Of the three hospitals The Telegraph team visited, only in this were doctors not found absent in their chambers during OPD hours. Medicine availability: Not a single eye-related medicine is available for patients in the outpatient department, confirmed hospital superintendent Naresh Kumar Bhimsariya. Diagnostic facility: The super-speciality hospital for eye-related disorders does not have cornea, complete blood count, HIV and hepatitis test facilities. Other lapses: The hospital has still not started an eye bank, forget about corneal transplant facility. The idea of starting an eye bank at Rajendra Nagar Hospital was conceived in 2013 but the facilities remain a non-starter. The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) started an eye bank and corneal transplant facility in 2014. Ambulance: Like the two other super-speciality hospitals, this too does not have an ambulance facility."
58f4d31060de470aa339c4a5,jab at PM,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170128/jsp/nation/story_132757.jsp,2017-01-28,"(From left) Pawar, Uddhav and ModiNagpur, Jan. 27: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has been wondering whether conferring the Padma Vibhushan on Sharad Pawar was a "" gurudakshina"" of sorts to him from the Prime Minister. ""I don't know if awards can also be offered as dakshina,"" Uddhav said caustically at a rally on Thursday while launching the Sena campaign for the BMC elections scheduled in mid-February. Uddhav is being seen as taking a jibe at Narendra Modi, who had referred to Pawar as his ""political guru"" at a November 2016 event organised by an autonomous sugarcane growers' body in Pune. Modi had recounted at the Vasantdada Sugar Institute how the NCP chief helped him in the early phase of his political career. Pawar, who heads the institute, had in turn praised Modi's demonetisation decision. Pawar had then termed demonetisation a radical move to weed out black money. He has since gone back on his words, saying the decision had hit farmers hard. Uddhav brought up the issue while announcing the break-up of the 25-year-old Sena-BJP alliance for the BMC elections. As he dug his claws into the BJP, he also took a swipe at the Modi-Pawar bonhomie, wondering if an award could be offered as "" dakshina"" to a ""guru"". Pawar has yet to react to Uddhav's jibe. But he said the Sena could consider taking a decision on exiting the Devendra Fadnavis government, if it was so opposed to aligning with the BJP for the local body elections. Both the Sena and the BJP have, however, made it clear that the decision not to contest the local body elections together would not impact the BJP-Sena government in Maharashtra. Modi and Pawar have shared the dais on a few occasions in Maharashtra, despite the Prime Minister having dubbed the NCP a ""naturally corrupt party"" in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. Last December, the two leaders had shared the stage in Pune during the foundation-stone ceremony for the Pune Metro. The NCP has been having a tacit alliance with the BJP in many local bodies, a fact not hidden from either the Sena or the Congress. The Padma award for Pawar has given the parties a chance to take potshots at the BJP ahead of the February 21 elections. Today, Sena cadres burst crackers and distributed sweets at the decision to go into the polls alone, saying they were finally free of BJP subjugation. But the BJP was more guarded in its reaction, calling Uddhav's decision unfortunate. ""You could have broken the alliance but been a little more decent about your words,"" Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari said in New Delhi today. Uddhav's style of politics and speech stands in contrast with that of his father, the late Bal Thackeray. He was apparently vitriolic in his attack on the BJP yesterday, much in line with that party's aggression in Mumbai."
58f4d32060de470aa339c4bf,Homecoming call bites BJP in riot-hit zone,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170210/jsp/nation/story_135041.jsp,2017-02-10,"Ramesh (centre), a resident of Qutba village Muzaffarnagar/Shamli Feb. 9: Ghar wapsi (homecoming) may be music to the BJP's ears but in the sugarcane-rich Jat heartland of western Uttar Pradesh, it is giving the party sleepless nights. Veer Singh, a Jat in Qutba village, said: ""The Assembly election is like homecoming for us. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, we had been taken in by the BJP's promises, which have remained unfulfilled. On Saturday, we are going to vote for the Rashtriya Lok Dal."" Taking a long drag from his hookah, the octogenarian paused and added with a smile: "" Subah ka bhoola agar shaam ko ghar laut aaye to usse bhoola nahin kehte (If one realises his mistake and makes amends, he should be forgiven)."" Qutba, the epicentre of the September 2013 communal violence in Muzaffarnagar district in which over 50 people were killed and 60,000 displaced, is the native village of Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, a riot accused who went on to become a minister in the Narendra Modi government. Singh said Modi had failed to deliver on his promises and farmers were suffering because of that. A note of repentance crept into his voice while he recounted the violence that soured the relations between Jats and Muslims, who had always coexisted peacefully. "" Ab yahan na riot hai aur na hi Modi ki lehar (Here is no riot now, nor a Modi wave),"" he said. ""But his speeches are very good,"" Singh added. The anger among Jats is palpable in several parts of the sugar bowl of India. The community is disappointed at Modi's ""broken promises"" - Jats are yet to get reservations, sugarcane prices haven't increased, farm loans have not been waived and mills still make irregular payments. The demonetisation drive has made matters worse for the dominant farming community. ""Other than delivering excellent pro-farmer speeches, Modiji has not done anything to fulfil his promises,"" said Ram Singh, a resident of the adjoining district of Shamli. He accused the BJP of engineering the riots for political gains. ""There is no politics of riot in this election and we have become wiser,"" he said. Veer Singh (right), a resident of Qutba village Traditionally, the Jats and the Muslims have voted for Ajit Singh's RLD and before him, for his father and former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh. But the 2013 violence changed the voting pattern as the Jats rallied behind Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Many Dalits, who have supported BSP chief Mayawati over the years, also sided with the BJP. But the caste arithmetic is back this election - the Dalits, Harijans and the Gujjars seem to have returned to Mayawati's fold. The Baniyas, the trading community, have said they will maintain a distance from the BJP because of the demonetisation. The BJP is banking on upper caste votes and a possible division of Muslim-Dalit votes. In some pockets of western Uttar Pradesh, the Jats are, however, divided and said they would vote for the BJP as they suspected Ajit Singh could join hands with the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance after the polls. ""Akhilesh Yadav is only concerned about Muslims. Some Jats lost their lives in the violence but he did not pay any compensation to their families. Modi thinks about everyone,"" said Chaudhury Bange Ram, a resident of Sisauli which was untouched by the riot. Rampal Singh, another Sisauli resident, said Modi was working for the development of all. ""He thinks about the country as a whole. What will happen if Ajit Singh joins hands with Akhilesh?"" he asked. The riot-displaced Muslims who are living in five camps said they would vote for chief minister Akhilesh. ""He is our saviour. It's only because of his compensation of Rs 5 lakh to each affected family that we rebuilt our lives,"" said Rukshana, the mother of three daughters. Seated on a charpoy inside her cramped settlement in Shahpur near Muzaffarnagar town, Rukshana said: ""We will be safe only when secular parties are voted to power."" In Shahpur town, the Samajwadi office was abuzz with activity on Wednesday. Only a few supporters were seen in the BSP office across the road. Muslims constitute 25-30 per cent of the voters in the 73 western Uttar Pradesh constituencies that will vote on Saturday. Dalits make up 19 per cent of the voters. Mayawati will stand to gain if they vote en block but that seems unlikely. Dalits in the area said they had suffered the most under Modi. ""We made a big mistake by voting for Modi in the Lok Sabha polls. We want to set things right this time. The Modi government only works for the rich and the upper castes. We don't figure in his scheme of things,"" said Ramesh, a Jatav. His son Aman, a graduate, works for a multinational company in Gurgaon. ""He applied for a job in the railways but they asked him to pay a bribe, which we could not. Only Mayawati works for the empowerment of the oppressed,"" Ramesh said. Many Dalits who worked in brick kilns and farmlands lost their jobs because of the demonetisation and said they would vote for the BSP. Chandrakant Sharma, a riot accused and Qutba resident, said upper caste Brahmins ""have always voted for the BJP and this time will be no different"". A group of Muslims sitting in a tea stall said Mayawati was a ""good administrator"" and recounted that no riots had taken place during her rule."

Many farmers have cultivated Coc-92061 variety as it can withstand diseases and suitable for drought-prone areas.On the quality of sugarcane, the source said that the sugar recovery would be far less this season as the cane had not registered adequate growth. It will be around seven per cent or less. The problem would be more serious during the forthcoming season (2017-18), as cane-growers were hesitant not to burn their fingers again.Farmers of Malvai village in the border of Tiruchi and Ariyalur districts said they had to make special efforts for irrigating their fields. The length of the nodes would be larger had the north-east monsoon set in time. But the total failure of monsoon had forced them to draw water using motors. Even the serious depletion of groundwater had disappointed them."

58f4d51260de470aa339c80e,BMW 3 reward for five-star cabbie with drive,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170203/jsp/calcutta/story_133763.jsp,2017-02-03,"Feb. 2: His father sold coal and he sugarcane juice. Life was hard. And then he learnt to drive. The wheels turned. At 42, Ramesh Shaw, school dropout and brother to eight sisters, can look back at a career well-steered. He has just won a BMW 3 Series as app-cab aggregator Ola's Star Driver Partner of the year. For Ramesh, the long, arduous journey had started when his migrant father, wracked by asthma, could no longer carry coal blocks to sell. ""He had eight daughters and a son, which is me. People would keep trying for a son in those days, you know. He married off five of my sisters but then became seriously unwell and that was when life got very difficult for us,"" he recalled. Ramesh, whose roots are in Bihar's Chapra region, came to Calcutta in 1989 as a five-year-old. He studied till Class VIII at New National High School, Kankurgachhi, before circumstances ended his formal education. ""I dropped out of school because my father was very ill. I could no longer watch him suffer,"" he said. The next eight years saw Ramesh toiling in a hosiery factory. He earned little but scrimped and saved some cash to buy a sugarcane crusher and strike out on his own. After selling juice on a Phoolbagan pavement for four years, Ramesh decided to take driving lessons and bought a Tata Indica with ""some money that I had saved and some that I borrowed"". His car rental business was going along nicely until his regular client for three years, a bank manager, was transferred. This got him thinking whether to try something new. ""By then, there were these Ola cars on the roads; so I walked into the Ola office in May 2015 and became a partner driver. I bought a Swift Dzire after selling off my Indica and also obtained a luxury taxi permit,"" he recounted. There has been no looking back since. Ramesh is online on the Ola platform at 8 in the morning almost without fail and his day doesn't end until 10 to 10.30 at night. ""I have done a maximum of 23 trips in a day,"" smiled the 42-year-old, who was gifted a bed worth Rs 25,000 for finishing third in Bengal in the Ola Star Driver Partner contest last year. This year, Ramesh topped the all-India contest and the gleaming white BMW 3 Series in his garage is something that constantly reminds him of where he had reached. So, what is it that sets him apart from the rest? ""I never refuse a trip, even if it is at the end of a tiring day. Only the other day, just as I was finishing my 14th trip and nearing my garage, there was this passenger looking for a cab to go to Konnagar. I didn't refuse,"" he said. Not refusing trips isn't the only thing that makes Ramesh the best on the Ola platform. His passengers consistently rate him five stars for his easy manners and helpful nature. He puts their luggage in the boot and takes them out - all with a smile. Ramesh is proud that his two daughters go to a convent school. He intends taking out his BMW automatic for a spin when he has the time. What message do you have for Ramesh Shaw? Tell [email protected]"

Last year, there was 853 mm rainfall in the district.This time, the accrual was just 175 mm from the southwest monsoon and 68 mm from the northeast monsoon. A majority of farmers are in a state of shock and disbelief since the district, so far, used to receive abundant rainfall during the northeast monsoons.There is little scope for rainfall benefiting agriculture until the next monsoons. But, there was a high possibility for scores of farmers ending their lives due to mounting debts and absence of income source for survival. The fodder availability has also dried up arresting their dependence on milch cows for supplementary income, says Logusamy, district unit organising secretary of Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam.He urged the State Government to emulate Karnataka and Kerala in acting promptly and securing financial package from the Centre. The district administration has started enumerating the loss caused by the dry conditions in fields reconciled for cultivation of paddy, turmeric, sugarcane, banana, tapioca, groundnut, cotton and all other agricultural and horticultural crops.The calculation will be made easier by perusing the crop damage data generated already by Tamil Nadu Agricultural University and satellite imageries in possession of Indian Council of Agricultural Research, farmers say.There is also a growing voice among small-scale cultivators that primary agricultural cooperative banks must be obliterated from political influences. By and large, politically influential people gain priority in securing fresh loans, they complain.Representatives of farmers organisations say that while waiving of existing loans and forwarding of fresh loans are necessary to save lives of several cultivators, fixing of reasonable amount as compensation for the damaged crops was vital for sustaining livelihood.The compensation per acre of completely dried crop must be fixed at around Rs. 30,000, and for each dried coconut tree, Rs. 10,000 must be provided, said K.V. Ponnaiyan, president of Tamil Nadu Swadeshi Farmers Association."

It was difficult to meet the needs of the remaining population with four lakh tonnes, especially in a State reliant on the public distribution system. Hence, there was an urgent need to raise the foodgrain quota.Raise sugar quotaThe government also wanted the Centre to raise the sugar quota. The 3,600 tonnes of sugar being provided at present was insufficient to meet the demand. It should be enhanced to 8,600 tonnes, the meeting felt.As directed by the Centre, the State government had identified 200 acres at Kinaloor in Kozhikode for setting up an all India institute of medical sciences. The MPs were requested to persuade the Centre to set up the institute.The government also wanted them to raise the need for setting up a tertiary cancer care centre at the Malabar Cancer Centre.Once the State GST and Inter-State GST Bills come up for discussion in Parliament, the MPs should press for the States demand that tax collection from traders with an annual turnover below Rs. 1.5 crore should be vested with the State government and also adequate powers on cross empowerment too should be delegated to it.Insurance schemeThe government wanted the Centre to provide 60 per cent funds for the insurance scheme envisaged for migrant labour. The meeting also discussed the need for launching the proposed industrial corridor linking Kochi and Palakkad. This needed to be expedited in the wake of the formation of the National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust, the meeting felt."

Anticipating brisk sales, vendors have brought additional loads of sugarcane and turmeric from various districts to markets in the city.One of the most important features of Pongal, sugarcane is being sold in bunches, each with 10 pieces, in the wholesale Goubert Market on Bharathi Street.

Over 30 loads of sugarcane procured from Chidambaram, Sirkazhi and various parts of neighbouring Tamil Nadu have arrived at the wholesale markets.However, the sale of colourful clay pots has been dull this year as a majority of the people prefer to cook in gas stoves.

This has hit sugar factories and the backyard jaggery-making units. Bidar has five sugar factories  three in the cooperative sector and two private units. Sugarcane is also bought by around 10 Khand Saris or mini factories that make diamond sugar and molasses.Each of the big cooperative units eat up five lakh tonnes to make five lakh quintals of sugar every year. But according to officials, this year they have crushed only to around half their capacity before closing the crushing season. All three together may have crushed only 6-8 lakh tonnes. The private units and the Khand Saris together have crushed 2-3 lakh tonnes, a senior official of the Cooperation Department said.When farm produce is in short supply, farmers usually get good prices. But not now, said Vishwanath Patil Koutha, a Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader. Despite the scarcity, we are not getting a fair price. Factories are not offering anything above Rs. 1,800 a quintal, which was the price last year, he said.Domino effectAccording to traders, jaggery prices are likely to increase. In the retail market, one bucket of black jaggery is selling for Rs. 45 a kg, while white buckets are selling for Rs. 65 a kg. This may go be in the Rs. 60-90 range in a couple of months, said Basavaraj Chatre, a trader.Molasses is a highly regulated product as it is used to make alcohol. Despite the controls, its price keeps varying, depending on availability. Whenever less sugarcane is crushed, molasses becomes scarce and costly. This in turn pushes up the price of jaggery, he said.Lack of skilled labour to make jaggery is another hindrance, say jaggery-making farmers. This is the first time in nine years that we have not taken up jaggery making in our field, said Mallikarjun Chowli, a farmer from Kolar village. Labour wages are high and farmers are not selling us sugarcane. Whatever jaggery I need this year for my family, I will buy from the shop."

Photos: M. SrinathM_SRINATHWith the drought having a severe impact on agriculture operations, Pongal festivities appear to be rather subdued in the city with traders in the city reporting relatively poor sales of jaggery, sugar cane, brass ware and other items.Both wholesale and retail traders feel they have not witnessed such a critical situation in the last few decades. A. Jayaraman, a brassware seller on Big Bazaar Street, said he stocked about 150 Pongal pots about a couple of weeks ago in anticipation of good demand. But, to my surprise, there has been little takers this season, he said. Brass pots form an essential component in the Pongal seer gifted to the newly-weds.The patronage from rural people is on a low key this year, indicating the impact of drought on samba paddy, banana and sugar cane crops, said R. Selvam, a member of Gandhi Market Vellamandi Merchants Association.He stocks 15 varieties of jaggery for the festival. Mr. Selvam said demonetisation also had its adverse impact on cash flow in rural areas. Although two months had lapsed, cash flow has not eased in rural areas, he said explaining the fall in purchasing capacity of villagers.Worst-hit are the dealers in turmeric. Traders at Thillai Nagar, Woraiyur Market and Gandhi Market sold turmeric bunches at Rs. 60, Rs. 50, Rs. 30 and Rs. 20, depending on the size and growth of the root.Kumar, a retail dealer at Gandhi Market, said the market was dull as people bargained.He said the price had doubled in comparison to last year. I. Thembal, another retail dealer at the market, said the quality of turmeric had come down due to poor irrigation and failure of monsoon.Too many cane sellersTraders of Pongal sugar cane said there was not much increase in the price of the edible variety of the cane. Many traders were in the business leading to stiff competition. As the produce must be marketed within a couple of days, they vied with one another. Arrivals were good from Tirukattupalli area in Thanjavur district and Tiruvalarcholai in Tiruchi district. S. Sudarshan, a retail dealer in Thillai Nagar, said he sold the cane for Rs. 35 each. He owns a carriage vehicle on which he had brought the produce from his brothers field in Tirukattupalli. With relatively lesser transport expenses, I could withstand the stiff competition, he said.In Pudukottai district, the Pongal sugar cane growers of Chellukudi, Sirunchunai and Perunchunai villages said they had to take extra effort to irrigate the fields as they had taken advance from wholesale dealers. It had to be sold within a couple of days during Bhogi and Pongal festival days. In villages, it is customary to offer five bundles of sugar cane as Pongal gift to the loved ones, said Manickam, one of the farmers."

The direction sought by the petitioner cannot be sought through a PIL, the First Bench of Acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G. Ramesh and M. Sundar said while dismissing the PIL moved by an advocate.According to the petitioner, there are 1.95 crore family card holders in Tamil Nadu, and out if it, about 1.85 crore card holders are availing of rice and other products from fair price shops run by the Consumer and Civil Supplies Department of the State government at subsidised rates.Supplies cutNoting that the main beneficiaries of such schemes are people below the poverty line and the middle class, the petitioner claimed that in recent days, there was shortage of supply in such shops. Previously, 20 kg of rice per month was supplied to the card holders; but now, it has been reduced to 10 kg. Also, the free of cost rice given to people below the poverty line has been stopped, and instead, wheat is being provided, the petitioner alleged.Relying on media reports for his allegations, the petitioner submitted that it is the duty of the State government to guarantee availability of food for its citizens.

Sreenivasan, a sugarcane farmer, said the cultivation of cane had come down by 45 per cent in the area.In an ideal condition, a farmer used to harvest about 40 to 50 tonnes of sugarcane per acre but the drought had brought down the yield to 10 tonnes per acre. The quality of cane had also been affected by shortage of water, he said.Even borewells dug deep are of no use, said R. Ramamurthi, another sugarcane farmer at Ramanathapuram. There are around 150 borewells in the area but have become of no use as the groundwater table has come down, he said.The situation is almost similar at other places the team visited.Adhi, a farmer at Katterikuppam, said sugarcane, paddy and banana crops had come down by 75 per cent owing to failure of monsoon.Paddy cultivation had come down by at least 50 per cent, said Raman, another farmer at Katterikupppam.A borewell during a normal time could be used to cultivate sugarcane on five acres of land but in the present condition, not even one acre could be irrigated, he said.In Sorapet village, farmers complained about huge loss incurred in red bean cultivation. Krishnaveni, who used to cultivate red beans on about eight acres said she was struggling to get a reasonable yield this time. According to Krishnaveni, a farmer used to harvest 78 bags of red beans per acre but the drought had reduced the yield to around 25 bags. She also complained about unfair practices adopted by the Market Committee which procures their produce.Milk producers complained to the team about scarcity of paddy straw that is used as primary fodder for cattle. S. Mohana Raman, a resident of Sorapet, said farmers are forced to sell their cows owing to lack of availability of paddy straw. In the absence of vegetation, farmers find it difficult to feed the cattle, he said.In a memorandum to the Central team, Puducherry Vivasaigal Sangam said the failure of monsoon had affected Samba, Thaladi and Kuruvai crops in Puducherry and Karaikal regions.

Also, the report added that but for the steroids administered for atopic dermatitis (a skin condition), she was only on drugs to control her blood sugar and blood pressure.The elaborate treatment reports indicate that there were periods (at least two) in which Jayalalithaa interacted with family members and officials at her bedside. However, the records note her deteriorating condition necessitating invasive ventilation.As is in the public realm, she was moved out of the ICU into a high dependency unit where she continued to receive physiotherapy (from a Singapore-based team) in addition to being closely monitored by doctors and nurses.Jayalalithaa suffered a massive cardiac arrest on the evening of December 4, 2016, even while the intensivist from Apollo Hospitals was in her room, as has been reported earlier. When cardio pulmonary resuscitation failed, she was provided ECMO support within an hour, to revive her.

Besides asking the Centre to continue to share the burden of subsidy, the State is thinking of increasing the price of sugar sold at fair price shops (FPS) from Rs. 13.50 per half a kg to Rs. 20, sources said.The State government is now purchasing sugar form open market through e-tenders. The government distributes half a kg of sugar to each cardholder per month at a price of Rs. 13.50 per kg. The subsidy used to be borne by both Central and state governments. The Centre used to share Rs. 10.53 crore per month and the State Rs. 10.41 crore. The Central government used to reimburse subsidy at the rate of Rs. 18,500 per metric tonne (MT), sources say. The net requirement of sugar in the State is 7,040 MT per month. Due to scrapping of subsidy by the Centre, the government will have to shoulder the burden of Rs. 20.94 crore per month.The requirement goes up during special occasions like Ramzan when Government distributes RamzanTohfa (gift). Under the scheme, the government supplies 2-kg sugar to Muslim BPL cardholders. The expenditure will touch Rs. 8.69 crore for subsidised sugar under the Tohfa.

This is the tenth consecutive year that the Adheenam has been organising the celebration to honour the farmers.Speaking on the occasion, Dayananda Chandrasekara Swamigal, head of the Adheenam, said farmers were seen toiling hard in four villages -- Therkku Thoppupatti, Kovilur, Vamban Four Road area and Kothakottai. Severe drought-prone condition had been a challenge to them, he said.R. Kaliyaperumla, secretary of Navalar Naattar College, honoured the farmers with Pongal gift that included jaggery, sweets, sugarcane and clothes, besides a certificate.S. Ramadas, chairman of Ponmari group of educational institutions and R.

Kanagaraj, a farmer of Kothakottai, said that though the project had been mooted decades ago, it was yet to be implemented. The project, if implemented, would not only ensure assured irrigation for Pudukottai and neighbouring districts but also stabilise ground water table.Papathi Ganesan, another farmer from Theruku Thoppupatti said that a survey was conducted, after the floods in 2005, for diverting the surplus water from Coleroon in Tiruchi to the water-starved Pudukottai district. In 2005, large volume of water was let off into the Bay of Bengal.They explained that the drought-prone condition had forced the agricultural labourers to rely on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme."

It is probably the high time that the Centre levied additional taxes on foods with added sugar and salt and saturated fats, despite the objections to such a move.A group of secretaries has submitted a proposal to the Prime Minister on this, and recommended that the additional revenue be diverted to the health budget.Awareness crucialDirector General of the Indian Council of Medical Research Soumya Swaminathan said that these foods were partly responsible for the non-communicable diseases in the country.But additional tax alone wouldnt solve the problem  awareness was also crucial, as were other factors.This experiment in other countries has shown positive results, she said. City-based experts say the proposal, if accepted, could have a positive impact on public health.V. Mohan, chairman, Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialties Centre, explained: Sugar is known to have a direct link with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of cutting down on sugar can be seen on weight in months, especially in children. It also has an effect on pre-diabetics  eliminating sugar can help prevent those with pre-diabetes from progressing to diabetes, he said.Dr. Mohan said that Tamil Nadu has around 3.5 million people with diabetes and about 3 million who are pre-diabetic. A study by his centre in Chennai some years ago on 25,000 school-going children had revealed that over 25 per cent of those in private schools and over eight per cent of those in government schools were either overweight or obese.A tax on sugared drinks will increase their price and act as a deterrent to the public  and it has been shown to work in the case of tobacco, said Madhan Kumar, president, Indian Association of Public Health Dentistry.But it would only be useful with education on the ill effects of sugar on health, he said. Sucrose, he said, is proven to have a role in the formation of dental caries and in gum disease.The Indian population consumes twice or even three times the World Health Organisations permissible limit of salt intake a day, which is five grams, said Rajan Ravichandran, director, MIOT Institute of Nephrology. A study in Tamil Nadu five years ago showed over 30 per cent of adults and 5 per cent of school children had hypertension, he said, adding that the tax would be a good move, but that food variants with lower salt levels and tax rebates should also be made available. Salt consumption is directly linked to hypertension which is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease, he said. Obesity, diabetes and hypertension are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, said K. Kannan, Head of Cardiology at Government Stanley Hospital. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Tamil Nadu is between 11 and 12 per cent in the adult population, he said."

Photo M. VedhanM_VEDHANTruckloads of sugarcane heralding the Pongal festival have started arriving in the city. This time however, they are pegged at just half the usual price.The drought across many parts of the State has had an impact on the arrivals at the Koyambedu wholesale market this time. Its a double whammy for traders at the market, who have to tackle fewer arrivals and less demand due to the cash crunch in the wake of demonetisation.Though the number of trucks bringing sugarcane doubled to 400 on Thursday, it was still far less when compared to last year, noted traders.A. Dhanakodi, a trader from Soorakottai near Thanjavur, said: I bring sugarcane from Soorakottai and Madurai. A bundle of sugarcane consisting 20 pieces is usually sold for Rs. 500. But, this time, it is being sold for only Rs. 200-300.The shortage of cash has brought down the demand and prices have also dropped. I will have to return with just a marginal profit.The city market gets its sugarcane loads from Madurai, Tiruchi, Salem and parts of Andhra Pradesh. P. Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said a single piece of sugarcane was being sold for Rs. 18-20 at the market. During Pongal, we make brisk business for four days. But, this time, sales have come down by half because of the cash crunch and fewer arrivals, he added.Traders noted that several truckloads of sugarcane were still in stock and waiting to be sold as there were no takers. S. Chandran, a wholesale trader, said Only 5-6 truckloads of turmeric bunches and ginger arrived on Thursday. Last year, we were receiving 20 trucks at this point of this time. A bundle of turmeric is priced at Rs. 70. Similarly, prices of most vegetables have also remained stable for a month now because of the decrease in demand.However, some retail traders were in for a surprise as the prices of banana escalated on Thursday owing to fewer arrivals. S. Khader, a retailer from Avadi, was negotiating prices at the market. The cost of the produce is usually fixed through an auction. I had to pay up to Rs. 600 for banana bunches that otherwise cost Rs. 200. I had no choice other than to reduce the purchase to manage with the cash I brought, he said."

PHOTO: G. KarthikeyanG_KARTHIKEYAN - G_KARTHIKEYAN: Sharp slump in yield and cut in procurement price owing to failure of monsoon and cash crisis haunt cane growers in the district for this Pongal festival.Procurement prices of sugarcane hovers between Rs.155 and Rs.165 per bundle containing 10 canes in Chinnamanur, a major cane production centre in the district, which was between Rs.200 and Rs.220 per bundle last year. Arrival of outstation farmers for this season too has come down sharply, thanks to cash crisis owing to demonetisation.Last year traders from Tirunvelveli, Virudhunagar, Tuticorin and Nagercoil had procured sugarcane in large numbers making on-the-spot cash payment to farmers.Now the condition is very bad. With no money flow, outstation traders arrival has come down sharply. But local traders have thriving business. They lift sugarcane to northern states.In some pockets, cane growers have gone to the level of selling cane to traders merely on assurance of transferring money to their bank accounts. Sometimes, local traders take responsibility for settling the cash for the cane procured by outstation traders. Only a few traders make spot payment, says R. Ganesan of Chinnamanur.Size, quality affectedSugarcane yield is also less in some pockets in Chinnamanur owing to shortage of rain. Size, quality and length too are not as expected, he adds. Normally, we get around 1,500 bundles per acre. But we got around 1,100 to 1,200 bundles this season, 20 per cent cut in yield when compared to last year, he said.However, harvesting has been done on a war footing in Chinnamanur and nearby areas as farmers had to clear the field before Pongal. We have to clear the field today or tomorrow, failing which, we cannot sell it after Pongal festival.Cane growers in Dindigul too have been facing similar fate.Cane procurement price hovers between Rs.200 to Rs.250 per bundle which was almost the same during the last season. With poor takers, farmers have to bear cutting and packing charges. We have to shell out Rs.1000 for cutting, packing and dumping in vehicles.Normally, I get 60 lorry loads of cane per acre. But I have got only 40 lorry loads this year. I had purchased water to protect the standing crop till harvest. With increase in production costs, sale price will not match production costs. Cane quality too has come down owing to water shortage.However, traders from Karur, Erode, and Oddanchatram, Vedasandur have been procuring cane from Vakkampati, Chettinaickanpatti and nearby areas."

Jacob John, a virologist who was earlier attached to the Christian Medical College, (CMC) Vellore says.They quote our study but dont honestly say what we have found. If they did that then they cant claim originality. They have done a large case-control study but borrowed all important information connected with the illness from us, he argues.Dr. John published in 2014 evidence of a link between a fruit in Jamaica, the ackee, from the same family as litchi, and a disease called acute encephalopathy in Jamaicans. He showed the close clinical similarity between ackee poisioning and the Muzaffarpur illness, where litchi consumption and skipping the evening meal could result in very low blood glucose and acute encephalopathy, leading to seizures and coma, and death in many cases.Authors refute claimThe Lancet authors, however, refute this. We have acknowledged and cited all three of Dr. John and his colleagues papers in Current Science , Dr. Padmini Srikantiah at CDC Atlanta and the corresponding author said in an email. There are a few key findings in our study that have not been, to our knowledge, reported previously. First: the evidence of the metabolites of hypoglycin A and methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG) in the specimens of affected children, and the demonstrated metabolic abnormalities that resulted due to the effects of these toxins. And, second, a statistically significant epidemiological association between illness and litchi consumption, as well as the modifying effect of the absence of an evening meal.Dr. Johns team had in a May 2014 paper in Current Science pointed out that the illness was due to non-infectious encephalopathy and not viral encephalitis as was widely suspected. That it was a form of encephalopathy associated with low blood sugar was again emphasised in a August 2014 paper in Current Science .A December 2015 Current Science paper reported presence of MCPG in litchi ; but not MCPG or hypoglycin A in samples of children. But the study strongly suggested the role of MCPG.Our finding provides the much needed evidence for biological plausibility that litchi consumption by undernourished children, especially after prolonged fasting, triggers the hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, early in the morning, the paper says.Dr. Jacob Johns team said the illness was due to non-infectious encephalopathy and not viral encephalitis"

58f4f15d7be9e0185109fe00,Slaughterhouse ban & laptops on BJP list,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170129/jsp/nation/story_132902.jsp,2017-01-29,"Amit Shah releases the party manifesto in Lucknow on Saturday for the Assembly elections.Picture by Naeem Ansari Lucknow, Jan. 28: The BJP has said it would shut down all slaughterhouses in Uttar Pradesh and gift laptops to all students entering college, in its election manifesto released here today by party president Amit Shah. Shah did not mention cow slaughter, which is banned in the state, but promised that all slaughterhouses - including the mechanised ones that operate under licence from the government - would be closed immediately if the BJP came to power. Slaughter of buffalo and of bull or bullock over the age of 15 and unfit for breeding is permitted in Uttar Pradesh. In September 2015, Dadri resident Mohammed Akhlaque was lynched by a mob that stormed his house on suspicion that he had slaughtered a cow. For about a year after that there had been a spurt in incidents of cow vigilantism, but these have now abated. ""Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had given laptops to the members of a particular caste. But we will give free laptop to the youths of all the castes and communities when they join a college, along with 1GB Internet data free per month,"" the BJP manifesto promised. The reference was to a scheme of the Akhilesh government under which laptops were given free to all eligible students who had passed the intermediate exams. Although the scheme was for students of all communities, the BJP has often alleged that only Yadav students got the laptops. The 25-page manifesto, titled Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra, also returns to the Ram temple promise. It says: ""The BJP repeats its view on Ram temple - all the possibilities under the preview of the Constitution would be found out for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya."" Shah said: ""This is something everybody is waiting to hear from us."" Asked why the BJP takes up the issue, which is pending in the Supreme Court, during elections and forgets thereafter, Shah said: ""We don't forget it. The hearing of the case will be held there in the SC after two days. I am saying we are looking for every option available under the constitutional norms."" This was the only issue in the manifesto that did not spell out the BJP's plan -whether the Narendra Modi government would try to enact a legislation in Parliament to hand over the disputed Ayodhya land to the Hindus or wait for the court verdict. The manifesto also promises legal assistance to Muslim women who have been a ""victim of triple talaq"". ""The state government will provide legal assistance to those Muslim women who want to fight against triple talaq,"" Shah said. Trying to keep those in good humour who expect the BJP to stick to its Hindutva agenda, the manifesto has promised to develop a ""cultural tourist circuit"" covering the important religious centres of Mathura, Ayodhya, Prayag (Allahabad), Vindhyachal, Chitrakoot, Kushinagar and Varanasi. At the same time, the party also went all out to woo the youths, farmers and Scheduled Castes. It promised 70 lakh jobs, 10 universities of international standard, engineering or polytechnic college in every district, free Wi-fi in colleges and universities, and free education for girls up to graduation. The document has four pages of promises for farmers, including waiving of bank loans of small and marginal farmers and giving then interest-free new loans. They constitute 90 per cent of the farmers in the state. ""The farmers will get a cheque against their sugarcane the moment the mills buy it. Bank loans would also be provided to landless farmers,"" Shah said. The scholarship of Dalit students would be increased and they would be provided loan on low interest rates for higher education. Reacting to the manifesto, Mayawati said: ""It is a bunch of jokes against the people. The BJP, during 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign, had promised Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every Indian and later on Shah dubbed it as mere jumla (idiomatic or empty statement). Modi has not fulfilled even one-fourth of the promises he had made to the people during parliamentary elections. Now they are promising moon to the people of the state."" Akhilesh said: ""I had said earlier that the BJP would imitate me in its manifesto and the same has happened. They have stolen from my manifesto of 2012 in which I had promised laptops to youths, free education to girls and empowering police helpline. I have fulfilled all these promises. The BJP should have spent some time in innovating new ideas instead of stealing my old ideas."""
58f4f2ca7be9e018510a0099,Contraband racket worry for police,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170116/jsp/odisha/story_130510.jsp,2017-01-16,"Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: Police claimed to have seized 634 grams of brown sugar from various places across the city last year and touted it as a major achievement for the force. In reality, however, network of drug peddlers remains widespread and they have managed to turn Bhubaneswar into a haven for peddling contraband. The seizure of brown sugar having a market value of Rs 60 lakh was the highest in a single year since the inception of a separate commissionerate in 2008. According to official statistics, the cops managed to recover only 8.7 grams of brown sugar in Bhubaneswar between 2011 and 2015. While there was no seizure of the contraband between 2011 and 2014, the police recovered 8.7 grams in 2015 alone. Several residents felt that the failure of the police to crack down on peddlers five years ago had resulted in the proliferation of the brown sugar racket. ""The sale of brown sugar was low five years back. Most peddlers were involved in the ganja trade at that time. Besides, the sale of brown sugar was restricted to habitual addicts,"" a police official said, on the condition of anonymity. Sources said over the years, the peddlers have started adopting different ways to conceal the contraband. ""It's very difficult to conceal ganja, which is procured in kilograms. But in the case of brown sugar, the peddlers have become very smart. During raids, we have found peddlers hiding the drug inside shoes, ice cream containers and even in rice containers, which makes it difficult for us to seize it,"" said a city excise official. The contraband is mostly smuggled into Odisha from states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bengal. Small time traders in slums procure it from Balasore and its adjoining areas and sell it in the capital at hefty margins. The city police decided to crack down on drug peddling after an engineering student died of an overdose of an alleged brown sugar overdose last May. ""The most difficult part of detecting such rackets is gathering intelligence. We have to often depend on addicts, but they cannot be relied on completely. If we send decoys, the peddlers don't sell to them out of suspicion,"" said another police official. Deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi said the police had created a database of the city's peddlers, who have been arrested in the past. ""We have directed local police stations to keep track of the peddlers after they are released on bail. Besides, we are keeping a close watch on slums where the contraband is sold,"" said Bhoi."

(PTI) Jalalabad, Jan. 28: Rahul Gandhi today accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of backing the ""most corrupt person in the country"" - Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. ""Corruption is most rampant in this state and Sukhbir Badal is the symbol of that. Modiji comes to Punjab and says he is against corruption, but backs Sukhbir - the most corrupt person in the country,"" Rahul claimed at a rally in Sukhbir's seat, Jalalabad. In the February 4 Punjab elections, Sukhbir is pitted against the Aam Aadmi Party's Bhagwant Mann and Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, the grandson of slain chief minister Beant Singh. ""Every person in Punjab knows Sukhbir is corrupt, yet Modiji takes his side. Why is he by his side? This election will decide whether the people of Punjab are correct or Modiji,"" added Rahul. The Congress vice-president, on a three-day visit to Punjab, ends his campaign tomorrow in Lambi, the constituency of chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. Modi at a rally in Panaji on Saturday. (PTI) Modi is slated to address his second poll meeting in Moga's Kotakpura tomorrow. Yesterday, in Jalandhar, Modi had hit out at the Congress for aligning with the Samajwadi Party for the Uttar Pradesh polls. Congress sources said Rahul gunned for the ruling Akali Dal, the BJP's ally, to target Modi. ""Rahul questioned the reasons behind the BJP's courting the Akali Dal, which is corrupt and pursues a sectarian agenda,"" said a Congress leader. ""Be it running of TV channels or the transport sector, the Badals have a finger in every pie. Nobody sets up industry here because the Badals won't allow anyone to come without demanding a share."" Apart from Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh, cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu was present at Rahul's rally in Jalalabad's Dana Mandi, around 278km from Chandigarh. Rahul told the people that some schemes the Akalis were tom-tomming as their own had been implemented because of the Food Security Act put in place by the Congress-led UPA regime and the funds provided to the state. After coming to power in 2007, the Akali regime had launched the atta-dal scheme to provide subsidised flour and pulses at Re 1 per kg and Rs 20 per kg respectively to people owning less than 2.5 acres and earning less than Rs 60,000 per annum. The scheme covers around 1.42 crore people at present. If returned to power, Sukhbir has promised to include sugar and ghee under the scheme. ""The atta-dal scheme happened because of the Food Security Act of the UPA government. The scheme is Manmohan Singh's but the Akalis carry their photo on the project,"" Rahul said. ""We also gave the right to rural employment. Unfortunately, the funds the UPA gave Punjab were misused by the Akali-BJP government."" Rahul also trained his guns on Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. ""Ask your relatives and friends who stay in Delhi whether they are happy, and they will tell you 'no'. The Delhi municipal corporation polls are approaching and the Aam Aadmi Party will get a battering,"" Rahul claimed."
