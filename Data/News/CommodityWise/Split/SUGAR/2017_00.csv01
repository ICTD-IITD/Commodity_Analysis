Bujarbaruah addresses the gathering on Saturday. Telegraph pictureJorhat, Jan. 28: A brainstorming session held at the Assam Agricultural University here today discussed which crops were best suited to the ecology of a particular area, soil fertility and climate change.The session was on Regional Crop Planning for Improving Resource Use Efficiency and Sustainability project, which aims to prepare a crop map for the Northeast by March.The project under National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research-ICAR is being conducted by the department of agricultural economics, AAU, since July 2013.AAU vice-chancellor K.M. Bujarbaruah said while preparing the road map, scientists should hold discussions with farmers. The outcome ultimately depends on the farmer, who has to get maximum return with minimum cost and inputs, he said.Regarding climate change, Bujarbaruah said in the last two years heavy rainfall had occurred in March and April and this could indicate that sowing season should start from May instead of July.He asked the National Bureau of Soil Sciences to come up with a land use plan based on soil survey.Rajni Jain, principal investigator, NIAP-ICAR, while highlighting its work, said in Punjab and Maharashtra groundwater and soil fertility had declined sharply.""Due to heavy use of fertilisers and groundwater, agriculture in Punjab is staring at a crisis,"" she said. Farmers in the state have taken to sowing paddy instead of traditional crops like gram, wheat and groundnut, she added.In Maharashtra, the largescale sugarcane plantations are facing threats from pests and outside sources.K.C. Talukdar, head of department, agricultural economics, said the vastness of the Northeast could be gauged by the existence of 40 ecological situations. Expressing concern over shrinking land and climate change, he cautioned against overuse and misuse of resources.Nivedita Deka, principal investigator and scientist of the project, said a specific plan had been prepared for Assam and the region had been divided into six zones - north bank plain, upper Brahmaputra valley, central Brahmaputra valley, lower Brahmaputra valley, Barak valley and the hills.G.N. Hazarika, director of research, spoke of misutilisation of fertilisers by farmers.K. Karunakaran of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, A. Kumar, researcher from Samastipur, S. Srivastava of NIAP-ICAR, Arunima Bhattacharyya, state consultant, and S. Ray of National Bureau of Soil Sciences, participated in the workshop."

It also asked the Central government to extend the rice procurement period for three months.Kerala had rolled out the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in November 2016, under which foodgrains are sold to the poor at a highly subsidised rate of Rs.1-Rs.3 a kg via the public distribution system (PDS), also called ration shops.The Kerala Chief Minister has placed many demands before us. One is increasing foodgrains allocation under the NFSA, Mr. Paswan told reporters after the meeting.In the meeting, sources said that the Chief Minister demanded that the State be given foodgrains for PDS supply that it used to get before implementing the NFSA.Under the NFSA, the State is getting 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains annually, lower than 16.25 lakh tonnes earlier.Uniform formulaTo this, the Food Minister said that a uniform formula has been applied to all States while allocating foodgrains under the food security law.Allocation under the NFSA is being made taking into account the last three years average foodgrains lifting of the State. And the average was 10 lakh tonnes per annum for Kerala. But more is being given to protect poor people, a senior Food Ministry official said.Kerala is asking for more allocation under the NFSA as it wants to cover the entire population. It has also asked for paraboiled rice and additional foodgrains allocation of about 50,000 tonnes a month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the State. PTI"

The main contributor to slower inflation was the softening in food prices, with inflation in the food and beverages category of the CPI falling below the 2% mark (1.98%) for the first time since January 2012.Retail inflation at 3.41% in December 2016 is on expected lines reflecting the combined effect of demonetisation and seasonality on food particularly fruits and vegetables, Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings & Research said. However, prices of food items such as sugar which is in double digit and cereals whose prices are showing upward escalation are cause for worry. On the other hand, fuel inflation is trending upwards, with the fuel and light segment seeing inflation accelerate to 3.77% in December compared with 2.8% in November."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Feb. 21: Preparations are on in full swing for Shivratri celebrations at the Lingaraj Temple. The religious festival will be observed on February 24. Police are making elaborate security arrangements for the event, which is attended by lakhs of devotees. The police said traffic management would be the primary focus for the festival preparations. ""Thirty platoons of police will be deployed to maintain law and traffic. Our plainclothesmen will also be deployed to keep a watch on snatchers and other criminal elements. Around 100 police officers will be deployed at the venue,"" said deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi. The temple administration has asked the police to control the crowd on the temple premises, while the rituals are being performed. ""A special cordon will be made inside the temple during the rituals. Traffic will be controlled in and around the temple,"" said a police official. To ensure safe parking of vehicles, the police have earmarked several spaces in and around the area as parking lots. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation will deploy its personnel to provide drinking water to the devotees, besides undertaking sanitation work around the temple. Authorities said 14 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed in and around the temple would keep a watch on the movement of both the devotees and trouble-mongers. Two control rooms have also been set up - one inside the temple administration office and the other at Lingaraj police station - to monitor the CCTV footage. ""Last year, the parking lots around the temple were not adequate, which created much difficulty for the devotees. Thousands of devotees were forced to walk more than one kilometre to reach the temple. The temperature has been quite high over the past few days. The authorities should ensure that they set up adequate parking lots, so that devotees need not walk long distances,"" said Abhijit Das, a devotee. Brown sugar seized Police today arrested a 32-year-old man after finding 15 grams of brown sugar from his possession. The accused, identified as Chiku Swain, was nabbed by police last night while he was on his way to sell the contraband at Nayapalli."

58f4fd1a7be9e018510a1010,Note scrap big minus: Jamir,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170223/jsp/odisha/story_137197.jsp,2017-02-23,"Governor SC Jamir in the Assembly in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday. Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Feb. 22: The state government today admitted that demonetisation had hit the state economy hard. ""It has brought about a steep deceleration of the state's economy and public finances in the initial period. It is evidenced by a decline of over 11 per cent in tax collection in December 2016 over the previous month,"" said governor S.C. Jamir in his customary address in the Assembly today. The governor said the impact of demonetisation of specified bank notes on the economy was yet to be assessed fully. ""However, in the aftermath of withdrawal of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 denominations, economic activity has been interrupted in the segments which are cash intensive,"" he said. Stressing that the state has achieved significant improvement in finance through various fiscal reforms, Jamir said the effort to achieve debt sustainability from a position of debt stress was significant. The debt gross state domestic product ratio had been brought down to 15.7 per cent in 2015-16 from 50.7 per cent in 2002-03. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had promptly supported the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ban the Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes from November 8. In turn, he was praised by Modi and his cabinet colleagues including Union finance minister Arun Jaitley. Naveen is part of a chief ministers' committee, headed by his Andhra Pradesh counterpart Chandrababu Naidu, to promote digital payment system for the sake of fiscal transparency, financial inclusion and also prepare a roadmap to follow post-demonetisation. However, the state government has been highlighting the problems faced by the people of Odisha from time to time. In December, finance minister Pradeep Amat had told the Assembly that the state was facing an acute shortage of Rs 100 and Rs 500 currency notes, and the banks were getting only one third of their requirement of these notes. On November 16, Naveen had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to reconsider the decision not to allow co-operative banks to receive and exchange the scrapped notes. Naveen had also requested the Prime Minister not to make PAN card mandatory for tribal people visiting banks to deposit or withdraw cash as most of them did not have these cards, The council of ministers of the state today approved the budget proposals to the tune of Rs 1.06 lakh crore for 2017-18 financial year. On Monday, the state government will present the budget in the state Assembly. Late in the evening, the state cabinet approved 10 proposals including the one for revision of sales tax and value added tax. The cabinet also gave its nod to the proposal to pay compensation to the entire village if 75 per cent land of its land is acquired for an irrigation project. The state government will also stand guarantee for the loan to be availed by the Aska Cooperative Sugar Mill for its revival."

The unseasonal rain came as a huge relief to both farmers and residents.The rain spell, though much delayed and inadequate still, is expected to be beneficial for the standing cash crops such as banana, sugarcane and betelvine, besides the rainfed crops such as maize and cotton.There was sharp showers accompanied by strong winds. Banana trees in some fields were left leaning and farmers will have to incur more expenditure to lift them and provide support to them. However, the rain will be somewhat useful for the crop in the flowering stage. We need more rain, said K. Murali, a farmer of Kuzhumani.Tiruchi city received sharp showers in the afternoon followed by intermittent drizzle. Nandhiyar Head recorded the maximum of 31 mm rainfall till 4 p.m. during the day.

58f4fdbfa3d24b0b70c1be9a,Focussing on the marginal farmer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Focussing-on-the-marginal-farmer/article17057550.ece,2017-01-19,"The sluice gate on the Bhakra main line canal in Khanauri-Kalan village in Sangrur district, Punjab, has become infamous. According to reports, it is a suicide point for farmers and their families. Typically, 30-45 corpses are found in the canal on average every month. Farmers suicide in Punjab is a major worry: over 2,632 farmers are reported to have committed suicide between 1995 and 2015,in the land famed for its Green Revolution, according to State government records. Mansa district alone accounts for 1,334 suicides. Adding farm labourers raises the total to 4,687 reported suicides. The reasons for this vary: cotton crop has been whittled by whiteflies, basmatis market price has declined, the local moneylender has hiked up rates to 20 per cent. The farmer ekes his way to penury.Farmer suicides are not a new trend. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 2,195 marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in 2015 (of which 834 were in Maharashtra), while 3,618 small farmers undertook such drastic steps, with Maharashtra alone seeing 1,285. More curiously, a larger number of small farmers rather than marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in States like Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka. Somehow, small farmers are also bedevilled by the agricultural crisis, and this is not the case in just the traditional drought-stricken States.On input costsAgriculture in States like Punjab is typically a monoculture of wheat and paddy. When input costs associated with fertilizers, crop-protection chemicals and seeds rose, along with fixed costs associated with agricultural equipment such as tractors and submersible pumps, agriculture became economically unviable. Prices have risen  of arhar seeds and staple crops like paddy and sugarcane, of fertilizers and plain barley. The old days of farmers handing seeds as family heirlooms to their sons are long gone. Hiring labourers and animals is expensive. With an increase in application of crop-protection chemicals, soya bean has seen a massive jump in pesticide cost. Given a jump in input costs, cultivation costs have gone up in multiples. The total cost of cultivation for wheat rose three times from 2004-05 to 2012-13.While traditionally the blame is cast on the usurious local moneylender, NCRB data highlight that 2,474 of the 3,000 farmers who were reported to have committed suicide in 2015 had loans from local banks, while those who had loans from moneylenders were just 9.8 per cent of the total. Maharashtra reported 1,293 such suicides for indebtedness, while Karnataka had 946. Meanwhile, farmers in Punjab are estimated to have an outstanding debt of Rs. 69,355 crore. Somehow, the traditional moneylender is seemingly more flexible than local banks.Retailoring agricultureSolving this crisis requires an inclusive approach. Our policies should encourage integrated pest management, an approach that focusses on combining biological, chemical, mechanical and physical means to combat pests with a long-term emphasis on eliminating or significantly reducing the need for pesticides. In Vietnam, over 2 million of the Mekong Deltas rice farmers adopted a no spray early rule, curbing insecticide applications within the first 40 days of rice planting. Predatory beetles that commonly prey on rice pests were sustained, encouraging the crop while cutting pesticide use by over 50 per cent.The local fertilizer industry needs support  timely delivery of subsidies would improve working capital requirements, enabling them to manage costs through internal sources rather than external loans. Delayed payments can cause an interest outgo of Rs. 3,500 crore for fertilizer firms annually. State seed policies should focus on encouraging contract farming, along with identification of new genotypes for treating pest and disease syndromes, as well as adverse weather conditions. Precision-farming techniques like Systematic Rice Intensification can help increase seed production in this regard.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment and implements that are currently imported. Subsidies should be rerouted to ensure lower collateral requirements, longer moratoriums and payback periods for farmers seeking to buy equipment and entrepreneurs seeking to setup Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) for agricultural equipment. Companies with a corporate social responsibility focus on agriculture can be further encouraged to invest in capacity-building initiatives, skill development and the establishment of CHCs.We need to ensure that institutional financing is available and accessible and benefit provision is simplified while disbursed funds are effectively monitored. States should seek to establish early warning signals, monitoring farmers who go past set limits and seek unsustainable loans. Village-wise lists of deeply indebted farmers must be prepared annually to identify farmers on the flight path to penury and potential suicide. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, along with the local administration, should be tasked with analysing such lists for macro and local policy interventions, along with devising timely loan restructuring initiatives, insurance claim settlements and better counselling.Finally, such individuals must be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Given the hard struggle of making a living in agriculture these days, such farmers face big odds for sustaining their families and educating their children. Travelling through the by-lanes of suicide-stricken villages in Bijnor, Bahraich, Kheri, Allahabad, Aligarh and Moradabad is a humbling and disconcerting experience. Even distributing Rs.50,000 per distraught marginal farmer family has had little impact; so deep is the scale of agrarian distress. Our efforts in crowdfunding have been a palliative for over 3,000 farmers, but only systemic change can transform their situation. The marginal farmer requires more than just hope now.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency for the BJP.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment that is currently imported"

Picture by Ashok Sinha A 23-year-old BBA degree holder is serving hygiene with the regular sugarcane juice you have on roadsides. The Ganna Caf - a first-of-its-kind initiative in Patna - has come up on Boring Canal Road around a month ago. Patna boy Lokesh Rajgiri has turned a van into a customised shop by spending Rs 1.5 lakh. He spent another Rs 2 lakh on buying a crusher and a deep freezer machine and invested Rs 1.5 lakh on sugarcanes. That's how The Ganna Caf was born. The cafe, which initially received five to 10 customers a day, now gets around 400 to 500 daily. While roadside sugarcane juice sellers extract the juice with bare hands in their open makeshift stalls, for Rajgiri it's hygiene first. He wears gloves throughout his work. Also, the juice is provided in a disposable glass whereas roadside shops serve juice in the same glass used by other customers. On how he got the idea of starting a sugarcane juice shop, Rajgiri said when he was in his final year of Bachelor of Business Administration at Hyderabad's College of Commerce in 2014, he got the idea of selling sugarcane in a customised van in a neat set-up. ""In Hyderabad, I saw people selling sugarcane juice by using crusher machines. I found it easy to extract the juice through the crusher. In Patna, I had only seen sugarcane extraction machines, which work manually. However, turning a van into a customised shop for selling sugarcane juice was my idea. The idea was to sell sugarcane juice in a hygienic set-up. There are people who avoid going to roadside sugarcane juice sellers because they sell juice in unhygienic ways on open stalls. I thought why not sell juice in a shop but to make it attractive, I bought a van and customised it with cool interiors and exteriors,"" said Lokesh. He said by converting a van into a customised shop, he also saved money that he would otherwise had to spend on renting or purchasing a shop. Rajgiri said maintaining quality of the product will be his main focus. ""I don't add water or ice in the juice like traditional sugarcane juice sellers do because it affects the quality. I put skin-scraped sugarcane into the deep freezer for a few minutes so that it gets chilled. The chilled sugarcane sticks are put into the crusher to extract the juice,"" said Lokesh. He added: ""While traditional juice sellers put the sugarcane sticks into the manual extraction machine twice and thrice to extract its juice, I put the canes only once into the crusher to extract the juice. The juice at my shop is not only hygienic but also good in quality."" To add to this, the juice comes in flavours. ""Nimbuda (lime), chat-pata, jaljeera, adrakhi, pudina and jhal ras. They range from Rs 10 to Rs 20 per glass,"" he said. Rajgiri's customers gave the product a thumbs up. One of them, Animesh Bharti, said: ""I discovered the shop two days back. I avoided drinking sugarcane juice from roadside stalls but when I saw the juice being sold in a shop here, I thought to try it and found the service good. I have come here for the second time."""

Picture by Dwijodas Ghosh Suri, March 4: A patient's death allegedly prompted his relatives to assault a doctor and a nurse at a private nursing home in Birbhum today after accusing the facility of negligence and attempts to overcharge them. The relatives of Sheikh Jardish, also accused of ransacking the nursing home canteen, alleged that no doctor had attended to the patient for almost two hours after they declined their advice to admit him to the ICU at Rs 10,000 a day. Jardish, 56, died in an ambulance while being taken to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. Officials at Swastik Nursing Home in Suri said Jardish's relatives had been informed that the patient's condition was serious and he needed to be admitted to the ICU. There was no demand for money, the officials said. The allegations come a day after the Mamata Banerjee government passed a bill empowering a regulatory commission to fix the charges for treatment at private hospitals in Bengal. The commission can also order cancellation of a private hospital's licence, closure of the establishment and confiscation of its property if it is found guilty of causing grievous injury or death. A mob had ransacked a private hospital in Calcutta last month after the death of a girl, accusing the authorities of negligence. The relatives of Jardish, a forest department employee who had been brought to Swastik with low blood pressure and high blood sugar, have lodged a police complaint. The nursing home has lodged a counter-complaint, accusing the family of manhandling staff and damaging property. Jardish's son Sheikh Sahidur Rahaman alleged that the doctor, Hari Om Dayal, had asked the family to admit the patient to the ICU but could not say how long he needed to be kept there when asked for an estimate of the expenses. ""I thought we would not be able to afford the cost of ICU and so decided to take my father to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. He was left untreated for two hours while we tried to hire an ambulance. Had he been given some treatment, he might have survived,"" Rahaman said. Rafiqul Islam, another relative, alleged that Swastik had charged Rs 2,500 for various tests but the doctor had not even looked at the reports. ""The nursing home was simply not interested after we declined their offer to admit the patient to the ICU. The doctor just put him on drip and left,"" Islam said. Susanta Das, the manager of the nursing home, said Jardish's family had been informed of the patient's condition. ""Repeated requests to admit him to the ICU fell on deaf ears. It was not for making money, but on the basis of an assessment of his condition,"" Das said. After Jardish's death in the ambulance, his family members found Dayal in the canteen. According to nursing home officials, they beat up Dayal and nurse Rejina Sultana, who tried to stop them. Repeated calls by this newspaper to the doctor's cellphone number went unanswered. The police are investigating both complaints."

However, department officials argue that procurement had been done in a completely transparent manner.Quoting information obtained under the RTI Act, 2005, from the department and public documents and agriculture-based websites quoting prices for various commodities in open markets and Agriculture Market Produce Committees, Mr. Gadad said at a press conference here recently that a total 2,10,468 quintals of highly substandard green gram was purchased from National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX) for a sum of about Rs. 12.653 crore in February and March this year. He alleged the department paid an average price of Rs. 6,012 per quintal, which was much higher than the average prices that range from Rs. 3,800 to Rs. 4,500 per quintal in open markets.Considering a minimum difference of Rs. 1,000 per quintal between vis--vis average procurement and market prices, the department has paid Rs. 21.04 crore over and above the market prices for green gram, Mr. Gadad alleged.Price of sugarSimilarly, it purchased 88,320 quintals of S-30 grade sugar at Rs. 400 per quintal kg and another stock of 16,900 quintals at Rs. 4,300 per quintal, even though the price of better quality of sugar was only Rs. 38 in markets. The price difference of Rs. 500 per quintal indicates that about Rs. 2.37 crore more was paid for the procurement of sugar.NCDEX e-tendersHowever, N.C. Gangadhar, Senior Deputy Director in the department at Bengaluru, categorically rejected the allegation stating that all procurements were made in a transparent manner through e-tenders from NCDEX, a professionally managed online multi-commodity exchange in Mumbai.Mr. Gangadhar told The Hindu that tenders for green gram and sugar were issued during November-December 2016 and commodities were purchased through e-tenders at e-prices from NCDEX as per the prices that prevailed on the day of purchase on condition of door-delivery. The procurement prices included the cost of door-delivery where sugar was supplied in a 50 kg bag and green gram in 1 kg plastic bags.He said the department was procuring commodities for PDS through the central e-marketing forum NCDEX with due permission from the government."

Famous for its wooden furniture, the mahogany is one of the most popular trees in the southern part of the island. Except that this one, which the MP is trying to save, has rare history. It was planted by Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara on a visit to then Ceylon in 1959, months after he and his comrades captured power in the Caribbean island nation.Guevara was on a study tour of Asia to learn about rubber cultivation and sugar trade. He visited Sri Lanka en route to India. W.A. Dingiri Mahattaya, the caretaker and cook at the estate bungalow in Horana, 50 km south of Colombo, recalled in a 2006 media interview the visit of a handsome, bearded, long-haired man in military fatigues and smoking a cigar. He knew it was someone important, but learnt about him only after his visit. Guevara had a Sri Lankan breakfast of egg hoppers, lunu sambol (spicy side dish) and bananas before he proceeded to plant the tree, Mr. Mahattaya recounted. Guevara walked around the estate and spoke to workers, through an interpreter, about their production method. Gifting the caretaker a box of cigars, he promised to come back but did not.The image of Guevara infatuated young Sri Lankan leftists in the decades that followed, not only because the nascent JVP was branded Che Guevarists by the state. Che was very vocal, his slogans like Create two, three, many Vietnams instantly resonated with us. [Fidel] Castro was not as prominent, recalls Lionel Bopage, former general secretary of the JVP, who resigned from the party in the 1980s after it took a Sinhala-chauvinist turn.Many like him, who as students were disillusioned by the old Left that had comfortably aligned itself with the bourgeois parties, drew inspiration from the Cuban revolution. This, despite a section of them being keen to come up with an indigenous model of revolution that was different from the Soviet, Chinese or Cuban variants.But I must say the romance of Che Guevara hit us all, Mr. Bopage says. Far from Guevaras ideology in its actual political practice, the early JVP adopted him as its icon in the 1970s. They reproduced his image on posters and energised their rallies with his slogans. In fact, the charismatic founder-leader of the JVP, Rohana Wijeweera, styled himself on the Cuban hero  sporting a similar beard and beret as him.Armed insurrectionsThe revolutionary lan of the JVP was viewed with great suspicion by an increasingly authoritarian state. The youth of the party led two armed insurrections in 1971 and 1987-89, both crushed by the state. Over the years, the JVPs politics shifted, as Sri Lankas ethnic conflict intensified in the 1980s. Sensing a strategic alliance between Indian expansionism, following the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987, and [Tamil] Eelamist separatism, the JVP unleashed another round of violence, only to be suppressed again by state violence.A guerrilla insurrection was needed in the past, but today we are in the democratic stream  we are in Parliament and in local government. We believe in challenging the bourgeois government through democratic resistance, says prominent JVP parliamentarian Vijitha Herath. But the memory of Guevara is very much alive within the party. Though we have changed our political tactics, we believe in Che Guevaras doctrine and teach our young cadre about it, he says.Far from Ches ideology in its actual political practice, the early JVP adopted him as its icon, reproducing his image on posters and energising its rallies with his slogans"

58f501e97be9e018510a1711,'Potato factory' keeps farmers in business,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170305/jsp/bengal/story_139079.jsp,2017-03-05,"Farmers cultivate process grade potato for PepsiCo in Anandapur village in Hooghly Anandapur (Arambagh), Mar. 4: Had Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi fought the farm-versus-factory debate over aloo (potato) in Anandapur village of Bengal, chances are that the Congress vice-president would have won by more than a wafer-thin margin. For the hundred-odd farmers working for US multinational PepsiCo, growing the right variety of potato is probably the most crucial step in a long process that culminates in factories churning out munchies. During an election rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh earlier this week, Prime Minister Modi had taken a dig at Rahul, who had in the past echoed farmers' demand to set up a potato factory for them. ""You are demanding a factory of aloo... but I am an Opposition leader. I can't take decisions. I can't put up an aloo factory,"" Rahul had said during his kisan yatra last year. Without naming Rahul, Modi said at a rally this week that potato grows in fields, not in a factory. ""You tell me whether aloo grows in the factory or field. You know but he does not know,"" the Prime Minister had said. But Rahul probably meant potato processing, which Pepsi is doing in Bengal. Bengal produces 112 lakh tonne of table grade potato compared with under 1 lakh tonne of process grade Growing the special process grade potato has saved at least 10,000 farmers this year from a price crash that the regular jyoti variety suffered because of a bumper crop. Compared to Rs 400 a sack (50kg each) for process potato that Pepsi is offering farmers at Anandapur in Hooghly, jyoti is selling at Rs 150 a sack from the field. That is because Pepsi had agreed on the price before the sowing season started in October. Last year, the jyoti variety had fetched a better price than the process variety. But Asim Choudhury, a farmer in Anandapur, stuck to the corporate because of his experience the year before. In 2015, he had decided to give Pepsi a break and gone back to growing the traditional variety. He lost Rs 18,000 a bigha. ""That taught me a lesson. I did not switch this year to jyoti even though there was a higher return in 2016. I have been proven right,"" Choudhury, who owns an acre, said. PepsiCo's chip factories need a potato with low sugar and high percentage of dry matter. The farmer is hoping to make a profit around Rs 18,000 a bigha on the crop he is harvesting now using a power tiller fitted with an attachment specially designed for potatoes. He has rented the machine, as he did in October last year to prepare the field and sow the seeds. The mechanical intervention, which almost turned the farm to factory, saved him at least Rs 2,500 a bigha. Chandicharan Mandal, a local handler or aggregator who has an agreement with Pepsi for cultivation of the process grade potato, had arranged the power tiller on rent with the company's help. According to Jaideep Bhatia, agri-director of Pepsi India, there are 117 such aggregators in Bengal who in turn work with farmers. Machines such as these can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. ""The state laws do not allow direct agreement with farmers like we do in Maharashtra. Even though a direct tie-up would have been more transparent, we are not complaining. We are working with the aggregators,"" Bhatia said. Mandal said he was looking after 150 acres in the area, about 90km from Calcutta. He gets the seeds from Pepsi, arranges pesticides and fertilisers, and then gets power tillers on rent as most small farmers cannot afford to buy them. ""Working for Pepsi has proved remunerative if somebody sticks to the company for 3-4 years. Now with the big power tillers, we are trying to move towards more mechanisation. It is almost like a factory,"" Mandal said, holding a pack of potato chips sold under the Lays brand by PepsiCo in India. His only grouse? ""We want more machines. Only a fraction of land can be harvested with this one. Please tell the company to get it next year. Everyone is asking for it,"" Mandal said, pointing to the tractor which can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. The correspondent's trip to Anandapur was sponsored by PepsiCo"

Trump will have a very hard time dealing with these divides because he does not understand them, said John Pitney, a professor of American politics at Claremont-McKenna College.On Mr. Trumps agenda are a major overhaul of the tax system and a bill to upgrade infrastructure like roads and bridges. We were very, very close to securing enough support for the bill, Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office. But with no Democratic backing, we couldnt quite get there.Mr. Trump had thrown his full political weight behind the measure, spending days arm-twisting recalcitrant Republicans, and he declared himself disappointed by the defeat. The battle was an eye-opening experience for Mr. Trump, a billionaire real estate tycoon who entered the White House with no experience in politics.The bills defeat marked a second major policy setback for the new President, who has seen his attempt to curb travel from Muslim-majority countries twice frozen by the courts.Instead of projecting humility, Mr. Trump went on the offensive on Friday, branding Democrats as the real losers of the failed repeal bid because now they own Obamacare. They own it, 100 per cent.The President met with House Speaker Paul Ryan earlier in the day, then spoke with him by telephone when it was clear the party did not have the votes to get its plan across the finish line.

""Let us see what he does. But Netaji is Netaji. He will remain a leader even if he (Akhilesh) doesn't return everything,"" she was quoted as saying to a section of the media in Etawah, Mulayam's home district, yesterday. The comments came two months after Akhilesh had taken over the reins of the Samajwadi Party, replacing his father as its chief at a party convention on January 1. ""Akhilesh ne kaha hai teen mahine mein sab kuchh lauta dega (Akhilesh has promised he would return everything in three months),"" Sadhana was quoted as saying. It was the first time Sadhana had made such a categorical statement since Akhilesh prevailed in the family feud that broke out into the open late last year. Sadhana did not specify what she meant by ""everything"" but it's possible she was referring to the post of party national chief. Earlier, in September, Mulayam had removed Akhilesh as Samajwadi state chief and handed the post to his younger brother, Shivpal Yadav. The chief minister, in retaliation, had sacked Shivpal from his cabinet. He took Shivpal back after a few days and later sacked him again. On January 1, Akhilesh replaced his father as Samajwadi national president after a show of hands. Sadhana said whatever happened on January 1 was unfortunate. ""We didn't sleep for many days and couldn't understand what was happening. Thereafter, we left things to God and time,"" she said, adding that from now on she wouldn't work from behind the curtain. ""I will come forward and work without any post or salary. I want Akhilesh to win and become chief minister again,"" she said. Asked about the future of her son, Prateek Yadav, she said: ""He will observe things and decide.... But we will never tolerate (any) insult to Netaji. He founded the party and took it to its present position."" Shivpal, she added, shouldn't have been insulted. ""He has done a lot for Netaji and the party.... He deserves a position in the party."" Sadhana had met Mulayam for the first time in 1989 and the Samajwadi patriarch had, in an affidavit in the Supreme Court in 2007, accepted she was his wife. That was four years after the death of Akhilesh's mother, Malti Devi. Some party insiders believe Sadhana has been trying to establish her son and daughter-in-law Aparna in politics. Aparna is the party's candidate from Lucknow Cantonment in this election. Sadhana kept returning to the ""insult"" Mulayam had faced. ""Netaji shouldn't have been insulted,"" she repeated, ""otherwise, everything was fine. But he shouldn't have been insulted. Nobody should have done this. He (Mulayam) had faced tremendous hardship in building the party."" Sadhana said she wanted everybody (in the family) to be together. ""I wanted all of us to sit together at festivals and talk. The incident of January 1 would not have happened had they done this."" She denied any role in the family feud and said she wanted everything to be all right between father and son. ""He (Akhilesh) may be misguided. He cares for his father and me. He often tells me to avoid having sugar,"" she said. ""We don't know what happened,"" she added. ""Everything was fine. He danced at Prateek's wedding and took Aparna's friend to see the Taj Mahal. I had never imagined that such things would happen."" Prateek and Aparna had got married in December 2011."

Officials of the special joint squad conducted an eviction drive at Bapuji Nagar last Friday and found shopkeepers encroaching upon pavements to display their wares. Tax collectors fined 15 shopkeepers and collect Rs 7,500 from them. ""We are conducting drives to free pavements and cycle tracks from encroachment. We have removed small-scale street vendors and had also fined mid-scale shopkeepers for encroaching upon public space.

The squad completed the eviction drive without the help of the police. Mayor Ananta Narayan Jena said the aim of the drives was to provide the space to pedestrians and cyclists for promotion of non-motorised transport.

""It's really impressive how the city administration is carrying out the eviction drives. Earlier, I remember, the squatters returned soon after the eviction drives.

Telegraph picture Gopalganj, March 9: Their feet are swollen and crocodiles lurk nearby, but dozens of people are standing in a stream of the Gandak river at a village in Gopalganj district for the past three weeks. The residents of Kalamatihaniya village in Kuchaikot block, around 195km northwest of Patna, are demanding anti-erosion measures to save the area's villages. Hundreds of fellow residents keep vigil on the banks while they stand in the water, hands folded. The residents are calling their struggle a ""Jal Samadhi Satyagraha"" and have united under the banner of Gandak Diara Sangharh Samiti, which is demanding the digging of a pilot channel and construction of an anti-erosion wall. On Thursday, organisation convener Anil Kumar Manjhi embarked on a fast-unto-death to press for the demands. More residents are likely to join the fast after Holi. ""This is a diara (riverine area). The main stream of the Gandak is 5km away. During last year's floods, a branch of the river broke and began flowing this way, eroding villages and settlements that have been around for 200-250 years,"" Anil said. The riverine area includes 70 villages with population of around 75,000, and around 10,000 acres of fertile land that grows the best sugarcane in Bihar. ""This stream has already eroded and swept away six villages, displacing 2,000 families,"" Anil said. ""The remaining villages may not survive the monsoon if a pilot channel is not dug to turn it back to the main stream. An anti-erosion wall will provide additional protection."" In just a little over two months, the water of the stream will start rising, rendering construction work impossible. ""We will not budge till our demands are met,"" said Sachin Snehi, a Samiti member. ""Construction work should start immediately, or it would be too late."" The state water resources department did sanction anti-erosion projects, including a 20m wide pilot channel for Rs 12 crore, in December 2016. The deadline is May 15; tenders are yet to be finalised. ""We are making all efforts to end the satyagraha and people's woes,"" said Gopalganj district magistrate Rahul Kumar. ""We are hoping that the bids for a 2km anti-erosion wall and a few anti-erosion works near Ahirauli dam are finalised within 24 hours and work also begins.""

His is one of the two Muslim families left in Phugana village of Budhana district in Uttar Pradesh after the riots in 2013. Photo: R.V. MoorthyR_V_Moorthy;R_V_Moorthy -Shakoor Ahmed, a blacksmith, sits on his haunches, covered in a thick blanket and hard at work, with one of his grandchildren hovering in the background. Today, his is one of the just two Muslim families left in Fugana. Other members of the community  once 4,000 strong here  fled this village in Budhana tehsil, one of the areas worst affected by the communal violence that devastated Muzaffarnagar district in 2013.A Jat family saved Shakoors family during the riots. So he stayed on. Why did the others leave? Terror, fear, he says, one wary eye on the group of Jats who loom over him as he talks. And then in a burst, he says, Its not easy, you know, to uproot yourself from the land of your ancestors and begin a new life in strange surroundings.But that is precisely what most of the roughly 45,000 Muslims had to do after fleeing their villages for the safety first of relief camps and then of new single-community settlements. Shakoor, I discover later, was allowed to stay on in Fugana as he performs an important function  repairing farming implements. If he was not there, his Jat neighbours would have had to trudge to the nearest town for their work. He is there on sufferance.If Shakoor, after some prodding, declares his allegiance to the Samajwadi Party, his Jat saviours are vocal about their continuing support for the BJP, pointing to its muscular approach to national security. But barely two kilometres away, another group of Jat farmers, who say they voted for the BJP in 2014, are now vociferous in their support for the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).Last time, there was a pro-BJP wave, thanks to the Hindu-Muslim divide that was created. We all got swept away, Bijendra Singh says. But now, notebandi [demonetisation] has hit us very hard. Not just that, the BJP government has done nothing for farmers  it hasnt increased sugar cane prices, diesel has become more expensive, our loans are not being waived. Farmers are in distress. We will vote for [RLD leader] Ajit Singh this time.What about the SP? The SP has done nothing for us either, he says firmly.So though there is a consensus  as one travels through western U.P.  that the Hindu-Muslim polarisation that helped the BJP sweep the State in 2014 has faded, the embers of the 2013 communal conflagration glow in some places.The tension between the two communities that were at the heart of that bloody conflict, Jats and Muslims, has not quite gone away, making it hard for each to vote for the candidates of the other, as they once did.This has made the SP and the Congress wary of allowing the RLD, a largely Jat party, to become part of a Bihar-style grand alliance, though the RLD will field Muslim candidates too.Lack of trustPramod Tyagi, SP candidate for Budhana, articulates this view. He says the continuing lack of trust between Jats and Muslims will ensure that the RLD will not be able to transfer its votes to the SP-Congress alliance around which his party hopes the Muslims will cluster.But there is a contrary view not just from the RLD but also from the Janata Dal(U) that has been promoting an extended anti-BJP alliance, though it has little at stake in UP. Senior JD(U) functionary K.C. Tyagi, who is from this area, says, Jats dont vote in isolation. They want to be on the winning side. If the RLD is not part of the alliance, Jats may be more inclined to vote for the BJP.Giving some perspective to the whole issue is a long-time political watcher and three-time Congress MLA from Muzaffarnagar, Somansh Prakash. The Jat-Muslim tension, he says, may be a factor in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts, but there are over 80 constituencies across 19 districts in which the Jat vote is influential: the impact of the 2013 communal violence does not exist there at all today. A SP-Congress-RLD alliance will definitely create a bigger impact, and even bring in a larger number of Jats, who will see this as a winning combination."

Clearly, we're of the view that a formalisation of the economy helps the formal players. I think it'll be good in the medium-term and the longterm,"" said Quincey, who is serving as Coke's chief operating officer and is often credited with steering the company toward drinks that contain less sugar.India is Coca-Cola's sixth largest market and is considered key to the company's growth at a time it is contending with shifting tastes in its traditional markets, such as the US and Europe. In India, too, the demand for healthier drinks is increasing faster in urban centres, with consumers switching to fruit-based drinks.Uneven rural incomes and the currency swap appear to have depressed growth in rural India as well, with volumes increasing in low single digits over the past four quarters. India's carbonated drinks sales are estimated at about Rs 14,000 crore. Coca-Cola did not specify India sales numbers for the October-December '16 quarter, but said global volume sales fell 1 per cent, while net revenues declined 6 per cent.It said full-year non-aerated beverage volumes increased 5 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region. Quincey said plans to boost growth include focusing on smaller-sized packages and no-calorie sparkling beverages.In the latest quarter, smallersized packages sold 10 per cent more, while no-calorie colas saw accelerated growth in the second half of the year.Coca-Cola's assessment of the impact of currency swap comes about four months after the Indian government withdrew bills of 500 and 1,000 rupee denominations overnight to help curb counterfeiting and expansion of a parallel economy that the state argues begins with cash as the primary store of value. The withdrawal of these bills hurt sales of goods and services across sectors in the October-December quarter in a country where 98 per cent of consumer transactions were done in cash.""Things we saw occur in the quarter and responded to included, for instance, India, where demonetisation impacted the whole CPG (consumer products and goods) landscape. Our system responded quickly by facilitating digital payments, extending credit to mitigate destocking, and increasing our emphasis on modern trade,"" said the CEO-designate.In 2016, the maker of Coke and Sprite fizzy drinks and Minute Maid juices, reported 3 per cent organic revenue growth. Headwinds facing Coca-Cola include shifting consumer tastes and governments plans to tax sugary drinks. ""I think what we need to see is some stabiliastion, and we will be able to then come back and execute our game plan. So I don't think that's particularly about resetting everything we do in India. I think it's about working through the effects of this one-off demonetisation,"" Quincey added.Coca-Cola chief financial officer and executive VP Kathy Waller told analysts and investors that some of the problems may take time to resolve. ""For example, in India, where we own the majority of our bottling system, the tough operating environment stemming from demonetisation is likely to persist at the start of the year before gradually recovering,"" she said."

Sources said Sambam, Kuddapalli, Gaoidi, Setammapeta and Dhonubai villages are almost dry now.Small lakes and village ponds are water sources in these areas for not only human beings but also animals.A herd of 11 pachyderms came to Srikakulam forests from Lakeri forest in Orissa in 2007. Only four of them are now living and damaging crops like banana and sugarcane, said S Kumar, a farmer of Setammapeta.These elephants have started entering villages for the water and food. Each elephant drinks 200 to 600 litres of water a day on an average. They have caused destruction in fields at Kotturu mandal in the past three months. They damaged maize crop in Madanapuram last Saturday. At present, they are moving along the Vamsadhara river in the mandal.Additional principal conservator of forests, Visakhapatnam , N Prateep Kumar told TOI that in summers the forest department provides water to the animals in the sanctuaries and forest areas. ""Luckily, there was no problem with the elephants last summer. In 2015, we were forced to tranquilize one of the two male elephants in Vizianagaram district. Apart from these, there are four female elephants settled in Srikakulam forests,"" he said.A male elephant died after being electrocuted and the other one panicked and wreaked havoc in the nearby villages. He was caught and brought to Visakha Zoo.The forest officer said his department had brought an expert from Himachal Pradesh and provided training to the tribals on how to drive away elephants if they come close to the villages. In this technique, chilly powder is stuffed into gunny bags with available local material. The smell of the chillies drives away elephants. Sufficient quantity of the chilly powder was procured by the forest department. Burning fire crackers and beating drums are not the correct procedure to drive away elephants. They get disturbed and turn violent at the sound of drums."

They further added that almost 97 per cent of farmers in the district come under small and marginal groups due to which aid from the government is inadequate.Apart from these factors, MNREGS is also hurting the farmers during the planting season, many of them whom used to grow lentils as dry crop during the summer season. A farmer from Salur mandal , GS Naidu said, ""I grew close to 60 tonne of sugarcane per acre in the last two years. However, today, despite the soil being rich in nutrients and adequate water, I'm not growing the crop because it has become extremely difficult to find labour due to MNREGS.""Sugarcane is planted in the months of February and March in north coastal AP and as a result of MNREGS, many farmers are opting out of it. In the drier zones closer to Vizag district, the culprit is chiefly the weather. Farmers are is dependent on rain water and last year's northeast monsoon left many farmers high and dry.A farmer from L Kota mandal P Surrappa Raju said, ""I have given up on agriculture and will simply take to orchards in the coming years as the whole process has become extremely taxing and unyielding. The labour problem is unmanageable and the government only seems to be creating more problems through the MNREGA by implementing it at a time when there is urgent need of farm hands."""

Another major cause of CKD is self-medication by patients, especially pain killers, which have a very telling effect on the kidneys.Speaking to TOI on the occasion of the World Kidney Day on Thursday, chairman of Nephrology Society of Nagpur Dr Prakash Khetan said that the theme of this year for the day is Kidney and Obesity. Almost 10% of the adult population in the country is obese. And when obesity and diabetes come together, it makes the body predisposed to CKD and kidney cancer.""It also leads to loss of protein in the urea. But paradoxically, obese people live longer on dialysis than thin persons,"" Dr Khetan said.Vice-chairman of the society, Dr Monali Sahu, said that since obesity results in insulin resistance, it increases the load on the kidneys. And to add to all the complexities, the sedentary life style coupled with food habits like high salt intake and fast food put the patient in the vicious circle from where he/she is unable to walk out.Tobacco and gutka are also big killers. They affect the small blood vessels in our body and since the kidneys have a network of small blood vessels, they are worst-affected.""Patients who have got high blood pressure but have got so used to it that they no longer feel the symptoms of hypertension are the worst-hit. These need individualized treatment and dose adjustments. Early detection can actually reverse CKD,"" said Dr Sahu.She said that self-medication, mainly buying and eating pain killers across the counter, causes CKD. But patients seldom realize this and compound the problem further.Dr Sameer Chaubey also strongly condemned the use of pain killers. ""Medicines containing 'bhasams' lead to deposition of various metals in the kidney and affect its functioning very badly. The incidence of CKD has risen by 8-10% in the last few years mainly due to increase in diabetes,"" he said.The need is to control sugar levels, blood pressure, to drink a lot of water or fluids, avoid smoking and drinking, reduce weight, change lifestyle, and stop eating fast food. Diabetic patients also get a disease called proteinurea in which the body secrets healthy protein in the urine which is very harmful for the body."

The consumer food price index slowed to 0.5% in January from previous month's 1.4%. In rural areas, food inflation was 1.1%, while in urban centres it fell 0.5% as prices of vegetables and food items softened.Vegetable prices fell an annual 15.6% in January, while price of pulses contracted 6.6%. Pressure continued to mount on the sugar and confectionary sector where prices rose 18.7%. Economists expect retail inflation to inch upwards in the months ahead.""A favourable base effect and sequentially softer prices of vegetables and pulses contributed to the decline in CPI inflation to 3.2% in January 2017, in line with our expectations.A reversal in the base effect and the seasonal rise in prices of perishables are expected to push up the next two readings of CPI inflation. We continue to expect March 2017 inflation to exceed 4.5%,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency Icra said.Experts said the non-food components have shown higher price increases. For example Pan, intoxicants: 6.4%, clothing and footwear: 4.7%, Housing 5.0%, Fuel and light: 3.4% ""Clearly the non-food components have registered an increase and would tend to be upward moving going ahead.Higher global commodity prices will get ingrained in these components, while food items will be unaffected,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings, said.Earlier this month, RBI had surprised markets by holding rates, citing emerging inflationary pressures.The monetary policy panel had projected inflation in the range of 4-4.5% in the first half of the financial year and in the range of 4.5-5% in the second half with risks evenly balanced around this projected path.""In this context, it is important to note three significant upside risks that impart some uncertainty to the baseline inflation path  the hardening profile of international crude prices; volatility in the exchange rate on account of global financial market developments, which could impart upside pressure to domestic inflation; and the fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC), which have not been factored in the baseline inflation path,"" RBI had said.""The focus of Union budget on growth revival without compromising on fiscal prudence should bode well for limiting upside risk for inflation,"" the monetary policy panel had said."

Now, post the 2017 polls, let other parties help MGP form the government and watch it deliver, he said. Dhavalikar also spoke about defence minister Manohar Parrikar 's inability to get a full five-year term in the CM's chair whenever he has got the post, the MGP's decision to not touch the medium-of-instruction issue during the 2017 polls and Parrikar firing from CM Laxmikant Parsekar 's shoulders. Excerpts:You will be surprised. We are doing very well. The groundswell of support is in our favour. It is good that we are not in alliance with BJP. They are trailing. We would have faced the same music from the people.They will not cross double digits.Yes, they poached the candidates. They think they can do so as they are in power (at the Centre). They might even poach our MLAs after the polls. They are showing signs of desperation to retain power.Yes, we'll decide that later. We have to think of the future of Goa in the long term. At this stage, I don't want to touch that issue. Supreme Court has also said so. Not to use it in the elections. After we form the government, we'll have threadbare discussion on the issue and decide accordingly.If anyone wants us, they should support us.It can't be (BJP will not be close to forming the government). They can join us.No, not at this stage.Why should we? All these years, except once, we supported BJP. This time, they should support us. Let them reciprocate. One observation. Parrikar doesn't have luck to give a stable government for five continous years. None of his terms have gone beyond two-and-half to three years. He first became CM in October 2000. When he realized that his government would fall, he dissolved the house in February 2002. Parrikar became CM again in June 2002, but lost power due to the split in the BJP in early 2005. BJP got a good mandate in 2012, but then he couldn't complete the full term due to circumstances as he was elevated to the Union cabinet.You tell me. When was there stability except the current term. As mentioned above, there was so much instability that Parrikar dissolved the assembly in 2002. In his second term too, it was an unstable government which ultimately collapsed under its own weight. We would have done wonders if we were to get such a mandate of 21 seats. BJP got 21 seats in 2012 and MGP got three and there were others. So despite the majority and stability, they couldn't deliver.There were many factors. There was strong resentment against them. The undercurrents were clear. There was arrogance. The approach of the leaders would change based on what their workers tell them. They go by what their karyakartas tell them. Except for me, the others in the party didn't get proper attention from them. It won't be wrong to say that it was like step-motherly treatment. Several projects were given to GSIDC, when PWD could have handled them well and that too at a lower cost. Even funds were not released in time.He couldn't run the administration. In his own admission, he has said that he took a long time to learn. He was being dictated from Delhi by the defence minister. Yes, Parrikar used to fire from his shoulders. We will definitely not join hands with BJP to form the government if Parsekar is to be the CM.MGP during its 17-year rule brought in virtually revolutionary measures to protect the common man. Land to the Tiller Act, Tenancy Act were given by Goa's first CM Bahusabheb Bandodkar. He promoted education in a big way. Brought in industrial growth - Birla's Zuari, MPT, shipyard, Ciba, Sanjeevani sugar factory and MRF, among others. We will strive to continue in the direction given by Bahusaheb and provide holistic development to the people of Goa."

The 200-odd families in Chauri village consider tyre tube and air pump essential commodity to keep them afloat. Chauri is among dozens of villages where life comes to standstill every year during monsoon.Located close to the forceful Sharda river, off the Palia-Nighasan state highway, lakhs of people are hit by floods every year. Cousin brothers Randheer and Balbir of Chauri have learned to tide over the strong currents that leave their village marooned . ""But we cannot think of surviving without tubes. It feels like spending four months on an island,"" said Randheer displaying the tyre tube outside his kutcha house.Like every election season, this time too netas have queued up in Lakhimpur villages promising to fix the problem by erecting concrete retaining walls. But villagers have stopped taking their promises seriously.During floods, district administration takes help of people who own boats and deploy them as per their discretion. ""Boats available with administration are few and we are forced to risk our lives and arrange for fodder for cattle and get groceries, oil and other sundry items from across the stream floating on the tube. Generally, we borrow stuff from relatives who stay on higher grounds and have access to the city,"" said Balbir.Thousands of residents of Chauri, Khalepurwa, Ballipur, Narosa, Laguan, Piparia, Ramnagar Kalan and Ghoom Pipara gram sabhas under Nighasan, Palia and Gola assembly constituencies have been forced to shift out of their original houses at least twice.Shri Krishna (42) from Ramnagar Kalan was forced to change three homes. ""I have become a voter of different constituency now. Earlier, I came under Palia. After the third instance in 2013, we decided to construct a pucca house far away from Sharda basin. Acres of agricultural land sank, unable to withstand the strong currents in July,"" said Krishna.Between Palia and Nighasan, the embankment raised to hold the river gets breached at several places. ""Excess mountain water is released in Sharda from Banbasa dam in Champawat district. As Uttaranchal government monitors the dam, we have little scope to do anything,"" said Sanjay Shukla, pradhan of the biggest gram panchayat Bhira in Lakhimpur Kheri district where 17,000 people live. Newly built pulias (small bridges) are the ones that wither away easily if monsoon is good, adds Shukla.A small breach leads to four months of flood-like situation in the adjoining village which lasts between July and October. Surjeet Singh, a sugarcane grower from Bhira has lost 9.5 acre of land in the past eight years. ""This year too, we had to employ JCB to clear the slush after flood water receded,"" said Surjeet, pointing at the sandbanks next to his fields which were green till 2013. Over the decades, villagers have learned to handle nature's fury, knowing there is little the elections would change."

The Central Board of Secondary Education has decided, in principle, to allow students appearing for Class X and XII board exams in March and April this year to take a break for a mid-exam snack.Type-1 diabetic patients, who depend on two to four insulin injections every day to keep their sugar levels balanced, are advised not to have too long a break between snacks. Else, the low sugar level will lead to them having a headache and suffering from irritability, restlessness and confusion.CBSE will soon notify that diabetic students will be allowed a snack break during exams, an hour or 90 minutes from the commencement of the test. It is also likely to advise school principals to start a similar practice in their institutions, as is done in the United States.""We are working out the details,"" announced RK Chaturvedi , chairman, CBSE, on Friday. ""We will probably issue a detailed circular on the matter in the coming week.""The relief to the diabetic students was considered by the education board after Dr Ashok Jhingan, chairperson of the Delhi Diabetes Research Centre , approached it to consider the problem. He buttressed his request with the results from a study in four Kendriya Vidyalayas that had allowed its students with Type-1 diabetes to have a mid exam snack.According to Jhingan, there are four lakh children with Type-1 diabetes in the country, around 14,000 of them in Delhi-NCR. ""These children need insulin half an hour before eating, which means between 6.30 am and 7.30 am,"" the doctor said. ""In schools, the students generally are allowed a light snack after two hours to prevent their sugar level falling. This is because the regular class breaks usually take place at 11 am, around three hours after school starts. Without the snack between 9am and 10am, their sugar level could drop, leaving them irritable and unable to concentrate on their studies.""Even students who otherwise do well academically through the year face problems at exam time, said Jhingan. They normally leave for the exam hall at least an hour before the scheduled time for the test. ""If the exam starts at 10 am,"" explained Jhingan, ""then it means the children have their insulin shots at around 8.30am. They start developing low sugar levels by 11 am. If the exam is of three hours' duration, it will go on till 1 pm. In such a situation, there is a decline in the performance levels of the diabetic students."""

But now, the situation has taken a turn for the worse with many doctors going through a num ber of emotions that are contributing to their stress. "" Anger and pain are common. Some sincere and dedicated doctors are having problems because they are being painted with the same brush as others. Some are getting defensive,"" she said.The perceived change in how the public views them -from saviours to being an inte gral part of an essentially commercial set-up, where service is secondary -has left many medicos with low morale. Some doctors have sought help since they have got disillusioned with the system. ""My husband too is adoctor and from him I often get to hear a lot of what many medicos are going through. Unlike in the West, doctors in India didn't have to deal with the fear of being sued. Today , they have to deal with patients and relatives who are threatening them.That's adding to their stress levels,"" Mukherjee said.According to psychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra, everyone needs a certain amount of stress to perform. ""This medium stress, which is called `EU stress', was helping doctors perform at their best. Now, the stress levels are so high that it has turned into distress. Under such circumstances, the performance of an individual goes down,"" said Mitra, who normally treats around five doctors every month.Now, he is anticipating the figure to go up. ""Among my existing doctor patients, I am seeing an increased level of stress and anxiety related to the recent turn of events,"" he said. Generally , the physical symptoms of stress in clude body aches, irritable bowel, lack of sleep, flaring up of skin disease and high blood sugar and blood pressure levels.The emotional symptoms include anger, irritability , palpitation, breathlessness, anxiety , depression and worsening of relationships. With increasing stress, there is possibility of a patient getting depressed and paranoid and some might even get addicted to alcohol.What has worsened the situation for doctors is blatant blackmail. ""Relatives of patients who died five years ago are calling up demanding compen sation. At least 10 doctors I know have been threatened by patient parties who have threatened to file a complaint unless they receive monetary compensation. I had a patient telling me he would shoot off letters to all because he had to wait for a long time before he could be treated,"" said psychiatrist Jairanjan Ram.Recently , an Islampur-based took to social media to describe how he was allegedly beaten. After the incident, he complained of insomnia and a dip in morale.""I have seen that post. It reveals the kind of trauma doctors are now going through. In this case, this doctor may exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in future,"" psychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra said."

Later, when the tests were conducted, he was found suffering from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is one of the major causes of stroke.With obesity, the cases of OSA are constantly being reported in the city. Over the past few years, private hospitals in the city have introduced the polysomnography (PSG) test, which requires a night stay at a hospital. In the test, a machine monitors breathing, heart rate and brain waves. Now, in city also, the test can be done in the comfort of your bedroom.""Obstructive sleep apnea is a silent killer. People think that snoring is ordinary and ignore it. They take it in lighter mode. But, in reality, it is life-threatening too,"" Dr Virendra Singh, former superintendent of Sawai Man Singh Hospital and respiratory diseases expert said.Dr Singh said, in sleep apnea, oxygen supply to the brain is interrupted, which causes other health related problems, including blood pressure and other heart-related problems.OSA leads to disturbed sleep which can have a detrimental effect on the overall health and well-being. Health experts claimed that there is a strong relation between sleep apnea, obesity and diabetes & blood pressure issues (metabolic syndrome) which can cause serious health complications. Studies suggest that they are intertwined in a way that each can cause the other and the occurrence of one can significantly worsen the other.Dr Deepak Yaduvanshi chief consultant pulmonologist (Asthma & Allergy & ICU specialist at a private hosptial, said, ""When a person experiences regular episodes of obstruction of upper airway during sleep, then he/she is said to be suffering from OSA. The syndrome is associated with snoring, disturbed sleep and feeling sleepy during the day.""Dr Yaduvanshi, who is also head of sleep lab in a private hospital said that there are treatment available for OSA which include life style modification, using a CPAP machine which prevents the collapse of the airway when a person breathes in by increasing air pressure in the throat, palatoglossus surgery and one is melatonin spray.He said that the people talk about personal hygiene but now there is a need to encourage sleep hygiene, which include complete eight hours sleep, going to bed early, cleaning the bed, keeping away from electronic gadgets so that sleep should not be interrupted.According to a study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR), prevalence of metabolic syndrome in OSA patients was as high as 79% compared to 48% in non-OSA patients.Dr S K Sharma, a diabetologist said, ""In sleep apnea, a patient's oxygen level falls during sleep and there is a sympathetic surge which leads to micro arousal of the brain. The arousal causes a disturbance in the sleep- deep sleep to light sleep. The surge results in a rise in the blood sugar level, thus, increasing susceptibility to diabetes and other risk factors. This is one of the causes for the link between OSA and metabolic syndrome.""According to World Health Organisation Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a clinical disorder marked by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep usually accompanied by loud snoring.These pauses cut off the oxygen supply to your body for a few seconds and halt the removal of carbon dioxideAs a result of this, your brain briefly wakes you up, re-opens the airways and re-starts breathingThis can occur many times during the night and makes proper sleep impossibleDuring the day you may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty in concentrating or headaches. At night, snoring is the most common feature"

Considering that sugarcane is a highly water-intensive crop and the area under cultivation is coming down, special efforts will be made to increase the area under drip irrigation to enhance productivity. ""The state has set a target of extending drip irrigation to 35,000 acres of sugarcane fields and bringing 40,000 acres under sustainable sugarcane initiative method of cultivation,"" the minister said. The agriculture department promotes cultivation of pulses wherever sufficient groundwater is available,by adopting various technologies including water conservation techniques.About 57% of the area under cultivation in the state is rain-fed. Considering its vulnerability to vagaries of weather, a mission on sustainable dry land agriculture has been launched, providing subsidized seeds and ploughing subsidy for taking up cultivation of crops sustainable for dry lands such as millets, pulses, oil seeds and cotton.While the scheme is implemented in 200 dry land clusters of 2,500 acres each, another 400 clusters will be taken up next year, covering 10 lakh acres of dry land.To help small and marginal farmers, Jayakumar said the state would launch ""farmer producer organizations"" to promote collective farming for credit mobilization, better adoption of technology and to facilitate effective forward and backward linkages. Next fiscal, 2,000 farmer producer groups will be promoted, each comprising not less than 100 farmers.""Each farmer producer group will be given a corpus fund of Rs 5 lakh, besides channelizing grants and credit available to farmer producer organizations from NABARD and Small Farmer Agri Business Consortium,"" he said.

The surprise decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has hurt several sectors and dented demand.The industrial output data has remained volatile and economists have often called for a revision of the data to better reflect the reality and minimise the sharp volatility.According to the data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), industrial output grew an annual 5.7% in November compared to a decline of 3.4% in the year earlier period. The sector had declined 1.8% in October. Growth in November was helped by the favourable base effect and the performance of manufacturing, capital goods and consumer durables sectors. Between April and November, industrial output growth rose 0.4% compared to 3.8% expansion in the year ago period, reflecting the sluggishness still persisting in the sector.Economists said it was too early to predict whether the November data had shrugged off the impact of demonetisation. ""The positive IIP numbers have come as a surprise. Prima facie, it looks like the effect of demonetisation has been nullified by the huge negative base effect. However, this growth needs to be seen with caution, whether it is sustained in the coming months needs to be seen,"" Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at Care Ratings said.The manufacturing sector rose 5.5% in November compared to a decline of 4.6% in November 2015 while mining rose an annual 3.9% compared to 1.7% in the year earlier period. The capital goods sector, which is seen as a key gauge of industrial activity, rose 15% in November compared to a decline of 24.4% in November 2015. The consumer durables sector rose 9.8% compared to a growth of 12.2%. The electricity sector grew 8.9% in November compared to 0.7% expansion in November 2015.Separate data released by the CSO showed retail inflation slowed to a 25-month low of 3.4% in December. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index was 3.6% in November. Food inflation slowed to 1.4% in December compared to 2% in the previous month, largely on the back of a 14.6% decline in vegetable prices and 1.6% contraction in prices of pulses. Sugar and confectionary remained a pressure point rising an annual 21% in December."

Mr. Modi had reportedly condemned the Congress government for not removing him from the Ministry.With due respect to our Prime Minister, I would only like to submit that Mr. Modi is being misled by State BJP president B.S.

If it is proved that there was more than Rs. 3.25 lakh in cash at any of the offices of the three sugar factories and other business establishments and at my residences, I will resign.He said he could understand if Mr. Yeddyrappa, who is keen to become Chief Minister again, was lying to serve his political interests.

What else do I tell you about the impact of notebandi, says Kamta Prasad Verma (41), a small farmer in Padmai village of Bandas Naraini block.The Dalit, a Jatav, is furious with the Centre over demonetisation but is equally annoyed with the SP government for its neglect of the poor, especially during and after droughts. I am waiting to get my ration card for the last two years. Even the grains and items like oil and sugar [provided free by the Akhilesh government] are not supplied as promised. The administration eats up half, he says.Verma says he is voting for the BSP.

They are voting for the SP-Congress alliance, which has fielded Bharat Lal Diwakar, a Dhobi, who stood second here in 2012 on the cycle symbol but is fighting as a Congress candidate this time.Akhilesh provided us free ration for four months to help us weather the drought last year  oil, sugar, etc. We know no party can fully compensate us for our losses. At least he wiped our tears, says Subash Kahar, an OBC labourer.Nestled in the heart of Bundelkhands Banda district, one of the seven in this impoverished region, Naraini was won by the BSP last time by 5,000 votes.While a tour of the constituency showed that the incumbent MLA Dinkar was still popular, based on his clean image, the BJP is hoping for a turnaround based on its attempt to consolidate non-Yadav backward voters, who are in preponderance in this region, the upper castes and division of Dalits. The SP-Congress alliance on the other hand is banking on the outreach of Mr. Akhilesh in Bundelkhand."

Photo: R. RavindranThe neighbourhood tea shops appear to be learning a lesson or two from the success of upscale coffee chains in the city. In the last six months, as many as three start-ups selling premium varieties of tea have begun dotting Chennais landscape.The startups  Chai King, Tea2go and Chai Kings  are offering high quality tea at affordable prices. Sensing huge opportunity, the trio are also on an expansion mode. Ball park estimates indicate that in Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), the IT corridor of Chennai, on an average 4 lakh cups of tea is sold per day, of which 60 per cent sales happen in the evening and midnight.Currently, the market is unorganised and there is tremendous potential, said Suresh Radhakrishnan, founder of Chai King which commenced operations in August 2016. We prepare freshly brewed authentic tea sourced from Nilgiris and door deliver to corporates. We operate on a QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) model and we are the first mover in this space in Chennai. We also take advice from tea tasters and experts, he said. Chai King sells 700-900 cups per day from its outlet in Virugambakkam. The venture started off with a self funded capital of Rs. 8 lakh and its second outlet will be operational soon.After studying the Chennai market for more than eight months, Jahabar Sadique, co-founder of Chai Kings forayed into this space in October 2016. He said, When we did a preliminary analysis we found that if an outlet sold 1,200 cups of hot beverages 1,000 cups are only tea. We wanted the city to have hygienic tea at the same time at affordable price, Sadique said. According to him, Chai Kings uses sulphur free sugar, no emission electric bikes for delivery and six-stage filtered water used for chai preparation. The start-up which was started with initial investment of Rs. 85 lakh sells 800-1,000 cups of tea per day and is also looking to scale up to four more outlets from its existing three.The latest entrant in this space is Tea2go, a mobile tea vendor business started in January. Not many like to have tea from a vendor selling tea on cycles as they are skeptical about hygiene. We prepare tea at a centralised location and give it to vendors who work for us. Our cycle is designed in a way where even the cups have separate cabins to rest and are not exposed to dust. Our vendors wear a hair cap while at work, said its founder Sivaraj Muthuraman. Tea2go has 10 cycles each selling 250-300 cups of tea per day at various locations.Night shift marketNow the focus is on the night shift market, which is huge. The OMR belt will be our focus, said Sivaraj who has pumped in Rs. 3 lakh into this venture. According to analysts who track the hot beverages market in Chennai, the Ambattur belt sells more than 4 lakh cups of tea per day, T. Nagar sells more than 5 lakh cups of tea per day. Employees working in the IT sector and construction workers are the major consumers. One of the employees at a tea shop neighbouring the Olympia Techno Park, Guindy, said, We sell around 4,000 cups of tea per day.Estimates indicate that in OMR alone,an average of four lakh cups of teais sold per day"

Work is in progress in the rest of the ponds, tanks and check dams, R.Kandasamy, general manager of Bannari Sugars Limited, and the Foundation secretary.The size of the water bodies where desilting was carried out using earthmovers and bulldozers range from one to 10 acres.At places where rain was not substantial, the desilting could scale up water percolation, he said, attributing the positive outcome to a synergy amongst the Foundation, the farming community, and the district administration. Farmers, he said, played a pivotal role in clearing the water bodies and surroundings of prosopis juliflora overgrowth.While the Foundation contributed Rs. 2 crore, the value of man days and contributions by the farming community altogether would measure up to the worth Rs. 1 crore.Since 2000, the Foundation had constructed 30 check dams, alongside building toilets for the economically underprivileged and providing free training in tailoring for hundreds of poor women."

They pruned the saplings that were planted in November 2016, applied manure, removed weeds and straightened the tree guards as part of The Hindus  Friends of Chennai initiative.S. R. Prasanna, one of the organisers of Ainthinai, said mulch in the form of tender coconut shells and waste generated from crushing sugarcane were laid at the base of the saplings. Since it would be difficult to water the plants daily during the summer, this mulching would help retain moisture. It also helps in the growth of earthworms that are good for the soil, he explained.The volunteers usually carry out tree sapling maintenance every weekend from January to June, while planting saplings during the rest of the year.On Saturday, The Hindus Friends of Chennai, along with Madras Amigos Round Table 260, planted saplings at the JaiGopal Garodia Girls School in Virugambakkam.Bring Back Green is an initiative of The Hindus Friends of Chennai, focusing on conservation, restoration and transformation. Every week, restoration or plantation activities are planned within the city through Friends of Chennai volunteers. Details are available atwww.friendsofchennai.com.

They even get polling stations during the election time.All those rosy things turn tough for them when the river is flooded and the island gets marooned.They had to wade through the swift current of the flooded river to access medical facilities in times of emergency.They had to endure other untold miseries during monsoon times.After persistent demands, they finally got a new bridge linking them to Azhagiyamanavalam on the left bank.Now, the islanders feel that a road connectivity to the right bank abutting the Papanasam taluk in Thanjavur district would serve to improve their fortunes.We take our agriculture produce mostly to the Kumbakonam market which is one of the biggest shandies in the State. Since we do continuous farming all through the year, the big market is our only plausible source of sale. Also, our children got to colleges in Kumbakonam and Thanjavur. Besides which all our social activities are happening in Papanasam area and to access that we have readied our own makeshift road across the Coleroon. We would be happy if the State Government constructs a bridge linking our island to the left bank of the river,' says G. Subramanian, former Panchayat Union Councillor who was part of the team that struggled to get the bridge to the left bank.A new bridge to the right bank will reduce the distance between Thanjavur and Ariyalur. Pilgrims who visit the famous Shrine Basilica at Velankanni in Nagapattinam district or the Poondi Madha Basilica in Thanjavur district could easily reach the equally famous Our Lady of Refuge (Adaikalamadha) shrine at Elakurichi in Ariyalur district. Also, if a new bridge is constructed linking Kabisthalam area to the island, then a good connectivity from the eastern districts such as Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur to northern and western regions of the State with a reduced distance and travel time could effectively be in place, points out social activist Shanmugam of Papanasam.When contacted, PWD sources said that after thorough investigation, a proposal to construct a new bridge to link the island with Kudikadu in Thanjavur district on the right bank at an estimated cost of Rs. 58 crore has been forwarded to the State Government for sanction.The NABARD had already expressed its willingness to fund the project.The sources pointed out that the GO issued for the construction of the new bridge to link Azhagiyamanavalam and the Ramanallur island had itself spoken about the utility and the need for a bridge to the right bank and it must be a matter of time before the project becomes a reality."

Noted physician Dr. Arvind Gupta selected about 50 participants in Jaipur to test the efficacy of a new lifestyle accompanied by the intake of fenugreek.Within eight months, Dr. Gupta, a member of the research committee of the Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India, found encouraging results. The participants, who were not on any medication, reported an improved quality of life.Besides Jaipur, the study was carried out in New Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Puducherry and Thiruvananthapuram. In all these places, volunteers, aged 30 years or above, performed regular yoga and consumed the prescribed quantity of fenugreek seeds twice a day.Dr. Gupta told The Hindu that the study would help reveal the properties of fenugreek seeds that could prevent diabetes mellitus type-2, a long-term metabolic disorder.Fenugreek seeds are high in soluble fibre, which helps reduce blood sugar by slowing down digestion and absorption of carbohydrates.The study will also look into claims that yoga can effectively reverse the mechanism that causes diabetes. Dr. Gupta said regular yoga practice by the participants was keeping their weight as well as blood pressure under check.Undiagnosed, untreatedIn his earlier studies, Dr. Gupta  at present, the director at Jaipur Diabetes Research Centre  found that more than a quarter of patients with diabetes in the urban India remained undiagnosed and the status of control among them was low.As the cities move away from economic and social deprivation, there is [a] greater prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Behavioural risk factors such as smoking, smokeless tobacco use, low fruits and vegetables intake and high visible fat intake indicate that our urban populations are facing a chronic disease transition, he said.Dr. Gupta is a recipient of several prestigious awards and has edited the Journal of Association of Physicians of India in the past. He has received fellowships from the Indian College of Physicians and the Madras Science Foundation."

The distress of farmers is real and deserves attention. But appeasing farmers may not solve the several fundamental problems that ail the state's agriculture  problems which require major structural reforms and not just band-aid solutions.While the shortage of water owing to a lack of large perennial rivers is a major problem in the state, another deficiency is the fragmentation of land holdings. The average area of landholding in TN is around two acres, which in turn is insufficient for profit-oriented agriculture. Farmers abandon such lands, leaving them fallow or sell them at distress prices.Villages today suffer from unremunerative agriculture also due to the shortage of young male labour. Mathew Morell, director general of International Rice Research Institute, Manila recently said agriculture in India was mostly manned by people aged above 50. Most of them are not literate in remunerative farming practices.TN's agricultural growth rate has declined considerably since the green revolution (mid 1960s). The average annual rate of growth of foodgrain in TN has been just 1.67% compared to 11.13% of Punjab and the all India average of 4.4%.Benefits like waiver of farm loans, reduction in crop loan interest, increase in food, power subsidies and subsidy on agri-machinery dished out by state governments have also not helped in improving the situation. In 2006-2007, the state announced the waiver of cooperative bank farm loans to the tune of `6866 crore. When the cooperative banks levied 7% interest on farm loans in 2007-2008, the state government over a span of four years helped reduce the interest rate from 5% to 0% on prompt repayments. Market support price was also progressively increased for sugarcane through state advised prices. Despite the measure, TN slipped as a large producer of sugarcane in recent years. The sugar production of the state which was 25L tonnes five years ago dropped to 11L tonnes this year.The state has also been extending support for crop insurance and subsidies on agri machineries and drip irrigation. Yet, farming continues to be in distress and the contribution of agriculture has been steadily declining, and at present accounts for 8% of the state's GDP (against 14% for the nation).There is thus the need for a major reform in the agriculture sector. Chief among these is to agglomerate small land holdings without alienating ownership and violating land ceiling laws. This will allow farmers to use technology and farm mechanization for better productivity. States like Punjab and Rajasthan have already implemented this.Organisations like the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) offer a wide range of information and support services that help in mapping land for soil conditions and water.

She arrives at the jetty to oversee the unloading of the catch and stays on to supervise sales to customers from all over the city until sunset. Finally , the fish left over is hauled onto trucks bound for Crawford Market from where it's shipped out by seafood exporters. Now for the economics. Her family owns seven trawlers that bring in crates of shrimp, pomfret and Bombay Duck. Each makes two to three trips a month, with a haul worth about Rs 3 lakh every time, going by industry estimates.Welcome to the koliwada in Versova. Situated on a palm-fringed edge of the western coast, it belies conventional ideas of a coastal hamlet dependent on a traditional activity for its livelihood. The industry of fishing has transformed this once semi -rural settlement of kolis, considered a Backward Community, into an affluent quarter of packed, multi-storey buildings lining narrow streets. Business is booming in Versova koliwada. With over 300 trawlers, the approximately 4,000 households here record an annual turnover of approximately Rs 400 crore, says Rajhans Tapke, general secretary, Koli Mahasangh. ""The fishing business we see today is thanks to the co-operative movement. In fact, former chief minister Sharad Pawar always cited us as an example for the sugar industry to emulate,"" said Tapke. The village was the first in the city to boast of a cold storage and its own ice factory .The Tapkes themselves operate a couple of trawlers.A clan of three brothers, they own houses spread out over a couple of multi-storey structures in the village.Currently , there are four co-operative societies in the village, but the Vesava Machchimar Vividhkaryakari Sahakari Society Ltd is the largest with 4,000 members and 271 trawler owners affiliated as members.""Till 15 years ago, the society was responsible for the sale of fish. But now every individual trawler owner strikes his own deals. The society provides the diesel needed for the vessels and ice to store the fish. Most importantly, it regulates the floor price below which no one is allowed to sell. This is to ensure that there is no unhealthy competition,"" said Jitendra Chinchay , a director of the society .The affluence shows in the changed skyline of the koliwada. It is home to several three and four storey-buildings packed so close to one another that one can reach into adjoining structures through windows. The lavish use of marble and granite and the gadgets on display in homes tell how lucrative the business is.Rajendra Kale, chairman of the Vesava Society , said Versova has 3,000 active fishermen and employs about 5,000 people in ancillary activities. While the business of fishing is mostly a male domain, nearly 80% of those who hawk it are women. They handle wholesaleretail trade as well as negotiate long term deals with exporters.""On an average 25-30 trawlers return to the village with fresh catch daily. A trawler returns with fish worth nearly Rs 3 lakh,"" said Kale. Each trawler makes about three trips every month, spending a week out at sea.Tapke, however, says trawlers are forced to foray further out every time in search of fish and laments government's indifference to the trade. ""The sea is treated like a dumping ground. There is no proper treatment of sewage before it is released in the sea. The waters around Versova are so dark we stopped fishing here nearly over 25 years ago,"" he said.Versova creek is the largest of the inlets along Mumbai's coast. Several streams from Malad, Goregaon, Kowte, Erangal, Amboli and Oshiwara empty into it and, in turn, it opens into the sea at Juhu. Efforts to divert sewage and effluents away from the natural channels are limited or still in progress. The large volumes of waste flowing through the drains in the western suburbs eventually make their way into the Versova creek.""Even the Mithi river seems cleaner,"" said Tapke. Most of the flotsam gets washed up on the shore eventually . The boats now travel almost 50 nautical miles into the sea, said Pradeep Tapke , who owns two of them. The fishermen venture as far as Jaffrabad in the Kathiawar peninsula and Ganpatipule in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district.Along with growth in fishing activity , village elders have taken the lead in backward integration to minimize waste and improve profitability. Fish waste is converted into manure after it's dried on the beach or used as chicken feed by poultry farms. ""The tiny fish which have no market are sold to the food processing industry through suppliers,"" said Raj hans Tapke.Among other sources of revenue are a three-day Versova Fish Festival which Tapke has been organizing since 2005. This year, the village set up 60 stalls and each earned around Rs 5-6 lakh.The total business in those three days amounted to nearly Rs 4 crore.Recently , residents of highrises in the vicinity took the lead to rid the beach of plastic waste. Now that the stretch looks cleaner, Tapke senses an opportunity . He hopes to use a part of the beach to put up stalls on a permanent basis, provided the authorities are willing."

The wishes of the sector remained unfulfilled with no support schemes and allocations following the impact of demonetisation, they said.MSMEs expected more schemes in the budget but there is no allocation for industrial infrastructure development. Moreover, there is no relief in interest rate for MSME loans while NPA (non-performing asset) norms for MSME have not been relaxed, Mr. Vasu and Mr. Jain said in a statement. But they expressed happiness with the increase in allocation to the sector  from Rs. 5,463 crore in 2016-17 to Rs. 6,482 crore in 2017-18.The association welcomed certain measures announced in the budget. The statement said the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana had contributed significantly to funding the unfunded and the underfunded. Last year, the target of 1.22 crore was exceeded. For 2017-18, it has been proposed in the budget to double the lending target to 2.44 crore, with priority to Dalits, tribals, backward classes, minorities, and women. It also welcomed the announcement on the development of 600 Skill Development Centres under the Skill India Project, besides the 5% reduction in tax for the MSME sector.Hopes dashedMeanwhile, farmers in Mysuru are disappointed with the budget.Farmers have been facing a lot of difficulties because of the drought and demonetisation. We had [hoped for] special announcements. But all our hopes were dashed and todays budget has nothing much to feel elated about, said Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association.He said the budget should have announced some short-term measures to lift the morale of farmers who have been hit by successive droughts. We were looking for some immediate action. Over 50,000 farmers have died in the last year. This was a time they were looking earnestly towards the Centre for some benefits, he said.Mr. Shanthakumar added that the budget could have included loans of up to Rs. 3 lakh to farmers at zero per cent interest, since the government was now cash-rich, thanks to demonetisation.He, however, welcomed the decision to develop lakes for rejuvenating groundwater.Farmers have been facing a lot of difficulties.

Hardly five minutes later came the sound of a vehicle. While the teams took cover wondering how it reached so fast, an old motorcycle sputtered into their view.""A couple were sitting on it,"" says Vijay Kumar, ""involved in what seemed to be a heated argument.""One of the teams, building a bunker with sandbags, had to abandon the job. A tech team, seated in a sugarcane lorry (codenamed sweet box) parked in the middle of the road, had to switch off their gadgets so the couple wouldn't see their glow.""The last thing we needed was the couple to be still there when the ambulance tur ned up.Thankfully , they gradually faded from sight,"" says the book. As soon as the motorbike moved away , the teams got back to work, one building the bunker, the other re connecting gadgets, and within three minutes they were in position, their guns aiming the designated parking space for cocoon.STF driver Saravanan was behind the wheel, and Vel laidurai, an officer brought from Chennai, was acting as the messenger of a certain Mr X, ""a prosperous man with a reputation of being an upstanding citi zen"" who Veerappan trusted.Reaching the spot, Sara vanan slammed the brakes of the van which bore the name SKS Hospital, Salem (in the haste of repainting the STF van into the ambulance, someone had misspelled the word `Salem' as `Selam' on one side of the vehicle). He switched on lights in the rear cabin where Veerap pan and his three associates were sitting and ran out with Vellaidurai who had by then unpinned a stun grenade kept in a secret chamber under his seat in the van. In four seconds, the grenade went off, and Senthamaraikannan asked, through a megaphone, the gang to surrender.Vijay Kumar says the announcement was greeted by a round of AK-47 fire from the van.""Brass hosed down on Cocoon from every direction,"" says the author. The STF teams emptied 338 bullet shells in 20 minutes.Veerappan took three of them, one through his left eye. His aides Govindan, Sethumani and Chandra Gowda also fell to bullets.After STF men pulled wounded gang members out of the van, the officer says, he hobbled over, ignoring a cramped muscle. ""It was my only face-to-face moment with Veerappan, if it could be described as such. He was unable to speak and clearly dying.""Sometime in June 2001, K Vijay Kumar, then IG (operations) of BSF, was in a meeting in North Block after an ambush that killed 15 BSF jawans when a junior officer came with the message that there was an urgent call for him.Stepping out, he took the call. It was Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa.She said she wanted him to head the Tamil Nadu STF since the sandalwood smuggler problem had gone too far.Throughout her stint in the opposition, Kumar notes, Jayalalithaa had charged the DMK government with being soft on the brigand. Kumar said it would be an honour.Three years and four months later, on October 18, close to midnight after gunning down Veerappan, Kumar's first call was to Jayalalithaa. ""The CM has retired for the night. Is it urgent?"" Kumar recalls CM's secretary Sheela Balakrishnan telling him.He replied: ""I think she will like what I have to say.""

The patient was discharged within four days.Unlike those suffering from diabetes, the patient was diagnosed with high levels of insulin in the body, resulting in hypoglycemia or low sugar levels, which can trigger confusion, anxiety, personality disorders, aggressiveness, sweating, palpitations, feelings of hunger, dizziness and drowsiness and even seizures.""The robot, which was procured by the hospital in 2013, has two components  a console and a robotic arm.

The Mauritius government has recognised several Indian languages and is doing its part to encourage the same. We, the Telugu diaspora, not only speak and learn Telugu but also celebrate in traditional manner all the major festivals, some of them even declared as official holidays.Mr. Appadoo said the curriculum designed for students learning Telugu would have lessons from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and other scriptures.

File photo: K.K. MustafahK_K_MustafahScientists have found the reasons for an unexplained illness that affects children aged 15 years and younger in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, during the summer.A team of researchers from the U.S. and India have found that consumption of the litchi fruit, along with skipping evening meals, can result in very low blood glucose levels (less than 70 mg/dL) and acute encephalopathy, where brain functioning suffers.Those affected can have seizures and coma, and die in many cases. The results of the study were published in the journal Lancet Global Health . Children in Muzaffarpur frequently spend the day eating litchis, which is a summer fruit, and some skipped meals in the evening. Skipping an evening meal by itself results in low blood sugar levels during the night. This is particularly so in the case of young children as they have limited hepatic glycogen reserves.Hypoglycin A and methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), which are naturally present in litchi fruit, make the condition worse.Glucose levelsThe toxins block enzymes involved in normal glucose metabolism, and this results in an inability to synthesis glucose leading to acutely low levels of blood sugar. The build-up of other metabolic by-products could also have an adverse effect (encephalopathy) on children, the study found. The study details the effect of skipping the evening meal on the impact of these toxins.In 2013, scientists from Delhis National Centre for Disease Control, India (NCDC) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) started an investigation.The first focus of the team was to evaluate if the mysterious condition was due to an infectious cause.Most of the children did not have fever. And on testing the spinal fluid we did not find elevated white blood cell count. These two indicated that it was less likely to be to an infectious cause. It gave us a clue that we should look at non-infectious causes, recalls Dr. Padmini Srikantiah, Global Disease Detection Program  India, CDC, Atlanta and the corresponding author of the paper.With infectious causes ruled out and most sick children presenting with low blood glucose levels the team started investigating the role of toxins  exposure to pesticide, insecticide and heavy metals to name a few.In late 2013, CDC colleagues in Atlanta brought to our attention the well reported case of toxic hypoglycaemic syndrome in West Indies caused by hypoglycin A, a toxin found in ackee fruit, which is in the same family as litchi, she says. MCPG, which is a homologue had been detected in the seed of litchis, and was reported to cause low blood glucose in rats. So we started with a hypothesis.The 2014 outbreak allowed the scientists to investigate the role of pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals, besides hypoglycin A and MCPG in litchi fruits.We heard over and over again from parents that their children were healthy and running around the day before, but presented with seizures and loss of consciousness in the early morning. Some people also said their children had skipped the evening meal the previous day, says Dr. Srikantiah.A study of children who were sick showed that over 62% had blood glucose level less than 70 mg/dL (amount of glucose per decilitre of blood). The median was 48 mg/dL and it was as low as 8 mg/dL.Researchers compared 104 children with illness with others without illness. They found metabolites of hypoglycin A and MCPG in 66% (48 of 73 cases) of urine samples but none from the 15 controls. About 90% of children with illness showed severe disruption of fatty acid metabolism. In 36 litchi samples tested, hypoglycin A ranged from 12.4-152 microgram per gram and MCPG ranged from 45-220 microgram per gram. The level of hypoglycin A and MCPG was twice in unripe compared with ripe fruits.Dextrose therapyAfter our field investigation in July 2013, we didnt know the cause but we recommended dextrose therapy to children who were sick. The mortality fell from 44% in 2013 to 31% in 2014. So administration of dextrose to sick children is very important, she says. Whether malnourishment and other factors also play a role merits further investigation.Our data supports a public health recommendation  minimising litchi consumption, eating evening meal throughout the outbreak period and implementing rapid glucose correction for suspected illness. These recommendations are specific to children in Muzaffarpur, she says."

Shivakumara Swamy, in a recent order, directed the CESC to pay Rs. 3.86 lakh with interest at 12 % from December 2015, the date on which the farmer lodged a complaint with them.The CESC has also been directed to pay Rs. 3,000 towards mental agony and deficiency in service and Rs. 2,000 towards costs."

However, it's sunstroke that claims maximum number of lives every year in the state.As per official records, 1,800-2,000 people die on an average every year in the state due to heat waves and sunstroke. This year too, there's prediction of a very hot summer. Given the situation, doctors call for setting up 'summer emergency mobile vans' at all major junctions in the city, equipped with the necessary medication and first aid, which can minimise deaths due to heatstroke.Physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao said, ""If a few timely precautions are taken and the government makes certain rules, thousands of lives can be saved in summer. Most importantly, depending on the size of cities and number of major junctions, summer emergency mobile vans can be stationed at all important junctions. For a city like Vizag, 12-15 vans would be required. The vans should be equipped with IV fluids, oxygen cylinders, cool water, first aid and a trained medical attendant. Toll free numbers can be provided by the government to call the vehicles to reach to the victim at the earliest and immediately treatment can commence. If the treatment gets delayed by a few hours, the victim may collapse and die.""""Besides, the labour department can change the working hours for labourers and outdoor workers during the severe summer months. Working hours can be scheduled before 10.30 am and after 4.30 pm to avoid the hottest sun between 11 am and 4 pm. For making the summer tolerable in future, the government shouldn't give permission or license for buildings educational institutes, offices or any building unless they have adequate space for plantation and greenery. Pamphlets should be distributed about the dos and don'ts in summer and announcements made through radio and television advertisements,"" added Dr Rao.On the personal level, public too should take certain precautions to avoid sunstroke. Doctors advise to always carry homemade ORS bottles by mixing a pinch of salt and a handful of sugar to boiled or clean drinking water at normal temperature, whenever they go out. Besides, people should also drink around three litres of water daily to keep themselves hydrated along with buttermilk, tender coconut water, fruit juice and so on. Using caps, sunglasses and umbrellas is also a must outdoors.The usual symptoms of sunstroke include fatigue and feeling of getting fainted, nausea, headache, cramps, breathlessness, thirst and inability to pass urine. The body temperature is often very high, around 104-105 degree Celsius."
58f52b3ea3d24b0b70c1e2a7,When chocolate meets science,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/When-chocolate-meets-science/article17287297.ece,2017-02-11,"Ever since I watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , Ive wondered what it would be like to be inside such a factory. Would the heady aroma of cocoa beans fill my senses? Would the gooey chocolate have me drooling? Would I get to dip my finger in a glossy pool of chocolate and sample some of it? Would I be able to experience the magical process that goes into creating one the most decadent guilty pleasures?All of this wondering came to a rather chocolatey end when I was invited to try my hand at making bean-to-bar chocolate. This wasnt like the regular chocolate-making workshops where one learns to make desserts with fillings, but the kind that takes you through the entire gamut. Theres everything from roasting and shelling cocoa beans, winnowing and grinding them, to finally melting and tempering the chocolate before pouring it into moulds to create your own bar.And no, Im not talking about mass-produced commercial chocolate. At Nitin Chordias Cocoashala in Chennai, its all about using pure ingredients to make chocolate, without the emulsifiers and stabilisers. What it also offers you is an opportunity to use home-grown cocoa beans. Think Pollachi, Coorg and Kerala.The right conditionAccording to Chordia, people dont realise that chocolate is a plant-based product. It grows well in tropical belts and always needs a shade tree to grow. Here, it is primarily grown in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, he says. While the two peak seasons are in February and October, farms harvest cocoa pods through the year. Expectedly, some of the best quality beans are found during the peak season.There are three basic varieties of the cocoa plant: criollo, the premium variety; forastero, which is what is found in India; and trinitario, a blend of the two. The colour of the cocoa pods, too, changes with the varieties. For instance, in India, it is common to find green and yellow ones and in South America, it is the more robust purple ones that hang lusciously from the plant. The flavour profiles differ depending on the terrain. While some boast berry notes, there are others that have a citrusy zing or floral notes. These, without any added infusions. Indian chocolate has a more earthy flavour profile.What also impacts the flavour profile of the cocoa bean is the duration for which it has been fermented, aerated, turned and dried. For instance, a batch of beans that had arrived at Chordias lab was still moist for lack of proper drying. Despite vigorous roasting, the cacao nibs from this particular batch lacked the robust flavour of well-fermented and dried cocoa beans. The dank smell was a dead giveaway. In some cases, this impacts the finished product, with the chocolate tasting and smelling odd.All about the processWhile traditionally, cocoa beans are roasted in a coffee bean roaster, here we set about doing so in an open pan, since we were working with a small batch. The roasting is essential to remove moisture from the bean, though there are variants of chocolate for which this process is skipped altogether. The roasting also makes it easier to shell the beans before they are put into the winnower to separate the nibs and shells. The beans are usually roasted at around 120 degrees celsius for about 20-25 minutes, but it depends on the chocolatiers judgement. What is important, though, is that the beans are constantly turned to avoid burning.What follows is the beautiful process of grinding. Beautiful, because it is this process that gives chocolate its lovely gloss and smoothness. It is here that the nibs transform into a gooey paste. It is also at this stage that a hint of sugar (more, if one wants sweeter chocolate) and pure vanilla are introduced to bring out the robust chocolate flavours. Typically, the cacao is ground for around three days. This process includes conching (a low pulsing process used to give the ground chocolate its characteristic smell and texture). The amount of time for which the chocolate is conched is also what lends it a smoothness and a better mouthfeel.It is after this process that the chocolate is poured into a mould and readied, either to be shipped to a chocolatier or to an industry where it is put between hydraulic presses to extract cocoa butter, which is used in the cosmetic industry. The residual product after the extraction is used to make drinking chocolate and compound chocolate (what is available in grocery stores). Fine chocolates retain the cocoa butter, as this is what lends chocolate its character.Chocolate with cocoa butter is also a lot more delicate and needs to be handled with care. To develop it further, the chocolate is melted to about 50 degrees celsius before it is tempered (expertly swished around on a stone slab to bind all the fatty crystals in the chocolate) to a temperature of 29-27 degrees.In this case, it is Chordias wife, Poonam, who does the tempering. I watch, fascinated, as she deftly handles the mass of gooey chocolate with a spatula. The chocolate is then again heated to 32 degrees celsius. This process is important, says Chordia. It gives chocolate its snap and sheen and brings out the flavours better. For chocolate with cocoa butter, this is a very important process. And just like that, the chocolate is ready to either be poured into moulds to form a bar, or create truffles and ganache treats.Look for Cocoashala on Facebook or visit cocoatrait.com for more details"

Sugarmill Owner's Association told The Hindu that the mills have paid over 78% of the total dues to the cane growers.The figure of Rs. 5,975 is the money which sugar mills owe to the farmers and would be the dues after 14 days but the actual dues stands at only Rs. 3,666 crore. We have already paid about 78% of the total dues and we are looking forward to pay back to the cane growers as soon as possible, Mr. Guptara said."

Residents have even refused to vote in the elections, telling the government, ""Go get the tigers to vote, since they call the shots here, not us.""On February 11, a forest department team did manage to corner and tranquilise a tiger which they said had killed six villagers since November 28.The big cat was then sent to Lucknow Zoo.

Majority of the sugar mills are shut and distressed and indebted cane-growers are reportedly facing near starvation.The highest ever production estimation was revealed by a state delegation at a high-level meeting called by the Centre in Delhi two days ago to assess sugar production in the country. UP's figures of around 80 lakh tonne surprised the Centre and representatives of other cane growing states as with this the state is all set to record the highest ever sugar production.Talking to ToI, secretary general of UP Sugar Mills Association, Deepak Guptara said that the farmers deserve special mention for introducing varietal changes in the crop and researchers for the new high yielding crops, while the state government played a key role in implementation of the plans and programmes which resulted in another feather to UP's cap. He, however, added that the climatic changes in Maharashtra were also a factor in sharp decline in sugar production in that state.With the highest sugar production in UP this year, to be declared officially by March end, the sugar industry is all set for a revolution as cane and related activities are to get a boost and its benefits are to be harvested by the farmers, mainly nearly 35 lakh sugarcane growers.The record production of sugar will not only stabilise the price of the product in the market, but would also result in timely payments to cane-growers, even as sugar mills would profit from selling more. In the previous cane year, the state had produced 68.55 lakh tonne. Guptara shared, ""We are selling the sugar substantially in sugar deficient states this time.""The record production in sugar is linked to increase of sugar recovery in sugarcane from around 9 per cent till last year to more than 10 per cent this year. It also got a push with growth in productivity from 59 tonne per hectare to 67 tonne per hectare. Moreover, the government has been able to overcome the barrier of transfer of hybrid and high quality seeds of sugar from lab to land.The government is confident that a record sugar production will not only invite more investment in sugar mills' expansion and modernization programmes, but also restore the faith of cane-growers in cane cultivation."

Though gestational diabetes emerged as a major health problem in the last decade, it was only in 2016 that doctors decided to dedicate a special day to focus on the elevated blood sugar levels in women during pregnancy.Though this temporary or gestational diabetes recedes within a few months after delivery, it continues to stay as normal diabetes in some women. The incidence of gestational diabetes is increasing in Hyderabad with about 15 per cent of pregnant women reporting elevated levels of blood sugar. It eventually causes health complications in mother and child.The Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DPSI), whose brainchild is the National Gestational Diabetes Day, points out that gestatio nal diabetes mellitus is a ""transient abnormality of glucose intolerance during pregnancy"". The DPSI, however, warns that women suffering from gestational diabetes are at ""increased risk of future diabetes"".Children born to such women also carry the risk of diabetes in their adult life.According to Dr Manjula Anagani, head of MaxCure Suyosha Woman & Child Hospital, one of the contributing factors for gestational diabetes is endocrinal disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome. Other factors are obesity and sedentary lifestyle. ""Pregnant women need to check their blood sugars every three months. If it turns out to be gestational diabetes, the pregnant woman needs to keep a watch on her weight. She should not put on more than seven or eight kilos,"" Dr Manjula observes.She recommends that pregnant women should also keep a check on her weight and blood sugar level after the delivery. This is because about 25 per cent of women diagnosed with gestational diabetes run the risk of sustaining the problem.Nutrition expert Dr Sri Latha suggests that those diagnosed with gestational diabetes should follow a strict diet regimen. ""They should plan a strict split meal pattern with a two-hour gap,"" she points out, recommending replacement of carbohydrates with a protein diet and good amount of complex carbohydrates like whole grains and cereals.""A meal should be packed with large amount of vegetables and greens. Frequent healthy snacks like boiled grams and sprouts are suggested between the meals.They should also consume liquids like buttermilk. They should avoid simple sugars,"" adds Dr Latha.The DPSI in its guidelines recommends that in view of high prevalence of gestational diabetes in India, there should be compulsory screening for all pregnant women. It also calls for a team approach for comprehensive treatment of the problem. ""The team should comprise obstetrician, diabetes physician, diabetes educator, dietitian, midwife and paediatrician,"" the DPSI suggests."

The distribution of scholarships among students of scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST) and extremely backward caste (EBC) sections would also be done the same month. The school uniforms would be given to students of Class I to Class VIII and bicycles to students of Class IX.State chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh on Thursday gave this directive to the education department officials at a meeting of the departmental heads convened to review the department wise spends made till February 8. Singh also directed the panchayati raj department to transfer funds to the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) concerned soon. Besides, the departments have to inform the elected representatives from the districts concerned about the government schemes under implementation.Singh said the eligibility criterion to receive the cash component for school uniforms and bicycles is 75% and more school attendance by a student. It is expected that the government spend on purchase of the school uniforms and bicycles, as well as payment of scholarships to SC, ST and EBC students, would together jack up the expenditure of the education department, which, otherwise, stood at 55.75% of the revised plan outlay (Rs 12,068 crore) for the department.The other senior officials who participated in the review meeting included development commissioner Shishir Sinha and planning and development department principal secretary Deepak Prasad , along with principal secretaries and secretaries of other departments. The meeting took note of the fact that the overall government spend till February 8 during the current fiscal was 49.49% of the approved plan outlay, or 44.56% of the revised plan outlay.The total approved plan outlay for 2016-17 was Rs 71,501 crore, which, however, was revised to Rs 79,412 crore. The government spend till February 8 was Rs 35,385 crore against the approved plan outlay. The same during the last financial year was Rs 34,546 crore. It is also learnt that the Centre had released only Rs 15,953 crore of central share till January 31 against its approved outlay of Rs 28,777 crore (later revised to Rs 32,951 crore) to be spent on the execution of centrally sponsored schemes.The plan expenditure of nine departments was less than 30%.

His blood glucose levels were below 100mg/dL after the eight-hour fasting test and, a test two hours after a meal had a reading of below 140mg/dL (milligrams per decilitre). But 10 months later, physicians confirmed that he was diabetic.Doctors said a third test  an hour into the two-hour gap between the post-fast and the after-meal tests  could have predicted he was likely to contract the disease and help delay its onset.But Menon's physician and the lab didn't ask for the test, due to lack of awareness or because they did not take scientific evidence seriously, and could not warn Menon that he was at risk of diabetes. This despite the fact that research papers from across the world have for more than two years showed that an elevated sugar level an hour after the first test is a significant indicator of a diabetes threat even if the two other tests return results within the normal glucose range.More than a dozen studies in the past two years have warned that risk of diabetes is high if the result of 1-hour post-meal test is 155mg/dL.The country has a huge number of diabetics, doctors say, but is among those in which doctors delay diagnosis. Several hospitals in the city, particularly those that specialise in diabetes, now prescribe the three-prick test, but it is not standard practice among all doctors and diagnostic labs.Senior diabetologist Dr V Seshiah said unless it part of disgnostic guidelines, doctors cannot advise patients to take the third test. ""For now, if the two-hour post-meal sugar level is 140 or more, the person is diabetic,"" he said.Multiple tests for diabetes are not new. In the '70s, most doctors pricked their patients four times post-meal  after 30 minutes, one hour, 90 minutes and two hours  following the fasting test. Doctors conducted the tests will the late '90s.""We cut down on pricks because it was physically painful,"" diabetologist Dr V Mohan said. ""After studying cases of thousands of patients, we found that three prick tests were effective.""For the three-prick test, labs test patients after fasting, give them 75g of glucose, test them twice more. Three tests instead of two may increase the cost by Rs150, but doctors say it could be vital. More than 8% of women and nearly 12% of men in India have diabetes and, with a prevalence of diabetes of more than 25% in cities, India has more diabetics than most countries.Many doctors want guidelines permitting the three-prick test. The Indian Council of Medical Research prepared guidelines for doctors to treat diabetes in 2005. Doctors say an update is needed as there have been many scientific developments over the past 12 years.ICMR director Soumya Swaminathan said the guidelines are due for revision. ""We will have to analyse the results of all the research studies,"" she said. ""If we find convincing scientific evidence, then we must make it a policy."""

The prevalence of gestational diabetes in the city, however, is about 15 per cent. Some hospitals report a higher incidence.As part of the research, 237 pregnant women were observed. Of them, 137 showed gestational diabetes. The remaining (100) women had normal glucose levels. Among the pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, 58.4 per cent had a family history of Type 2 diabetes.The women with elevated blood sugar levels were in the age group of 22 to 38 years. The average age was 26.7 years.Dr Faraz Farishta, consultant endocrinologist at MaxCure Hospital , points out that there is definitely an increase in occurrence of gestational diabetes.This is mainly due to obesity and sedentary lifestyle. ""I used to see a month between 40 and 50 gestational diabetes patients referred by gynaecologists. Now, I am seeing more such patients. Their number has increased to about 90 a month,"" said Dr Faraz.He said about 40 per cent of gestational diabetics can be managed with diet regulation. But about 60 per cent of patients require insulin therapy to control the sugar level. ""The increase in gestational diabetes has become a new challenge for pregnant mothers,"" he adds.Dr Faraz warns that uncontrolled gestational diabetes could lead to maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality.""Improved outcomes, therefore, rely on early diagnosis and tight glycaemic control,"" he adds. It is the most common of diabetes in pregnant women resulting in complications in almost 90 per cent of pregnancies.Gestational diabetes is a temporary phase of elevated blood sugar levels in pregnant women.While gestational diabetes generally subsides within a few months, the problem continues to persist in a large number of women even after delivery in Hyderabad."

Volume growth has been in the low single digits for at least four quarters as consumers in urban markets increasingly prefer healthier drinks, while in the rural areas, theyve been scaling down on discretionary spending.Nooyi told analysts the company was making significant progress in transforming its portfolio.The maker of Pepsi and Mountain Dew fizzy drinks and Lays chips said last year it would reduce the sugar content in juices and carbonated drinks across markets including India by 2025. Nooyi said the company had a pipeline of innovations such as Tropicana Essentials functional juices and Quaker foods, which she said were helping to fuel sales in developed markets such as the US.Globally, the Pepsi cola trademark contributes 12% of net revenue, while 25% comes from everyday nutrition products such as bottled water and foods and drinks packed with grains, fruits and vegetables.Food and beverage makers are facing pressure from consumers, health activists and governments to make their products healthier in order to rein in obesity and diseases such as diabetes.Measures to reduce sugar include replacing it with natural and artificial sweeteners and making smaller packs of beverages and snacks.

Considerable chunk of population from both urban and rural areas have been suffering from obesity. ""As far as urban areas are concerned, about 30% to 65% adults are either overweight or obese or have abdominal obesity,"" senior nephrologist Sudhir Kulkarni said.He said the additional weight put up on body causes stress in the functioning of kidneys. ""The obesity and blood filtration rate of kidneys are directly proportional.

Conlan is with the same company and will make his pro debut at Madison Square Garden's theater on St. Patrick's Day.And then there is Claressa Shields, who is a step ahead of both. The two-time Olympic middleweight champion opened her career in November with a win on the undercard of the Andre Ward-Sergey Kovalev fight in Las Vegas. She will become the first woman to headline a fight card on premium cable when she fights in Detroit March 10 on Showtime.The 21-year-old Shields has plans just as big as Stevenson and Conlan, even though women's boxing has largely been ignored by most boxing fans in recent years.``I believe 150 percent in my boxing ability,'' she told The Associated Press before her first pro fight, a four-round decision over Franchon Crews. ``I know I'm a great fighter. I fight better than 90 percent of the men who box now. I just know that, and I'm not at my best yet.''Shields is the only American fighter _ male or female _ to win a gold medal since Ward captured one in Athens in 2004. Her story of fighting out of poverty in Flint, Michigan, resonates with many, and she is not afraid to speak her mind about her abilities or the state of the sport of boxing.She also showed another side in Rio, when she gathered Stevenson in her arms after his gold medal split decision loss to Cuba's Robeisy Ramirez. Shields, who was to fight for her second gold the next day, spent several minutes consoling her teammate and telling him there would be better things in his future.``I trained my whole life for that one moment,'' Stevenson said of his gold medal fight. ``I failed and it hurt. I didn't get to realize how far I had really come.''Stevenson was sought in Rio by promoters who saw a lot of Leonard and De La Hoya in a fighter with slick moves and a dazzling smile. Floyd Mayweather Jr. spent time with him in Rio and talked about signing the fighter for his promotion company, but never gave him an offer.Stevenson said he took less guaranteed money from Top Rank because of the company's success in building up Olympic fighters such as Mayweather, De La Hoya and Miguel Cotto.``I like the fact that they build superstars. They have the best track record around,'' said Stevenson, who got his first name from the late rapper Tupac Shakur. ``It's going to take a few years, but I think I can be a star, too.''Stevenson, the oldest of nine children who began boxing at the age of 7 in the Newark, New Jersey gym run by his grandfather, Walli Moses, does not yet have a date or an opponent for his debut. He will begin his pro career in the 126-pound featherweight division.Conlan will fight as a super batamweight in his first bout, a scheduled six-rounder against Colorado's Tim Ibarra, who is 4-4. He's expecting to be the big favorite of a heavily Irish crowd in his debut at 122 pounds.``I truly believe in my ability. I'm a fighter who speaks with complete confidence at all times,'' he said. ``No matter who's in front of me, no matter what day it is, no one's going to beat me.''Conlan didn't win a medal in Rio, but he did make some news. After losing a controversial decision to Russia's Vladimir Nikitin he flashed obscene gestures at the judges, then sent a tweet to Vladimir Putin suggesting the Russian president helped fix the fight.``Hey Vlad,'' he tweeted. ``How much did they charge you bro??''Stevenson sees a possible big fight with Conlan once they both make names for themselves as a pro.``I can't wait for me and Michael Conlan to meet up in a big fight down the line,'' he said."

Sugar prices touched a life time high of Rs 3,950 per quintal on NCDEX twice last week. Prices would remain high given the tight supply situation, experts tracking the sector said.The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) had lowered its estimates for sugar production during the 2016-17 season (October-September) to 21.3 mt in January due to drought in key cane growing states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka. ISMA projected sugar production at 23.4 mt for 2016-17 during its first advance estimates of the crop in September last yearSugar production is estimated to have declined 11% y-o-y to 25.2 mt in the 2015-16 season. An opening stock of around 7.6 mt would result in the overall sugar availability of about 29 mt during the 2016-17 season, which would be able to meet the domestic demand of around 25 mt, analysts said. This would result in carryover stocks remaining in the tight range of 4.6-4.8 mt when the new sugar crushing season commences in November this year, they said.""Due to tight carryover stocks the country may need to import sugar later in the season to meet demand until cane crushing gathers pace by December,"" said Ritesh Kumar Sahu, analyst, agri commodities, Angel Broking.""Thus, we expect the price to touch Rs 4,000 per quintal in futures market during the current season as the crushing season comes to end in Maharashtra and Karnataka early,"" he said. Ratings agency ICRA said that it expects sugar prices in the domestic market to remain firm in the near term, given the deficit situation in the country and international markets.""Sugar prices are likely to remain firm over the next two to three quarters,"" said Sabyasachi Majumdar, head, corporate ratings, ICRA. ""Further, with the crushing season drawing to a close in both Maharashtra and Karnataka and both reporting a lower-than-expected output the possibility of the actual output for SY (sugar year) 2017 falling even below the government's estimates cannot be ruled out,"" he stated.Expectations of a decline in output have been driving up sugar prices, which have increased from around Rs 31,500 per tonne in March 2016 to Rs 36,000 per tonne in October 2016. Prices dropped marginally following the demonetisation exercise to around Rs 35,000-35,500 per tonne in November and December. With projections of further fall in domestic production, sugar prices firmed up to to Rs 36,700 per tonne in January."

Based on the documents submitted by contenders in a RFQ, firms are chosen to offer financial bids under the request for proposal (RFP).Before going for the RFPs, a clearance is required from the ministry of home affairs (MHA) for the bidding companies and its directors. All the bidders for the RFQ, except IRB Group, have submitted their documents for MHA verification.Sources following the developments said the company was given repeated reminders to submit the documents, but it did not respond. Finally, MIL sent the documents of the other five companies for MHA clearance. IRB has been intimated that now it is out of the race for Nagpur airport.The company did not respond even when it was informed that it is now out of the race, said a source. Officials of IRB have admitted in informal discussions that the company is no longer interested in the project, sources said.MIL is expecting to get the draft document for RFP from the consultants by next week. The bids will be called for soon after the MHA clearance. The clearance is mandatory, which includes verifying credentials of all directors of the company, said a source.MIL, which is a joint venture of state government-owned MADC and Airports Authority of India (AAI), plans to offload its 74% stake to a private player.

The animal got separated from the herd and fell into the open well. Forest rangers and anti-poaching watchers who were patrolling the area on Tuesday heard the cries of an animal in distress and found the animal in the well in an area covered with the invasive karuvelam trees.Personnel of the forest department and the fire and rescue services began the rescue operation on Wednesday morning. ""Animals generally feel the difference in the ground level, but since the well was not fenced the animal might have slipped and fallen into it,"" said environmentalist Mohan Raj , who saw through the rescue operation.The lower 40 ft of the well had concrete rings. On Wednesday night, forest officials cut a path up to the edge of the concrete area. ""We removed the sand to make way for a vehicle to reach this point.

It was also given medicines concealed in the jackfruit to keep it fit.On Thursday morning, the calf was given a mild sedative. ""By 11 am it calmed down. We sent down four experienced mahouts into the well who tied belts with hooks around its legs, neck and body,"" said forest veterinarian Dr Ashokan. The animal, which weighed around two tonnes, was lifted out with a crane.The calf had sustained bruises on the head, trunk and hind legs in the fall.

But supplies are falling even from this centuries-old Arabian sea route that is one of the last lifelines to a country on the brink of famine.A two-year-old civil war has severely restricted the flow of food into the main Yemeni cargo ports of Hodeidah and Salif on the Red Sea, where all the large grain silos are located.The small wooden boats sailing from souks in the UAE are moving small but vital supplies by making for the smaller ports to the south coast that are of little use to larger vessels - and often sidestepping military inspections that choke traffic by dropping anchor at secluded coves nearby.The deals originate in the sprawling Al Ras Market, a collection of dusty alleyways near the Dubai Creek where an array of food and spices are on display including colourful sacks of Pakistani and Indian rice.The dhows - plying the ancient trade route that once carried the likes of pearls, frankincense and myrrh - supply 14,000 to 18,000 tonnes of foodstuffs a month to Yemen, according to traders. That represents a drop of about 30-40 percent over the past year because of problems with payment, as well as adverse sailing conditions.""The Yemeni currency is destroyed, sometimes we can't get paid enough. We can only go once a month because the seas are too rough,"" said trader Mohammed Hassan, at a docking station at nearby Port Khaled in Sharjah""Sometimes we have to wait 40 days.""The volumes of food carried on this route represent a small fraction of the supply to Yemen, which relies on imports for 90 percent of its food. But it has become increasingly important as fighting has raged, the economy has collapsed and Yemen has needed all the help it can get.PORT DAMAGEThousands of people have been killed in the civil war pits the Iran-allied Houthi group against a Saudi-backed coalition - which includes the UAE - fighting to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.The conflict has choked imports. Sixty percent of Yemenis, or 17 million people, are in ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" food situations, according to the United Nations.While vessels seeking access to Houthi-held areas must face inspections for smuggled weapons, the government-controlled south has less restrictions.Food imports into Hodeidah have fallen relentlessly, with only a few ships arriving each week - compared with dozens before the war - and more shipping lines pulling out due to the growing risks, according to aid and shipping sources.In recent weeks damage to infrastructure in the neighbouring port of Salif has also cut food deliveries, aid officials said.""The country is living on its reserves,"" said Robert Mardini, International Committee of the Red Cross regional director for the Near and Middle East in Geneva this week.""There is a lack of liquidity, no payment of salaries, which means that the spending power has collapsed and that the price of food is soaring whenever it is available.""'PAY THUGS'UAE-based dhow captains avoid these snarl-ups by steering clear of the big Red Sea ports and instead ply their trade to the south, often docking at informal inlets.The average journey takes about five to eight days, with the boats capable of taking up to 2,000 tonnes of goods, still small fry compared with cargo ships that could provide more relief to one of the poorest and most unstable countries in the world.Trader Ali Mahdani ships his goods out of Dubai to the southern Yemeni ports of Aden, Mukalla or Mokha, goods worth 4-6 million UAE dirhams ($1.1-1.6 million) per month, around 2,000 tonnes of mostly rice, spices or cooking oil. To avoid payments in the battered Yemeni currency he gets paid in Saudi riyals.There are few issues upon arrival. That's a sharp contrast the scrutiny that any vessels hoping to access the north would be subjected to as the Saudi-led coalition search for weapons which may be headed into Houthi hands.""You may have to pay thugs every once in a while but otherwise it is all good to go,"" said Mahdani, dressed in a flowing white robe.Trader Amin Baghersh ships powered milk, tomato paste, sugar and rice from Al Ras to Yemen, selling about one million UAE dirhams worth per month.He and others rely on hawala, an informal trading system through exchange houses based on trust and personal ties.Most of his goods make their way to Mukalla and Aden and surrounding areas. But he, like others, has taken a heavy hit from the Yemeni currency crisis and payment problems caused by the war.An Iranian trader had similar complaints.""I used to transfer about 2,000 tonnes of food a month,"" said the trader, who declined to give his name. ""In the last three or four months people asked me for supplies but I am reluctant to deal with them.""($1 = 3.6724 UAE dirham)(Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Pravin Char)"

The brand has tried to keep pace with the changing times. Today, along with its legendary handmade, fresh fruit fresh ice creams such as pineapple, mango, chikoo and custard apple, among others, Famous also began selling frozen desserts along the way.While the handmade ice creams, which consist of seasonal fruits, cream and sugar, are prepared at the shop under the supervision of the owners, the frozen desserts are prepared at the factory that is located near Nehru Zoo Park.And it is not just quality that Famous Ice Cream has managed to maintain, it has also kept the prices pocket-friendly for the 'Aam Aadmi' despite soaring prices of raw materials such as milk, fruit, sugar and cream.""Believe it or not... one scoop of handmade ice cream used to cost anywhere between 25-50 paise when our grandfather used to run the show. Even today, if you see, our ice cream is priced very reasonably at Rs 30-40 per scoop. Margins are not very high and we rely mainly on volumes,"" he explains, pointing out that Famous has abstained from hiking prices in the past three years.So how can they afford to dish out these delicious cool scoops? ""We have been managing somehow... on an average, we serve 900-1,000 customers per week,"" he says.Of course, business peaks during summers as well as the month of Ramzaan, when the outlet, which generally downs shutters by 12.30 am, stays open till 2 am to 2.30 am to cater to the festive demand.But as competition hots up, with an increasing number of outlets of players like Scoops, Cream Stone and Natural mushrooming across the city, Famous feels the time is now ripe to make some changes in the mix.In keeping with the changing times, it is now planning to introduce a new range of sugar free ice creams to cater to health conscious ice cream connoisseurs. It is also mulling a presence in the upmarket Hi-Tech City area with an ice cream parlour in the next one year. But will Hyderabadis in the happening IT district too get to savour Famous ice creams at Rs 30 per scoop? ""Of course not!"" pat comes the reply.One of the main reasons that Famous has been able to keep its prices low is because of the lower rent of around Rs 1 lakh per annum it pays for the space at the Moazzam Jahi market to the Telangana government. For a similar kind of space in the Hi-Tech city area, it may have to shell out a similar amount by way of rentals for just one or two months."

Major landmarks of the town including the railway station, bus stand and the police station are located on this stretch.Among local people, unemployment is a major issue particularly after the numerous mills and private industries that used to operate out of the township closed down. In the past, there were industries run by the Modi group which used to produce cloth, oil, tyres and lanterns apart from dozens of other products.""The local youth are unemployed after the mills closed down. Only a sugar mill runs in the township. But that's not enough to provide largescale employment. Successive governments have failed to generate employment opportunities in the region,"" said Jitender Kumar Chaudhary, a local trader.The farming community in Modinagar is largely dependent on cane production. However, cane farming has also been hit due to lack of timely payment of dues. In the past two decades, several private educational institutes have cropped up in Modinagar making it an education hub.A plethora of private higher educational institutes offering engineering, dental and management courses dot the Modinagar township.""Farmers and those who lost their livelihoods from the mill closures cannot afford to send their children to these private colleges. Not a single government has ever thought about providing adequate educational facilities for the local youth in Modinagar. The mills should be revived to garner more employment opportunities,"" said Kanchilal, a local resident.Demonetization seems to have had an impact on the petty traders who were dealing only in cash till late. Only one of the seven ATMs in the main market had cash when TOI visited the township.A section of traders was nonetheless all praise about Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Modi has a huge following here. The Samajwadi Party does not have enough confidence to win the polls. That's why they have teamed up with Congress,"" said Shiv Kumar, a local resident.Voters in the assembly constituency said issues surrounding cane cultivation have always decided the outcome of elections in Modinagar. The Chaudhary Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) has a strong political base in the region given its politics over the plight of cane farmers.Out of the eight assembly seats in NCR, Modinagar was the only one in which a candidate belonging to the RLD had won the elections in 2012. Sudesh Sharma of the RLD had trounced his nearest rival, Rajpal Singh of the BSP, by 13,949 votes.The assembly segment of Modinagar is under Baghpat parliamentary constituency. In the last Lok Sabha elections, former Mumbai police commissioner Satyapal Singh won from the area on BJP ticket. RLD supremo Ajit Singh trailed at third position in Modinagar.This time, Modinagar is the only seat in NCR from which a major political party has fielded a woman candidate. The BJP has fielded city-based gynecologist, Dr Manju Siwach, as its candidate from Modinagar."

It would conclude on Tuesday.Officials from AYUSH ministry, along with regional advisor World Health Organisation Dr Kim Sungcheol and president Indo-Swiss Ayurved Foundation will take part in the conference. National Institute of Ayurveda Dr Sanjeev Sharma said that the theme of the seminar is diabetes. The ministry of AYUSH set the theme on diabetes as its cases are continuously on the rise.According to recently released annual health survey, in the state, 9.5% of population above 18 years, have blood sugar level equal to or greater than 110mg/dl. Besides, 3.4% have blood sugar level equal to or greater than 130mg/dl and 1.7% population is that having equal to or greater than 150mg/dl blood sugar level.Dr Sharma said that in the three-day seminar, 540 papers will be presented, majority of them are on diabetes. Besides, 1,200 delegates have already sent their consent to take part in the international conference. Besides, there are 100 foreign delegates from America, Switzerland and nine other countries having interest in Ayurvada would also attend the seminar.National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA) spokesperson Dr CR Yadav said that the conference will be beneficial for those suffering from diabetes. Also, an exhibition would also be inaugurated, which will show how diabetes can be prevented.At present, NIA's focus is on diabetes and its control. Recently, it has celebrated the first National Ayurveda Day with the theme, Ayurveda for Prevention and Control of Diabetes.The ministry of ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (Ayush), recently, announced its decision to observe Dhanvantari Jayanti, popularly known as Dhanteras, as National Ayurveda Day every year. Since Dhanteras had fallen on October 28, the first National Ayurveda Day had observed on that day.NIA officials said that they had selected diabetes as the theme as it's an emerging challenge and more people are becoming victims of the disease."

The heart benefit has since been incorporated into Jardiance's label.AstraZeneca is conducting its own large clinical trials to determine the heart effect of Farxiga with results expected in 2019.But the latest data presented by Dr. Mikhail Kosiborod at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington appears to indicate that heart protection is not limited to Jardiance.""The fact that the results are remarkably consistent from country to country regardless of which compound predominates, that certainly seems to suggest that it's a class effect,"" said Kosiborod, a cardiologist from Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City. He noted that most Americans in the data were taking Invokana, while Farxiga was dominant in Europe.The study, which analyzed data from more than 300,000 type 2 diabetes patients collected from six countries, found the SGLT-2 drugs slashed the combined risk of hospitalization for heart failure and death from any cause by 46 percent.The data was obtained from real-world sources, such as medical records, claims databases and national registers.Most patients were taking Farxiga or Invokana with less than 10 percent on Jardiance. The comparator medicines included a wide variety of diabetes treatments, including metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, such as Merck & Co's Januvia, and insulin, among others.The vast majority of patients had no history of heart disease. But heart disease is the number one killer of people with diabetes, and mounting evidence of heart protective qualities of SGLT-2 drugs could lead to greater use.""This class has a real potential of improving patient outcomes,"" Kosiborod said.Given the observational nature of the study the possibility of unmeasured confounding factors exists, researchers noted.More than 400 million people worldwide have diabetes, of whom at least 90 percent have type 2.

Celebrated since 3,000 years, the festival occurs on the first day of the first month of the Fasli calender. For Mumbai's minuscule peace loving Zoroastrian community comprising 50,000 odd Parsis and Iranis, Navroze is celebrated with a lot of fervour.The numerous Parsi baugs dotted along the city come alive with the cheerful greetings of 'Navroze Mubarak' after which the faithful make a trip to the neighbourhood agiary or atash behram  most of them in south Mumbai  to pray and offer sandalwood to the holy fire that burns inside. The agiaries have been scrupulously cleaned in the days leading to Navroze and decorated with beautiful divas and fresh flowers. Some Zoroastrians have jasans  thanksgiving prayers performed by priests  at home while some make a trip to the Iranshah at Udwada  the holiest place of worship for Zoroastrians.Houses are spruced up, the most expensive China and fancy linen is brought out, colourful intricate rangoli is made at the entrance and colourful bead and glass torans are hung across thresholds. According to ancient customs, the Iranis lay down a special table, where the Khordeh Avesta (holy book) is placed along with a lamp or candle, sprouted wheat or beans, a bowl with a silver coin, flowers, sweets, rosewater, mirror and bowl of water. Seven food items beginning with 'sh' in Persian  wine, sugar, milk, sweet meat, honey, sweets and syrup  are placed along with fruits, dried fruits and nuts. Signifying prosperity, wealth and happiness among other things, the table is considered an auspicious part of celebrations.The highlight of the day, of course, is the food  no Parsi occasion is complete without a scrumptious meal. The day begins with the tempting aroma of frying vermicelli or sev in ghee with sugar, almonds, raisins and charoli. Some homes make the rava, which is white and has almonds and raisins on top. Breakfast also comprises the Parsi poro, an omelette of tomatoes, green chillies, onions, kothmir or the akuri, which is scrambled. Lunch could be Sali Boti, Dhan Dal Patia or Mutton Dhansak. Dessert is jalebi, sutarfeni, falooda or kulfi.After the indispensable afternoon siesta, it is time to host a get-together at home, meet old friends at the Parsi Gymkhana or spend the evening watching a play or the latest movie, followed by dinner at a fancy restaurant. While the naataks are nowhere as popular as they used to be during the time of the late Adi Marzban , known for his outrageous Gujarati plays, there are still plenty of other choices. Navroze Mubarak to all!"

However, experts feel the fibre or lint content should also be considered as an equally important factor.The argument is that higher lint or ginning per cent (GP) indicates better quality cotton, with lesser wastage. This will not only fetch a better price for farmers but also better quality cotton for further processing by ginners. Farmers and ginners are already demanding inclusion of GP in fixing the cotton price. However, this will not be easy, since incorporating GP as a measure of quality will require instrumentation at every step in cotton purchase and processing.Experts say cotton farmers have always been at the receiving end due to varied reasons, like bad weather, low minimum support price (MSP), rising production costs, low production etc. The cotton procurement system too is unfair since it does not include GP.GP represents the actual percentage of fibre in the raw seed-cotton sold by farmers. GP should be the most important parameter in evaluating quality since it determines the net amount of cotton fibre (lint) available after separating the seeds (ginning). Higher the GP, more is the fibre content, so such cotton should fetch higher price.""However, ginners and government purchasing departments are unable to quantify lint quantity at point of purchase. This deprives farmers of higher profit for their produce. In fact, government should fix cotton MSP by lint quantity, just like sugar content sets the price for sugar cane. This will benefit farmers as well ginners and spinners. The current cotton grading, by estimating fibre qualities with visual inspection, results in different assessment by every individual,"" said a cotton scientist.Experts say other countries, where cotton productivity and GP are high, the cotton price is fairly standardized, because of the fewer varieties, unlike India, where cotton hybrids are in hundreds. Since India's GP is around 32-33%, much below the world average 38-42%, farmers as well ginners get much less price. An increase of just 1% in GP results in 3% higher fibre yields and ginners profit margin. If the GP of Indian cotton is increased 4-5% from current levels, ginners would realize about 12-15% (450-550kg/quintal) more cotton, and can pass on some profit to farmers too.Director of Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) Keshav Kranthi agrees that farmers as well as ginners would benefit with higher ginning percentage cotton. But he adds that such a change in system would require strong political will and administrative efforts. Instruments would be required at every step, from collecting centres handling different hybrids to ginners segregating cotton by GP to offer different prices for cotton. Small units of Lilliput gins and small balances would be needed at every market yard to estimate GP.""A few recent Bt cotton hybrids have 37-39% GP. Almost all desi cotton varieties have GP of over 40%. Some desi varieties have as much as 44% GP. Unfortunately, these do not command a higher price currently even if they are better than the American cotton hybrids. There could be a separate category of cotton with higher GP in the MSP list,"" he said.""Surprisingly, currently ginners discourage desi cotton, because double roller gins are unsuitable for ginning it. We also need adjustable double roller gins for desi cotton, so a system can be developed to pay higher price for higher GP at the market yards,"" said Dr Kranthi."

Overlooked since the Green Revolution of the 1960s, these forgotten food grains are on the comeback trail precisely because they have proven to be drought-resistant.Tamil Nadu was reported to have produced over 29 lakh tonnes of millet last year (up from 9 lakh tonnes), a significant shift indeed away from polished rice. The food grain production went up from 110 lakh tonne to 128 lakh tonne last year.The low glycaemic index of millets (a measure of how fast our body converts food into sugar) compared to rice, is one of its many nutritional advantages. Many health experts think that switching over to millets will decrease the future risk of diabetes.The number of non-governmental organisations promoting organic farming and ethnic food grain cultivation has grown in Tamil Nadu, including its Tier II cities like Tiruchi. The recent three-day ethnic food festival organised by the Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meals Programme and Integrated Child Development Services Scheme in Tiruchi, was proof of this revival. But more than just food, there is also a growing awareness about an alternative lifestyle that respects nature.Millets missionThe parent company of Mithraa Millets, Sri K.S. Lakshmi Agri Clinic and Agri Extension Centre, is better known for its innovative device, a helmet fitted with a rechargeable light that helps jasmine harvesters in Tiruchi district to go into the fields early in the morning or late at night, and stay safe from injury and snakebites.In fact, proprietor and agricultural entrepreneur K.Suresh Kumar is in Hyderabad to receive an award for the helmet (distributed to 360 farmers in Tiruchi district in collaboration with the National Horticultural Mission) when we call him.As a graduate in Agricultural Science, I wanted to do something useful for the farming community and also for our own food habits. Most agriculturists are not educated, and usually go for high yield crops that need chemical fertlizers and pesticides. We are trying to refocus their attention on traditional and eco-friendly methods of farming, says Mr.Suresh Kumar, whose venture is the first agri-clinic of its kind in Tamil Nadu.For the past two years, their food brand Mithraa Millets has been popularising alternatives to the rice-based dishes with its millet flour and plant-origin ready mixes. Among the products that the brand has developed are dosa/pancake, puttu (steamed flour) and other ready mixes from kambu (pearl millet), cornmeal and kezhvaragu (finger millet).Ragi and kambu should come back into our diets in a big way, says Mr.Suresh Kumar. The other millets were more commonly used as cattle fodder.The company operates two stalls at the Uzhavar Sandhai (Farmers Market) in Anna Nagar and K. K. Nagar. We are doing this so that the farmer can earn a reasonable amount as profit, and also make millet-based foods available to more people.The stall at Anna Nagar does brisk business in steamed ragi puttu from 7 am to 8am.We sell at least 10kg of ragi puttu on Sundays, because it is tasty and nutritious, says Mr.Suresh Kumar. In our soup mixes, the murungai (drumstick) leaf broth is an excellent tonic that can substitute green tea.Spending a week at a workshop on sustainable living conducted by organic farming pioneer G Nammalvar in 2013 convinced G. Sathyabhama to switch over to a more nature-aware lifestyle and set up a shop to sell organic food products.Formerly working in an ancillary unit for a heavy engineering firm, Ms.Sathyabhama found chemical-free food to be the perfect antidote for her chronic ulcer problem.Her Evergreen Organic Store in Srirangam sources groceries like unrefined sugar, cooking oil, wild rice and millets, besides beauty products from nearly 15 suppliers all over the state.She rues the absence of a pricing and quality control body that could standardise the organic food business in Tamil Nadu. Currently, all our organic produce is sent to metro cities like Chennai and Bangalore. The shortage causes a hike in prices locally.Among the heirloom grains in her store are kaattu arisi, a type of wild rice that is harvested from open grounds, and mapillai samba, which is said to increase the haemoglobin count in the blood and also fight cancer.Online and awayE.Gopalakrishnan, a veteran of agriculture-based business, has now shifted to the next level  his Millet.In brand products are sold exclusively on Amazon.com. I realised that setting up retail outlets was not suitable for my kind of stock, because I have to be personally involved in its production, so I decided to concentrate on what I could do best, he says.Going online has freed up time for him to supply bigger retailers of organic products, and also to come up with new ideas from the comfort of his home in Tiruchis Srinivasa Nagar (where he maintains a garden of medicinal plants).It is always healthier to opt for kanji (gruel made by boiling the millet) rather than kool (mushy porridge made by cooking millet flour), according to native medicine, says Mr.Gopalakrishnan. His ready-to-cook kanji mix is among the top sellers of Millet.In.Besides this, he also has a regular clientele for his karsilankanni (Eclipsa Alba) hair oil and mudakattan (Cardiospermum halicacabum or balloon vine) massage oil.

""The central government has been sanctioning funds in the budget to distribute sugar at subsidized rate for poor. While the central sanction was Rs 18 per kg, the states were bearing the remaining cost to purchase sugar from the market and towards commission to fair price shop dealers. However, in the recent annual budget presented by finance minister Arun Jaitley, funds have not been sanctioned for the distribution of sugar to the poor,"" Khader said.In fact, the Karnataka government will have to pay Rs 70 per kg as commission to fair price shops for the distribution of sugar under subsidized rate. This is in addition to the rate difference in the wholesale market price of sugar that is being purchased for the purpose, Khader said, adding that the department supplies one kg of sugar at Rs 15 to BPL families every month through fair price shops.""Many states have raised concern over central government not reserving funds in the Budget. It is an indication that the central government has no plans to continue the scheme that was implemented by previous government. Hence, we have decided to communicate with the finance ministry in this regard and request the central government to continue the sanction,"" Khader said. On distribution of kerosene, Khader said that chief minister Siddaramaiah has agreed to distribute kerosene for ration card holders in rural areas without considering their LPG connection status."

If the trend continued, the farmers would be left with only the leaves of trees and plants to eat, they said at a grievance day meet here on Friday.To highlight their plight, a section of farmers donned an outfit made of leaves and consumed some leaves during a protest staged in front of the officials.Led by the vice-president of All Farmers Coordination Committee Kakkarai Sukumaran, the farmers said the lending institutions must stop adjusting input subsidy against the loan accounts.Already the State government had announced that the entire State had been affected by the drought and surveys completed to assess crop loss.It revealed that the hapless farmers were suffering a lot and had lost more due to spending on agricultural inputs. Having gone through the ordeal, if the officials had to adjust the subsidy against the loan availed, how would the farmers sustain, they wondered.Chairing the meet, Collector A. Annadurai said that of the 1.50-lakh hectare brought under samba and thalady paddy cultivation in Thanjavur district during the current season, more than 87,000 hectares had been affected by drought and they had been listed. All farmers who suffered crop loss of more than 33 % were being listed for compensation and no farmer who had suffered crop loss would be left out, he said.Crop loss survey had been completed in 906 villages in the district and input subsidy amounting to Rs. 105 crore sanctioned to 92,914 farmers. The balance 3,000-odd farmers would be getting the input subsidy shortly, he said.When sugar cane growers alleged that malpractices were going on in a huge scale at the Arignar Anna Cooperative Sugar Mills, Kurungulam, near here, Mr. Annadurai cautioned them that they could not cast aspersions on any official without specific inputs.During the course of the discussions, the farmers entered into a heated argument with the officials and walked out of the meeting to stage a dharna outside the hall."

Pandian from Madurai District Farmers Association told Madurai Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao that it was unfair to supply lakhs of litres of water to these two companies when the entire district was staring at drinking water crisis.Other farmers also joined the demand and urged the Collector to prioritise drinking water requirements over the requirement of the two companies.Mr. Pandian also alleged that the Public Works Department had limitations in ensuring that only the permitted amount of water was being taken by the two companies.Acknowledging the limitations, a PWD official, speaking on anonymity, later told The Hindu that both the companies were pumping water from the dam and PWD could not regulate their intake at the source.The officials can only inspect motor readings maintained by the companies to check how much they had taken, he said.Responding to the farmers at the meeting, PWD officials, however, said that the water provided to the two companies had now been reduced to around 6 lakh litres per day.M. Muthupandian, an Executive Engineer with PWD, said, They were being provided 1.5 cusecs for 24 hours every day (around 36.7 lakh litres per day). It has now been reduced to 0.5 cusecs for just 12 hours a day, he said.He added that further reduction in the supply may force the companies to stop their operations, which will, in turn, affect the livelihood of 1,300 people employed in the two companies.Mr. Rao assured the farmers the situation will be analysed in detail and a decision would be taken appropriately.They were being provided 1.5 cusecs for 24 hours every day (around 36.7 lakh litres per day)M.

""Mahesh Sir"" is Kadam's Dombivli-based positivity guru and Kadam is a 38-year-old personal trainer displaced from his natural habitat five minutes ago. As the glassy gym of a stockholding firm in Navi Mumbai start filling, Kadam sits in the conference room next door. Turning his swivel chair to one side, the bodybuilder puts both his feet up in the air. ""Eighty,"" he says, lifting the right calf. ""Twenty,"" he says, lifting the left. Given his strict diet and workout regime, those figures should have been ""sixty"" and ""forty"", the average strength distribution ratio of a bodybuilder's lower half. But, under his monosyllabic answers and stilted swagger, this two-time Mr India winner hides a lifetime of polio.Kadam was three when his Satara-based parents had dunked him in buckets of hot water to will sensation back into his left leg. At 19, he first felt those virus-weakened muscles shiver. ""I still remember the date. August 16th, 1997,"" says Kadam, about the day he started working out in a Parel gym, after being goaded by his uncle and his brother, a bodybuilding champion. Two years later, Kadam enrolled in the ""open"" category at a district-level bodybuilding championship and went on to win several medals till 2006 after which he took a break from the expensive sport to focus on his career. Today, ten years later, the fitness trainer is ready to drop his pants and don a serial number on his crotch again. ""I want to be Mr World,"" he says. His first step towards that would be to participate in the Indian Bodybuilding Federation's (IBBF) 17th Junior Masters championship in Indore this weekend.He is one of the four physically challenged participants from Maharashtra in the segment, for which over 40 disabled athletes from all over India will congregate for two days. This event where the prize money has grown from Rs 5,000 in 2009 to the present Rs 50,000, speaks to bloating interest in the spectator sport. Not only has the number of bodybuilders with leg impediments from accidents or medical conditions, doubled in eight years but also more organisers are inserting this category in their shows, spawning avenues and cash prizes. For instance, Belgaum's Satish Sugars Classic recently gifted the physically challenged gold medallist Rs 75,000 while Pune's Swayambhu Shree boasted prize money of Rs 1 lakh. In part, this spurt has to do with the lure of international platforms since last year. ""These athletes inspire others with disabilities to take up the sport,"" says Chetan Pat-hare, general secretary, IBBF.While a medal opens up government jobs for regular athletes, the most a disabled champion can hope for is credibility in the fitness space or a resume frill in a private job application. Still, they persist, to find retribution for their weakness. Sion's Inder Rao, 26 recalls doctors dissuading him from working out. ""They said it will permanently damage the structure of the leg,"" says the polio victim. But for Rao, the gym seemed like the only legitimate escape from bullying. Rao avoided socialising and dropped out of engineering college. In 2010, he joined a gym with his father's permission.Inevitably, their fitness journey starts with pain. After an elaborate trial-and-error that saw Rao writhing for the first few days, he evolved a fitness regime that puts minimal pressure on his right leg. ""I do most of my workout in the sitting position,"" says Rao. Today, 11 medals and four certificate courses later, Rao trains ten physically-challenged clients and is now ready for another national contest. The prize money isn't enough to cover the expenses for these musclemen who spend Rs 600 per day on chicken, eggs and multivitamins. However, rewards come in the form of standing ovation and poignant comments. At times, attention from women online, who Rao doesn't indulge. ""They don't seem to like me when they see the full picture,"" he says.Not only has the number of bodybuilders with leg impediments from accidents or medical conditions, doubled in eight years but more organisers are inserting this category in their shows"

Once the desired consistency is attained the hot mixture is poured into moulds and a cotton thread is placed over it, with portions of the thread dipped in syrup. The mixture cools down within minutes and sugar strings are removed and moulds are readied for another lot. The duo hails from Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh and make this trip to the city every year a fortnight before Shivratri.In the local lingo these strings are called gathi and they make an appearance in the market around Holi. ""We make one and a half quintals of these strings every day for which four quintals of sugar is used,"" says Mohd Imran. These strings sell for Rs65 per kg. ""We don't get local workers to prepare them though gathis are used in Shivratri puja, then again they are offered in the Holi fire lit on the eve of the festival and is in demand on Gudi Padwa day also,"" says Pintu Sahu, a wholesaler who calls Imran and his uncle every year to prepare gathi.Shops in the Rewadi Bazaar area of Itwari are loaded with these sugar strings as they are bought in bulk for sales across the city and even in the neighbouring areas up to Madhya Pradesh. ""The sales in the city have been dipping every year but we get buyers from rural areas like Pandurna and other small villages,"" Sahu informs.The gathi strings are presented to elders, newly-weds and young children on Holi to make them feel special. It is more of a social gesture than religious. With a political culture gradually evolving in the region now gathis are painted with edible colours and also decorated with plastic flowers and even mirrors. ""This is a part of the social milieu of this region,"" says Sanjay Gupta the owner of Jaganath stores in Itwari. ""But this has a certain medicinal value too as it prevents heat strokes,"" Gupta says and adds that though the strings can be used for consumption but they cannot be a substitute for sugar as they taste different."

A traditional BJP voter in Agra's Taj Ganj area, this time, Agarwal is facing a dilemma. On the one hand, business has been slower since 'notebandi'. On the other, a new ruling by the Centre governing pharmacies threatens to cripple what's left of his business.This rule mandates that in addition to obtaining a drug licence, drug stores register a licensed pharmacist associated with their stores to remain in business.While drug licences were easy to obtain and cost much less, pharmacists are in short supply and come at a much higher price. In effect, though this decision will weed out spurious drug sellers, it's also forcing people like Agarwal, with small corner stores, out of business.""I've run this pharmacy in Taj Ganj for 16 years. I believe that Modiji is taking decisions in people's best interests. For this, I support him.But in this case, I feel he has not consulted the people who were about to be affected. The big players will survive, but smaller drug stores like mine will become unviable,"" Agarwal said.Saying he has regularly paid his taxes and tried to remain afloat, Agarwal added, ""Hum to Baniya hain, dukaan band hui to cheeni bhi bech lenge...lekin junta ko bahut nuksaan hua hai (I am a Baniya. I will send sugar if not medicines but public will be at a loss).""In the thickly populated tourist zone where businesses thrive because of tourist footfall, demonetisation has served as a silent killer.

He has had no work orders and has made only less than half of what he usually earned--Rs 8,000 a month--since November 2016. Haseen, a marble inlay artist, said, ""Kya karein?

But the fruit in its raw form in Goa is also used to make a refreshing drink known locally as panh or panak, or panna in North India To prepare panh, raw mangoes of a good variety are selected, so that there is enough flesh to extract pulp for the drink. The raw mangoes have to be then washed clean and cooked either in water in a pot, or in a pressure cooker. These cooked mangoes are then cooled and skinned, after which the pulp is then extracted from the seed and the skin.Adding powders of cumin seeds, pepper and crushed cardamom seeds adds deliciousness to the concoction. For the pulp of every two big mangoes, around 250 grams of jaggery helps with the flavours.Grinding all these ingredients into a fine paste and adding water to it, gives a transparent sherbet-like consistency to the mix. With a few cubes of ice or when refrigerated, this drink is a great relief from the summer heat.This drink is also traditionally known to be good to beat dehydration , and is believed to give relief from other heat-related health issues.One can also enjoy panh year round by storing it as a squash for later.To store it, all the collected pulp has to be thinned by adding water and again boiled into a bigger pot by adding salt and jaggery to it, to suit personal tastes. After boiling it for 10 minutes, the concentrated squash as a panh is ready. If stored in an air-tight container, it can be used as per need for a week or fortnight without using any chemical preservatives.There is another method of storage, where one can cool the pulp, add jaggery, and grind the mixture and store it without adding water. This is done by adding pepper powder, crushed cardamom, salt and water at the time of actually having the drink. Refrigeration is the only method to preserve this form of panh.Though jaggery is the traditional and healthier alternative, one can also add jaggery and crystal sugar (instead of adding jaggery alone) in equal parts. This gives an entirely different flavor to the drink."

Once looked down upon as a poor man's food, the fruit, which is now being hailed as the new vegan superfood , is making its way into everything from biryanis to burgers.From the unripe pods to seeds and the ripe fruit, all forms of the bumpy green fruit with a golden heart is making its way to Indian meals. Malayalis use it to make everything from vegetable dishes to payasams, for Bengalis, it is the ""gaach patha"" or ""mutton that grows on the tree"". In the West, the chewy pods are fast becoming a substitute for meat while, in India, people are using it to replace carbohydrates.Jackfruit is high in dietary fibre, is a rich source of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant, and is packed with phytonutrients, which may reduce the risk of many cancers, says Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital.""Vitamin C helps in the absorption of iron,"" she says. The fruit is also a rich source of riboflavin, which helps to heal oral ulcers, and the Vitamin A in it prevents macular degeneration of the eye. ""It is also an important source of magnesium so it further helps in the absorption of calcium, and fights osteoporosis."" It is these health benefits that people abroad are discovering says Regi Mathew, mentor and director of Kappa Chakka Kandhari, a `neo'stalgic gourmet company. Praveen Anand, executive chef at ITC hotels, says it is being used extensively in their hotels. ""In north India, we have kathal (jackfruit) ki biriyani, as well as kormas, and kebabs made of it,"" he says.The fruit is said to be among the top food trends of 2017. ""This January, at the Fancy Food Show in the US, the star ingredient was jackfruit,"" says restaurateur M Mahadevan, adding that it is used as a meat replacer in restaurants in New York and San Francisco.""The young fruit is considered a good replace ment for pulled pork and is served on burgers along with caramelised onion chutney ,"" says Mahadevan. He is planning to stock jackfruit chips and jams in Hot Breads stores there.Entrepreneurs have been quick to spot the marketing potential. Keralite James Joseph gave up a flourishing career with Microsoft to launch Jackfruit365 in 2013. ""I have always wondered why jackfruit doesn't feature on the menu in five-star hotels,"" says Joseph, adding that he realised it was because the fruit was `too sticky, smelly and seasonal'. So he came up with the idea of selling freeze-dried jackfruit.""The ripe fruit can be used to make pies and panna cotta, while the unripe pods can replace meat or tofu,"" says Joseph. After Jackfruit365 became a 100% diabetic diet company , they sell only unripe fruit online. ""The dried, sliced jackfruit can also be powdered and the flour added to idli or dosa batter and phulkas,"" says Joseph.Studies have revealed consumption of unripe jackfruit can help fight high blood sugar level. Bajaj stresses that ripe pods are not good for diabetics. ""The ripe fruit has a glycemic index (GI) of 63, while the unripe pod has a GI of only 52,"" she says.""Since it fills you up it helps cut down on rice and wheat."""

The main reason for this is that they easily fall prey to middlemen and wholesale traders, who often take them for a ride, quoting low prices.That sad story may now come to an end, if the state government has its way .In a first of its kind, the Karnataka Agriculture Pricing Commission has mooted a proposal to enact the Right to Remunerative Prices Act to give statutory powers to its agriculture agencies to initiate legal action against those who buy goods below the minimum support price (MSP).KAPC chair man T N Prakash Kamaraddi said the government, as of now, has no powers to initiate action against anyone who buys crops from farmers for less than the MSP . By giving statutory status to the commission and state agriculture department, he said it can guarantee income security to all farmers of the state. ""Under the proposed law, the government can initiate legal action against traders that includes confiscation of stock, imprisonment, penalty , among other things,'' he added.Impressed by the proposal, he said the government referred it to National Law School, Bengaluru, to seek an expert report before preparing a draft bill. Kamaraddi said the support price will ensure farmers get the actual cost of production for crops.Welcoming the move, Kurbur Shantakumar, state president of the Sugarcane Growers' Association, said it has been one of their long pending demands. Though the government announced MSP for various crops, no traders bought at that price, other than the government agencies.This, he said, was because they knew the government could do nothing if they buy at a lower rate.He cited the example of paddy , where the government announced MSP of Rs 1,500 per quintal. But farmers across the state were forced to sell their produce to private rice millers and traders at much lower rates. ""Many of them ended up selling for Rs 700 to Rs 1,100 per quintal,'' he alleged.As of now, only the Centre has the powers to announce statutory minimum price and fair and remunerative price for sugarcane, and the power to initiate legal action, if they find anyone buying produce for prices less than MSP ."

Petrobras reduced gasoline prices for the second time this year on Feb. 24, citing the stronger real and stable oil prices.The situation further deteriorates the cane-based fuel competitiveness against gasoline. Hydrous ethanol consumption fell 18 percent last year compared to 2015, as drivers switch to gasoline.As a result, mills should again earmark as much cane as possible to sugar production at the expense of ethanol.

Akhilesh inaugurated the Metro only for the sake of elections. Similarly, the Agra-Lucknow expressway is full of diversions and incomplete but was inaugurated for similar reasons. Do villages in UP get electricity for 24 hours? Is clean, drinking water available in villages? Are farmers selling wheat and sugarcane to the government getting paid timely?

Data available with India's National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme show that dengue cases more than doubled between 2014 and 2015; the central agency noted 40,571 cases in 2014 that increased to 99,913 in 2015. While 137 people died in 2014, 220 died in 2015. In 2016, the increasing onslaught of dengue resulted in 1,1,880 cases and 227 deaths.Now, a press release from the Rockefeller University on Wednesday, claims to have nailed why certain people are more vulnerable to dengue than others.Dengue, essentially a viral infection spread by the Aedes egypti mosquitoes, is a relatively mild-mannered disease the first time around. But a second infection by the virus is known to have severe symptoms, including death.""Patients with severe secondary disease have high levels of a particular type of antibody that triggers a forceful immune response. This distinctive signature did not show up in patients with more mild illness,"" said senior author Jeffrey V Ravtech of the Rockefeller University.Their work essentially says that shows how the dengue virus ``co-opts antibodies produced as a result of the previous infection, using them to inflict more damage the second time around.""Among patients with a second dengue infection, patients can develop hemorrhagic fever, which causes them to bleed abnormally from the nose, gums or under the skin. Less than 15 % people who catch dengue for the second time develop such hemorrhagic fever or shock.""Previous work in Ravetch's lab suggested differences in antibodies might account for why only some develop severe secondary infections. These Y-shaped proteins help the body defend itself against viruses and other intruders by latching onto infected cells with their arms,"" said the press release. Their stems, known as Fc regions, bind to immune cells and tell them how to respond. Ravetch's lab has shown that the structure of the Fc region can influence an immune response by, for example, promoting inflammation versus calming it.In the current study, first author Taia Wang took a close look at the Fc regions of antibodies in blood collected from patients at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. They found the dengue patients with more serious disease had high levels of antibodies whose Fc regions lack a particular sugar, a variation known to strongly activate immune cells.""In experiments, the researchers showed that activating signals from these antibodies aggravated the disease by leading to the destruction of blood-clotting cells called platelets. When their platelet levels plummet, patients bleed abnormally-a hallmark of hemorrhagic fever. The lower a patient's platelet count, the more of these distinctive antibodies he or she tended to have,'' added the press release. The discovery of this antibody signature could help fight the disease in a number of ways."

Such a calamity could paralyse the country's southern states this year unless the governments take steps on a war footing to conserve water, warn experts.Conservation through harvesting and recharging groundwater are the lessons waterstarved states teach their drought-affected counterparts even as experts emphasise on discouraging farmers from carrying out cultivation of waterguzzling crops like sugarcane during such challenging times.The depleting water levels in major reservoirs in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have caused concern over the crisis in these states. While several parts in the four states have already been declared `drought-hit', experts have suggested measures to save the available resources for the coming months.Former Central Water Commission (CWC) chairman A B Pandey said states must begin conservat ion of water.""Drought-hit states must calcu late the avail ability of wa ter and start the process of reducing sup ply so that the existing amount lasts till June at least,"" he said. Noting that Latur woke up to the crisis only at the fag end of it because of which things went out of control, he said, ""It is necessary for the drought-affected states to kickstart conservation plans including in farming.""The desert state of Rajasthan has succeeded in implementing conservation of rainwater to meet the requirements during summer. The concept of saving every drop of rainwater is helping to improve the ground water level in a big way , said Sriram Vedire, chairperson of Rajasthan River Basin and Water Resources Planning Authority He told TOI over phone that groundwater recharge structures were created in 295 blocks of the state. ""We carried out multiple recharge measures in different parts of the state, which has varied landscape of deserts and plains. Concrete structures were constructed beneath the surface in desert areas to allow the water to percolate deep into the ground,"" he said, adding that 50 blocks had been removed from the red zones of water scarcity after the programme was launched in 2015.Pointing out that the Rajasthan model could be emulated elsewhere, Vedire, who is also the advisor to the Union water resource ministry, said it was the need of the hour in southern states facing drought."

After rallying to a 4-year high in September, benchmark ICE white sugar futures have slumped more than 17 percent, touching their weakest in over 9 months last week.""We are bound to see price volatility but that's something we face in other crops as well. This is part of a farmer's job these days. It's up to us to find ways of withstanding it,"" said Alexandre Pele, whose family has grown sugar beet on a farm 60km south of Paris for more than a century.EU farmers say they are now ready to compete globally after the sector was thoroughly restructured, following a 2005 ruling by the World Trade Organization that the EU unfairly subsidised its sugar producers, which led to a sharp cutback of exports.For the past decade, Brussels took steps to limit the crop with quotas, while guaranteeing a floor price for farmers. The EU went from exporting nearly a third of its sugar crop to becoming a net importer, under a regime now set to be dismantled in October.For their first season of free trade, farmers have so far been offered contracts with a good rate of return, by cooperatives and other buyers that want to encourage planting to build up a surplus for export.Pele, who sells through Cristal Union, one of France's main sugar beet buying cooperatives, plans to increase his planting area by around 10 percent this year.""We have certain strengths in France after the restructuring of the sugar industry in 2006, so I think we're ready for the world market,"" he said.French sugar cooperative Tereos, which says it collects more than 40 percent of the French crop, expects to boost output by 25 percent. The group said it signed contracts to buy 19 million tonnes of beet from its members in 2017/18, up from 15 million.Sowings have also begun for the next season in the EU's number two grower, Germany, where there could be ""double-digit"" growth in the planted area, said Guenter Tissen, CEO of industry association WVZ.Sugar beet sowings are set to climb by one-third in Britain, although this partly represents a rebound after a bumper crop in 2014/2015 forced farmers to scale back planting.Under their new contract with processing company British Sugar, farmers will receive a minimum price for their beet, as well as a bonus amount if world sugar prices climb.""We have for the first time a sugar beet contract in the UK that does begin to reflect an element of market return,"" said William Martin, who plans to sow 220 acres of sugar beet in his Cambridgeshire farm this year.However, Britain will remain a net importer in the short-term and output in the long term could depend on trade deals struck with major sugar cane producers like Brazil following last year's UK vote to leave the European Union.SWEET OPPORTUNITYWhile sugar yields depend on weather, an initial estimate from Green Pool pegs EU production for 2017/2018 at 18.3 million tonnes in white sugar value, with exports of 3.4 million tonnes.Platts is forecasting total production for that season at 19.27 million tonnes, with exports estimated at 2.4 million tonnes. By comparison, the European Commission forecasts production at 16.6 million tonnes in the previous 2016/2017 season now coming to a close.In the 2005/2006 season, before output was curbed, the EU produced 18.9 million tonnes and exported 7.4 million tonnes, International Sugar Organization figures show.Sugar beet is used to produce 20 percent of the world's sugar. While sugar cane is usually cheaper as a raw material for refineries, white sugar from beets can be competitive in international trade when total costs are factored in.The EU's return to the global stage is likely to intensify competition in its historically traditional export markets in the Middle East and North Africa, increasingly supplied by cane sugar processed in Dubai, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.Central and South Asia could also offer attractive markets for EU exports, although the bloc could run into competition from other emerging exporters like Ukraine and Russia.Even with the surge in output, the bloc's aim to re-emerge as a major exporter could be dampened in the short term by dwindling domestic EU sugar stocks, which are poised to fall by more than 50 percent in the current season.Worries over domestic supplies deepened this month when the EU approved an additional 700,000 tonnes of out-of-quota sugar for export in the 2016/2017 year.""I think there is that drive to export and to stake your claim in the export market,"" said Erin Burns, senior EU sugar analyst at Platts. ""But, until the end of September, the domestic stock situation looks very tight. So what we could see is exports only happening if stocks get to a comfortable level.""(Additional reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide, Valerie Parent and Michael Hogan; Editing by Veronica Brown and Peter Graff)"

For refiners in the United States, it is a bonus: they have in their own backyard a ready market for rising fuel exports.Overall, the 30 nations in the region bought 2.32 million barrels per day (bpd) of diesel, gasoline and other fuels last year from the United States, up 67 percent from 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demands for United States imports are rising in the region's biggest economies, up 199,000 bpd or 29 percent last year in Mexico and 75,000 bpd or 94 percent in Brazil, contributing to the gains.""We need to build joint ventures to find the capital the refineries require,"" said the head of Mexico's oil regulator, Juan Carlos Zepeda, referring to his own country. ""And we need to produce more gas,"" he added in comments earlier this month.But getting there will take time and in Mexico, energy reform is likely to lead to more imports as the retail market is liberalized, before upstream reforms can boost domestic production.Cheaper fuel prices have made it easier for these countries to buy in recent years. Latin America's bill for fuel imports from the United States fell to about $47 billion last year from $51 billion in 2015.GROWING DEMANDBut if last year's imports were measured at 2012's peak prices, the fuels' tab would have been twice as large. Any spike in oil prices would hit countries hard, given the increased volumes they need.""With demand increasing and a stable refining capacity, the region's import needs will continue to grow,"" said Jake Fuller, a senior analyst at consultants IHS Markit.American refiners along the Gulf Coast are well-placed to continue supplying the region. In contrast, Latin America's state-controlled refinery firms have little capital or outside investment interest in expansions or overhauls, Fuller said.As fuel imports rise, crude shipments from the region's energy producers are falling. Latin America exported 5.2 million bpd in 2016, according to Reuters Trade Flows figures. The United States buys just under half of the region's crude exports.Reforms that encourage producers to bring capital to oilfields are under way in Mexico and Argentina. ""We are in the right path,"" said Miguel Gutierrez, president of Argentina's state-run YPF SA, when asked about political change in his country earlier this month.REFINERIES WANTEDAnalysts offer a simple fix for Latin America's dependence on fuel imports: build more refineries and halt the subsidies that push up demand. Political realities often collide with such remedies, however.In Ecuador, Venezuela and some Caribbean nations, heavy consumer subsidies have stymied efforts to attract outside investment.Mexico this year raised prices on gasoline by up to 20 percent in a move that caused public protests.""We made this very unpopular move to increase prices.

But what happened overnight that these sworn political enemies are now locked in a friendly embrace? Those who cannot save themselves, how will they save UP?""Modi also attacked the opposition over surgical strikes. ""There is a government at the Centre who knows how to live and die for our soldiers who are protecting our borders. There was a time when the enemy used to sneak into our territory at night and kill our soldiers. Our soldiers could not retaliate even armed with weapons because they never had permission. We gave a befitting reply to Pakistan through surgical strikes and look at our leaders who question the authenticity of those strikes. They are doing politics over our soldiers.""Significantly, Modi said that while people faced incovenience after demonetisation, now it was the hoarders of black money and the corrupt who were facing trouble.

The court observed that though Koshti was apprised of her rights on how a search was to be conducted under Section 50 of the NDPS Act, the cop did not mention that she would be searched in the presence of a magistrate. The court said from the constable's statement it was revealed that he had only mentioned a gazetted officer. ""These serious lacunas in the prosecution case give benefit of doubt to the accused,"" the court said. It also held that the woman constable who had conducted the personal search on Koshti did not even depose as a prosecution witness.In the second case, Rani Gaikwad (50) was nabbed for allegedly dealing in brown sugar from her Masjid Bunder home in 2009. In this case too, the court observed that she had not been appraised of her rights under Section 50. The court also found that besides a female constable, even a male sub-inspector conducted her personal search ""It is necessary to take personal search of the accused in a closed room by keeping her decency... provision of Section 50(4) has not been complied,"" the court said.In the third case, in March, a court acquitted a Malwani man who was arrested in 2012 for possessing 1.1kg of charas.

The rescue operation which had begun at 9.45am ended at 4.30pm.Early Thursday morning, villagers of Veppalampatti heard the anguished cries of a herd of wild elephants. Following the sounds, they saw the herd surrounding a bore well on a piece of land owned by Roja, wife of a local farmer. By the time the sun came up, the herd had disappeared into the Durgam Reserved Forest, although villagers could still hear them trumpeting.Seeing the area cleared, the villagers peaked into the well and found a lone elephant. ""They informed the forest department at around 8am, after which we immediately dispatched rangers to the spot,"" said one ranger. By 9am they figured that the well was too deep to break down the walls.After careful assessment of the situation, the officials decided to dig another deep hole next to the bore well and create a tunnel between the two pits, allowing the elephant to walk out through the tunnel.""Two earth movers were brought in to get the job done but progress was slow. By afternoon, a giant earth mover was brought in to speed up the task,"" said a press statement from the animal husbandry department.The fallen elephant, which had been crying out for help, finally lay down with exhaustion. The forest department immediately dropped sticks of sugar cane into the pit. They also dropped down buckets of water mixed with jaggery which the animal drank. Once the elephant seemed to have regained some of its energy, the officials brought in thousands of litres of water in two tractors, which they doused the elephant with to keep it hydrated and cool.At 4.30pm, when the pit and tunnel were completed, the animal crawled out through the tunnel. The minute the elephant came out, it panicked and ran for its life across the Veppalampatti railway track and into the Durgam Forest. Animal husbandry minister, Balakrishna Reddy also arrived at the spot in the afternoon to oversee operations.Meanwhile, Roja, the owner of the bore well, was upset that her bore well was damaged. However, the forest and animal husbandry department assured her that through government schemes, she would be able to install drip-irrigation system free of cost."

In 2013, 745 farmers took their lives in UP .Bundelkhand, already facing drought-like conditions, witnessed large-scale migrations last year. Last March, 24 deaths were reported from just one district -Jalaun. These were shown as ""normal"" in official records. This grim picture in UP's food belt may force tillers to think differently while voting this time around.This vast tract is getting angrier by the day. In fertile west UP, where sugarcane is grown on 70% of cultivable land, farmers dominate the electorate, up to 75% in pockets of Baghpat and Bijnor. Sugarcane supports almost 5 million farmers, generates over Rs 30,000 crore annually through production of sugar, ethanol, spirits, power and gur.Prof RK Juyal, who teaches economics at Meerut's NAS PG College and a farm sector expert, says: ""The caste factor is predominant among west UP's farmers too. But their never-ending ordeal seems to be blurring the fault lines.They might end up voting as farmers, not as Jats, Gujjars or Dalits."" Juyal may have a point.Here's why: C Showing his 25kg sack of cauliflower, Chetram Kashyap, 42, a Kairana farmer who grows seasonal vegetables on his four bighas, says: ""This will sell locally for Rs 70, of which Rs 20 will go to transporters. The crop is good, where are the returns? Thanks to demonetisation. Farmers must unite. Only then will politicians hear us.""Agriculture's share in UP's GDP has slipped. Sugarcane, a mainstay, is in trouble. Prices have been unstable, farmers' dues are pending -which factories have to pay farmers.Sugarcane farmers are miffed with politicians quoting ""misleading figures"" on their dues to buttress achievement claims. Ram Kumar, from Deoband, Saharanpur, remembers: ""The PM was here last May and claimed we've got cane dues, which is far from true.""On May 28, 2016, addressing a Saharanpur rally, Narendra Modi claimed that cane grow ers' dues had reduced under his government's watch, to Rs 700 crore to Rs 800 crore from Rs 14,000 crore. Records from the cane commissioner's of fice in Lucknow say the dues stood at Rs 5,795 crore the day the PM spoke.Major parties began efforts to harness this farmer discon tent much ahead of the polls. Rahul Gandhi undertook a 2,500-km `Deo ria-to-Dilli' kisan yatra last September, held khat sabhas, promised loan waivers and power tariff reduction by 50%.In its manifesto, BJP 's prom ised to cancel loans of small and marginal farmers, and ad ditional loans at 0% interest.Then came demonetisation.Its timing, when kharif was ready for harvest and rabi to be sowed, was bad. Many couldn't harvest on time due to the cash crunch, labour ers couldn't be paid; many others couldn't sow, there was no money for seeds.""We went with Modi-BJP in 2014,"" says Mritunjay Singh of Meerut. ""Bad years followed. Notebandi hit us hard. When we gather to discuss polls, we gather as farmers. I hope we vote for the party that can address our grievances."""

Obesity in turn could lead to cardiovascular disease, thyroid, diabetes, sleep apnea etc., Dr. Ugale said.He said an early surgical treatment could return the life of diabetic patients to normalcy and help reduce other complications.Ileal interposition, sleeve with loop bipartition are two surgeries for diabetes. Ileal interposition is a kind of exchange of initial and final parts of the small intestine for type two diabetes. He said that the insulin resistance hormones were excreted from the initial parts of the digestive system and the insulin sensitivity hormone called GLP-1 was released from the L cells in the last part of the intestine.Dr. Ugale said GLP-1 was a hormone that increased the effects of insulin and stimulated insulin production by the pancreas.The goal of the procedure was to leave the resistance hormones aside and increase the sensitivity hormones.He said diabetics with or without obesity could now get rid of increased sugar levels with a single surgery."

Back home, I miss the greenery of the campus, the friendly and ever-helping professors and friends, intellectual discussions near the library, the umpteen number of chais and the lovely beaches.Dr. Lencho had done his PhD at the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication in AU and been part of the campus from 2007 to 2011.He is here to promote his country and sign MoUs with Indian institutions for bilateral cooperation through exchange programmes.Centre for African studiesAs part of that we are signing an MoU with AU to develop a centre for African studies, he informed The Hindu .Talking about the similarities between Ethiopia and India, he said, Ethiopia is a young democracy, just 20 years old. But there are a many striking similarities between India and my country. In Ethiopia, there are about 80 languages and each has a separate ethnic personality and in that diversity there is unity, a trait very similar to India.After finishing his PhD, he moved back to Ethiopia to take up teaching at Addis Ababa University, before turning to politics. On why he chose politics, he said, I had an inclination towards politics since my teenage days and was active in campus movement. I realised that I have to give back something to my country and hence took up politics, as my country is a young and growing democracy and it needs me. For me politics is something beyond earnings. I have not taken up politics to earn money. I have taken it up to develop my country.According to him, there are about 540 Indian investors right now in Ethiopia and they are investing in various fields ranging from sugar industry to horticulture and from mining to agriculture.

But the Minister of State for Fisheries, Youth Services and Sports, Pramod Madhwaraj was upset by this because of public protests and hence, it had resulted in his transfer, he said.If you do not take action, they say he is inefficient, if you take action, they are bothered about their public image.
