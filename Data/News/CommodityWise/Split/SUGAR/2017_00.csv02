""After contracting the virus, their health condition deteriorates fast and they often suffer from pneumonia,"" he said.Pointing out that it was a seasonal flu, Kolandaisamy said the H1N1 virus, like all other virus, keeps its strains changing or mutating every year. ""This year, it is more virulent especially in people above 40,"" he said.People contracted with the H1N1 virus first shows symptoms of sore throat and fever, which soon escalate into severe pneumonia in hardly three days. The case was same in patients without other complications.""However, the positive part of the virus mutating is that this season it is not affecting pregnant women unlike in 2009-'10 when many women in Kerala died of the flu,"" he said.The city government hospital alone has so far reported seven deaths due to H1N1 virus. The public health department, however, insisted that there have been only three deaths due to the flu.Speaking at a H1N1 virus prevention camp organised at PSG Tech, Dr Kolandaisamy said, ""There have been only three deaths in Coimbatore and Tirupur due to H1N1 virus. The other deaths were due to comorbid conditions such as renal failure and uncontrolled sugar, but the patients may have also tested for the flu.""The public health department director admitted that around two to three people have been testing positive for the virus every day since December-end.

58f559a17be9e01a3579ecf3,Heated debate in assembly over shortage of ration,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/heated-debate-in-assembly-over-shortage-in-ration/articleshow/57744327.cms,2017-03-21,"CHENNAI: The assembly on Monday witnessed a heated debate over shortage of essential items in the public distribution system (PDS). The main opposition DMK alleged that the state failed to supply essential commodities like dal and palm oil under special PDS for the past three months, despite its claims that it has allocated Rs 5,500 crore annually towards food subsidy.The DMK held statewide protests charging the state government with non-performance in PDS recently, leading to large-scale detention of cadres and leaders. Participating in the budget debate, Krishnagiri MLA T Senguttuvan said the crisis was huge in the Cauvery delta region, where the agriculture sector was already experiencing distress. ""There will be an additional burden of Rs 684 crore if the Centre's subsidy for sugar is stopped from April. Are you then going to shut down the PDS outlets?"" the MLA demanded to know, adding that the supply of foodgrain by the previous DMK regime went off without a hitch.Reiterating the government's commitment to continue universal PDS, and the special PDS for which tenders had been floated recently, food minister R Kamaraj intervened to say that there was a hitch in the supply when O Panneerselvam was chief minister.""There was a delay in the process of extending special PDS after its term ended in December,"" the minister said, setting off heated exchanges. The DMK MLA reminded the minister that he headed the food ministry even during OPS tenure. ""The state's reversal of stand on the National Food Security Act, when Jayalalithaa was hospitalised, will lead to additional financial burden of Rs 2,500 crore,"" Senguttuvan said.Energy minister P Thangamani said the state did not oppose NFSA, but endorsed the scheme after concerns raised by the state were acceded to. In its communication to the state government in October 2016, the Union government said no further allocation of food grain would be made to the state under APL and BPL category."

The prices are now Rs. 37-Rs. 38 a kg.The Centre should not permit imports of sugar this year (October 2016-September 2017) as output may outstrip demand, said Palani G. Periasamy, president of South Indian Sugar Mills Association.The current season started with an opening stock of 7.7 million tonnes and the production this year is expected to be 20.3 million tonnes. The total sugar consumption will be about 24 million tonnes and the closing stock for the current season is estimated to be four million tonnes.Though production has been hit in south Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu because of drought, it is expected to be high in Uttar Pradesh this year.Mr. Periasamy said the domestic industry was reviving after three years of a sharp drop in prices, the demand has stabilised, and the current demand-supply position is expected to be comfortable.The industry is just recovering and we should not disturb it. Should there be a need for imports, it can be reviewed after a couple of months. But, we estimate there will not be a need for it. If we import, the market sentiment will push down the domestic prices and local mills will not be able to download the stocks, he said.Production in Uttar Pradesh this year was initially estimated to be 8.3 million tonnes. But it might go up to 9.5 million tonnes. This season we expect bumper production in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Periasamy said.Usually, sugar produced in the south is supplied to the northern States too. But, this year, with production affected in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, supply to north India might not be there.But, there will be no shortage, Mr. Periasamy said. Further, sowing is said to be good in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Hence, sugar arrivals will start early next season.The current season began with ex-gate prices hovering around Rs. 27 a kg and the prices now are Rs. 37-Rs. 38 a kg. Any price increase in the future will be moderate and even if it goes up, it will be less than the international prices, he said. The production cost was Rs. 36.50 a kg."
58f55b03a3d24b0b70c205a1,Of ‘Bahubalis’ in the political arena,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/of-bahubalis-in-the-political-arena/article17670405.ece,2017-03-27,"As it is set to hit the silver screens shortly, the sequel of the Tollywood blockbuster Bahubali , which created records within the country and abroad in terms of collections, has become a hot topic, at least in the political circles here.Leaders of different political parties are comparing their respective leaders with the super macho character Bahubali, claiming their opponents are no match to their Bahubalis. The Congress was first off the block to claim it had many Bahubalis in its ranks including its State president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and legislature party leader K. Jana Reddy. The TRS leaders on their part allude the character of Bahubali, the righteous, to their president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.Then there is a section of politicos that asserts that there is no question of any Bahubalis in the political spectrum. But, CPI (M) State secretary T. Veerabhadram maintained that the agenda of Bahubali in the State was social justice and this was corroborated by the support received from intelligentsia and other sections to the 4,140 km padayatra by him which concluded recently The ongoing debate assumes significance as the TRS is set to complete its three-year tenure in a couple of months and this marks setting in of the so called election fever in the State.Both CMs sound optimisticThat the election fever has caught up with leaders is evident from both the Chief Ministers of the Telugu States K. Chandrasekhar Rao and N. Chandrababu Naidu forecasting good tidings for their parties at the polls due in 2019.While KCR has predicted that TRS will win 101 out of 119 Assembly constituencies and 15 out of 17 Parliamentary constituencies, his AP counterpart Mr. Naidu says the TDP will win all 175 Assembly seats if the number of seats remained unchanged and all 225 seats if the number was revised. Also, both CMs have waxed eloquent that their respective States registered the highest growth rate in the country. Mr. Rao said the growth rate of Telangana this year was likely to touch 13.7% at current prices. Mr. Naidu maintained that AP was the only State in the country which registered double digit growth continuously for past three years.Counselling tobe restrictedKaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences has proposed reducing the number of counselling phases to prevent prospective PG medicos from trying to slide to the next phase at every attempt, not happy with the specialisation that they were offered, and thereby blocking seats. The university has made the proposal to the State government. In the multiple phases of counselling under the State quota, the university has noticed that many prospective candidates often exercised multiple choices across specialities and may not settle for any of them ultimately.In these circumstances, the university proposed to restrict the number of appearances for counselling at three. If they failed to settle at any of the options at the end of the third counselling, they would be barred from appearing for future counselling sessions.An interesting parallel!Minister for Agriculture Pocharam Srinivas Reddy has drawn an interesting parallel on the existing practice of soil testing. During a debate in Assembly recently, the Minister remarked that the present practice of issuing soil health cards was unscientific as one soil sample is collected from 10 hectares of agricultural land in the case of dry land and from 2.5 hectares of wet land, even if the holdings belong to different farmers. How can the blood sample of Pocharam Srinivas Reddy reveal health problems of neighbouring legislators? It only tells whether I have blood pressure, blood sugar or some other problem, the Minister said, adding that collection of one soil sample from 25 acres of land (dry) will not reveal the real problem and it wont help any of the farmers in that land. Instead, it should be done field (plot) wise so that the agriculture officers could give exact remedy.(M. Rajeev, N. Rahul, Rohit P.S. and B. Chandrashekhar)"

Thirty-six people were killed by wild animals in the Nilgiris in 2015-16. Forest officials attribute it to the change in land use pattern and crop cultivation close to reserve forest areas. Besides, despite being cautioned, local people mindlessly venture into forest lands.The past two years witnessed 18 human deaths each in the Nilgiris. In 2014, the total number of cases reported were 12.Most of the deaths in the past two years were due to elephant attacks, that too in private lands where the animals had strayed into. Activists say the government should seriously consider taking long term measures to prevent such deaths.""The main reason for the conflict is human pressure. And in many cases people living in the fringe areas mindlessly venture into forest areas in the early hours of a day and fall victim,"" Kalanidhi, district forest officer (Nilgiris north division), told TOI. He did not deny animal pressure on people living in the fringe areas of the forests.With the animal and human population growing, conflict arises when resources are shared, according to Kalanidhi. ""Of course, the animal population is increasing, but is sustainable. As far as humans are concerned, their land use pattern and change in crops attract wild animals widely,"" he said, adding, ""To curb the intensity of the conflict we are initiating all possible measures wherever necessary.""Also, fragmentation of undeveloped lands in recent times is another cause of the conflict. Attracted by banana, sugarcane, paddy and coconut cultivations in the fringe areas of forest, elephants intrude into the areas looking for fodder and in the process destroy the fields also.Apparently, the population of elephants and gaurs has increased in the Nilgiri forest areas. Increase in human population exerts much pressure on the animals in the fringe areas.In the past two months this year, two deaths were reported; one due to elephant attack and another in an attack by an Indian gaur.The Gudalur division of forests in the Nilgiris saw 10 victims to man-animal conflict in 2015 while the number surged to 13 in 2016.According to P K Dileep, district forest officer (Gudalur division), with the Janmam Act and the TNPFP Act, the division is very complex in nature. The Gudalur division of forests houses the most number of elephants in the Nilgiris.""We are maintaining a constant vigil in the division and an early warning system is in place,"" Dileep told TOI. In association with an NGO, Shola Trust, the forest department has been conducting a study in the Gudalur forest division on how the conflicts could be brought down. ""The study is yet to be completed. Based on its outcome, control measures could be enhanced accordingly. As of now, we have erected caution boards in sensitive areas,"" Dileep added.K Kalidasan, president, OSAI, told TOI, ""It is a matter of grave concern that 18 human deaths were reported in a year in the Nilgiris due to man-animal conflict. The situation should be thoroughtly analysed. Most of the tribal communities live inside forest areas. But they don't seem to fall prey to animals as they know how to live in harmony in the wild. It is the people who live in the fringe areas who fall prey due to lack of awareness.""According to Kalidasan, as far as the Gudalur area is concerned, most of the corridor lands are either encroached or they fall under section 17 of the Janmam Land Act where tea estates or farming lands are located. ""Repeated chasing of elephants by local people in the Gudalur area is a provocation. That is why the elephants resort to attacks,"" he said.Only joint efforts by the forest department, local bodies, municipalities, private tea estates and TANTEA can curtail the conflicts, he said."

And food takes centre stage in all such diseases.Eating habits have changed a lot over the last two decades. Traditional foods, though trying to make a come back through certain promotional avenues, are largely categorised as foods for the weekends that require more time in the kitchen. Eating out and eating from packets are perhaps the daily norm. And this has certainly taken a toll on the peoples health.What is missed out when the people go in for packed foods are the minerals and nutrients available naturally in foods cooked at home and found aplenty in raw vegetables and fruits. It is a combination of nutrition from a variety of natural foods that helps keep balance in the diets.Pottassium, magnesium, vitamins and other micro-nutrients are found in a number of colourful vegetables and fruits. These help the body metabolism running in the right manner. Including fibrous foods in the diet helps the body to weed out unwanted matter too. An imbalance in the intake starts affecting a body in the long run. It is not just the blood pressure or the sugar levels that gets affected, the imbalances affect the whole body. Every cell in the body gets affected, be it in bones, muscles or any part of the body. The general metabolism happening in the cells is much dependent on many such small inputs that the body gets naturally.And, protection from cancer is to stop that one cell that has the capacity to become cancerous. It is not possible to do that always, but creating an environment for the cells to fight is an important aspect.It is here that preventing unhealthy lifestyles become important , says Dr. Ushashree Warrier, radiation oncologist, Cochin Cancer Research Centre. Informed dietary changes are protective steps.Daily exercise is a habit to be adopted while smoking and alcohol habits are to be shed.Since cancer continues to be a bad word in the society and the treatments continue to drain the people, physically, mentally and financially, the onus is on the people to take the first preventive steps. Though it is an era of information explosion, there is much misinformation too that is spreading around about cancer and other diseases.The hereditary possibility of lifestyle diseases like cancer is an important factor, but that contributes only 10% of the chances, says Dr. Warrier.It could be sometimes a nagging cough or it could be a change in urine patten or the bowel moments or an unexplained abdominal ache.But if these do not get better even after going through any mode of treatment for two weeks or at the most a month, it certainly requires an expert advise.The idea is to screen for precancerous lesions in asymptomatic person who stand chance of developing the disease, says Dr. Warrier.Changes in the skin texture or colour in breast like lumps or growth may or may not be cancerous. But the best thing about advanced technology and early detection of cancer is that the battles are generally won with a rate of over 90% cure.Shyama Rajagopal"

""Innocents in jail will be released after scrutiny,"" she added as the gathering clapped.The BSP has traditionally never released a manifesto for any of the elections it has fought. In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati had dis missed manifestos of other parties as ""nothing but tall claims"", saying her party believed in doing ""real development work"" instead for the people. This year, however, the party had taken to social media to highlight the points they would be focusing on in the 2017 UP elections. As usual, they hadn't released a party manifesto though.Dubbing the BJP ""anti-Dalits"", Mayawati warned people that the Union government would discontinue reservation for SCs and STs. Addressing an election rally in Aligarh, she claimed that she had ""information"" that the Union government was contemplating ending reservations. She said a vote for BJP in UP would be a vote to end reservations. For good measure, she asked Muslims to stay away from the Congress-SP alliance.Alluding to the law and order situation in UP, which BJP, too, is talking about in its rallies, Mayawati said, ""BSP will start a special drive for victims who could not file FIRs during the SP rule in UP. Fresh FIRs will be filed if it is voted to power. Not just this, all innocents who have been framed and sent to jail will be released after proper scrutiny. People in UP live under constant fear as goondas rule the roost,"" she said.Doling out sops for farmers and students, she said, ""Not only all pending dues of sugarcane farmers will be cleared, Rs 1 lakh worth of loans of farmers, poor and labourers will be waived off and paid by my government. We will jail those who have illegally occupied land given to farmers on lease.""The BSP chief said that in place of SP's ""ghatiya"" (bad) mid-day meal, her government will provide cake, milk, biscuits and fruits to students. ""The quality of food being provided will be taken care of.""Repeating her previous promise, Mayawati said she will ensure cash is given to the poor according to their needs ""and not laptops and cellphones that other parties are promising"". The former chief minister, who has been criticised for the statues of elephants - her party symbol - that she put up in Lucknow and other parts of UP, said no such statues would be constructed ""as that work has already been done"".Raising the exodus issue, Mayawati slammed both the SP-Congress combine and BJP. ""The biggest exodus was during the Congress rule when after Independence the maximum number of people left UP in search of employment. In SP rule, people migrated from UP due to bad law and order situation. And with BJP at the centre, many were forced to go out in search of jobs to save their demonetisation-hit, starving families."""

COCOA * May New York cocoa settled up $31, or 1.6 percent, at $2,026 per tonne. * May London settled up 21 pounds, or 1.3 percent, at 1,630 pounds per tonne. * Support came from clarity regarding a wave of defaults in top grower Ivory Coast, after authorities said the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) had auctioned off around 350,000 tonnes of cocoa from defaulted contracts and excess production. * A wave of defaults by exporters who wrongly speculated that world prices would continue to rise has created a cocoa glut, with local farmers unable to find buyers for their beans. * Dealers said the news triggered some short covering and profit taking, since it signaled that the majority of reselling has potentially already been done. * However, one dealer noted gains are limited by ample supplies and an enduring bearish outlook. * ""It may have been helpful to clarify the muddy waters,"" he said.

With this, King Momo , the mythical king of carnivals, will declare the year's four-day carnival celebrations open on February 25. Oh, what one would give, just to head to Goa and partake in the customary grand colourful parade at Panaji, along the Mandovi river! If that ain't happening, the Goan community settled here in Pune, has a celebration of equal pomp on the cards, if not more. And the best part is, you're invited!Festoons adorn the courtyard of the 113-odd-year-old Poona Goan Institute (PGI) at Rasta Peth. Here's where the city's Goan community will meet for a weekend of fun and frolic. Back in Goa, the grand parade is led by King Momo, atop a float with his queen and entourage of subjects. Jesters, dancers, fire eaters and revellers join in the jamboree.Clint D'Souza, honorary general secretary of PGI, promises that the celebrations here will call to mind memories of home. ""There's a food festival to partake in on Saturday, where one can sample Goan traditionals (sorpotel, sannas, and the likes). Musician Denver Mascarenhas will provide us with some foot-tapping music too.""On Sunday, King Momo and his entourage will declare the carnival party open. Goa Tourism might have selected musician Roque Tome Fernandes to essay King Momo this time, but PGI will have its own king. The parade is one that's fresh out of Mario Miranda's caricatures. ""It features people you see in everyday Goa  a fisher woman, a paowalla, and a padri (priest), among others,"" says Clint, adding that it is also customary for King Momo to choose his wife from the crowd.What good is the celebration, if we don't talk about the fare? City food blogger Hilda Mascarenhas, who specialises in Goan cuisine, says, ""Back then, when fewer people attended the parade, one had the luxury of enjoying their sorpotel, vindaloo and chourico (sausage) pulao by the wayside. But with large crowds now, people prefer finger foods."" The Goans love their meat, so there's a plethora of snacks, like prawn rissoles, mackerelcroquetas and mince potato chops, one can relish off roadside stalls.But no Goenkar can do without chourico pao (pao stuffed with pork sausages). ""Made with spices, smoked and dried, it can be prepared in various ways, either a dry chilly fry, or a thick gravy, to be enjoyed with Goan pao,"" Hilda adds.The last day of the festivities, Pancake (or Shrove) Tuesday, sees the community preparing 'alle belle', melt-in-the-mouth pancakes with a sweet stuffing of Goan 'pyramid' palm jaggery and freshly grated coconut. Hilda says, ""These are enjoyed with tea throughout the year, but Pancake Tuesday is when we use all the remaining home supply of eggs, sugar and milk to make these, before the onset of Lent, a period of prayer and abstinence."""

Pushed to the brink, 38-year-old Ravi Kethavath, a farmer from Medak district took up a job in Saudi Arabia for making quick money. Two and half months ago, he died in a road accident in Riyadh . While his family is in mourning, Ravi's body will arrive in Hyderabad on Monday, en route to his native village in Medak.""He had 2-lakh debt to clear and went to Saudi to earn. But, he failed to send money home after being conned by employers. And tragedy struck on December 31, 2016, when he was knocked down by a car and died on the spot,"" said Ravi's elder brother, Sakru Naik, on Sunday. There would not have been any reason for Ravi to go to Saudi. He cultivated sugarcane in his three-acre field in Kamaram village of Shankarampet in Medak district. Wells had gone dry and he had no water for irrigation. Kethavath sunk three bore wells, which also failed. That cost him huge money.An acquaintance took him to Saudi Arabia on a tourist visa, which was valid for a month till April 2016. He took up work as a construction labourer, overstaying illegally. For the months he worked, he did not get paid. When he died, sending his coffin home was difficult. Sakru Naik said they approached many politicians, but got no help.""The Indian embassy in Riyadh helped the family and tried not to burden them with expenses of transporting the body to India,"" said social worker and BJP leader T R Sriniwas of Hyderabad. Considering the economic condition of the family, Sriniwas moved the embassy and sought help.""There were other problems in getting the body back to India. Since he was an illegal immigrant, Saudi laws are specific that the sponsor or employer should produce a letter. Since Ravi Kethavath was illegally employed, the contractor refused to acknowledge he had employed him,"" said Sriniwas.A lawyer, Rakesh, known to Ravi Kethavath's family, brother Sakru Naik, and brother-in-law Bilya Naik got the documentation done to enable the Indian embassy in Riyadh to complete formalities of identifying Ravi's body.Some people offered services to Ravi's family said they could send body home if 10,000 Saudi Riyals ( 1.77 lakh) was paid. Others sought to fleece them of 50,000 to 1 lakh. However, the Indian embassy in Riyadh helped out the family. Hiss last rites will be performed in his native village on Monday."

Lack of water, drought and other climatic issues have reduced the overall yield of sugarcane, which led to the drop in sugar production.""He said efforts are needed to increase yield per acre. New varieties of sugarcanes that consume less water and produce more sugar should be developed, he suggested.Pawar said, the state had produced around 100 lakh tonne sugar on an average in the last couple of years. This has gone down to nearly 45 lakh tonne this year. ""The state currently has 70 big loss-making mills, which incurred a total loss of nearly Rs 2,400 crore this year. Last year there were 40 loss-making units, accounting for Rs 1,200 crore loss,"" he said. He pointed out that poor demand for by-products has added to the worries.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, the state government will sign contracts with sugar mills in the state to purchase power generated by them and offer them higher rates. The sugar mills should come out with innovative technologies to generate more electricity with less financial burden, he said.Fadnavis said sugar mills need to be better managed and more transparent in management.

But we take care of donkeys in Gujarat in the manner we take care of lions,"" the PM said addressing an election rally in Bahraich, north-central UP.""We could learn from the donkey as it obeys its master and complete its task even when tired, hungry or ill, and irrespective of heat, cold or rain. It doesn't matter how heavy the load is. I've taken inspiration from the donkey. My master are the 1.25 crore countrymen and I will work tirelessly 24 hours without taking a holiday for my master,"" Modi said.The PM repeated the remarks at another rally in Basti town near Gorakhpur.Building on the theme, Modi said the situation was very different in UP, where the entire government machinery was set in motion to catch the thieves involved in lifting a buffalo.His reference was to SP minister Azam Khan's buffaloes which had gone missing in Rampur, and police had tracked them down.At Basti, PM Modi also recited a poem on the donkey by Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena, a well-known poet from the town. ""Neta ke do topi gadhe ke do kaan; topi adal badal kar pehne gadha tha hairan; ek roz unko gadhe ne tang gali mein ghera; kayi dulatti jhaar un par aur jor se renka; neta ur gaye topi ur gayi ur gaye unke kaan; beech sabha mein khada ho gaya gadha seena tan.""Roughly translated, the poem means: A leader had two caps, a donkey had two ears; donkey was upset to see leader changing his cap, one day the donkey cornered him at an alley and kicked him hard; the neta flew, so did his cap and his ears; the donkey stood with pride before the people.After reciting the verse, Modi said Saxena's poem was an apt reply to the donkey jibe.At a rally in Raebareli, Akhilesh had taken a dig at Modi by referring to a Gujarat tourism promotion campaign featuring actor Amitabh Bachchan. ""There's an ad on TV which feature donkeys. I appeal to this century's biggest movie star, please stop endorsing the donkeys of Gujarat),"" Akhilesh had said.""Akhilesh ji has not even spared donkeys,"" Modi said, amid cheers from the crowd at the Bahraich rally. ""You are even afraid of donkeys,"" he added.""Donkeys don't differentiate whether it is carrying 'chini' (sugar) or 'chuna' (lime)"", the PM said.Modi said people who were unaccountable had no right to ask for votes. ""Votes are pious. Five years ago you voted for SP but they turned UP into a state of misery where law and order is entirely missing. They are doing everywhere but not answering what they did in these five years. If one is not accountable, one has no right to ask votes,"" he said.Alleging that lawlessness ruled the state, Modi said, ""The complaint of the poor is not registered in police stations unless police get approval from musclemen... Crime and mining has become the leading trade of the state.""A major part of Modi's speech focussed on sugarcane farmers in this cane belt. ""Mulayam Singh promised you five years back that the Munderwa sugarcane mill will be restarted. I want to ask you that whether he fulfilled his promise? Sugar mills are closed and sugarcane farmer is in bad state.""""I'll tell you how work is done. As we came in power, we waived loans of Rs 22,000 crore of cane farmers and the money directly reached 32 lakh farmers without a mediator,"" he said.Training his guns on the Congress, Modi said, ""In 2012, Congress had no agenda and it was contesting the state election on the promise that it would raise the limit of LPG cylinders from nine to 12. But it is we who have given LPG connections to poor households.""With a touch of sarcasm, he said, ""People are unhappy with me as medicines which were selling for Rs 30,000 now cost just Rs 3000 and the price of stents used in heart disease has come down from Rs 1.25 lakh to Rs 25,000. All the people who were making huge profits are angry with me.""Those with black money too were angry, Modi said touching on demonetisation. ""Those who were hoarding money in Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes have also become angry with me,"" he said."

Shopping for daily-consumption grocery products is set to get more expensive thanks to higher input costs.Companies including Britannia Dabur and Parle are either raising prices or cutting quantities in packaged products after the cost of ingredients such as sugar, milk powder and palm oil increased by 20-80% over the past year on account of fluctuating global commodity prices and lower production cycles.The price hikes come as the consumer goods industry still nurses the wounds of demonetisation , which crippled demand, and endured at least four quarters of subdued growth as consumers cut back on discretionary spending.Biscuit maker Britannia said prices of its biscuits will go up by up to 7%, while Wipro Consumer Care , the manufacturer of the country's third-largest soap brand Santoor, said prices will rise about 5%.Amul, the nation's top ice-cream maker, said prices are up 5-8% after a two-year gap due to higher sugar and milk powder prices.Others such as Parle and Dabur are either reducing quantities or clamping down on promotions, which indirectly amount to price increases. ""We will cover up the inflation hit and hike prices 6-7%,"" said Varun Berry, managing director of Good Day biscuit maker Britannia.Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting chief executive officer Vineet Agrawal said prices of soap will go up for the first time in three years.The maker of Santoor soap said the hike is on account of increasing palm oil prices, a key ingredient. ""Cost pressures are definitely more than what they were and it is starting to reflect on retail shelves now. Our focus is always topline growth,"" Agrawal said. Industry analysts said demand for palm oil from core importers such as India and China has resulted in stiffening of prices. Palm oil is also a key ingredient for detergents and cosmetics.Religare Capital Markets wrote in a report earlier this month that gross margin pressures have been visible with players initiating selective pricing actions. ""Poor demand has weighed on the Indian consumer sector over the last two years. Additional headwinds from demonetisation and GST (goods and services tax) could have a lasting disruptive impact,"" Religare wrote in the report.Parle Products, which makes confectionery and salty snacks besides biscuits, said it has reduced the weight of its confectionery and snacks category after almost four years.""The price hike is all indirect in the form of weight reduction and translates to anywhere between 8-12% of price hikes,"" said BK Rao, marketing manager at Parle Products. Confectionery and snacks account for 15% of the company's sales, he said.Besides selling less quantity at the same price, some companies have scaled back freebies. ""We are curtailing consumer promotions - which is a proxy for price hikes - to offset inflation across various input costs,"" said Sunil Duggal, CEO of Vatika shampoo and Real juices maker Dabur. ""We will wait for volumes to stabilise this quarter before taking up pricing.""Ice-cream makers including category leader Amul have topped up prices 5%-8% ahead of the peak season, a move that has come after two years. Amul managing director RS Sodhi attributed the price hike to milk, sugar and skimmed milk, which have become 30-90% costlier.Mother Dairy Fruit & Vegetable business head (dairy) Subhashis Basu said the company plans to revise prices. ""Considering the increase in input costs, we are contemplating increase in prices for the season,"" Basu said."

We have most of the sugar mills here apart from sports goods industry and other export-driven units. Speedy transport system is of immense importance to the region. There are fairly good chances that we will have a synchronized effort from state and Centre to make this airport a reality now.""A Muzaffarnagar-based government official, who didn't wish to be named, said, ""The distance between Meerut and the state capital is 500 km. Train journey on the route is time-taking and arduous. The air passage will increase productivity of frequent commuters.""The genesis of this proposal dates back to February 2010 when the then UP government had decided to shift the proposed airport from Noida to Meerut. The then principal secretary for civil aviation, UP government, had issued a notification in this regard and had invited bids for appointment of consultants for the setting-up of airport. Meerut Development Authority (MDA) was appointed the nodal authority and the existing airstrip on the outskirts of the city near Gogol village was to be developed as a full-fledged airport. However, the project that was slated for completion in 2016 never took off.After years of negotiations, it was not until February 24, 2014, that an MoU was signed between state government and Airports Authority of India (AAI) to develop seven airports in Uttar Pradesh, including Meerut.According to the MoU, the UP government had agreed to provide the required land logistic report for the development of the airports. But till date, there is little progress in this regard.A total of 158.7 hectares of land was required for the project in Meerut. Most of the land bank belonged to the farmers of two villages, Gagol (120 hectares) and Kashi (106 ha). After prolonged negotiations, a rate was fixed at Rs 5,800 per square metre.Funds of Rs 920 crore needed for land acquisition never arrived. Besides, the project also includes 30 acres of forest land and the forest department did not give the land to AAI as the latter did not issue certificate that minimum trees would be cut.These and many other issues including political hostilities between the state and Centre put a spanner in the progress of the project.Vivek Bhaskar, assistant town planner, ADA -- the nodal agency for the designated project, told TOI, ""The new government in Lucknow is seeking detailed reports of all proposed or unfinished projects in the state with fresh perspective. And, airport project in UP is certainly one of them. A huge amount of work in Meerut airport project has already been done. Now the government has to issue fresh directions in this regard. Once this is done, issues like technical viability survey can be taken up and with decisive leaderships in both Centre and state, all hurdles can be removed. We are only awaiting orders."""

""It was for the first time our water was given to Aurangabad to serve the beer factories there during drought. Many BJP leaders have beer and sugar factories and the one-time water supply is due to that reason,"" he alleged.""If demonetistation was meant to stop terrorism, then why did terrorist attacks take place in Kashmir two days back and today,"" Aaditya said."

ISMA projected sugar production at 234 lakh tonnes for 2016-17 during its first advance estimates of the crop in September last year""Considering that some sugar mills have closed their operations in the drought affected areas mostly in Maharashtra and Karnataka and field reports that sugarcane availability in these two states is lower than earlier expectations, ISMA decided to revise its estimates of sugar production for 2016-17 sugar season,"" the association said.Sugar recoveries and yields have also gone down in parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Sugar production in the current season (till January 15) has been pegged at 104.8 lakh tonnes, around 5% lower than the same period the previous year.ISMA, however, said that there would neither be any shortage of sugar nor any need to import sugar. ""There is enough sugar to meet the domestic requirement and yet leave a healthy balance for the next sugar season,"" it said.Despite the decline in production, a high opening balance of 77.5 lakh tonnes in the 2015-16 season would enable the sugar industry to end the season with a closing stock of 48.5 lakh tonnes, which is equivalent to at least 2 months of sugar consumption.""Now that sugar mills, in the drought affected areas, have started closing down, the difference (in sugar sales) from last year will be higher as the season progresses,"" ISMA said. Sugar sales during the first quarter of the 2016-17 season (October-December 2016) has declined 8.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) or by 5.5 lakh tonnes.Total sales by mills was pegged at 248.5 lakh tonnes in the 2015-16 season. As per the field reports, it is certain that sales during the 2016-17 season will be lower than that of last season, ISMA said. Sales in January is also projected to be lower compared to last year when sugar mills had sold 25 lakh tonnes.""Assuming that in the balance eight months of the current season i.e. from February to September, there is similar sugar sales in comparison to last year and assuming that the sugar sales/despatches are similar to last year, sugar sales in the current season will be around 242 lakh tonnes,"" ISMA said."

The accused, Mathura resident Devendra Kumar, had been sacked for his involvement in criminal activities in 2007. UP Police had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 on his arrest.An STF team had been tracking Devendra for several days. Based on a tip-off, the team was sent to Kagrol in Agra for patrol checks. The accused arrived on a motorcycle.When the cops signaled him to stop for checking, he opened fire at them. The police returned fire and arrested him.Police seized a country-made revolver, two live cartridges and one TVS Apache motorcycle from his possession.Raj Kumar Mishra, deputy SP (Noida STF), said Devendra was a Class X passout and was selected as a UP Police constable in 1997. He was posted in Ambedkar Nagar after his joining, and was shifted to Agra next year. Devendra robbed a businessman of Rs 3 lakh in Mathura in 2000. He was arrested, suspended from service and put behind bars for nine months.Police said that he made contacts in jail and continued to be involved in criminal activities after he was released. Devendra formed a gang with Harkesh, Hariom, Dharmendra and Dabbu Pandit, whom he had met in jail.

The policymakers have identified food processing as a key sector in encouraging labour movement from agriculture to manufacturing.By 2024, food processing sector is expected to employ 9 million people in India and expected to generate about 8,000 direct and 80,000 indirect jobs in the state, the ASSOCHAM-Grant Thornton joint study on 'Food Retail: Investment: Infrastructure' noted.According to the study, Indian food processing industry is pegged close to US$ 121 billion to US$ 130 billion. With the second largest arable land in the world, it is the largest producer of milk, pulses, sugarcane and tea in the world and the second largest producer of wheat, rice, fruits and vegetables.Despite the massive production, the degree of processing is low and ranges between 2-35% for different produce. India is one of the top rankers in the production of bananas, guavas, ginger, papaya etc., although processing levels in the country remain limited. This indicates an extensive opportunity in the food processing sector, adds the paper.According to the joint study, Indian food and retail market is projected to touch US$ 482 billion by FY 2020 from the current level of US$ 258 billion in 2015, adds the paper.With globalisation and increasing trade across the borders approximately about 460 million tons of food valued at US$ 3 billion is traded annually. India has thus a great potential for global trade in agricultural and processed food products. The share of food processing exports in total exports was around 12% in the last few years. During FY 2011-15, India's exports of processed food related products have been growing at a CAGR of 23.3%.The unorganised sector accounts for 42% of India's food processing industry. The sizeable presence of small-scale industries points to the sector's role in employment generation. As per the study, though the market falls under the unorganised sector in the country, the organised sector has a larger share in the secondary processing segment than the primary one.Food and grocery constitute a substantial part of India's consumption basket accounting for around 31% share in the total. In contrast, consumers in other countries spend a much lower proportion of their income on food and grocery  9% in the United States (US), 17% in Brazil and 25%in China. Food and grocery is the largest segment in India's retail sector, with a share of more than 60% in India's total retail market in 2014.India is the world's second largest producer of food after China. The arable land area of 159.7 mn hectares (394.6 mn acres) is the second largest in the world (after the US). India has a strong raw material base for the food processing industry. India is one of the largest producers of certain fruits, vegetables, pulses, cereals and dairy products such as mangoes, papaya, potatoes, onions, ginger, check peas, rice, wheat, groundnuts, milk and eggs among others.Demand for food processed food rising with growing disposable income, urbanisation, young population and nuclear familiesHousehold consumption set to double by 2020Changing lifestyle and increasing expenditure on health and nutritional foodsIndian benefits from large agriculture sector, abundant livestock and cost competitivenessInvestment opportunities arise in agriculture, food infrastructure and contract farmingDiverse agro-climatic conditions encourage cultivation of different cropGovt. expect US$ 21.9 bn of investment in food processing infrastructure by 2015Investment including FDI would rise with strengthening demand and supply fundamentalsLaunch of infrastructure development schemes to increase investment in food processing infrastructure"

A whopping 54% funds, as a result, remain unspent and ready for use by the new BJP government.In February 2016, former CM Akhilesh Yadav had tabled his last full annual budget of Rs 3,46,935 crore for 2016-17. In August 2016, Akhilesh also tabled a supplementary budget of Rs 25,347.87 crore for the 2016-17 fiscal.On March 31, 2017, the last working day of the previous fiscal, while the Public Works Department (PWD), irrigation, were among the departments recording the highest utilisation of funds, large departments like urban development, transport, health and agriculture utilised less than 50% of the funds allocated to them in 2016-17.Government insiders attributed the sub-par performance to two reasons: first, the Samajwadi Party family feud that kept government functioning in a limbo in the last quarter of 2016, second, the poll code of conduct that was enforced with effect from January 2017. Officials said the last six months, therefore, were spent only executing some key projects identified as flagship programmes of the government, even as the remaining took a back-seat.SP minister Shivpal Singh Yadav's PWD had made the largest demand for grantsnearly Rs 4,547 croreabout 18% of the supplementary budget in 2016-17. Against the demand, fund utilisation of PWD grants is above 80%. Other top performers include the departments of estate, higher education, science and technology and food and civil supplies, which had raised a demand for Rs 1,500 crore in the supplementary budget.The primary education and social welfare (SC special component plan) departments, which raised a demand for grants worth Rs 3,600 crore and Rs 1,200 crore respectively, however, were among the laggards. While the primary department only utilised 2.91% funds allocated to it, the social welfare department used 41.69% funds. Similarly, while the SP government sought Rs 2,000 crore for relief and rehabilitation work in the supplementary budget, it could only spend 2.09% through the department of relief and rehabilitation.The sugarcane development department could also only spend 4.08% of its total allocation in 2016-17, while the Muslim Waqf department spent 31.22%, heavy industries 10.61% and environment department 31.38% of the funds allocated to it during the previous fiscal."

They attribute the fleeting birds to various bunds built on canals that restrict the amount of water the site receives.The groves typically have thorny trees, which are partly submerged in water, making it an ideal nesting and breeding environment for various bird species. The groves also protect the birds from predatory animals.In the latest edition of the Ela Journal for Forestry and Wildlife, its chief editor Satish Pande mentions, ""In western Maharashtra, during the months of January to April such heronries resound with the cacophony of breeding birds. While some of these sites depend on the success or failure of southwest monsoon, others in watershed areas are solely dependent on irrigation canal-fed water."" The quarterly journal is jointly published by the state's forest department and Ela Foundation.Owing to dipping groundwater levels and increasing plantation of sugarcane, a cash crop which requires a lot of water, many bunds are being built on the canals that feed the heronries. This is the case with Bhadalwadi, located near Bhigwan town on the Pune-Solapur highway.""The site, which at one time hosted thousands of birds, has seen a decline of nesting bird population by almost 70%, due to the water shortage over the past two years. Now, owing to tree felling and dry land, the birds only occupy a smaller part of the site that still has some water accumulation. We need to plan and move fast before the site is abandoned entirely by the birds,"" Pande told TOI.The biggest cause for concern is that two endangered species, Eurasian Spoonbill and Painted Stork, also breed here. ""The forest department has shared this concern and two years ago, the site was included under the National Program for Wetland Conservation. Funds have been allocated to the site for the same. However, a plan needs to be formulated to best utilise the funds,"" he said.Pande suggested that since the water supply comes through the irrigation department, while the concern for the birds at the site is under the forest department, there needs to be an inter-departmental meeting to urgently form a plan to conserve the sensitive site."

Liquor prices are likely to shoot up from next month. The reasons: Drought and demonetization.The Karnataka Brewers and Distillers Association , the nodal agency for liquor manufacturers' in the state, has given a representation to chief minister Siddaramaiah seeking a hike in liquor prices as the input costs, especially that of extra neutral alcohol(ENA), have gone up in the past one year. ENA is highly concentrated ethanol (drinking alcohol) that is sourced from molasses, a byproduct of sugarcane.The association has sought an increase of Rs 35 per case in all slabs of liquor. In Karnataka, a case contains around nine litres of liquor and there are 17 slabs slotted on the basis of the maximum retail price. With severe drought having affected sugarcane cultivation in the state, the availability of molasses has reduced significantly.""It's been a tough year for liquor manufacturers in the state. There's a steep fall in sugarcane production and hence, the availability of molasses has been considerably reduced. The landing cost of ENA has gone up by Rs 7.02 per litre in the past one year,"" association president Arun Kumar Parasa said.While the price of ENA was Rs 45.25 per litre in January 2016, it touched Rs 52.27 in January 2017; the landing cost per case has increased by Rs 28,78.Association secretary general Shivalingaiah said the availability of molasses has come down by 40 per cent compared to the previous year.""A fallout of this has been is the rise in ENA price. Many distillers have not been able to reach the break-even point because of the sudden increase of ENA price. Compounding the woes of the distillers is the rise in labour wages, transport fees and other overhead costs.""While the distillers cite drought for seeking a price hike, the government feels that a hike could help it overcome revenue shortfall caused following Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's demonetization exercise.During a financial review held by chief minister Siddaramaiah in December 2016, the government expected a revenue shortfall of Rs 3,000 crore because of demonetizaton. Though the excise department had managed to meet the revenue targets that had been set for it, a section of the bureaucracy feels that the best option for shoring up revenues is by increasing liquor prices. But the ball is in the CM's court and a clear picture would emerge when he presents the budget next month.'Don't close distilleries for 15 days during polls'The Karnataka Brewers and Distillers Association has urged the government to amend the Panchayat Raj Rule-308AC(c) that mandates closure of all distilleries and breweries located in the panchayat limits where the polls are being held, for 15 days.Briefing the chief minister on the issue during the pre-budget discussions on Friday, the members said the closure is an extreme measure that causes huge revenue loss. ""When dry days for other polls, including parliamentary and assembly elections, are just two days, why the same is 15 days for panchayat polls?"" they asked.According to the association, the closure of distilleries and breweries would affect production and prompt customers to switch over to different brands."

The department has categorically told KMF, which markets milk products under the brand name Nandini, that milkshake is not milk.The debate on whether milkshake can be classified as milk went on for over six months in bureaucratic circles, before the commercial taxes department came out with the verdict which was notified by the Karnataka government on February 9.It all started when KMF approached the department stating that milkshake falls under serial number 24 of the first schedule (which mentions the products eligible for tax exemption) of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act-2003 (KVAT Act-2003). Serial no. 24 pertains to milk and pasteurized milk.Citing a Madras High Court judgment in a similar case, the KMF had stated that milkshake prepared by sterilization of toned milk at high temperature by adding sugar, colour and flavour is capable of being classified under serial no. 24 of the first schedule of KVAT Act -- 2003.However, the commercial tax department chose to apply Wikipedia's definition of milkshake as a ""sweet, cold beverage which is usually made from milk, ice cream or iced milk and flavours or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate sauce or fruit syrup"", and ruled: ""Milkshake is not fresh milk or pasteurized milk per se, but is a different commodity made from milk. Hence, it cannot be classified as milk."" The department ordered that milkshake manufactured and marketed by KMF is liable to tax at 14.5% as per the KVAT Act-2003.The department also stated that if KMF were to sell pasteurized milk without any additives such as sugar, colour and flavour it could have been eligible for tax exemption. The other option was to coax the government to include milkshake in the list of products that have been extended tax exemption.Sources in KMF maintained that they would appeal to chief minister Siddaramaiah to exempt milkshake from tax"

The direction also says that if any stock from these batches has already been supplied from the depots of the Karnataka State Beverages Corporation Limited , necessary action should be taken to stop their retail sales.On the direction of the commissioner of excise department, the deputy commissioners of all the districts, including Bengaluru city, have issued the orders. As per the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), a sample is drawn from each batch of beer before bottling and these are tested for the requirement of ethyl alcohol content and pH (numeric scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution) that is specified. After bottling, three samples are drawn from each batch again for checking various requirements.The contamination was found in bottled beer. The lab report on the batches in question, as quoted by the department's orders, says the bottled samples were procured on February 28, March 7 and March 10, and sent to the central lab for tests.The tests found the presence of ethyl alcohol in the normal limits, and no poisonous substances were found.The report of the lab states, ""Presence of ethyl alcohol is detected in the above stated bottles and they are free from methyl alcohol. But in all above sample bottles (we) found hazy infusion and sedimented particles with settleable solids. Hence they are unfit for consumption.""As per BIS standards, beer is tested for contamination by poisonous substances. Floating matter or visible residues are also a strict no.Sources say that some of the beer from these 15 batches may have already reached retailers. This will become the first instance of beer being recalled after it has left the breweries.Officials of the excise department are, however, refusing to comment on the issue on record. But sources in the lab said they have submitted a report stating that some of the batches of beer tested, were was not fit for consumption.However, the whole issue could be because of wrong samples being tested, according to some sources in the department. The samples taken from the brewery may have been collected before it had undergone proper process like pasteurization. This could have given a wrong reading in the lab because it was raw beer sample. There are plans for testing new samples from the beer batches afresh.It is legally specified that ""Beer shall be free from any ingredient that is injurious to health, chloral hydrate, ammonium chloride, pyridine diazepam, paraldehyde, and any added colouring matter, except caramel produced from sugar."""

This is already affecting close to 40,000 people, and with the mercury level rising with each passing day, the prevailing drought has become the biggest worry in the city. At times like this, it is vital to do all that we can to preserve water, and that is a lesson that farmers in Belagavi can learn from Abhay Muthalik Desai , who has been preaching and practicing organic farming , which not only does away with the need for chemicals, but also requires lesser amount of water.A chemical engineer by profession, Abhay made the switch to organic farming some years ago, and has since been reaping profits to the tune of Rs 15 lakh by selling jaggery made from the organic sugarcane. ""I own 10 acres of land on which I produce only organic sugarcane  there are strictly no chemicals used. This method utilizes less water and there is also very little wastage. After the sugarcane is cut, there are certain byproducts that are left over, which are spread on the field. This ensures that the crop doesn't require too much water. What's more, the byproduct turns into compost in time, which only aids in securing a good yield. This also means that we require less labour, thereby cutting down costs further,"" he says.Considering that North Karnataka faces the risk of drought this year as well, organic farming is a viable method. ""We require only 120 gallons of water as compared to 900 gallons of water that is required for regular farming that utilizes chemicals. Our method is so effective that we have been certified by the Control Union of Certification ,"" Abhay signs off. Krishna Kamble"

However, for actress Ridhi Dogra , a meaty role that gives her ample opportunities to explore her acting skills is what matters most. Excerpts:Honestly I was scared. Now that Woh Apna Sa is on air, I'm feeling the jitters. But I have been waiting for such a meaty role that people can relate to. While I enjoyed playing the goody two-shoes kind of characters, we have to understand that everyone is an equal mix of sugar and spice, and I wanted to explore that genre, where not everything is nice.I took this break because of two reasons. Firstly, I wasn't getting any interesting offers. Secondly I was clouded by too many things and was rethinking about my decision of whether I want to act further or to take a different path. I travelled a lot, also undertook Vipassana and learnt many things that helped me take a clear decision of staying in this profession. Also doing Khatron ke Khiladi, Season 6 helped me in many ways. Everyday I had to face a new fear and fight it out. The two year break taught me a lot about myself.Audience is the king. When it comes to TV shows and its content, producers will only make those kind of shows/ stories that appeal to the masses. A majority of our viewership is in rural India. So, showmakers are churning out stories that most audiences prefer.I wouldn't say that women aren't getting to explore varied roles on TV, but yes there are actresses like Jennifer Winget who are trying to do something different. There is definitely a shift in the Indian TV content. While many still to like to play safe, others are trying to break the pattern and do something new. Again at the end of the day it also depends on the audiences, if they aren't liking something, the storyline is tweaked to suit their needs.I wouldn't mind doing reality shows. Be it Khatron... or my dancing stint with, my husband Raqesh Vashisth on Nach Baliye , I enjoyed all of them. However, Big Boss is something that I would never take up. It's not my cup of tea."

""The drug reduces inflammation , enhances immune response and the efficacy of conventional TB drugs. Some research has even shown that it improves control of TB infection and decreases disease severity. We want to see if this will work as adjunctive therapy for improving the effective treatment of TB in our population,"" she said.Doctors say the relationship between TB and diabetes isn't new. As of now, patients testing positive for diabetes at government facilities are referred to undergo examination for TB. TB patients are also asked to check their blood glucose levels. In 2016, a guideline was framed by the central TB division after studies showed people with diabetes had 2-3 times higher risk of contracting TB. TB patients are also asked to check their blood glucose levels.A study by Dr Vijay Viswanathan, chief diabetologist at Chennaibased M V Hospital for Diabetes, and University of Massachusetts Medical School found that 54.1% of the 209 patients surveyed with pulmonary tuberculosis were diabetic, while 21% were pre-diabetic. ""According to data, every fourth person has latent TB, which surfaces when the immune system is weak,"" said Dr Viswanathan. ""Diabetes increases the risk of progression to active TB disease in people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB. Conversely, TB has an effect on diabetes. It can not only worsen blood sugar control but also complicate clinical management of diabetes.The TB-diabetes combination is as bad as TB and HIV,"" he said.Now, scientists say, adding metformin, even if the patient's sugar levels are normal, may not just prevent or delay diabetes, but also improve outcomes of TB treatment.So, a select group of people will receive the drug during the five-day antibiotics treatment.Last year, the World Health Organization increased its estimate of the number of new TB patients in India to 2.8 million in 2015 compared to 2.2 million in 2014. India, now, is home to more than a quarter of the global TB population.A bacterial disease commonly affecting the lungs, TB can be cured using a cocktail of antibiotics for six months. These drugs are available for free in India which, however, hasn't been able to drastically bring down infection rates due to lack of awareness and access to treatment.The Indian Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme uses thrice-weekly treatment with standard drug doses. Recently, scientists trying to find out reasons for poor outcomes studied 1,912 adult TB patients receiving anti-TB treatment in Chennai and found the concentration of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide in the blood inadequate in a majority of the population. Rifampicin was inadequate in more than 90% of the population. ""We have now increased the treatment to five days a week.We are hoping it will make treatment effective and reduce risks of drug resistance. It has rolled out in five states. By the end of the year, it will be the standard for people across the country,"" Dr Swaminathan said."

""Every decision in this respect was taken following all due procedures,"" he told TOI on Saturday.""The FIR registered against me with the Kherwadi police is on the basis of wrong information,"" he claimed.Marathwada Mitra Mandal secretary Mohan Deshmukh alleged that Nilangekar, who was removed as the Mandal president a few months ago, had sold off a 3 acre land belonging to the trust, which is worth several thousand crore of rupees, as if it was his own property.The Mandal was formed in 1965 with an aim to run student hostels and education projects among other things in Mumbai for people from Marathwada, he told reporters here.Former chief minister S B Chavan, who hailed from Nanded in Marathwada region , was the founder president and trustee of the Mandal that was allotted 11,000 square meter of land in Bandra East in 1981.""However, later, Nilangekar was elected as the president of the trust. Instead of fulfilling the objectives of the trust, he chose to sell the land in a questionable manner, and without taking the trustees into confidence,"" said Deshmukh.The trust's secretary alleged that Nilangekar had indulged in various financial irregularities involving the trust. ""For instance, he withdrew money from the bank without permission and indulged in financial transactions.

An RTI activist has locked horns with the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) to make public the laboratory test results of Neera sold in the city during the winter season.RTI activist Rajesh Modi had sought information two months ago from the civic body on the health benefit of Neera, the most popular drink among Surtis during the winter season. Modi sought to know about the contents and mixtures through the laboratory testing and inform the public at large whether it is healthy to consume or not.The sale of Neera starts with the commencement of the winter season. There are couple of shops run by Khadi Gram Udhyog Sangh selling the drink, whereas there are many individuals selling the drink on the roadside in every nook and corner of the city.Residents, usually relish the drink in the morning, as they believe that Neera becomes todi, if consumed after noon.Following continuous reminders, the SMC's health department took samples of Neera from three areas including Adajan, Rander and Khatodara. The samples were sent for laboratory testing at Rajkot. While the reports of two samples, as per the health department, is awaited, the first report suggested the drink was 'safe'.Talking to TOI, Modi said, ""There is no harm in making the test reports public. Just saying that the samples are ok, doesn't serve the purpose. People actually want to know about the contents in the Neera.""Modi added, ""If the Neera juice is purely extracted from palm tree then it is good for health, but if it is just a sugary juice then it could harm many lives, especially those suffering from diabetes. I don't understand why the civic body is shying away from making the test results public.""According to Modi, he is soon going to approach the state health department for making a thorough investigation into the Neera juice contents.""The samples are passed in the laboratory testing.

Dr VVL Narasimha Rao , medical superintendent of Government Regional Eye Hospital , Vizag, talks about the various eye ailments observed in this region, eye problems in children, tips to maintain healthy eyes, eye camps and so on.Among the eye ailments refractive errors (myopia or inability to see objects at a distance and astigmatism, which refers to imperfect curvature of the cornea) are seen in about 15-20% patients - who are mostly school going children. In the elderly population, especially for those above 40s, it's hypermetropia or difficulty in reading or seeing nearby objects. Cataract is also seen in men and women in their 50s and 60s. Apart from this, there's age related muscular degeneration of the eyes and glaucoma as well as diabetic retinopathy among diabetic patients. Malnutrition and Vitamin A deficiency-related eye problems are found in children.It depends on the age of the person and presence of ailments like diabetes. School children need to be screened regularly at least once a year till the age of 18 years to detect refractive errors. Once the individual reaches 40 years of age, check-up should be done every two years. But if the person is diabetic, then every year, eye test should be undertaken. If one is a diabetic patient for about 10 years, then eye testing is advisable every six months and every three months if the patient is diabetic since 15 years.Laser technique is useful mainly for myopia and diabetic retinopathy. But laser surgeries may not be suitable for all. It depends on the thickness of the cornea. If the cornea thickness is above 500-550 microns, it's suitable. For cataract, laser surgery is not really required.Squints are rectifiable while colour-blindness (inability to distinguish certain colours) is a genetic disorder and has no cure.At eye camps too, treatment is done on a par with routine institutional surgeries. In fact, in camps, patients are kept for three days while tribal patients are kept for five days but in hospitals, patients are usually kept for two days post operation. Where chances of infection is concerned, it can happen anywhere, not necessarily at the camps if proper precautions aren't taken. The equipment and machinery related to the surgery has to be double auto-claved at 130 degree Celsius for 40 minutes to destroy all germs. Most of the times, infections occur because of improper sterilisation. The eye drops or fluids come as bulk supply and even if there's a micro hole during the manufacturing process, the fluid gets infected and when it's used in surgery, infection and blindness may follow. At times, the fluid kept inside the plastic bottle may interact with the plastic when it gets heated for sterilisation. Chemicals harmful for the eyes may then be released.In case of cataract, the pupils become white and calls for immediate attention. Both diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma usually don't show obvious early symptoms but is usually detected in advanced stages. Chances of developing diabetic retinopathy is mostly five years after one had developed diabetes. Glaucoma is usually detected when vision falls and already 75% irreversible damage has occurred.Green leafy vegetables, carrots, eggs, fish, fresh fruits, milk, and all food items with vitamin A is recommended besides natural food rather than artificial ones with preservatives. It's also essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle, not to strain the eyes too much especially while studying and working on computers. Diabetic patients should keep blood sugar strictly under control to prevent damage to the eyes.Doc-talk will appear every alternative week.

Also, skipping a meal after eating the fruit might not be advisable as litchi contains a toxin , called methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), that can drastically bring down the blood sugar level, especially in children, making it lethal for them. Malnourishment adds to the fast deterioration of an affected person's health.A study by scientists from the US and India showed the dangerous combination of eating litchi on an empty stomach and skipping meal could result in acute low blood glucose level and lead to encephalopathy, a condition that altered brain functions, causing convulsions, coma and in some cases, death.Every year, especially during the litchi season of summer, several children in Bihar's Muzaffarpurfamous for its litchi productiondie. Bengal also witnessed the deaths of 13 children in Malda in 2014, but the exact reason could not be ascertained, though people suspected litchis caused them. The deaths led doctors and scientists to find the mystery behind.""The toxin present in litchi is also present in a fruit, called ackee. In Malda, children died of what was popularly called the 'litchi syndrome', which caused some kind of encephalitis. Children are more susceptible because of their low glucose reserve. Despite the toxin, the fruit itself is not harmful. It does not have a similar effect on all,"" said Dr Apurba Ghosh, director at Institute of Child Health. Besides MCPG, another toxin called, hypoglycin A, is present in litchi. The two together pulls down the blood glucose level, especially in kids, and those who are malnourished. Skipping the evening meal itself is known to deplete the blood sugar level at night. So, under-nourished kids, who skip evening meals after having litchi, are the most susceptible to disruption of fatty acid metabolism.At the time the kids died in Malda, a theory did the rounds that pesticides in unripe litchis could have caused the deaths but, scientists have refuted the argument, saying hypoglycin A and MCPG were at a much higher level in unripe fruits than the ripe ones. ""Unripe litichis also have a high level of pesticides, which is also harmful. We need to find out if the toxin levels are the same for all soil condition,"" said Dr Amiya Hati, former director at Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine."

In Rajasthan, by executing simple techniques, Singh's Tarun Bharat Sangh has rejuvenated 7 rivers that had almost died.""It doesn't need big engineering to save water bodies but simple common sense can work. If academicians are really serious about conserving wetlands they should ask students to respect nature,"" Singh said at a packed gathering of students, teachers and officials.Wetlands are linked to our lives and to face the 21st century challenges, teachers should sow the seeds by taking students' yatras to wetlands to know about their plight. ""Today, encroachments, pollution and over exploitation are biggest problems wetlands are facing. People need to come forward to fight injustice. Sadly, no education teaches to fight against injustice,"" the water conservationist said.Despite best irrigation facilities since independence, country is facing floods and droughts. Even today, 54% of India faces high to extremely high water stress.He blamed lack of political will for the mess. Citing example of Marathwada where leaders encouraged to grow sugar cane despite drought, Singh appealed to the farmers to link crop pattern with rain pattern.""Sustainable watershed management, groundwater recharge and stopping soil erosion were the main factors to save the situation. In Rajasthan, we showed the way by creating over 11,000 check dams and water conservation works in 10,840 sqkm area,"" said Singh.The water conservationist cited example of Maharashtra, where country's 40% large dams were built but the flip side is that it tops the list of farmers' suicides. ""This happened due to lack of planning and discipline,"" he added.Post inauguration, plenary lectures by SVC Kameshwara Rao, scientist with NRSC (ISRO), on Indian space technology applications, APCCF Sunita Singh on wetland conservation initiatives in Maharashtra and Yashwant Katpatal , professor with VNIT on shrinking wetland habitats."

Sravan is the youngest white tiger of the Trivandrum Zoo who gets a daily bath during summer.With the mercury levels rising, it's not an easy task for the zoo authorities to keep the animals 'cool' and healthy. In Trivandrum, the zoo officials have come up with special plans to ensure that the scorching summer heat doesn't hit its total of 128 species housed in about 36 acres of area. In Thrissur, the vets have made arrangements to provide proper shade and enough drinking water for the animals and birds.The zoo authorities in Trivandrum have started giving showers to animals around two-three times a day. Though the bath is given to all, the furry inmates find it more 'relaxing,' say the caretakers. It has become a routine affair for caretaker Raman to start his day with a shower to Malar, a female white tiger. Talking about the cub Sravan, Raman says, ""He is very playful and behaves like a small kid when we call him to give a bath. He enjoys the scrub we give him with hands, the most. Additionally, we have kept a pedestal fan near Sravan's enclosure. We also refill the tigers' pond regularly so that they could take a dip whenever they feel so.""Apart from Sravan, Bengal tigers like George, Rahul, Kiran, Manu and Ponni (lone female) and the three lions are also given baths. Deers and bears too are given baths to maintain their body temperatures.Similarly, in Thrissur zoo, which houses tigers and leopards, a large pool is where these felines venture out to chill. Binoy Babu, veterinary surgeon, says, ""While we ensure regular water supply, we also look for symptoms such as panting and drooling in animals.If we notice such discomfort, we give extra care."" The ostriches in the zoo are sprayed water at regular intervals, to keep them calm.Elaborating on Trivandrum Zoo's summer plans, its superintendent, TV Anilkumar says, ""For summer we have installed water sprinklers, fans and coolers in some of the animal enclosures. We already have a water recycling plant for gardening purpose. While the animals are provided drinking water by the city corporation, water from the natural pond inside the zoo is used for bathing them. Plans are also afoot to set up more air conditioning systems if the temperature rises abnormally.""He adds that the aquatic birds like herons, white ibis, storks and pelicans do not face much problems during summer as they have been housed in spacious open enclosure with provision for sprinklers and an artificial pond.The zoo's reptile house has even seven anacondas, which are kept in glass cages.C Thulaseedharan, supervisor of the reptile house says, ""Since their arrival from a Sri Lankan zoo in 2014, the anacondas have been kept in air-conditioned cages as they are accustomed to cold environment. We refill the water in their cages every now and then.""As part of the summer care, the diet plans of animals have a lot of cool food items in the menu. While the Thrissur zoo houses animals who are used to the tropical climate, Trivandrum has even Himalayan black bears.""For herbivores, we have modified their diet and provide seasonal fruits which have more water content. The black bears are given ice punch with fruits like watermelon,"" says Jacob Alexander, senior veterinary surgeon of the zoo. Radhakrishnan Nair, an animal keeper says, ""We give them a balanced diet with fruit ice punch and honey which are their favourite. Cucumber, rice, pineapple, pumpkin pieces and two boiled eggs form their daily diet.""To keep the apes hydrated, the zoo has been providing a menu that has groundnuts, bananas, variety fruits, sugarcane, sprouted pulses, vegetables and spinach.Just like humans the animals are also prone to summer diseases and heat strokes. The zoo authorities have added health supplements to animals' diet to ensure their wellbeing. According to the zoo vet, Jacob Alexander the medical add-ons are given by mixing it with food items. ""Every animal is provided with essential vitamins and B-complex supplements apart from their diet. For birds and deers, we mix electrolyte solutions and vitamin powders in the drinking water to reduce dehydration and heat stress. For carnivores we sprinkle the vitamin E and B-complex powder on the meat pieces. Monkeys are given tonics and vitamins using syringe dips in their mouths,"" says Jacob."

The decline happened right after - but that doesn't necessarily square up with GDP and corporate growth numbers. Corporates, of course, have been better managing their inventories - with consumer demand slowing down -- they have kept a sharp tab on expenses and have ensured they did not borrow too much post-demonetisation. There has also been a general demand in working capital,"" said Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank.""Another phenomenon is that corporate bond issuance has gone up. I think the lending that is happening on the term-loan side by banks was substituted by corporate bond issuance. We haven't been able to fully understand, the system-wide impact of demonetisation,"" he added.Loans from mining and quarrying saw the biggest drop in terms of volume to Rs 25.86 lakh crore from Rs 27.24 lakh crore. Another big contributor to the credit dip was the slowdown in infrastructure lending to Rs 9.02 lakh crore from Rs 9.88 lakh crore. The food processing sector as a whole saw a 12.4% decline year-to-date for FY2017-17; with the steepest declines coming from sugar (-26.6%)""Rather than being sector-specific, there has been a larger slowdown in credit because of macro-economic conditions. It is a trend reflecting the overall slowdown in lending and it will take a few more quarters before credit growth takes off,"" said Parthasarathi Mukherjee, MD, Lakshmi Vilas Bank.Infrastructure lending was down by 6.5%, with sharp declines in power (-8.4%) and telecommunication (-10.3%). However, given the government's push for increasing India's road network and highways, lending for road projects saw a marginal growth of 1.5%""Certain sectors like infrastructure are bound to take a bigger hit. Being labour intensive, there could have been a problem with paying workers in cash. Projects could have slowed down,"" said Barua.Chemicals, fertilizers, jute, petrochemicals, gems, jewellery, iron, steel, engineering and electronic products also saw a decline between 11-5%""There will be an uptick in credit going ahead. When corporates get more sure of consumer demand going up, they will increase inventory and then we will see credit offtake. The system is returning to normal,"" he added."

WOHD also offers the oral health fraternity a platform to take action and help reduce the overall disease burden.To mark the occasion, PGIMER, Chandigarh, taking the lead role planned various activities and held a talk on 'Oral Health - Challenges and Strategies' at the institute on Sunday to discuss promotion of oral health and increase penetration of oral health care into rural areas. On this occasion Dr K Gauba, head of the oral health sciences centre (OHSC), highlighted the need to integrate oral health with other healthcare programs to reach the rural community in a cost effective way. He stressed that poor oral health affects not only the ability to eat, drink and socialize but also has a proven effect on diseases like brain stroke, low birth weight babies, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis and many others.As part of the community outreach services, oral health check-up and oral cancer screening were conducted at a mega health camp organized at Jhandia village, Ropar, with support of Sat Sahib Trust, Punjab. OHSC assistant professor Dr Arpit Gupta and senior resident Dr Nishant interacted with the general public and told them about various diseases of the oral cavity and their prevention.For visually impaired children, oral health awareness and check-up camp was organized at institute for the blind in collaboration with Indian Dental Association (IDA) Chandigarh. IDA Chandigarh president Dr Gurvinder Dhamija and secretary Dr Sachin Rai stressed that oral health among children with special needs is compromised and requires special attention. Dr K Gauba highlighted that PGI is equipped with world class facilities and is committed towards providing oral health care services to all the children with special needs. The department's assistant professor Dr Manoj Kumar and senior resident Dr Rahul Morankar also gave preventive education and demonstrated correct way of brushing teeth for visually impaired children through audio tactile performance method.To reach the masses, awareness programs were carried out through different radio stations in the city.

For other communities also ushering in the new year this week, new beginnings are all about traditional food that celebrates myriad flavours, imitating life. We visit their kitchens to take stock of these traditions...Pen and pad in hand, youngsters Sanat and Shaunak Sarpotdar stand on the verandah of their 82-year-old family guest house overlooking Laxmi Road. They are finalising the Gudhi Padwa menu. This time, the young guns of the Sarpotdar family have taken it upon themselves to plan the naivedya (foodoffered as part of worship) and traditional fare that will be partaken of by family, friends and guests.The New Year is no time to compromise, so they've decided on 'paanch pakwan', a medley of five sweets. ""There's gulab jamun, shrikhand, basundi, jilebi and aamras. These are traditional, but the sweets might vary across households,"" informs Sanat. Why five, we ask. ""It's symbolic of a true feast; the fact that there's more than one sweet being offered today,"" Shaunak replies.Sanat's mother, Sadhana, has prepared the aamras specially using payri mangoes. ""This cultivar is pulpy and easy to digest, hence it is ideal for aamras, but some may use the hapus variety too,"" says Sadhana, who insists that the aamras should contain traces of mango bits for added texture. Fresh mango pickle, kairichi dal (prepared using soaked split Bengal gram, raw mango and condiments) and kairi panhe (cooling raw mango juice enhanced with spices and jaggery) are other preparations that will feature at the guest house on Gudhi Padwa.Kothrud resident Shilpa Bhide, who specialises in Maharashtrian cooking, explains one of the reasons why mangoes might find place on the table on the propitious day. ""The season for the king of fruits begins around this time, and especially in the Konkan region, the mango is a staple fruit. It's believed that there's no better prasad one can offer God,"" says Shilpa. Many households also prepare amrakhand (mango shrikhand), consciously incorporating the seasonal fruit into the day's menu. Shilpa adds that puran (a chickpea-jaggery mixture, enhanced with cardamom, saffron and nutmeg) is also a must during celebrations, which is why puran poli enjoys equal place on the table. ""It was customary for my grandmother to ready a katori of puran and kheer to offer for naivedya,"" adds Shilpa.But the neem chutney, or kadulimba is at the core of the meal. Sadhana says, ""It is made using new neem leaves, jaggery, tamarind, chillies and salt, and is considered a blood purifier."" Shilpa adds that some homes don't make this chutney. Each family member will then consume a neem leaf after praying. ""The leaves are bitter, so as children, we dreaded this ritual, but my grandmother would insist we each had a leaf,"" she quips.NIBM area resident Kavitadevi Vangala, her husband Hanuman and son Vishal are busy readying their home ahead of Ugadi, the New Year of the Telugu and Kannadiga communities, that falls on Wednesday. Besides the preparations, there's much to be done for the naivedya alone.Ugadi pachhadi is a key offering, synonymous with the festival, Kavitadevi tells us. ""This rich brown concoction is made with six ingredients or 'shaddruchi' (six tastes)  neem flowers, raw mango, fresh jaggery, fresh tamarind, salt and green chillies. It is enhanced with fresh coconut and bananas. The bitter, sweet, sour and other tastes of these elements come together, symbolising life's happy and all other moments we must embrace,"" says Kavitadevi. Her family will begin the day with a spoonful of this mixture post the prayers. Other traditional dishes that will be offered as naivedya comprise pulihora (tamarind rice), a rice/semya payasam, garelu (udid vadas), and boorelu (balls of puran dipped in an udid dal-rice batter and deep-fried).Like the Ugadi pachhadi, the Kannadigas prepare a similar offering, minus the spices, calling it bevu-bella. Fatima Nagar resident Chandrika Rao says, ""It's a simple mixture of tender neem leaves and powdered jaggery, offered to God."" After prayers, the mixture is distributed among the family. Chandrika adds that a feast on a banana leaf is customary during the New Year. ""The meal comprises a traditional pickle, two types of kosambari (South Indian salads), two vegetables, a vegetable gravy, rice, papad, bhajiyas, dal and payasam. All this needs to be served following a certain order, starting with salt, leading up to rice and dal that is topped with ghee,"" she informs. Puran poli is something that Chandrika will also make for her family.For the city's Sindhi community, Cheti Chand on Wednesday will begin with a journey to the river banks, with a portion of meethi tahiri (a sweet rice dish cooked with sugar, water and ghee). Camp resident Roshni Mahtani tells us that this is a key offering given to the fish who are considered the vehicles of their patron saint, Ishtadeva Uderolal, or Jhulelal.""Our new year meal isn't complete without the quintessential Sindhi-kadhi and chawal along with meethi boondi,"" says Roshni. But there are other preparations that one finds being made during Cheti Chand: kanav (a halwa of atta, sugar and ghee), Kabuli chana and mohanthal (a rich gram flour barfi). A visit to the mela at Cycle Society, Rasta Peth or Alpa Bachat Bhavan might be worthwhile, should you want to sample some of these delights.(Pics: Dean Lobo, Shashank Sane, Harshvardhan Shahi)"

Adequate amount of drinks including lime juice with salt and sugar, tender coconut water and butter milk suit the body. Elders should ensure that they consumed at least two litres of fluid per day.Going out in the afternoons without umbrellas is a strict no-no.

The board had asked the schools to compile a list of diabetics so that they could be provided with a 'snack break' during examinations.Speaking to TOI, president Sahodaya group of schools brother T Alex said all CBSE schools in Bhopal have given the list of students with type-1 diabetes and a special care would be taken for their snacks during exams.""We have informed all these students to provide genuine documents to support their cause. There are around 20 such students so far in our record,"" he said.""Considering that there are sizeable number of children who are suffering with type 1 diabetes and need insulin injections at regular intervals to manage their blood glucose level, the board has decided that such students appearing for the board's Class 10 and 12 examinations are permitted to carry eatables during exam,"" reads the circular from CBSE to schools in city.It further reads that these children need frequent meals to avoid hypoglycemia which may otherwise affect their health and performance.While coming to the examination centre, these students will be allowed to have or carry with them sugar tablets, chocolate, candy, fruits like Banana, apple, orange, snack items like sandwich and a small bottle of water (500 ml).However, the board has asked schools to observe and follow some modalities which necessitate such students to submit a certificate from a diabetologist along with full diabetic history, nature of their diabetes and the need for snacks during the examination which shall be forwarded by the principal of the school where the student is studying.Furthermore, the food items shall be kept with the invigilators at the examination centre concerned, who on the basis of student's need shall hand over the eatables to these candidates.Earlier, Dr Ashok Jhingan, chairperson of the Delhi Diabetes Research Centre, approached the board to consider the matter.Speaking to TOI Dr Ashok said this has been a biggest apprehension among parents of such students. He said students with type-1 diabetes depend on insulin injections. They tend to suffer from headaches, irritability, restlessness and confusion when they have to wait for too long between meals.Asked about the number of students of all age groups in Madhya Pradesh having type-1 diabetes, he said the rough figure goes upto 7,000 students in state."

Balrampur, in fact, was the seat from where former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee made his debut in national politics.""Vajpayee was elected from Balrampur in 1967. His election symbol was earthen lamp. As he remained away from Balrampur, everybody felt local demands were being neglected. I had grown up in this area and was very popular. Vajpayee was apprehensive of losing elections against me and decided to shift to his hometown Gwalior,"" said Tiwari who came dressed in white.Tiwari started out as village Pradhan in 1949 and graduated to becoming the local sarpanch in 1954, heading a dozen villages. After officiating as sarpanch for a decade, he took up the cause of sugarcane growers in '60s and was chosen to represent Balrampur by Congress.""Though we are contemporary, we came from different political ideology and were rivals,"" said Tiwari about Atal, adding, ""When he became the prime minister I approached him for a job for my son in merchant navy in Kolkata. Vajpayee said he would not be able to help. He forgot Balrampur and people forgot him,"" said Tiwari, who prefers to have 'khade chammach waali chai' (tea with seven spoons of sugar in which the spoon stands fixed). He is credited with setting up four railway stations in the Gonda-Balrampur belt in 1980s.An early riser, Tiwari visits his fields and does not suffer from diabetes or blood sugar. ""Vajpayee was destined to lead the country and I feel happy for him. Instead of mudslinging, leaders back then treated each other with great respect,"" he said. Tiwari said he voted for Congress candidate Zeba Rizwan. In Tulsipur, Samajwadi Party candidate is also in fray and voter turnout was 53%."

Sources said the Union food ministry has written to Union finance ministry to do away with Centre shelling out nearly Rs 4,500 crore annually as sugar subsidy to 30 states. There are indications of the budget announcing major reduction in this subsidy, which is borne by the Centre. Other ministries have also drawn up long wish lists for the budget.

Youth here invariably opts for career in armed forces prompting Indian army organise special recruitment camps in the village where mobile army canteens come every month for hundreds of retired personnel.Welcome to Gahmar, known worldwide as one of the most populated villages in the world. Around 130km from Varanasi, Gahmar is part of the Zamania assembly constituency in Ghazipur district. State minister and sitting MLA, Om Prakash Singh, as SP nominee, is pitted against BJP's Suntia Singh, a resident of Gahmar only. However, village pradhan, Meera Chaurasia's husband, Durga Chaurasia, is the ""de facto"" functionary in her place'pradhan pati' as they are called in UP Gahmar grabbed the limelight recently when Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his two rallies at Ghazipur last year and Mau a few days back recalled an incident of 1962 in the Lok Sabha when then sitting Ghazipur MP, Vishwanath Singh Gahmari a native of Gahmar made an emotional appeal in Parliament about extreme poverty in the region. His appeal had moved the then PM Pt JawaharLal Nehru and he formed the Patel Committee to make suggestions about poverty eradication in Purvanchal.As Modi recalled, Gahamri had cited as how people of the region picked cereals from the animal excreta (gobar) and eat, explaining extreme conditions people were forced to face. ""While harvesting, bulls often used to eat wheat and gram and used to release undigested. And the labourers filtered the gobar to use it as their meal,"" recalls Arun Kumar Singh, the only of the four sons of Gahmari, living in his native village.Gahamri passed away in 1974 but the Patel Committee, at his initiative, made several suggestions including construction of railway bridge over Ganga connecting Tarighat near Gahmar with Ghazipur. In an emotional appeal to voters of the region, Modi had mentioned about how the suggestions of the committee were ignored by the Congress for decades and his government has now started constructing the Tarighat-Ghazipur over bridge.""Our only wish is to dedicate the under-construction bridge to our father,"" demands Gahmari's son, Arun Singh, who lives on the five bigha ancestral land in the village. He says it will be a fitting tribute to his father as there is no memorial in his name in the entire district.Billed as vistas of prosperity in the region, Tarighat-Gahmar bridge is one of the fulfilled promises that the BJP boasts of while wooing the voters in the ongoing polls as the region will witness polling in the last phase on March 8. ""The Congress and other parties had dumped the suggestions for years and it was the BJP, which took the initiative of constructing the bridge after prime minister laid the foundation stone two months back,"" says BJP nominee Sarita Singh, who seems strongly placed thanks to the non-Yadav OBC and upper caste voters rallying behind the saffron party.Bihar leader Dadan Pehalwan's son Kartar Yadav is also in fray and his presence means split in the Yadav vote-bank damaging prospects of SP nominee Om Prakash Singh. BSP candidate Atul Rai, who was allegedly part of the Mukhar Ansari gang, pins his hopes on Dait-Muslim combination.As caste factor continues as key to polls, few talk about issues like handicaps in the farming sector despite being a fertile region across Ganga. ""Opium factory was closed years ago and sugar mills are also defunct. We don't grow cash crops despite being in the most fertile region,"" laments a Gahmar elderly, Ramashray Prajapati."

While Hindus here want timely payment for their sugarcane yields and promote bank transfers that have only halted since demonetisation, the Buddhist want connectivity for the tourist from across the globe.""We respect all partymen and invite them for our functions and take part in their ceremonies.

He was released in 2015. The accused used to supply small quantities of drugs, mostly in tourist places, with help of peddlers on commission basis.Kullu police had arrested Praveen Kumar Samal, 26, resident of Keonjhar district in Odisha, for drug peddling on February 11 and seized 15g heroin from his possession.

And food takes centre stage in all such diseases.Eating habits have changed a lot over the last two decades. Traditional foods, though trying to make a come back through certain promotional avenues, are largely categorised as foods for the weekends that require more time in the kitchen. Eating out and eating from packets are perhaps the daily norm. And this has certainly taken a toll on the peoples health.What is missed out when the people go in for packed foods are the minerals and nutrients available naturally in foods cooked at home and found aplenty in raw vegetables and fruits. It is a combination of nutrition from a variety of natural foods that helps keep balance in the diets.Pottassium, magnesium, vitamins and other micro-nutrients are found in a number of colourful vegetables and fruits. These help the body metabolism running in the right manner. Including fibrous foods in the diet helps the body to weed out unwanted matter too.An imbalance in the intake starts affecting a body in the long run. It is not just the blood pressure or the sugar levels that gets affected, the imbalances affect the whole body. Every cell in the body gets affected, be it in bones, muscles or any part of the body. The general metabolism happening in the cells is much dependent on many such small inputs that the body gets naturally.And, protection from cancer is to stop that one cell (or a group of cells) that has the capacity to become cancerous. It is not possible to do that always, but creating an environment for the cells to fight their little battles is an important aspect.It is here that preventing unhealthy lifestyles become important , says Dr. Ushashree Warrier, radiation oncologist, Cochin Cancer Research Centre.Informed dietary changes are protective steps. Daily exercise is a habit to be adopted while smoking and alcohol habits are to be shed.Since cancer continues to be a bad word in the society and the treatments continue to drain the people, physically, mentally and financially, the onus is on the people to take the first preventive steps. Though it is an era of information explosion, there is much misinformation too that is spreading around about cancer and other diseases.The hereditary possibility of lifestyle diseases like cancer is an important factor, but that contributes only 10% of the chances, says Dr. Warrier. Hence, the emphasis continues on the people to open up to practising preventive medicine.Even so, there are also instances when body may give indications and the people fail to take note of it. A self-observation of the body is important to know how it reacts to certain foods or environment and the changes that are occurring from time to time. But when a body reaction gets too prolonged, it is also time to consult a doctor.It could be sometimes a nagging cough or it could be a change in urine patten or the bowel moments or an unexplained abdominal ache.But if these do not get better even after going through any mode of treatment for two weeks or at the most a month, it certainly requires an expert advise.The idea is to screen for precancerous lesions in asymptomatic person who stand chance of developing the disease, says Dr. Warrier.Changes in the skin texture or colour, changes in breast like lumps or growth may or may not be cancerous. But the best thing about advanced technology and early detection of cancer is that the battles are generally won with a rate of over 90%.cure.Shyama Rajagopal"

This has led to the lack of habitat for these monkeys, which once thrived in the area without interfering with the farming activity. Local farmers said many monkeys from the neighbouring East Godavari district are also being dumped here by the farmers to save their agriculture produce from destruction.""This entire region was once a thriving agriculture and horticulture belt. Today, there are more than 300 monkeys in an area measuring 100 square kilometres. Though these monkeys do little damage to the horticulture plantations such as mango and cashew, they have a tendency to raid paddy and vegetable fields. It is because of this reason that we have stopped growing vegetables and paddy during the kharif season,"" said K Appala Raju, a former sarpanch of Gandipeta village.Farmers have taken to planting casuarina in fields where once sugarcane, paddy and vegetables were grown. ""More than 1,200 acres in the area has been converted into casuarina groves and this is not good as casuarina has a tendency to reduce ground water levels and suck the soils of minerals, thereby making them arid and unfit for agriculture in the long run,"" P Suranna, an agriculture field officer based in Makkavaripalem mandal, said.Another agriculture officer P Hema said much of the vegetables that are sold in the local shandies are from the agency area north of Narsipatnam.Not only are the primates destroying the produce, but also attacking people in the surrounding areas. ""The monkeys have now broken up into small families, numbering not more than five or six. Yet, they have a tendency to attack single people or those unarmed and without walking sticks. One of the main reasons is that they feel threatened and have a natural tendency to protect their young ones,"" pointed out Ch Raju, a farmer from Ramannapalem village.Sources in the forest department said these monkeys have realised that there is more food for them in the plains than in the denuded forests. They also have easy access to water and will be difficult to remove or dislodge. One forest officer said the problem would only get bigger.This entire region was once a thriving agriculture and horticulture belt.

Though his party is an ally of the BJP and constituent of NDA, it is up in arms against the state government on the issue of giving relief to farmers by way of loan waiver.Political leaders of all hues and farm activists have not taken kindly to Bhattacharya's remarks last week that repeated loan waiver if allowed would lead to farmers getting into habit of defaulting on bank dues expecting the relief. The protesters led by Shetty burned an effigy of SBI chairperson and condemned her for opposing relief at a time when farmers are in deep trouble and driven to suicide because of wrong government policies, bad market conditions and unsuitable weather.Talking to TOI, Shetty said the SBI's chief's remarks were insensitive. ""Till date the farm loans have been waived only twice, one time up to a small extent by the VP Singh government. In 2006, though the Manmohan Singh government claimed to have passed on a Rs71,000 crore of farmers' dues, the actual dues waived accounted for at only Rs52,000 crore,"" said Shetty. He cited the reply by finance minister Arun Jaitley in parliament to a question on the issue.""These sort of remarks coming from country's largest bank are shocking. The SBI happily offered huge loan to Gautam Adani for purchasing mines in Australia. Industry and business have failed to repay Rs6 lakh crores to banks. Yet, she thinks farmers do not need any relief. She should know that big defaulters like Vijay Mallya leave the country to escape repayment, but poor farmer has no other way but to end life when he is not able to repay loan,"" said Shetty.The farm leader was in Vidarbha to express solidarity with farm activists who observed a day's fast in memory of Yavatmal farmer Sahebrao Karpe of Chilgawhan village in Mahagaon thesil who committed suicide along with family on March 19, 1986 triggering a wave of farm suicides that remains unabated till date.""The government only understands language of numbers.

What's more, it may also be sweeter and better than the current crop.The Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed a new onion variety called 'multiplier onion variety,' which would make this possible.It is presently undergoing tests at multiple locations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat to evaluate its performance in different weather conditions. Scientists said initial findings of the tests are positive and have achieved the desired results so far.They added that the variety is expected to be released nationwide in 2019.Project leader Amar Jeet Gupta of DOGR told TOI, ""There is no special variety of onion for south Indian dishes that has been released at the national level. So far, farmers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are cultivating varieties developed by Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU). But the yield of these varieties is limited. Hence, we decided to develop the special variety, which can be recommended at national-level for other states farmers to grow it.""The variety, named DOGR-1549-Agg, is the first multiplier onion genotype registered with the ICAR-NBPGR (National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources) in New Delhi.Commenting on the variety's strength, Gupta said, ""It matures early and is suitable for both Kharif (July-October) and Rabi (October-March) seasons. It has an average yield potential of 22 tonnes to 24 tonnes per hectare."" Gupta added that the variety has six small bulbs per cluster.Presently, farmers in South India are growing TNAU-developed onion variety called CO(On)5, which can grow only in Rabi season and has a yield capacity of 18.9 tonnes per hectare. Each cluster of this variety produces three to five bulbs, Gupta said.TNAU's horticulture department head T Saraswati told TOI, ""This is a positive development for growers as they can get high harvest. Secondly, if this variety is released nationally, states other than the southern ones can also grow it.""When specifically asked about the taste of the newly-developed variety, Gupta said, ""Total Soluble Solids (TSS) is a crucial factor as it defines sugar percentage in the onion. The TSS of CO(On)5 is around 12%, whereas TSS in our variety is between 16% and 22%. Hence, it will be suitable for South Indian dishes."""

After the chanting of the ritualistic shlokas, cries of 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' and 'Gau Mata ki Jai' rent the air. Locals say the chanting is routine, but the sloganeering is not. Yet, everyone goes about their business as usual.With polling for the second phase of UP elections to begin in less than 24 hours, corner store conversations almost all dwell on the political possibilities locally as well as in UP. In Shahjahanpur, one of the talking points is the fate of the town's traditional 'Holi Ka Nawab' procession, if the local SP candidate Tanveer Khan unseats BJP's seven-time MLA Suresh Khanna.The controversial procession is an annual affair on Holi for as long as the locals can remember. ""A Muslim man is appointed Nawab. He's dressed and fed by the organisers for two days. Then, the night before the procession, he is made to consume so much alcohol that he is driven nearly senseless. The next morning, the procession travels from Chowk through most of the old city, with the Nawab being beaten with brooms, sticks and shoes,"" says Rajesh, a bystander at a local sweetmeat shop in Town Hall.The tradition has faced considerable opposition from the city's minority population, not only as hurtful for the community, but also because it is inhuman that a man should be treated thus. With the event having triggered riots in the past, local mosques are covered with an oil cloth lest the riotous crowd throws ink or colour at the structure. To prevent an outbreak of communal tensions, large contingents of security forces are deployed to walk with the procession as it travels through the city.Masoom Raza Khan, a local, even went to Allahabad high court to put a halt to this tradition. However, his plea, filed on March 18 this year was turned down, with the court saying the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the district administration, and if they did not have a problem with it, the court could not intervene.Both SP's Tanveer Khan and BSP's Mohammed Aslam have not made any promises regarding discontinuing the tradition of 'Holi ke Nawab'. Even so, the population is beginning to be polarised on the back of a rumour that the procession will be discontinued if a Muslim legislator takes control of the city.In the run up to the polls, communal differences have suddenly entered drawing room discourse even though there has been no report of an untoward incident in the district. In Dadraul assembly segment, local BJP worker RP Singh says he's heard that a cow was slaughtered in Shahbad village of Dadraul. When TOI went looking to see whether the incident actually occurred, it turned out Shahbad is across the border in Hardoi, and that such an incident was never reported even over there. Yet, the rumour mills are already spinning.BJP leader and 'Hindu Hriday Samrat' Yogi Adityanath has played his part in inflaming passions in Shahjahanpur. At an election rally in Jalalabad on the last day of campaigning, he alleged the Samajwadi Kanya Vidya Dhan scheme was only open to Muslim girls. This is factually incorrect as the scheme can be availed by all girls who have passed Class XII and belong to BPL families. But Adityanath says it with such confidence that the crowds at the rally clap in agreement. In Jalalabad, where the BSP candidate Neeraj Maurya is a frontrunner for the seat, and BJP's Manoj Kashyap trails behind the SP contender, Adityanath also rakes up the anti-Romeo squads. The Muzaffarnagar riots could have been prevented if the anti-Romeo squads existed, he says.The bitterness has spread across the length and breadth of the sugarcane producing region. At a roadside dhaba a few kilometres short of Katra assembly constituency, Nathuram Dubey says he's heard 37 cows were found dead in neighbouring Lakhimpur Kheri. It is unfortunate, he says, that parties resort to communal politics to divide people. ""This does no one any good. The politicians will disappear the day after the polls. But we must live and work together. These divisions, once created, remain forever,"" he says."

Although the district administration has been making efforts to provide jobs to the people under MNREGA, besides taking up relief work, they have been unable to stem the tide of farmers from the villages.Farmers constitute the majority of the district's population, and the failure of the monsoon has plunged the community into distress.Prakash Karishetti, a farmer in Marali village, Gangavathi taluk, told TOI that nearly 600 people in his village had moved to Bengaluru.""The population of our village is 4,000. Our village is situated on the banks of Tungabhadra, but drought has affected us badly. Most of the labourers in Marali sugar factory have moved to Kudatini and Ballari to cultivate red chillies,"" he added.Rudrappa Nittali, Kashimsab Dangi, Honnappa Kalkeri - all residents of Marali  left for Bengaluru in January, but have returned for Ugadi.""We'll go back to Bengaluru once the festival's over. We return to our villages to celebrate jatras (village fairs). We generally leave our children under the care of the elders. If they are eligible to work, we take them along once their examinations are over,"" the villagers said.President of Danapur gram panchayat, Mohammed Shafi said, ""We are asking farm labourers not to migrate to cities. Of the 1,600 jobs under MNREGA, which guarantees work for 100 days, we have just 930 job cardholders. The rest are vacant because people haven't come forward to avail of the facility.""Pointing out that provisions would be made to offer fresh jobs from April 1 by utilising funds earmarked for 2017-18, Shafi added, ""Our rural development and panchayat raj department assistant executive engineer has directed us to ensure maximum employment to prevent migration.""Chandrashekhar Tegginamani, a teacher in Yelburga, said that around 15 to 20 people hired jeeps or other such large vehicles and left the village. ""Since it's hard to carry more luggage on buses, they are hiring jeeps, which cost less as well,"" he said.President of the Tungabhadra Ulisi Andolan Samiti Vitthappa Gorantli, however, attributed the large-scale migration to the failure of MNREGA. ""Owing to the negligence of officials and politicians, MNREGA has not been implemented efficiently. Due to the delay involved in payment of wages, people have lost their hope and are going to cities in search of greener pastures. The district administration should ensure that the people are utilised fully,"" Gorantli added.NEKRTC buses see mad rushDivisional controller for North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC), Koppal division, B Borayya said that most people boarding the buses at Kushtagi and Gangavathi taluks were headed for Mangaluru. ""On the other hand, those in Yelburga are mainly bound for Bengaluru. We have formed teams to arrange non-stop buses. If we receive requests from two to three neighbouring villages, we will arrange for people to be picked up directly from the respective village and subsequently drop them wherever they want in Mangaluru. We will not levy extra charge on luggage,"" Borayya said.Minister calls for actionAt a drought review meeting conducted on March 18, rural development and panchayat raj minister HK Patil instructed officials to pay MNREGA wages within a fortnight after the work's completion. He further told them that failure to comply with the directive would see the wages hiked by 0.05%  the additional sum being paid from the penalty collected from officials responsible for the delay.""Officials should make arrangements for drinking water if the number of people involved in the project exceeds 100. If the number of children on the site exceeds five, the administration should employ somebody to look after them, in addition to deploying government doctors,"" Patil told officials at the meeting."

Karaikal district, which on an average receives 986mm rainfall annually, during northeast monsoon received a meager 283mm rainfall.Puducherry district which receives an average rainfall of 1,323mm received just 637mm. The crops - mostly paddy and sugarcane - raised in more than 8,000 hectares have been affected by the drought, he said.The loss has been estimated to a tune of 100 crore, he said, and urged the Union government to send a central team to assess the extent of damage of crops due to drought and extend drought assistance at the earliest.Earlier, while responding to a plea of AIADMK legislature party leader A Anbalagan, Narayanasamy said the government will install a bronze statue for the late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa in Puducherry. He said the government will soon form a committee to select an ideal site for installing the statue.Tabling a resolution, Narayanasamy paid rich tribute to the late AIADMK leader. He said her bold approach and actions in any front and podium always centered on the welfare and progression of the Tamil people.Recalling his association with her, he said she played a major role in clearing the impasse in inaugurating the Kudankulam nuclear power project.

In the manifesto, the party has promised to provide employment in each household under 'Ek Parivar, Ek Rozgar' programme, a house for every poor, 2kg desi ghee and 5kg sugar for 'blue card' holders, free education till PhD for daughters of 'blue card' holders, loans for education of youth, rapid VAT-refunding process for industrialists, and implementation of the goods and services tax.Jaitley said while a lot of development had already taken place in Punjab under the SAD-BJP government in the past 10 years, the alliance was committed towards economic and social strengthening of the state. ""When there is a coalition government, then programmes too are unified. Hence, keeping in mind the economic and social development of Punjab, we have come up with unified programmes in our manifesto. Our priority will be to carry forward works initiated by the coalition. Policies would be carved out for economic upliftment of Dalits, backward classes and weaker sections, so that we move towards the social strengthening,"" he said.When asked if demonetisation would be a poll plank of the alliance in Punjab and pointed out that BJP minster Anil Joshi had reportedly been telling people during his campaigning in Amritsar that he should not be blamed for demonetisation, Jaitley said more than 75% of people had appreciated demonetisation, and it was actually the foundation for the economic strengthening of the country. ""This drive which has been initiated to weed out corruption and black money will show results in coming months in the form of economic expansion of the country. Taxation will be simplified after implementation of GST from July 1,"" he said.The Union minister later addressed a gathering in Ludhiana. Attacking the Congress, he said the party had lost its stronghold in many states and had started bending over backwards for an alliance with state parties, referring to its alliance with Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh.Jaitley, who was on a whirlwind tour of the city to meet party workers, asked party workers to work hard and ensure the victory of SAD-BJP candidates from the district.Jaitley said the Congress, which was the largest party in the country, was now confined to five states. ""In the forthcoming elections, it will be wiped out from Manipur and Uttarakhand,"" he said.He added that the Congress was in such a bad condition that it was ready for any kind of alliance for a handful of seats.

The high court had reserved its decision in the matter on December 13, 2016 after conducting final hearing in a slew of writ petitions filed by petitioner VM Singh on behalf of Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangathan. The decision is expected to be delivered before January 26.According to petitioner V M Singh, the provisions of UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 and Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 relate to levy of interest applicable to sugar mills in case the cane price is not paid to farmers within 14 days from the date of physical supply of produce to mills. However, these provisions were made ineffective by state government which decided to waive this interest to be paid by mill owners. The government had claimed this was being done to ensure that mills continued to function, and long term interest of farmers were protected.While talking with TOI on phone, Singh said due to the state governments waiver, sugar mills were freed from their liability to pay interest to cane growers for crushing year 2012-13 and 2013-14 on May 19, 2015 and for crushing year 2014-15 in October 2016. The amount of this interest added up to nearly Rs 2,100 crore, he added.As his two petitions were already pending with HC for decision on cane pricing as well as rights of cane growers, Singh challenged the interest waiver decision of the state government by filing an amendment application in the HC in August, 2016.In this application, it was argued that the farmers had been forced to seek loans from banks to meet their financial requirements in cases of untimely payment of their cane price from sugar mills. As they were made to pay interest on respective loans at assigned rate, they had full right of getting interest on their held up or delayed sugarcane payments at the rate of 15% per annum in accordance with the provisions of Sugarcane Control Order, Singh explained.The petitioner said HC was to decide the powers of the state government to waive interest and was likely to deliver a judgment soon."

I lost 17 kilos in 10 months, my haemoglobin levels fell to 7, I had abdominal pains and I lost appetite. I was readying for a spine surgery when a doctor suggested I consult a toxicologist.

""Innocents in jail will be released after scrutiny,"" she added as the gathering clapped.The BSP has traditionally never released a manifesto for any of the elections it has fought. In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati had dis missed manifestos of other parties as ""nothing but tall claims"", saying her party believed in doing ""real development work"" instead for the people. This year, however, the party had taken to social media to highlight the points they would be focusing on in the 2017 UP elections. As usual, they hadn't released a party manifesto though.Dubbing the BJP ""anti-Dalits"", Mayawati warned people that the Union government would discontinue reservation for SCs and STs. Addressing an election rally in Aligarh, she claimed that she had ""information"" that the Union government was contemplating ending reservations. She said a vote for BJP in UP would be a vote to end reservations. For good measure, she asked Muslims to stay away from the Congress-SP alliance. Alluding to the law and order situation in UP, which BJP, too, is talking about in its rallies, Mayawati said, ""BSP will start a special drive for victims who could not file FIRs during the SP rule in UP.

We will jail those who have illegally occupied land given to farmers on lease.""The BSP chief said that in place of SP's ""ghatiya"" (bad) mid-day meal, her government will provide cake, milk, biscuits and fruits to students. ""The quality of food being provided will be taken care of.""Repeating her previous promise, Mayawati said she will ensure cash is given to the poor according to their needs ""and not laptops and cellphones that other parties are promising"". The former chief mini ster, who has been criticised for the statues of elephants - her party symbol - that she put up in Lucknow and other parts of UP, said no such statues would be constructed ""as that work has already been done"".Raising the exodus issue, Mayawati slammed both the SP-Congress combine and BJP. ""The biggest exodus was during the Congress rule when after Independence the maximum number of people left UP in search of employment. In SP rule, people migrated from UP due to bad law and order situation. And with BJP at the centre, many were forced to go out in search of jobs to save their demonetisation-hit, starving families."""

And like multigrain and brown bread have replaced white bread, organic vegetables have taken the place of regular greens, so too for juices. Sipping fruity drinks out of a can or making them in conventional juicers at home is so yesterday. For the health-conscious crowd, the latest dietary must-have is cold-pressed juices. So why are cold-pressed juices so good for you? Because they are prepared through a process in which no heat is generated  unlike in conventional juicing techniques  the juice itself preserves more of the nutrients and natural goodness of the fruit or vegetable (see box). What's more, apart from the regular orange, apple and guava, cold-pressed juices are available in many exotic varieties  chia seeds, celery, collard, wheatgrass, courgettes, mangosteen, kiwi and more.When we asked nutritionist Hena Nafis about the efficacy of cold-pressed juices, this is what she told us, ""Juicing as a trend is a western concept and has become popular in India over the years. The best part about cold-pressed juices is that they are high on anti-oxidants, but consuming a lot of these juices is not good. Since it may contain so many vegetables and fruits, it is heavy on the stomach. I don't prescribe it to my patients who want to lose weight.""While the demand for cold-pressed juices has been late in coming to Kolkata, we now have two entrepreneurs who are spearheading the movement to make people aware of their products. Their line of juices are supplied to gyms, supermarkets and are also delivered to homes. We met Ashna Chhaochharia , the founder and owner of Pure Haus , which specialises in cold-pressed juices. She said, ""I started my company in May, 2016. Initially, I was a bit sceptical about the concept of cold-pressed juices in Kolkata since the market is yet to open up in comparison with other metros like Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore. There, people are more health conscious. Because of a fast lifestyle, people are always on the go, and taking these juices helps to keep the stomach full for a long time. Even my friends, who stay abroad, rave about the goodness of cold-pressed juices. That's when I decided to introduce it to my city. It's not easyintegrating the required amount of vegetables and fruits in your diet if you have a busy schedule. Our products take care of the daily dose of unadulterated nourishment.""Ashna functions with a team of seven members  three of them are part of the production process, one person does the deliveries to gyms and homes, while the other three look after the social media marketing. Pure Haus has different ranges of juices that cater to specific needs. For instance, her cleanse packs can be used for detox, which comes at a price of Rs 1,500, then there are single bottles of juices with various concoctions of orange, beetroot, apple, pineapple, along with imported superfoods like kale, fennel bulb and bee pollen. Each of these bottles is priced between `150-170 for every Rs 250 ml and Rs 250-275 for the 500 ml ones. Apart from that, one can also opt for vegan milk and two types of cashew milks  one with cinnamon, vanilla and honey and the other with Japanese matcha green tea (excellent for weight loss, cancer prevention and lowering bad cholesterol). Abhishek Jhunjhunwala , who runs the other cold-pressed juice brand in town, InSpirit Cleanse , agreed with Ashna that cold-pressed juices have come to Kolkata much later than other cities. Also, since Kolkata is a price conscious market, there are fewer takers for these juices here, since they are not exactly dirt cheap. ""Fitness freaks are aware of the goodness of these juices but then again, their number is not very high. The awareness is a little higher among women aged between 18 and 40. At a time when health ailments are plaguing almost everyone and good habits are gradually getting lost, it is time we take corrective measures to keep ourselves fit. We have held several sampling sessions in supermarkets and people are very keen about the products and awareness is likely to rise in the coming years. But one should also keep in mind that consuming juices or having a healthy diet alone will not help a person to stay fit. Regular workouts are also a must,"" said Abhishek.According to him, sales have gown over the past year. Initially, his brand would sell 15-20 bottles a day, but now the numbers have increased to 200-250 bottles per day. Monthly subscription packages are also on the rise. Since juices are generally consumed after the morning workout, he ensures home deliveries to clients by 7 am. ""I believe we are selling a habit and not a product. Since, we are all addicted to packaged juice and the sugar content in them is very high, it's not good for us. Thus, we brought in the technology for preparing cold-pressed juices, along with nutritionists and dieticians from the USA on board, to create different products that are best suited for Indian markets,"" shared Abhishek.InSpirit Cleanse also has three juice carts  two in the Salt Lake and Sector V area and another one at Park Street  to reach out to new customers and raise awareness levels about the product. The bottles in these carts are priced at Rs 50-80 for every 200 ml. Their range of products covers specific requirements like detox plans for beauty, weight loss, general body fatigue, indigestion and heart diseases, among others."

He said that the state government has taken a number of steps to promote cashless transactions.""We have a network of 17,250 PDS shops,"" Das said. ""They are equipped with computers and internet devices and are doing transactions after biometric authentication.""He further said that the state government had gone for AEP as it is easy and does not require any commission or rental from customers or shopkeepers.""The customer just has to give his Aadhaar number, select his bank's name and give his thumb impression,"" Das said. ""The customer is thus autheniticated and the desired amount is transferred from his account for payments.""Gujarat has partnered with common service centres (CSC), a special purpose vehicle of the ministry of electronics and IT to offer these services. Das said that to transfer money, CSC's software, DIGIPay, is being used. There is no need for any card or PIN number.Das further said that in Gujarat, almost 80 lakh out of 120 lakh families will benefit from AEP system every month. ""It has generated very good response from the people,"" he said."

Baben was declared the best village in the state when Bhavesh Patel was its sarpanch in 2010-11. And this year, his wife Falguni Patel has been elected sarpanch of the village. What is so special about a couple becoming sarpanch of a village? This is a common question of people. The speciality lies in their dream of bringing about social development in their village, which they had nurtured during their courtship of two years until 1993 when they got married.In 1991 when they were studying in a college in Bardoli, Bhavesh and Falguni fell in love and decided to get married. However, there was stiff opposition from their families. Bhavesh and Falguni told their parents they will not marry anyone else and would wait for their consent which finally came in 1993. During this two years, they wove dreams for all-round development of Baben that had a population of 7,000, which now has grown to 15,600.On the day of their marriage, Bhavesh and Falguni took an oath to bring about social development in Baben with love. Bhavesh said, ""We love our village and so decided to make it best in Gujarat. Our motto was to have all the facilities of a city in Baben, but people continue to lead a simple life of village without losing our age-old values.""Bhavesh achieved his aim in 2010-11 when Baben was declared the best village in the state.""I learnt social service from my husband. He organizes many events to raise money for poor. We never neglect them. We have built a hospital in the village and it will be inaugurated soon. Baben already had good roads, electricity, water supply and school,"" Falguni, who is also director of Uka-Tarsadia Credit Society , said.Bhavesh is Bardoli taluka BJP president and vice-chairman of Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Society . He also runs Kanya Vidyalaya The couple says like on all previous Valentine's Day, this time too their love remains Baben only."

Their demand also included waiving of all crop loans borrowed by the farmers irrespective of cooperative and nationalised banks.The farmers demanded that Rs 10 lakh be handed over to the family members of the farmers who had lost their lives following crop failure which was caused due to shortage of water. Another demand was an action plan to overcome drinking water scarcity across the state.While demanding the number of days for MGNREGS should be increased as 200 days and wages as Rs 400, they also stressed the need that the work should be handed over to agriculture labourers who are idle as they have lost their employment opportunity due to crop failure.Meanwhile, similar protests were held at Samayapuram Tollgate, Manapparai, Musiri and few other places in Trichy district and police arrested over 200 in the district.

Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Tuesday showed retail inflation as measured by the consumer price index rose an annual 3.65% in February, faster than previous month's 3.17% rise, which was the slowest pace in more than five years.Separate data released by the commerce and industry ministry showed the wholesale price index rose an annual 6.55% in February, rising from previous month's 5.25% increase. This was the highest in more than three years.The difference between CPI and WPI, which was 25 basis points in November 2016 increased to 290 basis points in February 2017. Since December 2016, WPI inflation is more than CPI inflation, according to estimates by SBI . In both sets of data, some food prices such as sugar and confectionery showed signs of firming up, although prices of vegetables and pulses declined.Economists said prospects of a rate cut remain muted.""Nevertheless, likelihood of a repo rate cut by the RBI in April 2017 remains subdued, given its focus on bringing inflation to 4% in a durable manner. In fact, CPI inflation is expected to rise to above 4.5% in March 2017, as the base effect continues to unwind and prices of perishables track a seasonal uptrend,"" said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency Icra . She said month-on-month rise in food prices was muted in both CPI and WPI, dampened by the continued correction in prices of pulses, on the back of healthy production estimates for FY2017.""WPI inflation recorded a much sharper uptick in February 2017 relative to the sequential rise in CPI inflation. Some of the factors that led to the spike in WPI inflation are not part of CPI basket, for instance commodities such as crude oil and coal,"" said Nayar.Economists said the future trend of retail inflation would be guided by how vegetable prices move. ""We expect FY18 average CPI inflation at 4.8%,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, State Bank of India. ""We therefore expect RBI to hold rates in the first bi-monthly policy statement for 2017-18,"" he said."

Since goats can survive on even thorny plants, it will be easy to find food for the animal.""The group members have said that a goat costs around Rs 3,000, the families can even sell the goats' offspring and earn additional money from it. For the project, the group has raised money from their friends and their own salaries.The cash crunch situation delayed the distribution of the goats. ""The people from whom we are going to buy the goats want the payment in cash. Since the donations that we had received was deposited in bank, we will now have to first withdraw the money and then make the payments,"" Shendre told TOI.Apart from this project and installing the bore wells, the group had given kits comprising household essentials like rice, edible oil, sugar, grams and a pair of saris to widows and abandoned elderly women in 2015."

The day is regarded as the beginning of an auspicious phase in Indian culture, known as the 'holy phase of transition'.Different communities in the city will celebrate the day in unique ways. Maharashtrians will celebrate it with greetings of 'Tilgul ghya, goad goad bola' and kite flying, while Tamil families will observe Pongal with kolam decorations outside their homes and a special sweet named after the festival itself. Magh or Bhogali Bihu will be celebrated among the Assamese, who dedicate the festival to Agni, or the Lord of Fire.Across homes, sweets made using jaggery, sesame and groundnut will dominate food platters, typical for the winter season and designed to help the body cope with the harsh cold.Men and women usually wear black-coloured clothes on this day, which is of particular significance not just for the newborn in the family, but also married women, who indulge in much socializing and the exchange of 'haldi-kunku', sugad (small earthen-pots filled with strands of wheat, chickpeas, jaggery, sugar cane pieces, 'ber' and til gul laddoos) with other women, besides distributing vaan (small utility gifts).

The world's No.1 sugar producer is projected to ship an all-time high of 27.8 million tonnes of the sweetener this year.All grain and sugar arriving at Tiplam comes by rail, which is unusual in Brazil where more than 75 percent of cargo is transported by truck.VLI built two transshipment points in Uberaba in Minas Gerais state for grains, and Guara in Sao Paulo state for sugar, where trucks discharge their cargos into wagons.Global commodities traders such as Bunge Ltd, Cargill Inc, Louis Dreyfus and Archer Daniels Midland Co already operate terminals in Santos. But Gama is unconcerned by the competition.""At first we thought our project would be used mainly by traders lacking a physical position in Santos. But surprisingly we are receiving orders from everybody,"" he said, adding that large traders were using the new facility to boost their volumes beyond their own terminals.

""If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.""Trump has in the past excoriated drugmakers for charging ""astronomical"" prices, while acknowledging how ""complicated"" the nation's healthcare system is.Representatives of the Trump administration could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday on whether the president believes the treatment price for Pompe disease is fair.Trump's comments on Tuesday night highlight an issue central to the industry and investors - the potential for deregulation of the FDA, the agency charged with approving pharmaceutical products.""I think Trump used this example somewhat cynically as a way of trying to advance the deregulatory agenda,"" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School. ""The FDA's standards actually promote innovation because patients don't want just any old drug - they want drugs that work.""Megan's father, John Crowley, now chief executive at Amicus Therapeutics Inc, started a biotech company in 1998 to seek a treatment for Pompe disease.In 2006, the FDA - after a nine-month review - approved infused enzyme replacement therapy Myozyme for patients born with the condition. A similar drug, Lumizyme, was approved in 2010 for late-onset Pompe disease and is now used regardless of a patient's age.The average annual cost of treatment is $298,000, according to Paris-based Sanofi SA, which now owns the drugs.Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, drugs for rare diseases - defined as those that treat fewer than 200,000 patients - are given a range of incentives including seven years of marketing exclusivity.""Pharmaceutical companies know they get a free pass for very expensive drugs for orphan diseases, whereas they don't for mainstream diseases,"" said Joel Hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the University of Southern California.The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) applauded Trump's recognition, but disagreed with the idea that the regulatory process needs an overhaul.""Our patients deserve the same quality therapies as everyone else, and to weaken the standards will only threaten our population with unsafe, ineffective therapies,"" NORD said in a statement on Wednesday.Pompe disease, affecting 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide, prevents the body from making enough of an enzyme used by heart and muscle cells to convert a form of sugar called glycogen into energy. When glycogen builds up in these cells it can lead to disability and death.NORD estimates that around 30 million Americans suffer from 7,000 rare diseases.

Homemakers too have high hopes and expectations attached to the upcoming budget. They are looking forward to more reliefs in day-to-day essentials.Demonetisation came as a bad omen for many, including homemakers, who had to reveal their hidden savings to their family and deposit the scrapped notes in the bank from their piggybanks concealed in kitchen wardrobe. However, women now want the government to give them their dues by reducing the prices of essential commodities, such as milk and its products, oil and other fast moving consumer goods.Suman Maheshwari, a resident of Exhibition Road, said she was expecting some relief for homemakers in the budget. ""Prices of milk, bread, sugar and other important food items have skyrocketed and our saving has become negligible,"" she said. Asked how much she managed to save in the current financial year, Maheshwari said, ""Not even 10% of what I used to save five years back. With the small savings, homemakers like me purchase home appliances and gadgets."" She added that the government should make allocations for improving civic amenities besides giving a fillip to the education sector. Another homemaker, Mala Jha, echoed Maheshwari's tone.Saumya Prasad, employee of a private firm at Nala Road, whose annual income is Rs 3.75 lakh, said the income tax slab should be increased to at least Rs 4 lakh. ""In his speech after demonetisation, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley had said that the move would give tax relief to the honest taxpayers. The salaried people are the most honest ones when it comes to paying tax. Now it his Jaitley's turn to fulfil his promise,"" Prasad added.Since going to salon, spa and restaurant has become an expensive affair, majority of women, especially young ones, said they were expecting some relief in service tax. Alamganj resident Mahira Jahan , 22, said she used to go to restaurants and salons frequently along with her friends, but such outings have become a costly affair now.

She was 10 when she was told: ""Aapko sugar ho gaya hai"" (you have acquired diabetes) and that her body had stopped producing insulin.The disease has no cure and the teen has to be on insulin for the rest of her life. ""It was shocking. But I accepted the reality. We got a glucometer on the advice of a doctor. I do not like it because it is very expensive and is a burden on my parents,"" said Shalini.With no government programme to assist, parents of such children are just about managing type-I diabetes. Unlike normal diabetes, there is no predisposition to type-I diabetes, explained New Delhi-based endocrinologist, Dr Rajiv Singla. He was speaking on the sidelines of a free diabetes screening camp at a clinic in Arera Colony here on Sunday.""Insulin is a key hormone that our body needs to make use of carbohydrates. Without insulin, blood glucose cannot go into the muscles. In patients with type-I diabetes, there is no insulin production within the body. Awaiting a scientific breakthrough, a patient with type-I diabetes has to be managed through insulin.""As such, the condition alters a child's life. The economic and psychological impact -- even on the family -- cannot be underestimated, Dr Singla said. Providing a balancing act is not limited to use of insulin. Not just parents, schools too are not prepared. ""We carried out an orientation programme in a private school recently. None of the teachers was aware if any of students in their school was a type-I diabetic,"" said GMC assistant professor and DM (endocrinology), Dr Sachin Chittawar.""Counselling is key to management of type 1 diabetes. Some parents are reluctant to inform their school about their child's condition. Furthermore, schools too need to be proactive in helping children with the condition,"" said Dr Chittawar.Around 130 patients attended the camp wherein patients were tested for HBA1c, thyroid profile, lipid profile and blood sugar.

If farmers were interested in the breeds, the department carries out artificial insemination, said Dr T Manoharan, specialist attached to the regional joint director office of the animal husbandry department, Vellore. He was responding to farmers during the farmers' grievance meeting held at Vellore collectorate on Friday.The farmers urged the government to give subsidy for rearing native cattle breeds. "" Native breeds like Kangeyam can pull carts with four tonnes of weight, but the crossbreed and Jersey breed cannot pull even one tonne. The milk from the crossbreed is also not good for health. Hence the government should support farmers rearing native breed financially,"" said a farmer at the meeting.The farmers have also said that native breeds would help organic farming. ""Tamil Nadu launched oestrous synchronisation of indigenous cows programme in October last year to conserve native cattle breeds. There are several other programmes devised by the central and state governments to preserve indigenous breeds,"" said Dr Manoharan.The farmers also urged the district administration to remove 'Seemai Karuvelam' trees from water bodies. ""The species has grown in large numbers in government Navlock coconut farm and agriculture farm. It is badly affecting the agriculture activities and the yield of coconut trees. The district administration should take immediate steps to uproot Seemai Karuvelam trees from the government farms and also from water bodies,"" said L C Mani, a farmer.Mani also claimed that the PWD department has been planning to open a sand quarry on the Palar riverbed near the government farm near Ranipet. It would affect agriculture activities in the surrounding areas.

The farmers have also urged the authorities to waive the interest of the loans they availed for raising sugarcane during this period.Officials of the Cooperative Sugar Mills said that the government has assured to release funds to disburse a part of the pending money to the farmers. ""We have been asking for Rs 14 crore from the government to settle the pending amount to the farmers. We will disburse the amount by February,"" said an official from a Vellore sugar mill."

Riding on Modi-wave and changed dynamics in the wake of Muzaffarngar riots, the party had a clean sweep in the region in 2014 elections.At stake is fortune of 12 Lok Sabha members who cover 73 assembly constituencies that are going to polls in the first phase. In all, three Union ministers -Dr Mahesh Sharma, Gen VK Singh and Sanjeev Baliyan and one former Union minister Prof Ramshanker Katheria -will have to prove their prowess in their respective regions.The party's stake is highest also because not only would fortunes of prominent leaders get sealed, majority of the contentious issues barring Ram temple have direct are associated with this region. Issues in the BJP manifesto include closure of slaughterhouses, illegal and modern, constituion of anti-Romeo squad, triple talaq, Kairana exodus, sugarcane dues, etc. Almost all these issues have a direct connect with the voters of the region going to poll in the first phase.The party had already asked its MPs to ensure winning at least three Vidhan Sabha constituencies. Party insiders said ticket distribution during Lok Sabha election 2019 will take into consideration performance during assembly elections. Coming to the list of MPs, fortunes of Kairana MP Hukkum Singh, Satyapal Singh, Rajveer Singh `Raju Bhaiyya', Etah MP and son of Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh and others would also be sealed in the EVMs on February 11, when polling is held for the first phase.Also at stake are fortunes of former UP BJP chief Laxmikant Bajpayi, whose supporters even see him as a potential chief minister and post-Muzaffarnagar riot pro-Hindutva faces of the party--Sardhana MLA Sangeet Singh Som and Thana Bhawan MLA Suresh Rana. Also at stake are fortunes of national secretary and media in charge Shrikant Sharma, who is trying his luck from Mathura.The sailing this time for the BJP is not as smooth as it was during 2014 elections. Jats switched loyalilty from their traditional party Rashtriya Lok Dal during Lok Sabha polls and so did Jatavs from the Bahujan Samaj Party . But the scenario has changed drastically since then. RLD is upbeat that it has managed to gain confidence of Jats while Mayawati is confident of winning over Dalit-Muslim combination this time. Wary of the fact, BJP sent Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath to campaign here. Yogi's star appeal in the region is alo at stake. BJP won 11 seats in west UP in 2012 polss but it is eyeing over 50% of the 73 seats this time."

Demonetisation and a crisis in the sugar industry are being cited as reasons for the same.A senior bank official told TOI that since there was absolutely no response to the proposal, a fresh attempt to offload the cooperative sugar factories. ""We had issued an advertisement for the sale of machinery and land measuring 2,200 acres, but there are no takers,"" he said.Elaborating on the sale of immovable and movable properties in terms of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, the official said the bank has called for separate tenders for each sugar factory for sale of machinery and land. ""We have fixed the reserved price at Rs 473 crore. Once the offers are received, they are evaluated by a high-level committee. We had no option, but to reject all the offers since they were much below the reserved price,"" he said.A state cooperation department official said an attempt was made to sell the land to some leading industrial houses as well as the state-run industrial development corporation, but there was no response on the grounds that there is no policy to procure land by a tendering process.Most of the cooperative sugar factories are directly or indirectly controlled by leading politicians, mostly belonging to Congress or NCP. ""The state cooperative bank was directly controlled by NCP, as a result, loans were disbursed quite liberally and it was not evaluated if there will be repayment within the stipulated period,"" he said.In the wake of a key report of the Reserve Bank of India and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan had appointed veteran bureaucrats to streamline the bank.

The campaign that ran between August 22 and September 5 last year reported destruction of 1.25 cannabis plants from 5,000 bighas land in Kullu.However, large numbers of cases of charas seizure have sent the authorities into a tizzy as cannabis is still being cultivated. Sources said some people are still into cannabis cultivation, while Nepalese labourers, outsiders and foreigner nationals are suspected to be funding the locals. Police said charas from other states or countries might have been brought into Kullu for further distribution in the name of Malana charas to fetch better prices.A Nepalese, identified as Tek Bahadur, was arrested on Saturday after 2.5kg charas was recovered from his possession. Police are now interrogating him to know the source and destination of the consignment. Dozens of Nepalese have been booked in recent years for carrying charas. Remote villages of Kullu, especially of Parvati valley, are notorious for charas production.Police claim that drugs other than charas like heroin, brown sugar and cocaine are being brought in by peddlers. Kullu SP Padam Chand said the Nigerian drug kingpin Oke Chikku Matthew has been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. ""He was arrested on February 13 from Delhi with 1.5kg heroin. He used to supply heroin to many places including Kullu. Police are trying to reach the main supplier and his helpers,"" the SP said.Malana cream (charas) is famous worldwide and Kerala gold (ganja) is famous in India. Oil extracted from cannabis seeds is very expensive and is used in Kullu for cooking. A US national Visvamber Isiah Streisand was arrested with 126kg ganja and over 10 litre hash oil near Naggar village of Kullu on Friday. Padam Chand said the accused is in police remand and will be produced in court on Monday."

While Maggi noodles returned to stores after five months, the category lost salience and rivals such as ITCs Sunfeast Yippee and HULs Knorr gained market share in the interim. However, the brand still has a 60% market share in instant noodles.Nestle SA has announced a series of global commitments to reduce sugars , sodium, saturated fats and trans-fats, introduce nutritious products, step up food fortification, remove artificial colours, restrict marketing to children, step up nutrition data on packs at points of sale and online, and disseminate information on portion control.The Indian unit reported a decline of 8.66% in net profit to Rs 167.3 crore in the December quarter, the fall paced by demonetisation. Edelweiss Securities wrote in a report late last month that Nestle is transforming from a bottom line focussed company to one which also lays emphasis on healthy top line growth and market share gains, with focus on innovation and brand equity. Nestle India managing director Suresh Narayanan told analysts during a post-earnings call last month that 2017 was likely to be good for the company since it is positioned for a big urban play. Earlier, the level of innovation was low, maybe because the market was not ready for the products. Now, innovation has been stepped up in a meaningful way as many matrices such as premiumisation, urbanisation, dual working families and health indulgence are favourable, Narayanan had said.Child-centric cereal brand Ceregrow, fortified with iron and fruit, and Milo health drink with less than 10% sucrose per pack are being placed in stores now. The company is working on similar options in other product categories.We are looking at fortification in our mass consumption products as well and are committed to removing artificial colours, the company spokesperson said. On the Maggi franchise, for example, the company has fortified seasoning with iron and iodine.We are providing consumers with nutrition information on food labels, guidance on daily intake for energy and key nutrients and portion guidance, the spokesperson said. By 2020, the company proposes to provide detailed product nutrition facts on its packs and eretailer sites.A statement on the Nestle website says the company will gradually increase guidance on portions through products, packs and dispensers.We will extend our guidance on portions to our consumer recipes, and relevant teenager and adult products by 2020, the statement adds. It also says that by the same year, it will remove all artificial colours from its products.Nestle has said that over 99% of fats and oils in its foods and beverages, starting January 1 this year, will not contain trans-fats across products and markets. By 2020, Nestle will reduce added sugar by 5% and sodium by 10%.The company said that by 2016-end, it had reduced added sugar by 8% and sodium by 10.5% in its foods and beverages."

""That fuels a lot of (buyout) enquiries.""The company could also pursue a public offering of its shares, he said.Soda makers PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Co are cutting sugar in their drinks while investing in low-calorie and non-soda beverages to tackle falling soda sales and the threat of taxes on sugar-sweetened drinks.The two companies have snapped up several non-soda drink makers over the last few years and are on the prowl for more.Coke launched its own stevia-sweetened drink, Coca-Cola Life, in 2014, with Pepsi following with Pepsi True the same year.Zevia holds 90 percent of the natural zero-calorie soda market in the United States, according to data from a joint study by research firms SPINS and IRI last year.Other companies that also make stevia-based drinks include Bai Brands LLC, which was snapped up by Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc for $1.7 billion last year.Zevia's revenue surpassed $100 million in 2015 and is ""rapidly approaching"" $200 million, Spence said.Spence, a Harvard Business School graduate, bought Zevia along with Northwood Ventures in 2010 from founders Derek and Jessica Newman and Ian Eisenberg for an undisclosed amount.Zevia's drinks are available at retailers such as Target Corp, Safeway, Whole Foods and on Amazon.com Inc . The Los Angeles-based company is looking to expand its distribution by selling at hospitals and convenience stores.The company is also in talks to sell its drinks at restaurants looking to add healthier menu options.""Many of them have made huge thrusts on the food side and yet with beverages, they have not so much. That's a fantastic target for us and I think you are going to see Zevia in national restaurant chains in the next couple of years,"" Spence said.

Despite working for a largely-supportive employer, help was not possible in this case, as she herself was unaware that she was suffering from postpartum depression, a type of clinical depression that affects parents right after child birth.Mental health issues like postpartum, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, phobias, body image issues like bulimia, anorexia are on the increase at the workplace and pyschologists say today's offices are not yet equipped to identify the symptoms. Companies like Coca-Cola, Titan, Mondelez and Aspire Systems have taken strides to help troubled employees by offering complete anonymity and direct access to psychiatrists.

We've even seen cases where employees have anxiety attacks fearing marriage,"" said Dinesh Kumar T K, director HR, Aspire Systems.Complete anonymity is another draw for staffers as they get quality, free counselling. At Coca-Cola India, employees have access to a global helpline and offline support for de-addiction from nicotine, alcohol or food. Titan and Aspire also have a system, where confidentiality of the person seeking assistance is maintained. Invoices for the sessions are raised by the counsellor with minimal details such as time spent to protect their identity. ""We have regular review meetings with the counsellor to understand if we could help any of our people. Identities get revealed only if they have a problem in the workplace,"" added Kumar of Aspire Systems.Mental health experts, who advice corporates, say there are inherent challenges while helping employees. For instance, an employee suffering from postpartum depression would stand to better benefit from counselling, when they take joint sessions along with their spouse. ""Also, in a country like India, we look to family for support first. Corporates need to take that extra step to encourage employees to come out. It should not be another 'tick in the box' program,"" added Nazareth.Ends"

The third advance estimates prepared by the Directorate of Statistics and Economics of Telangana (DSE) gave a rosy picture in the coming days.After two years of severe drought across the state, farmers in the state have gone for a full-scale of cultivation, first time since the bifurcation. This has resulted in higher ayacut under the cultivation followed by a sharp increase in the production of foodgrains against the normal production of 77.59 lakh tonnes. ""Bumper crop is expected this year giving much needed relief to farmers. We are expecting a record food grain production followed by an impressive growth rate in the farm sector. The third advanced studies already indicated higher production for major crops"", finance minister Etala Rajender said.This was attributed to increase in the area under cultivation. Total foodgrains cultivation area in the state has gone up to 32.99 lakh hectares as against 21.80 lakh hectares in 2015-16, an increase of 51.33% over previous year. Paddy cultivation in the state has gone up to 17.10 lakh hectares, an increase of 6.64 lakh hectares, compared to 10.46 lakh hectares in the previous year, an increase of 63.48% over previous year. Rice and maize are the main foodgrain crops which together accounted for 93.42% of the total production during 2015-16.According to DSE estimates, the total foodgrains production would be 90.59 lakh tonnes, an increase in 39.14 lakh tonnes, compared to last year's production of 51.45 lakh tonnes. Similarly, rice production in the state is estimated at 55.59 lakh tonnes, an increase of 25.12 lakh tonnes, compared to last year's production of 30.47 lakh tonnes.Maize, red gram, cotton, sugarcane crops also estimated an impressive growth in both ayacut and production giving an impetus to the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP).This was attributed to increase in the area under cultivation.

The company launched a C$19 ($14.23) a month program to serve customers who do not live in the north, allowing them to choose a phone number with an area code from anywhere in Canada.Ice Wireless had argued that Sugar users were accessing the Rogers' network on an incidental basis as its service is provided primarily through wi-fi.But the CRTC ruled that the company had improperly allowed Sugar users to ""obtain permanent rather than incidental"" access to Rogers' cell network.Advocacy group OpenMedia said on Wednesday the CRTC's decision effectively paralyzes Sugar and called for a review of rules around smaller companies roaming on established providers' networks.Samer Bishay, Chief Executive of Ice Wireless and Sugar Mobile, said he was disappointed and would review the decision in detail before deciding the company's next steps.The CRTC gave Sugar 50 days to stop using Rogers' network. For now, customers will be able to use Sugars' service uninterrupted, Bishay said.David Watt, senior vice-president of regulatory affairs at Rogers, said the company was pleased with the decision.""This was about violating a roaming agreement, plain and simple,"" Watt said.Critics say that the cost of phone services are kept high due to the fact that Canada's telecom landscape is dominated by just three large companies - Rogers, BCE Inc and Telus Corp.""This decision is very bad news for long-suffering wireless customers,"" OpenMedia's Katy Anderson said in a statement.($1 = C$1.3348) (Reporting by Leah Schnurr; editing by Diane Craft)"

The CAG report on public sector undertakings was tabled in the legislature on Friday.Sahitya Ratna Lokshahir Anna Bhau Sathe Development Corporation Ltd (SRLABSDCL), which was formed for the Matang community's development, gave loans to the tune of Rs 35.34 crore to two companies, Maitari Sugar and Trading Pvt Ltd for business operations and Mahalaxmi Dairy Products Cooperative Ltd for cluster development. In both cases, the beneficiaries did not belong to the Matang community. ""Investigations into the disbursement of funds in these cases are being conducted,"" reads the report.Loans to the tune of Rs 104 crore were disbursed to three entities in 2014. In two cases, the then SRLABSDCL chairman granted loans to firms where he had a stake. In one case, a loan was given to the brother of the then SRLABSDCL chairman.""The disbursement was directly and indirectly benefitting the then chairman,"" read the report. Under the SRLABSDCL a sum of Rs 7 lakh can be given to individuals for the purchase of tourist vehicles. But during July-October 2014, six district offices gave Rs 10.14 crore loans to people to buy 64 vehicles, which included luxury vehicles like Mercedes Benz and Audi. The cost of vehicles was much higher than the Rs 7 lakh cap. ""The documents and the names of beneficiaries to whom the loans were disbursed didn't match in some cases. This case too is being investigated by the agencies, "" reads the report.Financial assistance under the SRLABSDCL's Mahila Samrudhi Scheme was meant for women of the targeted community, but the audit revealed that Rs 30.5 lakh aid was extended to 60 male beneficiaries by the Mumbai district office.The corporation disbursed Rs 2.93 crore loans to 178 beneficiaries who did not meet the income criterion. In 14 cases, the same income certificates were used by multiple beneficiaries. The age-criterion norm was violated by the corporation while doling out loans. The corporation has maintained record books of the transactions. The audit also revealed that four district managers had withdrawn Rs 47.83 crore in cash between 2014-2015 from the corporation's bank accounts. The four officials transferred Rs 7.35 crore into the bank accounts of private parties through internet banking.""Documents for withdrawals and transfers are unavailable,"" said the report."

He has submitted a proposed action plan to the Prime Minister to deal with problems facing the agricultural sector in the country.V M Singh submitted the proposal, which discusses the problems in the agricultural loan policy, agricultural pricing structure, murky conditions of produce procurement and delayed payment of dues. It also suggests reforms to address these issues.Singh, national convener of Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Party, told TOI, Farmers normally seek agricultural loans when their entire produce is not procured by the government agencies under target-based system or they are not provided with timely payments of their crops as is evident in case of sugarcane. Such conditions create scarcity of liquidity for making agricultural investments as well as meeting their household expenditures.Quoting the specific example of Pilibhit district, Singh said that the total wheat cultivation area during the current Rabi season was 1.55 lakh hectares. This area is likely to produce at least 7.75 lakh metric tonnes of wheat in the district, while the state government has fixed the total current procurement target at 3.70 lakh metric tonnes, he said.The produce of numbers of farmers is rejected by procurement agencies due to excess moisture and foreign materials. These conditions deprive almost half of the total farmers of an opportunity to sell their crop on government announced support price and they consequently are left to the mercy of private traders, Singh said.The farmer leader said that he had therefore proposed to the PM to withdraw the target-based procurement system and to make state governments to purchase entire agriculture produce of farmers to save them from harassment.Singh said that in 2015, UP had witnessed 1,153 deaths of farmers due to suicides and shock as untimely rain and hailstorm had massively decimated Rabi crops. But the farmers were not given reparation against crop damages as in most of the cases the Kisan Credit Card issuing banks had been found defaulters in depositing the crop insurance premium with insurance companies.Once the KCC loan is linked directly to the loss of crops, the farmers will be able to get compensation without fail and thus to sustain themselves even if their crops are destroyed due to reasons beyond their control, Singh said.Regarding 50 million farmer families which survive on sugarcane crop, Singh proposed to the PM to re-impose penal interest payment system on sugar mills under which the mills were liable to pay 15% interest to farmers if payment of sugarcane was made beyond 14 days of the supply of cane to mills. Although an order to this effect had been passed by the Allahabad high court the state government revoked it by a cabinet decision, Singh said."

The BJP-led government's alliance partner, Shiv Sena , which had joined the protests in the run-up to the budget, back-tracked and cooperated during the budget presentation.The opposition has dismissed the farm allocation as misleading. ""These so-called allocations to the farm sector are nothing but financial jugglery. The budget is hugely disappointing to farmers,"" said NCP's Dhananjay Munde ""A farm loan waiver will require Rs 30,500 crore, and there is no guarantee the farmer will be out of debt for good. Instead we are investing in the farm sector,"" countered CM Devendra Fadnavis. He said the state had also approached the Centre to help in extending institutional credit to farmers who had defaulted on loans.Within the budget's farm sector spend, the main focus is irrigation. The budget allocates Rs 8,233 crore to the water resources department and Rs 1,200 crore for the state's water conservation scheme, the Jalyukta Shivar Yojana. An allocation of Rs 2,812 crore has been made under the PM's Krishi Sinchai Yojana. Another Rs 225 crore has been set aside for its wells and farm ponds scheme and Rs 250 crore for Marathwada's irrigation. A sum of Rs 100 crore has been allocated to micro-irrigation schemes in Vidarbha and Rs 979 crore towards agricultural pumps. In order to boost farm income, the budget has set aside Rs 200 crore to set up Farmer Producer Companies for group farming and marketing.Given that Goods and Service Tax (GST) is expected to be introduced from July 1, the state government has not introduced any new taxes, nor proposed an increase in taxes, except for liquor and tax on lottery.Tax on lotteries which are payable by organisers stands increased by Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Liquor is out of the GST ambit and with an increase in the VAT rate on MRP of country and foreign liquor to 25.93% from the existing 23.08%, the state will stand to gain.For the purpose of compensation to the state, under GST, the annual growth rate of 14% on the revenue for the financial year 2015-16 shall be considered. The compensation amount shall also include octroi in Mumbai (approx Rs 6,500 crore) and local body tax.The budget has exempted sugarcane purchase tax from 2015-2017 to sugar factories. This will generate Rs 700 crore which they could use to pay the cane price to farmers, it says. The budget also exempts the 13.5% VAT on card swipe machines to encourage cashless transactions.In line with the Centre's budget, the state budget has merged plan and non-plan expenditure. The change will bring more flexibility to each department to use their department allocation instead of only the plan component, which is only 25% of the total size of the budget, the state says."

Ganesh , 38, one of the farmers at Periya Muthaali village where the wall broke, said, ""The side wall of the canal of Kelavarapalli dam had broken many a times. This time, the range of loss is high as the floodwater submerged around 100 acres of fertile land,"" he said.Another farmer S Manjunath , 34, said farmers have faced huge loss due to negligence on the part of public works department (PWD).

He said now left side of the canal wall had broken.The Kelavarapalli dam was constructed across River Thenpennai near Hosur. About 8,000 acres, including 5,918 acres along the left canal and 2,082 acres along the right canal, benefit from the dam.

Goode,'' ``Sweet Little Sixteen'' and ``Roll Over Beethoven,'' died Saturday at his home west of St. Louis. He was 90.Emergency responders summoned to Berry's residence by his caretaker about 12:40 p.m. found him unresponsive, police in Missouri's St. Charles County said in a statement. Attempts to revive Berry failed, and he was pronounced dead shortly before 1:30 p.m., police said.Berry's core repertoire was some three dozen songs, his influence incalculable, from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to virtually any group from garage band to arena act that called itself rock `n roll.``Just let me hear some of that rock `n' roll music any old way you use it I am playing I'm talking about you. God bless Chuck Berry Chuck,'' Beatles drummer Ringo Starr tweeted, quoting some lyrics from a Berry hit.While Elvis Presley gave rock its libidinous, hip-shaking image, Berry was the auteur, setting the template for a new sound and way of life.``Chuck Berry was a rock and roll original. A gifted guitar player, an amazing live performer, and a skilled songwriter whose music and lyrics captured the essence of 1950s teenage life,'' The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame said in a statement.Well before the rise of Bob Dylan, Berry wedded social commentary to the beat and rush of popular music.``He was singing good lyrics, and intelligent lyrics, in the `50s when people were singing, ``Oh, baby, I love you so,''' John Lennon once observed.Berry, in his late 20s before his first major hit, crafted lyrics that spoke to the teenagers of the day and remained fresh decades later. ``Sweet Little Sixteen'' captured rock `n' roll fandom, an early and innocent ode to the young girls later known as ``groupies.'' ``School Day'' told of the sing-song trials of the classroom (''American history and practical math; you're studying hard, hoping to pass...'') and the liberation of rock `n' roll once the day's final bell rang.``Roll Over Beethoven'' was an anthem to rock's history-making power, while ``Rock and Roll Music'' was a guidebook for all bands that followed (''It's got a back beat, you can't lose it''). ``Back in the U.S.A.'' was a black man's straight-faced tribute to his country at a time there was no guarantee Berry would be served at the drive-ins and corner cafes he was celebrating.``Everything I wrote about wasn't about me, but about the people listening,'' he once said.``Johnny B. Goode,'' the tale of a guitar-playing country boy whose mother tells him he'll be a star, was Berry's signature song, the archetypal narrative for would-be rockers and among the most ecstatic recordings in the music's history. Berry can hardly contain himself as the words hurry out (""Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans/Way back up in the woods among the evergreens'') and the downpour of guitar, drums and keyboards amplifies every call of ``Go, Johnny Go!''The song was inspired in part by Johnnie Johnson, the boogie-woogie piano master who collaborated on many Berry hits, but the story could have easily been Berry's, Presley's or countless others'. Commercial calculation made the song universal: Berry had meant to call Johnny a ``colored boy,'' but changed ``colored'' to ``country,'' enabling not only radio play, but musicians of any color to imagine themselves as stars.``Chances are you have talent,'' Berry later wrote of the song. ``But will the name and the light come to you? No! You have to go!''Johnny B. Goode could have only been a guitarist. The guitar was rock `n' roll's signature instrument and Berry's clarion sound, a melting pot of country flash and rhythm `n blues drive, turned on at least a generation of musicians, among them the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, who once acknowledged he had ``lifted every lick'' from his hero; the Beatles' George Harrison; Bruce Springsteen; and the Who's Pete Townshend.When NASA launched the unmanned Voyager I in 1977, an album was stored on the craft that would explain music on Earth to extraterrestrials. The one rock song included was ``Johnny B. Goode.''Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born in St. Louis on Oct. 18, 1926. As a child he practiced a bent-leg stride that enabled him to slip under tables, a prelude to the duck walk of his adult years. His mother, like Johnny B. Goode's, told him he would make it, and make it big.A fan of blues, swing and boogie woogie, Berry studied the very mechanics of music and how it was transmitted. As a teenager, he loved to take radios apart and put them back together. Using a Nick Manoloff guitar chord book, he learned how to play the hits of the time. He was fascinated by chord progressions and rhythms, discovering that many songs borrowed heavily from the Gershwins' ``I Got Rhythm.''He began his musical career at age 15 when he went on stage at a high school review to do his own version of Jay McShann's ``Confessin' the Blues.'' Berry would never forget the ovation he received.``Long did the encouragement of that performance assist me in programming my songs and even their delivery while performing,'' he wrote in his autobiography. ``I added and deleted according to the audiences' response to different gestures, and chose songs to build an act that would constantly stimulate my audience.''Meanwhile, his troubles with the law began, in 1944, when a joy riding trip to Kansas City turned into a crime spree involving armed robberies and car theft. Berry served three years of a 10-year sentence at a reformatory.A year after his October 1947 release, Berry met and married Themetta Suggs, who stayed by his side despite some of his well-publicized indiscretions. Berry then started sitting in with local bands. By 1950, he had graduated to a six-string electric guitar and was making his own crude recordings on a reel to reel machine.On New Year's Eve 1952 at The Cosmopolitan club in East St. Louis, Illinois, Johnson called Berry to fill in for an ailing saxophonist in his Sir John Trio.``He gave me a break'' and his first commercial gig, for $4, Berry later recalled. ``I was excited. My best turned into a mess. I stole the group from Johnnie.''Influenced by bandleader Louis Jourdan, blues guitarist T-Bone Walker and jazz man Charlie Christian, but also hip to country music, novelty songs and the emerging teen audiences of the post-World War II era, Berry signed with Chicago's Chess Records in 1955. ``Maybellene'' reworked the country song ``Ida Red'' and rose into the top 10 of the national pop charts, a rare achievement for a black artist at that time. According to Berry, label owner Leonard Chess was taken by the novelty of a ``hillbilly song sung by a black man,'' an inversion of Presley's covers of blues songs.Several hits followed, including ``Roll Over Beethoven,'' ``School Day'' and ``Sweet Little Sixteen.'' Among his other songs: ``Too Much Monkey Business,'' ``Nadine,'' ``No Particular Place To Go,'' ``Almost Grown'' and the racy novelty number ``My Ding-A-Ling,'' which topped the charts in 1972.Berry also appeared in a dozen movies, doing his distinctive bent-legged ``duck-walk'' in several teen exploitation flicks of the `50s. Richards organized the well-received 1987 documentary ``Hail! Hail! Rock `n' Roll,'' a concert at St. Louis' Fox Theatre to celebrate Berry's 60th birthday. It featured Eric Clapton, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis, who recalled being told by his own mother that Berry, not he, was the true king of rock `n' roll.Country, pop and rock artists have recorded Berry songs, including the Beatles (''Roll Over Beethoven''), Emmylou Harris (''You Never Can Tell''), Buck Owens (''Johnny B. Goode'') and AC/DC (''School Days''). The Rolling Stones' first single was a cover of Berry's ``Come On'' and they went on to perform and record ``Around and Around,'' ``Let it Rock'' and others. Berry riffs pop up in countless songs, from the Stones' ravenous ``Brown Sugar'' to the Eagles' mellow country-rock ballad ``Peaceful Easy Feeling.''Some stars covered him too well. The Beach Boys borrowed the melody of ``Sweet Little Sixteen'' for their surf anthem ``Surfin' U.S.A.'' without initially crediting Berry. The Beatles' ``Come Together,'' written by John Lennon, was close enough to Berry's ``You Can't Catch Me'' to inspire a lawsuit by music publisher Morris Levy. In an out of court settlement, Lennon agreed to record ``You Can't Catch Me'' for his 1975 ``Rock n' Roll'' album.On his 90th birthday last year, Berry disclosed that he would release his first new album in 38 years in 2017, titled simply: ``Chuck.'' The announcement said it would be comprised primarily of new, original songs written, recorded and produced by him.In 2000, Johnson sued Berry over royalties and credit he believed he was due for the songs they composed together over more than 20 years of collaboration. The lawsuit was dismissed two years later, but Richards was among those who believed Johnson had been cheated, writing in his memoir ``Life'' that Johnson set up the arrangements for Berry and was so essential to the music that many of Berry's songs were recorded in keys more suited for the piano.Openly money-minded, Berry was an entrepreneur with a St. Louis nightclub and, in a small town west of there, property he dubbed Berry Park, which included a home, guitar-shaped swimming pool, restaurant, cottages and concert venue. He declined to have a regular band and instead used local musicians, willing to work cheap. Springsteen was among those who had an early gig backing Berry.Burned by an industry that demanded a share of his songwriting credits, Berry was deeply suspicious of even his admirers, as anybody could tell from watching him give Richards the business in ``Hail! Hail! Rock `n' Roll.'' For the movie's concerts, he confounded Richards by playing songs in different keys and tempos than they had been in rehearsal. Richards would recall turning to his fellow musicians and shrugging, ``Wing it, boys.''Berry's career nearly ended decades earlier, when he was indicted for violating the Mann Act, which barred transportation of a minor across state lines for ``immoral purposes.'' An all-white jury found him guilty in 1960, but the charges were vacated after the judge made racist comments. A trial in 1961 led to his serving 1 1/2 years of a three-year term. Berry continued to record after getting out, and his legacy was duly honored by the Beatles and the Stones, but his hit-making days were essentially over.``Down from stardom/then I fell/to this lowly prison cell,'' Berry wrote as his jail time began.Tax charges came in 1979, and another three-year prison sentence, all but 120 days of which was suspended. Some former female employees later sued him for allegedly videotaping them in the bathroom of his restaurant. The cases were settled in 1994, after Berry paid $1.3 million.``Every 15 years, in fact, it seems I make a big mistake,'' Berry acknowledged in his memoir.Still, echoing the lyrics of ``Back in the U.S.A.,'' he said: ``There's no other place I would rather live, including Africa, than America. I believe in the system.''"

The man sheepishly returned the pouch to his pocket.Another employee, a peon in the new Vidhan Bhavan building, said gutka and paan masala lovers were switching to chewing gum and toffees. ""The best part is people no longer throw the wrapper around, they put it into their pockets,"" he said.The state forest department has even put up posters in its corridors that say ""Aap camere ki nazar mein hain.

The animal got separated from the herd and fell into the open well. Forest rangers and anti-poaching watchers who were patrolling the area on Tuesday heard the cries of an animal in distress and found the animal in the well in an area covered with the invasive karuvelam trees Personnel of the forest department and the fire and rescue services began the rescue operation on Wednesday morning. ""Animals generally feel the difference in the ground level, but since the well was not fenced the animal might have slipped and fallen into it,"" said environmentalist Mohan Raj , who saw through the rescue operation.The lower 40ft of the well had concrete rings. On Wednesday night, forest officials cut a path up to the edge of the concrete area. ""We removed the sand to make way for a vehicle to reach this point. This took us almost the whole night and a few hours in the morning,"" said Periyanaickenpalayam ranger Palani Raja.Throughout the operation, the young elephant was fed water, jackfruit and sugarcane at regular intervals. It was also given medicines concealed in the jackfruit.On Thursday morning, the calf was given a mild sedative. ""By 11am it calmed down. We sent down four experienced mahouts into the well who tied belts with hooks around its legs, neck and body,"" said forest veterinarian Dr Ashokan. The animal, which weighed around two tonnes, was lifted out with a crane.The calf had sustained bruises on the head, trunk and hind legs in the fall. It was given a bath and medicine to help it come out of sedation. ""The calf immediately stood up and began running into the forest. We formed four teams and followed the animal who joined its mother and what appeared to be a sibling which had been waiting on the forest fringes since last night,"" Dr Ashokan said."

Construction of gutters, concrete roofing for semi-pucca structures and toilets are among the demands.Open spaces in localities have been developed into tiled and roofed structures where residents can spend leisurely evenings. Some MLAs are known to have constructed internal roads at their own cost, and even installed traffic signals.In Panaji constituency, whenever Atanasio 'Babush' Monserrate is on his door-to-door campaign, sources said, most of the families seek government job for one of their own. Babush, involved in a bitter fight with the ruling BJP after being out of power for five years, has been left with no choice but promise them one.The former town and country planning minister who has now formed his own party is known to be among the more generous politicians in Goa, picking up tabs of his constituents for medical emergencies, school fees and books. This time around as he attempts to win his third different constituency in as many state assembly election, he has upped the ante, promising Rs 1 lakh to every new born girl child in the constituency and financial assistance to women entrepreneurs.""In previous elections , voters were being lured with television sets, refrigerators, sewing machines and cycles but now there is a new trend,"" said a source closely involved with the electoral process.Most of the demands for household items come from the slum areas which in Goa remain well-equipped with televisions, refrigerators and other gadgets. One MLA promptly delivered the refrigerator to his constituent, only to realise that the door was too small for it to be carried inside! Candidates are also coming up with innovations to register themselves, or their symbols, in the mind of the voter.A former MLA has ordered for 10,000 coconuts to be distributed among his constituentslike they say, one in each family, while another one ordered for as many key chains, if not more, which are handed over during door-to-door campaigns.""Demonetisation has hurt a lot of politicians. The flow of money is not as strong as before but there is always a way to beat the system,"" a campaign manager told TOI.According to sources, several politicians passed on their ill-gotten wealth in Rs 500 notes to their constituents in December itself, asking all of them to ""remember the gift"" during election. Others have sought help from their friends who own bars and restaurants, asking them to provide unlimited stuff to whoever makes the demand.The practice of slipping higher denomination notes among the manifestos is common in Goa.""The ones who spend money on votes during election time are those who have not done anything in their constituency for five years,"" said Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai.In Goa, the limit on election expenses per candidate is Rs 20 lakh but major parties and career politicians are known to spend much more, not just during elections but at least a year prior as well when gifts are showered in the form of rice, ghee, sugar and even sareeswith a few currency notes thrown induring festive occasions like Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Christmas.Then there are coupons - bearing symbols of different itemsthat are handed over during door-to-door campaigns. These coupons can be redeemed once elections are over, and even if the candidate has lost, you can rest be assured that this is one election promise that always gets fulfilled.As someone has said: A politician never spends.

The retail price of sugar, which was at an average of Rs 28Rs 38 per kg at the end of last year, now costs between Rs 38 and Rs 45 per kg.There is expected to be a shortfall of 40% in sugar production by April when the new season begins, officials said. Figures from the state cane development suggest that production in Karnataka has hit below 40 lakh tonnes from an average of 50 lakh tonnes a year.Thirty-five sugar factories, largely in Belagavi and Bagalkot region, have stopped functioning owing to poor supplies,'' said Kurubur Shantha Kumar , president of the State Sugarcane Growers' Association.Shantha Kumar doubts whether farmers will get better prices owing to decrease in sugarcane yield. This is because the poor quality of produce this year might result in lesser prices since it is linked to the sugar recovery rate (percentage of production from a tonne of sugarcane).""Prices are going up because of high demand as traders are stocking for the festive season."" he added."

Shares of large U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are selling off after Trump says he is working on a system to reduce prices in the industry.

Higher tax, experts say, will help encourage healthier dietary choices.Pramod Jog, national president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP)said, ""Imposing higher taxes will attract public attention and eventually help sensitize consumers to stay away from such unhealthy food choices.""Gynaecologist and infertility expert Manish Banker, co-chairman and medical director of Nova IVI Fertility Clinic, added, ""Nearly 38%-66% women in India with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are overweight, which ultimately leads to metabolic complications.

While rawa fried is usually the go-to preparation for the catch of the day, the tangy and spicy recheado masala doesn't lag far behind.Recheado is a thick red paste, equal parts tart and pungent. It features heavily in a Goan household while pan-frying seafood. It pairs well with prawns and does just as well stuffed in mackerels. While shallow frying, the seasoned seafood is cooked halfway through before some of the reacheado is added, allowing it to wrap itself around the fish and make its way into every crevice. Some bits burn, but that adds to the overall flavor. You could also slit open the fish--- mackerel, perch, pomfret, there are few limitations--- and stuff it with the masala.The reacheado is usually mixed with minced onions, coriander leaves and chilli before it fills the fish. Vegetarians need not be disappointed, ladyfingers stuffed with the red masala make for a delectable side dish too.While variations of the masala are plenty, the base essentially remains the same-- Kashmiri chilies, garlic, spices ground in vinegar. Depending on the quantity of spices added, the flavor will vary. In addition to cumin and peppercorns, some use cinnamon and cloves. And depending on where in Goa you sample the masala, the amount of sugar increases. North Goa keeps it robust, but as you meander towards the south, the paste gets sweeter. A little bit of tamarind also finds its way into the blender. All of it is ground to a fine paste with vinegar, never water.As with all spice blends, there is always a distinct ingredient or two. In this case, it's Feni. Housewives have been known to add the local white spirit to increase the shelf life of the masala. Adding to the peculiar taste that comes with reacheado territory is coconut vinegar. While white vinegar is completely acceptable, there is a peculiar zing that only coconut vinegar brings.Once ground, the paste keeps for a very long time, months even. For storage purposes, glass and porcelain jars are preferred over plastic ones as it alters the taste of the masala due to the high acidic content."

Though Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 includes 'bhang' in the category of intoxicating drugs, it is being sold in the open market everywhere owing to the 'divine sanction and religious elements' associated with it.Sellers and consumers of bhang  the leaves of cannabis plant  claimed it grows in the wild and its consumption is considered auspicious on Holi and Mahashivaratri.""Bhang to jadi-buti hai. Shankar Bhagwan ko bhi chadhaya jata hai. Isme koi kharabi nahi hai; ulte puja-path mein use hota hai (Bhang is a herb and it is offered to Lord Shiva as well. There is no harm in its consumption. Besides, it is used in rituals as well),"" said a bhang seller on Ashok Rajpath.Officials in excise department, however, claimed that strict action would be taken against those found selling bhang. Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016 states that the leaves, small stalks and flowering or fruiting tops of the Indian hemp plant (Cannabis Sativa L), including all forms known as bhang, siddhi or ganja, come under the category of 'intoxicating drugs'. ""Sale and consumption of bhang is prohibited in Bihar. Strict vigil would be kept on its sale during Holi,"" assistant commissioner at excise department, Omprakash Mandal, told TOI on Tuesday.The excise department's directive notwithstanding, the sellers of 'bhang ka gola' and 'thandai' in the city are gearing up to meet the increased demand owing to prohibition in the state. ""We are anticipating an increased demand for 'thandai' this time and people have, in fact, started enquiring about its availability. Till last year, we used to sell at least 500 bottles of 'thandai' on Holi day,"" said the owner of a popular betel shop in Dak Bungalow area.'Thandai' or cannabis milkshake is made of nuts and spices like almonds, pistachios, poppy seeds, pepper, ginger and sugar or honey mixed with cannabis powder prepared from cannabis plant. Upon visits to a couple of shops in the city on Tuesday, it was found that 'thandai' would be sold at the rate of Rs 40-50 on Holi.Bhang sellers say it is being ""illegally"" sold at the rate of Rs 100/kg, whereas the rate of ganja is Rs13,000 to 15,000/kg. Bhang sold in Patna mostly comes from places in north Bihar, including Siwan, Motihari, Saran and Gopalganj, among others, where it grows mostly as wild vegetation.Health experts, however, have cautioned the revellers against overdose of bhang. ""THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive part of cannabis plant, attaches itself to the receptors in the human brain associated with thinking, memory, pleasure and coordination among other neurological functions. Overdose of cannabis affects the respiratory system leading to irregular heartbeat, hallucination and cardiac arrest. Consuming edible cannabis is, in fact, more dangerous as it metabolizes slowly and its effect is for a longer period. One should be rehydrated regularly, forced to vomit and taken to hospital in case of overdose,"" said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi.Going back in time: Some of the mythological stories associated with bhang revolve around the well-known tale about the churning of ocean or 'Samudra Manthan' by the Gods and the demons to obtain 'amrit' (elixir). One version states that marijuana plants grew wherever the drops of this elixir fell on earth, while the other version states that Goddess Parvati made some bhang to cure the pain of Lord Shiva after he drank poison churned out of the ocean. Charas, ganja and bhang are obtained from different varieties of the same plant called 'cannabis sativa' with bhang leading to minimum psychological effect and charas leading to highest effect. Overdose of any of the three varieties can lead to panic attacks or 'green out'."

Shares of large U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are selling off after Trump says he is working on a system to reduce prices in the industry. TRUMP'S TAXES Senate Democrats, seeking to capitalize on revelations about the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia, are urging a top Republican lawmaker to obtain the president's tax returns as a matter of national security. ADMINISTRATION The prosecutor tapped to fill the No. 2 position at the Justice Department declines to commit to appointing a special counsel to oversee an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The Senate Armed Services Committee votes overwhelmingly to approve Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster as Trump's second national security adviser, despite concern about his handling of a sexual assault case. WIRETAPPING White House spokesman Sean Spicer says he has no reason to think Trump does not support FBI Director James Comey after a dispute over the president's claim without evidence that he was wiretapped last year. IRAN The Trump administration pledges in a statement to show ""great strictness"" over restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities imposed by a deal with major powers but gives little indication of what that might mean for the agreement. NORTH KOREA The United States starts deploying the first elements of its advanced anti-missile defense system in South Korea after North Korea's test of four ballistic missiles, U.S. Pacific Command says, despite angry opposition from China.

They merely enjoy the special treatment conferred on them during the rituals.""The rituals are conducted by a group of people led by the village headman himself and the group is called 'Geriya' in local dialect. The men set out in search of eligible boys who have not undergone the `yagopaveet sanskar' (a Hindu tradition wherein Brahmins wear thin consecrated cord called Janaeu).""As per the ritual, the bri de and groom should compulsorily be minor boys who aren't married,"" says Kamlesh Sharma , a scholar who has done research in unique Holi traditions prevalent across Rajasthan. ""It is a thrilling experience as all the boys lock themselves inside their homes when they come to know that the Geriya is out on a search.

The duo is then brought to the village chowk at the Laxmi Narayan temple,"" Sharma says.A proper `lagan mandap' typical of traditional weddings is set up.

The country's sugar mills are in full swing at the height of the harvest.The Mexican Economy Ministry said it could not immediately comment. Officials from Mexico's sugar chamber declined to comment.Mexico's sugar quota, set annually by a 2014 trade deal, was established at 820,000 tonnes in the current 2016-17 crop year.The U.S. sugar industry late last year pressed the Commerce Department to withdraw from a 2014 trade agreement that sets prices and quota for U.S. imports of Mexican sugar, unless the deal can be renegotiated.The development comes as ties between the United States and Mexico have frayed under President Donald Trump, who took office in January and is seeking to renegotiate the North American Free Trade agreement as he sees the trade deal skewed to favor Mexico.'ABSURD' DISPUTEU.S. sugar prices have soared since late last year when Washington said the 2014 deal that suspended large duties on sugar from Mexico after a trade investigation may not be working as intended.The U.S. domestic raw sugar contract on ICE Futures U.S. settled at 31.71 cents per lb on Tuesday, the highest in nearly five years.The license cancellation by Mexico adds to protracted marketplace uncertainty, said Richard Pasco, president of the Sweetener Users Association trade group.""We need adequate supplies and the lack of resolution is a problem,"" he told Reuters in a phone interview on Tuesday.The document made no suggestion that the present dispute was related to the wider politics, but described as ""absurd"" an interpretation by ""low-level"" U.S. Commerce Department officials of a clause in so-called suspension agreements.The dispute centers on an interpretation of how the Mexican government issues export licenses to ensure supplies enter the United States at a regulated pace.It was not immediately clear how many sugar export permits were canceled or what penalties Mexico had faced.The Economy Ministry decided to cancel the permits since it has no counterparts at the U.S. Department of Commerce to resolve the issue, the document said. Mill owners should consider legally challenging the decision, it said.Staff positions remain unfilled in several U.S. government departments, a situation Mexican officials say has made it difficult to negotiate trade issues.

A proposal to this effect is likely to be put forth at a high level meeting scheduled to be convened by the cane development department on Monday.According to latest records of the cane development (updated till March 24), the 116 sugar mills operating in UP have an outstanding of Rs 4,177 crore to be paid to farmers in the ongoing crushing season. Of these, 91 private mills are liable to pay Rs 3,785 crore. Likewise, the 24 cooperative mills have yet to pay Rs 391 crore. The corporation mills in Meerut owe Rs 4 lakh to the farmers. Another Rs 219 crore had to be paid by the millers in 2015-16 and Rs 43.74 crore in 2014-15, records accessed by TOI showed.Payment of cane arrears within 120 days of government formation in coordination with banks had figured prominently in BJP's election manifesto, the 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra', during UP assembly elections. A senior government official in the department confirmed that modalities for getting bank loans provided to the mills would be worked out soon. ""State government would be sending the proposal to the Centre,"" he said.UP CM Yogi Adityanath has already entrusted UP chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar to monitor payment of cane dues to the farmers on a regular basis. Cane arrears had been a major poll plank of the BJP during the state assembly elections with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hitting out categorically at the previous SP government for failing to disburse compensation to the distressed farmers. Being one of the largest producers of sugar cane, UP's sugar politics had an impact on the election results, especially in the Jat-dominated western region which is where most of the sugar mills are located. Not surprisingly, soon after storming to power, the BJP appointed Suresh Rana, who represents west UP assembly constituency of Thana Bhawan in Muzaffarnagar district, as the cane development minister.The previous Akhilesh Yadav government had been slapping challans and at times getting FIRs registered against the millers defaulting on payments due to farmers. The action, however, did not yield much result even as arrears continued to mount. This was despite the state government providing a subsidy of around Rs 17 per quintal (including Rs 2 per quintal as purchase tax, Rs 2.75 per quintal as entry tax and Rs 6.30 per quintal as society commission) on the state advisory price (SAP) of Rs 280/quintal.Bajaj (15 mills): Rs 2295.59 croreSimbhaoli (3 mills): Rs 410.63 croreModi (2 mills): Rs 369.90 croreYadu (2 mills): Rs 58.97 croreMawana (3 mills): Rs 298 croreUttam (3 mills): Rs 137.5 croreWave (3 mills): Rs 21.9 croreRana (4 mills): Rs 71.34 croreBirla (4 mills): Rs 44.5 crore"

Democrats were unified against it.House Republicans had planned a vote on the measure after Trump late on Thursday cut off negotiations with Republicans who had balked at the plan and issued an ultimatum to vote on Friday, win or lose. But desperate lobbying by the White House and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was unable to round up the 216 votes needed for passage.""We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process,"" Trump told reporters at the White House, although he sought to shift the blame to the Democrats even though his party controls the White House, the House and the Senate.With Friday's legislative collapse, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - remains in place despite seven years of Republican promises to dismantle it.The healthcare failure called into question not only Trump's ability to get other key parts of his agenda, including tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending, through Congress, but the Republican Party's capacity to govern effectively.Neither Trump nor Ryan indicated any plans to try to tackle healthcare legislation again anytime soon. Trump said he would turn his attention to getting ""big tax cuts"" through Congress, another tricky proposition.Republican supporters said the legislation would achieve their goal of rolling back the government's ""nanny state"" role in healthcare. The White House made undoing Obamacare its top priority when Trump took office two months ago.But the White House and House leaders were unable to come up with a plan that satisfied the clashing interests of moderates and conservatives, despite Trump's vaunted image as a deal maker.Amid a chaotic scramble for votes, Ryan, who championed the bill, met with Trump at the White House. Ryan said he recommended that it be withdrawn from the House floor because he did not have the votes to pass it, and Trump agreed.""We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short,"" Trump said. ""With no Democrat support we couldn't quite get there.""Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the bill failed ""because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency since he took office: incompetence and broken promises.""Democrats said the bill would take away medical insurance from millions of Americans and leave the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system in disarray.And some moderate Republicans opposed the bill because of worries that millions of America would be hurt.""There were things in this bill that I didn't particularly like,"" Trump added, without specifying what those were, but expressed confidence in Ryan's leadership.""Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes,"" said Trump, who had posted multiple tweets throughout March proclaiming that ""Obamacare is imploding"" and repeatedly saying that Republicans were coming together to pass the bill.Friday's events cast doubt on whether Ryan can get major legislation approved by fractious Republican lawmakers.""I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard,"" Ryan said at a news conference, adding that his fellow Republicans are experiencing what he called ""growing pains"" transitioning from an opposition party to a governing party.""Obamacare's the law of the land,"" Ryan added. ""We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.""Members of the Freedom Caucus, the House's most conservative members, were instrumental in the bill's failure, opposing it among other reasons because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare.Trump said he was disappointed and ""a little surprised"" with the Freedom Caucus opposition.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said under the Republican legislation 14 million people would lose medical coverage by next year and more than 24 million would be uninsured in 2026.News that the bill had been pulled before a final vote was greeted initially with a small sigh of relief by U.S. equity investors, who earlier in the week had been fretful that an outright defeat would damage Trump's other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Benchmark U.S. stock market indexes ended the session mixed after rallying back from session lows following the news. The S&P 500 Index ended fractionally lower, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped about 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose about 0.2 percent.Shares of hospital operators finished sharply higher, with the S&P healthcare facilities index up 2.7 percent, while the S&P 500 healthcare sector edged down 0.03 percent. The dollar strengthened modestly on the news, and U.S. Treasury bond yields edged up from session lows.Trump said he would be ""totally open"" to working with Democrats on healthcare ""when they all become civilized."" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said working to lower prescription drug prices was one area of possible cooperation with Republicans.Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher said before the bill was pulled that voting it down would be ""neutering Trump"" while empowering his opponents.""You don't cut the balls off a bull and then expect that he can go out and get the job done,"" Rohrabacher told Reuters. ""This will emasculate Trump and we can't do that. ... If we bring this down now, Trump will have lost all of his leverage to pass whatever bill it is, whether it's the tax bill or whatever reforms that he wants.""Representative Joe Barton of Texas, when asked why his fellow Republicans were so united over the past seven years to dump Obamacare only to fall apart when they actually do something about it, said, ""Sometimes you're playing fantasy football and sometimes you're in the real game.""Obamacare boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law.The House plan would have rescinded a range of taxes created by Obamacare, ended a penalty on people who refuse to obtain health insurance, and ended Obamacare's income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax creditsIt also would have ended Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid state-federal insurance program for the poor, cut future federal Medicaid funding and let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients.House leaders agreed to a series of last-minute changes to try to win over disgruntled conservatives, including ending the Obamacare requirement that insurers cover certain ""essential benefits"" such as maternity care, mental health services and prescription drug coverage."

We are also aware of inter-State water sharing disputes which is the result of shortage of water. Farmers should use water judiciously. Excess usage would not only lead to shortage of water but also adversely affect soil fertility, he said. He cautioned farmers against reckless use of water. Claiming that the State government was emphasising more on water conservation, he said it has earmarked Rs. 1,500 crore for constructing of bunds and check dams. He appreciated the works of Siddu Nyamagouda, MLA for Jamkhandi, who is the inspiration behind the construction of the barrage with the contributions made by farmers without any government aid.The project is one of its kind the country where a huge barrage has been constructed by the farmers and for the farmers to address water scarcity, he said. Mr. Nyamagouda said that farmers, who were paying Rs. 60 lakh incurred on the annual maintenance of the barrage, have decided not to use water from Saturday evening till Monday morning every week to save water and electricity. He said that by not using water for about 36 hours each week, water could be saved for an additional 30 days. The MLA said that the barrage constructed at a cost of Rs. 90 lakh over 25 years ago, irrigates 35,000 acres of land in 27 villages.Hospital proposedSiddu Nyamagouda has proposed to construct a hi-tech hospital by using the contributions made by farmers.He said that his Jamkhandi Sugar Factory would contribute Rs. 1 crore and the remaining amount would be collected from farmers.

Let them take a call and come for discussions. We will take a call.""He said he was 'pained' with Thackeray's announcement that his party was parting ways with the BJP. He refused to answer questions on any possible NCP-BJP tie-up in the state.In the 2014 assembly polls, the BJP had won 122 seats. It fell short of 23 MLAs to reach the magic number of 145. Pawar then announced unilateral support to the BJP saying that the NCP's 41 MLAs will back the BJP on the floor of the House. This move had pushed Shiv Sena into a tight corner and Thackeray agreed to join the BJP government to keep the NCP away from the power.With new political developments, Pawar has once again played his old cards. The Shiv Sena has 14 ministers in the state cabinet and 63 MLAs in the House. With its own strength of 122 MLAs and support of 41 NCP MLAs, Fadnavis's government can get a clear majority in the House even if the Sena decides to quit.State BJP leaders, including guardian minister Girish Bapat, were at Pawar's residence in Pune to congratulate him after the central government announced the Padma Vibhushan, the country's second-highest civilian honour for Pawar for public affairs, besides six others.However, no BJP leader was ready to comment on a political fallout of the Shiv Sena's announcement to break the alliance. Senior party leaders said the Pawar-Modi bonhomie has already safeguarded Fadnavis's government in the state.Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who was at Vasantada Sugar Institute in Manjari recently on an invitation from Pawar, had praised the NCP president as an ""example"" for others in public life.""I have personal respect for Sharadrao. I was Gujarat's chief minister. He helped me walk by holding my finger. I feel proud to pronounce this publicly,"" he had said while congratulating Pawar on completion of 50 years in public life in 2017.

This was the point made clear by tree scientists, geneticists and experts here on Thursday on the sidelines of the first day of the two-day national conference on Tree improvement research in India: Current trends and future prospects hosted by the Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST).Bengaluru has an overdose of gulmohar and jacaranda trees. They are beautiful flowering trees, but its not a good idea to have them lining important avenues as these softwood varieties do not endure the harsh weather, said Surendra Kumar, director, IWST. Their fall-out rate is large, be it because of wind, rain or even road-widening  they fall apart, he said.It is not just the softness of the wood that makes the trees buckle under pressure, but their roots get damaged during road-widening, making them weaker. If the government authorities are informed of this, they can replace the trees with other varieties that are stronger, to make soil health more meaningful, Mr. Kumar said.There are plenty of trees to choose from. Pongamia ( Honge ) is a hardy alternative. These trees take only five years to reach a height of 10 metres. They can make up a canopy or be a stately addition to an avenue, said K.S. Sugara, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Karnataka Department of Forests.According to Mr. Sugara, Bengaluru could bring in varieties such as neem, bamboo, Burma bamboo, sandalwood and red sanders as avenue trees and also on vacant land, as these tree varieties help improve soil quality."

In such situations, heart transplant is the only available option to save their life. In Rajasthan, there is a need to generate awareness on organ donation. At present, the number of patients in need of organ donation is high but the procedure is not very prevalent,"" Bangalore's cardiac surgeon Dr Vivek Jawali said.Dr Jawali explained the cases in which bypass surgery or angioplasty should be done. In cases of major blockage where multiple stents are suggested, bypass surgery is a far better option. He also suggested that there should be quality parameters for stents for better and long-lasting results.Besides, Dr Vijay Kumar , a heart surgeon from Delhi, shared his views on high risk patients. He said the technique is TEBOR which performs like angioplasty and no incision is required. This is a better option for high risk patients having diabetes or asthma for valve replacement without any major surgery.Dr TS Kler, a New-Delhi based cardiologist, said, that hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery diseases are three major killers in India and all three are purely lifestyle diseases. He suggested simple preventive steps for these diseases like ideal body weight, exercise for 30-45 minutes daily, blood sugar and blood pressure check-up every six months, avoiding smoking and learning ways to de-stress yourself. ""You can opt for any activity like yoga, meditation, gossiping with friends, long drive, or any other option of personal choice. Research says that if you perform these on regular basis then you can treat heart disease and diabetes without any medical cure,"" Dr Kler said."

But, following the curbs imposed on sugar subsidy by the Union Budget, this is going to be a thing of the past, say ration dealers.There will be no sugar supply from ration outlets from April, T. Mohammedali, general secretary of the All-Kerala Retail Ration Dealers Association, told The Hindu . Because of the Centres sugar subsidy curbs, Kerala will no longer get subsidised sugar. He noted that Food Minister P. Thilothaman himself had expressed the concern that the State would not be able to supply sugar to ration beneficiaries from April.This is a big blow to the State as the Left Democratic Front government had recently decided to supply sugar to all the families on the ration priority list. The scheme has now been undermined by the Budget proposal.The immediate impact of the scrapping of ration sugar will be a hike in the price of sugar in the open market. Mr. Mohammedali pointed out that already the price had gone up by Rs. 5 a kg.For close to half a century, sugar has been part of the ration kitty in Kerala, the State which until recently had been a shining example of a public distribution system that covered the majority of the population. Initially, each family used to get 2.5 kg of subsidised sugar a month, which had later been cut to 2 kg. However, from 1997, when the controversial Targeted Public Distribution System was launched, the number of families entitled to the sugar quota fell to 20 lakh from 69 lakh. Mr. Mohammedali said though sugar supply was a big loss to the ration retailers, they considered it as a service. He noted that for a quintal of sugar costing Rs. 1,380, the ration retailers got a commission of only Rs. 15, while the cost of transporting and distribution was around Rs. 150. He sees the end to the sugar era as yet another symptom of the disintegration of the glorious PDS in Kerala."

Veera Shanmuga Moni inaugurated the camp. Unlike in the previous years, the inauguration was low-key this time, with no Minister or any other elected representative present.A pet project of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa since 2003, the camp was held for the first four years at Mudumalai and for the last four years at Thekkampatti. As on Thursday, 31 elephants turned up and three more are expected to join in a day or two. Seven elephants that were not brought owing to health reasons or refusal to board the trucks will go through the same rejuvenation routines at their respective temples.In addition to Theppakadu, camp elephants of the Forests Department will undergo rejuvenation at Chadivayal in Coimbatore and at Top Slip near Pollachi. Of the 31 temples, five are from the mutts such as Thiruvaduthurai, two from Jeer Mutt at Thirukkadayur and Thiruvaiyaru.The usual guest jumbos from Puducherry are Lakshmi from Manakula Vinayakar temple and Prakruthi from Thirunallur Dharbanyeswarar Temple.As in the previous camps, friendly elephants struck a bond on day one of this one too. HR & CE has allocated Rs. 1.16 crore for the camp whose duration this year has been reduced to 30 days, from 48 days. Though no reason was officially cited, sources attributed it to drought conditions and that the delayed start to the camp would only push it into peak summer if they had persisted with 48 days.As is the standard operating procedure, the elephants were weighed and the readings were compared with the health charts of the previous year. Based on progress or deterioration in health, a diet chart was prepared by a team of veterinarians. The schedule includes a morning walk of one km to three km depending on the gender, age and weight and then a bath in the showers erected along the Bhavani river, followed by special pujas.The HR & CE and Forests Departments have put in place a three-tier security to prevent wild elephants from entering the camps. Watch towers to monitor movement of wild elephants, solar-powered barbed wire fences and power lines and iron sheets to cordon off camp site are in place. The diet includes 11 types of greens, five varieties of grams, rice, ragi, sugarcane and 7 types of medicines."
58f5d3ac7be9e01a357a8045,An author's story,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/an-authoraposs-story/articleshow/56544856.cms,2017-01-15,"In 1925, when he was 18 years old, RK Narayan failed his University entrance examination in English. An enforced gap year followed, and every morning of that year, Narayan would walk from his house at 1087, Bojjanna Lines, to the banks of the Kukkarahalli lake, with a book of poetry in his pocket. ""After a walk around the tank, I sat down under a lone tree on a rise of the ground, opened the book, and partially read and partially observed the water birds diving in,"" he wrote later.This was at a time when the population of the city was a little more than a lakh, and people walked to get from place to place, and not for fitness.On Narayan's mornings around the lake, his companions were cowherds and their charges. There would have been little noise apart from bird song and the sound of the leaves, rustling in the breeze.Today, there's a parking lot near the lake, and it's full. The path around the lake's perimeter is full of people, walking briskly - or slowly, in their track pants and Nikes. And while the island in the middle of the lake is still full of birds, it's hard to imagine a dreamy-eyed teenager with a dog-eared copy of Palgrave's Golden Treasury lazing around on a bench, watching them today.Bojjanna Lines is still around, as well. You won't find it on Google Maps, but it's a small street that runs opposite the Chamarajapura Railway Station. It's a quiet street, still mostly residential. There are some old houses, but none look as if they've been around for close to a century now. And finding what was 1087, back in 1925, is pretty much a lost cause.From Bojjanna Lines, Narayan's father moved to Lakshmipuram. It was while his family was here that Narayan went through college, and got his first job as an English teacher at a government school in Channapatna. The job was a disaster, and he returned to Mysuru . It was in the Lakshmipuram house that Swami and his friends took shape, mostly on an ancient, 'elephantine' typewriter. During this time, Narayan would walk from his house to Chamundi Hills, with a notebook and pen, and write under the shade of the tree.Walking around Mysuru became an integral part of the author's day. ""Leaving early in the morning, I sauntered down Vani Vilas Road, at old Agrahar slowed my steps in order to pray briefly to Ganesha installed under a peepal tree on the roadside; the scent of jasmine sold on the foot-path, and of sandalwood from manufacturers of incense sticks in the neighbourhood, wafted in the air... At every turn I found a character fit to go into a story. One could not traverse the main artery of Mysore, Sayyaji Rao Road, without stopping every few steps to talk to a friend. Mysore is not only reminiscent of an old Greek city in its physical features, but the habits of its citizens are also very Hellenic. Vital issues, including philosophical and political analyses, were examined and settled by people (at least in those days) on the promenades of Mysore.""The Ganesha under the peepal tree has his own temple now, a neat structure with multiple deities and officiating priests. The streets remain as crowded - if not more so, but you are unlikely to find citizens indulging in political analyses and philosophical discussions anymore. There's no longer the scent of jasmine and sandalwood in the air, but there are pushcart vendors selling chaats and fruits, as well as plastic bags stuffed virulently yellow popcorn. And some of Narayan's old haunts remain - despite facelifts and transplantation.There were some regular stops that Narayan made on his perambulations through the city. One was Srinivasa Stores, at KR Circle, where not just he, but all his family shopped. The old Srinivasa Stores, with its heaps of cloves and betelnuts and raisins and cashews and spices is long gone, of course. In its place is another Srinivasa Stores, a ""glamour store"", selling perfumes and cosmetics. Dwarkanath, the son of the founder of the original shop, sits in another Srinivasa Stores, on Kothwal Ramaiah road, this one selling jumbo thermometers and Accu Chek sugar monitors and Tynor medical compression stockings.Dwarkanath is in his eighties, but he looks decades younger. In other times, he would be called ""dapper"". His head is neatly combed, and while his hair looks suspiciously black, there's not a strand out of place. ""Narayan was a great friend of my father, NA Subramania Setty, who established the shop back in 1931. The entire family were our friends. He used to come there around eleven o'clock. He used to sit next to my father, behind the cash counter. He would even handle the cash, count out change for our customers while chatting with us,"" he says. ""He would observe people keenly, their conversations, their mannerisms for hours together,"" he says. ""It was almost a home for him. Sometimes he would discuss the short articles he wrote for the papers with my father.""Dwarkanath pauses, remembering. ""He had a thing for betelnuts. I was married to a Shivamogga family. On the day of my marriage, I remember him saying 'Dwarkanath, from tomorrow, I want only the best betelnuts from Shivamogga'. He used to be very fond of a certain variety, P10s, and we made sure that he always got it. Even when he went abroad, we would ship packets of 50 gms and send it to that area. I think there was no customs duty on packages below 50 grams, so we used to send multiple packages.,"" he says.""Of course, everybody knows about Narayan's fondness for betelnuts, but he used to smoke as well. Gold Flake cigarettes, the plain ones, unfiltered. Filtered cigarettes came much later. He wasn't a heavy smoker, but whenever he bought a packet, I knew that he was going to write something,"" says Dwarkanath.At J Nanumal & Sons is a small bookstore on Sayaji Rao Road, another occasional stopping point for the author. ""He used to stop by here, once in a while, and look through our books,"" says NB Ashok Kumar, the proprietor. ""We make sure that we have all his books on sale, all the time,"" he says, as he points to a shelf full of Narayan's works, wrapped in plastic.Another, more frequent stop, was the stationery store R Krishnaswami & Sons. It's been run by the same family for three generations now, and still does brisk business at its Benki Nawab Street location. K Subramanyan, the son of the founder, was one of Narayan's close friends. ""We were friends of the family for a long time. We lived in the road next to theirs, opposite the railway station. Of course, they moved to Lakshmipuram afterwards, but our association goes back a long way,"" says Subramanyan. ""He never liked publicity. He would visit the shop regularly, in his veshti, coat and his inevitable umbrella, sit and chat a while before leaving,"" he says. ""He'd sit there, watching the groundnut seller, the cucumber vendor, and then, there would be a story about them, in the paper.""""He used to be very fond of music, and would attend kutcheris. He was a close friend of Veena Doreswamy (Iyenger), and he even learned the veena,"" he says.""We went to his house for Pattabhi's (Narayan's elder brother) daughter's wedding, and all the great Carnatic singers - DK Pattamal, ML Vasanthakumari, and MS Subbulakshmi - were there,"" says Sarada, Subramanyan's wife.""I remember he used to drive a Morris Minor. Then, he got himself a Mercedes Benz. I think it was a gift from a German distributor who saw the movie adaptation of the Guide. He would later complain about it being a white elephant. 'What do I do with it? I have to hire a driver for it. I have to construct a shed to keep it in. It gives only 8 miles to a gallon of petrol,' I remember him complaining,"" says Subramanyan.Subramaniam stayed in touch with the writer till the very end. ""I used to visit him whenever I went to Madras,"" he says. ""And the first thing he would ask me was for news of Mysore,"" he says.Narayan always saw himself as a Mysurean, but his relationship with the city has always had some kind of uneasy tension, something that went back a long way. There's a famous anecdote about how Somerset Maugham (and in other tellings, George Bernard Shaw or HG Wells or PG Wodehouse), while visiting Mysuru as a guest of State, wanted to meet any authors in the city, and was told by Sir Charles Todhunter, the Maharaja's secretary, that there weren't any. The late TS Satyan, Narayan's close friend and famous photographer, remembered the attitude of schools and libraries in the city being offered signed copies of Swami and friends. ""Not many of them showed any interest and some of them thought that by accepting the books they were doing ... Narayan ... a great favour,"" he said in a speech organized by the Central Sahitya Academy on the occasion of Narayan's birth centenary.More recently, of course, was the controversy surrounding converting Narayan's Yadavagiri house into a memorial, where several Kannada intellectuals, including the poet GS Shivarudrappa and the novelist SL Bhyrappa, protested the move, saying that the government should not spend money on the effort, because Narayan was not a Kannadiga, and because he did very little to promote Kannada literature to the outside world.The memorial is in place today, and while the writer's house has been given a makeover - a fresh coat of paint has been applied, and the red oxide floors are polished to gleaming - it still remains underwhelming. There are a few shelves of books, a display cabinet showcasing the awards and honours Narayan received for his works, and a few randomly selected quotes of dubious quality and stills from Malgudi Days displayed on the walls.Krishna Prasad, the journalist and the person behind the popular blog Churumuri, is one of the key people who lobbied for the Narayan memorial. ""It would have been good to have his papers, his old typewriters, as exhibits,"" he says. ""But Narayan himself is to blame for the scarcity of material. Why are the US presidential libraries so good? Because everything is saved, stored. You can bet that things are already getting preserved for the Donald Trump museum,"" he says.The most striking feature of the memorial is a wall where hang a set of framed photos. And one of the most striking is a photo of Narayan and his wife Rajam, taken in 1938. Rajam would die a year later, an event that devastated the authorOutside the memorial stands a frangipani tree, ancient, gnarled and twisted. And the branches still bear those delicate white and yellow flowers. It seems an appropriate gatekeeper."

Senior government officials from the social welfare department also accompanied us in our visit, during which we asked the affected girls to share their experiences without any fear. The girls echoed similar experiences of sexual abuse that were mentioned in the letter.""Assistant commissioner with the social welfare department (Beed) Ravindra Shinde said the school management has suspended the accused teacher.""The inquiry at our level is still in progress and we will serve a show-cause notice to the school management once it is over.

Farmers say they have been unable to withdraw the money as rural banks do not have sufficient cash even two months after demonetisation was announced.Angry at not being able to withdraw their money, a large number of farmer leaders are squarely blaming BJP for the crisis.Farmers had hoped to earn better returns on their crops last year bouyed by an upward swing in the market for sugar. In fact, for the same reason, most of the sugar mills paid cane dues on time.According to the data provided by cane department, there are nine sugar mills in the district. Most of the mills have been paying cane dues on time. Officials confirmed that a sum of Rs 800 crore had been transferred into the bank accounts of the farmers.Talking with TOI over this issue, state secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union Rajendra Singh said, ""The central govt has rattled the farmers by enforcing demonetisation. In this season, farmers had to face an economic crisis due cash crunch. Owing to this, they could not sow the wheat crop on time.""Singh added, ""Two months have passed but the situation remains the same. Most of the rural banks are providing only Rs 1,000 or Rs 2000 cash a day. To withdraw this small amount, some banks are making farmers wait for a day.Many farmers also complained that they had to stand in long queues for cash rather than tend to their crops. Taking a dig at BJP-led central govt, the BKU leader said, ""The central govt has done nothing for farmers. We never opposed demonetisation. We also want that black money should be unearthed but govt should have made proper arrangements to deal with cash crunch problems. If the situation is not improved, farmers will go against BJP in the assembly polls. We will teach a lesson to BJP.""When TOI contacted district cane officer OP Singh, he said, ""Around Rs 800 crore have been deposited in the farmers' bank accounts. I have written a letter to the lead bank to pay special attention to rural banks. Banks are also trying to resolve the problem of farmers.""Talking with TOI, Bijnor BJP MP Bhartendra Singh said, ""To unearth the black money and stop the corruption, central govt had demonetized the old big currency and the results are fantastic. The public of India supports the move of demonetisation wholeheartedly despite faving some economic hardships. The people want to root out the corruption from India. As a result BJP performed well in the recently held 'sthaniya nikaye chunav' in Chandigarh and Mumbai. People are with BJP and our party will get a majority in the upcoming polls at UP."""

On the campaign trail in western Uttar Pradesh, however, it is his zestful recounting of his visit to Pakistan for the SAARC summit last August and the surgical strikes by the Army across the Line of Control last September that gets him the most applause.As Mr. Singh criss-crosses the region, from Agra to Aligarh and Dadri, he recounts how he did not want to visit Pakistan for the SAARC meet, but when I heard that anti-India groups who supported use of terror against us said they would not allow me or Prime Minister Modi to set foot in Pakistan, that is when I said that I would go and deliver a tough message against terror, and I did.When terrorists crept across the LoC and attacked our jawans as they slept, martyring 17 of them, our government gave a fitting reply, he says referring to the surgical strikes. India does not provoke anyone, but if provoked it doesnt leave any challenge unanswered, he says.In contrast, demonetisation and the campaign against black money does not draw quite as much applause, though when he links it to ending terror financing, there is a show of hands from the crowds in appreciation.The BJPs promise in its manifesto to write off agricultural loans and an undertaking to reduce interest rates to zero is again a crowd-pleaser. In Aligarh, Mr. Singh just makes a passing reference to illegal slaughterhouses and the need to close them down. A local BJP worker says on the sidelines that it is an issue for the party in the area. Cow slaughter is rampant here. Gai bhai son main dubka kar maar dee jaati hain [cows are slaughtered hidden among buffaloes], says Vineet Varshney Bunty, a local BJP man in the district.Mr. Singhs son Pankaj Singh is in the fray in Noida. As the rallies move closer to that seat but skirt it, he says he would not be campaigning for his son. He has been working there since he was 22. The voters know him and me too, he says.At Bulandshahr, the BJPs worries on the splitting Jat vote (the community voted en masse for the BJP in 2014) are apparent. Pictures of former Prime Minister Charan Singh dot the rally ground despite his party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, fighting against the BJP. In Agra, a mention of local MP Ram Shankar Katheria draws jeers. These are the issues that the party needs to be wary of, the angry Jat vote, bogged down with worries over the dues to sugar-cane farmers and unpopular MPs.Mr. Singh, however, is determined to plough on, marking the enthusiastic response of the crowd to his oratorical style. In U.P. this time, its all versus us [the BJP], he says. He dismisses the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance. One leader whose party needs propping up [referring to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi] and the other party has a Chief Minister [Akhilesh Yadav] who blames his uncles for his failure, Mr. Singh said."

PHOTO: S.S. KUMARS_S_KUMARThe High Court order restraining the District Registrar from registering unauthorised layouts will go a long way in preventing rampant conversion of agriculture land for real estate business.In the last several years, a large chunk of agriculture land in rural areas of the union territory has gone into the hands of realtors leaving a huge question mark on the long-term livelihood means of farmers.Statistics reveal that in the late 1950s, paddy had been cultivated on around 52,000 hectares of land in the union territory. The area had shrunk to 25,200 hectares in 2016. Similarly, sugar cane had been cultivated on an area of 10,000 hectares during the early 1960s as against the present 3,000 hectares.Leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) V. Perumal, who had been fighting for long against conversion of agriculture land for real estate purpose, said the High Court decision would prevent large-scale conversion of agriculture land.We used to export excess paddy to neighbouring States. Bahour was once known as the rice bowl of UT and now the paddy fields have been converted into plots. The farmers have not benefited from the sale, he said.The High Court, acting on a petition filed by advocate Elephant G. Rajendran, on Tuesday directed the District Registrar not to register unauthorised layouts.Sources in the Revenue Department said more than 90% of the plots registered did not have the approval of the Department of Town and Country Planning.The court order, notwithstanding the social side, would create a dent in revenue collection. The order comes at a time when the Revenue Department was staring a revenue shortfall after the government reduced guideline register (GLR) value of property by 25%. The revenue from registration of property had been on the decline because of fall in registration of property. The revenue collection came down to Rs. 124 crore in 2014-15 and further to Rs. 117 crore in 2015-16.The cut in GLR value coupled with demonetisation has caused a huge revenue loss. It could be difficult to cross the Rs. 50-crore mark, he said.Review petitionOfficial sources told The Hindu that the government might file a review petition to exempt the union territory from the order."

I asked him.He thought for a moment. Cats catch mice, he replied. Then he added: But they cant help it. (He knew this because we have a pet cat, though she has never met a mouse.) These drawings arent of cats. They just have the faces of cats. Theyre people. Are these people with cat faces being mean to the mice?I nodded. He had got it. Is this a real story? he asked.One of the hardest conversations with children  much harder than talking about birds and bees  is about injustice. We teach children to be fair and to expect fairness in return. This is the essence of parenting. Dont use your hands when youre angry; use words. Dont use mean words; use words to say what you mean. Be kind. Be fair.But how does one teach children to respond when the world isnt fair? How do we teach them to handle discrimination, to stand up for others, to make the world a better place? To go high, as Michelle Obama said, when others go low?The power of booksOne of the critical ways to teach children about tolerance and justice is through reading. Reading takes children outside the bubbles in which we try to protect them, and into the lives of others far removed from them. Reading teaches empathy. It gives universal power to individual stories. It talks about things that we arent sure how to talk about and says things that we often dont know how to say. It speaks to the imagination and to the heart.Last week, I ordered a set of American civil rights hero John Lewiss three-volume graphic memoir March . John Lewis is one of the iconic figures of the American civil rights movement. As a student, he applied to Troy State University even though he knew blacks werent allowed there. It was one of his first acts of protest against segregation. The boy from Troy, as Martin Luther King Jr. described Lewis, chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and was one of the leaders in the student-led sit-in movement and the Freedom Rides in the early 1960s. At the legendary 1963 March on Washington, John Lewis was one of the youngest speakers. In 1965, he helped lead the historic Selma to Montgomery March as part of the voting rights movement.This National Book Award-winning collaboration between John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and artist Nate Powell presents an affecting first-hand account of the struggle for civil rights. At the National Book Award function, Lewis recalled how in 1956, as a little boy, he wasnt allowed a library card at his local rural library because of his race. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, said Santayana. March is an attempt to remind young readers about one of the most important civil rights struggles of the 20th century. It is a struggle that still continues. The memoir uses the 2009 inauguration of former U.S. President Barack Obama as a frame for its civil rights narrative. Because of you, John, wrote Obama on a card that he gave to Lewis on that historic day. Because of you, thereby tracing a line back from that cold January morning in 2009 to the story of the American struggle for civil rights and voting rights.There is another line in the narrative, another Because of you that goes further back from the struggles in Alabama and Mississippi in the 1960s to India and the freedom struggle led by Gandhi. Remember the teachings of Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, writes Lewis in his list of dos and donts for the sit-in protests. Love and non-violence is the way.The cover of the first volume shows a group of protesters sitting at a lunch counter. Their faces are tense, nervous, but determined. On the counter before them are ketchup, mustard, salt, pepper, sugar, tissues and a sign that says Counter Closed. This is what the protesters are up against.The story begins on the morning of what would later be called Bloody Sunday. It begins on the Edmund Pettus bridge across the Alabama river. A line of marchers is on the bridge, and the state troopers are at the other end. Can you swim? Hosea Williams asks John Lewis, at the head of the march. No, says Lewis. Well, neither can I, replies Hosea. But we might have to.Moments in the memoirHistorical events are often brought to life in graphic novels in ways that are beyond the scope of textbooks. There are many unforgettable moments in this powerful work: the rich detail as the visuals zoom in to look at the anxiety in a persons eyes or zoom out to look at the vast fields over which the volunteers trudge day after day. The way the words and music of the movements songs curve around the panels, linking past to present, first softly and then soaring in epic, poetic fashion: They say that freedom is a constant struggle/ They say that freedom is a constant struggle/ Oh Lord, weve struggled so long, we must be free/ We must be freeOne of the most moving moments in the memoir is the search for the three missing volunteers in Mississippi. A line of dark trees, a few stars in the night-time sky, a small triangle of torchlight on the grass. A voice: You see anything? And then, on the next page, pitch black, a forlorn silhouette in grey, and the tiniest, saddest, most exhausted of responses: No.March is about how social heroes are made, through courage and non-violence, and about what Lewis describes as good trouble: to find a way to get in the way. It is also about the power of books themselves as manuals in the quest for social justice. One of the early sources of Lewiss own inspiration was a 1957 comic book titled Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story , a 16-page, 10-cent narrative about non-violent resistance for desegregation.Sometimes going to school was a luxury my family couldnt afford, Lewis reflects about his childhood. He hid from his parents and ran to catch the school bus in the mornings instead of working on the farm. The school library was a place of discovery. After the first time he heard a speech by Martin Luther King, he says: I went to the school library on Monday to find out everything I could about this man.This week, as we read the part about the first march from Selma, on Bloody Sunday, my nine-year-old peered closely at the picture of John Lewis lying on the ground, a puddle of grey stones around his forehead. Thats blood! said my son, shocked. Hes bleeding. Thats blood dripping from his head.He was silent for a moment.Is this a real story? he asked me quietly.Yes, I replied.Uma Mahadevan Dasgupta is in the IAS and is currently based in Bengaluru.At the National Book Award function, Lewis recalled how in 1956, as a little boy, he wasnt allowed a library card because of his race."

(Clockwise from top): Karuppu, a prized bull in the jallikattu circuit, takes on two young men; a memorial for a temple bull; M. Muniyandi, an agricultural labourer, with his Pulikulam.Photos: Shaju JohnThe setting sun and fading natural light probably hurried P. Karthikeyan; while trying to get Karuppu to pose for photographs, he found himself too close to the bull with no one to hold the nose rope. For once, Karuppu did not grunt a warning. His left foreleg bent, aiming horns at Karthikeyans belly. As he thrust himself at his owner, Karuppus horns came up in a clockwise arc. Karthikeyan ignored all his what-to-dos about avoiding being gored: he did not hit the dirt back-first and roll away. All he managed was a yelp, a quicker response than Karuppus that left the unsuccessful bull yanking at the taut rope tied to a stump, and a nervous laugh. Three years of no jallikattu and it seems I have forgotten how to control him, he says.It is a startling admission of memory erosion made by a man whose family has always had bulls, less than 15 km from the bull-taming sports most famous venue. Ever since the Supreme Court-imposed ban on jallikattu in 2014, Karthikeyan  a resident of Pudhupatti, which lies in between Alanganallur and his farm in Chellana Goundanpatti  has hired someone to take over the supervision of his four bulls, all indigenous breeds.Even as he doubted his abilities ahead of a delayed jallikattu season, Karthikeyan will not hear of questions about the bulls memory: He will remember once I apply the pottu (vermillion mark) and sandalwood paste on his forehead on the morning of the jallikattu. He refuses to eat after that.As jallikattu returns to Alanganallur shortly, the story of the bull  that commands respect, even devotion, from the fear it evokes  is also the story of humans who spend years loving it.Dry runs before D-DayKaruppu, a pulikulam breed, snorts when anyone except his handler approaches. He lets his body jerk violently with each snort, his tail hangs away from the body and he goes broadside. Raja hangs even further back from his 15-odd friends. He got me once about a month back, he says, raising his shirt to show a scar on his left lower abdomen. I was drunk. He was tied anyway and I thought I could hug him, he smiles sheepishly.It is daybreak on January 24, a day after police lathi charge and stone-pelting in Alanganallur. Fearing arrest, these boys from Pudhupatti had stayed overnight at Karthikeyans fields. Since the police were after them, no one gave surnames. Once morning tea was done, they decided to warm up for jallikattu.The boys fan into a semi-circle, eyeing the seemai karuvelam sapling to which Karuppu was tied. Ravi approaches the bull. Karuppu begins a brisk walk and breaks into a run. The boy, aged 18, retreats and Karuppu finds himself yanking at the rope. He then goes anticlockwise towards the others, sending them scampering. At this point, Karuppu stops, considers the boys and runs away as far as the rope would let him, to the other side. Karthikeyan sports a frown immediately. Karuppu has never been one to let go the opportunity to flip a human. In jallikattu parlance, he is a suttru maadu  instead of galloping to the finishing (collection) point like the pokku maadu , he dares his suitors to come at him.The more the boys try to approach, the more Karuppu tries to flee. At the end of one such dash, the seemai karuvelam sapling comes off, roots and all. Karuppu does not turn around. He stops about a hundred metres away and begins horning the ground, covering himself with dirt. Bulls that can do this make it difficult for us to escape by rolling on the ground. Some owners train them with a straw dummy. Some bulls get so good, they can target even a lemon kept on the ground, says a breathless boy. I think it is because of the nose rope. It is probably chafing at a wound he sustained recently, says Karthikeyan, now concerned. He asks the boys to back off and secures the animal, constantly conversing with it through grunts. Later, he feeds him a guava from the hand; one way to get reacquainted.From an embrace to chaseWe are very strict with rules these days. The bulls as well as the tamers have to undergo testing on the day before as well as the morning of the event, says Dr. Meril Raj, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at the Government Veterinary Dispensary, Alanganallur. Among other things, both are checked for alcohol consumption, injuries and age; bulls should be between three and seven years old, tamers should at least be 18 years. I was once rejected at Alanganallur for being only 47 kg. They said I had to be at least 50 kg, says Sekar, a resident of the same village.There are some things that do not get rejected, though. Sometimes, owners spread ground glass on the bulls body and we wipe it off. We also make sure that sharpened horns are blunted, says a government official who has been part of four jallikattu preparations at Alanganallur for four years. Decorations  even vermillion and sandalwood paste  on the bull are not allowed anymore; tamers are required to wear organising committee-supplied uniforms.Bull owners and tamers are unequivocal in declaring that they do not harm the animals. The government official is sympathetic: You should see the care they show these animals. They are always wiping their face with a towel ahead of releasing them, as if the bulls are being readied for a ramp walk. According to him, pre-event injuries to the bull take place within the vaadivaasal (arena). Owners are given only 90 seconds to release the bull. Sometimes, when the bull sees so many people at once, it panics and refuses to leave. The owner gets desperate  his pride is at stake  and he prods it violently to get it to run.It may not merely be pride alone anymore. From a piece of cloth tied to the bull, prizes have grown to include consumer durables, gold coins, and now, cash. When they believe their bull is invincible, owners announce cash prizes of up to Rs. 10,000 on their own for those who tame their animal.The sport has changed along with the world it inhabits. From eru thazhvuthal , meaning embracing the bull, it became manju virattu , which means chasing an agitated bull. Jallikattu derives its name from the prize: a bundle of coins that would be tied to the bulls horns.Return of the indigenousLegislating jallikattu freezes it in time and risks subsuming the village-level variations of the game. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 allows for manju virattu, vadamadu and eruthu vidum vizha . There used to be 200 jallikattu events during the best years for the sport. It came down to less than 25 before the [2014] ban. Right now, we dont mind the new rules as long as jallikattu returns, says Siva of Alanganallur. Why do you think we did not protest when ram-fighting, cock-fighting and rekla races were banned in the State? he adds, pausing for effect. This. Breeding. Jallikattu is the only way to save our indigenous breeds.With the government aggressively promoting the Jersey breed in these parts, farmers see breeding and jallikattu as the only reasons to have an uncastrated bull in a village. It has not helped farmers that the jallikattu ban coincided with five poor years for agriculture, with the current season being the worst in 20 years. Seemai karuvelams are invading lands left unploughed.I am unable to cultivate six of my 11 acres this year due to drought. I have managed only 12 bundles of harvested paddy from 1.5 acres; I should have got 40 from just one acre, says Karthikeyan. He has cut back on the area in which he has planted sugar cane and has instead pinned his hope on guava trees, which are ripe for harvesting for the first time.Karuppu stays and grazes in the open field, except for when it rains. Twice each day, he is given rice husk powder in water. A month ahead of jallikattu, Karthikeyan starts feeding him cotton seed in water in the evenings  some owners add chopped coconut. A flour of rice, ragi, green lentils, husk and sorghum, mixed in water, is sometimes given ahead of the cotton seed feed. Karuppus swimming  to help with his leap  also increases in frequency as jallikattu approaches; the ongoing drought means there is no water enough for a swim now.As far as farmers are concerned, the trouble with indigenous breeds is that they produce much less milk than Jersey cows. So, if the former gives you six litres a day, the latter manages 15 litres, says Dr. Raj. Thanks to higher fat content, milk from the indigenous breeds is paid Rs. 10 more per litre by procuring agencies and stands at Rs. 32. Farmers say the dung from indigenous breeds makes for good fertilizer. One animal can give me enough dung to take care of two acres. The Jerseys dung is unusable, says Karthikeyan.During the years in which jallikattu was not held, many farmers sold their bulls and villages donated theirs to goshalas (cow shelters). Ahead of jallikattu, bulls are making a return. I was in Tiruchi today to buy a bull for a friend. They wanted one lakh rupees for a five-year-old bull that would have otherwise cost Rs. 30,000. We didnt buy, says Karthikeyan. He attributes it to a demand-supply mismatch.A sacred bond, a spectacleSome soldiered on during the ban years. Karthikeyans uncle M. Muniyandi is an agricultural labourer now, having sold all his land to marry off two of his three daughters. Yet, Muniyandi has a Pulikulam, tied to the side of the road in front of his house. The bull, eight months old when bought, is six years old now. The 65-year-old owner emerges from his house with the trophy the bull won at Palamedu  he walked away with a milk cooker that day. At a jallikattu in Dindigul once, Muniyandis bull won a tiffin box and a packet of 10 jallikattu T-shirts.There is resolve in his answer when Muniyandi is asked how difficult it is to maintain a jallikattu bull: He is my son. He is brother to my three daughters. I talk to him like I would talk to a young boy and he responds.Jallikattu arenas are no places for bull whisperers, though. It is not even taming the bull. You hold on to the hump. Not too tight, because the bull then controls you. Not too loose, because youre then thrown off, says R. Kannan of Palamedu, who participates in jallikattu regularly. Winners are required to hold on to the bull for less than 20 metres.Like good guard dogs, bulls like Karuppu live in isolation. So does the bull tamer, a good fortnight ahead of jallikattu. Groups of boys go to the village temple and tie a yellow cloth, with a piece of turmeric wrapped within, on their right wrists. From then on, its like putting on the maala (garland) for [the] Sabarimala [pilgrimage], says P. Balasubramanian of Managiri village who used to participate in jallikattu.Like Karthikeyan, who too was a tamer, Balasubramanian stopped putting himself in harms way after getting married. In some cases, the whole point of participation is marriage itself. Pointing to a woman in Palamedu, Kannan says, When her husband was courting her, she said she would marry him only if he won at jallikattu.It turns out in the minds of the bull tamers, jallikattu is a team game. I always warm up and participate with my team members. There is a designated tamer for each bull. The idea is for the others to distract it enough so that one person can hold it, says Karthi, who lives in Alanganallur. Teams are also useful for their sheer numbers. Sometimes, a humiliated owner will try to pick a fight. Then, there are boys who go ahead and break the unwritten rule about not taming a bull from ones own village, just to spite the owner, with whom he may have a long-standing grievance, says Balasubramanian.Denied a bicycle last time jallikattu was held there because the bull he caught had ran out later than the allotted 90 seconds, Karthi was headed for an unapproved jallikattu, held at an undisclosed location, on January 24. A while ago, most of his friends had run away after hearing false rumours of police raids within Pudhupatti. We have not got enough practice because of the protests and uncertainty. But you need not worry. The bulls will be there, and so will we. Come watch us.deepu.sebastian@thehindu.co.inIt is not even taming the bull. You hold on to the hump. Not too tight, because the bull then controls you. Not too loose, because youre then thrown off - R. Kannan of Palamedu"

Addressing a rally in Bisalpur constituency of Pilibhit district, the firebrand leader also said that if BJP forms government in UP, it will permanently shut down all slaughter houses in the state.""If their work was sufficient to show development work in UP, why did they tie-up with dead snakes like Congress? Why is SP contesting on less than 300 seats?"" the BJP MP said. ""Let BJP form government in UP, goons of SP, engaged in illegal possession of land, will be thrown behind bars.""Stressing on the deteriorating law and order situation in UP, Adityanath said, ""In the year 2013-14, as many as 3,000 rape incidents had been reported in UP, which increased to 9,000 in 2014-15."" A data released by UP State Crime Records Bureau in 2016 show that rape cases have gone up from 3,467 in 2014 to 9,075 in 2015.Eariler, at a rally in Bulandshahr, the leader had urged voters to ""remember the rapes and the riots"" when they go out to vote on February 11, the first phase of elections in the state. ""There are more than 25 towns in UP where exodus (of Hindus) has taken place. Once we are in power we will deal with this menace strictly,"" he had said.Explaining the district's proximity to Nepal, Adityanath said, ""Cow smuggling is rampant from the neighbouring country and SP is unable to curb the illegal activity. If BJP is elected to power, it will ban all slaughterhouses in the state and will never let it reopen."" Closure of illegal slaughterhouses is also a part of BJP's manifesto in UP. The leader further said that since the district is adjacent to Nepal, it also faces threat of Maoist activities.While talking about farmers' rights, Adityanath said, ""The BJP government will protect the interests of sugarcane growers and ensure that they are paid within 14 days from the day canes are supplied to sugar mills."" He said that the saffron party will concentrate on the growth of agricultural sector in UP and will waive off all crop loans of marginal farmers, regardless of the amount."

The hike will come into effect from Saturday.Consumers will now have to pay an extra 800 crore. A close scrutiny of the ERC tariff order bares another shocker: An additional 887 crore ""pending true-up"" burden will also have to be borne by the consumers. Power sector experts see a higher burden as the tariff is calculated in telescopic structure now. All those who have an average monthly consumption of over 200 units (category C) will have to shell out more.For example, those who consume more than 225 units a month will have to pay a much higher tariff now. ""The burden is estimated at around 800 crore. We have effected no hike on low-consuming categories thereby giving relief to a large number of consumers. We have not accepted the proposal to levy fixed charges on domestic consumers,"" said Justice G Bhavani Prasad , chairman of APERC. Around 15.47 lakh agriculture farmers will continue to get free power for seven hours a day. The government, on the other hand, agreed to pay 3,700 crore towards subsidy to power discoms, which is 400 more than the previous year. With a whopping deficit of 8,065 crore, the discoms will still struggle as the estimated revenue through the latest tariff hike will only be to the tune of 800 crore.Aqua culture, animal husbandry, poultry hatcheries, poultry feed mixing plants, sugarcane crushing, mushroom, rabbit farms, floriculture in green houses and religious places will have to pay 3 to 3.6 per cent higher for power consumption."

He attacked the SP rule for encouraging mafias and goondaraj, and blamed the State government for lack of growth in the world-famous lock industry of Aligarh.After his acronym SCAM for the SP, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati on Saturday, Mr. Modi coined another at his rally on Sunday  VIKAS which, he said, stood for vidyut (electricity), kanoon (law and order) and sadak (roads).Lock industry ruinedAddressing a huge rally on the Numaish ground in Aligarh, Mr. Modi said, Here in front of me I can see a saffron sea. When a storm comes, everyone looks for a safe shelter. Similarly, in the storm of peoples support for BJP, the Chief Minister here has joined hands with anyone he found. But, the fact is, that wont save him from the storm.Mr. Modi accused the SP government of ruining the lock industry of Aligarh and said, The present government of the State has nothing to do with development. The Aligarh locks used to be world-famous, but the State government has made sure that the manufacturing units were shut down and the Aligarh locks were used to lock them. The lock industry is no longer in a great situation.The manufacturing units were shut down because the State government in Lucknow could not provide them with electricity. People at tea stalls and hotels talk how electricity came on specific days of a week. But the times have changed. We are working all day and night to ensure that electricity reaches every home. We are working for U.P.s VIKAS, Mr. Modi said.Accusing the entire Opposition of ganging up against him because of the Central governments moves against corruption, the Prime Minister said, These days some people are issuing fatwa against me because I have started tightening the screws. Through demonetisation, I asked for an account of the crimes they have committed for the last 70 years. These people have nothing to do with development. They came together only to ensure that Modi doesnt get a majority in the Rajya Sabha and he is unable to make laws to curb and expose their corruption.Recruitment scamHe raised the issue of allegations of corruption and discrimination in favour of youth belonging to the Yadav community in recruitment by the Akhilesh Yadav government and promised elimination of all kinds of corruption from the recruitment for government jobs in the State.Widows pensionExpressing shock at the reports of corrupt people withdrawing money out of a widows pension from banks, Mr. Modi said, the corrupt are flourishing under the present U.P. government. To stop this, we have, from the Centre, linked pensions to Aadhaar cards and bank accounts. Forty thousand crore of the treasury that these rats would have silently eaten, is now being saved.Mr. Modi told the gathering, many of whom were farmers: The Akhilesh government buys only three per cent of grains from farmers. But we gave Rs. 22,000 crore to sugarcane farmers. Give us an opportunity, we will change the situation completely.Touting shocking crime figures to underline his point of the goondaraj in the State being patronised by the SP government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, There are 24 rapes in Uttar Pradesh daily."

The order was issued after the MNC was found selling the beverage that contains artificial sweeteners, suspected to cause health problems, without the mandatory warnings.The FDA action came after a Kolhapur official found that the product was being sold loose to ""unsuspecting clients"", including children and pregnant women.The key problem is the presence of two artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium--suspected to cause obesity, insulin resistance and high BP, among other health impact. Since years of research have failed to establish the components as completely harmless, any product containing them are supposed to carry warnings.The Coke Zero that was being sold at the McDonald's outlets did not specify that the drink was not recommended for children or for phenylketonurics.""For the latter, particularly, such a violation can be critical,"" said FDA commissioner Dr Harshdeep Kamble. ""Phenylketonuria is a rare genetic disorder and those who suffer from it cannot break down phenylalanine, a component of aspartame (one of the sweeteners). Their excess intake can lead to an unusual buildup in the body. Children can suffer from serious neurological deficiencies as a result of consuming the drink unknowingly,"" said Kamble, adding that people should be told about the dangers lurking inside the so-called healthy drinks.Calling the contravention a ""serious one"", Kamble said non-adherence of the order can lead to penalties for the company. ""They can sell the Coke Zero cans like most other fast food outlets but not through dispensers,"" he said. He clarified the order won't apply to other beverages as they don't contain artificial sugar and have necessary permissions.The drug regulatory body found out during investigations that Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt Ltd, which owns and runs McDonald's, was procuring a pre-mix from Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages. However, McDonald's was creating the final product by treating the mix with carbonated water. These sweeteners are also present in Diet Coke, said an FDA official.A spokesperson from McDonald's (west & south) told TOI that the company adheres to all statutory requirements. ""We are compliant with all applicable laws pertaining to usage of loose cups and glasses. For the time being, we have decided to follow the FDA directive."" The Hindustan Coca Cola, in their response to FDA, had said that they had all the requisite permissions to manufacture synthetic syrups containing artificial sweeteners for dispensers. The company, however, could not be reached for comments.Kamble added that both the companies have some sort of an exclusive arrangement as far as the product was concerned as no other food outlet was found selling the drink though a dispenser. He said that Section 34 of the Food Safety and Standards Act empowers the commissioner to issue such a prohibition order. However, the diktat will not be applicable outside Maharashtra.The FDA, in its order, has quoted a study by the Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, which stated that a daily consumption of diet soda increased the risk of non-hodgkins lymphoma and multiple myeloma in men by 42%. Another study quoted in the report spoke of a link between artificial sweeteners and metabolic abnormalities.The USFDA says that no health problems have been consistently linked to aspartame use. ""Research on artificial sweeteners, including aspartame, continues today. For people who want to avoid aspartame, the easiest way to do this is to check the labels before buying or eating foods or drinks."""

Now, they will be charged a total of Rs 50,000 as licence and processing fee. It has also been proposed to charge an additional fee of Rs 1 lakh on manufactures of high bouquet spirits, who import concentrated alcoholic beverages to sell to other manufactures within and outside the state.The liquor industry has always been heavily taxed, and even during March 2016, a similar pinch was felt when the excise duty on Indian-made foreign liquor and beer manufactured in Goa or imported was raised, and import fee on bottled wine brought into the state hiked from Rs 6 to Rs 10 per litre.A government official said that comparatively the liquor industry felt a milder pinch this time. ""The industry will be affected if the SC order becomes applicable in toto, which may be why the finance minister has not touched the industry much,"" he said, and added that GST may have also influenced the decision to downplay taxation on the industry, since its impact is not yet known."
