All vegetables at Re 1 a kg. These are the rates at which Gautam Budh Nagar farmers are selling their harvest to middlemen and retailers at the sabzi mandi (weekly farmer's market) in Jewar. The middlemen truck the produce to faraway mandis, while the small vendors cart their daily buy to local markets. Like the rest of India, here in Jewar, , despite a good harvest, there are no takers for the produce.Distraught farmers blame the market meltdown on demonetisation . There's a glut, but procurement prices have crashed over the last two months. With cash flow still disrupted, farmers are selling at throw-away rates.Local vendors on carts and at roadside stalls are selling vegetables at Rs 5-8 per kg. ""What we are picking up from farmers is selling very slowly. People are not buying much. Most farmers are selling produce at Rs 1-2 per kg,"" said Baleshwar, a middleman. Jewar farmers are selling produce in Palwal in Haryana or Bulandshahr, with few bringing their produce to the wholesale market at the SEZ II, Noida, he added.Vendor Md Salim said he has bought 50kg of potatoes at Rs 250 from a middleman. He has tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and seasonal fruits on his cart. Over a week, he expected to sell the potatoes at Rs 7/kg and carrots at Rs 10/kg, giving him an average profit of Rs 2/kg of vegetables sold, and an overall profit of Rs 300-500.Some farmers claimed the crash will continue affecting them for several months, as winter is when they make a clean profit, which helps them tide over the year's uncertainties.""We're ruined. Some farmers are so frustrated, they're dumping truckloads of cabbages or tomatoes by the roadside, or selling at rock-bottom prices. Urad and arhar dal growers haven't even recovered their investment,"" said Mahender Singh, vice-president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) and a resident of Jewar.""In 2015, we sold urad dal at Rs 10,000 per quintal. This year, we sold at Rs 4,800. From Rs 9,000 per quintal last year, arhar dal is down to Rs 3,500. Sugarcane growers haven't received payments for four months. A quintal of rice is going for Rs 2,100. Yesterday, a tractor of tomatoes went for Rs 20. This morning, cabbage went for Rs 10 for 10 kg,"" Singh added.TOI caught Singh and other farmers discussing current affairs in Charauli, a five-minute-drive from Neemka, the model village adopted by BJP MP and Union minister Mahesh Sharma. Charauli is one of the many villages which falls under Jewar's shelved airport project.At Mahesh's house in Charauli, where the farmers had gathered, tons of unpolished rice can be seen rotting. Jewar doesn't have a rice mill. ""We've not been able to sell the kharif crop for four months,"" said Rakesh Nambardar, former district BJP president.In desperation, farmers are pinning their hopes on the upcoming assembly polls. ""Either we get a good price for the produce, or facilities for food processing and cold storage. Even our money is locked in banks. How are we going to survive?"" said BKU's Singh."

As Jharkhand's administrative machinery observed World TB Day on Friday at a city hotel, Rai said the nutrition cell should be formed under the monitoring of the state health, health education and family welfare department.""Many TB patients are poor and cannot afford a nutritious diet. My department can only supply wheat, rice and sugar, and that only to the ration card holders,"" Rai said. ""There must be a cell that looks after their nutrition,"" Rai said.Rai's comment came after the annual TB status report of Jharkhand, compiled and unveiled by the state wing of the revised national tuberculosis program (RNTCP), showed a rise in the number of fresh TB cases in 2016. The RNTCP report said more than 36,000 new TB cases were recorded at government and private hospitals last year  roughly 3,000 more than 2015.The report, which pointed out the lack of nutritious diet among TB patients, also stated that the state's TB burden at this time is a little over 4.6 lakh with rising numbers of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases. While 16,000 MDR-TB-suspected patients have been screened, more than 1000 MDR-TB cases have been recorded.Dr. Pravin Chandra, director-in-chief of the state health services, on Friday stressed on the need to deploy more cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) machines in every hospitals (block, sub-divisional, district and medical colleges) for quick diagnosis of MDR-TB machines. ""The machines have been provided with help from the Union health ministry. This will reduce the time taken to properly diagnose a MDR-TB patient and put him in the correct line of treatment,"" Chandra said."

An investment of around Rs 1,000 crore has been made on them.A state cabinet meeting chaired by CM Nitish Kumar at Rajgir decided that the licences of 21 distilleries operating in the state would not be renewed from 2017-18 financial year. These units may be allowed to operate if they start manufacturing non-alcoholic beverages from the facility.The licence of only six ethanol-based manufacturing plants would be renewed. Produced from sugarcane molasses, ethanol is used mostly for being mixed in petrol. It is supplied to leading oil companies.The decision follows the opposition criticism of the Nitish government's ""double standards on prohibition"" as it was allowing manufacture of liquor in the state for its transportation to rest of the country. The Nitish government had in September last year waived taxes on liquor manufacturing units and decided to extend such benefits to even new plants provided they sold the beverages outside the state.The state cabinet approved altogether 32 proposals. It decided to open high schools in those panchayats which have become open defecation free. It also sanctioned Rs 196 crore for execution of the skill development component of the CM's 'Saat Nischay' initiative."

He also directed the officials to prepare a list of agriculture projects in demand in Oman, so that they could be exported. He directed them to find out key areas in which skill-development courses could be started so as to generate employment opportunities for youth of Haryana in Oman.Salim said there was a lot of demand for maize, corn and sugar in Oman for human consumption, and also to cater to the needs of the poultry sector. ""Haryana can meet that demand by exporting these commodities. There is a huge requirement for skilled manpower in Oman in the areas of mining, shipping, petro-chemicals, marketing and office staff. Haryana can prepare a trained workforce by providing them skill training as per the industry needs in Oman.

KRS dam is reaching the dead storage mark during summer which is not even sufficient for supplying water for drinking purposes. The monsoon has also become unpredictable. There is severe drought situation in more than 15 districts in the state.The release of water from dams to agricultural lands through canals is also failing, as 30 % of the water evaporates while around 30 % percolates into the ground. Only 30 % will reach the agriculture land. This is not benefiting farmers. Farmers have to adopt technologies to yield more crops using less water,"" he said.Centre not developedShivanna said that the research center in Naganahalli, which is celebrating its centenary, has not developed as expected. ""It is in a 45 acre land and we need at least 150 acres for taking up various research activities. Even though the center is promoting organic farming through training and workshops for farmers, the lack of water facilities and inadequate land at the center is hindering its progress,"" he said.Shivanna said that the university will submit a proposal to CM Siddaramaiah for the development of the center.Talking about food production, Shivanna said that by 2030 the population of the country will reach 160 crore which is expected to overtake China.

Evidences of creation of bogus assets and siphoning off money from the company through various concerns engaged in turnkey projects for setting up of sugar factories have also been gathered, a release said.Huge cash depositsExamination of various entry providers, immediate bank enquiries and surveys carried out at cooperative societies confirmed that huge unexplained cash deposits have been made in the bank accounts of family members and associates.

Photo Rajeev Bhatt: In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Lisaad presented an imagery of saffron  communal feelings were running high and the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) flags dotted the village on polling day. The BJP went on to sweep the region, as it did the State.This time around, the dominant colour in this Jat-dominated village in Shamli was the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) flag  the hand pump on green and white. As the riot-affected village voted on Saturday  around 13 people were allegedly murdered here in September 2013  the change in political sentiments was remarkable. The Jats here are seen rejecting the BJP even though it fielded a candidate from their community  Tejinder Nirwal.The BJP is treating the Jats as if we are cabs meant for hire ( kiraye ki taxi). Without the Jats, the BJP is nothing in this belt, said Devinder Malik, a Jat farmer, resting on a cot near a sugarcane field.Multiple reasonsThe Jats anger against the BJP stems from many reasons  some economic, other emotional. If they blame the Modi government for failing to pay the dues of sugarcane farmers, in the same breath they also rake up the neglect and disrespect meted out by the BJP to former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh and his family, and the Jat reservation issue in Haryana.Chaudhary ji (Ajit Singh, RLD leader and son of Charan Singh) was thrown out of his kothi (official bungalow in Delhi). And now, when polling is near and the BJP sensed the Jat vote is slipping, Modi remembers Charan Singh ji in his Bijnore rally. Did he even mention him once before that... on his birthday, December 23? asks Shailendra Malik, one among the many Jat men gathered outside their homes after exercising their franchise.The village is in the heart of the sugar belt and there is anger among Jats for the BJPs failure to pay their dues. Demonetisation is also criticised here, but in patches.Mill owners got the interest rate waived while farmers are still waiting to get their dues. They got no relief. Some got nothing more than Rs. 20 or Rs. 30 from the cooperatives, said Dalbir Singh, former MLA from the seat and uncle of Brijendra Malik, who is in the running as the RLD candidate. Nobody has done good to us like the RLD  it created awareness among Jats, got awareness, chips in Arvind Chauhan.The Muslims of the village fled after the riots and now live in Kandhla, a kasba . If most of them sold their original homes, many Muslim homes remain untended, their doors locked. The communal divide has dissipated since 2013 but it looks unlikely that the alliance that Chaudhary Charan Singh nurtured would be restored any time soon as Muslims are not expected to return here. The Jats also deny that any lives were lost in the violence, claiming that the Muslims hyped up figures to get compensation from the government. They blame the BJP and the Samajwadi Party (SP) government for the riots. Many Jat youth were falsely arrested, is the common refrain.The Jats, however, remember the riots as unfortunate  as it has not only defamed the community but also broken the economic ties with Muslims, who provided them with a cheap labour force.Even today, around 150 Muslims come here daily to sell wood, or as labour. Before the riots happened, there was a deep bond between us. The polarisation destroyed that, said Arvind Chauhan, who works in a sugarcane factory.An audio recording of BJP president Amit Shah requesting Jats for their support has allegedly gone viral. When Jats in neighbouring Kiwana village are asked about it, they dismiss it as another gimmick.  Kuch farak nahi padega (nothing with change). The BJP is a party of liars, retorted a Jat elder.Travelling across the Jat belt in western U.P., the shift in mood is apparent. On this seat, the Jat votes are expected to be split among the RLD, the Congress and the BJP  all three have fielded Jats. The Congress Pankaj Malik is the incumbent."

Moreover, this court finds nothing wrong in adding the parents of the deceased as dependents.""Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that children of the deceased employee had to be treated as dependents, the compensation sum will have to be apportioned from the share payable to the children's mother and not from the amount payable to the parents of the deceased employee, Justice Vaidyanathan said.The case relates to the death of Subramaniyan who, while working as machine operator at Sakthi Sugar Mills in Sivagangai , suffered a grave injury and subsequently died on the injuries suffered in the course of employment. Invoking Section 22 of the Workmen Compensation Act, an award of 5.75 had been passed by the designated Tribunal. Based on a report of the inquiry officer appointed by the deputy commissioner of labour to ascertain the real dependents of the deceased employee, children of the deceased had been excluded from the array of dependents and the father and mother of the deceased were included as dependents.It is against their inclusion that his wife Thilagavathi filed the present petition in court. During arguments, it came to light Thilagavathi did not live with the deceased for at least two years before the industrial accident, and that it was his father who spent money for medical expenses.Citing this, Justice Vaidyanathan said the authorities' decision was perfectly valid in the eye of law."

This year, a 10-kg lump cost Rs. 370 during the festival season. After that, much against market wisdom that the price might dip to Rs. 350 or Rs. 340, it had risen and touched an unprecedented Rs. 370 for lowest quality. For the best variety it went up to Rs. 400.Usually we get around 15,000 to 17,000 lumps a day on an average around this time of the season. But having never seen such a price, farmers are bringing in more and more quantities and at present it is 27,000 to 29,000 lumps, says president of the Anakapalle Merchants Association K.V. Sarat Kumar.For one pakam (traditional measure for nine lumps of 15 kg each), farmers used to get a take home profit of Rs. 1,500 but now it has more than doubled, he analysed, adding farmers had never seen such a high price.Crop failure inMaharashtraThe buying spree is attributed to the interest shown by traders from Krishna district. The reported sugarcane crop failure of almost 60 % in Maharashtra could be a contributing factor.However, as against the usual market condition of 50% each going to direct sale and storage, only 20 % is going to sale and 80 per cent to cold storage, he says. Stocks account for about 6750 tonnes so far at the Anakapalle market with an annual turnover of about Rs. 130 crore. Another reason for low direct sale is that the Uttar Pradesh market is quoting at about Rs. 60 less than that of the Anakapalle price. The gap generally used to be Rs. 20/Rs. 30, Mr. Sarat Kumar points out."

After finishing their trips in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the families entered Chittoor a couple of days ago.Head of the group, 76-year-old Harishi, who hails from Bhopal, selected the Kanikalamma temple zone near the sugar factory. Temporary sheds were erected in no time. Work commenced on a war-footing, right from procuring iron material from gujrees (shops selling waste material), melting them, and casting iron sheets.Quick at knowing customer pulseThey would wind up the roadside business in a fortnight and proceed to some other destination.Members of the group are very quick in grasping the requirements of their customers, mostly meat shop workers and farmers. The implements would be made on the spot.Information about their arrival spreads like wildfire, hardly missing the ears of prospective customers in a radius of 20-25 km.Quality aspectLocal patrons say that they can purchase a very fine machete for Rs. 120 and an axe for Rs. 100.If we miss these people, we will have to shell down double the price for the implements that dont match the quality of those made by the Lohars, they say.Mr. Harishi said that he had come to Chittoor as a young man nearly five decades ago.Chittoor is the gateway to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as we travel by South-bound trains. We remember our nomadic haunts and places of luck. We call it genetic memory. We keep going without rest. To lead our life with happiness, we have to compete with quality levels and, at the same time, win the confidence of patrons, he said. Their roadside business would run round the clock in shifts. Women, young girls, and children too join the job, hitting and shaping iron lumps and sheets. What all they earn would go for their food and travel expenses.Till five years ago, we used to make ticketless travel in general compartments of various trains. Now, we are afraid. We cant risk our entire amount to be taken away during checks, said Renuka Lohar, a young woman of the group.They admit that they never thought of educating their children.Senior men of the group said that nearly a hundred families of blacksmiths from MP and parts of Uttar Pradesh keep roaming the entire country, split into a number of groups.Thanks to mobile phones, all our families remain connected, said Balaji Lohar."

Hyacinth contains up to 50% hemicelluloses, which are natural polymers present along with the cellulose of plant cell walls. The research is based on the idea that in order to produce commercially viable, low-carbon-footprint biofuel, one has to supplement cellulosic ethanol with hemi cellulosic alcohols. While cellulose is used for cellulosic fuel production, hemicelluloses are often ignored as biofuel sources, primarily because surface reactions are capable of releasing only a quarter of the soluble sugars for bioethanol production.The IIT-Kharagpur study explains that the secret to rapidly producing soluble sugars required for bioethanol production from hemicelluloses lies in their pores. The average cellulose to hemicellulose ratio in plant cell walls is slightly below 2:1, suggesting that supplementing cellulosic fuels with hemi cellulosic ones would enhance biofuel productivity and cost-effectiveness by more than 50%. This is perhaps the highest yield that any research has promised so far. Simultaneous production of cellulosic and hemi cellulosic fuels from the same biomass source would considerably improve the combined Net Energy Value (energy content of ethanol minus energy output) for cellulosic ethanol (about 21.5 MJ/lit), the article in 'Nature' explains.""Increasing the polymer's porosity and swelling will eventually lead to increase in bioethanol,"" said Saikat Chakraborty, faculty of the chemical engineering, department and lead researcher of the Bioenergy Research group of the institute."

The authorities identified 10 acres of land on which they planned to raise cashewnut, sugarcane, gingelly and some vegetables.Cashewnut is proposed to be raised on about four acres and gingelly on two acres once the land is ready in a week. Watering of the crops is proposed to be done using borewells by connecting the land with pipes. There are nine open wells and a borewell. Plans were afoot to sink a few more borewells.The other lands would be used for planting saplings of species such as vembu and palmyra by approaching the Forest Department in a couple of months. Saplings of fruit bearing trees such as guava and sappotta would also be raised.The Prison Department has about 289 acres of land of which the Central Prison complex is on 50 acres.

Mahadeva Prasad, they say the Nanjangud byelection could have been avoided. The Nanjangud bypoll became necessary after Srinivas Prasad from the Congress resigned on being dropped from the Cabinet, and who is now contesting on BJP ticket.Both the constituencies are in the grip of an unprecedented drought. Distress migration has become a way of life in parts of Nanjangud rural and Gundlupet.Farmers in hundreds have abandoned agriculture and are heading towards cities, said Kurubur Shanthakumar, president, Sugarcane Cultivators Association. None of these issues has been taken up by either of the parties even though the entire Cabinet has pitched its camp in Nanjangud-Gundlupet areas.Most telling is the finger-pointing and the blame game played out by the two parties over waiver of farm loans.The focus is on winning the bypolls which will have no impact on the government as the Assembly elections are slated to be held around this time next year, said Mr. Shanthakumar.Attahalli Devaraj, another farmer activist, concurs with this view. Farmers are receiving notices from financial institutions for non-payment of loans despite the fact that their crops have failed due to drought, he said. A majority of farmers from Nanjangud-Gundlupet areas felt the same way at a meeting held last week to discuss the severity of the drought.MigrationIn areas around Gundlupet, many farmers who have quit agriculture owing to drought have sought work in the rubber plantations near Kerala and tea plantations in Ooty.Local observers say Congress and BJP activists are trying to trace the workers to ensure their presence in their villages on voting day.It is needless to say who will bear the cost of transportation, besides showering them with perks."

The Devendra Fadnavis regime is in a dilemma as precious hours of the budget session are lost in mayhem.However, NCP chief Sharad Pawar stole a march over the Sena by calling on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi earlier in the day to urge him to offer loan amnesty to Maharashtra farmers without further delay. In his 20minute talks with the Modi, Pawar demanded that the Centre should resuscitate the cash-starved sugar industry in the state, it is learnt.Uddhav's loan waiver demand is a strategy to keep the BJP on a tight leash and to project the Sena as the ""guar dian angel"" of the agriculture community , said party watchers. The Sena held demonstrations in Jalna, in Marathwada , to demand loan amnesty to farmers following crop failure and unseasonal rain.That the Sena legislators should join hands with the opposition to halt the business of the two houses of the state legislature--that too during the crucial budget session--has left the BJP fuming. The state budget is scheduled for Satur day . ""Although an ally in the Fadnavis regime, the Sena joins the opposition members to stall the house proceedings. The Sena ministers should realize that they are bound by oath of office,"" said a senior BJP legislator.While the Fadnavis government is amenable to the loan waiver, Fadnavis does not want to act in haste. ""The CM will make sure that relief reaches straight into the affected farmers' accounts and that the official-neta-contractor nexus doesn't fleece them,"" said a BJP MLA. The CM is said to be examining details of the 2008 loan waiver scheme, sources said."

Citing the almost negligent increase of procurement price for paddy annually, Anbumani said that farmers would not have sought out loans if they had been paid the correct price for their produce.Terming Patel's statement as crude, the former Union health minister said that the RBI governor has no understanding of the ordeal that Indian farmers are going through. ""Without understanding the untold miseries of farmers in India, particularly in Tamil Nadu , the RBI governor is of the view that the assistance to farmers is of no use,"" said Anbumani in his statement released on Friday.Urjith had stated that the election promises made by political parties to waive crop loans should be revoked since it would have a negative impact on the economy.Stating that the low price for their produce was the reason farmers were in dire straits, Anbumani said, ""Farmers would not expect benefits if the government ensured a proper price for their produce. The recommendation made by M S Swaminathan to fix the procurement price at 50% more than the production cost has not been implemented so far"".Quoting the valuation of Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, Coimbatore, Anbumani had recommended Rs2324 for one quintal of paddy and Rs3675 for one tonne of sugarcane. However, he said, that the government set the prices at Rs1310 per quintal of paddy and Rs2100 per tonne of sugarcane. These prices are lower than the production cost, he said.Anbumani questioned how nationalized banks would deal with the bad debts caused by corporate companies. As of December 2016, this liabality stood at Rs6.14lakh crore. ""In an attempt to manage these bad debts, banks are taxing farmers,"" he said. Thus, the asked the Centre not to consider any suggestions made by the RBI governor, regarding issues pertaining to farmers.""Urjith Patel got a 280 % hike in salary. Such people cannot understand the difficulties faced by farmers who get only 3 % increase in procurement price every year,"" said Anbumani."
58f5f159a3d24b0b70c2659c,An Indian sub-prime crisis in the making?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/An-Indian-sub-prime-crisis-in-the-making/article17199320.ece,2017-02-04,"The Indian corporate sector is grappling with a severe bad debt crisis, and as a result, the banks (public sector banks) are increasingly getting saddled with non-performing assets. Calling it Indias sub-prime crisis might be an exaggeration but I would just like to add not yet! Moreover in conditions such as these, with the global economic crisis in the background, its better to be cautious rather than looking back at the data when its all over. This might also help policymakers to take regulatory steps in time to control the contagion before it spreads in the banking system in a big way.Lets look at the extent of the bad corporate debt. There are two statistics for a corporate house, which need to be looked at to understand the nature of the debt crisis. One is the amount of bank loans taken in a particular year and the other is whether the firms were financially healthy enough to take the loan in the first place.Healthy vs ponzi firmsThe latter is measured by whether they made enough profits in a particular period to even cover for the interest payments accrued on past debts. As we all know, any loan you take has two parts when the repayment starts: the principal (total loan amount) and the interest accrued on it. For a firm to be financially healthy, just as a family taking a loan, it should make enough profits to cover for both (in financial terms, these are called hedged firms). On the other hand, an unhealthy firm is one which does not even cover its interest payments (the ponzi firm). That the latter should not be given more loans is a no-brainer as that is a sure-shot recipe for disaster. At the heart of the U.S. sub-prime crisis was the fact that loans were dished out increasingly to ponzi households. Thats where the similarity lies. What was true for the household sector could be true for the corporate sector in India.In financial jargon, the health of a firm is measured by what is called the Interest Coverage Ratio (henceforth ICR). It is a ratio of net profits to interest payments due on past debt. It being less than 1 is a danger sign for the lender because it means that the firm is not even making enough profits to pay for its past interest payment commitments let alone the principal amount.We cover the period between 2011 and 2015 during which this process unfolded in India. We look first at a larger sample of corporate firms with consistent coverage available for these (and some other relevant variables) in the datasets available.ICR, best metric?One might doubt whether ICR is the best measure of financial health especially for companies which take longer to generate profits resulting from time lags that assets take to build. In anticipation of this criticism, I present three other variables to present a comprehensive picture of the current corporate debt crisis but interested readers can just look at the ICR to draw their conclusions.The three other measures are: profitability i.e. whether the firms were making positive post-tax profits; ratio of current assets to current liabilities to measure what part of the liabilities they can pay off if they were to sell their assets; debt to equity (own capital) ratio to measure how much have they stuck their own neck out compared to other peoples money in the risky adventure they are undertaking. The well-accepted thresholds for these measures are 0, 0.5 and 5 i.e. firms which are making negative profits, can honour at least half their liabilities by selling off the assets, while debt is five times as large as own capital respectively. The accompanying Figure 1 presents the share in the debt of such firms in the total sample debt with these individual characteristics over the years 2011-2015.It can be seen from the figure that the share of debt of firms with failing financial health has been going up since 2011. The dotted line represents how the share of bad debt has increased in those firms which could not even honour their interest commitments to the lenders and it has increased significantly since 2012. These are the ponzi firms we discussed above.Let us now look at something more specific with respect to some big sharks in this respect. We take a sample of four corporations out of the top 10 corporations (in terms of borrowing) identified by the Credit Suisse 2012 report on the House of Debt and follow their trajectory for the same time period as above. Instead of looking at the stock of debt, we focus now on new borrowings during these years because it is possible to argue that if you are not in a position to pay in full the interest accrued, then on that account alone the debt can keep piling up.What is significant here is that most of these firms were able to not only extract fresh borrowing from the banks but actually increase it even as their status continued to be ponzi! It is for this reason that I call it a potential sub-prime crisis building up.It can be seen from the Figure 3 that other than Vedanta Ltd., all companies have had at least two years of being in a ponzi state (ICR<1) and yet their borrowings, for most, have increased every year. Let me draw an analogy here. It shows that with increasing diabetic problems in a patient (ICR falling), doctors (banks) are injecting more of sugar (loans) to the body of the patient! Very high debt-equity ratios in the table also corroborates their bad health condition.Bank NPAsSo far we have seen the story from the culprits side. Let us briefly look at the problem from the side of the banks, which has got a lot of media attention especially since the then governor, Mr. Raghuram Rajan flagged this issue initially. As can be seen from Figure 2, most of the burden of bad loans since 2011 has been borne by public sector banks as opposed to the foreign banks or privately-owned banks. The share of stressed loans, which is the sum of non-performing loans and restructured loans, as a percentage of total advances made has been skyrocketing for public sector banks.In conclusion, while the banks have knowingly put themselves in the current position, the real culprits are the big borrowers and promoters who are not paying up as promised and the government, instead of being strict on the defaulters, is expecting the central bank to inject liquidity into the banking system to write off these bad loans. It would be travesty of justice if this were allowed to be done. It would just give a fillip to the habitual defaulters to default with impunity since the central bank will always be made to come in as the lender of last resort.(The author is a Visiting Scholar at the New School for Social Research and Columbia University and teaches at JNU.)Most of the burden of bad loans since 2011 has been borne by public sector banks as opposed to the foreign banks or privately-owned onesIf the ICR is less than 1, it means that the firm is not even making enough profits to pay for its past interest payment commitments"

Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made several big promises and assured delivery, the people look up to him with renewed optimism. Their appetite whetted, the masses expect them to be delivered soon.Moreover, since the BJP is now in power both at the Centre and in the state, its government cannot make any excuses if it fails to live up to its development promise. Here is a list of challenges before the BJP before 2019 Lok Sabha elections:The first challenge for the new government in Uttar Pradesh will be to assure all sections of the society that it is not vindictive to any community or caste.BJP had run an acrimonious election campaign in which its leaders, including Modi, attacked political opponents for appeasement of some castes (Yadavs in case of SP and Jatavs in case of BSP) and the Muslims. The party is also associated with the demolition of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya that led to the dismissal of the Kalyan Singh government.The BJP dispensation in UP must ensure that while it shuns appeasement, there is no discrimination.Kalyan Singh is still remembered as a chief minister who was effective in ensuring law and order and controlling the crime rate. He had also posted honest cops and bureaucrats in key posts. The people would expect this from the new BJP government.Since Modi has also promoted talent in the bureaucracy, both as chief minister and as PM, expectations are high in UP. Land grabbing by mafias, security of women and other crimes are major concerns. Akhilesh Yadav woke up only after the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and tried to sell the Agra-Lucknow Expressway  the deadline was met in a jiffy  and the Lucknow metro Both the projects are still half-baked. The condition of state highways and roads in cities and towns of UP is worse than neighbouring states, including Bihar. This must be a priority area for the BJP.UP would arguably have the most number of closed sugar mills and most disenchanted sugarcane growers. The state still lags behind in industrialisation, with lack of adequate power being one of the reasons. UP is a laggard when it comes to industrialisation. This is also a reason for migration of youth to other states for employment.Modi had promised that the first decision of the BJP government in UP will be waiver of all farm debts and loans. With the BJP declaring that the welfare of the poor and rural folk are its topmost priorities and its outreach to the OBCs and Dalits, development of the hinterland cannot be ignored."

The products were allegedly made of soyabean oil. Health department officials said that the truck had been coming from Khairtal and heading towards Phulera. The police intercepted the vehicle and immediately informed the health department officials. The team of food safety officers reached the spot immediately to check its quality.Health department officials said that the seized kalakand is adulterated. It is sold at Rs130 per kg to retailers. The retailers sold it at Rs350 per kg.Officials said that it should be made of only milk and sugar. But, in this case, it is suspected that the manufacturer has used soyabean oil and skimmed milk powder. ""We have collected samples of kalakand and sent it to laboratory for testing,"" the official said.Transpiration of Kalakand in huge quantity in a truck put it in suspicion. The police suspected that it requires a lot of milk to produce such a huge quality of kalakand.Earlier, food safety officers inspected mawa manufacturing units in Chitwari in Chomu area and collected seven samples.It took almost whole day for the health department officials to inspect the mawa manufacturing units in the village as almost each and every house in the village is engaged in producing mawa.A health department official said that Chitwari is a village, which has 900 houses. ""We have taken seven samples of mawa from Chitwari,"" a health department official said.However, officials claimed that they have not found any evidences of adulteration in the mawa during the inspection but they have taken the samples for quality testing.The food safety officers were conducting inspection when they received information from the Kotputli police about the vehicle carrying 20tons of Kalakand.Chitwari village totally depends on mawa production. Almost each house in the village is linked to mawa production.The prominent markets for Chitwari village are Jaipur, Chomu and also some places in Sikar. The daily requirement of mawa in Jaipur is approximately 60,000 kg. Chitwari supply around 15-20,000 kg."

The federation representatives said the stir would continue as discussions with the government, pressing for various demands had failed. Essential commodities such as milk, water, vegetables and medicines are exempted from the strike.One of the main demands of truck operators is withdrawal of additional VAT on fuel announced recently by the state. Truckers also demand that the government repeal the hike in license renewal and fitness certificate fees and increase in third party insurance premium announced by the Centre. The strike is on in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Puducherry, said Kumaraswamy, president of the federation. He was talking to reporters at the Secretariat after holding discussions with the state transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar.Out of 4.5 lakh trucks and goods carriers currently running in the state, 80 per cent of the vehicles had gone off roads on day one of the strike, said Kumaraswamy. He said truck owners had instructed their drivers to bring back vehicles that had gone to northern parts of the country without any load.V R Soundararajan, advisor to the Koyambedu Vegetable Market Vendors' Association, said that 350 trucks bring supplies to the market from various districts and neighbouring states daily. ""The impact of the strike on business will be known only on Friday or Saturday. Small vehicles that bring vegetables from within the state might operate. But if the strike continues, vegetables from other states will not come and prices of fruits and vegetables will increase,"" he said.The ongoing drought has already shrunk regular supply of vegetables and fruits resulting in hike in prices.

I don't need to scream it out. If I need to spell it out, I won't only because I live in a country where I could possibly be jailed for saying this. Which is why I, Karan Johar, will not say the three words that possibly everybody knows about me in any case"".Several of the city's LGBTQI activists believe the filmmaker's logic, instead of hitting out at the archaic laws, would allow homosexuals to be browbeaten and extorted. In some cases, they felt, it might even derail plans to come out of the closet.""He has diluted the basic rights of the queer movement by wrongly highlighting the imprisonment clause with his irresponsible comment,"" said choreographer Sudarshan Chakraborty, adding a person could never be arrested in India for just coming out as gay or lesbian. ""By dragging the legal issue involving Section 377 IPC, KJo has jeopardised the queer movement. Coming out as gay or lesbian doesn't mean a person can be arrested. He/she can be ostracised. This section criminalises sexual activities 'against the order of nature',"" Chakraborty felt. ""But after such statements, people like me who have come out can become easy targets of abuse,"" he rued.Activist Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee feels Johar's statement was ""regressive"". ""It is a big jolt to the community when KJo says he won't say those three words for fear of imprisonment.... To this say this is a way of giving in to sexual fundamentalism,"" Chatterjee said.Malobika, co-founder of Sappho for Equality, believes such statements might give a false sense of ""empowerment"" to people who want to harass people who want to come out. ""This is a big disservice to the movement,"" she said. ""He has put forth an incorrect view on a legal position. If we were to believe him, those who have said it, including myself, would have all been in jail now.... Because of his socio-economic and locational position, he has been too detached from the man on the street and his struggles.""Gender and sexuality activist Pawan Dhal expressed disinterest. ""I don't like coffee with either sugar, milk or Karan. I don't think it is important to discuss what he said. The movement is not going to gain or lose anything because of his words,"" Dhal said.KJo also has some support  notably from fashion designer Nil. ""No one owes a responsibility to come out.

His company, Avani Eco, produces goods including cassava carrier bags, takeaway food containers made from sugar cane and straws fashioned from corn starch, which founder Kevin Kumala says degrade relatively quickly and dont leave any toxic residue.Im an avid diver and surfer, and Im out there seeing this plastic pollution in front of my very eyes, says Mr. Kumala, explaining why he decided to get into the business of biodegradable plastics, known as bioplastics.More plastic than fishAfter witnessing the pollution around Bali, he insists tackling the problem is something that needs to be done. His project comes at a critical time for action on the issue. A 2016 report by the Ellen MacArthur foundation warned that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean, measuring by weight.At the World Economic Forum in Davos this January, 40 of the worlds biggest companies agreed to come up with cleaner ways to make and use the material.In Indonesia, the waves of plastic flooding into rivers and oceans have been causing problems for years  waterways in cities become clogged, increasing the risk of floods, as well death and injury to marine animals who eat or become trapped in plastic packaging.The archipelago of over 17,000 islands is one of the worst offenders when it comes to marine littering, with U.S. charity Oceans Conservancy estimating the country dumps the second-highest amount of plastic into the sea, behind only China.Mr. Kumala set up Avani Eco several years ago with its headquarters on Bali and a main factory on Java island, and the biodegradable goods went on sale in 2015.The most popular product is the bags made from cassava  an edible tropical root that is cheap and abundant in Indonesia  with the words I am not plastic emblazoned on them.The entrepreneur, who is a biology graduate, is happy to demonstrate the bags are not harmful  he put some of the cassava bag material into a glass of hot water, watched it quickly dissolve, and then gulped down the resulting concoction. It gives hope to sea animals, they are no longer choking or ingesting something that could be hazardous, he said.About three tonnes of the bags are produced a day at the Java factory and sold to businesses including shops and hotel groups, mostly in Bali and across Indonesia, but also to a growing number of companies abroad.A small priceBeing environmentally friendly does cost however, with a cassava bag typically about Rs. 2 more expensive than a plastic bag.The material for the other products Avani Eco sells are sourced in Indonesia, but some items are currently made in China as it is more cost effective to do so  though this does add to their carbon footprint. Mr. Kumala says the final products can degrade in just a matter of months, unlike the years required for conventional plastic to break down.However other bioplastics have long been on the market, and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has expressed scepticism about the industry. The UN body concluded in a 2015 report that they tended to be more expensive and were unlikely to play a major role in reducing marine litter.Bioplastics are defined as plastics made from materials such as corn starch and vegetable fats and oil, while common plastics are made from natural gas or petroleum.UNEP senior official Habib El-Habr, who works on protecting the marine environment, said bioplastics were innovative solutions that could be part of a long-term solution, but added: We dont know enough about this technology.He said the UN body favoured the management of plastic through such strategies as working with big companies.Still Indonesia needs all the help it can get to deal with its waste. Current rubbish collection and disposal systems are inadequate to deal with rising plastic use.Despite the challenges, Mr. Kumala is upbeat that Indonesias plastic scourge can be tackled and has plans to expand to other countries in the region.He explained: The whole of Asia is really drowning in an ocean of plastic pollution.  AFPTakeaway containers made of sugar cane and straws of corn starch are some of the other innovations"

In the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, this dominant community  swept away by communal frenzy following the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013  had played a critical role in the BJPs stunning electoral victory.Today, two-and-a-half years later, vestiges of hatred lurk beneath the picturesque sugarcane and mustard fields of western U.P. that turn the landscape green and gold in this season. But passions have cooled and the Jats have had time to think. Angered by the BJP-led governments failure to grant the community reservation and devastated by demonetisation, they are now repenting deserting the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the family of their hero, Chaudhury Charan Singh.Failed effortsJats are so incensed that last Tuesday, BJP president Amit Shah was compelled to call a meeting of community leaders at the residence of Union Minister Chaudhury Birender Singh, a Jat leader from neighbouring Haryana. But the dinner diplomacy failed to pacify the guests. A day later, another BJP Jat leader and Union Minister of State and MP from Muzaffarnagar, Sanjiv Balyan, was asked to engage the community in Meerut. Reports suggest this effort, too, was unsuccessful.Pushpinder Choudhury, who heads the politically unaffiliated Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, says this development means that the RLD is back in business. Jats will vote tactically to defeat the BJP. They will vote not just for Jat candidates or RLD candidates but also for whoever can defeat the BJP, he told The Hindu.That may be an exaggerated claim as a small section of Jats, especially those affiliated to the BJP, younger men in particular, will remain with the party. Reports coming in from western U.P. say the BJP  and organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)  have, in the closing days of the campaign, attempted to reintroduce emotive Hindutva issues relating to the theft of cattle and molestation of Hindu girls. The promise to form anti-Romeo squads (another name for the love jihad campaign) is officially in the manifesto. As one farmer leader put, Once the official campaigning closes, electioneering will continue on WhatsApp and Facebook.Onkar Singh, an RSS functionary from the Dharam Jagran Samanway in Muzaffarnagar, told The Hindu : Its a straight contest between the SP-Congress combine and the BJP. But once people start seeing the long lines of Muslims, the Hindus will all vote BJP.RLD factorConversations with members of all political parties in the fray suggest that the RLD could win anything between four and nine of the 73 seats, spread across 15 districts, going to the polls on February 11. But the fact that the party is now a player means that it will be a four-way contest  the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress combine, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the BJP and the RLD  making the outcome that much harder to predict.Clear choiceAnother significant community in this part of the State, the Muslims, are squarely behind the SP-Congress combine, as the two parties are most likely to provide them security, something they currently prize above development. The alliance, too, has given the SP a boost, with joint rallies in the region receiving rapturous receptions.Muslims will, however, vote for the BSP wherever the alliance candidate is weak. This could place the latter party in a position of advantage in some seats, as the Dalit votes are sizeable here.The BJP will clearly do better than it did in 2012 when it won just 11 of these 73 seats, but it appears unlikely to be anywhere comparable to their performance in 2014, when they won two-thirds of the Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha seats here. The BJP, SP-Congress and BSP sources all claim they are leading in the first phase, but political observers agree that it will be a direct fight between the BJP and the SP-Congress combine, with the BSP at No. 3.The RLD has a fighting chance in four to nine seats in the first phase of the polls on February 11"

They wanted the amount to be enhanced to at least Rs 15,000 crore which could be disbursed to all needy farmers.The Rs 137 crore announced as 'Ways and Means Advance (WMA)' to sugarcane farmers had already been distributed to cane growers last year. Instead, there was no mention about the remaining Rs 117 crore to be released to them, they alleged. However, the farmers welcomed the announcement to set up Farmers Producer Group which would enable them to get the required price for their produce. Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam , affiliated to CPI, said that Tamil Nadu was reeling under severe drought and the entire farm lands were being kept vacant. ""In these circumstances, how can the government attain the target of 100 lakh tonnes of food grains for 2017-18,"" asked Sangam district secretary Ayilai Siva Suriyan. He ridiculed the announcement that 3.5 lakh ""economically weaker"" farmers would get free plots saying only the numbers had changed as similar schemes were being announced every year. ""Had the scheme been implemented effectively every year, almost all beneficiaries in Tamil Nadu would have been residing in their own houses today,"" he stated.Crop loan allocation should be raised to at least Rs 15,000 crore to be disbursed to all needy farmers, said secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan. ""Minister P Thangamani had earlier said that there will not be power cuts anymore as the state has surplus energy. If this was true, why didn't they start providing new power connections for irrigation purposes to the farmers as the scheme had been suspended since 2010"", he asked. However, he said that farmers wholeheartedly welcomed the announcement of setting up Farmers Producer Group.Raja Chidambaram, general secretary of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam, Perambalur described the budget as a mirage as everything was remaining only on paper and in reality no farmer would benefit. ""Minister said that the area of sugarcane cultivated earlier has come down due to water shortage. But the reason behind it is non-settlement of dues by sugar mills in crores of rupees. So, the government should sanction the required fund to the ten cooperative and two public sector sugar mills in the state"", he stated.Without allotting fund for establishing the required infrastructure and strengthening the existing ones, the government would not attain the target of producing 100 lakh tonnes of food grains, says the president of Cauvery Delta Farmers Association Cauvery S Dhanapalan. He added that 36,000 water bodies and 24,000 kilometres of water ways had to be desilted and bunds strengthened across delta districts alone.""Out of one rupee allotted for agriculture sector, 0.65 paise is spent for salary while the remaining 0.35 paise goes for free power, incentives and insurance schemes. Nothing remains for the development of agriculture.,"" he said and demanded that 65 per cent of the budget allocation be set apart for agriculture.Puliyur A Nagarajan, state organizer of the farmers' wing of Tamil Manila Congress , expressed disappointment at the budget and accused the finance minister of neglecting the drought situation prevailing in the state and the plight of farmers. ""Farmers in the drought-hit state have for long been demanding waiver of all crop loans sanctioned by nationalised banks. But the budget has not mentioned a word about that"", he said."

And this is only a conservative figure coming from the government. If one goes by the figures provided by farmers' associations, the number would swell to 6-7 suicides per day. The record heat and drought of 2017 could spell disaster for the farming community in the state, which has already seen 848 suicides in 2016-17, until February.Karnataka witnessed a record 1,478 suicides in 2015-16 due to severe shortage of rainfall, which put farmers in distress. They were unable to get desired prices for their produce and were neck-deep in debt with nationalised banks and private moneylenders. Regardless of what political parties may have said, the disturbing trend has proved beyond doubt that agriculture is no more a profitable venture.Getting back to governance after a fortnight full of bypoll politics, the Siddaramaiah government has a daunting task at hand of maintaining stability in the face of a severe drought. Even though the state government is trying to make agriculture profitable, estimates by the Karnataka State Agriculture Prices Commission indicate that it's far from so.The North Karnataka districts witnessed the highest suicides last year. This year, the cloud has moved over to the Malnad areas as several reservoirs here are dry since the monsoon failed and the groundwater plummeted.While Haveri district has topped the list with 86 suicides, Dharwad district witnessed 73. The coffee-growing district of Chikka-magaluru saw 70 suicides, followed by Mysuru and Mandya with 50 and 51 suicides, respectively. Both Mysuru and Mandya depend on Cauvery River for agriculture.Four consecutive years of drought are already weighing down on Karnataka's farmers. And now, reckless use of groundwater to compensate for the poor monsoon has only made things worse for them. The state budget, which made no mention of a loan-waiver, came as a huge disappointment for them.Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president of the sugarcane growers association, said: ""The government should have planned to prevent suicides. It failed to learn from last year's mistakes and the result is that even this year, there have been suicides. In less than one-and-a -half-years, as per our estimate, close to 3,000 farmers have committed suicide across Karnataka. Our only demand is that the government must stop loan recovery and waive off the loan. Shivanna (52) of Mandya district committed suicide when bank authorities slapped notices on him for the repayment of a loan of Rs 5 lakh. His entire paddy crop had perished as there was no water in the Cauvery basin this year.""While Siddaramaiah has made it clear that the Centre should waive the loan, farmers have a different understanding of the logic. ""If he (the CM) can give others, why can't he give to us? The CM claims that he cannot waive off the loan, but he has money to appoint a pay commission to revise the salaries of state government employees, which runs into several crores. If the exchequer is short of money, what was the reason for the government to procure new vehicles for presidents of zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat? What was binding on the government to increase the salary of MLAs, MLCs and ministers? Farmers and agriculture are not a priority for this government and it has been proved time and again,"" said Shanthakumar.Besides estimating that growing several crops would actually leave a farmer in loss, the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission has attributed the continuing trend of farmer suicides to demonetisation and unscientific cropping pattern.TN Prakash Kammaradi, chairman of the com-mi-ssion, said: ""Demo-ne-tisation has literally taken money out of markets. Because of this, there is no purchase of produce in the market. When there is no purchase in market, how can you ensure profit for farmers?""""The centre should have been more proactive in this regard rather than leaving things entirely to the states. Instead, it is going in for zero duty import of pulses and sugar, which will be detrimental to our farmers.""Rather than importing, the same money should have been diverted and given to farmers as a minimum support price (MSP). Centre's policies are driven by inflation and consumer interests rather than to benefit farmers,"" he said.Prakash also opined that the unscientific cropping pattern and season-bound production of crops has also resulted in severe losses.""In some regions, farmers take to the cultivation of just one crop, resulting in excess production and fall in prices. Under favourable conditions, all farmers in Kalaburagi go after tur dal or farmers in Kolar flood the market with tonnes of tomatoes. We need to have a proper cropping plan and farmers have to stick to such rules to get effective prices for their produce,"" he said.Considering the market fluctuation until December 2016, the Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission has estimated loss and profit per acre for cultivation of each crop across Karnataka. As per the report, cultivating several staple crops would actually result in losses for farmers.Even though a few crops bring in profits, it would be insignificant. Cultivating several crops such as paddy, ragi (finger millet), foxtail millet, urad dal, sunflower, and coconut has only caused losses."

The village, where Siddaramaiah was born and brought up, had cheered his ascension as chief minister only four years ago. Today, it's in the grip of a severe drought that has left no walk of life untouched.So severe is the crisis that Ramapura and Varuna canals, which provide water to the fields of Siddaramanahundi, about 24km from Mysuru, are running dry. This has forced villagers to shift from their staple sugarcane and paddy crop to millet, that is less water-intensive. Borewells dug by the gram panchayat too have gone dry, leaving the villagers nowhere to go to meet the water requirements for agricultural activities.GP member Girish L said six borewells drilled recently have been of no help as the groundwater table has plummeted. ""We used to get water at a depth of 100ft-150ft, but we now have to dig deeper than 200ft. Only those with their own borewells are cultivating sugarcane and paddy,"" he rued.The village, though, isn't staring at a drinking water crisis. Manjunath H, a local leader, said, ""The multi-village water supply scheme provides drinking water to 39 villages, including Siddaramanahundi. Water is pumped from Kapila river and stored in an overhead tank,"" he said.The panchayat arranges for water tankers when the tank becomes empty. The rural development and panchayat raj department has set up the D Devaraj Urs drinking water unit, wherein villagers can get 20 litres of water for Rs 2.Drought has also hit dairy farming and cattle raring. With the absence of water affecting the milk yield, the villagers are vociferously demanding a fodder bank.Siddaramanahundi has concrete roads, a government hospital, post office, government primary and high school, pre-university college, boys' hostel, police outpost, under-construction library, Kaveri Grameena Bank and SBM branches, thanks to its high-profile son.Box: Panchayat members elatedThough most villagers were not glued to their TV sets watching the budget presentation, a motley group of leaders was seen cheering Siddaramaiah's speech on TV at the panchayat office. ""The increase in allowances for panchayat members and office-bearers is a welcome decision. But the CM should have sanctioned funds for a cricket stadium of international standards in Mysuru. That would have given a boost to the airport and allied activities,"" Manjunath said."

After being ambushed, the cola giant is trying to get its game back in the state by engaging the retailers, even as it opens channels of communication with the traders body and with the government through Indian beverages Association. In a conversation with TOI, Shiv Shivakumar, chairman & CEO, India region, Pepsico speaks of the company's stand on the issue and of a transformation in its portfolio. Excerpts:Q)What do you have to say on the whole uprising against Pepsi in Tamil Nadu with the retailers stopping the sale of Coke & Pepsi since March 1?First, we want to clarify that we have no association whatsoever with PeTA, which was a petitioner against the Jallikattu. We were surprised to find that we got dragged into the protests and that our products were asked to be banned.Q) What has been the effect of the ban on your sales or strategy towards the state?A) There has not been a major reduction in sale, while there have been instances of few retailers stopping orders. However, Tamil Nadu is an important market for us where we have investing for the last 27 years and we will continue to actively invest in the state. Our channel continues to remain the same.Q) There are allegations that you draw excessive water?I also would clarify that we return more water than we consume for manufacturing. We are water positive for the last eight years. On a national level, we have returned 12.75 billion litres in 2015, through various conservation and replenishment initiatives. In Tamil Nadu, we have returned close to 1.5 billion litres of water in 2015, with our water recharge, water rejuvenation and DSR initiatives. However, we have consumed only 1/3 of it.Q) Are you trying to alter the negative perception about the company that gained strength since the protests and the subsequent ban?We are working with the Indian Beverage Association. We are constantly trying to change the consumer and retailer perception and have so far. We have organised 10 retailer meets since the uprising. We have been educating them on the initiatives we take. They seem convinced are happy with the service we have provided so far.Q) With the Patanjali onslaught, there is an Ayurveda and herbal wave in the FMCG space. Are you tweaking your products to counter it?A) Our product portfolio is changing and we are betting big on the health consciousness of the urban nuclear families that are time strapped. In the soft drink segment, we have introduced a low sugar product. We are rolling out a new variant of 7UP that has 30% less sugar (using Stevia extract), in phases starting with Gujarat. For our Oats-based brand Quaker, we have introduced a whole line of Desi variants such as Oats upma, Poha, Dosa etc. They are priced at a 10-15% premium compared to MTR. However, with 40% oats content, the taste differs significantly from the remaining brands. Besides the shift towards healthy eating, we are also helping farmers by increasing our domestic supply of potatoes and citrus fruits for the beverage and snacks categories. Currently, 65% of our sourcing is done locally for fruits including pomegranate, litchi etc. The company will increase the supply of citrus fruits and potatoes as well.Q) What is your projection for the summer of 2017?Early trends show that this summer is going to be good. We predict a growth compared to last summer."

For, the city's consumption of honey is 80 times more than the country's average, which is a mere 8.4 gm, according to figures given by the city-based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).""People in this city are health conscious, and it seems they have added honey to their daily diet,"" says Donald Tais, in-charge of the CBRTI parlour at Shivajinagar here.High school teacher Sandip Pokale has replaced jam with honey while enjoying a slice or two of bread. A regular visitor to the CBRTI parlour, he says, ""I have added honey to my regular diet because of its multiple medicinal properties. It has given me positive results.""General physician Neelesh Wadnap also vouches for the health benefits of consuming honey. ""Honey can be used for curing certain coughs. The pure form of honey can be used as a natural sugar but many a times the quality of the honey is not up to the mark. Honey with warm water has multiple benefits like cleaning the bowels.""Enthused by the health properties of the sugary food substance, Puneities have been making a beeline for the CBRTI honey parlour, forcing the authorities to ask for replenishments.""Our sale has been consistent for the last two years,"" says Tais. Experts say the reason people prefer buying honey from the CBRTI parlour is because it is certified by Agmark, a government agency , which caters to a set of standards approved by the Directorate of Marketing and Inspection. ""We take conscious efforts to maintain the quality of honey as per stan dards,"" says CBRTI assistant director R K Singh. The parlour keeps four different types of honey which mainly come from Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and the Melghat tribal areas in Maharashtra.Pune's voracious appetite for honey is borne out by these figures. In 2015-16, the per capita consumption of honey was 430gm, while this financial year (till December 2016) it rose to 686gm. In comparison, the per capita consumption of honey in developed countries is 1,200gm.In 2015-16, Puneites consumed 12,766 kg of honey worth Rs 46.52 lakh. While from April 2016 till December 2016, the consumption was 8,007 kg valued at Rs 29 lakh, according to CBRTI."

In 2013, the four common non-communicable diseases - cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, accounted for 3.1 million premature deaths constituting 55% of mortality in that year in the age group at 30-69 years.India has the second largest number of tobacco users (275 million or 35% of all adults in India) in the world and of these at least 10 lakh die every year from tobacco-related diseases.Tobacco-related diseases kill about 2,500 Indians daily. It is estimated that about 5,500 youth and children (as young as 8 years old), initiate tobacco use daily, according to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey.While the Union health ministry has been trying to reduce tobacco consumption by stringent advertisement norms, pictorial warnings as well as higher taxes, of late it has also focused efforts towards reducing intake of food products high on salt and fats as well as sugary beverages."

Now, the component for setting up vodka plant and distillery unit has been removed from the proposal.The revised proposal now presents intent of SBM group to set up mega food park project for establishment of mineral water plant.

Two young officers who were sacked last year for failing to clear the 'swimming' and 'cross-country race"" tests as part of the IPS foundation course, were reinstated last month after they, on being allowed a second chance, managed to clear the two key physical fitness papers.Similarly, while one 2015 batch IPS probationer having weight issues has been issued show-cause notice for failing to pass the ""cross country race"" test, two probationers from the 2016 batch, one of whom was found overweight and another showed a high blood sugar level, had to make do with a provisional medical fitness certificate. The two were asked to work on reducing their body mass index and blood sugar to permissible levels before being declared ""medically fit"" for confirmation as IPS officers.Kusum Punia, a 2010 batch IPS officer belonging to Jharkhand cadre, was discharged from service last year, even as she was on probation, for failing to clear two of the 14-15 papers that make up the basic course for IPS probationers at the National Police Academy. Sources said Punia was sacked as she did not respond to repeated pleas and multiple opportunities to take the two tests.Another 2011 batch IPS probationer from the West Bengal cadre, Kumar Gautam , was sacked along with Punia last year for not clearing the mandatory cross-country test paper.However, after they filed a plea seeking a second chance, Union home minister Rajnath Singh, taking a compassionate view in the light of their humble family background, allowed them to be reinstated but on the condition that they clear the remaining papers of NPA course. Both Punia and Gautam reappeared for the said papers and having passed them, will now be confirmed as IPS officers.Sources said the initial action against Punia and Gautam has sent a strong message among IPS probationers who tend to take their foundation course at NPA lightly. ""The probationers now realise that they will have to face the implications if they fail to clear all the papers in the course,"" said a senior officer of the home ministry, which is the cadre-controlling authority for IPS officers.A 2015 batch IPS officer of Maharashtra cadre, meanwhile, has been slapped a show-cause notice on why he should not be discharged from service for failing to clear the cross-country test paper, which is mandatory for confirmation as an IPS officer. Sources said though he has appeared for the test more than once, he could not clear it as he has weight issues and collapses while running.At least two IPS probationers from the 2016 batch at NPA had to wait before being declared medically fit ahead of confirmation. While one of them was found to have a body mass index of 32.15, way above the internationally acceptable standard, another was found to have a high sugar content in his blood.Both were given time to cut their BMI and blood sugar level and made to reappear for a second medical test after a few months. It was only after they satisfied the maximum BMI and sugar level criteria that they were declared medically fit, paving the way for their confirmation.""The underlying principle behind insisting on physical fitness of IPS probationers is that they should be ready to meet the high fitness levels demanded by a career in the police services,"" said an officer.

A total of 371.4 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane was crushed in 147 mills across the state producing 417 lakh quintal of sugar. These figures are even lower than in 2008, when another severe drought had hit Maharashtra Officials say the price of sugar is expected to rise owing to the shortfall in production. Maharashtra is one of the largest producers of sugar in the country.""This has been an exceptionally difficult year with the losses mounting. This is bound to have a cascading effect next year,"" said a senior official from the state sugar mills association. Sugar retail prices are hovering around Rs 38-40 as against the normal prices of Rs 32-34.The worse-hit at the moment are the sugarcane farmers, who have lost income to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore due to low production. The area under sugarcane cultivation shrank to 6.3 lakh hectares in 2015-16 due to the drought from 10.3 lakh hectares the year before. Thus the total sugarcane production in 2016 was 4.5 lakh metric tonnes against a total harvest of 7.3 lakh metric ton in 2015.The dip in sugarcane production is due to the drought in 2015 . Sugarcane is an 18-month crop and the cane sown in 2015 was harvested in the end of 2016.With one tonne sugarcane said to be fetching a minimum of Rs 2,000 for the farmers, even by conservative estimates they have made losses worth Rs 6,000 crore, say industry experts.They add that the total agriculture loss due to the severe drought in 2015 cannot be accounted for, but losses will continue to impact the farmers indirectly. Last year, a total of 178 sugar factories were operational; this year 31 didn't even start operations due to lack of raw material. And 120 of the 147 that were working shut in January.Most of the mills are situated in the sugarcane belt of western Maharashtra and Marathwada.

Being overweight and obese constitutes the fifth highest risk factor for adult deaths. ""Obesity causes both direct and indirect damage to kidneys. It is also recognised as a risk factor for kidney stones, and for kidney cancer.People, who are overweight or obese, have two-seven times more chances of developing end-stage renal disease compared to those of normal weight,"" the statement says.Dr Mohammed A Rafey , senior consultant nephrologist and hypertension specialist, Apollo Hospitals , Hyderguda, says diabetes remains the most common cause of kidney failure. With increasing prevalence in the city, patients with kidney disease are expected to rise. Doctors are reporting higher incidence of kidney failure in young patients too due to hypertension and protein loss in urine.According to senior nephrol ogist Dr Ravi Kumar of MaxCure Hospitals, diets rich in sodium and carbohydrates have been found to be one of the reasons for kidney ailments in children. ""About 20 paediatric kidney stone cases are reported every year in our hospital. This is due to food habits and environmental changes. These cases are seen mostly in the age group of three to 12 years. There is a 10fold increase of this condition every year,"" he adds.Dr Dilip M Babu, consultant nephrologist, blames kidney diseases on uncontrolled blood sugars and blood pressure. ""Uncontrolled blood sugars and high prevalence of diabetes in Hyderabad is predominantly due to rice-eating and non-vegetarian (red meat) population,"" he says. Dr Sanjay Maitra, senior consultant nephrologist, said, ""about 30-65% of the urban population is either overweight or obese in India and Hyderabad is no exception."""

The slang has different versions such as Kidu, Mass, Killer, Soooooper, Ugrogran and so on...Rashi Bash (Rashid Basheer) a youngster from Fort Kochi tells us, ""It is not just super but soooooper! The effect is more as the number of 'o's increase. Same is the difference between Polichu and Pwolich.""Salute to the meme-fied world! The teens are now more into short forms and crisp communication! Yes, the elders call it laziness but the youthans don't care!""It serves our purpose. We can communicate easily than with elaborate dialogues. When we say, ""Bro nee muthanu..."" it expresses all the love I have for my Changayi,"" says Sha Mon (Shamil Muhammed) from Calicut.The word Sakhave which means comrade was the most used slang by the youngsters of Kerala from the pre-independence-era till the beginning of the 2010s. However, the word which suggested a friend who is a communist was later used for just any friend. The term then underwent different transformations and became Aliya , Changayi, Buddy and Bro. The latest in thefield is Saho.While a teen used to say Kolamayallo and Alambayallo to convey a totally messed up situation, the bros now use Scenanallo and Pani paali. ""I remember my bros using Alamabayallo while talking to friends. Now we use different words in different contexts. If the situation is bad but okay-to-handle kind we say Scenanallo buddy, depending on the intensity of the situation, we use Kaboor scena, Flippanallo, Scene contra and Bro level maripoi, Aliya pani paali,"" says Rashi Bash.Thanks to new-age films, there are many slangs that have become popular and which is now very commonly used by the Malayali youngsters across the world. ""The Thomas Kutty vittoda inspired us to use code language which can be understood only by people of our age. So to escape from a scene, we tell each other, Scoot ayikko machane, Escape itto, Stand vitto illel sketch veezhum and so on,"" says Sha Mon.Love has no language, they say, but the youth here beg to differ. ""We have our own codes and words to express our 'Lub' to our Mwonchathi!"" If their dads used to address their lover as Anuragini or Priyathame, the new age terms of endearment are Mwonjathi and Panjasaara.""""Love is a beautiful feeling and it should be expressed in our own way. We don't mind a little Painkilitharam when it comes to addressing our love. What is sweeter than Panjasaara? Why not call my love sugar?"" asks Rashi."

The water-dependent industries such as liquor and beer manufacturers are likely to hit badly. Many of them may even have to shut their units,"" said Kavali V R, senior geologist at Kar nataka Groundwater Directorate The manufacturers have already been facing scarcity of raw material, molasses, a byproduct of sugar. The production of sugarcane has been low due to drought. Experts expect at least 45 per cent dip in Indian-made liquor (ILM) and beer production.""It's going to be a low-production year for the liquor industry. If remedial measuresX are not taken at the earliest, the production of IML and beer will come down not less than 45 per cent,"" said Shivalingaiah, secretary general of Karnataka Brewers and Distillers Association.Karnataka has 33 distilleries manufacturing IML and three breweries producing beer. On an average, 45 lakh cases of ILM are being pro duced a month (each contains 8.4 litres of IML) and 20 lakh cases of beer (each containing 6.5 litre). While IML needs 60 per cent of water and 40 per cent rectified spirit produced by molasses, 90 per cent of water is required for beer production. A rough estimate suggest over 2.5 crore litres of water for IML and another 5 crore litre for beer production.An official in the ground water directorate said the static level of groundwater had already gone to 1,200 feet in and around Bengaluru, while the average level is 400 feet. Elsewhere, like in Kolar, the situation is even worse and water level has further gone down to touch 1,800 feet.According to Rakshit N Jagadale, director of Amrut Distilleries Limited , the major issue is quality of water. ""The groundwater level has gone down, so has quality . The liquor manufactures will have to spend more on purification of water through the ion-exchange process and de-mineralization,"" Jagadale said.He said while his distillery requires 60,000 litres of water a month, most of it is being supplied by borewells. ""If there's shortage, we need to procure from outside,"" he added.However, K L A Padmanabha Sa Khoday , joint managing director of Khoday India Ltd , a prominent beer manufacturer, said the situation is not out of control so far and his company would have to opt for a contingency plan if needed.Even the excise department is worried about the dry spell staring at the state since the short supply of liquor would hurt its revenue. The department is among the few which withstood the impact of demonetization. The revenue collection through liquor sales touched Rs 14,500 crore as of February-end, as against the annual target of Rs 16, 510 for 2016-17."

A new study conducted abroad, which is being followed with case-controlled studies in India, promises this possibility. In this experimental treatment module, also referred to as Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD), patients with early onset diabetes are not given medication but are put on a controlled diet  reducing daily calorie intake by less than half of normal diet  for rapid weight loss.""The VLCD diet aims to achieve benefits of a bariatric surgery without operation. We have tried it on some patients but failed to achieve desired results since no one could follow up with diet chart for long enough,"" Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology. Dr Sujeet Jha, who heads the endocrinology division at Max hospital Saket, said they have also tried it on some patients.""A 48-year-old patient who was diagnosed with early onset diabetes came to us recently with a specific request that he didn't want to take lifelong medications to control the disease. We have put him on VLCD diet. It will be too early to discuss results,"" he said.While a normal diet contains 1600 to 1800 calories, diabetologists say VLCD attempts to bring down calorie intake to 600 to 800 calories. Research on its effectiveness, which has been published in a recent issue of medical journal Diabetes Care, states that VLCD for a significant duration helps remove excess fat from the pancreas. ""This allows beta cells to return to producing normal levels of insulin in response to glucose,"" it states.Dr Jha said following VLCD is a tough task. ""Calorie reduction is needed but at the same time we have to ensure that the patient gets enough protein, vitamin and minerals. Regular tests to check kidney and liver function is also essential,"" he added.In the study carried out by researchers from Newcastle University, University of Glasgow, and Lagos University, 30 diabetics were put on VLCD for eight weeks. It consisted of diet shakes and non-starchy vegetables. Out of 30 people, 12 had normal insulin levels after eight weeks and similar results were seen even after six months.""It is too early to predict the utility of the VLCD for diabetes reversal in all patients. We need larger studies and more scientific data to make such claims,"" Dr Jha said.The research could best be described as a ray of hope for millions suffering from the disease who have to be on lifelong medication to maintain blood sugar levels. In obese patients with diabetes, surgery is shown some benefits, he added."

But the steady stream of relatives and friends and the grim look on their faces had left her in doubt whether all was well.A white Maruti Omni bearing the insignia of an ambulance, dashed her hopes. Her husband, Narayanaswamy , broke the news to her that their son had been murdered, as he held her and took her near the ambulance. As Harsha's body was stretchered out, Annapurna broke into a wail and collapsed. Hemaraj, a close family relative who was arranging everything for the bereaved family, told TOI that they had no go but to hold back the news till Harsha's body reached home.""She is a BP and sugar patient. Had we broken the news on Monday itself, controlling her would have become difficult,"" he said.Family members had ensured that cable TV had been disconnected, lest Annapurna saw the news and learnt about her son's death.""She had sensed it. This morning, I gave Annapurna some biscuits and tea, and she told me that we were hiding something from her,"" Sarojamma, a neighbour said.Harsha's body was kept under a pandal put up in front of their home. His elder sister, a II PU student, sat in a corner, too shocked and shattered by the turn of events, tears rolling down her cheeks.Hundreds of mourners took part in Harsha's last journey to the burial ground at Surabh Layout , one km away. He was laid to rest around 3.30pm.TIMES VIEWYoung Harsha's life, tragically cut short due to a small misunderstanding and rivalry, should set off alarm bells among parents, teachers and peers, on the violence lurking in young minds. Why and how matters reached this pass with Harsha's friends may probably never be known, but it does hold a message for society at large. Teenagers, who may be influenced by films and other media, need to be monitored subtly both at home and school. Any aberration in their behaviour needs close examination and some quick counselling on the futility of violence."

They are, in fact, a vital part of Goanness, Goemkarponn and, most importantly, Goan cuisine. The coconut, be it freshly grated or dessicated or in its milk form, is a vital ingredient of numerous Goan dishes, both traditional and modern, as is the coconut toddy and the feni. Another important ingredient, especially to Goan Catholic cuisine is the coconut jaggery.Made from the sap of the coconut palm, this jaggery, also called madachem godd locally, is easily identified from its shape and colour. Ladies selling basketsful of the pyramid shaped (which is what it derives yet another name, pyramid jaggery) deep brown, verging on black jaggery are a common sight in every market. The pyramids are usually available in two size, the regular large size and a smaller size.Coconut jaggery is an essential ingredient for most Goan Catholic sweets such as dodol, pinagr, patoleo and alle-belle. Food blogger Sapna Sardessai says that though this jaggery, like the toddy vinegar, is not used in typical Hindu preparations, she, herself, likes it and uses it in preparations like patoleao and coconut-filled neuro. Coconut jaggery is definitely tastier than the sugarcane one that is used abundantly is Hindu cuisine, she says.While its use in sweet dishes is well-known and documented, this jaggery does not find much favour in savoury cooking. When asked about this, food researcher and writer Maria Lourdes Bravo da Costa cites just one savoury dish in which the coconut jaggery is used, the samarachi koddi. This curry is a blend of coconut milk, chillies and numerous spices. Aside from enhancing the taste, the addition of coconut jaggery helps balance the spice level of the curry, she says.On the nutrient front, coconut jaggery boasts of numerous health benefits. Being a rich source of magnesium and iron, and high in anti-oxidant properties, makes this jaggery a more nutritious alternative to the sugarcane jaggery and a healthier option as compared to refined white sugar, says nutritionist and dietician Nina Figuiredo . Apart from the array of traditional Goan sweets, can this jaggery be used as a sweetening agent for beverages like tea and coffee? Most definitely, Figuiredo says, though cautioning about the aftertaste. Since we are accustomed to using sugar to sweeten our tea or coffee, initially one may find that jaggery-sweetened tea or coffee has a strange aftertaste. But once the habit forms, this will not be an issue. Diabetes patients too can consume this jaggery, provided they do so in a small, regulated quanity, she says."

After meeting energy minister D K Shivkumar, Hukkeri said he had no intention of leaving the Congress, but cadre say he has sent out a message  that the neglect of senior leaders will not be tolerated.Political observers say Hukkeri's statement reflects the ""suffocating environment in the Congress party"" and a feeling of being side-lined by newer leaders.Hukkeri began his career as a gram panchayat member, and has been an MLC and a five-time MLA. He is now MP for Chikodi. Hukkeri was chief whip in the S M Krishna government. He was a minister in Dharam Singh's government and was the district in-charge.After Siddaramaiah became chief minister, Hukkeri has lost a little ground. Despite being the senior partyman, it was Satish Jarkiholi, who is close to Siddaramaiah, and not him who was made district in-charge. Hukkeri was put in charge of Haveri district.At first, he was assigned the relatively unimportant muzrai ministry and rebelled. Then, the sugar and small scale industries ministries were given to him.Experts say Congress will have to do a lot of hard work before the elections to unite its factions as well as broker peace between the old and new leaders withing the party."

Perched on the edge of Maharashtra and bordering Karnataka, rumours of sex-selective abortions at the hospital had brought it under the lens of the authorities.

Twenty-six-year-old Swati Jamdade had died on March 1, following a botched-up abortion on the hospitals premises. This time, the doctors arrived with a police team in tow. To their horror, they discovered a full-fledged operation theatre in the basement being run by the homeopath, who was not eligible to conduct surgical procedures. The white-tiled basement also had two clean rooms, with beds. Dr. Khidrapure was nowhere to be seen. He had fled before the raid. A computer table in the corner was stacked with registers. While many things appeared displaced and missing to the raiding officers, they seized everything they could lay their hands on, and questioned locals.A routine line of questioning led the investigating team to Ravi Sutar, the local milkman who was also tasked with disposing biomedical waste from the hospital. Sutar pointed to an area barely 150 m away. On March 5, the police unearthed what Dr. Khidrapure had been burying  19 foetuses were exhumed, bundled in blue plastic bags and buried in a mud pit. Some in advanced stages of decomposition, others freshly buried, these were the aborted foetuses over the past two months, concluded the police. The foetuses have been sent for DNA testing.If Dr. Khidrapure had carried out 19 illegal abortions in two months, how many unborn babies had the doctor killed in his practice over the last eight years, the police now wonder.A botched-up abortionSwati, from Manerajuri village, 40 km away from Mhaisal, was a mother of two  four-year-old Swaranjali and one-and-a-half-year-old Pranjali  and was pregnant with her third child. Her husband Pravin, a farmer, wanted a boy and was desperate to know the sex of the unborn child.  Chachni karun ghe (Get the test done), a friend suggested to Pravin and referred him to Dr. Khidrapures hospital. On February 28, Pravin landed at the Bharti Hospital with his wife, then in her fifth month of pregnancy. After a brief meeting with Dr. Khidrapure, the couple was referred to Dr. Srihari Ghodkes clinic in the bordering Kagwad village in Karnataka, six km away from Mhaisal, where a sonography was conducted. With the Maharashtra government keeping an eagle eye on hospitals, sex determination was a strict no-no. But in bordering Karnataka, rules were lax. There was no paperwork involved. Dr. Khidrapure informed Pravin that it was a girl and he promptly offered to abort the foetus.Despite his wifes pleadings, Pravin admitted her to the Bharti Hospital on March 1. He called his father-in-law Sunil Jhadhav, who lives in Puducherry, to inform that he was going ahead with the abortion. I dissuaded him from going ahead with the procedure and asked him to consult a doctor, Jhadhav told The Hindu . But by then, Dr. Khidrapure had already induced labour by placing abortion pills Misoprostol in the patient.In a span of four hours, Misoprostol induces cramps and bleeding through which a woman aborts. Doctors also carry out a vacuum aspiration to remove the contents of the uterus. But before Dr. Khidrapure could carry out the procedure, Swati became breathless and her condition deteriorated. Ill-equipped to handle an emergency, Dr. Khidrapure asked Pravin to rush his wife to the Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital in Miraj, 20 km away from Mhaisal. Swati succumbed on her way to the hospital. Her family subsequently forced Pravin to take the body to the Sangli Civil Hospital. As the patient was brought dead, the doctors informed the Miraj police as per protocol. The police, in turn, quizzed Pravin, who blurted out that his wife had died during an abortion.But when the police stumbled on the foetuses, what emerged was a multi-State racket that Dr. Khidrapure was running. To date, the police have arrested 12 people including Dr. Khidrapure, two doctors from Karnataka who conducted the sex determination tests, and four agents  Saatgonda Patil and Veerangonda Gumte from Belgaum and Yasin Tehsildar and Sandip Jadhav from Kolhapur  who preyed on couples desperate for a male child and eager to abort the female foetuses.While authorities were sleepingDr. Khidrapure grew up in Kanwad village that falls under Kolhapur district. After completing his studies in homeopathy in Belgaum, he opened a small dispensary in Mhaisal where he prescribed medicines for minor ailments like fever, pain and dog bites. It was sometime in 2008 that he bought a piece of land on which he built the Bharti Hospital and began offering hysterectomy and appendectomy surgeries by inviting doctors from Sangli, most of whom were retired practitioners from the Sangli Civil Hospital, to operate on patients. The police are questioning the doctors who worked here.The district health officials were well aware about all the illegalities from the very beginning. But they simply turned a blind eye, alleges Ashok Wadar, an activist from Mhaisal who had written the anonymous letter to the Collector in 2016 following which the medical officers were sent for an inspection. He also claims to have made 30 calls on the governments toll-free number meant for whistle-blowers who want to highlight Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act violations. But no one paid heed to my complaints, he says, adding that Dr. Khidrapure had top connections due to which no one dared to take him on.Incidentally, the PHC that stands within a km from Dr. Khidrapures hospital is administered by a District Health Officer (DHO) who also has the responsibility of keeping tabs on private nursing homes in the area. I never received any complaints about the hospital, says Dr. Ram Hankare, DHO since the past three years. The doctor was probably conducting illegal abortions during night and it is the civil surgeons job to keep a watch, Dr. Hankare told The Hindu . When questioned, the civil surgeon, Dr. Sanjay Salunkhe, tossed it right back at the DHO: It is the DHOs responsibility to keep a watch on the medical establishments in his area.Of the 25 private nursing homes in Mhaisal, only one has the licence to run an In-Patient Department (IPD) and can admit patients. Bharti Hospital does not feature on this list but Dr. Khidrapure still admitted patients.During the March 3 raid on Bharti Hospital, the police found, besides the basement operation theatre and two rooms, surgical equipment such as abdominal retractors, curved artery forceps, Sims speculum, dilator, allis tissue forceps and spiral needles; oxygen cylinders; an X-ray machine; huge quantities of abortion pills; and other medications that were charred. A large pipe connects the basement to the drainage system outside and the police suspect that some of the aborted foetuses would have been discarded through it. The police have learnt that most of the abortions were carried out using Misoprostol; the hospital was buying the drug in bulk from a Sangli-based distributor, Sunil Khedkar. However, the absence of a sonography machine used to determine the sex of the foetus puzzled the police. The search took the police across the border into Karnataka.The multi-State racketDuring the search at Bharti Hospital, the Miraj Rural police stumbled upon names of some doctors in the registers. A raid conducted in Dr. Srihari Ghodkes clinic in Kagwad, Karnataka yielded two sonography machines. The clinic functioned mostly at night. The patients were sent for sonography tests to Kagwad and the abortion would be conducted in Mhaisal, says Dattatray Shinde, Superintendent of Police, Sangli.Run from a two-storey bungalow, the clinic stands barely 100 m from the Kagwad police station and another 200 m from the government-run Community Health Centre. Dr. Ghodke, 68, who has been arrested, is said to have been running the clinic for over two decades. It was a maternity home at first that abruptly shut down. Later on, we could only see some action after 11 p.m. There would be couples going in and out of the bungalow, says a local, adding that everyone in the area knew that something illegal was happening. But the police chose to turn a blind eye. Why should we visit any clinics? We only investigate cases that come to us, says Laxman Ajjanagi, head constable at the Kagwad police station. Kagwad falls under the Belgaum district that has 242 registered PCPNDT centres and over 2,400 medical centres.Meanwhile, the Miraj police have arrested another doctor, Ramesh Devgikar, 64, from Bijapur in Karnataka who has a Diploma in Medical Radio Diagnosis and is suspected to have sent several patients for abortion to Dr. Khidrapures hospital. The police have seized two sonography machines from him as well. The Devgikar X-ray and Sonography Centre is among the dozen-odd small and large hospitals, nursing homes and radiology centres strewn across a 300-metre radius in the busy, narrow lane in Meenakshi Chowk. A retired doctor from the government-run district hospital in Bijapur, Devgikar set up his private centre 15 years ago. His tryst with the law dates back to 2015 when he was first booked under the PCPNDT Act by health officials who also seized his sonography machine. While the machine was later returned, the case is still pending in court. Neighbours say Devgikar had the busiest practice in the area. On average, he conducted more than 50 obstetric sonographies in a day. Police are still investigating into how many of these were for sex determination.Health workers from Bijapur say that sex-selective abortions are extremely common in the area. We come across many women who have one or two daughters and tell us that they dont want another girl. Suddenly during a medical check-up, we learn that these women have had a miscarriage or a stillbirth, says a health worker, adding that the government has made it mandatory for them to maintain tayee or mother cards on which details of pregnant women and their existing children are mentioned. According to her, a health worker keeps track of 20-22 pregnant women annually, of which at least 3-4 undergo abortions.Sources from Bijapur say most clients coming to Devgikar were from Sangli and Miraj. The doctors are closely connected with the agents who operate from border districts of Karnataka such as Belagavi. Some of the agents have their own vehicles which they use to carry the pregnant women to Bijapur from Maharashtra for sonographies, says a source, adding that the gender is disclosed in a very methodical way. All the doctors have their unique code words. The disclosure is done to the agent always. One of the most popular codes is pointing at the ear when its a girl, as girls wear earrings. If they touch the nose, it means a boy.A massive crackdown on sonography centres had begun in 2011 in Maharashtra, and health officials and the police suspect this is what prompted Dr. Khidrapure to explore options across the border. According to Deputy Superintendent of Police (Miraj division) Dheeraj Patil, Dr. Khidrapure charged anywhere between Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 25,000 per abortion while the doctors conducting the sex determination tests would charge Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 10,000 per test depending on the profile of the patients and the agents would make Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000 per couple.Oh, for a boy!At the core of these abortions is the deep-rooted desire in society to have a boy, an heir to the family. Everyone wants one boy at least. What is there to understand in this? says Namdeo Suryavanshi, a Mhaisal farmer who has two daughters aged four and two and whose wife Meenakshi is expecting a third baby soon. It is not that I am not going to look after my daughters. They are also important. But a son will complete our family, says Suryavanshi, who works in a sugar-cane farm. When asked if he went for any sex determination tests, Suryavanshi promptly says, I have got all my wifes tests done at the Miraj Civil Hospital.Shafiabi Inamdar, 62, from the neighbouring Kanwad village has seven daughters. Today if I had a boy, he would have been there to look after me and take care of this house, she says. The mothers are helpless. There is tremendous pressure on them to have a boy. The in-laws and the husbands are brutal when it comes to having a girl child back-to-back, says Rajashri Zare, an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) from the village. Everyone just wants vanshacha diva (lineage flame).All I ever wanted was for my son-in-law to keep my daughter happy, says Swatis father Sunil Jhadhav. We had shelled out Rs. 3 lakh in cash, 150 grams of gold and an entire sansar set that consists of all household things like television, refrigerator, dining table, sofa set, utensils, bed etc.Clearly, that was not enough.with Firoz Rozindar in BijapurThe district health officials were well aware about all the illegalities from the very beginning.

In Dehradun last week, I found myself in the midst of an argument between two genial old men on who made the better gujiyas. I couldnt be a judge because while one lot of gujiyas was there in a box waiting to be eaten, the other lot was still being prepared by an army of men and women. But the ones that were there were indeed delicious. The pastry was fluffy, crisp and light in colour, and the stuffing was delightful. Since I was a guest there, I limited myself to two gujiyas, and looked sadly at the ones that were left in the box.That is why, after I returned to Delhi a few days later, I went to the Walled City to pick up some sweets. And while I had gujiyas in mind, I got distracted when I found myself in a narrow lane in Chandni Chowk  and suddenly remembered an old shop that I used to haunt once.The name of the shop is Hem Chand Ladli Prashad Milk Seller, and the address is 336, Kucha Ghasi Ram (Phone nos: 9891183455 and 56). The shop is on the Fatehpuri Mosque side of Chandni Chowk, close to Brijwasi Bhojanalaya. You enter the galli and turn left when it takes a sudden sharp turn. On the right is the sweet shop.When I used to go there long years ago, I always had  over a sweet or two  a pleasant chat with the owner, Gopi Kishan Gupta, whose father had started the business some 80 years ago. Gopiji is no more; the shop is now managed by his son, Anup Gupta.It is a small place which doesnt look much like a sweet shop because there is nothing on display. But if you know the shop, you will know that its milk cake is among the best in town. They just sell two kinds of sweets  burfis and milk cakes. However, if you place an order in advance, they will make rabri and khurchan for you  two other kinds of sweet that I am greatly fond of. Once I was there, I forgot all about gujiyas and asked for some milk cake (Rs. 500 a kilo) and burfi (Rs. 440) to be packed.I think what makes their sweet so special is the milk that they use for their products. The Guptas are very careful about the quality of the milk, and that shows in the sweets.Take the milk cake. It had just come off the stove in a steel container when I was there, so it was deliciously warm and moist. They thicken the milk for long hours, which is why the sweet is alluringly brown in colour. It is grainy, has just the right amount of sugar in it, and is not hard as milk cake can be. Likewise, the burfi is superb. It is not dense, as some burfis are, but light in taste and texture. I had a piece there and decided that I had to take some for family and friends.The sweets were devoured in no time at home. And no one said a word about the missing gujiyas."

The survey, released on Friday, estimates the real Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) at Rs. 18,15,498 crore.For the second consecutive fiscal year, agriculture and allied activities have registered a negative growth rate: (-)4.6% for 2015-16 and (-)11.2% in 2014-15. Thanks to a poor monsoon, production of major crops decreased substantially during 2015-16, while that of foodgrain declined by nearly 27% over the previous year.Oilseed production dropped by nearly 9.1%, and sugarcane, fruits and vegetables too registered a decrease in production by 21.1% and 3.4% respectively. Only cotton registered a 10.8% growth. The survey, however, estimates double-digit growth for the sector at 12.5% for 2016-17, as the State benefited from a good monsoon in the current fiscal year.Growth in industry sub-sectors like mining, manufacturing and construction is expected to slow down.The per capita Net State Income (Per Capita NSDP) at current prices is estimated at Rs. 1,47,399 crore for 2015-16; the same was Rs. 1,32,341 during 2014-15. With revenue expenditure expected to be Rs. 2,24,455 crore as per the 2016-17 budget estimate and revenue receipts at Rs. 2,20,810 crore, the States revenue deficit stands at Rs. 3,645 crore, while fiscal deficit is estimated at around Rs. 35,031 crore. The States debt stock is estimated to have gone up to Rs. 3,56,213 crore from the revised estimate of Rs. 3,20,210 crore for 2015-16.In all this, there is some solace, with the survey stating that as per 2016-17 budget estimates, the percentage of fiscal deficit and debt stock to GSDP is well within the fiscal limits stipulated by the 14th Finance Commission under Consolidated Fiscal Reform Path.Of the total revenue expenditure of Rs. 2,24,455 crore, 35.6% is being spent on salary and wages, 10% on pensions, 40.9% on maintenance, purchase of goods and services and 12.6% on interests on loans.When we took charge, the State economys growth rate was 5.4%, which we have taken to 9.4%.

Last week, Coca-Cola India president Venkatesh Kini had suggested a sugar tax on all products  not just beverages  that use the sweetener.The maker of Coca-Cola and Sprite fizzy drinks and Minute Maid juices is pushing for a post-GST taxation policy that would treat all companies fairly based on the content of the product. India is the beverage maker's sixth biggest market globally.The Indian arm of the US company has sought that the average tax rate of 34% to be retained on aerated drinks after the GST is introduced, likely, on July 1. The GST Council recently said it will levy a cess of 15% on this particular category on top of a peak rate of 28%.This makes the total tax rate on carbonated drinks at 43%. Coca-Cola has proposed a 6% cess over peak rate. ""We hope and expect that all products that contain sugar will be taxed according to their content across categories, and that beverages are not singled out. We are hopeful GST will be levied on the basis of sugar content, not on the basis of carbonation,"" Kini had told ET in an interview last week.Coca-Cola has also said in the recent past that it wants the roll out of the GST to be postponed by a couple of months.""A higher tax at this juncture, when aerated drinks makers are facing slowing growth, will significantly impact the category's revival. It will lead to higher consumer prices when the concerned companies are pushing volumes and launching smaller packs,"" a top bottling official said.Aerated drinks companies are pushing for a differentiated tax structure based on sugar content instead of carbonation. ""The category is neither a luxury nor a sin product. So the higher taxation is not justified,"" the bottling official quoted earlier said.India is considered a critical and high-potential country for Coa-Cola, given its low penetration of packaged soft drinks. The company has been attempting to re-invent its portfolio to include teas, flavoured waters, and dairy to respond to changing urban consumer preferences for low sugar drinks."

I have spoken to others and the story is same everywhere.""The biggest markets of tilkut are in Upper Bazaar and Ratu Road and the smaller ones are at Birsa Chowk and Doranda. The sweet shops in these markets make the tilkut and then package it for distribution in shops across the city.The primary ingredient of the sweet is a specially prepared dough of either jaggery or sugar, which is then dipped in sesame seeds and then mixed well.""I buy at least 6 kg of tilkut every year.

These days everyone claims they are from Gaya so we have stopped writing anything on our boxes,"" said Rakesh Kumar, a shop-owner in Upper Bazaar.Apart from those sweet sellers who use the traditional tag of being from Gaya because of the brand equity, there are others who use modern-day sugar-free sweets to allure customers.However, not every old sweet seller can prepare the delicacies for health conscious customers. ""After hearing about sugar-free tilkut we tried making it but it is not possible. One kg of the cheapest artificial sweetener sells for Rs 3,000 which makes the rate at which sugar-free tilkut is sold very expensive.

And though as households, we spend only 3% of our monthly food budget on sugar, eventually we also pay for the more expensive sugar in ready-to-eat foods, ice creams, sweets, snacks, cold drinks, confectionery, and restaurant meals. The food and hospitality industry, which buys 65% of the country's sugar, passes on the price increases to us.Maharashtra, which contributes a third of India's total supply, is expected to produce 40% less sugar in 2016-17. In Karnataka, production is down 44% due to the drought. Together, that is loss of sugar enough for two months consumption.Due to the acute water scarcity, farmers in these two states did not plant new sugarcane crop in 2016-17. The ratoon crop also yielded less juice. At least 45 sugar factories in Maharashtra shut operations early because no cane is available. The rest will shut in the next one-and-a-half months. Since the slack in Maharashtra and Karnataka will not be compensated by the increased production in Uttar Pradesh, India may fall short of sugar to meet demand. By September end, when the 2016-17 sugar marketing closes, we are likely to be left with stocks enough for only 47 days. This will be the lowest in several years.In Uttar Pradesh, mills have produced 10% more sugar than last year and sales are brisk. As a result, farmers are being paid at least 75% of their bill within the 15-day deadline. The delayed payments are mainly by corporate groups with high debt and poor cash flows.While farmers and mills are coping well, consumers are less fortunate. The tight supplies have pushed up retail prices to above Rs 45kg in the metros just four months into the new sugar marketing year. Industrial consumers are also paying more in the wholesale markets. Sugar was 28% more expensive in December compared to the same month in 2015, shows latest Wholesale Price Index data.Luckily, ample sugar is available in Brazil, the world's largest producer and exporter. If customs duty is removed, raw sugar can reach India at Rs 40kg. That should provide much-needed relief to consumers.But the window of opportunity to import affordable sugar is small since global prices have risen 15% in the last one month and 41% in last 12 months.These tactical actions will not, however, address the stark reality that India will remain in this hand-to-mouth situation for several years ahead due to the combined challenges of rising consumption, water scarcity and climate change. Political intervention has further queered the pitch by distorting market signals that would have otherwise ensured more efficient water, land and capital utilization. And consumers aren't the only ones affected. Sugar industry is a key source of rural income and jobs.So making the industry more competitive overall is the only way to spread sweetness and light."

At the entrance, T S Babuji has set up a makeshift stall, complete with medical testing kits and a weighing machine. As people stream in, they pause, many opt to get their weight, blood pressure (BP) and blood sugar checked.""I was recently diagnosed with high BP and am on medication.Since I come every day to the park for a walk, it is easier to get my BP checked here; I can't go to a doctor all the time,"" says 53-yearold businessman S Ponnambalam.Public parks and beaches have become ideal spots for health marketing. While hospitals and healthcare centres offer attractive `packages', checking BP, blood sugar and weight, small vendors sell sprouts and fruits as well as soups and juices. And a few bigger brands try to market their energy drinks.While the test packages are attractive, some centres even home deliver medicines - a word of caution for the doctors. While opportunistic screening has its plus points, it also has room for error. And not every drink offers you a daily dose of health.At Natesan Park, Babuji, of Al-Shifa Healthcare Centre Madipakkam, is a regular from Monday to Friday for the last one year. ""I check BP, blood sugar and weight for Rs 30,"" says Babuji, who is present from 6am to 9:30am. ""Every day about 30 to 40 people opt for the package,"" he says.Dr M Savugar Sathik, who runs AlShifa, says his centre specialises in alternative medicine. ""We have been sending trained personnel to the park as many people come there to exercise,"" he says.Institutions such as M V Hospital for Diabetes and Dr Mohan's Diabetes Specialities Centre have been conducting free awareness programmes and health check ups at parks, beaches and other public spaces for years. ""It's usually people aged 40 and above, who frequent parks. Some of them may have diabetes or may be overweight and are advised to exercise by their physicians,"" says Dr Mohan, adding that they had been part of a project, PACE (prevention, awareness, counselling and evaluation), to raise awareness about diabetes. ""We had personnel going to almost all the parks, colleges, government offices, corporate places, and religious institutes,"" he says, adding that they continued the exercise after the project was over.Dr Vijay Viswanathan of MV Hospital for Diabetes says they have been sending educators and counsellors to certain city parks. ""People who have a family history of diabetes or are borderline diabetic come there to exercise,"" he says, adding that they are now doing a North Chennai Diabetes Control programme for WHO.While healthcare centres dole out tests and advice, small vendors selling healthy snacks and juices also do brisk business in these places. Sachidananda Panneerselvam and his friends gather around Abdul Rasheed's stall, and sip hot cups of soup and munch on sprouts. ""We do yoga here every day at 5:30am and then have something healthy to eat before heading home,"" he says.Rasheed sells paper cups filled with a variety of sprouts for Rs 10, platefuls of vegetable and fruit salad for Rs 20, and juices of neem, amla, gooseberry, and soups. ""I sell about 5 litres of soup every day and the business doubles on Sundays,"" he says.Companies have also been swift to spot the marketing opportunity. At Nageswara Rao Park in Mylapore, two young girls wander up to a group of men playing badminton. Assuring them that their ""energy drink"" is better than the morning cup of coffee, they pop open cans and hand them over to the bemused people. ""This drink will give you high energy for five hours,"" they say , omitting the fact that it is loaded with sugar and not the ideal thing to have on an empty stomach.""People marketing such drinks shouldn't be allowed to do it here or give out wrong messages,"" says Dr Viswanathan, adding that people should take proper advice from a dietician, cardiologist andor physician before launching on a new health regime.Dr Mohan points out random tests conducted on the field also leave room for error.""It is called opportunistic screening, which has its plus points, as you can test people on the spot. But it has its pitfalls too - it could be the wrong time of the day; it is random blood sugar level, and a person who has been on a jog can even show raised BP ,"" he says, adding that the tests on the field are not diagnostic tests. ""It is not done under laboratory conditions, so if you are told you have raised BP or blood sugar, you need to see a doctor and get a lab test done."""

Even as they have hunted down innumerable illicit liquor units which have sprung up in large numbers ahead of the polls, there is another menace that needs to be tackled - binge-drinking elephants. Officials fear that these sloshed jumbos might create considerable havoc in villages surrounding the forest areas and the Ganga. Herds of elephants from the Amangarh and Corbett Tiger Reserves are drawn by the strong smell of the locally-made brew. Once intoxicated, forest officials said chances of these beasts making merry at the expense of villagers run high.According to sources, these alcohol units are set up in the sugarcane fields near dense forests. Stockpiles of the hooch attract these beasts who go berserk, often damaging huts and rampaging fields of the villagers. Forest officials said raids in the areas are a must to keep the jumbos at bay.According to data provided by the excise department, 202 cases were registered against liquor mafias in December last year, out of which 41 accused were sent to jail. Police and the excise department recovered 2,586 litres of liquor from their possession.District excise officer Janardan Yadav said, ""We have formed three teams led by different inspectors to raid suspected areas. Large amounts of hooch have already been recovered so far. We have been keeping a strict vigil."" Amangarh Tiger Reserve (ATR), home to around 35 elephants, is connected to the Corbett Tiger Reserve. Many a times, elephants from Corbett wander towards ATR. With several sugarcane fields and illicit liquor units surrounding ATR, jumbos steer towards human habitation.Divisional forest officer, M Semmaran said, ""Elephants can smell liquor from a distance of two kilometres. They usually go on a rampage after consuming alcohol. Although we have not received any reports of damage yet, all forest officials have been instructed to keep a vigil on the areas. A meeting was recently held in Afjalgarh to appeal to all villagers not to engage in illicit-liquor manufacture."" Assistant superintendent of police (ASP) MM Beg said, ""We have launched a special drive after the model code of conduct was enforced in the state. Police have been on its toes to keep stop these manufacturing units."""

The logic: Taking catering trays, say on a Delhi-Kochi-Delhi flight, for the return flight from Delhi adds to the weight of the plane on the Delhi-Kochi sector and increases fuel burn.""It is not just about savings. When we uplift food from other destinations, our passengers will get to savour the local flavours. We are now uplifting catering from Kochi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru. We will do so in whichever city we can uplift catering from without compromising on our high standards of passenger service,"" Vistara CEO Phee Teik Yeoh told TOI, just ahead of the airline turning two.Vistara, which is yet to break even, is looking at several areas of cost reduction and revenue augmentation. However, Phee Teik emphasies all this will be done without compromising the onboard passenger service which the airline prides itself on.""We are open to course correction and did that in the first year itself by deciding to alter the number of seats in business, premium economy and economy cabins of our planes. In many of our cities we fly to, the check-in process was outsourced. Now to reduce expense on that front, we have made that an in-house function in seven of the 18 cities we currently fly to,"" he said.""We have re-negotiated many of our contracts with suppliers. On catering too, we are doing direct procurement of certain items. We are doing competitive bidding for certain things which will be on board, like say sugar sachets,"" Phee Teik said.The airline has started offering the services of its security personnel at airports, who are posted at various places like check-in counters and at aircraft entry gates, to international airlines. As a revenue augmentation move, it now allows economy class passengers to use its airport lounges by paying Rs 1,000 at the check-in counter. It is increasing the options for generating ancillary revenue from passengers.The CEO favors the complete abolition of any preconditions for Indian carriers to fly abroad including the diluted 0/20 which requires a carrier to have at least 20 planes in its fleet to go overseas. ""For now we accept 0/20 but even this should go eventually for the good of Indian aviation. We are not saying this for our benefit but for aviation in the country. Any airline that is perfectly safe to fly and operationally efficient should be allowed to go abroad without any restrictions,"" he said.While Vistara is scheduled to get its 20th plane in June, 2018, the airline may pre-pone the delivery to become eligible to fly abroad earlier. The CEO, however, did not give any time frame when Vistara will start overseas flights. ""We are working out the long term plan. Going overseas will require fund infusion. All these things are being worked out and we will launch foreign operations as soon as we are prepared,"" he said."

This time, he has been booked for cheating and forgery in a property dispute case.The complainant, Pramodkumar Rahlan, who has named Gawde and 13 persons of the Dibrit family, said his father Rajkumar had purchased a 2,650-sqm property in Nalasopara (E) in 1987 from the Dibrits. The barren land had a temple on it, he said. Rajkumar passed away in 2005. ""In 2013, we learnt that the Dibrits had added the names of three heirs and had given the plot to Rex Rodrigues, Gawde and Kalpesh Rodrigues by forging documents,"" said Rahlan, who filed a suit in the Vasai court.Gawde claimed the plot was purchased on March 22, 2013, using genuine documents. He added that after Rahlan filed a complaint with the Thane crime branch in 2014, he had submitted all documents pertaining to the land deal to the officials.The corporator said that on January 1, the additional collector at Jawhar had ruled in his favour.He added that a false cheating case was filed against him at Tuling police station and the matter is pending in the Vasai court.The Tuling police has charged Gawde (43) under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 466 (forgery of record of court), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 167 (public servant framing incorrect document) based on the complaint.Gawde, a businessman, is House leader of the Sena in Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation. The municipality is ruled by the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi party of MLA Hitendra Thakur.Earlier, in December, Gawde, who is also deputy chief of the Shiv Sena's Thane district unit, was detained by the crime branch and Thane income-tax officials while carrying Rs 1.1 crore cashRs 47 lakh in new notes and the rest in old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notesin the boot of his car, following a specific tip-off. Gawde claimed the money belonged to hotelier Sudharshan Sheregar with whom he was travelling. He was let off after a 12-hour-long interrogation even as raids were carried out at his residence in Thane.The next day, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray sought to downplay Gawde's detention by pointing out a similar case involving BJP minister Subhash Deshmukh on November 17, 2016, when Rs 91.5 lakh was found in a vehicle in Umergaon in Osmanabad district. The car reportedly belonged to Deshmukh, who claimed that the cash was meant for payment to the labourers of a sugar cooperative factory, which is affiliated to the Lok Mangal group."

Tiwari who had been raising the issues of farmers' suicide from Yavatmal since two years heads the Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM) working on farmers' welfare. Lately, SBI chief Arundhati Bhattacharya had expressed her views discouraging waiver.Tiwari said out of Rs30,500 crore of the defaulted loans to be waived, nearly Rs22000 crore are from the flourishing pockets. These are in regions like Western Maharashtra , such as the grape belt of Nashik and the sugar cane growing areas, where there is assured irrigation. There are some pockets in east Vidarbha too, he said.Barely one-fourth of the amount will go to the farmers in the distressed districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada , where there is a real crisis. This is because the scale of finance for the crops like cotton and soybean grown in these areas is meagre to take the loan size bigger, he said ""Rather steps should be taken to increase the bank credit coverage and increase the income of farmers in such regions,"" said Tiwari.However, Tiwari agreed that the number of farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada is half of the 4 million in the state who may have benefited if the waiver was approved.The farmers who account for majority of the amount of loan to be waived are engaged in growing, cash crops like grapes, sugar cane, floriculture apart from having, allied activities like dairy farming, he said.The number of defaults has gone up even in the flourishing areas too since the mega farm waiver of Rs70,000 crore during the UPA Government. This means it cannot be ruled out that income from farming needs to be increased, said Tiwari.In areas like Vidarbha where it is largely dryland farming, hardly 30% of the farmers are covered under bank finance. This means the scope of lending needs to be widened. Unless the number of farmers in such areas are covered under bank finance, waivers would end up in only a gimmick.Tiwari said this year there are plans to coordinate with banks to start farm lending from April and finish it by mid May. At the same time, a plan needs to be drafted that farmers in the dryland areas should get credit for at lest five years in a row despite any eventualities. Unless the farmers' income is not increased the repaying capacity cannot be built, he saidThe state government had declined the proposal to waive farm loans on the grounds that the funds can be utilized for other sectors of the society."

It predicts a revenue deficit of 2.41% and a fiscal deficit of 3.44%. These are within the expected range and doesn't signal any fiscal danger in the near future.When we go into the details of the budget, we can see that KIIFB is a dream which has to become a reality. Last year, in the budget, KIIFB was projected as a special purpose vehicle. It is an SPV that is expected to mobilize resources through funding from NRIs by forming chit funds of KSFE.Through this chit funds, the finance minister wants to mobilize Rs 12,000 crore this year for various projects and ensure Rs 50,000 crore over the next five years for several infrastructural projects. The aim is to ensure a world class infrastructure sector here.But, what about the 'crushing problem' faced by the people of Kerala? The LDF had promised in its manifesto that they will arrest price hike for five years.Unfortunately, LDF failed to keep its promise.The government was unable to check the price of essential commodities, especially rice and sugar. While the retail price index in India is 3.67%, it is much above the national average in Kerala.This is against the expectations given in the budget and the LDF manifesto. LDF is trying to strengthen food security by allocating Rs 900 crore for ration subsidy and Rs 700 crore for paddy procurement. Additionally, Rs 117 crore has been sanctioned for the new rationing system.A total of Rs 1,917 crore has been set apart for food security and Haritha Keralam Mission has also been given top priority. But, we will have to wait and see whether this mission mode will resolve the price rise of essential commodities.Though Thomas Isaac has announced a gender budget, the priority given is not sufficient. He has mentioned that 11.5% of the budget allocation is for projects from which women will benefit. But this allocation is spread across various lines of expenditure and the fructification of anyone will be very minimal. If gender has to get equity and equality, there should be more capital investment. It is seen that more capital is invested in the field of health education for boys than the girls.If you take the enrolment rate of girls in professional courses, you can see that only 30% of the girls are getting admitted. At the same time, in arts and science colleges 70% of the seats are occupied by girls. This shows that there is a gender disparity in the capital infusion in the field of health and education.The work force participation rate for women and men are 17.1% and 57.1% respectively. Even though there is no disparity in the literary standards of men and women, there is a gender disparity in the work participation force. This has to be rectified and only then women empowerment and gender budgeting will have any meaning."

The boys were detained soon after Pintu's family members expressed suspicion about their involvement in the murder. However, the police were not sure since deceased Pintu was of their age. Meanwhile, the police explored other possibilities but did not find any strong lead.On Sunday, the family members again objected to carrying out postmortem on Pintu's body. The postmortem could not be conducted on Saturday too due to their objection. There was a crowd of around 500 people at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER). However, senior police officials were able to convince them after accepting some of their demands.The boys informed the police that they went to eat sugarcane in a nearby farm on Thursday evening. They fought there over some issue when both the accused slapped and punched the deceased. Pintu fainted due to the thrashing after which the accused lifted him and left in the bushes.""The boys were afraid that they will be punished by their schoolteacher or their parents if Pintu complained to them about the thrashing on regaining consciousness.

The police investigation revealed that the teenager was murdered within half an hour of the trio going to the field together.Investigation revealed that Pintu had fought with the accused many times in the past, including over their friendship with a girl. Police initially suspected that they had fought over the issue of girl but ruled it out after a detailed investigation.Those who knew Pintu told the police that the three were best of friends and used to roam around together and fought too often. They recently fought after a teacher scolded them for some mischief and Pintu held the two responsible for it later."

Over 60% of the mothers who claimed their children were normal were wrong as their kids were malnourished.Economist and Nobel Prize winner Angus Deaton has pointed to poor sanitation and infections as eroding nutrition levels in India.Besides, the children's diet lacks protein and fat. Malnutrition leaves them vulnerable to disease and early death. According to NFHS data, 41 babies from every lakh die in the state and 51 do not survive beyond the age of five.The EPW paper, based on research done in the southern districts of Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banwara and Rajsamand , with a high tribal population prone to out-migration, showed that about 20% of the mothers from nearly 500 households surveyed reported the loss of a child.The authors found that ""only about 28% of the children consumed milk. Almost none of them had consumed egg, meat or fish over the last 24 hours. Fewer than 10% reported consuming appropriate and nutritional food items such as 'daliya' (porridge), rice, pulses and vegetables or fruits, and even those had it in small quantities. A significant proportion of children were given tea, biscuits and and 'namkeen' (fried snacks)"". One mother reported that she only bought milk when the child fell sick. ""Otherwise, we cannot afford milk.""Fifty-eight per cent of the mothers studied by the EPW authors were malnourished as well, struggling to cope with the heavy demands of motherhood and housework.Trupti Rane of CRY said, ""Malnourishment in early years is directly linked to maternal health. Poorly nourished, expecting and lactating mothers pass on their deficiencies to the child. Having newborns breastfed within the first hour of birth is critical for baby nutrition. Colostrum (the first milk of the mother), extremely rich in nutrients and antibodies, ensures basic nutrition and immunization. Universalization of anganwadi centres and robust growth monitoring measures can lead to a lasting solution of this issue.""The article also pointed to the failure of government provisioning - only a fourth of the people studied sought healthcare from a public facility.""Nutritional support offered by PDS remains low, both due to poor functioning and the scheme being limited to grains and sugar (with no pulses or oil),"" the authors note. Only 3.6% of women reported working under the MGNREGA scheme.Chhaya Pachauli of NGO Prayas said, ""Both public health and ICDS infrastructure are in awful shape. Outreach services and counselling which could go a long way in preventing malnutrition are hardly prioritized. Government may introduce endless schemes, but until there's a boost in budget for health and nutrition, not much improvement can be expected. Efforts to strengthen health, nutrition, sanitation and PDS need to go hand in hand."""

As the administration is turning a blind eye, sugar cane juice sellers on the road leading to Mahal from T-point of Octroi Naka 13 have turned encroachers, posing a traffic hazard to commuters,"" said motorists.In the first half of the day, the sugar cane juice sellers are lined up on the road leading to Mahal. However, they gradually encroach more than half of the road in the afternoon, leaving almost four to five feet of road for motorists to use.The problem aggravates on Saturdays when second hand market encroaches the entire 200-metre patch in front of Empress Mall. Second hand clothes market in front of east railway station gate further adds to the woes.""The vendors block a major part of the road and traffic moves at a snail's pace. No amount of pleading or blaring horns can move them,"" said Akash Deshpande, a resident of Mahal.

In an effort to curb the growing incidence of lifestyle diseases like diabetes and obesity , the government is mulling an additional fat tax on sugary beverages and packaged food high on salt and saturated fats.T he proposal was made by the group of secretaries on health, sanitation and urban development in a recent meeting with PM Narendra Modi to discuss budget proposals, an official said. The 11-member group has also suggested that proceeds from such higher taxes be used to increase the government's spending on health.""I n our presentation to the PM, we suggested higher taxes on junk food and sugary beverages because consumption of such products is growing fast and fuelling several lifestyle diseases like obesity, diabetes and heart disorders. We have also suggested that revenue earned from such tax be invested in health schemes,"" said a member of the gro up.T he proposal for higher taxes on such products has been in the pipeline since April last year. The government had also constituted an inter-ministerial committee headed by the health secretary to deliberate on the proposal to impose stringent measures including higher taxes and restrictions on endorsements and advertisements of such products on TV, mainly during prime time . ""The FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) is already working on mechanisms to regulate consumption of junk food. This is crucial given the growing disease burden in India,"" health secretary C K Mishra said, adding the ministry was in support of the proposal made by the group of secretaries.O f late, FSSAI has issued several guidelines to regulate junk food, including those on sale of such food in schools, and packaging norms. India's diabetes burden and the obesity problem have assumed serious levels. Experts blame these on the consumption of sugary beverages and junk food. Every year, nearly 5.8 million Indians die of heart and lung diseases, cancer and diabetes. In 2015, 69.1 million cases of diabetes were diagnosed in India.Th e disease burden is also fast increasing among children. Globally, the trend is high among children under five years of age with at least 41 million found to be obese or overweight in 2014. While the prevalence rate of obesity in this age group is still low in India at less than 5%, the WHO suggests it is rising at the fastest pace among all developing countries. Between 1990 and 2014, the number of overweight children in low and middle-income countries more than doubled from 7.5 million to 15.5 million. In 2014, almost half (48%) of all overweight and obese children under 5 years lived in Asia and a quarter (25%) in Afric a.""High consumption of sugary beverages contributes to multiple metabolic disorders due to accrual of body fat, as well as directly through excess nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), which impair critical functioning of the liver, pancreas and cellular functions,"" said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis CDOC Centre of Diabetes. The government's move is in line with the WHO which has been urging its member countries to regulate eating habits."

A division bench presided over by Justice Abhay Oka asked Hazare to first approach the police for a probe into the transactions and come to the court only if there was no response. Pawar was in the process of filing a defamation suit against Hazare, since the PILs were filed just a month ago before the civic and zilla parishad elections.Kelkar too was taken to task by the court over a PIL filed by him demanding a probe against 346 engineering colleges for submitting bogus documents to All India Council of Technical Education. The court said Kelkar should have first approached the police. The court also pointed out that as Kelkar was an elected representative, he should have raised the issue on the floor of the house for a probe against the erring colleges.A Mahalaxmi Saras exhibition, organized by the rural development department for promotion and sale of rural arts and crafts, recorded many cashless transactions. Rural development secretary Aseem Gupta and senior bureaucrats Kishore Raje Nimbalkar and R Vimala roped in a nationalised bank and swipe machines were provided to most of the 511 stalls free of cost along with brief training on the operation of the machine. Since it was not possible to provide bank accounts to all individual stall owners within a short span, it was proposed that money from all sales would be deposited in a single account and payments will be later distributed to them on the basis of transaction records. Authorities are hoping at least 50% of total transactions will be cashless.Partner in crimeMore than two decades ago, BJP leader Gopinath Munde had caused a stir when he disclosed that a close aide of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim had travelled in a private plane of a leading politician.The BJP made the politician-criminal nexus a poll plank in the 1995 assembly elections. Munde made several disclosures, resulting in a huge embarrassment to the Congress. Now decades later, BJP is facing a similar situation during elections to municipal corporations and zilla parishads owing to the entry of hardened criminals into the party. In the recent past, many individuals facing criminal charges have joined the party in the presence of cabinet members. A few days ago, an accused under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, joined BJP in the presence of food and civil supplies minister Girish Bapat.

Different ministries along with the Prime Minister's Office were made answerable by Gaikwad in what could be termed as quality questions.Some of the key topics on which Gaikwad had posed queries include pending proposals under rural schemes, minimum wages, assistance for irrigation projects in the state, sugarcane dues, closure of textile mills, development of the South Central Railways , promotion of the MSME sector and hoarding of pulses, child/bonded labour, spurious medicines and Naxal activities.Gaikwad, who was a college teacher, also raised pressing questions related to the education sector, including the mid-day meal scheme in private schools, irregularities in medical institutions, vocationalisation of secondary education and private school fees.When it comes to debates in Parliament, Gaikwad's participation is again on the lower side.

Scientists from the US and India, after a joint investigation, have concluded that consuming litchi --a tropical fruit Muzaffarpur is famous for- on an empty stomach triggers the illness and death.Seasonal outbreak of the mysterious illness, characterised by acute seizures and changed mental status, has been plaguing Muzaffarpur for nearly two decades. Some similar cases have been reported from Malda in West Bengal.According to researchers, skipping an evening meal results in night-time hypoglycaemia, or low-blood sugar, particularly in children with limited reserve of glycogen -glucose stored in liver and muscles. This triggers oxidation of fatty acids for energy production and generation of glucose. However, naturally-occurring toxins that are found in litchis --hypoglycin A and methylenecyclopropylglycine (MPCG) - disrupt the fatty acid metabolism, leading to acutely low levels of blood sugar. This further affects brain function, leading to acute seizures and stroke. The reserach findings have been published in the latest issue of medical journal The Lancet . For years, many theories were proposed for the seasonal outbreak, including the possibility of pesticide exposure and infectious encephalitis, but no one could confirm anything.In 2013, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in India and US Center for Disease Control initiated a joint investigation into the matter. The hospital-based surveillance involved laboratory investigations to assess potential infectious and non-infectious causes in 390 children less than 15 years old, who were admitted to Shri Krishna Medical College hospital and Krishnadevi Deviprasad Kejriwal maternity hospital -the chief referral medical centres in Muzaffarpur with sudden neurological illness. Of them, 122 (31%) died.On admission, 204 (62%) had lowblood glucose level. Most of them had consumed litchis and parents said they had missed the evening meal the previous day . Parents in affected villages reported that during May and June, children frequently spent their day eating litchis in orchards and many of them returned home in the evening and did not have a meal.""This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest investigation of the Muzaffarpur outbreak and the first comprehensive confirmation that this recurring outbreak illness is associated with litchi consumption and toxicity from both hypoglycin A and MPCG. We confirm the presence of MPCG and hypoglycin in litchis, and, for the first time, our data shows the metabolites of these toxins in human biological specimens, the biological impact of these toxins on human metabolism, and the modifying effect of the lack of an evening meal of the impact of these toxins,"" scientists report in the Lancet study."

Diverse ideas such as the teen phase, addiction to mobile phones, madness, India-Pakistan partition, self-motivation and confessions were used to base plays. Some of the plays, either in Hindi or English, were comedy, tragic, reflective and serious. The plays evoked applaud from the audience, and some acts had them in splits.

They were allowed to ply, but come Friday, even they will join the strike,"" said Durga Prasad, secretary, TS Lorry Owners' Association and leader of SIMTA.Members of SIMTA announced that transport of essential commodities such as water, milk, vegetables, medicines, petrol and LPG would be exempted from the strike. The association will also take a decision on stopping essential commodities, if the government uses force to end the strike or arrests its president or office-bearers. ""We will first stop transportation of LPG gas, followed by other essential commodities if that happens,"" said Prasad.In AP, 80 per cent loading of goods stopped on Thursday. ""By tomorrow, entire 100 per cent loading will come to a halt. The per day loss due to the strike is 20,000 crore across the southern states,"" said Gopal Naidu, president, AP Lorry Owner Association Even as essential goods have been exempted from the strike, few areas in the city reported less supply of vegetables, especially to places which receive supplies from Vicarabad, Siddipet and Tandur by lorries. ""We received just 20 per cent of regular supply of vegetables today,"" said Andullah, a vendor in Kukatpally area The agriculture marketing department is hoping essential commodities will remain undisrupted. ""There will be a huge impact on the Rythu bazaar if they go back on the exemption,"" said Lakshmi Bai, additional director marketing, agriculture and marketing cooperation department."

When they ask PDS shopkeepers about the lack of dal, the standard reply they receive is that these pulses are in short supply, consumers say.Kolathur resident B Gnanasekar said he went to the PDS shop on Paper Mills Road, TT Thottam, where he makes purchases from, a few days ago and bought 5kg of raw rice, 5kg of boiled rice, 5kg of wheat and 1kg of sugar.""We get these items only if we purchase tamarind, soap or pulses,"" he said. ""The PDS shopkeepers force us to buy these items. According to the rules, PDS shops should sell us 10kg each of raw rice and boiled rice but they do not do that.""He said PDS shopkeepers, without embarrassment, sell rice to restaurants, hotels and cafeterias for a higher price in front of their regular customers.

Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao inspected the village on Friday in what was seen as the first move to prepare for the game.Located 18 kilometres away , Alanganallur is where Madurai district's green blanket starts as the city roads make way for lush paddy fields and sugarcane. Even five years ago, almost every house in this town had a game bull, if not a cow. ""Even people who were not economically well off had a cow which would help them tide over tough times,'' said Pandian, a villager. After the ban was imposed on jallikattu three years ago, many homes found it difficult to maintain the bulls, which were given away or sold off. ""Even last year, many people gave the bulls to a gosala in Coimbatore which came forward to take good care of the animals,'' he said.Now with the protests gaining momentum and success very much on the cards, many bull owners are elated.G Renuka Eawari, who has two game bulls, says her `champions' are ready to enter the arena even on Saturday . ""We maintain them well throughout the year and they are ready to show their talent at the word go. We give them special diets every day as the most healthy among the calves are always picked up,'' she said. Hers is a family which has been maintaining game bulls for years. ``I am waiting for the green signal'' she said.The people of the village say they would definitely have to comply with some rules like covering the ground with coconut husk, constructing bamboo barricades and setting up a gallery.Kumaran, a villager, says that they are ready to work through the night to construct the barricades and help the district administration with all the work if the game gets the nod."

Ramadan, the fasting month of Muslim calendar , is about two months away but endocrinologists and general physicians are now busy enrolling with the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) seeking permission to conduct research on fasting and diabetics.At least half a dozen doctors and hospitals from Hyderabad have registered with the CTRI to conduct research during Ramadan, which is scheduled to begin in the last week of May. The focus is on insulin and anti-diabetes drug trials in the city. Ramadan provides the much needed opportunity to researchers to find out the impact of drugs on fasting, particularly if the devout is a diabetic with uncontrolled blood sugar levels.Interestingly, many doctors and hospitals choose new drugs for research during the Islamic holy month. Pharmaceutical companies also join the research race to test if the drugs they manufacture are effective on diabetics during the fasting period. The Ramadan-diabetes study is conducted in dozens of countries including India. Hyderabad with a large Muslim population is the natural choice for pharma companies and hospitals to conduct the trials.According to CTRI data, about two dozen doctors from across India including six from Hyderabad have chosen the drug Lyxumia (Lixisenatide) and Sulfonylurea as add-on treatment to basal insulin for ""randomised, parallel group and active controlled trials during Ramadan 2017. The target group is ""uncontrolled patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, who elect to fast"". A pharma company is sponsoring the research by extending monetary/material support as part of the global research.In a similar study in the earlier years, doctors compared the drug Sitagliptin with Sulfonylurea treatment during Ramadan fasting in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The CTRI data shows that the subjects to be selected under the study are between 18 and 99 years. Both men and women will be included. The trial will last for 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the crescent moon.This year 10 to 20 micrograms of Lixisenatide will be administered through a subcutaneous injection for 12 to 20 weeks as part of the intervention. The researchers will prescribe Sulfonylurea under commercially available formulation. Patients randomised in control arm will continue the sulfonylurea taken prior to study. It is an oral doze for 12 to 20 weeks, the CTRI data reveals."

Anish Kapoor's 'Descension', a whirling black pool of water in the same edition was an attempt to destabilize the experience of the strength of the ground we stand on, pointing to the transience of human existence.In Alfredo Jaar's 'Cloud for Kochi' in KMB 2012, an effective use of neon and water which are symbolic of modernity and history respectively, was employed to place the idea of Kochi and Muziris - the former that came into being with the submergence of the latter underwater - inside an eerie room lit by neon script on the walls made legible only by its reflection on the water.Water or sea, man's first means of escape to outside world, and the element which carried the outside world to Indian shores is a significant part of Kochi's present and of Muziris's past, and thus a persistent motif in the Kochi Muziris Biennale."

Governments worldwide are also seeking to impose taxes on sweetened beverages.Panera will also introduce six new low- and no-sugar teas and lemonades, an extension of the bakery chain's shift away from artificial sweeteners and flavors rolled out last year, company executives said in an interview.Panera said focusing on beverages was the next step to creating a healthier menu, after introducing its clearer labels. Sugary drinks are contributing to U.S. rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease, the company noted.""After food, we clearly felt the role of beverages,"" said Panera's founder and Chief Executive Officer Ron Shaich. ""A 20-ounce Dr Pepper has more sugar than two of our chocolate chip cookies. Which would you rather have?""Panera's new drinks will sit on counters next to the traditional soda fountains, and be offered at the same prices. That will require the company to increase prices in some markets, said Sara Burnett, the company's Director of Wellness and Food Policy.Burnett said the company is reviewing its entire menu based on last year's new sugar labeling guidance.Panera first plans to roll out the new beverages in five U.S. cities, including Washington and Atlanta, and then nationally later this year.

BHP, was still assessing the extent of any disruption to shipments.Queensland's top insurers, Suncorp Group Ltd and RACQ, said it was too early to put a dollar figure on the damage.Severe damage has been inflicted on vegetable and fruit crops in the Bowen and Mackay areas, with potential harm to this year's sugar crop which was due to be harvested in about six weeks' time.The wide region impacted by the cyclone contributes over A$1 billion of agricultural production annually, providing about 95 percent of Australia's winter supply of tomatoes and capsicums, said John Peters, senior economist at Commonwealth Bank.Tourism is another area that has taken a big hit from Debbie, with damage to popular resorts particularly in Whitsundays island which alone accounts for about 10 percent of Australia's tourism earnings.While a lower GDP will not be welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia, it is likely to look through the volatility in the data when setting policy rates. It holds its next policy meeting on April 4.The deleterious impact of the cyclone will likely be short-term with rebuilding and repair activity expected to prop up economic growth in coming months, economists said.""The State, Federal and local governments will rebuild damaged rail, roads, buildings and bridges,"" Peters said.""The private sector will also rebuild the port facilities, marinas, and tourism areas. So the lift in investment could be a substantial positive influences on the June, September and December GDP calculations.""

They are taking help of the state government's vigilance department in their hunt for ""honest, dynamic and workaholic"" IAS and IPS officers.After the decisive mandate in the recent assembly polls in UP, the BJP's focus is now on 2019 Lok Sabha elections. To achieve this goal, the Yogi government's top priority is to deliver the promises made in the Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra.According to an RSS insider, the preparation of the list of IAS and IPS officers is almost complete, and the names are being sent to the vigilance department for verification. Since the selection has to be made from a pool of existing officers, the RSS has decided to overlook their individual ideology.""Irrespective of whether he/she is pro-BJP/RSS or anti, we are considering only if the official is honest and hardworking,"" a senior RSS pracharak told TOI on Sunday, adding that the government's priority is to end mafia raj, corruption and deliver on the poll promises the BJP.Similar criteria would be followed for appointments in various boards, commissions and committees. Citing an example, another senior RSS functionary said that cane development minister Suresh Rana has removed 354 directors in 169 sugarcane committees across the state which act as bridge between farmers and the sugar mills in the state.Even after two weeks in government, Yogi has not made a large-scale official reshuffle as had been the case in previous governments."

Saplings of the plant, native to Salem in Tamil Nadu, will be multiplied by the university and given to tribals for farming in the hilly regions of the state. The product will also be bought back by pharmaceutical companies through TNAU.Salacia Oblonga, also called Ponkoranti, is a medicinal herb believed to be native to India and Sri Lanka. It is used as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in Ayurveda because it contains a molecule called Salacinol, which prevents the body from absorbing the sugar from foods consumed.Recently, professor G P Dubey won an international patent for the herb proving that it originated in India, Salem district in Tamil Nadu to be specific.""I started the research into the plant when I heard a Chinese company applying to patent it. Then we managed to prove it through DNA finger printing and evidence in Tamil literature,"" said professor Dubey. ""There are several species, but we now have to pick the best one for mass propagation and commercial production, because it's market worth is $1.5 billion to $3 billion globally every year,"" he saidHowever, medicinal plant experts say that unfortunately Salacia or Ponkoranti is also slowly becoming an endangered and rare species.""We are now banned from picking any of these medicinal plants from the wild and the availability of Salacia outside reserve forests is becoming rare, because it takes three years to mature and be ready for harvest,"" said the head of the department of medicinal plants, TNAU, K Rajamani.""So, professor Dubey has approached us to try multiplying the Salacia plant through tissue culture, so we can increase production and sell it to Ayurveda and pharmaceutical companies for a nominal cost. He has also insisted that it be multiplied with the help of tribal farmers,"" he said.TNAU is now working out a plan to map out the ecological hotspots across the state and country for the Salacia species. ""We need to pick out as many different specimens of the Salacia, especially Salacia Oblonga, get it first authenticated by the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) authorities,"" said Rajamani.Though the plant originated in Salem, it is found in seven other states in the country, including Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Chattisgarh. ""We will then do a genetic analysis to understand which of them contains the highest amount of Salacinol, and mass propagate them through saplings, seeds or seedlings, whichever is most suitable to the species,"" he said.Once this stage is done, the university will tie up with a group of tribal farmers to farm the medicinal plants in the hills and with a few pharmaceutical companies who will verify the product and buy it back after harvest.""Salacia is a plant that primarily grows in dry hills and Dubey who is an expert in tribal medicine insists that tribals should benefit from it,"" said TNAU vice-chancellor K Ramasamy.""We will sell it to companies for a nominal cost and transfer the benefits wholly to the tribal farmers,"" he said. ""This medicine is mostly grown in the eastern and western ghats and its knowledge is derived from the tribes, who knew its properties and values much before we did,"" said Dubey."

All these led to higher crop productivity and more profitability per hectare of cropped area. Net profit per hectare of cropped area was more than Rs 35,000 in villages adjoining Gir PA, whereas it ranged about Rs 11,000 to Rs 15,000 in the villages that were over 15km away. The magnitude of total profit from agriculture was to the tune of Rs 6,020.05 million per annum.""Then, the annual estimated value of environmental benefits from Gir PA was about Rs 10,575.71 million which included benefits from carbon sequestration.A P Singh, chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Junagadh, said, ""We plan to revisit the same study to assess the various aspects of Gir ecosystem's benefits to people living around it.""The study was undertaken as there was dearth of quantification of economic analysis from the forest resources so as to help policy makers.According to the study, maintenance of Gir PA should be accorded high priority considering that the total economic value was to the tune of nearly Rs 211 crore a year.""Estimation of environmental benefits is a complex procedure. The total economic value (TEV) concept is widely used in the environmental economics parlance. The same was used in the present study. All efforts were made to quantify maximum identified benefits. Both primary and secondary data were collected,"" Shiyani added."

While continuing with their usual medications, they are opting for the alternate system of treatment to keep the ailments under control and to modify their lifestyle.Yoga camps are being conducted in Andhra University to address the problems of obesity and diabetes besides diet counselling. With the right kind of asanas and pranayamas, a healthy and balanced diet and with the right mindset to control stress and anxiety, experts said diabetes can be controlled and minimised. Obesity and diabetes are interlinked and obesity is the root cause or condition behind several other ailments such as cardiac problems, stroke, diabetes, hypertension and arthritis.""Given the demand, we are conducting a yoga camp for diabetic patients after testing all their medical parameters, sugar level, body mass index (BMI) and so on. Daily, one hour of yoga is enough and gradually as per one's capacity, the difficulty level of the asanas can be enhanced. However, it's mandatory that one takes up yoga under the supervision of a qualified teacher or instructor and not try to do on one's own by watching the internet. Practising and following the right posture is very important, otherwise there would be pains and side effects,"" said Prof TV Anandrao, director of the department of yoga at AU. Assistant professor R Tulasi Rao, naturopathy and yoga specialist from AU said that a variety of asanas, pranayams and meditation techniques can be followed for 45 minutes to one hour. But the particular dhanurasana (bow pose) should be practised for 3-5 minutes daily as it's one of the most effective asanas for diabetic patients. Besides this, tadasana, triyaktadasana, pavanmuktasana, ardhamatchandrasana, bhujangasana, salbhasana should be practised.""To control weight-gain and obesity, 12 poses of suryanamaskarams can be practised in two rounds, repeating each posture six times. In between the two rounds, savasana or rest should be taken. This is an effective way to burn calories. Besides, trikonasana and veerabhadrasana can address problems of abdominal fat deposition or android obesity. Apart from these, the pavanmuktasana series, navasana, bhujangasana and salbhasana can be practised as well. Daily 45 minutes of asanas, 10 minutes of pranayama with five minutes of rest can go a long way in controlling obesity,"" said Prof Rao."

Whereas other nine are still working at lower capacity, but are likely to close in a month.The basic cause of less yield is lack of rains in June and heavy rains in later part of monsoon.Sameer Bhakta, chairman of Madhi Sugar Cooperative Mill, said, ""We have stopped crushing since February 23. We used to get per acre yield of 29 tonne but this year we are getting only 23-24 tonne per acre."" The mill gets sugarcane from 30,000 acres of land.""In Gujarat we are 20-30% short of yield this year, whereas in Maharastra situation is worse.

A native of the famed Malakpur, a village of wrestlers in UP's Baghpat district, the 'pehelwan' (wrestler) is contesting Assembly election from Baraut seat on a SP ticket.As a young man, SP founder Mulayam was fond of wrestling. On many occasions, he defeated his rivals using 'charkha daon', a wrestling manoeuvre Mulayam became synonymous with even outside the ring. This surprise move involved tossing one's rival in the air like a wheel and flooring him within seconds.Tomar, who openly claims that UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is his role model, believes that Akhilesh has inherited simplicity from his father Mulayam. ""I first met Netaji (Mulayam) during a wrestling tournament in Saifai in 1998. Like all participants, I asked him to teach us the famous charkha daon. He taught us on the condition to show in the ring what we learnt. I passed the test by grasping the method correctly and won his blessings besides an 'inam' (prize),"" recalled Shokinder.Extremely busy with his ""Gaon-gaon sampark yatra"" (door-to-door march), Tomar is talking of Akhilesh's vision of clean politics. ""I'm contesting elections because the party president (Akhilesh) wants good candidates to win and work for the cause of the people,"" Tomar told TOI.Though his party stood third on the seat in 2012 elections, Tomar prefers to be optimistic. Locals feel that the contest is between sitting BSP MLA Lokesh Dixit and RLD candidate Sahab Singh. Struggling to keep up with the mannerism of a politician, Tomar banks on 55% young voters on his seat. ""I am being honest with everyone and I know it appeals,"" said Tomar who is also a recipient of Yash Bharti award (2006).About the issues in his constituency, Tomar said, ""All may not be able to make it to international matches, but every heart in my district and constituency throbs for sports. Still, there are no specialised dedicated facilities to help youth practice. I have pledged to do something for my bretheren. Then, we are an agrarian economy and issues like cane dues and arm twisting by sugar mills constantly haunts farmers in the region. I promise a solution to their problems.""WRESTLING IT OUT FOR VOTER AWARENESS:Wrestlers are already a revered lot in western UP. While Shokinder has entered the poll arena, others including, Dangal girls Gita Babita and Sandeep Tomar, are working for voter awareness. While Bagpat administration has declared Sandeep Tomar as their brand ambassador for elections, Meerut DM B Chandrakala engaged Phogat sisters in the ongoing campaign called ""Vote karega Meerut"". That's not all, in Bagpat, administrative officers participating in voter awareness meets are using wrestling and other sports activities to drive the voters. Each meet is preceded by a small wrestling or volleyball match. Talking to TOI, DM Bagpat Hriday Shankar Tiwari said, ""Wrestlers are a role model in their way because of their disciplined way of life. Media limelight turns them into a celebrity and therefore we thought of engaging them for the cause of democracy.""VILLAGE OF WRESTLERS MALAKPUR: Wrestling is said to have its roots in Bagpat from times of Mahabharata, but in Malakpur, the tradition assumed an organised shape in the 1970s when Iqbal and Harpal, the disciples of Khalifa (master) Dariyav Singh opened an akhara. Today, more than 2,000 youths from Shamli, Khekhda, Loni, Shahdara, Chaprauli, Kirthal and Barhaut practice the sport. Despite lacking modern facilities, the village has given more than 15 international and 50 national players. Of late, many wrestlers are proving their worth in kabaddi as well. The village also hosts a mega dangal each year."

Is the audience ready to buy tickets to watch performance of local artists?""""Lets make way for theatre,"" she added.Underlying the importance of introspection for theatre actors, she shared an example of how artists are trained in south India. Artists dedicate themselves to learn Nerabhinaya or mannerism, she said.Dinkar Bedekar, a senior theatre person, discussed the problem of declining scriptwriting skills. ""Theatre involves actions, presentation and dialogues recitation. But the most important aspect at the heart of all these things is script writing. Sadly, those skills have declined recent times.""He also emphasized themes like magic and reality through a small drama Ice of Blue Dog presented by Madhuri Bedekar and Supantho Bhattacharya. Madhusudhan Penna , a reader at Kalidas University, discussed Kalidas's contribution to Indian theatre while Bhattacharya talked about Hindi film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays.""Shakespeare never wrote any original drama.

Rohit Kabra, an MBA Finance student of IIPS College says, ""The college canteen provides chaas in tetra packs and I choose that over juice. It keeps me hydrated and since it is available in a tetra pack there's no worry about hygiene as well. Soda-shikanji is another option that many people go for.""Sugarcane juice walas can be spotted at every nook and corner of the city.

Since it's easily available and costs only `10, we make two trips a day to these stalls."" Besides sugarcane juice, nariyal pani is also a hot favourite among youngsters. Anushi Jain, an under-grad student of Prestige College adds, ""A nice canopy has been erected near our college where nariyal pani is served. We spend time there post college hours.

But now the people have seen the reality of BJP -- the broken promises and its communal politics.""Speaking of the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots which created a rift between the Jats and Muslims in the western UP, and wrecked the carefully-crafted social equation considered to be the strength of RLD in the region, he said, ""The BJP created social tensions between the two communities which led to the riots. It was a well planned and executed plot of the BJP. That is the only reason that they won the 2014 elections, where they won 73 out of 80 seats in UP. They only won because of this polarisation. Their only job is to divide people. We are here to get people together. We will not allow people to get divided. We will not allow the BJP come to power.""In a well-attended rally, Ajit Singh launched an offensive against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Modiji knows only two things: to speak well and dress well. He changes his clothes four times a day, you can learn about fashion from him. He also speaks well. He makes so many promises every time he speaks. None of those promises have been fulfilled. Instead of fulfilling his promises, Modiji introduced notebandi which hurt the poor immensely. People could not sow their fields, they could not get money for fertilizers and pesticides. Farmers were hurt badly. Modiji will make some more promises this time also, but do not fall in the trap,"" he said.""He went to Saharanpur and said that the dues of sugarcane farmers have been paid. Then he went to Meerut and said the same thing. But, the truth is that the farmers have not been paid anything, you are still waiting for your dues of over two years. Modiji has only made false claims and false promises. He doesn't even know how much money is owed to farmers,"" Singh said.Singh listed out his plans for the welfare of farmers if his party was voted to power. ""We will work for our farmer brothers. We will ensure that all previous dues from the sugar mills, including the interest amounts, are paid. We will set up a farmers' commission which will look into the problems that the farmer faces. There will be a separate agriculture budget. We will be a government of the farmers and the poor people,"" the RLD chief said.Hitting out at both SP and BSP, Singh said, ""Mulayam Singh has himself said that some of the party's MLAs and MLCs are corrupt. Akhilesh Yadav's government was involved in large-scale corruption which hurt the poor people. With Mayawati, it is well-known that she is here to loot people.""With sizeable 25% Jat votes in Sivalkhas, RLD is a strong player in the region. Former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh had been elected MLA from here three times in the 80s and 90s. Yashvir Singh, the party's candidate, had lost in the 2012 assembly polls narrowly to Ghulam Mohammed of the SP. With both candidates again in the fray, and two other strong candidates of the BSP and BJP, this will be a contest to watch out for."

As the clouds gradually gave way to a warm winter sun, the yoga was followed by a lively zumba dance, where like every week, people of all age groups enthusiastically participated and this time, bhangra beats enlivened the show all the more. The final onstage event was a dance performance by tiny tots.However, the main attraction of this Sunday's Happy Streets was juggling and hula hoop dance by artists from The Great Bombay Circus. Noor Mohammad enthralled the onlookers with his juggling feats using footballs, ping pong balls, water filled glasses, hats and discs. Ring dancer Poonam Yadav too mesmerised everyone with her ring dance and calisthenics using multiple rings, even using 24 rings at a time.Near the Viztory At Sea memorial, some Vizagites were found flying colourful kites ushering in the Sankranti spirit. Some were making kites as well. Sanjay Sajnani, manager at CMR Shopping Mall , said, ""I am a regular walker and Beach Road is the ideal place for morning walks. But today, it's all about kites. I just love flying kites. It's my hobby and Sankranti time is best for flying kites.""Even the chalk arts on road such as kites and sugarcane sticks and 'Happy Pongal' messages drawn by children all pointed to Sankranti motifs and greetings.Apart from the above, a good crowd was noticed before the archery zone, shuttle corner, basketball and so on.

The board has agreed in principle to announce mid-exam 'snack break' for such students in the upcoming class 10 and 12 board exams.While some schools have been maintaining records, others have also started the practice so that a list can be submitted to the board when it asks them to give details.""At the time of admission itself, we ask parents to submit all medical records of students so that we are aware of students' condition. In our school, there are two children suffering from Type-1 diabetes,"" said Seetha Murthy, principal, Silver Oaks School . ""We are not doctors and having medical records will prepare us for emergency situations,"" she said, appreciating the CBSE's decision to provide a snack break for students.Anandavalli K, principal, DAV Public School , said ensuring students health and safety will be easier with access to their medical records. ""We don't maintain any special records, but ask parents to list out if their children need any special care. Now with CBSE's move, we will make a list of students suffering from this type of diabetes also,"" said Anandavalli. ""Even before the board took the decision, we used to allow children with certain medical problems to have snacks in between classes,"" she said.The relief for diabetic students was considered by the CBSE after Dr Ashok Jhingan, chairperson of Delhi Diabetes Research Centre , approached it on the matter. He buttressed his request with results from a study in four Kendriya Vidyalayas that had allowed its students with Type-1 diabetes to have a mid-exam snack.According to doctors, type-1 diabetic patients, need two to four insulin injections every day to keep their sugar levels balanced and should not have too long a break between snacks. Low sugar levels could cause headaches, irritability , restlessness, and confusion.CBSE will soon issue a notice that diabetic students will be allowed a snack break during exams -an hour or 90 minutes from the start of the test.In the city, there are 122 schools affiliated to the CBSE and approximately 15, 000 children are suffering from this type of diabetes."

""This is likely to be driven by a lower off-take of sugar from the PDS, short-term consumption loss post demonetisation as well as impacted demand from bulk consumers such as soft drink manufacturers, bakeries, confectioners, hotels and restaurants, which account for around 60%-70% of milled sugar demand,"" ratings agency ICRA said.The union government has withdrawn the Rs 4,500-crore subsidy for state governments who distribute subsidised sugar through the PDS applicable from 2017-18. ""Sugar sales and off-take from sugar mills is substantially lower as compared to last year,"" Indian Sugar Mills' Association (ISMA) said. ""We have already received reports from all sugar mills, and noted that up to end of January, sales by sugar mills has been lower by 7.5 lakh tonnes,"" it said.The anticipated lower demand by state governments and drop in sugar purchase by the bulk consumers would impact consumption, ISMA stated. ISMA expects that the sugar sales in the current season to be between 23.8 million and 24 million tonnes.""Apart from these short-term developments which have impacted the off-take in the current year, increasing health consciousness among consumers is likely to impact the off-take of certain food products such as white sugar and oils in the long run,"" ICRA said.""Several F&B (food and beverages) manufacturers such as beverage bottlers and confectionery players have already stated their intent to reduce the amount of sugar content in their products in the near to medium term,"" it said.The drop in demand impact is unlikely to affect the sugar prices and profitability trends in the current season as the impact of the decline in the domestic sugar consumption is likely to be more than offset by a higher-than-expected decline in sugar production, observers said.Sugar production would be only around 20.3 million tonnes, ISMA estimated. Sugar production is expected to be lower than consumption by around 3-3.5 million tonnes. This would result in closing stocks at around 4- 4.2 million tonnes, which would be sufficient to meet the requirement of around two months of domestic consumption."

'What might be people in places that are conflict-inflicted, war prone or do not have enough food surviving on?' Her thoughts led her towards a new project named Starvation Cookbook, a series of recipes that aren't like anything you might ever get to taste, unless thrown into a situation of extreme living conditions. Karolina, who was recently at Kochi Biennale , staged her performance 'Hunger is/isn't an object,' documenting 14 instances of extreme starvation from across the world.Bread baked out of bark flour, cookies from mud, potato peels, black sugar, grass and water mixed with petrol, jelly made from carpenter's glue, water and salt soup eaten by residents in Syria... the taste of all these dishes are unique, as they represent hunger. 'Their purpose is not nourishment, but survival. And, a lot of people on famine belts and warzones in our world survive on them on a daily basis,"" says Karolina.Ask her what prompted her into taking up such a project and she says, ''Probably my interest in cooking. This thought struck me especially at a time when I was going through a phase in which I wasn't happy enjoying the space of an artist. I found respite in cooking, and exploring various recipes. On one such day, a thought about people who are famished, especially in areas where hunger is artificially created through wars and conflicts, struck me and I began my research on it. Starvation Cookbook is the result of the same,"" she says.According to her, what makes all human being equal is the fact that we have to consume our daily share of food for survival. An empty plate can reflect problems around the world quite well, she says. ""My project explores the condition of extreme hunger, the political or economic reasons for it and the survival mechanisms and sustenance measures adopted by local communities. It is something you can find everywhere. For example, if you go to a fancy Indian restaurant in London, you might find the most top quality dish  but the country would definitely have some unique recipes which the poor there would have been surviving on, for years together. For instance, take the case of kanji  which is quite tasty for a change and helped many in Bengal and Kerala survive at hard times,"" she says.With Starvation Cookbook, Karolina hopes to reveal the bitter differences between the taste of war, collectivization and inflation. ''It will get us closer to a notion of what the 'world food' really means,'' she signs off."

Around 4pm, they heard the cries of the cubs, a male and a female, and found them in the field. Fearing that the mother leopard might be nearby and could attack them, the workers panicked and immediately contacted the forest department.Forest department official Sanjay Gaikwad had reached spot and informed Wildlife SOS veterinarian Ajay Deshmukh working at Manikdoh leopard rescue centre in Junnar. ""Luckily, when we reached, none of the workers had handled the cubs. Both were about 21 days old, and we checked them for any injuries, wounds or parasites. They turned out healthy, so we decided to reunite them with the mother,"" Deshmukh told TOI.It could be tricky, he said. ""We have conducted nearly 60 reunions of leopard cubs with their families since 2009. Being from the cat family, the mother leopard will always come back to find her young at the spot where she may have left them to go hunting. However, it is also important to ensure that minimal human interaction takes place with the cubs. Hence, we use sterilised gloves to handle the cubs and ensured only one person should be around them,"" he explained, adding that if the mother leopard suspects human interference, she may get aggressive.Around 7pm, the cubs were placed back at the same spot where they were found, and kept in a safe box to ensure they stayed put. The rescuers had decided to document the reunion. They placed two remote-controlled camera traps to capture the images and footage and monitored from a distance.""Around two and half hours later, the mother emerged from the forest at 9.30pm. The images indicate how much she missed them,"" Deshmukh said. The mother cautiously examined her cubs first. Satisfied, she was happy to see them and carried them off by the scruff of their necks.Sightings CommonThe end of winter being the birthing season for leopards, it is common to find cubs. The mother leopard which nurses, feeds and teaches survival to the young ones, leaves them in the safety of dens or tall sugarcane plantations, while she goes to hunt. However, since this also the harvesting season for the crop, cubs are often found alone by farmers. ""It is not uncommon to spot leopards in this area, as there are several sugarcane fields that provide a safe cover for these wild cats. But this also gives rise to conflict situations when farmers harvest sugarcane,"" Gaikwad said."

This concoction is poured into a copper barrel, or 'sancha', which is placed in a wooden barrel of ice. The mixture is then churned by an old hand - also coincidentally named Vali - until it solidifies. Taj is one of the last hand-churned ice-cream parlours left in the city.Valiji's original recipe of milk, sugar and fruits - no colours or preservatives - has remained largely unchanged over the years. But the shop now offers 15 flavours including mango, kesar, tender coconut, and roasted almond chocolate chip, all sold at Rs 60 a scoop to about a hundred customers daily. Sitafal, however, remains the favourite and is often carried by NRIs back to Karachi, Kuwait and London. (A loyal customer even inspired the shop name: Tajbhai, a friend of Valiji's son, who would travel to Mumbai from Ahmedabad just to eat the ice-cream.)Despite the lack of advertising and modest outlet - now on Bhendi Bazaar 's Khara Tank Road - many celebrities have sampled the fruity dessert including Farooq Abdullah, Pankaj Udhas Johnny Walker and Madhubala . A 1969 banquet in honour of the Shah of Iran gave bulk orders for Taj ice cream and Delhi Darbar's biryani. ""The Iran consulate made it a condition,"" recalls Hatim Icecreamwala, ""They told the Taj that we will occupy your hotel but during the party these two items will come from outside.""Both father and son are ice-cream fanatics. ""Whenever we travel, the first thing we try is ice-cream,"" says Aamir, who used to churn ice-cream for fun after school and joined the family business last year after quitting a real estate job in Dubai.The shop will be bulldozed under the Bhendi Bazaar redevelopment plan but the Icecreamwalas have been assured alternative accommodation while construction is underway - and a similar street-front location once the project is complete. Aamir says they aren't perturbed by new fads like frozen yogurt and liquid nitrogen ice-cream because their customers crave an ""authentic, organic, milky"" flavour.They recently registered their outlet on Scootsy, Faroma and Zomato, delighting many of their farther-flung customers. ""The idea is also to reach out to many people who don't know about Taj,"" says Aamir. ""We want to continue the legacy."""
58f6da0d7be9e031f13bcf02,Tourism department’s plan to recreate Sholay magic in Ramanagara hits green hurdle,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tourism-depts-plan-to-recreate-sholay-magic-in-ramanagara-hits-green-hurdle/articleshow/58036143.cms,2017-04-06,"BENGALURU: The forest and tourism departments are on a collision course over the latter's proposal to develop a virtual reality village themed on Bollywood blockbuster Sholay amid the rocky terrain of Ramanagara.The tourism department wants to set up the 3D village near Ramadevara Betta, an hour's drive from Bengaluru. The idea is to offer visitors the Sholay experience on the very location where it was shot. ""We are toying with the idea of developing it into a unique tourist destination by blending the film experience with adventure sports. The Ramanagara boulders are suitable for rock climbing. If the forest department has any objection, we will convince them,"" said tourism minister Priyank Kharge.The forest department, however, is not on board. All wings of the department have opposed the plan, saying it would amount to intrusion into forest area. While most of the land around Ramadevara Betta is a protected forest area, the hillock itself has been declared a vulture sanctuary as it houses the endangered long-billed vultures.""We will never permit them to set foot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara since it is a protected forest. Forget developing a tourist destination, we will not even allow a research project,"" said B J Hosmath, managing director, Forest Development Corporation. ""The forest department's map says 280 acres around Ramadevara Betta was notified as forest land in 1917. The law prohibits anyone from entering the area,"" said a senior forest officer.K S Sugara, principal chief conservator of forests, said the proposal is not in the interest of wildlife conservation. ""I cannot understand why anyone wants to experience a film in a forest land. If you want to enjoy a film like Sholay, you can go to a theatre,"" said Sugara.The Karnataka Eco Tourism Development Board (KEDB) feels the tourism department should not decide on such projects unilaterally. ""We haven't got any formal communication on the project. It should not be allowed,"" said Vinay Luthra, chairman, KEDB.Forest officials said if Sholay is remade, Ramanagara's hills would be off limits for the makers, given the existing rules.The Rs 15 crore project envisages developing the 3D virtual reality village on a 42,000 sqft locale to recreate Ramgarh of Sholay by this year-end. Tourists would get to interact with favourite Sholay characters such as Gabbar Singh, Basanti, Veeru and Jai. The project may be executed on a public private partnership (PPP) model and a private company is being considered for it.This isn't the first time that the government is mulling commercialization of the terrain. In 2010, the government proposed to give 300 acres of land surrounding Ramadevara Betta to an Andhra Pradesh-based construction company, Ananthara Resorts, to build a resort themed on Sholay. The then forest minister V S Acharya backtracked after widespread public outrage, leading to the project being shelved.""What's alarming is that the government wants to involve private parties every time it comes up with an idea to develop tourism development in Ramanagara. The proposal looks like a repeat of the BJP government's move in 2010,"" said Sharath Champati, a naturalist.The rocks of Ramanagara are a natural habitat for long-billed vultures. A census conducted 50 years ago revealed 77 vultures had made the rocks their home. Over the years, the vulture population has come down; just nine vultures were spotted in 2010. As a result, 346.41 hectares of the hillock area, part of a reserve forest, was declared a vulture sanctuary on January 30, 2012, and cordoned off with chain-link fencing. Although no census was conducted, the forest department counted 12 hatchlings in 2014.""The tourism department should be sensitive. They can develop an adventure destination elsewhere,"" said Anish Andheria, president, Widlife Conservation Trust. ""If the government chooses to ignore green concerns and go ahead with the project, it will only lead to a movement against the project,"" Andheria added."

Shares of large U.S. pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are selling off after Trump says he is working on a system to reduce prices in the industry. TRUMP'S TAXES Senate Democrats, seeking to capitalize on revelations about the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia, are urging a top Republican lawmaker to obtain the president's tax returns as a matter of national security. ADMINISTRATION The prosecutor tapped to fill the No. 2 position at the Justice Department declines to commit to appointing a special counsel to oversee an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The Senate Armed Services Committee votes overwhelmingly to approve Army Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster as Trump's second national security adviser, despite some concern about his handling of a sexual assault case. IRAN The Trump administration pledges in a statement to show ""great strictness"" over restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities imposed by a deal with major powers but gives little indication of what that might mean for the agreement. NORTH KOREA The United States starts deploying the first elements of its advanced anti-missile defense system in South Korea after North Korea's test of four ballistic missiles, U.S. Pacific Command says, despite angry opposition from China. AUTOS Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and 11 other Democrats say it is critical that the Trump administration retain new vehicle fuel efficiency rules, arguing that the higher standards are achievable. TRADE Mexico cancels existing sugar export permits to the United States to avoid penalties in a dispute over the pace of shipments, blaming the problem in part on unfilled positions at the U.S. Department of Commerce, according to a document seen by Reuters.

""But now we have the federal government involved.""Wilmar did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The issue had been a thorn in the government's side, adding to pressures that has led to a slump for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his Liberal Party-led coalition government.Frustration peaked when a Queensland Liberal Party lawmaker, George Christensen, threatened to resign over the issue, a defection that would have eroded Turnbull's majority in parliament.""This is a win for the little guy against a multinational behemoth,"" Christensen said in a statement. ""This has been a long drawn-out battle and growers have suffered tremendous pressure as a result.""The government intervention comes as growers in one region begin to count the cost of Cyclone Debbie, which struck the country's northeast on Tuesday.Hundreds of hectares of sugarcane crops have been flattened, industry body Canegrowers estimates, though damage assessments may take several weeks.(Editing by Jane Wardell and Joseph Radford)"

During summer , these stall owners rake in the moolah as almost everyone travelling in the heat will stop by to quench their thirst.Although fresh fruit juice scores more over aerated colas, most people often opt for light meals such as a plate of fresh fruit or a glass of chaas or lassi. Most lemon juice vendors sell anything between 150 to 200 glasses a day. And on weekends these numbers go up to 300 to 350. ""Customers always want something to quench their thirst,"" said Ganesh Pawar, a seller.Sugarcane juice vendors are in most demand as this is the best summer cooler and it is easily available almost everywhere. ""Sugarcane is bought from the wholesale market, sometimes thrice a week if there is a demand,'' said Nitin Tawde, a sugarcane seller.Meanwhile, college students and working professionals at times give their meals a skip and stick to a plate of fruits which is high on flavour as well as nutrition. ''Fruit plates are complete value for money. Most students find it affordable and also filling,'' said Manish Gaikwad, a student. While some sellers only serve watermelons, others serve a mix of oranges, sweet lines, kiwis, bananas and chickoos.However, there are some who prefer water to colas and other juices. Many companies have started packing water in small carry-size bottles as it is easy for a person to carry. ''Water is the only thing that can quench a person's thirst. Colas and juices do not satisfy you,'' said Kashmira Sinha, a working professional. Many vendors also sell packaged water bottles at signals and stations."

Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao inspected the village on Friday in what was seen as the first move to prepare for the game.Located 18 kilometres away, Alanganallur is where Madurai district's green blanket starts as the city roads make way for lush paddy fields and sugarcane. Even five years ago, almost every house in this town had a game bull, if not a cow. ""Even people who were not economically well off had a cow which would help them tide over tough times,'' said Pandian , a villager. After the ban was imposed on jallikattu three years ago, many homes found it difficult to maintain the bulls, which were given away or sold off. ""Even last year, many people gave the bulls to a gosala in Coimbatore which came forward to take good care of the animals,'' he said.Now with the protests gaining momentum and success very much on the cards, many bull owners are elated. G Renuka Eawari , who has two game bulls, says her 'champions' are ready to enter the arena even on Saturday. ""We maintain them well throughout the year and they are ready to show their talent at the word go. We give them special diets every day as the most healthy among the calves are always picked up,'' she said. Hers is a family which has been maintaining game bulls for years. ""I am waiting for the green signal,'' she said.The people of the village say they would definitely have to comply with some rules like covering the ground with coconut husk, constructing bamboo barricades and setting up gallery. Kumaran , a villager, says that they are ready to work through the night to construct the barricades and help the district administration with all the work if the game gets the nod.Meanwhile, P Rajasekhar, president of Jallikattu Paadukaapu Peravai , says that bulls and bull tamers are ready even if the game is to be conducted at 10 places simultaneously. But the preparations would take a minimum of one or two days. ""We also do not know what guidelines are going to be issued along with the ordinance,'' he said.Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao said that they were fully prepared to act as per the instructions of the government at any time."

BJP national president, while releasing the manifesto, said, ""temple and development can go hand-in-hand.""Called the 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra', the manifesto focuses on issues that the party has been raising over the years in UP - law and order, corruption, illegal mining and the menace of land grabbing. It has promised a task force each to check corruption, illegal mining and land grabbing. It has also promised loan waiver for farmers and clearing of sugarcane dues, issues plaguing a large section of farmers in the state.The Ram temple issue forms a part of the manifesto, though it remains unchanged from the way it was during the Lok Sabha elections in 2014.

Instead, it tabled a budget on Saturday for 2017-18 which allocates roughly Rs 14,000 crore to the agricultural sector, mainly for irrigation. The state also proposed doubling agricultural income by 2021.Last year, which witnessed one of the worst droughts Maharashtra has seen in recent memory, the state had allocated Rs 25,000 crore to agriculture, including Rs 7,000 crore for irrigation.In financial terms, the budget projects a revenue shortfall of Rs 4,511 crore. However, last year's initial and later figures on revenue deficit vary widely. In 2016-17, the state's initial figure was Rs 3,644 crore, but the revised estimate was Rs 14,377 crore.The state's debt is expected to balloon to over Rs 4 lakh crore. Regardless of the rising debt, the budget allocates Rs 200 crore to build statues: memorials of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Babasaheb Ambedkar and Bal Thackeray.The budget also allocates less to capital expenditure used for asset and infrastructure spendingthan the previous year. In 2016-17, the revised capital expenditure was Rs 37,058 crore. In the 2017-18 budget the allocation is Rs 35,504 crore.The budget was presented amid loud protests from the opposition Congress and NCP . The BJP-led government's alliance partner, Shiv Sena, which had joined the protests in the run-up to the budget, back-tracked and cooperated during the budget presentation.The opposition has dismissed the farm allocation as misleading. ""These so-called allocations to the farm sector are nothing but financial jugglery. The budget is hugely disappointing to farmers,"" said NCP's Dhananjay Munde.""A farm loan waiver will require Rs 30,500 crore, and there is no guarantee the farmer will be out of debt for good. Instead we are investing in the farm sector,"" countered CM Devendra Fadnavis. He said the state had also approached the Centre to help in extending institutional credit to farmers who had defaulted on loans.Within the budget's farm sector spend, the main focus is irrigation. The budget allocates Rs 8,233 crore to the water resources department and Rs 1,200 crore for the state's water conservation scheme, the Jalyukta Shivar Yojana. An allocation of Rs 2,812 crore has been made under the PM's Krishi Sinchai Yojana. Another Rs 225 crore has been set aside for its wells and farm ponds scheme and Rs 250 crore for Marathwada 's irrigation. A sum of Rs 100 crore has been allocated to micro-irrigation schemes in Vidarbha and Rs 979 crore towards agricultural pumps.In order to boost farm income, the budget has set aside Rs 200 crore to set up Farmer Producer Companies for group farming and marketing.Given that Goods and Service Tax (GST) is expected to be introduced from July 1, the state government has not introduced any new taxes, nor proposed an increase in taxes, except for liquor and tax on lottery.Tax on lotteries which are payable by organisers stands increased by Rs 30,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Liquor is out of the GST ambit and with an increase in the VAT rate on MRP of country and foreign liquor to 25.93% from the existing 23.08%, the state will stand to gain.For the purpose of compensation to the state, under GST, the annual growth rate of 14% on the revenue for the financial year 2015-16 shall be considered. The compensation amount shall also include octroi in Mumbai (approx Rs 6,500 crore) and local body tax.The budget has exempted sugarcane purchase tax from 2015-2017 to sugar factories. This will generate Rs 700 crore which they could use to pay the cane price to farmers, it says. The budget also exempts the 13.5% VAT on card swipe machines to encourage cashless transactions.In line with the Centre's budget, the state budget has merged plan and non-plan expenditure. The change will bring more flexibility to each department to use their department allocation instead of only the plan component, which is only 25% of the total size of the budget, the state says."

The Indian diaspora emphasized the need for making Geet Gawai a recognized cultural expression and worked towards it. One such Mauritian who was instrumental in getting the ""intangible heritage"" tag for Geet Gawai was Sarita Boodhoo , the chairperson of Mauritius Bhojpuri speaking union and head of Global Woman Council of GOPIO Is Bhojpuri still popular in Mauritius?Following the abolition of slavery, the British brought labourers from India to work in sugarcane plantations of Mauritius. The first batch of 36 indentured Indian labourers arrived in Port Louis in 1834 from Bihar, the Bhojpuri speaking belt. The number of Girmitiyas (indentured labour force from India) grew and today a whopping 54% of the Indian diaspora in Mauritius speaks Bhojpuri.How has Geet Gawai been a binding force for the Indian diaspora? Geet Gawai, which has its roots in B i h a r, is a r i c h collec tion of songs, proverbs and stories. It has been orally passed on from one generation to another and the womenfolk have played a key role in keeping this cultural tradition alive. Geet Gawai has not only been a binding force in the family as children get to learn from their parents, it has also kept the community together as the musical ensemble is an integral part of weddings.Several oral traditions have become extinct in the modern times.Yes, Geet Gawai, too, faced challenges. In the last 1970s we realized that the women in Mauritius and other Girmitiya countries such as Fiji, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago were mov ing away from the traditional cultural expression and were embracing modern trends. We realized that the number of women associated with Geet Gawai was diminishing.How did the turnaround happen?We elders in the Bhojpuri community felt it was high time something had to be done or else the future generations will forget Geet Gawai and will subsequently disconnect with the Indian culture. We started the Mauritius Bhojpuri Institute in 1982 and the basic idea behind it was to institutionalize the oral traditions because only then people take it seriously .This apart, we did not want Geet Gawai to be confined to the four walls, so we started organizing public functions and pageants.Soon, the Bhojpuri Institute became an andolan and we started giving the singers, referred to as Geetharines, more importance. The Geetharines started performing in public and we invited the country's elite, especially those from other ethnic groups, to come and attend Geet Gawai sessions.This generated a lot of curiosity and more people started showing interest in Geet Gawai. In the meantime, we started conducting workshops and tried telling youngsters the importance and meaning of the songs.The underlying message that we have been driving home is happiness and unity.How has the government of Mauritius supported the initiative?In 2012, the Mauritius government set up various speaking unions and they announced the Bhojpuri speaking union. I was appointed as the chairperson. It is here that we felt the need to recognize Geet Gawai as a cultural expression at the global level. I was invited by the Mauritius government to defend Geet Gawai at UNESCO. We are happy that Geet Gawai has been given the `intangible heritage' status. While the Geet Gawai songs are in Bhojpuri the script is in Devanagari."

After unspeakable ordeals in four different houses, she was finally able to sneak out and call her family in Hyderabad, thanks to a Bangladeshi national who took pity on her and allowed her to use his cell phone.Noor Jehan Begum, 38, was rescued after city police swiftly acted on a complaint lodged by her husband, Mohd Azam, and mounted pressure on a local agent from Kanchanbagh to bring her back.MBT leader Amjedullah Khan, who was approached by the family, pursued the case with police and also wrote to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and urged the consul general of India in Jeddah for help.""Not just Noor Jehan, at east 25 other women from Old City were lured by an agent to go to Saudi Arabia with promises of hefty salaries and more work opportunities. No one should fall prey to agents and ruin their lives,"" Amjedullah Khan told TOI.As Noor Jehan's husband Mohd Azam was steeped in debt, she agreed to go to Saudi after being promised a salary of `20,000-30,000 per month.She was first taken from Hyderabad to Delhi and then flown to Sharjah on a tourist visa. She was then taken to Dubai and finally to Medina, where her woes began.""I was forced to work in five different houses. I had to work till 3 in the morning without food. My sugar levels shot up to 350 mg. Nobody heard my pleas,"" said Noor Jehan Begum. In one house, there were nine children and she was shackled with work. She was also put in solitary confinement if she complained about work.After she couldn't suffer the harassment in the first house, she expressed the desire to return home. This infuriated her employer, who confined her in a car for two days.She was not given food or water. Since Saudi women are not allowed to venture outside alone, Noor Jehan had to stealthily go into a nearby mosque to attend nature's call and drink water. In her second assignment, there were four families with 40 occupants in the house.She had to do all the household work. ""I was asked to cook. I told them I could not cook their special dishes. I suffered severe chest pain, but they were not interested,"" said Noor Jehan.After three months of torment, she returned on December 16 last year.""I request women in Old City not to fall prey to smooth talk of agents and go to Saudi Arabia. It is better to skip a meal and live in Hyderabad than go and suffer there,"" she said."

Every year, this farmer would give away some of his high-quality seeds to neighbours. Later, a lucrative breeze would usher pollen from their crops to his farm. This cross-pollination would bring him not only the best crop but also the ''best farmer' award annually. The moral of this story narrated breathlessly by Yadav's Algebra teacher, Amit Thakur, was that happiness multiplies by sharing positivity and so she must greet other students with a smile during the exams instead of avoiding them.Such Facebook-sourced seeds of wisdom are what Thakur-who covers five exam centres in Navi Mumbai on a bike before every paper-shares with his SSC students trusting that nature return the favour during the results. ""I have more faith in motivational than in god,"" says Thakur, whose students seek out his ""pravachans"" to escape the pre-exam drama of rustling books, pacing students, anxious parents and, as Yadav puts it, ""stereotypical teachers who ask us if we are prepared.""Thakur of Airoli's Sushiladevi Deshmukh Vidyalaya may not be stereotypical but his school-sanctioned motivational rounds are typical of a young trend fuelled by the pursuit of board exam success. In the bid to show they care, schools are showering meticulous checklists, mindfulness strategies and such keen personal touches that you'd be forgiven for mistaking the hall ticket for a business class pass.If Santacruz's R N Podar School held a yoga session for students 90 minutes before their first paper, Sangita Kukreti, principal ofVile Parle's Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School, spent five days last week phoning each of her 300 students to wish them luck. As a tradition, her school hands out sugar candy as prasad to each student, reminding you of a Gujarat exam centre that recently handed students welcome drinks and sprinkled flowers on them.Snigdha Roy, principal of Vashi's Father Agnel school, calls them 'feel-good'' gestures. ""They make students feel confident,"" says Roy, whose school distributed a pre-exam 'shopping list' that comprised, among other things, 20 chocolates. ""One to be eaten on each day of the exam period,"" says Roy, like a doctor prescribing a dosage. This list even advises students to ''change the watch battery"", ""carry an extra set of glasses"" and ""visit the dentist"". The last one should come in handy for another reason. ""On the last day, we treat all the students to ice-cream,"" says Roy.In fact, till two years ago, Roy's school used to drop children at their centre in school buses but they stopped as ""centres are too scattered now,"" says Roy. A teacher's presence at the centre has hidden perks. Years ago, history teacher Shobha Ramana, rushed a nervous student, who had ended up at the wrong centre, to the right venue in her car. ""I'd forgotten about this but she still remembers,"" says Ramana, about the ex-student.Younger schools are more eager to please. ""They are nervous,"" says CBSE student Ritika Mukherjee about her three-year-old Thane school, New Horizon, whose vice-principal showed up at the exam centre to hand out chocolate bars before the Hindi paper. ""It defused our tension,"" says Mukherjee, who tucked the bar into her bag and bit into it after the exam.Technology too comes to the rescue. With the help of a system called RFID (radio frequency identification)-the use of radio waves to read information stored on a tag attached to student identity cards-Shobhana Nandakumar, principal of Dombivli's The South Indian Association (SIA) High School, sends a good luck SMS to 200 board exam attendees via their parents' phones. ""Even parents feel reassured that we care,"" she says. Besides, through an app called Fliplearn, where teachers connect with students in real-time, these students receive proverbs like: 'Think high and you will raise high' and 'Do the best you can until you know better'. ""We even upload photos of toppers on our facebook page,"" says Nandakumar.Sometimes, higher forces than social media are invoked. To seduce lady luck, who sits somewhere between prayer and practice. Some high-end schools invite experts on Buddhist chanting and Vipassana meditation to prep minds. In the backdrop, school counsellors ease mental traffic. Recently, SIA's school counsellor Swati Parab formed a support group of ten slacking students who called themselves 'Rising Stars'. ""What if we go blank in the exam hall?"" they asked Parab, who dismissed the fear by comparing the brain to Google. ""If you search calmly, the answers will come sooner or later,"" says Parab, who also choregoraphed their dreams when she asked them to ""visualise yourself writing each paper well, 15 days before the exams"".Part cheerleader, part life-coach, their tactics may seem hippy-dippy-at least one student said a yoga session before the exam wasn't calming-but schools say they help. ""I get grateful SMSes from students,"" says Thakur, who believes attention is the best way to show you care. Sometimes it could come from unlikely sources. SSC student Jayalakshmi Iyer of Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandir Trust, lit up at an unprecedented sight before her exam. ""The security guards smiled and said good morning,"" she says."

The insects developed in the lab include dragon fly, spider, trichogramma brasiliensis, isotima jevenesis, coccinellide, syrphid, carabid, predatory pentatomids and abnthrocoriddbugs, he said.Khalsa College agriculture head Ramandeep Kaur Bal said there was a largesca le trend of using insecticides and pesticides among farmers. ""But by controlling the pests biologically, farmers will not only save money on costly and poisonous substances, but will also produce healthier crops in a natural manner,"" she said.Bal said the logic was that friendly pests feed on enemy insects and scare them away too to protect the plant. Khalsa College Governing Council secretary Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, who came up with the idea behind the project, said many sugar mills and farmers had already approached them for taking regular services of their bio-control lab to protect crops from harmful insects.To begin with, he said, the college's agriculture department would be growing crops on 50 acres without the use of insecticide and pesticides. ""The college will also hold farmers' meetings to raise awareness about the dangers of using chemicals.Also, we are going to expand our research in the lab,"" he said."

Hande is suspected of having killed his family and then himself early on Sunday. The Handes, who were originally from Vankute village in Sangamner taluka of Ahmednagar district, were staying in Telco colony for more than two decades, police said.While a suicide note found in the house did not reveal much about why Hande took the extreme step, the police believe he was frustrated with life.The family lived in one of the flats of a ground-plus-two-story apartment which Hande and his co-owned. Swati ran a beauty parlour at Dattanagar near their house, which was doing good business. Tejas was a tenth standard student of a prominent school located at Sadashiv Peth while Vaishnavi was in the fifth standard at an international school on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass.The incident came to light around 10am when a neighbour checked on them after being told by the milkman that their milk bag was lying unattended outside the flat.Senior police officers, including assistant commissioner of police Shivaji Pawar and senior inspector Vijaysinh Gaikwad, visited the spot.Pawar told TOI, ""We have recovered a single page, five-line suicide note from the clothes Hande was wearing. The note mentioned that it was written at 5am on Sunday. We suspect Hande killed his wife and daughters while they were asleep.""Gaikwad said the note purportedly written by Hande is addressed to his parents, uncles and aunts. It states, ""We were destined to live only this much. No one is responsible for our act.""A diary, which Hande would use for noting down daily expenses, was also recovered from the house, police said. ""What we could gather from it is that Hande owed Rs 64,000 to his friends and well-wishers. The loan amounts varied between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000. However, this loan does not seem to be the cause for the murders and suicide,"" Gaikwad said.Police investigators said a Rs 100 note was found clenched in the fist of each deceased person and they had a 'tilak' (kumkum) on their foreheads.Hande's brother lives in another half of the building on the first floor. The ground floor and second floor accommodation have been given out on rent.""On Sunday, Hande's nephew visited his flat but got no response. The milk bag and newspapers were lying outside the door. Soon after, Hande's brother and the other residents broke the glass window of the flat and saw Hande hanging from the ceiling fan. They called the police who broke open the door,"" Gaikwad said.Hande's neighbour, Ganesh Dhere, said he was a good man who stayed away from trouble. ""He loved his daughters and was happy. I met him on Saturday evening and he did not look troubled or tense to me. The daughters were good in studies and the older one was preparing hard for her board examinations,"" he said."

Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao inspected the village on Friday in what was seen as the first move to prepare for the game.Located 18 kilometres away, Alanganallur is where Madurai district's green blanket starts as the Madurai roads make way for lush paddy fields and sugarcane. Even five years ago, almost every house in this town had a game bull, if not a cow. ""Even people who were not economically well off had a cow which would help them tide over tough times,"" said Pandian, a villager. After the ban was imposed on jallikattu three years ago, many homes found it difficult to maintain the bulls, which were given away or sold off.""Even last year, many people gave the bulls to a gosala in Coimbatore which came forward to take good care of the animals,"" he said.Now with the protests gaining momentum and success very much on the cards, many bull owners are elated. G Renuka Eawari, who has two game bulls, says her 'champions' are ready to enter the arena even on Saturday.""We maintain them well throughout the year and they are ready to show their talent at the word go. We give them special diets every day as the most healthy among the calves are always picked up,"" she said. Hers is a family which has been maintaining game bulls for years. ""I am waiting for the green signal"" she said.The people of the village say they would definitely have to comply with some rules like covering the ground with coconut husk, constructing bamboo barricades and setting up gallery. Kumaran, a villager, says that they are ready to work through the night to construct the barricades and help the district administration with all the work if the game gets the nod.Meanwhile, P Rajasekhar, president of Jallikattu Paadukaapu Peravai, says that bulls and bull tamers are ready even if the game is to be conducted at 10 places simultaneously. But the preparations would take a minimum of one or two days.""We also do not know what guidelines are going to be issued along with the ordinance,'' he said. Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao said that they were fully prepared to act as per the instructions of the govt at any time."
58f6df5c7be9e031f13bd430,Varanasi appeals to stomach and soul,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/varanasi-appeals-to-stomach-soul/articleshow/57712478.cms,2017-03-19,"Every year Varanasi plays host to thousands of tourists hoping to discover their spiritual side. That has been the temple town's calling card and commerce. But foodies know that Varanasi's crowded streets and bylanes are also avenues of gastronomic delights. Many famous hawkers appear with their pushcarts in the evening. Some don't even have a signboard. Hygiene isn't their forte. But their offerings -- golgappas, rasedar pakoras, lassi - are addictive and available at a price that would buy you only a snigger in a city like Delhi.Quality street food, to anybody who pursues it like an obsessive lover, isn't just about feeling good. The best snacks take you into an unchartered zone where the taste buds groan with delight. It's like discovering an unknown erogenous zone. In their own way, the street-side hawkers of Varanasi are everyday artists in the business of producing and peddling pleasure.You might get that kind of feeling wolfing down Lalman's golgappas, or paani puris, sold from a handcart in a bylane near Lahurabir Chowk. What makes them irresistible isn't the tangy tamarind water but the filling, a slushy mix of chickpea, boiled potato and spices. He also serves a sweet version of the snack that feels almost like a dessert. Like most golgappa sellers in the city, the stuff he serves is customized to the amount of spicy heat your tastebuds can handle. Varanasi is a city of paan eaters. A long-lasting love affair with the paan makes a tongue hypersensitive to spice. This is primarily due to the use of chuna (lime), an essential ingredient for paan; hence the adjustment.Like Lalman, there are several other artistes of the palate strewn across the city, which is now Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Lok Sabha constituency. One of the go-to places for breakfast is the late Chhanni Devi's, who sold puri-sabji and jalebis from a rundown shop in Lanka area, near BHU. Popularly known as ""Chachi"", she showered abuse on customers asking her to hurry up; the customers, in turn, were addicted to her rantings.Among the famous who graced the place was superstar Rajesh Khanna. The sabji served with the puri is made of pumpkin, potatoes and black gram. There is a rhythm with which her son Kailash Yadav flattens and shapes the dough before it is deep-fried, twice. The shop opens at 3.30 am. ""We start serving jalebis by 5 am and puri-sabji by 6. By 11.30 am, we are through,"" he says. A plate of four puris and sabji costs Rs 24.Adjacent are three shops selling lassi, all run by sons of Panna Sardar who ran the legendary original Pehalwan lassi. This is the third generation in the business. Lassis, with a dash of malai and saffron on top, are sold in clay cups. Some are so thick you almost need to chew.A kulhar (clay cup) of lassi is about beauty in minimalism. No frills; just the best of natural ingredients: curd made of buffalo milk, sugar and a hint of rosewater or saffron. It's part of the city's living heritage, created and consumed every day, sustained by a commitment to tradition. Places like these created a popular expression called 'Lanketing', going specifically to Lanka for snacks.Then there's Pappu's, the legendary tea stall in Assi mohalla that serves milk and lemon tea. The political gyan is free. The lemon tea here is flavoured with Hajmola, giving it a distinct whiff of heeng (asafoetida).There's much more. Near Lahurabir Chowk stands Jwala Prasad 's push cart selling rasedar pakora made of gram flour (besan), spinach and spices. The three are kneaded into a ball, deep fried and dipped in a fiery curry. Then it's served with a sprinkling of sohal, a salty savoury. The pakoras have two variations: sada and rangeen. The rangeen version is stuffed with bhang, a popular intoxicant generally laced with sweets.At Chetganj, Umashankar Sahu's family has been selling kachoris for three generations. As a peddler, Sahu has the smallest of stands where he keeps the kachoris, a little larger than a Rs 10 coin, garnished with shredded radish and carrot, and served with tamarind chutney.Varanasi is also famous for its sweets to which the city's Bengalis have also made a singular contribution. Shops with signs of desi and Bengali mithai can be seen. Some shops located around Pucca Mohal area along the ghats, sell their stuff only between 7 pm to 2 am. On offer are sweets suggestively named: Palangtod (Bed-breaker) and Malaipuri.One has deliberately avoided referring to the iconic Kashi and Deena Chat Bhandars at Godowlia Chowk which are more established joints. Crowds, including tourists, throng to Deena for a taste of their tamatar chaat, a rather unique snack which uses tomatoes ingeniously and which is eaten out of kullars. In the winter, chura matar, dripping with desi ghee, is the rage.Sometimes one wonders why food doesn't figure in the narrative of the holy city. Is it because it is primarily a business of yadavs and baniyas, who don't figure high in the city's intellectual story? There is no simple answer.What one does know is that there is a self-confidence to Varanasi; the way it looks at life, culture, and itself. The eternal city seems to stand a little above everything it surveys. There is a rhythm to its existence that's yet unspoiled by the ravages of time. And food is an inseparable part of it."

He also unveiled populist promises such as farm loan waivers and laptops with free data. Free education for girls up to graduation and for boys up to Class XII have also been promised.Shah also said a BJP government in the state would be willing to implead itself in the ongoing litigation on triple talaq in the Supreme Court after ascertaining the opinion of Muslim women  a pledge intended to agitate UP's political fault-lines. Ram mandir aur vikas saath-saath chal sakte hain,"" Shah said. While the reference is unchanged from the 2014 BJP Lok Sabha polls manifesto, the emphasis is significant in the context of UP's polarised politics even as Shah made it clear that he was referring to speeding up ongoing legal proceedings in the case. The manifesto calls for ""exploring all possibilities within the Constitutional framework in construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya"".The manifesto also focuses on issues BJP has been raising - law and order, corruption, illegal mining and the menace of politically sponsored land grabbing and promises separate task forces on all three areas.Countering the suggestion that BJP has borrowed from Samajwadi Party programmes, Shah said the distribution of laptops will not be guided by community interests and that the party has added the promise of 1GB free data. But BJP also seemed keen to shore up its flanks against populist themes such as loan waivers and clearance of sugar cane dues promised by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.By referring to the ongoing court process, Shah seemed to be hinting that BJP will await for the court's decision instead of considering measures such as a Bill for the construction of Ram Temple as demanded by seers and VHP leaders.Not mentioning Kairana in west UP directly, where BJP MP Hukum Singh created a storm by raising the issue of exodus of Hindus fearing violence at the hands of Muslims, the manifesto promises to make district magistrates and superintendents of police responsible, apart from setting up a special department in the government.The manifesto reads: ""To stop exodus due to communal tension, a special department would be created and in each district, especially West UP, a deputy collector would be appointed.""Speaking on the issue of triple talaq, Shah said: ""The issue is pending in court. However, once BJP comes to power, the state government would take opinion of Muslim women on the issue and, if need be, would become a party in the ongoing case, presenting the opinion of the Muslim women from the state.""On law and order front, the manifesto promises to put all criminals, who are absconding after 'been given parole, behind bars within 45 days if BJP government is formed in the state. To check corruption, the manifesto promises a special helpline in the CM's office (CMO) while the task force too will be directly under the CMO.While promising loan waiver to UP farmers, the manifesto made a special mention of plight of sugarcane farmers, promising to clear due to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore within three months. ""Farmers will be provided post-dated cheques, which can be encashed 14 days after sale of cane,"" said Shah.The manifesto promises a start-up venture capital fund worth Rs 1,000 crore to ""encourage youth to be self reliant"". Every college and university will get free wi-fi facility and 10 new international level universities will be set up, the manifesto said, also promising a Rs 500-crore Baba Saheb Ambedkar scholarship fund for poor students pursuing higher studies. With a special focus on SCs and STs, the manifesto promises 25 special courts to expedite cases under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.On the power front, BJP promises to provide subsidised electricity to the poor for the first hundred units, the rebate being Rs 3 per unit.Focussing on the two underprivileged regions of UP - Bundelkhand and Purvanchal -- the manifesto promises two ""development boards"". A road corridor connecting Mathura-Varanasi-Jhansi-Gorakhpur has been promised, while a helicopter service to connect tourist and pilgrimage centres has been added.The manifesto promises filling up of a staggering 1.5 lakh vacancies in the police department, ""keeping merit as its basis and without any discrimination on the basis of caste or religion"". ""This will end politicisation of the police force,"" said Shah. It also promised scrapping of the interview process for posts in grade 3 and 4."

She generally hangs around hutments opposite Tipu Sultan mosque. At Gariahat market, 'Komorbhanga' Bikash (name changed) runs the show. From an average grocer to the parking attendant, everyone knows him. He does not sit at his regular spot - a stool beside a shop selling dairy products - in the morning but is available till the early hours of morning from 5pm.At Wood Street and Short Street, there are groups who hang around in the area targeting students from elite schools in Park Street, Loudon Street, Moira Street and Rowdon Street. ""They do not approach students but there are a group of students who are regular buyers and they introduce others to them,"" said a Class XII student. Metiabruz, Garden Reach and red-light areas at Sonagachhi and Kalighat also serve as popular markets.The consumersThe consumers are mostly young students who get to know about the peddlers from peer groups. Outside prominent schools, the peddlers don't respond to random buyers unless they are accompanied by a regular customer. Once a known face, the peddlers even call or whatsapp the students the photographs and price of the new stuff as and when they arrive.Most of the transaction takes place when the school gets over and there are several people - guardians, pool car drivers, hawkers - of different age groups outside the school gates, a perfect camouflage for the peddlers.Police inactionCops are well aware about the business but stay mum. Since most of the operatives are women, cops claim they can't search them in absence of women cops. The peddlers, however, say police get a share at every level and so they look the other way. At Sealdah, Chandni (name changed) assures customers that they need to ""pay only Rs 20 to police"" if they get caught. She pays a constable Rs 30 every day. Officers get Rs 500 every week. However, the officers have their alibis ready. ""There is not much of organized network for cannabis in Kolkata. The city serves as a transit point,"" said Subrata Biswas, Collector (Excise) Kolkata."

The value of the seized packets is around Rs 1.08 lakh.The packets (wheat, roasted chickpeas and sugar) were manufactured and packed by Shakala Mahila Mandal in Gala 1, Mahavir Industrial Estate, Valiv, Vasai (E) under the state women and child development department. Each packet containing 140gm is given to mothers to prepare porridge (using milk or water) and feed child four-five times a day. Each packet contains 500 calories of energy and 12-15gm protein. There are 88,272 anganwadis under the scheme and over 86 lakh children are covered under it, according to the 2001 census.Workers allegedly tampered with expiry dates and batch numbers, using paint thinners. ""We have seized the packets and sent them to the laboratory for testing. We will take action based on the report,"" said food safety officer Rahul Takate. He said that while it was premature to say if the quality of food had been compromised with, workers were seen wiping batch numbers and putting fresh stamps.Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) staffers had gone to the industrial estate to collect house tax when they noticed this. Milind Patil, a staffer and eyewitness, said, ""We got suspicious on finding the gala shutter down. We saw workers using paint thinners to wipe out expiry dates on food packets."" He said a number of packets had December expiry dates. The workers were using rubber stamps of January 2017 on the packets.

The Centre is levying the cess, collected as an excise duty, of Rs 124 per quintal on the sweetener produced by any factory in the country. It was raised substantially from Rs 24 per quintal only last year. The cess, collected from sugar mills, is deposited in Sugar Development Fund (SDF) managed by the food ministry. The fund is used to lend money to mills at lower interest rates.According to sources, various kinds of cess and surcharges are levied on goods and services. The finance ministry wants to subsume some cesses under GST, which is why it has proposed to do away with the sugar cess under SDF. Some cesses would continue as funds collected will be used to compensate states for any losses incurred after GST is rolled out, the sources added. Meanwhile, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has written to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to consider transfer of Rs 2,880 crore expected to be collected as sugar cess during 2016-17 in SDF. Paswan has also suggested that budgetary allocation be made to SDF in the event of abolition of sugar cess which is an important funding source for running subsidised programmes for mills.SDF was set up in 1982 to provide financial help for development of sugar industry. Since inception, about Rs 7,500 crore has been disbursed to sugar factories.The food ministry has further sanctioned SDF loans of Rs 865 crore for disbursement in 2016-17 and 2017-18. In recent years, SDF has been used to finance various interventions of the government to deal with the crisis in the sugar industry.The country's sugar production is estimated to be lower at 22.5 million tonnes in the 2016-17 marketing year (October-September), as against 25.1 million tonnes last year.

With just two days to go for the festival, bustling shopping destinations like Poomarket and Ramanathapuram still wore a deserted look. The situation is more pronounced in rural areas, where many farmers prefer a low-key celebration just to maintain the traditions.While large stocks of Poolaippoo, Avarampoo and sugarcane arrived at Poomarket on Mettupalayam Road through Wednesday night and Thursday morning, the number of shoppers remained thin. Many shopkeepers were in downbeat even as stocks brought all the way from Anaikatti, Mettupalayam and Dharmapuri were being unloaded.""I brought five tonnes of sugarcane on Tuesday to set up shop here,"" said G Govindarajan from Dharmapuri. ""But only half a tonne has been sold till Thursday,"" Govindarajan said. Though he is charging Rs 100 for two sticks, he is willing to reduce the price to Rs 70 for four sticks. ""It is a very average year in terms of business,"" said another sugarcane dealer, G Murugesh. Turmeric stocks, required for Kaapu Katu, from Erode were yet to arrive.The situation is same with the sales of flowers and clay pots. ""Business during Pongal is down by at least 50% this year,"" says the owner of Prabhakaran Flower Stall on the road.""Despite us charging only Rs 5 for a roll of Avarampoo and Rs 10 for a roll of Poolaipoo, almost Rs 4 lesser than last year, we are left with unsold stocks. I brought 50 rolls last night, and I'm still left with 25 rolls of Avarampoo and five rolls of Poolaipoo,"" says Rathina Raja, who brought in stocks from Mettupalayam. ""I was expecting to bring fresh stocks by Thursday evening, if everything got sold out,"" she says.A group of women from Anaikatti say they usually make around Rs 6,000 by the day before Bhogi, but their earnings have hardly crossed Rs 2,000 as off Thursday afternoon.The shop-keepers say the difference is more marked in rural areas and farming belts. ""In Mettupalayam, it looks like people have not begun their Pongal celebrations,"" says Raja.Farmers say they can't be blamed in the current situation. ""Honestly, I have nothing much to harvest. I will be surprised if I get back the money I have invested,"" says T Sampath, a banana farmer from Karamadai. ""I am going to incur loss.

The retail prices of loose sugar has increased by Rs 8 per kg in the past one year and by at least Rs 2 a kg in the past one month. Increase in prices of sugar has become a matter of concern for the government just before the state polls in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab Sources said food ministry has informally told representatives of sugar industry body, ISMA not to exploit the sentiment of low production of sugar this year to make a killing. ""We can assess the cost of production and whether they are artificially pushing the retail prices. This won't be allowed at any cost,"" afood ministry official said. Sugar production this year is estimated at 22.5 million tonnes, which is the least in the past five years. Sources said the government has an action plan ready to rein in prices if necessary. But this will be rolled out once the production of sugar for this year is re-assessed.

Though there is a scope for bettering the state balance sheet, its fiscal situation is not as bad as some states, the chamber said.The top priority of the new government should be to drastically improve the quality and quantity of power supply in the ensuing summer. Like several parts of the country, the challenge is not as much generation and availability of power but the financial health of the power utilities, mostly in the state ownership.The new government should immediately take recourse to the UDAY scheme of the Centre and bring the state utility to robust health so that the users in both rural and urban areas are given better power supply. As is provided in the new scheme of things, fresh investment should be made in separate supply channels to the farmers who, for welfare reasons, have to be given the electricity supply at the concessional rates and the financial load can be taken by the state government, rather than the individual power utility.""Being an agricultural state, Uttar Pradesh has a huge potential in diverse agro activities like live stock, milk production and processing, food processing . For instance, abundant supply of potatoes in districts like Kannauj and mango in areas like Maliabad, need a modern processing facilities which should be encouraged in the private sector by way of fiscal and other support. Likewise, lot more agro hubs and mandis should be built in the state,"" ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat said.As of now, the state produces about 360-400 lakh tonnes per annum and is the number one producer of milk in the country.The state has several large sized cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad, Noida, Agra, Meerut, Moradabad, Meerut which need to be modernized and upgraded in terms of infrastructure. While initiatives like metro rail have been taken, they must be enlarged and lot more investment be made in city infrastructure including sanitation, drinking water, urban waste management.""A drive down the state presents a bad picture of heaps of plastics not only in cities but also in villages, creating an environment hazards, including the ground water,"" the chamber said. Since the same BJP is now in power in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, a better coordination should be achieved between the two states to give a better deal to the Bundelkhand areas which have suffered for long due to water scarcity and general backwardness."
58f6e5f77be9e031f13bdb04,Muslim voters hold the key to Rohilkhand title,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/muslim-voters-hold-the-key-to-rohilkhand-title/articleshow/57116491.cms,2017-02-13,"LUCKNOW: With seven out of 11 districts of Rohilkhand going to the polls in the second phase on February 15 having more than 30% Muslim population, it will be a real test for an aggressive minority outreach by both Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party. On the other hand, Bharatiya Janata Party, facing an anti-demonetization sentiments among voters, would be banking on a split in minority votes as a consolidation may spell trouble for it in this phase.Rohilkhand has always been dominated by Muslims and a number of constituencies out of 67 foing to the polls in Phase 2 have more than 50^% population of the community. In districts like Rampur (50.6%), Moradabad (50.8%), Bijnor (43%) and Amroha (40.8%), the share of the community almost reaches the halfway mark. In 2012, when the Muslims voted en mass for SP, it won 35 out of 67 seats while BJP could win just 10. The BSP had 11 seats in this region and now if it has to return to power in Lucknow, it will have to consolidate its position among Muslims to form a winning caste chemistry of the Dalits and the Muslims.Both BSP and SP have started claiming support from Muslim clerics and ulema to send a message among the community voters that they are the best placed to defeat BJP. While Ulama Council, shia cleric Kalbe Jawad and Delhi Jama Masjid's Imam Maulana Bukhari pronounced their support for BSP, a large number of clerics and ulema, led by the principal of prominent seminary Nadwa-ul-Islam, Maulana Saeed-ur-Rahman Azami Nadwi and imam of Aisbagh Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali met CM Akhilesh Yadav and extended their support to him.For BJP, this region is most difficult to win as it faces the distraught workers of small-scale and unorganised trades and Muslims united against the party. With thousands of poor working in the zari , wooden furniture and flute-making industries in dark and dingy lanes and bylanes to make two ends meet on one side and farmers prospering from paddy, sugar cane wheat and milk production on the other, Rohilkhand region, going to polls in the second phase of voting for the 2017 assembly elections presents a picture of contrast.Demonetisation has, however, hit the haves as well as have-nots of the region. If a large part of the manpower is sitting idle in the unorganised sector and the furniture and zari cottage industries, lakhs of farmers are hit hard too as they are finding no buyers for their farm produce. ""We have no orders though the marriage season is at its peak,"" lamented Suresh Agarwal, owner of a cane furniture shop, recalling how he had to hire additional workers to deliver the orders of furniture in the previous season.Badaun district in this region is a spot of prosperity for the white revolution being largest producer of milk in the region, while in Bareilly , Pilibhit, Saharanpur, Lakhimpur and Shahjahanpur, the impact of green revolution has over the decades changed the socio-economic condition. A good number of Sikh families of Lakhimpur and parts of Shahjahanpur have siblings in the US and Canada. The farm houses and resorts in this terai belt of the state have best of electronic gadgets and cars in their possession. More than two-third of 120 sugar mills are in this part and with highest production of sugar cane and paddy it is also called the rice bowl and sugar belt.But delving deeper, the economic condition of those making a livelihood out of zari work and kajal (kohl) manufacture has not improved in the past 40-50 years and they are still dependent on daily wages. This is the reason petty workers in the unorganised sector of Rohilkhand are worst hit by the demonetisation.For the ruling Samajwadi Party too, the challenge is to protect its citadel. The party has now allied with the Congress which won just three seats. The prestige of Dharmendra Yadav, Samajwadi Party MP from Badaun and cousin of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is at stake in the region. Like in many places, the ruling party is facing stiff resistance from rebels.Captain Arjun Singh , who was well placed in US and a professional pilot was roped in by Akhilesh Yadav to join his party and contest election. But he was denied ticket because his father Narendra Yadav is a Mulayam loyalist. Now, Arjun Singh is contesting from the Dataganj assembly constituency independently and challenging the SP-Congress alliance.After Badaun, the party's prestige is at stake in Rampur a district represented by powerful minister Mohammed Azam Khan who is contesting this time along with his son, while Azam's wife is already a Rajya Sabha member. Azam is so tied up in his home district for his and his son's elections that even so close to the third phase of polls he has not yet stepped out of his home to campaign for other candidates of the party.Across Rohilkhand, the Congress hopes hinge on its firebrand leader Imran Masood of Saharanpur. Masood has worked hard in the district and adjoining constituencies and Congress had gave him free hand in ticket distribution. Former Union minister Jitin Prasada is also contesting from Tilhar assembly while the sitting MLA of the party Sanjay Kapoor is seeking his re-election."

However, people in rural areas are still reeling under the problem as currency chests are not supplying enough money to rural branches of banks. This, despite the RBI's instructions to ensure 40 per cent of new notes should be supplied to rural areas.In the remonetisation move, the RBI infused over Rs 6 lakh crore in new denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 of which Karnataka's share is nearly Rs 90,000 crore. Central bank officials said this was the main reason for serpentine queues vanishing from ATMs and hoped the situation would further improve.The infusion of money into the system, however, is yet to change life in rural areas as many banks maintaining currency chests failed in equitable distribution. ""When we saw that banknotes being supplied to rural areas are not commensurate with the demand, some steps are being initiated. We're trying to ensure that at least 40% notes are supplied to rural branches of Regional Rural Banks, District Co-operative Centrals Banks and commercial banks,"" said a recent RBI notification.The RBI asked banks to issue more notes in denominations of Rs 500 and less to ATMs. ""The existing stock of other denomination notes below Rs 100 should be issued liberally,"" the notification added.Farmers' leaders said the RBI advisory has not helped.While farmers are entitled to withdraw Rs 24,000 from their bank accounts every week, they're not getting even a quarter of the limit, said Kuruburu Shantha Kumar, president, All-India Sugarcane Growers' Association. deposited a cheque of Rs 1.5 lakh into his account in an RRB in Beechanahalli after selling his crop. He wanted to withdraw Rs 20,000 to pay a borewell agency , but the bank allowed him to withdraw just Rs 3,000. Elsewhere, a Gadag farmer, who received Rs 2 lakh by cheque for his maize crop, wanted to withdraw Rs 10,000 from his account. He was given only Rs 2,000.""While the cash crunch has caused many problems, the main concern is about the rural economy being impacted badly . Earlier, farmers did not get crop loans because of demonetization.Now, they're not getting their own money even after the so-called demonetization,"" said Shantha Kumar.The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) took note of the issue.""The currency chests have to comply with RBI instructions and prioritize distribution of currency to rural branches of banks,"" said M I Ganagi, chief general manager, Nabard.""We've asked RRBs and DCCBs to report regularly on the cash situation. We're getting continuous feedback from all corners, and the situation is improving slowly ,"" Ganagi added.Farmers' organisations are together taking up the issue and their leaders will meet the Karnataka governor and RBI regional director on January 14. An official in the State-Level Bankers' Committee said a meeting would be convened to take stock of the situation."

This year, however, they say that cash crunch caused by demonetisation has adversely affected the sales.With the festival, also known 'dahi-chura' day, only a few days away, many shops selling sesame products like 'tilkut', 'tilpapdi', 'til laddoo', 'rewadi' and 'til gajak' have come up in the city. Several old sweet shops of Patna have also hired 'tilkut' makers to make the delicacies so as to sell them from their shops.""A week or so ahead of the Sankranti till last year, my shop used to be chock-a-block with 'tilkut' buyers. This year, however, you can see for yourself we are virtually sitting idle. The sales have dropped by almost 30%,"" said Basant Kumar who runs a sweet shop opposite the Patna Museum.Pramod Kumar, who is the manager at Basant's shop, attributes the poor sales to, apart from demonetisation, the fact that makeshift 'tilkut' shops have mushroomed in the state capital. ""Till, say, five years back, there were few shops around. But now 'tilkut' is selling at every nook and corner of the city. Many sellers have reduced the price at the cost of quality. Though our old patrons come to us, many go for cheaper options,"" he said on Monday.Binay Kumar Gupta, who has been selling 'tilkut' on Boring Road for 32 years, also complains of fall in demand. ""I am into 'tilkut' trade only for two months in the winter. The rest of the year I run a general store to earn a living,"" he said and recalled he would sell at least 35 to 40kg of 'tilkut' every day on the eight-ten days in the run-up to January 14, but he was not seling more than 20kg every day this time.Gupta had feared cash crunch would hit the sales. That's why he applied to a bank for a swipe (point of sale) machine soon after the demonetisation was announced on November 8 last year. Almost two months on, he has not been issued the machine and, as such, he has to return the customers who want to make payments through credit or debit cards.'Tilkut' made of jaggery is more in demand than that made of sugar, according to Gupta. At his shop, tilkut was selling at Rs 260-320/kg while the 'khowa' stuff was priced at Rs 380/kg. 'Tilkut' stuffed with dry fruits were also seeling at Gupta's shop at Rs 600/kg."

It is probably the high time that the Centre levied additional taxes on foods with added sugar and salt and saturated fats, despite the objections to such a move. A group of secretaries has submitted a proposal to the Prime Minister on this, and recommended that the additional revenue be diverted to the health budget.Awareness crucialDirector General of the Indian Council of Medical Research Soumya Swaminathan said that these foods were partly responsible for the non-communicable diseases in the country. But additional tax alone wouldnt solve the problem  awareness was also crucial, as were other factors. This experiment in other countries has shown positive results, she said. City-based experts say the proposal, if accepted, could have a positive impact on public health. V. Mohan, chairman, Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialties Centre, explained: Sugar is known to have a direct link with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The impact of cutting down on sugar can be seen on weight in months, especially in children. It also has an effect on pre-diabetics  eliminating sugar can help prevent those with pre-diabetes from progressing to diabetes, he said.Shocking figuresDr. Mohan said that Tamil Nadu has around 3.5 million people with diabetes and about 3 million who are pre-diabetic. A study by his centre in Chennai some years ago on 25,000 school-going children had revealed that over 25 per cent of those in private schools and over eight per cent of those in government schools were either overweight or obese.A tax on sugared drinks will increase their price and act as a deterrent to the public  and it has been shown to work in the case of tobacco, said Madhan Kumar, president, Indian Association of Public Health Dentistry.But it would only be useful with education on the ill effects of sugar on health, he said. Sucrose, he said, is proven to have a role in the formation of dental caries and in gum disease.The Indian population consumes twice or even three times the World Health Organisations permissible limit of salt intake a day, which is five grams, said Rajan Ravichandran, director, MIOT Institute of Nephrology. A study in Tamil Nadu five years ago showed over 30 per cent of adults and 5 per cent of school children had hypertension, he said, adding that the tax would be a good move, but that food variants with lower salt levels and tax rebates should also be made available. Salt consumption is directly linked to hypertension which is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease, he said. Obesity, diabetes and hypertension are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, said K. Kannan, Head of Cardiology at Government Stanley Hospital. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease in Tamil Nadu is between 11 and 12 per cent in the adult population, he said."

Dr. Hemant Gupta, consultant at Bombay Hospital, says one should have enough sugar, salt and water in the body. Sip juices and eat sweets intermittently. Even diabetic patients should be liberal in eating sweets during summer. If possible, avoid stepping out between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m., and do not over-exercise.Dr. Gupta says in a busy city like Mumbai one can become easily irritable and theres a risk of fainting and getting convulsions. So, consume more salty foods like papads, fryums and pickle.Dr. Anand Purohit, a Borivali-based general physician, emphasises on the need for adequate sleep. Lack of sleep may trigger a vicious cycle leading to insomnia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Dr. Purohit added, Eat food thats rich in nutrients and fibres like fruits, which will nourish the body.

And, in northern Kerala, kidney stone is becoming a major health concern among workers in the Gulf.V.G. Pradeep Kumar, president, Kerala chapter, Indian Medical Association, said that over 80% of kidney diseases in the State were induced by hypertension and high blood sugar.Lifestyle changes are the main villain. The IMA has been running campaigns to create awareness on the issue. Many government hospitals now have lifestyle clinics which are addressing it, Dr. Kumar said.According to a study, around 30% of adults in Kerala are diabetic and 16% have high blood pressure. M. Thomas Mathew, former professor at Kozhikode Medical College, who is now senior consultant nephrologist at Baby Memorial Hospital here, said that those with high cholesterol levels too were at a higher risk of developing kidney diseases. The number of diabetic patients is more in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts, he said.Kidney stone is another common problem found among the labourers who return from Gulf countries. It is caused by the extreme weather conditions in those countries and the contaminated water they consume. They use a lot of tomato in their food, like tomato juice and sauces. This leads to calcium deposits and later kidney stones, Dr. Mathew said.Focus on lifestyleHe said that increased focus on lifestyle changes would help prevent these problems.Regular health check-ups and screening blood and urine tests are a must. Smoking and alcohol consumption should be avoided. Control of diet, blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol and regular physical exercise will help, he said.Theme for the yearTo highlight these risks and to mark World Kidney Day, hospitals such as Baby Memorial Hospital and organisations such as the IMA are holding screening and awareness camps in the city on Thursday.

It crushed me. Today, Im super stoked to be on the same list as her, and not because of the way I look, posted Pooja Dhingra on her Instagram page, when she was featured on a list of 19 inspirational women in the country.In an interview about her latest book, The Wholesome Kitchen , the 31-year-old pastry chef and businesswoman recounts her journey to rediscover a healthy lifestyle, while indulging in the good things that life has to offer  like a guilt-free red velvet brownie. Whos going to say no to that?The Big Book of Treats was full of decadence, and The Wholesome Kitchen is all about mindful eating. Which one do you relate to more?Baking has been a passion since childhood. The many years Ive spent in the pastry kitchen haven given me so much joy and satisfaction. Fitness and exercise too has been a constant source of strength. Dance, yoga and running a half marathon have all led up to this moment in my life, where I am experimenting with healthy ingredients and mindful eating. As contrasting as it sounds, I completely relate to both.What made you write The Wholesome Kitchen ?The last few years Ive been incredibly focussed on my health. My love for desserts and all things sweet, conversations with friends (and now contributors for the book) led to experiments with different ingredients, cooking without sugar, and eventually, The Wholesome Kitchen .What was Viddhi Dhingras input to the book?Viddhi came on board as a professional nutritionist and played a vital role in helping me devise recipes with specific fitness goals. Her input was important on each recipe, to make sure it was as nutritionally balanced as tasty.Energise, Nourish, Refresh and Indulge: could you explain why the book was split into these particular sections?The categorisation is based both on each dishs nutritional value, and on how you will feel when you eat or drink it. So you might choose to have a bowl of crunchy granola from the Energise section for breakfast or snack. Similarly, a Nourish recipe might be a great option for lunch. Lemon loaf, in the Refresh section, works well both as a dessert or as a side to your cup of coffee. Indulge is, well, all about indulging yourself any time of day.What would you tell people who use lack of time as an excuse for not eating healthy?Being healthy requires effort. Planning is everything when it comes to making healthy choices.The book has several recipes that arent time-consuming and can be easily carried as healthy snacks. Spend a little time on the weekend and make a healthy meal plan that is also one you look forward to. This motivates me.What are your favourite healthy ingredients?Coconut oil, almonds and dark chocolate.Would you recommend indigenous ingredients over imported ones? Why?Imported goods are often expensive and hard to find on a regular basis. When choosing a healthy lifestyle, make sure that its sustainable. So, as far as possible, I recommend buying ingredients found locally."

But migrant workers are cooking their way into peoples hearts even beyond hotels and restaurants.Many a roadside eatery has the migrants lending their touch to give dishes from the north their innate flavour.Chaat stalls on push carts, nearly all of them flaunting the same name board, whether at Karamana, Fort, Vazhuthacaud, or Technopark, are run by men from Chittor in Rajasthan. Raju sells chaat on the Poojappura-Karamana road, and Fateh Lal, aka Devraj, near a private hospital in the Fort area. They have been in the city for varying lengths of time. They had heard about Kerala from family and friends who had been here, and decided to head south in search of a better life. Though unmarried, they have families back home that are engaged in farming, an occupation with poor prospects, they say, owing to the lack of water.Life here is better, they say, because they can earn more, though working seven days a week does not leave much time for anything else. Their day starts early around 5 a.m., to make the puris for pani puri, a time-consuming process. By the time everything is done, it is well past noon. A short break later, it is time to open up shop. Vegetables are chopped once the stall opens, depending on the demand. Not that there is much left to take back home once it is closing time. Most days, whatever sev, puris, or puffed rice they bring is exhausted, letting them pocket a decent profit.From Tamil NaduR. Selvathurai, a Thenkasi native, sells nongu from his two-wheeler parked in front of the Police Training College at Thycaud. With a decade-and-half here behind him, Selvathurai greets many with easy familiarity. While the rest of his family resides back home, the few months he is here, Selvathurai lives at Kollengode. Once the rains hit the State, he packs off to Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu for some time, before heading home to Thenkasi to work as a labourer before returning to the city to coincide with the Sabarimala season.The sugar cane juice business also has a good number of migrant workers. Amit, who hails from a village around an hour from Guwahati in Assam, sells sugar cane juice on the Poojapppura-Karamana road. Not too far away, at the mouth of the Jagathy-Poojappura road, is Sherif, from Kolkata. Amit lives at Kaniyapuram with 16 others, all of them from Assam. He earns around Rs. 500 day, though the sugar cane press is not owned by him. Having been here six years, Sherif speaks Malayalam fluently.Unlike Amit though, he owns his sugar cane press, and saves enough for his family, which includes a pregnant wife, and to send money home. Here, I can save some money. Back home, the salary is less, and it just gets spent.Amit, who has studied till Class 3, says it is not impossible to make ends meet in Assam, but there is more money to be made here. I send Rs. 10,000-12,000 home each month."

She once even slept for five days at a stretch.It was impossible to wake her up even after an hour or two, when one would assume she had got enough sleep.Parents of the child, Liya, who was four years old, were left dazed by what they learnt. She was having sleep attacks that left her in deep sleep for hours, with some bouts lasting between 10-12 hours and even five days.In a desperate moment we tried shining a torch into her eyes, said Linu Denny, her mother. Nothing would wake her up; it was frightening, she said.The trips to hospitals started with the sleep attacks that began in October last year.What I found was that she was tremendously hungry before the attacks, said Linu. Hungry, irritable and crying.The doctors found high blood pressure and even high blood sugar in the child, but the heart rate was low, the mother said.Liyas developmental parameters did not follow a normal timeline. She had delayed speech and showed certain autistic features. Linu and her husband Denny Anthikkadan, a rice mill worker in Kanjoor, Kalady, had sought help earlier. She started speaking only when she turned three.Eight attacks so farThe girl has had eight sleep attacks since October. She was treated also for non-convulsive epileptic attacks earlier, and it was during one such episode that she was found to be bleeding from nose and mouth. The ESI hospital that was sending them to referral centres then sent her to Aster Medcity.Dr. Akbar Mohammed Chettali, paediatric neurologist treating the child, said it was a rare case of a sleeping disorder called Kleine-Levin syndrome or Sleeping Beauty syndrome. It is a rare neurological disorder with only around one or two cases per million, he said.A neuropsychiatric disorder, it had earlier been found in a few cases in small children who had autistic features. But no studies have linked it with autism, he added.A study was done using Polysomnography: recording brain waves, the oxygen level in blood, heart rate and breathing as well as eye and leg movements to diagnose sleep disorders. Consultations with other specialities followed, indicating prolonged REM (rapid eye movement, deep) sleep. Investigations through clinical criteria and diagnosis through exclusion pointed to Kleine-Levin syndrome, said Dr. Chettali. The child has responded to treatment.The sleep attacks are expected to come down with age, the doctor said."

58f94ae4a3d24b0b70c3ea3d,The groundwater beneath their feet,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-groundwater-beneath-their-feet/article17322966.ece,2017-02-18,"It is 7 a.m. in the morning. In Puliyankannu in Ranipet, in Vellore district in Tamil Nadu, Valliamma is busy preparing steaming cups of coffee and tea while a man sits next to her making masala vadai for the people milling around. When asked about the distinct chemical odour that surrounds the village, the 80-year-old woman shrugs nonchalantly. It comes and goes, she says. All the people in the village seem equally resigned to the polluted air they breathe even as they yearn for cleaner air and fresh groundwater, both of which are in short supply in this bustling industrial belt.The factorys tainted legacyAcross the village, on the side of the 730-acre State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT) Industrial Complex (phase I), lies what has changed the lives of hundreds of villagers in the last two decades. It is the abandoned compound of the Tamil Nadu Chromates and Chemicals Limited (TCCL). In its backyard is the source of the problem and it reaches out to the sky: 2.27 lakh tonnes of chromium-bearing solid waste from an area of two hectares. TCCL, before it shut operations in 1995, used to manufacture sodium dichromate, basic chromium sulphate and sodium sulphate.All this chromium was dumped two decades ago when the factory closed for reasons that are not clear. The huge heap of yellow-coloured chromium, about three to five metres high, is so toxic that it finds place in the List of Hazardous Waste Contaminated Dump Sites in the Country, compiled by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).With its tanneries and chemical units, Ranipet in 2006 earned the dubious distinction of being one of the 10 cities/districts/villages on New York-based Blacksmith Institutes list of worst polluted places in the world. Sadly, not much has changed in the decade since. Even now, during rains, leachate containing hexavalent chromium, a form of the metal that is more toxic to humans as it is carcinogenic, has been steadily flowing on the ground, with devastating effects. Widespread contamination of soil and groundwater, since 1995, is the factorys legacy.The abandoned factory is proof of the intensity of the contamination, as stagnant pools of rainwater have turned a dirty yellow. When I was young, the water in the Puliyankannu Eri used to be so clean and clear that I could see my face in it, Valliamma recalls. In the last 20 to 30 years, industrial pollution, especially from TCCL, has polluted the lake water and it has become unusable. Water in many wells is also contaminated. Nobody constructs borewells here as the groundwater is polluted.Scanning through the pages of a regional newspaper, Dhanalakshmi, another resident, remembers how she used to take clothes to the lake 30 years ago to wash them. Luckily, we get potable water from Thengal where the Ponnai and Palar rivers converge, she says. If water is one of the problems, air pollution is another. When there is wind, the smell of chemicals fills the air and we end up inhaling the polluted air. Many residents complain of frequent cold and respiratory illnesses.A few metres away from Puliyankannu is Karai, another village that has been experiencing the impact of groundwater pollution. Sipping his morning coffee, Selvan recalls how Karai Eri used to be in his younger days: I used to drink water from the lake then. Now, the colour of the water scares me. Nobody uses it.Contaminated soil and waterIf there is one livelihood that has borne the brunt of this haphazard dumping of toxic metal, it is agriculture. Villagers say agricultural production has dwindled over the years, particularly in Puliyankannu and Karai, due to polluted groundwater. Nobody raises crops in this part of the region, says Sekar, a resident. Where is the source of good water to raise the crops?K. M. Balu, a farmer in Ranipet and coordinator of the Palar Paathukappu Kootiyakkam (Federation for Palar Protection), says the chromium dump site has destroyed the livelihood of hundreds of farmers: Ten villages in and around the dump site, such as Avarankari, Puliyankannu, Karai, Puliyanthangal and SIPCOT, have been badly hit. There is no scope for agriculture here.The matter has been brought up with officials at various levels, repeatedly, but their pleas have gone unheard, Balu says. Letters, protests... nothing has succeeded in drawing the attention of the authorities, he says. A petition sent to the Collector and to the Chief Ministers Special Cell three years ago has also led to nothing. Apart from his organisation, the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the All India Kisan Sabha, has also been unrelenting in its efforts to draw the attention of officials. The Palar river, nearly 2 km from the site, is also contaminated. Three water bodies  the Kodathappu Eri, the Karai Eri and the Puliyankannu Eri  have been contaminated. Villagers stopped using the groundwater several years ago, and they do not allow their cattle to graze near these water bodies, says L.C. Mani, the associations district assistant secretary.Mani estimates that at least 1,000 acres of agricultural land around TCCL have been rendered unfit for cultivation. What will farmers do when water even in farm wells has not been spared from this contamination? he asks. Crops such as paddy, ragi, maize and sugar cane were raised in this part of the region three decades ago but no longer, he says.Chromium is a heavy metal and so affects crops to a great extent, says M. Pandiyan, professor and head at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra and Agricultural Research Station, Virinjipuram. First, it does not allow the crops to grow as it prevents absorption of water and nutrients from the soil. Second, some crops that are tolerant, such as ragi, can withstand chromium and grow. But they end up absorbing it. Consuming them is dangerous as they can cause cancer.The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, in its Inventory and Mapping of Probably Contaminated Sites in India, says the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee had expressed serious concern over the extremely hazardous wastes dumped by Tamil Nadu Chromates and Chemicals in the open environment in violation of the hazardous waste rules.On its part, the CPCB, through the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF), identified 12 contaminated sites in the country that included TCCL in Ranipet. It came up with a project, the Remediation of hazardous waste contaminated dumpsites under NCEF project. According to the CPCBs online project documents, during its 20 years of operation from 1975 to 1995, TCCL generated and disposed huge quantities of hexavalent chromium-bearing waste on open land.A natural outcome of this are concerns over the health of the villagers. Mani and another resident of Puliankannu, A. Babu, say villagers are facing several health hazards due to the pollution of both air and water. We have been receiving many patients with asthma, both acute and chronic cases; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; even lung cancer, says Anbu Suresh, medical superintendent at the Scudder Memorial Hospital at Ranipet. We also see persons with allergic reactions to skin and eyes. These are mainly due to air pollution and water pollution. Of about 100 in-patients at the hospital, at least 30 to 40 of them were admitted for respiratory illnesses, he says.Shutting shopWhen it was established, TCCL functioned as a joint sector company. However, it operated under various private managements from 1989 before it shut down in 1995. An official of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) says it was shut down for causing pollution.C. Gnanaprakasam, 65, who worked as a production plant operator at TCCL from its inception, recalls the time when all was well. It began as a joint sector company promoted by TIDCO [Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation]. But later the companys major shares were sold and it shifted to private parties. We manufactured chromium for use in leather industries. There were 500 employees, and about 100-200 casual labourers, but this number dwindled as years passed. There were about 360 employees when it shut down, he says.TCCL started to face issues due to poor management, Gnanaprakasam says. Untreated sludge began to accumulate on its premises, forcing the TNPCB to issue a warning. The company shut down mainly due to polluting and mismanagement. We are yet to receive settlement from the company, the former employee says.Impact of chromiumThere have been numerous studies on the impact of the chromium in the site. According to the CPCB, a study conducted by the Geological Survey of India in 1996 reported that hexavalent chromium contamination spread south up to Karai village, which is located 1.5 km from the factory. The TNPCB conducted studies through the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and National Geophysical Research Institute to ascertain TCCLs impact on the environment.A few years ago, Ligy Philip, professor, Department of Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, and her colleagues, started intensive studies on bioremediation of chromium-contaminated soil and development of mathematical models for clean-up of hexavalent chromium-contaminated aquifers using bioremediation.One of the key findings is that the chromium sludge at TCCL has trivalent and hexavalent chromium. Hexavalent chromium is much more toxic compared to trivalent. We found that hexavalent chromium was leaching in to groundwater and contamination had spread for nearly two kilometres from the site, says the report.In fact, they had undertaken research on bioremediation with funding from the CPCB and went on to develop technology in the laboratory. Some time during 2009-2010, we demonstrated the technology at the Ranipet site on five tonnes of chromium sludge and 10 sq. m of aquifer (groundwater). We demonstrated bioremediation using bacterial strains that can reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium. The latter is less toxic and paves the way for easy absorption. It will not leach from the soil. Once hexavalent chromium in groundwater gets reduced, it is easily absorbed into the soil. Thus the water gets cleared from hexavalent and trivalent chromium, Philip says.Though the technology was not adopted at the TCCL site, it went on to find takers in three electro-plating industries, based in Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and North Chennai, that use chromium for electroplating during the manufacturing of automobile spare parts.It is in a pathetic condition, says L. Elango, professor in the Department of Geology, Anna University, of the chromium site at Ranipet. A recent visit to the site provided him an opportunity to take a closer look at the damage done by the chromium sludge. Chromium a highly toxic metal. Even the outer portion of the compound wall at the factory has become discoloured over the years. One can only imagine its effect on groundwater, he says.Elango points out that during rains, leaching from the site would flow through the drains and enter the Palar river, thereby contaminating it. The Palar river is the drinking water source not only for parts of Vellore such as Vaniyambadi, but also for parts of Chennai such as Tambaram. However, the chromium concentration in the water gets diluted following the rains and by the time it reaches Chennai, he says.While remediation in itself is a tedious process, he acknowledges the importance of early measures that could have prevented this scale of damage. One of the simplest ways could have been excavation. We could have at least isolated the chromium dumped here and covered it with tarpaulin sheet. We could have bundled it using polythene bags. This could have stopped leaching during the rains. But this should have been done at least 10 years ago, he says.However, remediation of chromium-contaminated groundwater is difficult, and mandates high technology intervention. One of the methods is to make use of redox reaction facilitated by bacteria that converts hexvalent chromium to trivalent chromium. This way, easily solvable hexavalent chromium can be converted to less solvable chromium, thereby reducing its movement, he says. Another way out is to pump the contaminated water and treat it by removing effluents.Though no pro-active steps have been taken to implement a remediation at the earliest, there have been many fora where the subject has been discussed. R. Natarajan recalls how the TNPCB had organised a meeting in 1995-1996 on chromium contamination in Ranipet and Ambur when he was consultant-cum-resident engineer of TIFAC at the Department of Science and Technology. He says scientists had presented papers for bringing about solutions to chromium contamination. One such paper had looked into electrochemical reactions to convert chromium salt into chromium metal. By that time, the groundwater had turned yellow or dark yellow, or brown due to concentration of chromium. Drinking this water could cause cancer. Converting it into trivalent chromium, which is non-toxic and non-carcinogenic, might prevent cancer, but is not the solution, he says.He adds: What should be looked into is how to convert it into a useful product. It can be converted into salt that is used for leather tanning as chrome is used for softening leather or into chromium metal. A pilot plant to implement this should be set up. The question is who will put up the plant?A solution in sight?If something did take off on a positive note, it was CPCBs move to engage a private consultancy to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) under the NCEF project. A private consultancy, ERM India Private Limited, was selected to prepare a DPR and provide consultancy services for remediation of eight identified contaminated sites.The consultancy has been studying the Ranipet chromium dump site for two years now. They have completed the field study and are in the process of finalising the DPR. Based on the results of the field study, they are drawing remedial options. We are expecting them to submit the DPR by the end of March this year, an official of the CPCB says.Once the DPR is submitted, the TNPCB and other stakeholders will be called in to finalise the remedial option depending on its feasibility and suitability, the official says. The CPCB would also call for global tenders to implement the selected remedial option.While the technical procedures are under way, what matters for the villagers is better living conditions. If these industries did not come up, we would still be drinking water from Puliyankannu Eri. Life would have been different. But the damage has been done, says Valliamma. All she can do now is hope that there is a solution after all.At least, the future generation should live in a less polluted environment in which they can easily access clean drinking water and breathe clean air, she dreams."

Thirugnanam, a resident of VGP Colony in Velachery, rued the shortage of pulses items in ration shop located at Ram Nagar. He said that customers visiting ration shops after the 15th of every month were told that only sugar and boiled rice were available.I usually get 1 kg of toor dhall at Rs. 30 a kg and urad dhall at the same price every month. I have been purchasing dhall through the public distribution system since 2006-07. However, when I went to the shop last month I was shocked to be informed that they did not have any stock of pulses, he said.Mary Theresa, a resident of Virugambakkam, said palm oil and kerosene too were not available in her shop.Last year, those who went to the shop before 10th of every month, did not get even rice. Senior citizens found it very difficult to stand in long queues at that time. Perhaps, separate time slots could be allotted for senior citizens, she said.A ration shopkeeper said they had not received stock of any pulses in February. He also said every month there was a shortage in supply of rice and pulses.Dhalls and palm oil come under the special public distribution system category. Though the scheme was introduced after 2006, it has been continuously implemented from 2011.The government used to extend the scheme by issuing a G.O. every year. But in the last two years, this extension has been done once in three months. Since the G.O. is yet to be issued, orders for the dhalls have not been placed, said a source.Eye on pollsPolitical commentators said that the government, perhaps, had ensured supply of dhalls till December with an eye on the local body elections.The uneconomical pricing of dhalls has been hurting the government financially. There was also a talk that the prices would be increased, but it was not done."

Malligere in Mandya district, committed suicide by hanging himself on March 17, a day after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah presented the Rs. 1.86 lakh crore State Budget. Prakashs mother filed a police complaint stating that upset over the Budget not specifying anything on farm loan waiver, he had ended his life.Prakash had borrowed Rs. 5 lakh for growing paddy, but the crop wilted owing to insufficient water supply. He had sunk a borewell last year, which too had dried up, according to the complaint.Even as the State and the Centre are engaged in a blame game over waiver of farm loans, 51 cases of farmer suicides have been reported in the State in the last three months. Over 842 cases were reported between April 2016 and March 2017.While January witnessed 40 cases of suicides, February and March saw six and five cases. Belagavi and Haveri witnessed the highest number of suicides (11 cases) in the last three months, followed by Shivamogga (five) and Mandya (four).It appears that four consecutive years of drought, scarcity of water for standing crops, depletion of ground water, failure of crops, growing debts, and lack of institutional support have been the main reasons for farmer suicides. In fact, farmers are in dire straits as 160 of the total 176 taluks in the State had been declared drought-hit following the failure of the south-west monsoon for three consecutive years.Minister for Agriculture Krishna Byre Gowda listed out 20 steps taken by the government to persuade farmers against taking the extreme step, including setting up of committees at district and sub-divisional levels to enforce the provisions under Karnataka Money Lenders Act.Describing the suicides as a pan-Indian phenomenon, T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, chairman, Karnataka State Agriculture Prices Commission, said: Trust deficit has become absolute for farmers. With unpredictable monsoon and market, farmers have lost faith in the system. They expected more from the NDA government, but were disappointed by the Budget, he said.As many as 1,332 cases have been filed against erring moneylenders and 585 persons have been arrested. The government released Rs. 45 crore towards loan waiver for 2016-17, besides releasing relief for crop loss.Krishna Byre GowdaMinister for AgricultureFarmers are not seeing any hope. Need of the hour is a holistic approach involving all departments concerned to boost the morale of the farming community.T.N. Prakash KammaradiChairman, Karnataka State Agriculture Prices CommissionThere are more cases than those reported. The phenomenon points at farmers losing faith in the governments. Owing to the policies of the Centre and State, sugarcane growers have stopped cultivating the crop and production has dipped considerably.Kurbur ShanthakumarPresident, Karnataka State SugarcaneGrowers Association"

The citrus fruit, resembling orange, has high juice content and is a favoured drink during winter.When the price of jaggery plummeted nearly five years ago, Roy Mathew, a farmer at Nachivayal in Marayur did not abandon sugarcane cultivation. Like his neighbours, he did not switch to long-term crops like areca nut or coconut either. Instead, he planted fruit plants in half-an-acre, cultivated vegetables, and continued to maintain the sugarcane field with a traditional jaggery making unit.Now, his fruit farm is full of apple, orange, star fruit (carambola), cherry, rambutan, guava, pomegranate, red papaya and plum trees. The man with a three-decade experience in farming says that the soil in Marayur is favourable for all fruits and vegetables.Though Marayur is in rain-shadow area, its soil is fertile. Unlike Kanthallur, located in an elevated area with a cool climate similar to Munnar, Marayur has the characteristics of a dry-deciduous forest. The fruit and vegetable production, quantitywise, may not be on par with the neighbouring Kanthallur or Vattavada, the vegetable hub of the State, he says. However, the quality of produce remains the same, he adds.Mr. Mathew tried to experiment with fruits and vegetables when the price of jaggery fell and the cost of production increased. The fall in groundwater level, which affected sugarcane production, was another reason. Mr. Mathew said he could maintain the sugarcane cultivation and the jaggery-making unit with the support of the vegetable cultivation.There is a good market for fresh fruits in Marayur with tourists offering better price than the market rate. A favourite of his is a citrus tree full of fruits similar to orange.Remedy for sore throatIt is an orange-like lemon with high water content. The fruit juice mixed with honey is a favourite drink of visitors to my farm, he says. Tourists on the way to and back from Munnar visit the farm ask for the citrus juice-honey mix, which is a medicine for sore throat, a common ailment affecting visitors to Munnar during winter.He says farmers should turn to low-cost fruit plants or vegetable cultivation instead of leaving the land idle. That ensures additional income and rejuvenate the soil, he claims."

Kamaraj on Thursday claimed there was no shortage of supplies of food items in ration shops and blamed rumour mongers for creating a situation where people were led to believe there was a shortage.At a press conference at the Secretariat, the Minister, however, refused to present the actual stock position of ration products.Contradicting his own statement, Mr. Kamaraj, said there was a delay in procuring items to be distributed under the special PDS scheme. Where there is an extension of the special scheme, there might be a slight delayabout 10 days of processing time. That delay might be there, he said.As far as stock is concerned, there is no problem. Everything has been set right, he said. When asked about the stock position, he said There is no issue at all.You cannot point out (to shortage at) one particular place and claim there is a shortage across the State. If you point out the location, we will take action, Mr. Kamaraj said. Rice was being given to ration cardholders without any problems.Wheat is being given as per requirement, if people want, in lieu of rice. But shopkeepers cannot force people to get some wheat instead of rice. If cardholders want 20kg of rice, it has to be given, he said.According to him, wheat and palm oil were being procured every month, and dhall too was available. Smart cards for all ration cardholders would be issued from April 1 and thereafter the PDS distribution would become seamless and without issues.Meanwhile, Minister for Cooperation Sellur K. Raju, said 4,640 tonnes of rice, 789 tonnes of sugar, and 262 tonnes of wheat were distributed under the PDS as on March 1.Every month roughly 2.95 lakh metric tonnes of rice, 31,868 tonnes of sugar, 13,602 metric tonnes of wheat, 23,638 tonnes of palm oil is distributed under the PDS, he said.PDS cardholders who face shortage of supplies can call 044-28592828 and raise complaints. They can call the helpline number 1967 if they have any queries or complaints."

It sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha and it has a 403-member Assembly.The State, however, does not fare well in important sectors like education, health, industry, and agriculture engages over 70 per cent of its people. The BSP has announced waiving farm loans of up to Rs. 1 lakh, while the BJP, the Congress, the SP and the RLD have made a similar promise albeit without announcing any such upper limits.In a bid to woo farmers, parties including the BJP and the SP have promised round-the-clock power supply while the Congress raised a similar pitch with its slogan karza maaf, bijli half (loan waiver and 50 per cent reduction in power bills).The BJP, in its manifesto called Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra , has also promised lower rates of interest on loans to farmers, an assurance which the SP has retained from its 2012 manifesto.The SP has promised to raise crop insurance scheme to Rs. 7.5 lakh from present Rs. 5 lakh, while also setting up a Treasury for Farmers.The issue of pending payments to sugarcane farmers in the State, particularly in western parts, has been simmering for quite some time now with parties highlighting it in their poll documents.The BJP has promised clearing all such dues within 120 days of coming to power, while the RLD has assured ensuring full payments in just two weeks time.Almost all the parties invariably have promised modernisation of the mandis and have given assurances of connecting them with technology to ensure fair price to the farmers for their yield and facilitate its sale.Congress listed its thrust areas to boost infrastructure and promised to ensure food security by providing wheat and rice at Rs. 3 and Rs 2 a kg, giving nutritious meal in Mid Day Meal scheme and revamping Public Distribution System.The BJP said that on lines of the central governments decision, no interview will be held for Class III and Class IV UP government jobs to end corruption in recruitment if it comes to power.Quota to be extendedThe BSP said if it gets back to power, quota facility will continue besides reservation will also be extended to the poor among the upper castes, based on their financial condition, even as SP, which promised extra reservation to Muslims in 2012, stayed mum on the matter this time.Ms. Mayawati, who has alleged politics of vendetta, said minorities and Dalits were framed and sent to jail during the SP rule while promising that these cases will be reviewed and those found innocent will be freed, as she eyed her traditional vote bank.The Congress manifesto vowed to appoint a police ombudsman to handle cases of police oppression and set up a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to ensure relief for victims of criminal oppression.Even as its ally SP stressed on social justice while boasting of all-round development during last five years, Congress has vowed to provide free legal aid to all members of the SC, ST, OBC communities and appoint Suraksha Mitra to assist in filing of cases committed against Dalits.Uttar Pradesh, which has time and again drawn flak for its law and order issues, notably has a 50 per cent shortage of police staff.According to a recent Union Home Ministry report, the UP Police has been working with 1.80 lakh personnel as against a sanctioned strength of 3.64 lakh.While Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has promised three promotions to police personnel on meet basis during the service tenure, the BJP manifesto states recruitment of 1.5 lakh personnel on vacant slots.The RLD has made a general pitch for early recruitments on all vacant positions under the State government.To ensure the safety of college girls, innovative antiRomeo squads will be set up near colleges to check eve-teasing, said BJP.While BJP once again raked up the issues of Triple Talaq and Ram temple, promising its construction through constitutional measures, Congress promised bringing in law against hate crimes.On exodus of people due to communal tension, BJP said a special team would be formed to check it at district level and the District will be held responsible in such matters.The Ajit Singh-led RLD has notably made a pitch for setting up four new benches of the Allahabad High Court, a demand that has been echoing in far-off parts of the State.Interesting overlapAn interesting overlap in promises has been seen in BJP and SP manifesto, both of which promised expanding the metro rail network, upgrading 100 police service, 108 ambulance service, among a few others.Framing of policies to ensure ease of doing business, job creations, promotion of local handicrafts, skill development of youth, establishing cold storages among others have found place in manifestos of all political parties.Invariably all parties manifestos promise improvement in healthcare services with BJP and SP assuring establishment of more AIIMS-like institutes, even as the first two AIIMS in Rae Bareli and Gorakhpur which were approved for UP in 2009 and 2012 respectively are yet to go operational. - PTI"

VenkatachalapathyFarmers of nearly 10 villages in Walajah and Katpadi taluks are worried about their land after a group of officials made stone markings on several of their properties stretching 20 km almost four months ago.Villagers said they were clueless about the project for which the markings had been made and have petitioned district officials seeking clarity.On Monday, during the weekly public grievance redressal meeting, representatives of a farmers association brought the issue to the notice of the district administration.L.C. Mani, district assistant secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam, said the stone markings were done in 10 villages from Edapalayam to Kodiyur and covering Lalapet, Nellikuppam, Katharikuppam, Kumanathangal, Kondakuppam, Palleri and Vasur villages.The stones erected on several plots of agricultural land have been marked with IOCL, GPS and so on in yellow colour. We learned about this only a week ago, and immediately took it up with revenue officials but they were not aware of this. We also met the Collector last week, and submitted a petition on Monday. The villagers are clueless as to why many of their fields were marked. They do not know from where officials came from, he said.The stone markings were also found on wells, waterbodies and canals in these areas, he added.He observed that the owners of the lands were not informed about the purpose of the markings.Group erected pillarsS. Venkatesan, a farmer in Vasur, said that nearly four to five months ago, a group of officers erected two stone pillars on his land.I asked them who they were and why they had entered my field but they spoke in Hindi and I did not understand a word. Later, some workers came to the land and erected two stone pillars after digging three to four feet. But even they did not tell me why, he said.He recalled how they sternly told the farmers not to disturb the markings in any way.We raise crops including groundnut, ragi, paddy and sugarcane. Many like me are scared that some huge gas pipeline project is coming up here. Nobody is giving us any information. We want a clear picture on what project is coming up as it involves agricultural lands. But we are definitely opposed to any project that will destroy our land, he said.R. Subash, president of Vellore east district, Tamizhaga Vivasaigal Sangam, along with nine farmers, visited the land on Monday.On some plots, the stone markings have been erected in the centre. Markings have also been done on transformers and rocks. We want officials to clarify what work has been proposed in this part of the district, he said.An official of the district administration said they had not received any intimation."

However, the Marathwada region witnessed twists with the Sena etching alliances with the Congress in some areas to stop the BJP staking claim to the presidents post.Strange alliancesCrucial alliances with the Sena were forged in western Maharashtras sugar-belt district of Sangli where the BJP had defeated the NCP in its bastion to secure 25 of the 60 seats and emerge as the largest party.The BJPs Sangramsinh Deshmukh was elected president while the Senas Suhas Babar was elected vice-president to the Sangli ZP. Likewise, in the 67-seat Kolhapur ZP, the BJP-Sena alliance saw Shaumika Mahadik (BJP) being propped to the presidents post.However, the NCPs Sarjerao Patil succeeded in becoming vice-president with the help of Congress.After much delay, the 72-member Ahmednagar ZP saw a Congress-NCP alliance with senior Congress leader (and Leader of Opposition in the State Legislative Assembly) Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patils wife, Shalini, emerging president with the backing of NCP.The NCPs Rajshree Ghule was elected vice-president.Cong-Sena factorMeanwhile in Marathwada, despite the BJP emerging as the single-largest party in the 62-seat Aurangabad ZP, the Congress and Sena joined hands to queer its pitch. The Sena with 18 seats, successfully elected its candidate Devyani Dongaonkar as president, while the Congress, which secured 16 seats elected Keshavrao Tayde-Patil as vice president.As in Aurangabad, the BJP, which emerged as the single largest party securing 22 of the 56-seat Jalna ZP, was upstaged by the Congress joining hands with NCP (which won 13).Anirudha Khotkar of the Sena (which won 14 seats) was elected president while Satish Tope of the NCP became vice-president.The loss of Jalna is seen as a loss of face for top BJP leaders like the State unit president Raosaheb Danve and Babanrao Lonikar, both of whom have their constituencies in this region.However, the BJP managed to turn the tables on the NCP in the fiercely-disputed Beed ZP.Seven supporters of rebel NCP leader Suresh Dhas backed the BJP today. Aided by the Shiv Sena and Vinayak Metes Shiv Sangram (a smaller BJP ally), the BJP reclaimed the Beed ZP with Savita Golhar becoming president while the Shiv Sangrams Jayshree Mhaske was elected vice-president."

Much of this is being procured by the 14 regional federations and sold in the regional market without brand recognition. However, now, these federations are preparing to brand and sell their produce in the retail market, particularly, in Bengaluru.One of the early birds is the Shivamogga District Regional Cooperative Organic Farmers Association Federation Ltd., which is expected to start branding its products  pepper, paddy, sugarcane, cashews, vegetables and soapnut powder  in Bengaluru by next week. We are cutting off the middleman, and so both farmers and customers can get a good rate. The Shivamogga brand will expand beyond the local market, said K. Ramappa, president of the federation.Similarly, over 160 tonnes of millets, jowar, turmeric, and toor from Raichur, Koppal and Ballari are expected to be branded within the next month. So far, we have been selling them at a premium in our local markets. But, we have not been able to sell them in big retail outlets. By tapping markets such as Bengaluru, the profits will increase and many more farmers will choose organic farming, said Ashok Patil, president of the federation formed for the three districts.With many of the 171 products with certifications overlapping among the 14 federations, the cooperatives  representing nearly 54,000 farmers  are in talks to fix a common logo, one that would help them in brand recognition.Organic certificationWaiting in the line for their turn to market is the federation from Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagalur and Udupi whose organic certification  primarily for lucrative pepper and cardamom  will turn three next year.Many traders will accept our products only after we get organic certification for three consecutive years. With access to the retail market in Bengaluru and other large metros, we can expect the price of our produce to rise further, said Anil D.M., president of the federation."

CFTRI had released 11 proven and successful technologies for free by publishing the Detailed Technology Dossiers on its website three years ago.Many entrepreneurs who attended the Thursdays event have adopted the technologies and are in the process of launching the products commercially.CFTRI Director Ram Rajashekaran explained the unique equitable model for empowering the first generation entrepreneurs by commercialising the free technologies. He spoke on the factors that drive the food industry. If you are willing to adopt the technology, we at the CFTRI are ready to give, he said.According to CFTRI, rice mix milk is a convenience food with long shelf life of six months. About 20-24 gm of rice milk granules can be mixed with 180 gm of boiling water followed by mixing and boiling for another one minute. If needed, 5 gm of sugar can be added to improve the taste. It contains 15.2% protein and 74.2% carbohydrate. The developed process is meant for addressing malnutrition in children aged between 6 months and 6 years.The CFTRI has developed the product at a cost of Rs. 57 lakh and revenue of Rs. 2.4 crore can be generated per annum by its commercialisation. Around 500 kg of rice mix milk can be prepared in a day at a production cost of Rs. 132 a kg.Using the foot-operated papad press, 400 papads can be made in a hour. Four papads can be pressed between two plastic sheets at a time and thickness can be varied. The technology can also be used to make gol gappas and chapatis. The unit is independent of the recipe. It can prepare papads from even horse gram, which is considered difficult using conventional methods, according to CFTRI."

When she enquired about the activities of the society, the farmers explained that they had come together to commercialise and leverage their produce in a better way without involving middle men.Besides cultivating wheat, turmeric, sugar cane, canola, and green chillies, they also maintained a desi cow dairy unit where they used to process dairy products. They sought help from the Minister to improve marketability of their produce.Impressed by the farmers, Ms. Badal recommended that they undergo training at the IICPT to know latest techniques in food processing and packaging. We are amazed at the range of services being offered by the IICPT experts on food processing and packaging. We also got to know processing of wheat, palm jaggery, milk, milk products and namkeen. The IICPT experts also taught us useful techniques to improve the shelf life of grains and spices. Our members are richer by our visit to Thanjavur, said Buta Singh, president of the society .Mr. Singh, while thanking the Union Minister for arranging the exposure-cum-training trip, expressed the need for such a training institution in their State. The team members invited the IICPT experts to visit their place and suggest ground reality based improvements to increase their productivity and provide value- addition to their agricultural produce.IICPT Director C.
