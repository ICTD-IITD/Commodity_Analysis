Ayyakannu , president, Desiya Thennindia Nadigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam, a Tiruchi-based farmers welfare organisation, is a relentless campaigner. An advocate-turned-farmer, Mr. Ayyakannu has been leading a series of agitations, some novel and others outlandish in forms, to draw the attention of the government to the plight of farming community over the past decade or so. Over the past week, he has been leading an agitation by farmers at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi. In a telephonic interview with S. Ganesan from New Delhi, he explains his demands. Excerpts.You have been leading a series of agitations in recent years. What are your demands now?The plight of farmers of Tamil Nadu has long been neglected. The BJP, in its election manifesto, promised to double farmers income. But farmers do not get remunerative price for their produce. Tamil Nadu is facing one of the worst droughts in over a century. A Central team toured the State to assess the drought situation and the State government sought Rs. 39,565 crore as drought relief from the National Disaster Response Fund. But, the Union government is yet to sanction funds. The severe drought and crop failure has resulted in death of several farmers in Tamil Nadu. Farmers are unable to repay their loans, but banks are auctioning jewels pledged by farmers. We want waiver of all crop loans sanctioned by nationalised banks. Since our agitations fell on deaf ears, we decided to go to New Delhi to draw the attention of the government. The agitation is also to press for linking of rivers.The State government has already sanctioned relief to farmers. What is your expectation from the Centre?The State government has only sanctioned input subsidy to farmers. Only the Centre can sanction compensation to the drought-hit farmers. Farmers should be sanctioned Rs. 25,000 an acre as compensation for paddy; Rs. 50,000 an acre for sugarcane, Rs. 1 lakh an acre for banana and other cash crops and Rs. 25,000 an acre for other rain fed crops. Farm labourers should be sanctioned Rs. 15,000 a month to compensate for the job loss.Union Minister of State Pon. Radhakrishnan and Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M. Thambi Durai have met you and urged you to withdraw your agitation. Your response?Mr. Radhakrishnan promised to organise a meeting with Union Agriculture Minister. We met Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday at the behest of Mr.Thambi Durai. Mr. Jaitley promised to consider our demands and announce a decision after consultations with officials. We have now converted our agitation into a silent protest. We will remain in New Delhi until the Centre announces a decision on our demands for sanction of drought relief and crop loan waiver. We will not leave till then.What has been the response to your agitation and how is the morale of agitators?We are into our eighth day of the agitation. We struggled initially for a couple of days as we had to sleep on the roadside, were exposed to extreme weather conditions and faced difficulty in even finding food. But soon, a lot of Tamil youths living here came to our support and are providing us food. Nearly 25 of our members suffered from diarrhoea and had to undergo treatment. We have sent back some of them home and currently we have about 84 members here. There has been overwhelming support and response to our agitation."

The protesters also called for compensation ofRs. 25,000 per acre for paddy, Rs. 50,000 per acre for banana plantains, and Rs. 75,000 per acre for sugar cane farmers as drought relief. A demand was also made to provide compensation of Rs. 15,000 per family for farm labourers.Slamming demonetisation and the insistence on cashless transactions, the CPI (M) also demanded compensation for those who had collapsed waiting outside banks post-demonetisation. They also challenged the insistence of Aadhaar card for transactions.The protesters demanded a judicial inquiry into the police assaults on pro-jallikattu protesters across the state and withdrawal of cases against them.The protests were held at Dharmapuri, Paapireddypatty, Pennagaram, Harur, and Palacodde. Similar protests were held here outside the head post office in Krishnagiri.Special Correspondent from Erode adds:Hundreds of CPI (M) cadre were arrested on Tuesday when they attempted to stage road blockade across the district as part of a statewide agitation to condemn anti-poor policies of the Central and State governments.Police said 386 men and 287 women were arrested at Erode, Bhavani, Anthiyur, Gobi, Sathy, and Perundurai.Former MLA R.Annadurai, who led the protest at Erode Bus Stand, assailed the Central and State governments accusing them of dragging their feet on disbursing drought relief.Due to the unprecedented drought conditions, farmers were badly in need of financial assistance.Likewise, the number of workdays per year under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme must be doubled to 200. The protesters raised slogans blaming the Central and State governments for suicides by farmers in distress. They also slammed the Centre for its demonetisation drive, and the pathetic state of education in government school, rampant corruption in government offices and the decline in quality of treatment in government hospitals.Salem Staff Reporter adds:Over 150 Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadre staged road block near Collectorate here on Tuesday demanding compensation to the farmers whose crops were damaged due to drought.Led by its district secretary P. Thangavel, They demanded setting up of Cauvery Management Board. They said that due to demonetisation, many workers lost their job and their families were affected. The government should provide free education, health care to all, they said. The cadre were removed and lodged at marriage hall. Protests were held at Mettur, Omalur, Attur and other parts of the district.In Namakkal district, the protest was held in Tiruchengodu opposite the nationalised bank. Protest was held in Rasipuram and other places."

Randeep said in a release that input subsidy has been transferred to the SB accounts of 52,584 farmers so far. According to the norms, the amount is to be transferred directly to the SB accounts provided they are linked with Aadhaar numbers.However, there are 25,293 farmers who are eligible for input subsidy but have failed to link their bank accounts and Aadhaar numbers, Mr. Randeep said. Saying that the amount is non-transferable then, he appealed to such farmers to comply with the Aadhaar norms by Sunday, failing which they risk forfeiting input subsidy. H.D. Kote taluk leads with 6,279 such farmers, and is followed by Nanjangud (5,862), Mysuru (4,248), K.R. Nagar (3,278), Hunsur (2,548), Periyapatana (2,179) and T. Narsipur (899).A senior official said Rs. 6,800 a hectare, up to a maximum of 2 hectares, could be claimed for crop loss under the National Disaster Response Fund norms, with the amount varying from farmer to farmer.However, Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Sugarcane Cultivators Association, said this was peanuts and means little for most farmers. Against a loss of nearly Rs. 20,000 a hectare in case of paddy, the farmers are eligible for only up to Rs. 6,800 for a maximum of 2 hectares, subject to various conditions. This exercise itself was an eyewash, he said."

Besides, it possesses many healthy properties on account of its high fibre content.The study was conducted for over a year by Lalitha Ramaswamy, had of the Department of Nutrition at the PSG College of Arts and Sciences, Coimbatore, along with S.R. Priya.Coconut flour is a rich source of dietary fibre, protein and low in digestable carbohydrates and is good for preventing cancer, heart ailments and diabetes. Another feature of this product is that this is gluten free, Ms. Ramaswamy said.She explained that the process of producing coconut flour is done by grating the coconut and letting it dry after washing it thoroughly and removing the oil. Once dried, it is then powdered to be used as flour.It can be added in porridge to slow down the sudden increase in blood sugar. It can also be used for making cookies and rusk, she added.This product is not available in India but marketed in the U.S. and Europe , where coconut is not grown. Entrepreneurs here should come forward to set up units, she said."

Jeyasingh Gnanadurai, former Joint Director for Agriculture and a progressive farmer, wanted the State Assembly to pass a resolution against extraction of hydrocarbon at Neduvasal in Pudukottai district. It was only after the Centres assurance that no extraction of hydrocarbon would happen at Neduvasal that farmers and youths gave up their prolonged protest. But, now the Centre has gone back on its promise and given licence for extraction of hydrocarbon, Mr. Gnanadurai said.Recalling that the Centre had acted against the interests of delta farmers by refusing to set up Cauvery Management Board as per the Supreme Courts recommendation, he asked why should the people of Tamil Nadu allow the Centre to extract hydrocarbon.The present form of Crop Insurance Scheme did not benefit the farmers in letter and spirit, he said, adding all those farmers who had faced crop loss due to successive droughts and paid premium for crop insurance should be compensated.The association members wanted the Central and State governments to provide drought relief at the rate of Rs. 20,000 per acre and waive crop loans extended by cooperative banks as well as nationalised banks. The State government should immediately ban smuggling of sand to neighbouring States like Kerla and Karnataka.Among their other demands were banning of exploitation of Tamirabarani river water by multinational soft drink companies, construction of check dams across the rivers, desilting of major dams and immediate distribution of outstanding amounts due to sugarcane farmers. Progressive farmers Alathur Govindan, A. Alaguservai, K. Thanikodi were among the protesters."

Veera Raghava Rao.Speaking to reporters at Upilakudi near Melur near here on Friday, where he was inspecting desilting of tank under the kudimaramathu scheme undertaken by the PWD by involving ayacutdars and local villages, Mr. Rao said that the showers during March had, to an extent, helped in recharging the watertable in some places, and also given some wetness in and around the district.Above all, the steady discharge from the Periyar dam (225 cusecs daily) to the Vaigai dam had facilitated in maintaining the water level around 25 feet (against the maximum level of 71 feet).Moreover, illegal tapping of water in between the Periyar dam and the Vaigai dam had been tightened by the close monitoring of officials of Theni district that 532 tap services had been disconnected by all officials concerned, including Town Panchayat, Village Panchayat and Municipality.After the farmers raised objection at the recent grievance meeting, to water being drawn by two private companies including a sugar mill from Vaigai dam, the Collector clarified that it had been reduced by one-third considering the prevailing drought.On the progress of kudimaramathu, he said that 72 works at about Rs. 6 crore had been taken up by the Periyar Vaigai Basin Division, Gundar Basin Division and Periyar Main Canal Division (Melur).The works were at different stages... and hope to be completed within the next 100 days, he replied.PWD Executive Engineer A.R.K. Prabhu said that apart from removing karuvelam trees in the chain of tanks and other waterbodies, the tank desilting works and strengthening bunds were carried out across the division.With Melur and peripheries getting a major chunk of works, he hoped to complete it as per the schedule. After desilting, the Uppilakudi tank near Thumbaipatti would have a maximum capacity of 10.68 million cusecs and can feed water for irrigation to 77.80 hectares of land."

58fa6db8a3d24b44f321cebd,Manipur drug-makers prove elusive for police,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/manipur-drug-makers-prove-elusive-for-police/article17899514.ece,2017-04-10,"In the second week of March, M. Pradip, Superintendent of Police of Thoubal district, Manipur, got an SMS on his mobile phone, tipping him off about a drug trafficker at Moijing village in the district. The man was allegedly manufacturing opium and heroin in an improvised mobile unit. The informer had switched off his phone when Mr. Pradip rang back, but the information appeared authentic.A raid was immediately ordered. But the intelligence network of the drug traffickers, it turned out, was efficient too. They had time to flee, taking the drugs with them. The only things they could not cart away were sackfuls of opium, manufacturing equipment, utensils and chemicals such as ammonium chloride and lime.The lone person around was an aged and sick woman, who appeared disoriented, Mr. Pradip told The Hindu .It was the same story in subsequent raids as well. The villagers do not welcome police and security personnel in their areas. There have been instances when they destroyed Army jeeps or viciously attacked police personnel who went in search of drug pushers and other criminals.Golden triangleManipur, which is contiguous with Myanmar and falls in the golden triangle, is a fertile ground for poppy cultivation. Farmers grow them in vast areas of the valley and the hills.The occasional destruction of the verdant poppy plants has not impacted the thriving business. The poppy-growing season does not clash with paddy crop. And the income from poppy is huge, an anti-narcotics official say. Anti-narcotics officials can do little, because the department is understaffed and officials have to work by the book. They cannot destroy the vast cultivations.Women bring in the stuff in sacks of vegetables, charcoal and other items. They sell the poppy fruits in the villages in Thoubal district.EC warningAhead of the March elections in Manipur, the Election Commission of India had informed the government about the presence of mobile drug laboratories producing opium, brown sugar and heroin. But the kingpins, who allegedly get huge funding from drug barons across the country, are still at large.Most of the villagers resent raids and see them as an anti-Muslim move. But officials suspect that some protesters backing stone-throwing and firings may actually be beneficiaries of the drug cartel. The possibility of moles in the force is not ruled out since drug traffickers always seem to be many steps ahead of the police.Opium, brown sugar and heroin are smuggled out to many States. As thousands of vehicles ply daily along the highways passing through Manipur, it is easy to transport drug packets without being noticed.Informed circles say the local drug production in Manipur has not affected drug smuggling from across the border. Huge quantities of prescription drugs are smuggled out for drug production. Some years ago, the police nabbed members of a gang engaged in such drug smuggling. The last catch was worth over Rs. 30 crore in the local market. One ranking Army officer and the son of a prominent politician were among those arrested. Huge consignments of prescription drugs were sent through post offices, air cargoes and private couriers. Despite many seizures, no significant arrests were made.The police are now trying to create awareness among the villagers. Mr. Pradip says that the grim reality has sunk in.Anti-narcotics officials feel that drug smugglers have found their movement restricted after the Assam Rifles manning the 358 km long Manipur-Myanmar border stepped up vigilance against militants."

Thirunavukkarasar has said.In a statement, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar said that Rs. 2,300 crore dues are pending to be paid to sugarcane farmers. Twenty-four private sugar mills in Tamil Nadu which have been procuring sugarcane from the farmers have not paid them for the past four years as per the rates fixed by the government, the TNCC chief said.The Congress leader said this had led to Rs. 1,850 crore outstanding on the part of the sugar mills, while another Rs. 450 crore is pending from 18 cooperative and State-run sugar mills.When Rs. 2,300 crore is outstanding, the Tamil Nadu government has set aside only Rs. 127 crore in the budget. Why is the State government hesitant to ask the private mills to pay up? The government should have tripartite talks with the sugarcane farmers and sugar mills and ensure that this issue is resolved at the earliest, he said.During the day, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar met Nel Jayaraman, a crusader of organic farming, and handed over a cheque of Rs. 50,000 on behalf of the Congress.Mr. Jayaraman is currently undergoing treatment for cancer."

A compensation of Rs. 30 lakh should be sanctioned to families of farmers who had died due to crop failure.Expressing dissatisfaction over the quantum of compensation announced by the State government, the meet called for enhancing the amount to Rs. 30,000 an acre for paddy, Rs. 1 lakh an acre for banana and Rs. 50,000 an acre for sugarcane and betelvine. Steps should be taken to expedite the disbursement of compensation under the crop insurance scheme for 2015-16 and the current season also, it demanded.Since farmers were faced with difficulties in sourcing cattle fodder, the State government should arrange for supply of fodder free of cost to them, another resolution demanded. It suggested the construction of check dams across the Cauvery and Coleroon rivers to shore up rainwater and help maintain the groundwater table.

A team of two students was asked to work with a farmer and for the purpose, five farmers were chosen by the authorities with whom the students have been working since October 20 last.The farmers here can generate more revenue opting for horticulture than crops like paddy and sugarcane. But these crops involve intense labour work while farmers find it hard to get labourers to work in the farm. This has become a huge deterrent for them to opt for horticulture crops, said Shilpa Karat, one of the students on study tour.The State government should promote horticulture crops and support farmers in several ways as they have odd work timings, unlike in other professions, and they also face add situations sometimes, said Anupa, another student.Anusha Reddy, one of the students in the team, referred to Ramesh, a farmer with whom they were working, and said he was able to purchase more land by generating good revenue cultivating horticulture crops.The students are good in the subject they are studying and they have better knowledge than us. However, they do not have practical knowledge and have much more to learn, said Ramesh, when asked about his experience working with the students."

Selvam and N. Authinathan directed Special Government Pleader M. Govindan to take notice on behalf of the Revenue Secretary and adjourned the case till June 9 for filing a counter affidavit.R. Mariappan, a farmer from Yettayapuram in Thoothukudi district, had filed the PIL petition questioning the discrimination being shown between big and small farmers in the GO.The petitioner said that the government had taken into consideration the huge deficit rainfall and other adverse factors during the north-east monsoon last year before declaring all 32 districts in the State drought-affected.Accordingly, a G.O. was issued on January 10 this year for providing input subsidy for farmers who had suffered 33% of crop loss and more.Subsequently, the Director of Agriculture submitted a proposal to the government stating that 18,73,337 hectares under agricultural crops such as paddy, millets, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane and perennial crops had been affected due to recent drought and therefore his directorate alone would require Rs. 2,049 crore for providing assistance to those farmers.Similarly, the Director of Horticulture submitted a proposal seeking Rs. 196.88 crore for providing assistance to farmers for loss of horticultural crops such as fruits, vegetables, spices, plantations, flowers and medicinal crops grown on 1,63,695 hectares.The Director of Sericulture too sent a separate proposal seeking Rs. 1.09 crore for loss of mulberry crops on 1,480 hectares.Three proposalsThe Revenue Secretary placed all three proposals before a high-level committee meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on February 21 and obtained sanction for the entire sum from State Disaster Relief Fund.The Chief Minister also ordered immediate disbursement of the input subsidy by crediting it into the bank accounts of affected farmers.However, the Government Order issued on the same day said the relief would be restricted to five acres for big farmers as per the National Disaster Relief Fund and SDRF norms, and that small and marginal farmers would be entitled to get relief for entire area of their landholding.The PIL petitioner said many farmers who had taken more than five acres of land on annual lease would be affected severely if their loss was not compensated adequately by the State despite them having suffered the most due to deficient rainfall and consequent unavailability of water for agriculture."

She is someone who understands what it is like for little hands to work, or for women to be abandoned by their families, having walked these difficult paths herself.Today, she is the vice-president of Avani, a non-governmental organisation in Kolhapur that helps rescue child labourers and works with underprivileged, abandoned women. I always desired to work for child labour as I underwent a great deal of hardship and pain and could easily relate to their suffering, she says.Her storyThe eleventh of 12 children, Ms. Bhosale had to work as a domestic help in Shrirampur, Ahmedabad, where she was born, as the family faced a financial crunch. Her father was a pre-primary teacher and earned a salary of Rs. 150. Ms. Bhosale earned Rs. 10 as domestic help. However, she nurtured a deep desire to pursue education, which she felt, was the only way to improve ones position in life.I was fortunate that my employers allowed me to go to school, says Ms. Bhosale. On completing Class V, she had to be shifted to a missionary-run girls hostel at Harigaon, Ahmednagar, as the family moved back to their home town at Bhokar, Ahmednagar. However, here again, she had to face humiliation as she couldnt afford to pay the monthly fee of Rs. 25. My mother did various jobs and worked very hard as she wanted me to pursue my dreams. However, despite working late into the night, she could never pay my monthly fees, she recalls. Gradually, it dawned upon her teachers that she was a committed student and her fee was waived. Whatever I could give was accepted by the institution.Ms. Bhosale wanted to do a lot more in life. She completed her graduation from Nirmala Niketan College of Social Work, Mumbai, in 1991. A priest with whom she worked at the age of 16 while doing odd jobs at a church bought her bus tickets. She stayed at the girls hostel and the same priest paid her tuition fee for two months. However, later she received financial support from the college. Some of the teachers too helped me financially for the study tour, recalls Ms. Bhosale. On completing the fifth year of the course, she started working with migrant children who crushed rocks used in paving roads in Kolhapur. She introduced these families to the principles of micro-finance and assisted in setting up self-help groups for women.In 1995, she fell in love and got married, but domestic violence plagued the marriage from the start. Neither her husband nor her in-laws supported her social activities, but she carried on. In 1996, she joined the Verala Development Society (VDS), whose mission was to provide homes to homeless, divorced and widowed women in Sangli and Kolhapur districts. The next year she joined Avani, a VDS project to conduct surveys of migrant children in Kolhapur.This was what I had been craving for, and it was perhaps the most memorable moment of my life, she says. However, while she found solace in work, her marriage was steadily deteriorating, and she had to leave home with a six-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son, with just the clothes they were wearing. I did not have family or close friends to rely on. I now realised the plight of women and their children who were so often kicked out of home. I no longer sympathised with them; I understood the true meaning of empathy.At first, a friend offered her a place to stay. Other friends helped her financially for the next few months. Fortunately, help came from unexpected quarters as well: Arun Chavan, Chairman of Avani, Comrade Govind Pansare, former Communist leader of Kolhapur who fought legal battles for the underprivileged and Dr. Sunil Kumar Lawate, social worker in Kolhapur. Gradually, she began to make progress in her chosen field, attracting followers in the process too.U.S.-based Dr. Arun Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, has been one of the biggest supporters of Avani. He visits Avani every year along with the people from different parts of the world just to acquaint them with our work. He appreciates our work and motivates our volunteers, she says.I was introduced to Avani through Dr. Gandhi, says Scott Kafora, an architect from the U.S., and an Avani volunteer for the past six years. Mr. Scott has travelled to almost 30 countries working for the betterment of children. He is committed to improving the economic, social, emotional, and educational needs of underprivileged children around the world. Certified to teach English as a second language, he shares his knowledge of maths, science, reading, and computers free of charge. I was greatly impressed to see Anuradhas passion and how she tirelessly works to unite child labourers with their families. She works at the grass-root level and this is very impressive, says Mr. Scott, who is now working towards the construction of a childrens home at Kolhapur.What Avani doesThe main aim of Avani is to educate, empower and unite women who are widowed, divorced or abandoned. Since August 2011, as many as 53,216 women received government entitlements in the form of cash and their children no longer needed to work as child labourers.Since 1995, Avani has rescued 9,200 children in Kolhapur district, and they have been enrolled in the schools nearby. Avani also rescues migrant children and provides them with safe housing at Kolhapur. With the help of the government, we implement housing schemes for their families, says Ms. Bhosale. Avani operates 21 schools in the brickyard labour camps, where over 1,100 migrant children get an education.Avani has also rescued children from sugarcane fields, construction sites, domestic work, street begging, retail shops, hotels, lodges and even from exploitation from their own families. In 2005, Avani started a daycare centre for migrant children, providing them with nutrition, clothes and safe housing, besides education. Avani also operates 10 day care centres for the children of waste pickers in Kolhapurs slums.Avani organises local community and grassroots fundraising campaigns throughout the year. They also try to raise funds by selling handmade Diwali greeting cards and lanterns and Raksha Bandhan bracelets. All the proceeds go back into the programme.Ms. Bhosale says, Long-term change can only be accomplished by encouraging people to educate and do things for themselves. Avani works to educate and sensitise government departments on the implementation of the laws and schemes already in place to help those in need.My greatest satisfaction is how Avani has been able to educate the brickyard owners that it is against the law to employ child laborers under the age of 14 and that these children have the legal right to attend government schools. Because of Avanis work in the community, there is now tremendous awareness of the rights of children and the Child Labour Act, which is very heartening,"
58fb634fa3d24b44f321f0b9,The art of building majorities,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-art-of-building-majorities/article17459215.ece,2017-03-14,"The State elections of 2017 clearly demonstrate that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has replaced the Congress as the principal national party in the country. It won massive victories in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and emerged as a big player in Manipur. In Goa it remained the single largest party in terms of vote share despite a hugely unpopular outgoing Chief Minister. The only disappointment is Punjab where the party was routed with its senior partner Shiromani Akali Dal after ruling the State for 10 years.The spectacular performance of the BJP in U.P. should not detract from its formidable achievements in the recently concluded local elections, where it made huge strides in previously uncharted territory. In Odishas Zilla Parishad elections, the party expanded its footprint from 36 seats in 2012 to 306 in 2017, snatching second place away from the Congress to become a formidable contender to the long incumbent Biju Janata Dal. In Maharashtra, the BJP won eight of 10 municipal corporations with its total number of seats nearly equal to that of all other parties combined.Explaining the riseThe electoral success of the BJP raises an important question. Without being able to meet expectations built up in 2014, in the absence of a surging economy, and with the poor decision on demonetisation, how is the party achieving so much success? There is one obvious reason: Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains very popular while the Congress partys leadership no longer resonates with voters. However, leadership is not the only factor. The BJP is acquiring hegemonic status in the Indian polity owing largely to ideological consolidation and its creation of an unparalleled election machine.The BJPs ideology has more takers than before because the party frames the main issues for the elections. Its long-standing ideological association with nationalism renders nationalism an issue on which it has a huge advantage over all other parties. Parties that are able to successfully shape election campaigns around their own issues ultimately succeed in winning elections. By placing a large emphasis on nationalism, the party has cleverly tailored its ideological message to be able to capture the imagination of a larger section of the public. It has opened ideological battlefronts in many different spheres  from universities to movie theatres  and promoted conflicts across the board. It has also placed a large emphasis on other issues that it has traditionally been associated with, such as national security and terrorism, patriotism and more recently, corruption.For a very long time the Jan Sangh and then the BJP relied almost exclusively on the hard-line Hindu nationalists who reside with its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). This is no longer the case. Hindu traditionalists, those who are drawn to a conservative Hindu way of life but are largely opposed to the hard-line Hindutva world view and its intolerance towards other religions, have now shifted their support from the Congress to the BJP. This allows the BJP to win elections without nominating a single Muslim, as it did recently in U.P.Forging multi-caste coalitionsThe party has also revamped its electoral strategy, one focussed on widening its appeal by stitching together multi-caste coalitions. As is widely known, the BJPs traditional social base is predominantly upper caste. To increase its support base, it has been building an electoral machine of its own at the local level in the form of caste-based coalitions. Fully aware that the party would not receive much support from the Muslims and perhaps even the Jatavs, the former traditionally associated with the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the latter with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), its leaders targeted the smaller groups that dont have adequate representation in any of the larger parties. For instance, the BJP tied up with parties like the Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, giving it the support of a large section of the Kurmi and Rajbhar populations, respectively. It also increased its ticket allocations to non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits. Its campaign was led by a galaxy of local and national leaders, together covering an eclectic set of caste groups  almost a Congress-style coalition  but without the Muslims and some Dalit communities.The BJPs active use of state patronage has also played a big role in strengthening its national footing. In States where the party has come to power, and even at the national level, it has actively worked to break down the existing patronage machinery and replace it with one of its own. For instance, in Maharashtra, a State ruled by the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for more than a decade before the Devendra Fadnavis government assumed office, the BJP has been steadily dismantling the patronage structures put in place by its predecessors. Through ordinances and amendments, the government has managed to severely weaken the hold of NCP and Congress leaders on the powerful cooperative bodies in the State, including the cooperative sugar factories which have been under the tight grip of NCP leader Sharad Pawar for decades. The government not only created a provision whereby it could appoint independent members to the boards of these bodies, but also imposed restrictions on the existing board members, hailing largely from the Congress or NCP, from contesting elections to particular cooperative banks. At the national level, the Modi government removed scores of previous United Progressive Alliance-era political appointees, particularly those notorious for their role in creating the large NPA (non-performing assets) problem facing the public sector banks today, and replaced them with its own people.Risks of rapid expansionOn the electoral front, this has translated into the BJP aggressively co-opting individuals and units of other parties to strengthen its leadership. From Rita Bahuguna Joshi in U.P. to Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, the BJP has taken in many rival leaders into its fold before elections. This resembles the strategy followed by the Congress in the 1970s, at the peak of Indira Gandhis rule. While in the short term, this strategy is giving the party immense electoral success and helping it expand its footprint, just as it had done for the Congress back then, in the medium to long term it poses grave risks. Many politicians and smaller parties have joined the BJP bandwagon as it looks the most lucrative option electorally, and they may desert it at next chance. In addition, as the BJP continues to bring into its fold leaders and parties from outside its ideological umbrella, it risks diluting the content of its ideology over time. If uninhibited, this could also lead to tensions between the BJP and the RSS.The BJP has undoubtedly replaced the Congress as the dominant national party and the cornerstone of Indias political and electoral system. This development has squeezed the space for centre-left forces in Indias polity and has given popular legitimacy to the centre-right narrative on issues of nationalism, secularism and social justice. As Yogendra Yadav has rightly pointed out, the centre-left needs a new vocabulary on the issue of social justice as the BJP has managed to convince a large section of society that the lefts language on the issue reeks of biases based on caste and religion.However, in order for the BJP to remain the dominant national party for a sustained period of time, it too needs to introspect to ensure it isnt compromising long-term success for short-term rewards. Going forward, it should continue to widen its social base while ensuring it doesnt lose its ideological identity. Otherwise, it will only remain dominant as long as a Mr. Modi remains at the helm. As when individuals acquire larger salience over ideology and organisation in parties, it leads to their decline down the road. That is exactly what happened to the Congress.Pradeep Chhibber and Rahul Verma are with the University of California, Berkeley. Harsh Shah is an alumnus of the University of California, Berkeley"

Nallakannu said.Speaking to reporters after taking part in a demonstration organised by All India Kisan Sangh here on Tuesday, he deplored that the Union government had not allocated sufficient funds for drought relief.The Centre should release more funds so that Rs. 25,000 an acre (for paddy) could be given to farmers as compensation for crop loss.While over 250 farmers had died of shock or committed suicide following the crop loss, 17 families alone had got relief.Officials had not taken into account withered coconut, mango and palmyrah trees in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari districts in their survey.Even as the southern districts are facing drought condition and the people are struggling to get drinking water, the Tamirabharani water is being supplied to industries and power stations. A check-dam has been constructed across the Tamirabharani near Seevalaperi to supply water to soft drink manufacturing units. If water supply from the Tamirabharani continues, it will trigger State-wide agitations, Mr. Nallakannu warned.He came down heavily on the killing of a Thangatchimadam fisherman on high seas on Monday. The Lankan Navy continues to hunt down Tamil fishermen and damages their boats and nets. The Union Government, which should consider Tamil fishermen as Indian fishermen, should find a solution for this issue without delay, he said.The demonstration was organised demanding Rs. 50,000 an acre for sugarcane, Rs. 75,000 for plantain, Rs. 20,000 for a coconut tree, waiver of crop loans given by cooperative and nationalised banks and Rs. 25 lakh to the family of every farmer who committed suicide or died of shock due to crop loss."

Frustrated, she said,  Notebandi (demonetisation) has ruined us. There has been extreme financial difficulty, and expressed support for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party. Her husband came running, stood in front of her, and exclaimed, She has no idea what shes talking about. [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] is doing a great job, and he will rid this country of corruption. Notebandi hasnt been too bad. He will support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) this time. The woman continued to mock her husband from behind: Cant you see? Clearly, Mr. Modi has given him so much money. A crowd gathered around, laughing at the jeers; even her husband cracked a smile.A young farmer seemingly threw his support behind the Congress: The Congress was clearly better for farmers. Another woman spoke highly of Mayawati and her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Yet, in this jumble of party preferences, no one offered an identity-based reason for their inclinations even though everyone was from the Jat community.Economic preferencesThe sheer diversity and complexity of party preferences observed in discussions in the Jat neighbourhood is quite common. All across U.P., our conversations with homogeneous identity groups, whether caste or religion, often yield heterogeneous pronouncements of partisan support. Of course, identity still fundamentally structures social hierarchies and inequalities in daily life. However, the simplistic assignment of identity groups to particular political parties, a standard practice among political analysts in India, is far from the empirical reality. Worse yet, it is a form of analysis that robs the Indian voter of her personal agency and decision-making faculties; most voters are not a priori committed to a single party and weigh their options carefully. Even the Jatav community, which most believe is largely beholden to Ms. Mayawati and the BSP, displayed significant support for the BJP in 2014. It is precisely this perpetual churning in the electorate that makes elections unpredictable and results volatile; after all, no party has held on to the chief ministership of U.P. for more than a single term since the breakdown of Congress rule in 1989.In this election, close observers of U.P. politics have noticed a discernible shift in the Jat community, which seemingly overwhelmingly supported the BJP in the 2014 general election, to the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), a largely Jat party led by Ajit Singh. Yet, despite the optics of it, what is striking is that the most commonly cited frustrations in the Jat community are not framed in explicitly identity-based terms, but rather in economic terms. Jats expressed their anger with the BJP based on the impact of demonetisation and poor implementation of interest-free loans that were promised to local sugar cane farmers. Even when pushed on the Jat demand for caste reservations, a young Jat farmer told us that the most preferred system would be to have reservations based purely on economic need or not to have them at all. The Jats, like virtually every other identity group, are not beholden to a single party. As parties must compete for the sympathies of voters, they often resort to promises of economic delivery. This leads to an increased salience of economic preferences, whether in delivery of benefits or in large-scale development, in determining vote choice.Modis appealU.P. was the crown jewel in the Modi wave in the 2014 national election, with the BJP and its allies securing an incredible 73 out 80 Lok Sabha seats (more than a quarter of the seats the BJP won in the election). While the religious polarisation in Muzaffarnagar received media attention, U.P., like much of the country, was convinced of Mr. Modis promises of jobs and economic growth. As Prime Minister, he seemed well positioned to deliver given his tenure as the Chief Minister of the economically developed State of Gujarat and a stark contrast to the feckless Congress government that was ruling the country. But nearly three years into his term, Mr. Modis economic accomplishments are wanting. According to the Labour Bureau, the last two years of the previous government (2013 and 2014) produced at least four lakh new jobs a year, whereas the first two full years of the Modi government (2015 and 2016) yielded just one to two lakh new jobs a year. Voters may not vote on the basis of any macroeconomic indicator, but they can directly feel the impact of low economic and job growth.In our travels in Bihar during the Assembly elections campaign of late 2015, BJP supporters often mentioned Mr. Modi as the only person who could bring jobs to the country, but that sort of language has all but disappeared now in U.P. Mr. Modi has staked his appeal on being a decisive leader instead. A young Jatav woman we met weeks ago in Firozabad district made this point: Mr. Modi is a very good person. I like him. He is decisive and speaks well. However, she will be supporting the BSP in this election. Therein lies the problem for the BJP; State elections are more likely to be fought over the delivery of benefits and public goods, and these are the sort of appeals the BJP has all but abandoned. In Shamli district, a middle-aged Jat farmer was more direct: It is Modis government at the Centre. Doesnt he have the power to give us money?Akhileshs popularityMuch like Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar, Akhilesh Yadav has staked his reputation on enlarging the role of the state in the broad-based delivery of public goods and benefits while trying to shed the image of a standard caste leader. According to a report published by the Accountability Initiative analysing State budgets in India, U.P. was just one of four States that saw an increase of 5% or more between the last two Budgets in the share of social services as a share of State government expenditure. This also applies to investment in large-scale infrastructure, as, according to Budget estimates from the RBI, the proportion of the Gross State Domestic Product spent on capital outlays in development expenditure (5.8%) is second highest among non-special category States in India. The increased role of the state has produced tangible, visible outputs that have fuelled an undercurrent of popularity for Mr. Yadav. An upper caste driver from Kanpur told us, Near my home Akhilesh turned a one-lane road into a four-lane road. I am committed to the BJP, but I am hopeful that Akhilesh becomes the next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Despite satisfaction with Mr. Yadavs work, the driver remains persuaded by Mr. Modis character and hopeful he can begin to make an economic impact in the future.As the polls in U.P. shift eastward, away from the religiously polarised western parts of the State, issues of economic delivery may become increasingly salient for voters. During the election, one tends to focus on local, nitty-gritty issues, but its important to remember that elections are won and lost on larger narratives. In this election, Mr. Yadav has built a formidable narrative as someone who can deliver benefits and public goods; it remains to be seen if this will translate to votes.Bhanu Joshi and Neelanjan Sircar are affiliated with the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) in Delhi. Ashish Ranjan, also with CPR, contributed to this article.State elections are more likely to be fought over the delivery of public goods, and these are the sort of appeals in which Akhilesh Yadav has invested"

Sidram, BJPs Sugarcane Growers Cell State unit president and former zilla panchayat member, and other leaders told presspersons here on Wednesday that Mr. Khandre had knowingly diverted over 1,300 houses under the Basava Vasati Yojane to his followers who were rich, and therefore not deserving.This is not just illegal, but immoral, Mr. Sidram said. Some of those selected by the Minister have built two- and three-storeyed houses in Bhalki and some villages, he said. He alleged that the Minister had brought unfair pressure on panchayat development officers and taluk-level officers to grant houses to his followers, though they were not fit to be beneficiaries.Mr. Sidram said that he had written to the State government and the Deputy Commissioner to investigate the matter and cancel ineligible allotments. As many as 52 deserving beneficiaries who have been left out have complained to the government, he said. If the government does not act immediately, I will lodge a complaint with the Lokayukta, he said. Tanks in Kalasdal, Ambe Sangvi and Hupla villages have breached due to heavy rain. Apart from damaging crops, the outflow washed away valuable top soil from these fields. While the Minister said that the losses amounted to Rs. 1,000 crore, officers said that it was around Rs. 198 crore. But the government is yet to compensate farmers. Nor has it taken steps to repair those tanks. If the bunds are not built in time, they cannot store water this monsoon, he said.Several poor people lost houses in the heavy rain of 2016, but Mr. Khandre had forced officers to release compensation only to Congress supporters, Mr. Sidram alleged.He also alleged that the Minister was not taking any steps to revive the sick Bidar Sahakari Sakkare Karakhane factory. Mr. Sidram accused the Minister of trying to build the district office complex in Mamankeri village, far away from the city, only to help land sharks."

Kathir said on Thursday that it was not just Muthumaris son who had been lured by the broker to work in Maharashtra...but there were similar cases in many Dalit families from Pallapatti.The government should conduct a survey of victims of the false assurance of employment in Maharashtra and send a team to rescue them.In the case of Muthumaris son, the police should immediately arrest the broker and the murukku unit proprietor Ramar.The boy, who had been under treatment for the last six months, was unable to move his left leg.

City buses stayed off the road and long-distance buses were diverted at the entrance to the city.Protests were also held in Kondanayakanahalli and Malpanagudi in support of the demand.The farmers have been demanding release of water to the Raya, Basava, Turtha and Bella canals to save sugarcane and banana cultivated in parts of Hosapete taluk.This year, due to the failure of rain, the Tungabhadra dam has gone dry and the available water is reserved for drinking water.Farmers have also been staging a dharna in front of the tahsildars office in which Vijayanagar MLA B.S.

GOVARTHANM.GOVARTHAN ;M.GOVARTHAN - M_GOVARTHANFarmers in the district have urged the State Government to permit tapping of neera from coconut and palmyra trees as in Kerala, for better value addition.Coconut growers in the Kodumudi-Modakurichi belt where the acreage of cultivation is the highest in the district and palm tree growers in and around Perundurai and other dry belts say the return on investment will be higher only if the State Government puts in place measures to streamline benefits accruing from schemes implemented by Coconut Development Board.Unlike in Tamil Nadu where neera is misconstrued as an intoxicant, Kerala and Karnataka are promoting neera as a health drink, and promoting production of the product deeming it the future of coconut sector. In Erode district, farmers are mainly into copra production and are yet to make forays into production of oil, sugar or other value added products, a Kodumudi-based farmer says.According to Logusamy, organising secretary of the district unit of Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, it will be possible for a farmer to earn as much as Rs.7,000 per palmyra or coconut tree if neera tapping is permitted by way of amending excise rules.A thrust must be accorded for neera production by way of promoting producer companies and subsidising cost of machinery, utilising funds under the Central Scheme: Technology Mission on Coconut, farmers emphasise."

I took him to the hospital and they refused to give me medicines for worth even Rs. 100. What else do I tell you about the impact of notebandi, says Kamta Prasad Verma (41), a small farmer in Padmai village of Bandas Naraini block.Demonetisation bluesThe Dalit, a Jatav, is furious with the Centre over demonetisation but is equally annoyed with the SP government for its neglect of the poor, especially during and after droughts. I am waiting to get my ration card for the last two years. Even the grains and items like oil and sugar [provided free by the Akhilesh government] are not supplied as promised. The administration eats up half, he says.Verma says he is voting for the BSP. The party candidate and incumbent MLA from the reserved seat (Naraini) is Gaya Charan Dinkar, the leader of the opposition in the Assembly and also a Jatav.It is late in the evening and Verma has come to a small kiosk near his village for a cup of tea. The shop is run by another Dalit, Manoj Kumar, 19.Manoj, who belongs to the Kori Dalit subcaste, disagrees with Verma. He supports the BJP and hopes the party fulfils its promise of providing free education to intermediate level and college-going boys and girls. Modiji works for the youth. Akhilesh also focuses on youth but my biradari is voting for BJP. Mayawati focusses too much on caste. She has taken care of goondaism but what development has she done? asks Manoj, a first-time voter.Incidentally, the BJP candidate contesting the seat, Raj Karan Kabir, belongs to his caste."

Politics of nepotism and caste will be delivered a death sentence. It will be start of the politics of performance, Mr. Shah said.Months after BJP MP Hukum Singh claimed that bad law and order situation was causing Hindus to migrate from Kairana, adjoining Muzaffarnagar, the party has vowed to constitute a special department in the police and appoint a deputy collector in every district, especially in western Uttar Pradesh, to prevent migration due to communal tension.Demography changedDue to communal tension, villages were emptied and U.P.s demography changed... Mr. Shah further said. If a government follows politics of appeasement for vote banks, it cannot give justice to all citizens, he said while claiming that once his party comes to power FIRs would be lodged within 24 hours of a person filing a complaint, without any bias.The BJP reiterated its stand on the Ram Mandir, saying it will explore all possibilities within the purview of the Constitution to construct a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.The party also referred to triple talaq, saying once in power in the State, it would push the case against it in the Supreme Court based on the opinion of Muslim women.Preservation of cowsPreservation of cows and promotion of dairy industry also featured prominently.The BJP promises to not only provide cows to landless farm labourers under the Godhan scheme but also shut down all illegal abattoirs and ban with immediate effect mechanised abattoirs in the State.Under the previous governments, there has been a fall in livestock. Due to illegal trafficking, the dairy industry is not growing in Uttar Pradesh, reads the manifesto. We want it to be like the times of Lord Krishna when rivers of milk and ghee flowed in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Shah said.The BJP also reached out to the peasant community, promising waiver of crop loans for marginal farmers, loan with zero interest rate for marginal farmers, and a system to ensure payment to sugarcane farmers within 14 days of sale and that their dues would be cleared within 120 days of the party coming to power."

Planning for the visit has been under way since Omans ruler Sultan Qaboos on March 2 nominated his cousin Sayyid Asad Bin Tariq Al Said as the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of international affairs, sources told The Hindu on Monday.The sources said the nomination of Sayyid Asad had given a clear signal that he was the most likely successor of Sultan Qaboos, who has been the ruler of the strategically located Gulf country since taking over power in a coup in 1970. Sultan Qaboos has been ailing for some years. A source familiar with the governments policy on Oman said the visit was necessary to boost bilateral ties, especially since Oman had been a steady partner of India in the region.It is true that we have moved slowly in Oman. India had set up the first bilateral infrastructure fund with Oman, but the project has not moved as fast as expected. That apart, they had asked to give them food security by signing an MoU with India for assured supplies of wheat, rice and sugar and they expressed willingness to invest in an Indian cooperative anywhere of our choosing. These options need to be pursued, said the source explaining that the agenda for the visit should take these pending issues into consideration.Strong partnershipIndia and Oman has a strong strategic partnership and Oman was one of the first Gulf countries to warm to the Modi government in the summer of 2014. Both countries formed a joint front against terrorism in October 2014. However, Mr. Modi has not visited the country, though he has been to the UAE and Saudi Arabia and has hosted the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. India had tried to host Sultan Qaboos, who was partially educated in India, as the chief guest of the Republic Day parade in 2012 but the visit could not take place. But recent trends showed a warming up in ties as Oman hosted the India-Oman Partnership Conference in Muscat on December 14, 2016, which was attended by Minister of State for External Affairs M. J. Akbar."

KrishnanIts that time of the year when Board examinations are around the corner and stress levels are peaking. Interestingly, doctors are more worried about parents whose children are gearing up for exams, especially those with diabetes.Exams are tough on parents with type-2 diabetes. Of late, our clinics have been flooded with parents coming in with stress-related issues, said A. K. Jhingan, the chairman of Delhi Diabetes Research Centre.According to Dr. Jhingan, the exam season is stressful for both children and parents. Every year during this period, we see parents with type-2 diabetes coming to us with increased blood sugar levels. Studies suggest that stress causes the body to release hormones that raise blood sugar, he explained.Struggling to copeWhat worries doctors further is the fact that children suffering from chronic stress experience phases of irritability and fatigue. This further affects parents. We have now come up with sessions to help people combat stress, Dr. Jhingan added.Dr. Anil Bansal of the Delhi Medical Association said that during the exam season diabetic parents struggle to adjust to their treatment regimen or deal with the psychosocial pressures of the disease.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), meanwhile, has decided to allow diabetic students to carry sugar tablets, chocolate, candy and water bottles inside the exam centres  a move doctors have lauded.According to Dr. Sanjay Kalra, vice-president of the South Asian Federation of Endocrine Societies, The CBSEs decision to provide a snack break during the Board examinations is welcome.Students with diabetes need a dose of insulin with each meal. If a proper meal is not consumed between the examination hours between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m., it may lead to a drop in blood sugar levels  a condition called hypoglycemia. This can lead to headaches, loss of concentration and irritability. Exam stress and hypoglycemia can cause blackouts and fainting. The CBSE has set an example and, hopefully, other Boards will follow, said Dr. Kalra."

In all his election meetings in western U.P., Mr. Adityanath said that western U.P., where Muslims constitute 25 per cent of the population, is being turned into Kashmir allegedly by forcing the Hindus to migrate from different towns.The party has tried to woo the farmers, who form the biggest vote bank in the agrarian region, by promising to waive loans of small farmers, implement several lucrative schemes for them and get sugarcane arrears paid within two weeks of coming to power in the State.The first phase would also be crucial for BSP supremo Mayawati who tried to experiment yet again with the Dalit-Muslim combination by fielding the largest number of Muslim candidates while being assured of getting the consolidated Jatav votes for the party.A major thrust of Ms. Mayawatis campaign, besides highlighting the SPs failure to maintain law and order and allow thousands of communal riots in the State, is that only she can prevent the BJP from coming to power in the State.The SP-Congress alliance has projected the vikas (development) aspect of the Akhilesh Yadav government and highlighted the negatives and ill-effects of demonetisation and the troubles it has given to the common public.The alliance has tried to woo Muslim voters by repeatedly projecting itself as the only political formation which can stop the BJP. The SP-Congress joint rallies saw display of camaraderie between Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and SPs chief Akhilesh Yadav."

When they dont, some illogical statements take birth. The other day, Parliament member from Malkajgiri, M. Malla Reddy, announced that he would reward from his pocket Rs. 25 lakh to every village if it had none from a non-TRS party. He wanted every one in villages to join TRS.He announced this on the occasion of a ZPTC member and other leaders from TDP joining the TRS in Medchal. Nothing wrong if he was trying to please the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who found the MP in the bottom three in a survey done on the winning chances of sitting MPs in the next elections in Telangana.The murmurs of the TDP cadre were quite loud who want the MP to remember that he was elected on TDP ticket, while they want him to retrospect on how much he gained by shifting his loyalty to TRS?Minister draws an interesting parallel!Minister for Agriculture Pocharam Srinivas Reddy drew an interesting parallel on the practice of determining soil health during the budget session of the Assembly last month.The Minister remarked that the present practice of issuing soil health cards was unscientific as one soil sample is collected from 10 hectares of agriculture land in case of dry land and from 2.5 hectares of wet land, even if the holdings belong to different farmers.How can the blood sample of Pocharam Srinivas Reddy reveal the health problems of his party colleagues.It only tells whether I have blood pressure, blood sugar or some other problem, the Minister said, adding that collection of one soil sample from 25 acres of land (dry) would not reveal the real problem and would not help any of the farmers cultivating that land.Instead it should be done field (plot)-wise so that the agriculture officers could suggest the exact remedy.The State government was planning to provide at least farmer-wise soil health reports in the coming years, he said.Policing to your doorstepSteps have finally been initiated to realise the goal of taking administration, including police, to the doorstep of the common man through reorganisation of districts.Six months after 21 new districts came into existence, the government, through a gazette notification, demarcated boundaries of police units right from Commissionerates to mandal-level stations.There was confusion among people on registering police complaints after the reorganisation with the prime concern being jurisdictional issues. People faced difficulties right from registering the first information report (FIR).Now that the gazette has been issued and jurisdictions of the respective police stations demarcated, people can heave a sigh of relief in approaching their nearby police stations under whose jurisdiction they come and register their FIRs.Comparing TS to NaxalbariHome Minister Nayini Narasimha Reddy drew a parallel between Naxalbari in West Bengal and Telangana while talking about Naxalism during a visit to Ramagundam as a trade union leader last week.Without going into details that the term Naxal was derived from the name of a village called Naxalbari where the movement had its origin, Mr. Reddy said struggles were inbuilt in Telangana region.Therefore, Naxalites were born here. He went on to say that the goal of the Naxalites was good, but they suffered on account of wrong decisions.Interestingly, Mr. Reddy had said after a passing out parade by trainees at National Industrial Security Academy here, months after TRS assumed power, that Naxalites were no longer there in Telangana State.- Reporting by R. Ravikanth Reddy, B. Chandrashekhar, M. Rajeev & N. Rahul"

The variety Co 6304, released in 1973, was very popular in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.During the period, it occupied 85 per cent of the area in Tamil Nadu and played a key role in making the State a top sugarcane-cultivating State.The variety Co 86032 was instrumental in making the State achieve maximum sugarcane yield per unit area. Released in 2000, it covered 70 per cent of the area in the State and over 50 per cent in Maharashtra, Karnataka and major area in Gujarat, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.At present, 99 per cent of the area under sugarcane in the country was occupied by varieties developed by the ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, the release added."

Bringing together music and concrete movements in the right context, Cinematic Movement promises to transport viewers to the world of cinema through live stage performance this Sunday at Adishakti Laboratory for Theatre Arts and Research.A chronicle of the cinematic movement, Tales of Twenty Dodgy Fingers, opens up a spectrum of dance theatre pieces, short episodes transforming the art of cinema, live on stage.Piecing together the works of two film directors from different parts of the world, this tale researches cinemas possibilities of worldness on movement art in a non-linear way, says Maya Oliva, a dance artist from Belgium.Her collaboration with Helsinki - based dance artist Karoliina Loimaala began two years ago when the two music and movie buffs set off to create a performance, influenced by Michael Maierhof  s composition Splitting 16.While watching many performances, we felt there were a lot of abstract movements and we were unable to read what was going on stage. By introducing music with concrete action, it would become more readable and accessible to the audience, she said.She added: Two years ago, we listened to Splitting 16 and found ourselves creating music with movement. We have used a non-linear way to shift between the stories of two legendary directors including Alfred Hitchcock and Hayao Miyazaki.It is the first time they are premiering the entire show. We search for deliberate ways of moving. We depart from the gestures of everyday actions. We twist them ruthlessly around, fictionalise them, butter them up, dip them in boiling sugar. We reject abstract movement without a meaning and an end, says Ms.Oliva.Tales of Twenty Dodgy Fingers will be held at 7 p.m. on Sunday, April 2 at Adishakti Laboratory for Theatre Arts and Research, Edayanchavady Road, Vanur Taluk, Auroville Post, Irumbai Panchayat, Villupuram.

Im not so sure. Whats in a name, you say? Well, the aroma, the taste, just the idea of coffee... To me, it simply wouldnt sound right if it wasnt coffee! You guessed it right. I am a coffee-lover. Not quite the connoisseur, I dont think. But my early morning perfect cuppa is at the top of the list of my favourite things.Is what I have south Indian filter kaapi ? But doesnt it look a bit like a Latte? Maybe it is drip-brewed coffee? Or perhaps it is best described as a hybrid brew, considering that I have picked up interesting ideas about coffee-brewing along the way during my travels. What makes it so perfect, you ask? Well, to be perfectly honest  me! I wouldnt trust anybody else to make me my morning nirvana brew. I do so like being my own barista.I dont just savour my coffee, you know. I also love everything that goes with the idea of coffee. I have a small collection of coffee-making apparatus: Moka pot, French press, Vietnamese Phin coffee filter, cone filter. I rarely use any of these but love just having them. For my coffee-brewing ritual every morning I use my treasured south Indian coffee filter. And yes, I love the ritual each morning, right from the sense of anticipation as I go into the kitchen to my very own coffee corner.I start by lightly heating the perforated cylindrical top cup of the steel filter to clear any clog, then place it on top of its tumbler cup, add my special ground coffee to the top cup, and pour in boiling water with care and craft. Then I wait, breathing in the aroma as the brewed decoction drips down. I transfer the dripped brew to my coffee mug; add hot foaming milk and sugar. With renewed anticipation I carry the steaming mug of coffee and sink into my cushioned corner. Then that first sip. Ah, sheer bliss. I have fond childhood memories of my mother roasting coffee beans and grinding fresh powder every night for the next morning. I remember waking up to the reassuring sound of my parents chatting over their morning coffee. When I was older I remember my mother sending me to the local coffee shop at least three times a week to get freshly roasted and ground coffee. And there were special instructions: peaberry beans, and no chicory, please. Over the years, a variety of settings have served as a backdrop for my trysts with coffee. Starbucks or Costa at airports, cozy coffee places in Italy, sweet little coffee shops in Laos, the Indian Coffee House in Bangalore, or a roadside Kumbakonam degree coffee place with its unbeatable ambience in Tamil Nadu. I just cant resist a coffee pit stop wherever I may be.Tour timeMy perennially brewing infatuation has seen me go on the Seattle Coffee Tour, spend evenings at Bangalores Coffee Santhe, and organise family holidays at coffee plantation homestays. My personal coffee supplier is from Chikmagalur, Indias coffee country. Every time I call him to place a fresh order we have pleasant coffee conversations. I also keep a look out for write-ups by coffee-lovers to bask in shared love. It is coffee, after all. You dont just drink it, do you? You experience it.A favourite daydream of mine is to own a cozy, intimate coffee place that is stacked with dog-eared books and stimulates creative intellectual conversations among a set of regulars  over endless cups of coffee, what else?What is it about coffee and me? I ask myself. The simple answer: I love coffee.shoba.raja536@gmail.com"

The State cabinet also decided to waive loans worth Rs. 6,000 crore extended to small and marginal farmers that had turned into non-performing assets. Together, this package, aimed at fulfilling the Bharatiya Janata Partys election promise, will cost the exchequer about Rs. 36,000 crore. There was no mention of a bigger plan to ramp up the farm sector, in which U.P. invested just 2.3% of total expenditure in 2016-17  one of the lowest rates across major States. A little earlier, the Madras High Court ordered the Tamil Nadu government to extend a similar farm loan waiver scheme for small farmers (with land holdings of up to 5 acres) and marginal farmers (who own up to 2.5 acres) to all farmers. Officials have even been forbidden from trying to recover loans where repayments have slipped. The State, which had already doled out Rs. 5,780 crore on this front, would need nearly Rs. 2,000 crore more to comply with the courts order. This is a worrying trend for a country that wants to double agricultural incomes by 2022. Not only could it trigger a countrywide clamour for similar debt relief packages, political parties would also be more inclined to make such grand promises ahead of future polls. This is a slippery slope with multiple unintended outcomes likely in the years to come.The Madras High Court has clearly reached into the the domain of the executive. The risk is that this overreach could be cited in other courts to seek omnibus loan waivers. Opposition parties in U.P. have already criticised the cap of Rs. 1 lakh on farm loans that will attract relief. The timing of these drastic interventions is unusual as India had a good monsoon in the 2016-17 crop season, after two years of drought, and a bumper output is expected for all major crops barring sugarcane. Forgiving loan burdens is a powerful political gesture that glosses over the fact that governments have had little patience to make agriculture a sustainable economic activity with efficient linkages to formal markets, be it for credit or for supply chains from farm gate to fork. FDI of up to 100% was allowed in food retail trading but investments are stuck over the reluctance to allow a small proportion of non-food sales. Writing off loans as a blanket policy, without scrutiny and restructuring attempts creates a moral hazard for borrowers, who will have no incentive to stick to credit discipline. Frequent write-offs will prod banks to invest in alternatives such as the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund instead of reaching out to individual farmers to meet their agricultural lending targets. In which case, usurious local moneylenders could have a field day."

This alarming diagnosis by city doctors came on Thursday, the eve of World Sleep Day (WSD). Observed on March 17, the day looks at important sleep-related issues.Good sleep plays a critical role in overall well-being and protecting one against cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity to boosting neurocognitive functions, mental health and longevity, according to doctors.But whats keeping the Capital awake?Stress, the need to stay connected all the time, chasing targets and deadlines, noise pollution, extensive travel time, night shifts and very limited time for self are the a main culprits behind this, said Vinit Banga, Department of Neurology, Institute of Human and Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS).Quality of lifeDelhi has become a 24x7 city. Delhiites are simply not allowing themselves to relax and work towards having a good quality seven to eight hour sleep. We are forcing ourselves to staying awake longer and longer to have a better quality of life, little realising that the quality of life suffers irreversibly if you dont sleep well, he said.Sandeep Nayar, the HOD of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Sleep Disorders at BLK Super Speciality Hospital said: Among the healthy population, stress is the primary culprit thats keeping the city awake. Delhi youngsters are sleep-deprived these days owing to personal and professional stress. Most importantly, stress is not letting people have quality and undisturbed sleep. A healthy person who manages to sleep uninterrupted for five hours will wake up feeling feel fresh. Keeping television, laptop and other electronic items in the bedroom must be avoided at all cost as these affect sleep. Also, eating right is very important for mental peace.Sleep disordersDoctors noted that more and more people in the city, even the world, are battling sleep disorders. In fact, recent studies have shown that the ill-effects of this condition are far more complex and dangerous.According to Delhi Diabetes Research Centre chairperson Ashok Jhingan: Sleep apnoea is like a triad. A disturbed sleep pattern leads to disturbed eating pattern which then leads to health problems. All three cause hypertension, high blood sugar and heart problems. Its a vicious circle.Sleep apnoeaMore sleep apnoea leads to more health issues and this leads to joint pain, gallbladder diseases and heart problems. Sleep apnoea is a lifestyle disorder. Change your lifestyle before sleep apnoea changes you, he added.Several meta-analysis have suggested a close link between patients who suffer from obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and hypertension. Sleep apnoea is characterised as a sleep disorder in which a person has disrupted sleep, which leads to snoring and/or shallow breathing.While sleep apnoea hampers a persons lifestyle and leads to low productivity, its largely left untreated because of its slow impact. However, recent studies suggest that untreated sleep apnoea could be one of the primary reasons behind an aggravated case of hypertension.Sleep apnoea is one of the most ignored health conditions. While many are simply unaware, others who are aware of their disorder usually are not informed about the severe consequences of untreated sleep apnoea.People who let this condition remain unchecked are four times more at the risk of a stroke and three times more at the risk of developing a heart disease. Its also linked to a host of serious health conditions like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, increased weight gain, cardiac arrhythmias, heart attack, heart failure, memory impairment, premature ageing and even sudden death.K. K. Aggarwal of Indian Medical Association said: Untreated obstructive apnoea often results in high blood pressure, which can lead to an increase in heart size. This leads to higher risk of heart attacks and strokes.Atrial fibrillationPeople with sleep apnoea run the risk of higher chances cardiac arrhythmias, most common of which is atrial fibrillation. Lifestyle habits, which play an important role, can be managed effectively. Alcohol, smoking and some medications increase muscle relaxation, allowing the flesh of the throat to relax and disrupt airflow. Smoking also irritates the nasal passages and throat muscles, causing inflammation of these areas and restricting airflow, he added.Difficult to predictDoctors, however, added that its difficult to predict the stage at which a disease could become the breeding ground for other diseases. While its comparatively easy to manage a lifestyle disease by effecting changes in your daily routine, living with co-morbidities is highly challenging. Two things need to be prioritised in such a scenario  limiting high-calorie food and the tendency to obsess and limit food. Youngsters in the city too arent untouched by sleep-related issues.Sleeping patternsSamir Parikh of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare added: For a majority of teenagers today, waking up in time every morning has become one of the biggest hurdles. Despite being aware that their bodies need at least seven to nine hours of sleep per day, many students forego precious hours of sleep. They exhibit erratic sleeping patterns and get less sleep due to late night chats on their mobiles, checking their handsets in the middle of the night, spending time on social media, watching movies or using laptops to browse the Internet late into the night."

One of the card holders, a journalist, contacted the higher officials of the Department of Cooperation and informed him of the development.During the enquiry, we found that the woman, who was acting as the saleswoman, had been appointed by the salesman who allowed her to make entries in the point of sale machine and handle cash, said one of the affected cardholders.Enquiries with the gypsies of Poonga Nagar, who are getting essential commodities from the same shop, revealed that they could not buy anything from the shop for the past six months.When Cheranmahadevi Sub-Collector V. Vishnu came to know that the services of some unemployed, computer-literate women were utilised by a few officials of Radhapuram taluk office, he sent the women out after issuing a stern warning to the officials.Now, these jobless women had been appointed for a paltry sum as wages by a few ration shop salesmen for operating point of sale machine, the card holders said.Admitting that allowing strangers to handle cash and make entries in point of sale machine were illegal, District Supplies Officer Punniyakotti said the e-illiterate salesmen, who had appointed these women, had been warned.Weve also replaced these women with substitutes. Senior salesmen, who are struggling to operate point of sale machine, are being trained once again. Some of the salesmen, who had gone on leave due to personal reasons, had also appointed these women. They have also been warned and substitute salesmen posted there to enable them to go on leave with prior permission, Mr. Punniyakotti said."

Veera Raghava Rao said at the farmers grievance meeting here on Friday.He added that the number of farmers affected by drought had been ascertained as 89,830. The detailed enumeration exercise covered 618 of the 645 villages in the district, excluding those coming under urban areas.Mr. Rao said that the list of affected farmers and the survey numbers would be made public and anyone who had been excluded could approach the respective Village Administrative Officer or other designated official with appropriate documents for verification and inclusion in the list. The Collector also said that bank account details of nearly all the affected farmers had been collected so that the compensation amount could be directly credited to their account.Farmers, however, expressed concern that the list only included those farmers who had crop failure but excluded those who had to leave their land barren owing to drought. Since, there was no rainfall and no water supply in the Periyar-Vaigai system, many farmers did not even undertake sowing. It remains a concern whether they will be provided compensation, said N. Palanichamy, president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, a view echoed by other farmers in the meeting.Responding to the issue, Mr. Rao assured that as of now the government wanted the list of farmers who had yield loss. However, we will recommend to the government that even those who did not sow should be compensated, he said.Farmers also raised concern over the announcement made earlier by the State government, in relation to the drought, to convert all crop loans from cooperative banks to medium-term loans. M. Pandian, a farmer, said that there had been no clarity on whether the farmers would be eligible for fresh loans.If it is converted to medium-term, the loan will still be open. We do not want it to make us ineligible for a fresh loan in the next farming season. Moreover, will the scheme be applied to farmers with more than five acres of land, he questioned.Officials, however, said that there would be clarity on the scheme only after specific instructions were received from the government.Recurrent issues of the long pending request for de-silting Vaigai dam, wild boar menace in areas like Usilampatti and Peraiyur and removal of seemai karuvelam trees also dominated the grievance meeting.

Gangulys response was sharp. He said, This you do every season.At first, Gangulys comment appeared casual for Parthiv. Then the enormity of what the celebrated Indian captain said hit him. What he meant was I should not be content with what I was doing, needed to do something out of the ordinary to win back my place in the Indian squad, Parthiv said in a conversation with The Hindu here recently.The wicketkeeper-batsman realised he needed to shed weight, improve his glovework and begin dominating the bowling.I then underwent a rigorous morning-to-evening training and practice schedule in the Motera Stadium. I would do stringent fitness routines, practise my keeping and then work on my batting, he said.Parthiv realised that his mistakes as a keeper, most of them in the last session of the day, were not due to any faulty technique.My fitness levels were not quite there and this affected my concentration in the final session where I put down catches, he admitted.The left-handed Parthiv, to whom the cut, pull and sweep come naturally, faced difficulties when bowlers, comprehending his game, pitched the ball up.I worked on my drives through mid-off and mid-on, often practising alone with the bowling machine.The diminutive Parthiv, who shed 10kg coming down to 65 from 75, also dieted, cutting out on fat and sugar.Every three weeks, he would travel to Chennai to get himself assessed by strength and conditioning guru S. Basu.Gradually, Parthiv turned the corner.The results came slowly but when they did, I was a better cricketer.Parthiv returned to the Indian team against England this season  he batted and kept more than usefully  and then led Gujarat to a historic maiden Ranji title. All the effort had paid off.He recalled India coach Anil Kumble knocking on his door on the eve of the Mohali Test and telling him You are going to open tomorrow, I know you can do it.Reassuring wordsParthiv said, Anil Bhais words were so reassuring since I was playing a Test after eight years.The 31-year-old Parthiv responded with innings of 42 and 67 not out at Mohali and then made a strokeful 71 in Chennai  all as an opener.When Parthiv first played for India in 2002 in England, it was in a different era. Sachin Sir, Dravid Sir, Ganguly Sir, Laxman Sir and Anil bhai, they were all there.The first few days I would observe one legend a day from my corner in the dressing room, just see how he went about his work.Old bonds continue and Dravid and Laxman call Parthiv up these days too, offering words of encouragement.Youve got to give credit to Parthiv. He kept the fire burning and slogged it out.There is no success without sweat.I would do stringent fitness routines, practise my keeping and then work on my battingParthiv Patel"

Mr. Sukumaran said that farmers used to pack harvested grains in gunny bags but the current drought and crop loss has resulted in the gunny bags turning into body bags for farmers who ended their lives or died of shock at the daunting debt due to agricultural loss.Instead of attending to the farmers' problems, the Central Government has given the nod for natural gas exploration in Pudukkottai district which if allowed would have negative impact on the neighbouring Thanjavur district also, the farmers said as they staged a walk out.Then another group of farmers, including district vice-president of the Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Thozhilalar Sangam V. Jeevakumar, Delta Farmers Association district president A. K. R. Ravichandar, Sugar Cane Growers Association secretary Thozhagiripatti P. Govindaraj knotted a noose around their neck and besieged Collector A. Annadurai who was chairing the meeting.The farmers alleged that Karnataka was trying to take advantage of the fluid political situation in Tamil Nadu and moving things to construct a reservoir at Mekedatu across Cauvery River and prevent whatever little water Tamil Nadu was getting now.If that is allowed, then Delta would turn into a desert and farmers would have lost their livelihoods. The Centre and the State governments must act fast and prevent that from happening. To highlight the situation wherein more farmers were ready to end their lives we have come to the meeting with the noose around our neck, they stated.The farmers also wondered on the Central drought assessment team's visit as nothing tangible has emerged so far. The meagre amount announced by the State Government as relief has also not materialised, they alleged."

One can open an online account, by registering with the website the details such as number of ration card, mobile phone, and Aadhaar. Aimed at about 1.91-crore rice-drawing cards, the give it up option covers not only rice, sugar, toor dhal, urad dhal and wheat but also the Pongal gift pack.Meanwhile, since November [when the Act came into force] there have been complaints of non-availability of rice or irregular supply of rice, even though officials in charge of fair price shops (FPS) are bound under the NFSA to ensure the provision of five kg of rice per month per person. The policy of the State government is supply rice free of cost. A housewife, whose card is with a FPS in Kamarajapuram, near Tambaram, says, If you do not visit your shop within the first week, you will not get any thing from the ration. Pointing out that there is no such government rule, T. Sadagopan, president of the Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumers Centre, says that if and when rice is available, FPS officials would ordinarily give greater quantity of boiled rice than raw rice. A beneficiary, attached to FPS in Ram Nagar, Velachery, says even though his card has four members, he is being given only 15 kg rice against his quota of 20 kg as per the law. Besides, out of the 15 kg, the quantity of raw rice is five kg. There are also complaints that those who have not obtained any commodity have received messages on their mobile phones that billing has been done against their cards.The government, early this month, issued an order allowing the rice cardholders to get certain amount of wheat free of cost in lieu of rice. This has been done as the allocation of wheat for the State is 1.62 lakh tonnes out of the total annual allocation of 36.78 lakh tonnes, according to the government order. A senior official in the Food Department says the give it up drive has been prepared mainly to address the problem of bogus billing. On receiving the complaints of bogus billing, the officials of the shops have been strictly warned. Several punishment measures are being contemplated, he says, adding that people can send complaints of bogus billing to 9980904040 by typing PDS (space) 107.Another official says the concept of no commodity cards has been in vogue for many years. As for the complaints on non-availability of rice or irregular supply of rice, a system is in place to monitor the movement of rice. Wherever rice is required, we are moving the stock, the official says."

In fact, authentic sushi is hard to find.Its origin was functional. Salted fish stored in vinegar rice could last for months and supply adequate amount of protein. The contemporary versions of the dish do not resemble its predecessor Nare-Zushi.Today in India we find tandoori sushi, palak paneer sushi and many other Indian varieties of it, laughs the specialty chef, Boonlurah Panchai, of Leela Palace Bengaluru.He has curated a sushi festival in Zen Leela Palace, which will commence on March 6, and serve traditional sushi rolls and sashimi platter. City Express catches up with the chef to trace sushis evolution and his journey with it.Where are you from and how is the dish like in your country?I am from Thailand and sushi is well-loved there. When I went to Thailand five years ago and there were about 9,700 sushi restaurants. I am sure now it must have crossed 10,000 now.Few little known facts about sushi?Sushi originated in Japan but the style of it was popularized in Korea. Sushi is actually meant to be served with raw fish but the stigma of eating raw is deep in some countries. That is why we have different inventions and people opt for cooked or boiled ingredients.The traditional sushi has rice, vinegar, salt, sugar, cucumber, Japanese radish and raw fish. Sushi travelled to America and it is now called California Roll. There is also something called a Crazy Roll, sushi that people thought had a crazy taste.When and how did you come to India? What have you learnt here?I started my career in the year 1999 in Thailand and I was sent to India on work. I worked in Delhi Leela Palace and moved to Bengaluru about three years ago. I think I sharpened my chef skills more in India because Indians like ordering dishes that are off the menu.Also, in India people do not order much variety. When a friend recommends a dish to a friend or a relative, they try that out.What is different about sushi in India?Authentic sushi is actually bland in flavour but because India loves spices, we serve spicy sushi here and it does really well with the Indian customers.What is something that is new in the second edition of your sushi festival?There is something I have experimented with. It is a sushi dessert called Frushi that is made with sushi and fruits. It took me three days to get the dish right.What do you recommend to people who are tasting sushi for the first time?There are three stages of sushi. First is Maki that is the roll, then there is Nigiri which is semi-cooked and Sashimi which is fully raw. I recommend people start with Maki."

With 89 seats at stake across 14 districts in the sixth and seventh phases on March 4 and 8 respectively, the BJPs campaign , led by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has shifted to a higher gear and refused to back down on demonetization after a couple of weeks of being on the defensive.And on the other hand, the Samajwadi Party (SP) is defending this turf without the active involvement of Mulayam Singh Yadav in his own constituency of Azamgarh where it won nine out the 10 Assembly seats in 2012. Indeed in the overall region, the, SP had then swept this region, winning 50 out of the 89 seats and. The last stretch is therefore likely to be a trial of Akhilesh Yadavs acceptance among the masses.For Narendra Modi, the gentle spin given to the GDP numbers by the Central Statistical Organisation has been timely as he revs up the BJP campaign in a region with a higher proportion of the upper caste vote. The fact that the pangs of demonetization have begun to ease and queues at ATMS have ceased is working to the advantage of the BJP while blunting Akhileshs criticism of demonetation.On the other hand, the challenge for the Samajwadis is stiffer as the party is facing a strong anti-incumbency sentiment in this region.The SP government has not done enough in eastern UP despite having won a huge mandate from this region. The party has disappointed its voters across these 14 districts which are grappling with a number of issues, says a prominent political scientist.The government did restart a sugar mill in Azamgarh but that is discounted because it happens to be Mulayams constituency. Azamgarh is a VIP constituency, so its voters have an edge over others, says Lal Bihari Mritak, chief of Mritak Sangh (Deadmen Association).Eastern UP is basically a region dominated by places of religious importance: Gorakhnath Peeth in Gorakhpur and Varanasi are holy places for the majority community, while districts like Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Mau and Deorai have a chunk of Muslim population. The religious significance of the region is reiterated by the influence of saffron leaders like Yogi Adityanath, who claims to hold sway over 62 of the 89 seats going to polls in the last two phases.Communal polarization promoted by figures like Yogi Adityanath is coming in handy for the saffron partys final stretch strategy, with the PM himself making much of kabristans and such like.While Muslim voters play a key role in Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Mau, Jaunpur and Varanasi, the role of non-Yadav OBCs and MBCs, who are dominant in some pockets, can also be a deciding factor in the last two phases, says JP Shukla, a political analyst. Keeping in view the backward caste demography, the BJP has spared a substantial 20 Assembly constituencies in the last two phases to its allies  Anupriya Patel-led Apna Dal and Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Suhel Dev Bharatiya Samaj Party. Apart from those 20 seats, the two NDA allies are likely to play a crucial role in attracting Kurmis and most backward classes to the BJP fold.With the SP-Congress alliance banking on the Muslim-Yadav combination in and around Azamgarh district, the BSPs ploy to merge the Quami Ekta Dal (QED) of the Ansari brothers will be put to test here. How far will QED be able to consolidate Muslim-Dalit voters in Behenjis favour is another interesting aspect to be noticed. The Ansaris are said to have a direct impact on 20-odd seats in andaround their den."

The flame of communal tension, which began in Bulandshahr, has now reached Lakhimpur Kheri in Terai.There was a flare-up in Kehri after an objectionable video featuring gods and goddesses went viral on Thursday. Two persons were injured in skirmishes that followed and two main accused were held by the police. Lakhimpur Kheri is still under the curfew with a relaxation of three hours.Western UP has always been considered as a communally sensitive region, especially after the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 and Dadri mob lynching in 2015.The manner in which a series of minor incidents took communal overtones in a recent couple of days is an indication that all is not well in the States sugar bowl.Since February 25, just before the fifth phase of polling, even small scuffles and altercations have brought the two communities face-to-face a number of times.The emergent post-poll scenario in the west, which remained relatively silent when the region went to vote, is sending not-so-good signals and is keeping the administration on its toes.Very much on the lines of Lakhimpur Kheri, a video showing a man using objectionable language against gods and goddesses also emerged in Bulandshahr.The clip went viral and triggered clashes in which three people were injured. The atmosphere in Muzaffarnagar was so charged with a communal passion that a minor altercation between a Dalit and a Muslim youth spiralled into an ugly scenario, with members from both communities indulging in stone pelting.Top cops in the State are seeing a design to the flare-ups and suspect a conspiracy. There were a couple of incidents when pieces of meat, probably of a bovine, were found outside a temple and at a farm, leading to tension, said a senior IPS officer, suspecting a conspiracy."

This is because he started on gardening, in earnest, after working with an NGO in Gudalur, Nilgiris.The NGO is trying to revive the adivasis traditional systems of medicine. Rajeev learnt from their healers and took walks with adivasi children through villages, identifying and listing plants and trees. I came back to the city and found the best resource in Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Traditions, in Bengaluru, he says. They have the biggest repository and I could get the most unusual plants from them.He had started collecting herbal plants. I realised Amruthaballi is one of the best medicines to treat flu-like symptoms, he says. You cut a twig, boil it in milk and add some sugar to it. He began using pomegranate to treat diarrhoea and many varieties for tulasis to treat various ailment. Drumstick leaves are the best cure for anaemia.Rajeev has all of these in a garden spread across his terrace, balcony and the ground floor where there is enough light.He finds it very difficult to pick a favourite plant. Maybe, recently the rosemary, says Rajeev. I used to think it is exotic but realised that it grows really fast in two to three months. I use it in every food I eat these days. Then I love Indian Labarnum yellow is my favourite colour and when the tree blooms it is like gold. When I was doing my masters, one of the inroads of the hospital campus was lined with these trees that made a yellow carpet in spring.Rajeev says it is just as difficult to name a plant he would never grow. Probably thorny plants, but that is because I have a nephew and I am scared he will hurt himself during play, he says.The gardener has been trying to get the Kandyan Dancer, an orchid. Orchids are native species, infact many varieties are from the Western Ghats, Northeast India and Himachal Pradesh. The Kandyan Dancer is from Sri Lanka though. he says. I like it because there is a dance form in the country that resembles it it shows how our cultural life is closely linked to Nature.He misses the time when every house in Bengaluru had planned gardens. There was lemon trees and coriander in the backyard near the kitchen, mango and guava in the front yard where children play, he says. Every house had a gooseberry tree and, in my house, we had spent hours climbing and plucking berries from it."

The trigger is the decisive mandate the party got in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Sensing the pro-poor electoral constituencys disenchantment with the Congress and regional parties, the BJP is going the extra mile to sugar-coat all of its initiatives as measures to help the poor overcome their socio-economic backwardness.The Centre-ruling partys national executive meeting has come back to Odisha after a gap of two decades. The saffron party substantially closing the gap with the Biju Janata Dal, that is ruling the State, in the recent panchayat elections seems to be worrying Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. With Odisha Assembly elections due in 2019, the saffron party is already showing signs of emerging as a challenger to the BJDs hegemony in the State.Odisha will become the laboratory of pro-poor initiatives of the NDA government at the Centre, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. The two-day conclave, he added, would lay down the roadmap for the Assembly elections and Lok Sabha polls in 2019.The focus of the meeting would be the Prime Minister, that is the trend now under party chief Amit Shah, said sources.However, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to be the show-stopper. In his limited time in office, Yogi has managed to attract the attention of other BJP Chief Ministers, say sources.The BJP is looking to expand in Odisha, West Bengal, Telangana and Tripura. These are the new catchment areas for the party and we want to reach the top slot in these States in a very quick time. Therefore, every occasion would be utilised to project the Prime Minister as a messiah of the poor, beamed a party functionary.Even though the Presidential elections are just a couple of months away, the meeting would give it a miss, the sources added. Interestingly, to cobble up numbers for the Presidential elections, Shah has asked Adityanath and Manohar Parrikar  Chief Ministers of UP and Goa  not to resign from their MP post. Yogis deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya will also follow suit."

We ask people not just to avoid such food habits, but stop them for the sake of their health.Medical practitioners say children, pregnant women, senior citizens and those with health issues should take extra care during summer. Children usually prefer cold carbonated drinks available in markets. But we advise parents to not encourage children to consume such cool drinks. Instead, parents should buy ORS drinks available in flavours for their children, said Dr Sumithra, a pediatrician.The circular also mentions that it is better to avoid spicy foods, drinks with high sugar content, caffeinated drinks, carbonated and soda mixed drinks and instead drink water, fruit juices or water mixed with sugar and salt.Dr Lakshmi Kulkarni, a general physician, said, Drink lots of water and eat fruits and vegetables.

We discuss below the various manifestations of diabetes on the eye.Blurred vision: The lens in the eye helps us focus on objects, this is very similar to what happens in a camera.In people with very high blood sugar the lens could swell and can affect the ability to see.Treatment: To correct this one needs to get the blood sugars back in to the target range (70-130 milligrams per decilitre, or mg/dL, before meals, and less than 180 mg/dL 1 to 2 hours after a meal). It might be three months before the vision returns to normal.Cataracts: Common symptoms include blurring and glare during the early stages and in the later stage inability to see.Treatment: Surgery to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial one.Diabetic Retinopathy: If not identified and treated earlier, leads to irreversible blindness.Treatment: Tight control of blood sugars requiring treatment with multiple daily insulin injection or delivery of insulin via an insulin pump will help stop any further deterioration.Glaucoma: Symptoms include headache, pain behind the eyes, watering, halos around lights, holes in the vision and vision loss.Treatment:A full eye check up on a yearly basis is necessary for all diabetic patients to identify these problems early and enable appropriate treatment.If diabetic women are planning to get pregnant it is important that their blood sugar control is optimal and should have a full examination of their eyes before they conceive.Pregnant diabetic women are at higher risk for development of eye complications of previously existing eye problems during the course of pregnancy and should therefore have their eyes checked every three months."

But the launch of Sugar and Spice, a collection of Kanjivaram pattu pavadais (fabric lengths) from Kanakavalli and jewellery from Ahalya, paved the way for tiny tots and some grownups to revisit thebygone era.(Left) Latha Subramaniam, and storyteller Sandhya Ruban (right) at the sessionAs balloons, lights, music and the playful banters of children filled the century old Kingsely bungalow on Spurtank Road, Ahalya points to the collection as a revival-of-sorts and says, The Kanjivaram pavadai has been around for ages. But the pavadai has lost out because the aesthetics of people wanting to dress up their children in pavadais was different from what was being produced.With most brands and lines catering to Disney-inspired clothing for children, Ahalya opines that Kanjivaram gives an identity to the person who wears it but it needs to evove with the times. A revival is not a revival if it doesnt go on to live in the long run, she says, The thavani has already gone out of the chart. No teenager wears it anymore as its the sari that they feel gives them a certain aesthetic. So, the pavadai has been revived, but its here to stay!What better way to launch a collection than to soak in stories and myths about weaves? Sandhya Ruban, a storyteller, with expertise in body eloquence and biblical telling, kept the crowd  a mix of children and adults  at their alert best. With weaving myths from Greece, Japan and India filling the lawn, Sandhya shares, Silk started here almost 4,000 years ago and weaving has been the common strand across the Eastern part of the world. I wanted to narrate stories that will give something for the children to take back home.The spider spinning its own web has been a unique motif commonly associated with weaving and spinning looms. In some myths, weaving is shown as a token of gratitude.man wore no clothes and it was given as a gift, she explains. There are several myths like that and I had to research a lot on these folk tales, textile history and so on to create an impact. My aim was for the children to have a strong connection with the word weaving when they head back, she smiles.As one group was busy and engrossed in the storytelling session, another group was meticulously folding sheets of coloured papers while taking cues from the stories narrated by Latha Subramaniam. Peter and Paul made Mud Mountain on the beach, she says and simultaneously folds a pre-creased paper in the shape of a mountain. As the story goes forwardit ends with, When they turned and looked around, there was a boat and by now the paper has taken the shape of a boat  welcome to the art of storygami! This is quite new to the city. As a storygami artist, I stumbled across the art by chance!she grins.When Ruth Stotter, a famous storyteller from California visited the city for a session of storygami, she wanted an interpreter who could translate her instructions to Tamil and thats how Lathas journey began. Our association grew and she introduced me to storygami. Imagine making your own stories, and at the same time creating objectsits a unique method to make children become more expressive, she shares. Its very interactive and gives a chance to everyone. You really dont have to be good at crafts to do stroygami. If you have the love to listen and build stories, thats more than enough!Crafting a story and shaping a paper might sound easy, but there arent many takers in the city. Even for me, it was a new concept; so Chennai still has a long way to go in storygami. But once we get there, we can create a new process of learning  simple and fun, she adds."

The slums dotting across the city have turned the veritable underbelly of the dangerous substance trade with the youths getting hooked to the kick and many getting trapped to carry out peddling.Areas such as Haldipadia, Salia Sahi, Mali Sahi, Phuleswari Basti, Patia and Shikharchandi slum in the city have become major centres for brown sugar, adulterated cough syrup and other synthetic drugs.Adulterated brown sugar available in the city has become a substitute for the more expensive cocaine. The drug has become a rage as it is cheap. One can get a gram of brown sugar for `700-`1000 while good quality cocaine costs upwards of `5000 per gram, the officer added.Curiosity, kick and fun are some of the factors that pull the first-timers till they get hooked to it. By the time they recover to the trap, it is too late. Most of my customers are youngsters. One of my regular customers is a college student who comes with his friends in a car, said Shaikh, a peddler.Meanwhile, police have intensified enforcement against drug peddlers in the last six months. Over 28 cases under NDPS Act have been registered with 49 arrests. During 2016-17, 634.50 grams of brown sugar were seized in the Capital City. A major challenge before the police is that any addict is a potential drug peddler.The moment a drug addict falls short of resources to finance his drug consumption, he either resorts to commit a crime like snatching or gets engaged in drug peddling with a considerable commission for his service, Police Commissioner Yogesh Bahadur Khurania said.Sources said the Commissionerate of Police has already tracked the sources of drug supply into the city. A woman based in Balasore is the kingpin of the racket. She sources drugs from West Bengal and routes it to Bhubaneswar. However, the network operates on phone and none of members have any knowledge of the whereabouts or identity of their upper link.In order to book a person under the NDPS Act, he or she must be in possession of the contraband which does not occur in the case of the mastermind here.However, the person is under surveillance and will be arrested soon, the officer added."

The corporation said it had invited four tenders for Jaya and Matta since January, and procured 5.6 and 5.4 quintals, respectively.The shortage is compensated by procuring Jaya from Gujarat and Jharkhand, and boiled rice from the FCI. Moreover, Oil Palm India is providing Kuttanadan Matta at Rs 33.The increase in sugar price is the result of the recent slump in sugarcane production, due to draught.

Thinking up resolutions for the same is an activity most people engage in, but come February and March, people begin to falter and the promises made to themselves start to crumble. This may have even become a New Year routine! Lets try and change the situation here. Here are a few health resolutions you can make and stick to easily throughout the year.Lose WeightThis is among the most common resolutions. Dont just make a vague resolution and leave it at that. Go and consult your doctor and a dietician. The doctor will make sure you have no health issues that could get aggravated by certain diets. And the dietician will take all factors into account, including your doctors report and your current lifestyle and advise you a personalised diet plan. The dietician will also craft it in such a way that you will find it easy to stick to it with your work schedule.Quit SmokingAgain, dont just make a resolution and leave it at that. Take the next step and seek professional help. A doctor can guide you through the process and make it easier for you to stick to your resolution. She can prescribe nicotine substitutes or patches as she feels is necessary based on your individual profile, and monitor your progress.Get activeJoin a gym, a yoga class, start running or swimming! Just get up and get going! Try it all and see what suits your health and temperament. But remember to get a health check up done beforehand to rule out any issues that may aggravate with any intense exercise.Eat more fruits and vegetablesNow this is easier to stick to then keeping to a diet. If you dont need to lose weight, then this is the perfect resolution to make for a healthier you in this year.Drink less alcoholModeration is the key here. We all know that excess alcohol is harmful to the body. But some people tend to find excuses that its just one more drink. Some also give the reason that they have to attend corporate parties where they need to drink in company. In such cases, switch to sugar-free soft drinks or fresh fruit juices instead. These are healthier and will go a long way in keeping you and your liver healthy.Get a health check upIf you are above 40 years of age, then its time you go in for an annual check-up. Monitoring basic parameters like blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar will go a long way in ensuring you stay healthy lifelong. Regular check-ups will help catch any problem early on when it is easy to treat and control.So go ahead and amend those resolutions! Ensure you sincerely act on them without fail in the coming year. These will then become your permanent habits.Dr G N RameshSr Consultant Gastroenterologist,Aster Medcity"
58fce8877be9e06c93711011,Businessman has constructed his factory using bamboo and mud,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/jan/11/businessman-has-constructed-his-factory-using-bamboo-and-mud-1558289.html,2017-01-11,"BENGALURU: Can a blade of grass replace steel? Yes, says 38-year-old Bengalurean Babu K Iyer. This businessman, who makes and sells bamboo furniture, has also made his entire factory building from bamboo and mud bricks.There are varieties of bamboo that are stronger than mild steel (the steel used for construction), he says. The steel has a strength of 23,000 psi (or the weight it can take per square inch) while a particular variety of bamboo, called Guadua Angustifolia, has a tensile strength of 28,000 psi. The bamboo is therefore called the vegetable steel.Babu started his bamboo business Bamboo Pecker in 2009, and then he was making furniture, now he also consults for construction using bamboo.Midnight HuntHis love for the grass started way back in 1998. Babu was on the lookout for wild lampshades for a function and his search lasted till 12:30 in the night to get one piece. Babu realised that bamboo products are difficult to locate. Babu, who had tried his hand at various businesses, decided there is a market for bamboo furniture.When he started, his friend and an architect suggested that he build at his factory also from bamboo. Babu went along with it and had his first bamboo office and workspace in 2009. But that building was razed, he says, by the landlord and without a notice.In 2015, one of his customers gave him land to reconstruct the factory, near KR Puram, and Babu decided to stick to the green side. There were 22 eucalyptus trees in the plot, he says, we made a plan that keeps all of them standing... there are two or three trees inside the work area. This time too, the factory was made from mud bricks and bamboo. It has a work area, store room, Babus office, treatment facility, toolroom and space for employees to stay.Age-old TechniqueSusanth CS, Senior Designer and Head of Center for Bamboo Initiatives, has seen the growth of Bamboo Pecker from the beginning. He calls Babus construction method very good and hopes more people will follow his example. His factory has even withstood few monsoons without a problem, says Susanth, most people worry that mud walls will not withstand the rains. But mud has been used for a long time in this country.The design expert says that, while there are other bamboo-based constructions in the city, Bamboo Peckers is different because it uses no or minimal concrete. I have used concrete only in my office and in the work area, says Babu. It was to build the raised foundation to keep water from seeping in. But this concrete too was sourced from waste at a nearby construction site. We crushed the waste and seived it, and used mostly the mud from it, says Babu.Breathing WallsBricks were made from mud that is dug out at various construction sites. We mixed that mud with crushed rock and a fermented solution of jaggery, lime and kadukka (or Terminalia Nebula) for the mixture and then left it in the mould to dry in the sun, says Babu. The bricks are not compressed or baked. This is a method that has been used since time immemorial, even for dams like the Mullaperiya dam... I am willing to wager anything that bamboo was used as reinforcement in the dam, says Babu.A small mud house that breathes. In a closed concreted room, your breath bounces back from the wall... but in this factory, the mud walls filter the air because it is porous, he says.1,000 Shoots from OneBamboo is one of the most sustainable materials because it regenerates quickly. You cut from a tree and then it takes 20 years for another tree to grow in its place, says Susanth. But from one plant, you can get atleast a 1,000 culms.Bamboo grows in multitudes when planted, says Babu. In a year, a bamboo plant can give five to six shoots. When the seeds are planted, they take time to adjust to the soil condition... once they have, there is no stopping the grass growth.While all this -- the eco-friendliness and near perennial nature of the grass  sounds good, the stumbling block is in its availability. The material is cheap but sourcing it is expensive and time consuming, says Babu. You need the forest departments permit to cut even privately grown plants, then you need a permit to transport them, then you need a record of your storage and if you want to move the stock, you need to apply for other permits.Babu is part of a group that promotes the use of bamboo. It is difficult for me, despite being part of this council and a businessman... sourcing bamboo would be a headache for a common man, he says.Invisible GodsThere is always the threat of fungal infection and pest attack with the grass that belongs to the sugarcane family. There is sugar in the stem and pest, which lay eggs in the stem, tend to stay on for the food or sugar, says Babu. They flood the interiors of the plant... They are called the invisible gods because they are everywhere and we dont know where they come from. Babu has a treatment system that breaks their food chain.The cut bamboo sticks are treated using a method called Boric Borax. This involves use of a salt, milder than cooking salt, that is mixed with water and then allowed to penetrate through the inner walls of the bamboo culms, cutting pests off from their sugar foods.(Inputs from Rakshnna Pattabiraman)"

He did not name anyone as responsible for his daughters death.

Also, district Collectors have been directed to submit detailed reports on the other deaths reported so far, many of them ostensibly due to drought and resultant crop loss.According to the disaster relief guidelines, farmers who faced a yield loss above 33 percent would get relief assistance. For paddy and other irrigated crops, Rs 5,465 per acre would be given, while Rs 3,000 would be given to rain-fed and mulberry crops. Similarly, for long-term crops, Rs 7,287 would be given per acre.Since farmers who had insured their crops could claim insurance, crop cutting experiment to estimate crop yield rates would be completed soon. Since relief alone is possible as per the disaster guidelines, the State government had already insured the crops and had paid Rs 410 crore towards premium for crop insurance during the current year, a statement said.Farmers who had incurred 100 percent crop loss in paddy cultivation would receive compensation ranging from Rs 21,500 to Rs 26,000 per acre from insurance companies depending on the district.For delta districts, Rs 25,000 could be claimed for 100 percent loss of crops; Rs 20,000 for 80 per cent crop loss; Rs 15,000 for 60 per cent crop loss; and Rs 8,250 for 33 per cent crop loss. For other districts, compensation would be paid to those farmers who had incurred above 33 percent crop loss. Similarly, farmers in each district would get the insurance claim specified for the respective districts.The claims differ from crop to crop  Rs 50,000 for turmeric, Rs 45,000 for sugarcane, Rs 20,000 for maize and Rs 12,000 for pulses per acre would be given.To provide employment opportunities to agricultural labourers who have been affected by drought, the number of working days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme would be increased from 100 days to 150 days. Besides, works like desilting lakes, ponds and canals would be undertaken at a cost of Rs 3,400 crore.The Chief Minister said to mitigate the scarcity of fodder for cattle stock caused by drought, programmes at a cost of Rs 78 crore would be implemented to provide fodder. Further, works worth Rs 160 crore would be implemented to augment drinking water supply in urban areas. Similar measures would be implemented in rural areas at a cost of Rs 350 crore. To augment water availability to forest areas to cater to the needs of wild animals, Rs 5 crore would be allocated.

According to traders in Koyambedu, the vegetable and fruits market in Chennai, sugarcane sales have been the lowest in several years. This is despite the fact that they are trading at half the price. The demand has been low ever since the note ban in November, but we expected things to pick up by now. It has not, people are not buying as much they used to, said R Baranidharan, a farmer in the city to deliver his stock. A bundle with 20 canes is selling at just around `300. Last year, the rate was `500. But arriving stock are also at record lows across the state -- with only around 450 trucks making it to the market in the city.With the monsoon deserting the agricultural heartlands once again, yields have fallen drastically. With both demand and yield falling, Pongal income for farmers has been bad. Procurement rates are just around `150 per bundle with ten canes. Last year, it was more than `200, said B Raja, an agricultural landlord in Theni district of the state. Yields are also at record lows, he added. Other sectors are also taking a beating. Especially those that revolve around festival buying. For small garment traders, this Pongal has been one with little to cheer for. According to a top retailer in Chennai, average ticket size of sales have fallen nearly half.Meanwhile, Andhra Pradeshs Sankranti is bringing as little cheer. While drought isnt that big a problem, the cash crunch brought about by demonetisation is. Sankranti is celebrated mainly celebrating for the agriculture harvest. But due to demonetisation, farmers didnt get good prices for their produce. Some farmers have not even been able to sell any of their goods, even for a lower price. Farmers incomes have plummeted affecting other sector sales too, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskara Rao Andhra Pradesh federation of commerce and industry.Traders say that business has been affected by as much as 40 per cent depending on the business.It is a tradition to wear new clothes and many families present new clothes to sons-in-law during Sankranti. Textiles shops are seeing good business, but when compared to Sankranti sales every year, this years sales are low, said Srinivasa Rao, owner of Challapalli and Sons in Vijayawada."

This breaks the cycle of a three-month declining trend.WPI-based inflation had stood at 3.15 per cent in November.Triggering the inflation, the reading for manufactured articles was 3.67 per cent in December, compared to 3.2 per cent the previous month. Further, inflation in fuel and power segment saw a rise with the rate of inflation standing at 8.65 per cent in December, against 7.07 per cent in November. The inflation rate for petrol was at 8.52 per cent, while that for high speed diesel stood at 20.25 per cent.Production across every sector has gone down and there is more demand than supply, which led to this situation, says Jagat Shah, founder and mentor of Ahmedabad-based economic development organisation Cluster Pulse. After demonetisation, many SMEs cut production. For instance, in the Morbi Ceramic Cluster (Gujarat), 70 per cent of the factories stopped functioning. These factories produce `30,000 crore worth of goods annually.According to Aditi Nayar, principal economist, ICRA, the pick-up in WPI-based inflation reflected a combination of rising commodity prices and an unfavourable base effect.Even as vegetable prices have gone down, the price of sugar went up by 28.04 percent. The rate of inflation of pulses, too, continues to be high at 18.12 per cent in December, according to Ministry of Commerce. There was a surge in the price of egg, meat and fish and the rate of price high was 2.73 per cent during the month.The rise in price of pulses and grains, according to M G Chandrakanth, director, Institute of Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru, is because of lack of procurement centres."

Justice S Vaidyanathan gave the ruling while dismissing a petition from Thilagavathi, wife of the deceased person, claiming the entire money to be paid to her and her two children, who had attained majority. While working as a machine operator at Sakthi Sugar Mills at Sivaganga, Subramaniyan suffered a grave injury and subsequently, died.Based on the claim made by Thilagavathi under Sec. 22 of the Workmen Compensation Act, an award of Rs 5.75 lakh had been passed by the Tribunal and it had also become final in December 2015. Based on the report of the enquiry officer appointed by the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, Madurai, to ascertain the real dependents of the deceased employee, the children of the deceased had been excluded from the array of dependents as they had attained majority and the father and mother of the deceased were included and the award money was divided proportionately among the three -- the parents and the wife.Aggrieved, Thilagavathi approached the HC, contending that dependants as per the Act meant widow, a minor (legitimate or adopted) son, an unmarried (legitimate or adopted) daughter or a widowed mother, who alone are eligible to receive the compensation. As the mother of the deceased employee is not a widow, the question of granting compensation to them did not arise at all, she argued. The parents submitted that they were dependant on their deceased son and that due to ill-feeling, Thilagavathi had deserted her husband and did not live with him during his last period of two years.It was he, who had spent money for the deceased son's medical expenses and therefore, the impugned order is perfectly valid in the eye of law and it does not require any interference. Justice S Vaidyanathan, before whom the petition came up last month, found that there was nothing wrong in adding the parents of the deceased as dependants, as they rightly came under the purview of Sec. 2(1)(d)(iii)(b) of the Act, as it included a parent other than a widowed mother.Even assuming for the sake of argument that the children of the petitioner have got to be treated as dependants, the amount of compensation will have to be apportioned from the money payable to the petitioner herein and not from the amount payable to the parents of the deceased employee. Therefore, the Judge, finding no merits dismissed the petition."

The fate of the flora and fauna in the region has become a cause for concern with the Met department calling the impending summer a cruel one  Albin MathewKOCHI: Stay coolBesides the unbearable heat, summer season is also well known for the health problems that it brings in its wake. Express gives a few dietary tips that will help Kochiites beat the heatDrink lots of waterThis one is obvious, but it cant be repeated enough. In summer your body is prone to dryness as water is literally evaporating off you. So even more than usual, keep your body hydrated by drinking plenty of water.If plain water seems too boring, add a couple of slices of cucumber, a few berries, a squirt of lemon, or a few sprigs of lemon balm to keep you coming back for more.Coconut water: Coconut is full of health benefits and has wonderful cooling properties. It is laden with simple sugars, electrolytes and essential minerals which help keep the body well hydrated.Lime water: The simple lime water or nimboo pani is not only refreshing, it also has health benefits for you.Butter milk: A glass everyday to avoid dehydration and indigestion.Curd and Yoghurt: They are a great and healthy alternative to ice-cream as they are packed with nutrients, vitamins and calcium which help to soothe ulcers, allergies and heat boils during the season. Juices: Fresh fruit juices, including lemonade, help replenish the body of its lost fluids.VegetablesRaw vegetables are always cooling, but due to their high water content, the 5 veggies like cucumbers, radishes, lettuce, celery, spinach are especially good. Vegetables like onions, tomatoes and cucumbers should be regularly eaten as they will not only cool down the body but provide the daily quota of nutrition as well.Onions: Onions have amazing cooling properties. Red onions, in particular, are very rich in quercetin, which is a natural anti-allergen. Having lots of onions can provide you protection against sunstroke.Cucumber: This crunchy vegetable costs little, has lots of fibre that can help keep constipation at bay.Mint Mint is a simple, easily available, inexpensive herb which you can add to your curd to make pudina raita or have it in the form of chutneys besides using it in dips. The best thing about it is that you can grow it in a small pot at home for your use.Cardamom: A cup of cardamom tea can do wonders for those who have been in the hot sun for long because of its detoxifying properties.FruitsJust like raw vegetables, fruits are almost always cooling to the system. You can eat them directly as a snack or dessert, make a smoothie, or add them to your water for a tasty refreshing experience. Gooseberry (Amla): A great refresher and reverses the ageing effects caused by strong sun rays while providing extra stamina for gym sessions. It specially benefits heart and hair.Watermelon: If youre thirsty, watermelon works wonders in replenishing lost fluids for the body, Watermelon will keep you cool, hydrated, satiated and healthy. Melons contain lycopene that protects your skin against sun damage.Berries: Not only are these little gems delicious and sweet, but they are also packed with flavonoids that provide antioxidant benefits. They can also promote increased blood flow to your skin and decrease your sensitivity to light to improve your skins appearance, structure and texture,Pineapple: Pineapples provide a good mix of vitamins, antioxidants and enzymes like bromelain that can protect your body against inflammation.Mango: Mangos are packed with vitamin A and C.Papaya: Some people use papaya juice to tenderize meat or as a natural exfoliating ingredient for healthy and glowing skin. But there are also nutritional benefits to eating papaya on its own.Fish, especially ShellfishAgain tapping into the oceans coolness, Chinese medicine recognizes most fish as cool, and shellfish as cold in nature. This means that even after theyre cooked, the result of eating fish, especially shellfish, will be to counteract any heat thats lingering in your system.Foods not to eatYou must avoid burgers with meat patties, fries and other oily fare. Burgers and summer may sound like a match made in heaven, but the fact is they can give your body temperature a spike. Foods that contain high amounts of protein and fat heat up your body. They move slowly through the digestive system, causing your body to use more energy. However, the spike in temperature isnt enough to cause you to sweat and cool down, which happens when you eat spicy foods on hot days.(Inputs from Susan Itty,Clinical Nutritionist, Aster MediCity)"

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) estimated that the country already had around 65.1 million diabetes patients.As per a survey by National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bangalore, the prevalence of diabetes was 12.33 per cent and of pre-diabetes was 11.57 per cent of the total population.Increasing age, being overweight and obese, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy and untimely dietary habits have well proven association with prevalence of diabetes Pre-diabetes is a condition that predates diabetes mellitus. In pre-diabetes stage the levels of blood glucose are higher than normal but, remain below diabetic range.The condition is very common among Asians, especially Indians and data from different sources across the countries showed that nearly 20 per cent of urban Indians are prone to it. Certain lifestyle changes taken in pre-diabetes stage can prevent diabetes.SymptomsDiabetic patients with uncontrolled sugars usually suffer from increased frequency of urination, weight loss and extreme fatigue, but in pre-diabetes stage, the patient normally does not have any symptoms. A regular monitoring referred to as screening test would be the only way to diagnose the condition.Causes and Risk factorsInsulin is an essential element to transport glucose that the body produces to convert into energy. In pre-diabetes, the body is not able to produce enough insulin or is not able to function efficiently, also called insulin resistance leading to a higher-than-normal blood sugar level and possibly pre-diabetes.Prevention and treatmentPre-diabetes is the warning sign before it progresses to become type 2 diabetes. It is complex, multi-factorial, hugely influenced by genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors and excessive calorie intake.Eating well, eating healthy and regular exercise helps prevent progression of pre-diabetic patients to Type 2 diabetes. It is observed that consumption of vegetables had a significant connection with diabetes.People who consumed more than two servings of vegetable had lesser prevalence of diabetes. Many studies have shown that use of consuming high water soluble fibers present in vegetable and fruits and polyunsaturated fat in fish, help in preventing diabetes.Similarly, people at risk of and also those identified with pre-diabetes would benefit from lifestyle a change that includes weight loss and exercise for at least 30 minutes every day. This can improve insulin resistance and can lower elevated blood sugar levels diabetes.The author is a Consultant Diabetologist & Endocrinologist, Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road"

City Express gives you a low-down on what should be in your shopping bag.This season is popularly all about ankle lengths and cold-shoulders, and there is definitely a way to incorporate this in your traditional outfits too. If youre looking for something out of the box and contemporary, wear a dhoti sari, or a cold-shoulder anarkali. Capes have been ruling the red carpets and are a good add-on to your sari too, elaborates Arti Muthia, a stylist in the city.Fashion designer Ritika Singh shifts our focus to hues like fuschia, orange, pista green and yellow. Silk brocades with self patterns are fabrics which will go well. If youre not in the mood for an elaborate pattu sari, go for a brocade silk with paisleys, she says, elaborating that shades like blues, greens and greys are best avoided.No South Indian festival is complete without a half-sari or a pavadai, and you can add a modern twist to your attire with new patterns, fabrics and designs.The main point is to retain the conventional silhouette, and you can mix a half sari with crop top, make it drape with shawls. Velvet fabrics are also in and go well with traditional fabrics like silk, Ritika says. For women in the city who are always on the go with little time to devote to their outfits, chic straight-lined kurtas with block prints or digital prints are also an option. These can be paired with palazzos, culottes, scarves and kholapuris.For festivals like Pongal, it is imperative that your accessories dont overshadow your outfits. So its best to keep it unconventional with one piece of statement jewellery or temple jewellery. Its best if you keep those stone chandbalis, waist belts and maangtikkas for another occasion. This should be your mantra with makeup too: keep it simple, with a winged liner, and blush lips. And hey, dont forget the malli-poo around your bun!For all the men who cant tell the difference between white and ivory, its best to stick to a single tone pattu veshti with a gold zari border. There is something about this which screams timeless elegance. New designers are cropping up variations in their veshtis with black borders and embroidered motifs, so that can always be an option as well, Arti opines. The veshti can be paired with a shirt or kurta, with basic prints and colours. Have yourself a happy and fashionably fabulous Pongal!"

Geet Gawai, a traditional music and dance of Bhojpuri-speaking communities in Mauritius found its way to UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.The positive news for the descendants of the indentured labourers (now known has Girmitya), who were shipped from India by Britishers to work in Sugarcane farms in Mauritius has taken nearly two centuries to come by. It was 180 years after the first immigrants from the Bhojpuri belt of India set foot on Apravasi Ghat in Mauritius that the heritage has found international recognition.The first batch of 36 indentured Indian labourers who arrived at Port Louis in 1834 were from Bihar, the Bhojpuri speaking belt. The number of Girmitiyas grew and today a whopping 54 per cent of the Indian Diaspora in Mauritius speaks Bhojpuri, Chairperson of Mauritius Bhojpuri Speaking Union Sarita Boodhoo told the New Indian Express.Geet-Gawai is part of pre-wedding ceremony and combines rituals, prayer, songs, music and dance through which their honour Hindu Gods and Goddesses. It is seen as an expression of the collective identity of the Girmityas on the island, who have been struggling to preserve their languages; and is passed on within families, by community centres and academies.As Geet Gawai was on the brink of extinction, the elders of the community, said Boodhoo, tried to institutionalize the oral traditions. Soon the Bhojpuri Institute became an andolan and we started giving the singers, referred to as Geetharines, more importance. The Geetharines started performing in public and we invited the country's elite, especially those from other ethnic groups, to come and attend Geet Gawai sessions, Boodhoo said elaborating the process, how the tradition was preserved.The Girmityas have a mixed heritage with Bhojpuri, Tamil, Urdu, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati and Hindi being the languages of their forefathers. Mauritius has sought help from India in reviving these languages. Mauritian Art and Cultural Minister Prithivrajsing Roopun said that chairs were being set up in Universities and steps are being taken to impart the knowledge of language to the Girmityas.Mauritius has UNESCO two tangible heritage sites  Apravasi Ghat and le Morne Cultural landscape. While Apravasi Ghat has been the transit point for the Indian slaves indentured by the colonialists, le Morne Cultural Landscape represents slaves fight for freedom, their suffering and sacrifice as it was here in the inaccessible cliffs and isolated mountains the runaway slaves used to get shelter."

Justice S Vaidyanathan gave the ruling while dismissing a petition from Thilagavathi, wife of the deceased person, claiming the entire money to be paid to her and her two children, who had attained majority. While working as a machine operator at Sakthi Sugar Mills at Sivaganga, Subramaniyan suffered a grave injury and subsequently, died.Based on the claim made by Thilagavathi under Sec. 22 of the Workmen Compensation Act, an award of Rs 5.75 lakh had been passed by the Tribunal and it had also become final in December 2015. Based on the report of the enquiry officer appointed by the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, Madurai, to ascertain the real dependents of the deceased employee, the children of the deceased had been excluded from the array of dependents as they had attained majority and the father and mother of the deceased were included and the award money was divided proportionately among the three -- the parents and the wife.Aggrieved, Thilagavathi approached the HC, contending that dependants as per the Act meant widow, a minor (legitimate or adopted) son, an unmarried (legitimate or adopted) daughter or a widowed mother, who alone are eligible to receive the compensation. As the mother of the deceased employee is not a widow, the question of granting compensation to them did not arise at all, she argued. The parents submitted that they were dependant on their deceased son and that due to ill-feeling, Thilagavathi had deserted her husband and did not live with him during his last period of two years.It was he, who had spent money for the deceased son's medical expenses and therefore, the impugned order is perfectly valid in the eye of law and it does not require any interference. Justice S Vaidyanathan, before whom the petition came up last month, found that there was nothing wrong in adding the parents of the deceased as dependants, as they rightly came under the purview of Sec. 2(1)(d)(iii)(b) of the Act, as it included a parent other than a widowed mother.Even assuming for the sake of argument that the children of the petitioner have got to be treated as dependants, the amount of compensation will have to be apportioned from the money payable to the petitioner herein and not from the amount payable to the parents of the deceased employee. Therefore, the Judge, finding no merits dismissed the petition."

The Spanish company that goes by the name of Gik Blue tells City Express that they have received more than 500 emails from India and interested importers and distributors have approached them for bringing blue wine to the country.We would like to start with the biggest cities in the country: New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. All of them during the current year 2017, says Aritz Lpez, co-founder of Gik.Makers of the blue are six Spaniards all under the age of 30, who started the blue wine to shake things up in a country where wine is an established tradition. Currently operating in 20 countries, it took two years to develop the product and it was done in collaboration with University of the Basque Country. We wanted to shake things up a little bit and have fun. Wine felt like the best industry to shake things up, says Taig Mac Cathy, creator of Gik Blue Wine.Trouble StartsHowever, the electric-blue colour of the wine, has landed them in controversy. Spain has called for the product to be relabeled, on the grounds that wine cannot be blue, only red or white. Spain identifies 17 types of wine and blue is not on the list.The makers say the blue drink is more of a beverage than a wine, but it is a wine.How is it made blue? Its pretty straight forward, says Mac Cathy. First of all, a mixture is created from five different varieties of red and white grapes. Two organic pigments, anthocyanin, from the red grape skin, and indigotine, an organic salt commonly used as a reddish-blue food colourant is used to turn the drink into blue. The drink is 99 per cent wine and 1 per cent grape. A process to combine natural and chemical pigments were developed.It has the aroma of a ripe fruit and is slightly acidic with a sweet bubbly burst. The drink carries no added sugars to ensure it is a non-caloric and not alcoholic (since sugar ferments into alcohol)."

There are common myths associated with food allergies which needs to be addressed.Myth 1: Food allergy is very commonFact: Although 25 percent of people think theyre allergic to certain foods, studies show that about only eight percent of children and two percent of adults have food allergy.Myth 2: Most people with food allergies are allergic to oranges and tomatoesFact: Although people can be allergic to any kind of food, most food allergies are caused by nuts, cows milk, eggs, soy, fish, and shellfish.Myth 3: Some people are allergic to sugar and fatsFact: A condition is called a food allergy when the immune system fights against a certain protein in a food. This doesnt happen with sugar and fats.Myth 4: Milk allergy is very common in adultsFact: Milk allergy is much more common in children than in adults. Most children outgrow the allergy by the time they are six years old. Symptoms of milk allergy include hives, vomiting, and breathing problems after eating or drinking a dairy product. Some adults have trouble digesting the sugar in milk. This is called lactose intolerance. It isnt a true allergy. Symptoms of lactose intolerance are bloating, cramping, nausea, gas, and diarrhea.Myth 5: People with food allergies are allergic to many foodsFact: Most people with food allergies are allergic to fewer than four foods. Its important to test for food allergy and confirm this as its important not to stop all foods just based on some symptoms as growing children need all food.Myth 6: Allergy to food dye is commonFact: Natural foods cause the most allergic reactions. Studies have found that some food additives, such as yellow dye No.5 and aspartame (brand name: NutraSweet), cause problems in some people.Myth 7: Food allergy is either lifelong or is always outgrownFact: Children usually outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, soybean products, and wheat. But people usually do not outgrow allergies to nuts, fish, and shellfish.Myth 8: Food allergy is not dangerousFact: Food allergy can be fatal if it is severe enough to cause a reaction called anaphylaxis .This reaction makes it hard for a person to breathe. Fast treatment with a medicine called epinephrine can save your life.

Of this, over 100 MU was from BESCOM alone.As temperature rises, use of fans and air-conditioners throughout the day has increased, thus leading to a rise in the load on the power grid. In rural areas, power demand and consumption for farming purposes too has gone up due to poor rainfall.Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd Managing Director Kumar Naik said that on normal days, power consumption across the state is around 198MU. But for the past two weeks, it has crossed 210MU. On Friday (March 3), power consumption across state was 221.72 MU, which is a record so far, he said.Naik, however, said there will be no power shortage this year till monsoon.We have enough power. We have purchased from private companies and sugar factory owners, he said. According to him, power consumption on weekends is low as most offices remain closed.No load-sheddingWith SSLC and PUC exams just days away, many citizens expressed concern over the daily power disruptions. While residents have been complaining of unscheduled power cuts over the past few weeks, BESCOM officials maintain that there is no load-shedding.The officials said that for the last 10 days, power consumption crossed 100 MU and on Friday, it touched 103 MU. In some areas, due to technical reasons including tripping, there have been instances of power cuts. But this is not load-shedding, said a senior official from BESCOM.The official added that the transmission lines in Bengaluru are designed to load a certain capacity. But with demand rising, the load exceeds and leads to technical snags, causing power interruption. There is a proposal to increase the capacity of transmission lines, but nothing is on paper."

Only problem was he named Kerala CM as O Paneerselvam.Far from doing a Jallikattu on Vijayan, Paswan was actually wanting to help the Kerala CM -- an old acquaintance from UF days. Presumably, the mixup -- an inadvertent mistake -- was the result of theTamil Nadu CM being in news thanks to the fierce bull run and the youth uprising thereof.Well, the meeting was of a serious import, and the Kerala CM took the gaffe like a good sport, with a brush of hand, without any invocation of pride. His focus was more on the allocation of rice andsubsidised sugar for distribution among migrant workers and welfare institutions.In his meeting, Vijayan also asked the Centre to extend the rice procurement period for three months. Having rolled out the National Food Security Act in November 2016, under which foodgrains have tobe made available to the poor at a subsidised rate of Rs 1-3 per kg via public distribution system, Kerala is in need of a higher allocation from the Centre.Kerala CM has placed many demands before us. One is increasing foodgrains allocation under NFSA, Paswan told reporters after the meeting. Sources said, the Kerala Chief Minister's basic demand was that his state foodgrains supply for PDS supply should, at least, be restored to the level of pre-NFSA days.While under the NFSA, the state is getting 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains annually, it used to get 16.25 lakh tonnes earlier.There was a bit of hand wringing on the part of the Union Food Minister, who pointed that the Centre has adopted a uniform for all states while allocating foodgrains.Allocation under the NFSA is being made taking into account last three years average foodgrains lifting of the state. And the average was 10 lakh tonnes per annum for Kerala. But more is beinggiven to protect poor people, a Food Ministry official said.Kerala is asking for more allocation under the NFSA as it wants to cover the entire population. And that's beyond the policy of the Centre.Among other demands, the Kerala government has asked more subsidy support as the state wants to sell subsidised sugar to the entire population under the PDS. At present, sugar is supplied to only families of below poverty line (BPL).It has also asked for parboiled rice and additional foodgrains allocation of about 50,000 tonnes per month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the state.The state has also demanded to up the foodgrains allocation to 550 tonnes per month for welfare institutions from the existing monthly allocation of 212 tonnes , while it has sought central support tomake extra payment to state-run FCI labourers.That apart, the Kerala government has asked the Centre to extend rice procurement period for three months."

They were asked not rely solely on agriculture ministry's cane output data.""The states have been told to collect mill-wise sugar yields instead of taking the states' average while estimating the sugar output so as to check if mills are under-reporting, the official said.""There are possibilities that mills may be underreporting production figures... The mill-wise sugar yields will help get the accurate picture,"" the official added.Sugar production of India, the world's second-largest producer and biggest consumer, is estimated to be lower in 2016-17 due to a possible sharp drop in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to drought. The output stood at 25.1 million tonnes during 2015-16 marketing year."

The smell of wet earth hits you like a gentle breeze and is a welcome distraction from the strong malodour of diesel. Nope, this isnt a greenhouse but a bus terminus in Mogappair.A huge MTC bus is getting parked on the other side of the garden fence. A conductor steps off the bus and waves at Balaji and greets him fondly, Vaanga thotakarare (Welcome Mr Gardener)! Balaji, an MTC bus driver, brought his interest in gardening to work and the result: three gardens, inside JJ Nagar Bus Terminus.My parents were farmers and I loved farming. But I moved to the city after finishing my education. In 2005, I joined as a driver for 7H. I saw this empty space in the corner and planted a coconut tree, says Balaji.A garden that bloomed with a single tree, now has guava, papaya, pomegranate and banana. Between the trees shrubs and creepers of different kinds of jasmine, chrysanthemum and even bittergourd have fully bloomed. The garden is also filled with different herbs that have medicinal value.Balaji points to a weak sapling and says, This is keezhanelli. They use it to treat Jaundice. This one here is karpooravalli. It helps with cold and chest congestion. That plant with the thick leaf is a type of bryophyllum. They give that leaf to people who have diabetes. Did you know that if you bend the leaf of a bryophyllum into the soil and bury it, it will grow into another plant?Balaji proudly points at each plant and shares how they could be beneficial. When a worker has a function at home, the plantains will somehow always bear bananas. They take an entire bunch back home. Next time they come back from their village, they bring me fertilizers or new plants, he smiles.Even managers and senior officers at the terminus encourage and support Balajis garden. Apart from watering the garden, we pool in money for almost everything, he says. He points to the newly painted gate to the garden and says, They painted the bus and had a little bit left. They said I could paint my garden gate with it. The driver is a local hero and is also a gardening consultant now for the local residents of the area."

According to sources, a science exhibition was organised at the Government Higher Secondary School in Tunavasipatti on October 18, 2016.Among those who visited the event were E Gokul, a Class IX student, and a Class X student, who hails from Mathipatti village. As the two were going around, the senior student offered Gokul a drink saying it was sugar solution.Within minutes of drinking it, Gokul collapsed. Panic-stricken school teachers rushed him to a nearby hospital, which referred him to a private hospital in Tiruchy. It emerged that Gokul was made to drink a solution of baking soda (Sodium Bicarbonate), and it caused extensive damage to his food pipe. According to doctors, the food pipe contracted due to infection.After two weeks of treatment, Gokul was discharged and the hospital informed his parents that he would need intensive treatment after the initial wounds healed. The hitch was the cost of the treatment is prohibitive and Gokuls parents are daily wage labourers.Gokul retuned to school but because of the damage suffered, he kept fainting and throwing up following which the school management sent him home with the assurance that he can avail of as much leave as necessary.Worried about their sons deteriorating condition, Gokuls parents admitted him to the SRM hospital, where is currently undergoing treatment.Recalling the incident, Gokuls mother said, My son is unable to recover from the illness after consuming the baking soda solution. The school should have monitored children carefully that day, which could have prevented such an accident.Sakthivel, headmaster of the school, acknowledged that such an incident took place and pointed out that officials took Gokul to the hospital and provided him with first aid. Further, he added that teachers had contributed from their pockets to pay for Gokuls initial stay in the hospital.When contacted, Chief Education Officer of Karur M Ramasamy, said he will enquire about Gokuls current condition adding that he was informed that the former had rejoined school after the incident."

These include passing on the benefits of a fall in petrol/diesel prices to ensure reduction in freight charges, investment funds in warehousing sector to prevent wastage of food, and bank accounts for every farmer for direct transfer of subsidies.The sector also wants the issue of tax structure mismatch addressed. There is a 12.5 percent excise duty levied on the cotton sector for man-made fibres, while cotton fibres attract none.The United Planters Association of Southern India (UPASI) wants the Plantation Labour Act 1951 to provide weighted deduction up to 200 per cent of the actual expenditure for providing welfare facilities to their workers.The ambiguity with regard to the allowance of deduction of replanting expenses for tea, coffee and rubber, an interim order may be issued to the tax officers concerned to allow replanting expenses as a deduction from total income in tea, coffee and rubber till the rules are appropriately amended, says D Vinod Sivappa, president, UPASI.According to him, Rule 7B of the IT Act should be amended to tax coffee only from the stage of roasting and powdering, where value addition takes place. This would enable the grower to sell coffee directly and thereby increase his share in the value chain.We have recommended to the government not to reduce the import duty in order to protect domestic growers, Rubber Board Chairman Ajith Kumar said.According to Kamal K Chowdhury, President, All India Rubber Industries Association, India levies one of the highest duties on import of raw materials and one of the lowest duties on import of finished rubber goods.This inverted duty structure is leading to a surge in import of finished goods. Of the total import of finished goods, 80-90 per cent is avoidable as domestic rubber manufacturing units have the capability to meet the demand, but low import duties on rubber products especially under FTAs (free trade agreements) have led to indiscriminate imports in the country."

The Power Company of Karnataka Limited (PCKL) has already called for a short tender to purchase power between 800MW and 1,200MW (depending on the demand).Agreement between bidders and the KPCL was prepared over 15 days ago, said Kumar Naik, managing director, Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL).Hydel power generated in September was not utilised. We have sufficient water and are capable of generating power, he added. The state government will also be buying power from sugar factories.M K Shankarlinge Gowda, chairman, Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC), said the state government and sugar factories had filed a petition before them regarding fixing of the tariff. In the interim tariff passed by the commission, KERC fixed it at `3.47 per unit.Electricity supply companies will pay the amount to sugar factories and buy not more than 500MW from them. There are 28 sugar factories which together generate over 500MW, but there were no takers for it in Karnataka. With the state government getting additional 500MW, power crisis is likely to reduce, he said.Official sources from Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) say they are capable of managing 210 mega units per day. The government is purchasing more power. However, the demand is likely to shoot up to a great extent in agricultural as well as the domestic sector. Water scarcity will only add to the problem. In that case, governments efforts may not be enough and the problem of a power outage will persist, said a source.A senior official from BESCOM said they were planning to install rooftop solar panels on state- and central government-owned buildings. We have identified around 80 state-owned buildings on which solar panels will be fixed. This is expected to lessen the burden on our grid in summer. In the next phase, 200 buildings owned by Central government will be covered, the official said.Though the state generates around 280 Million Units (MU) of power a day through hydro, thermal power stations, a part of it goes waste during transmission. The states power consumption per day stands at 190 Million Units (MU). During summers, the demand soars to 200 MU.We can manage up to 210 MU a day this summer, said a senior official from Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited.In the last seven years, the state has spent Rs 24,694 crores to purchase 50,148 MU. Naik said more than 50 percent of power is generated from KPCL and the rest from NHPC Limited (within Karnataka and other states)."

The vagaries of nature are on full display and the victims are farmers who are devastated as whatever crop they managed to nurture in an otherwise lacklustre samba season is about to go waste.With heavy downpour lashing the northern taluks of tail-end Cauvery delta for the past two days, as much as 80 per cent of paddy fields awaiting harvest are reportedly inundated. With agriculture department yet to assess the damage, farmers in the northern region of Nagapattinam district are claiming that close to 40,000 hectares of paddy are submerged.Around 40,000 hectares of paddy in Mayiladuthurai, Kollidam, and Sirkazhi have been affected by the rain, which has stalled harvest. There is also a risk of as much as 50 percent loss due to high moisture content affecting yield, said R Pandurangan, district president of Tamil Uzhavar Periyakkam. These farmers risk an even bigger loss, as the crop that withstood the drought managed to do so with borewell water after the monsoon failed and Cauvery water did not reach them.Farmers in Nallur, Edamanal, Semmangudi near Sirkazhi and Mayiladuthurai towns added that if the rains continued, the ADT-38 and ADT-46 medium period paddy crops in the northern parts of Nagapattinam will be completely destroyed. After the inspection for droughts by State and Central teams, it perhaps is time for another team, this time to assess rain damage, Pandurangan added.It is not rosy even for those who managed to complete harvest before the rains.At the regulated market in Vriddhachalam in Cuddalore, about 15,000 sacks of paddy were soaked in the rain, leading to fears among farmers that the traders will offer only lesser price.Harvest had begun after Pongal festival, and until January 25, about 20, 000 sacks of paddy were to the market. But only half of them have been procured due to procedural problems, while the rest has been kept on the premises. Though there are tarpaulins to cover the sacks, the water has soaked our paddy, lamented a local farmer.P Vinayagamurthy, who heads Lower-Anicut Farmers Association, said the sudden rains have kept the farmers on tenterhooks. Many farmers had borewell facilities to overcome the drought. But now, the harvesting vehicles cant get into paddy fields due to stagnating water.Some farmers, who had already begun harvesting a few days ago, dumped the harvested paddy in fields itself. Before they take their produce to the market, rains have soaked them. It would be of no use once it sprouts.The situation is similar in Villupuram, where sugarcanes were soaked in the rain. Farmers are worried that the cane will get spoiled if it is not taken for grinding in a few days."

Padmaja Vasudev launched her book Kauchi  The Legacy of Kausalya recently which holds a true story with no exaggeration or fictional elements. The story is about her sister with muscular dystrophy and a mothers undying spirit.Twelve years in the making, Padmaja talks to us about her family, the trigger that got her to pen down their story and the awareness she is trying to create for her readers. It all started when 8-year-old Kausalya began to fall even while walking on a smooth surface. Being diagnosed with muscular dystrophy that had no cure, no preventive measures and research at that time in 1967, it was a big blow.Ashwin PrasathThough my little sister did not understand the gravity of the situation at that age, my mom was shocked. She cried initially like any mother would but after that one break down, it was only her determination to be there for her daughter  all day, all night.While Kausalya was adjusting with her weakened muscles and discomfort, she didnt let it get to her. She would always have solutions for people with other problems and there was no room for anyone to feel pity. The sisters share a strong bond. They talk for hours, read things to each other, sing together too. Padmaja reckons her positive attitude was induced in her because of her mothers positivity about the entire situation.As much as the patient is affected by any condition that he or she suffers from, the caregivers also go through stress, denial and frustration. Once, when my mother was hospitalised, I happened to chance upon an article on Caretaker Syndrome.After I read it, I was amazed to find out that my mom did not have it. It talked about how the caregiver gets depressed, needs rest and change of duty. My mom who has been taking care of Kausalya for years always had a smile and never complained. She told me that god has blessed her with Kausalya. I know mothers who can get frustrated and depressed after a point of time, but not my mother.She thought about her sisters carefree, positive attitude, her mothers unconditional devotion and her brother and his wifes constant support. This was her trigger to write the story. I was an ordinary person surrounded my extraordinary people. I had to write and inspire other caregivers and patients.Her mother and Kausalya did read the first part of her book but were not alive to see it completed and printed. She narrated another chilling incident. In 2008, at the age of 52, Kausalya was under the support of oxygen as her lungs weakened. She was worried and scared about death. Padmaja read her a piece from Socrates that talked about how death was a window to the soul to embark upon a new journey. She was satisfied.One night, she woke up with a sudden appetite. She ate curd rice, sambhar, some sugar and water and then said Ive had everything. I am going to sleep. She passed away 15 minutes later. When my mother heard, she went to the next room and lay down. She was quiet and when I asked her if she knew what had happened, she said she did. And then she went into coma. Twelve days later, she passed away. Padmaja knew the story would resound with many and inspire persons with disabilities and conditions and also caregivers. Eight years later, after sudden jolts of inspirations in the middle of nights, the book is finally out.Padmaja wants her readers to know, The books will let you see the truth and the importance of acceptance. At the basic level, its all about being positive. Accepting and embracing hurdles that are thrown in your path. It can bring about a lot of positive change.(For details about the book priced at `150, call publishing house Thanga Thamarai Pathippagam, 24414441)"

He has also been tapping into the legendary flavour palettes of Rajapalayam and Hampi, packing traditional pickle and powder recipes under the brand Panakam. He talks to CE about his journey, his original plan of becoming an ornithologist and his biggest takeaway from Gen Next.What are the misconceptions youve heard about wine at tasting sessions?There are people who come to these things, motivated strongly to improve their complexionto get fairer. There are many with heart trouble who start drinking red wine because it helps blood flow in the body. I met a couple of people fresh from a heart treatment, and hoping to get better with a few doses of wine. This is not funny, and we arent as well-informed as we should be.Which wine does India prefer to drink?People in India, at least a good 70% of them, prefer red wine. People know of its health benefits and that it has a less sugar content than the white. Also, the colour is quite appetizing.Which is your favourite wine?A French burgundy red wine; I dont like pairing it with anything. Its made of a grape called pinot noir. I enjoy its taste.Do you enjoy other varieties of alcohol?Before heading to France, drinking was never on the itinerary. I have tasted all the different kinds of hard liquor but I have somehow never been able to warm up to the taste of anything else. I stick to my wines and maybe a beer from time to time.What was your ambition as a child?I wanted to become an ornithologist. I loved bird watching back in school. That changed to historian and archaeologist subsequently. I wanted to become a singer as well, but that came true in some senses.What are your hobbies?Reading and travelling are my biggest hobbies besides work. I am into philosophy and Vedanta and I read literature across languages like French and English as well. I am a huge history buff and enjoy culture and art. I am coming out with a book on the history of pickles where my passions for history and reading are coming together. I love learning new languages and cooking as well. I also dabble in world music occasionally, and enjoy a little painting from time to time. Up until one point, I used to send friends handmade cards on important occasions. The problem with having too many interests is its easy to go astray and neglect one at the others expense.Your favourite destination?After India, France is next. Paris is like a second city to me. France and the whole of Europe top my list. Among all the other places I have been to, Cameroon is easily one of my favourites. In Cameroon, I remember, I went hungry for almost two days because I didnt get vegetarian food. I lived on juices, water and a few mangoes. Its not easy or safe to travel to places like this because of the dense forests there. The leaves appear black. There is a beauty in something pristine.Do you start your day with wine?A lot of people ask if I have wine every morning. I am wine taster but that doesnt mean I am an alcoholic (laughs). It so happens, I drink only once or twice a month. I drink on occasions not every day.Do you like cinema?Among all my interests, cinema is like the Z in my alphabets. I do enjoy watching all kinds of cinema. I dont have favourites. I like my dose of French films from time to time.How has marriage changed your perspective of business?I had a love marriage. I met my wife around 15 years ago when we were volunteers for SPIC MACAY, a cultural exchange body, when we were studying in Delhi. She is an economist, so theres an added advantage. Marriage helps because you get an extra hand at handlingyour matters. We have a 11-year-old son and he has similar interests and I see myself in him.Has your son participated in any of your tasting sessions?There are close to 4-5 thousand books at home on different subjects. My son has learnt to name all the wines but he hasnt tasted anything yet. That may have to wait till hes 18."

But, its never too late to reverse the ill effects of such behaviour. Smoking/Drug addiction is considered cool among certain circles, especially among teenage girls. But are they aware that smoking can damage their heart, lungs and even hair and skin? There are other alternatives available such as Nicotine Patches and Electronic Cigarettes which are less harmful. Binge Drinking is also on the rise among Indian women. Consumption of 3-4 beverages daily can be detrimental to their health, leading to liver damage, increase in blood pressure, memory loss, fatigue and depression. Reversal of this habit will make the person feel more energetic and lively. Having a glass of red/white wine in a week is considered safe. Most of the women tend to skip their breakfast in the morning, and then they much on junk food to keep away the hunger cravings. This only leads to over-eating. This predisposes women to medical ailments like PCOS, obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Focus on having regular meals based on a high protein diet and low carbohydrate diet. Drink plenty of fluids. Women tend to sleep for fewer hours, due to stress, or more working hours. Lack of sleep does have an impact on health in terms of decreased concentration, fatigue and heart problems. For a healthy lifestyle, ensure that you get 7 to 8 hours of sleep. Stress/Worrying too much is known to be a common feature in all the women. This ultimately leads to anxiety, fatigue and depression. Therefore, regular exercise, yoga and meditation is recommended which act as stress buster. Walking in a high heels on a daily basis is a trendy fashion among women. This can cause put pressure on the joints leading to back pain, tendon injuries and heel related accidents. Safe option is to wear heels of up to 1.5 inches can be put on with the extra soles of the feet. Spending long hours of watching TV, browsing net/or on phone can affect the health enormously. This will not only affect the eyes but increases the risk of heart attack and sugar levels in the blood. Restriction may be difficult but gradual reduction with this addiction is the only solution. Some women sleep with their make up on at night. Now, this can damage the skin and may cause irritation including the eyes. So, always make sure that the make up is removed before going to sleep. Though carrying a big heavy handbag seems to be a style icon for every woman, but this can cause aches and pains o of the shoulders, neck and back due to pressure effect. Safest means is to only carry the essentials that are needed. Some women have a habit of checking their weight daily and expect their weight to reduce on a daily basis. This wrong concept leads to unnecessary stress and affect their health. Weight should be checked once /twice a month. Painkillers/sedatives are taken routinely to relieve stress. These medications cause more harm than good. Many suffer with ulcers, high blood pressure, and heart problems after prolonged use. Try other alternatives such as exercises and stress relief busters instead. There has to be a constant drive to inculcate the good habits rather than bad ones, which can affect mind, body and health.The author is a senior consultant of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Aster CMI hospital"

The nephrologists are expressing their concern that kidney diseases have made a major change in the disease profile of society over the years and warned that chronic kidney disease may turn into renal failure if detected late.According to nephrologists, youth are increasingly becoming vulnerable to kidney problems given their liking for a sedentary lifestyle and addiction to smoking and liquor. In children, the symptoms of kidney disease are often non-specific, leading to late diagnosis. The leading causes of kidney failure in youth are hereditary often lacking obvious indicators such as hematuria (red blood cells in the urine), hypertension (high blood pressure) or edema (swelling). Early diagnosis of chronic kidney diseases in children can help a child grow and develop normally, they suggest.Urologist and Laparoscopic surgeon AV Krishna Kishore at KK Hospitals warns youth are often vulnerable to kidney diseases in future resulting from lifestyle related diseases during early childhood and adolescence. It is vital to disseminate information regarding the risk of kidney diseases, early detection and to facilitate a healthy lifestyle starting right from birth and continuing up to old age, he said.The burden of kidney diseases has been going up and there are three basic categorisations for kidney diseases-obesity, diabetes and age. In most of the cases, kidney disease is a secondary illness that results from a primary disease or condition such as diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure. Around 50 per cent of people who have diabetes develop kidney problems and hence, it is important for people with diabetes to have regular kidney function tests, he added.People especially youth are at the highest risk of affecting with kidney disease since they are fond of food items such as parathas and beef and are also prone to high stress levels and inadequate exercise. Early symptoms like lethargy, swelling of the feet or face, or frequent urination can be attributed to something else and they are very difficult to pinpoint, said G Sarath Babu, a nephrologist.The primary prevention method to prevent kidney diseases is to do annual screening test, regulate blood sugar and pressure level and lead a balanced lifestyle. He also pointed out that chronic kidney diseases could lead to other complications such as heart disease, stroke and infections. Those with diabetes, hypertension, anaemia, kidney stone, obesity or family history were more prone to kidney ailments, he said. Urine test is the best method of detecting kidney ailments. But most patients consulted a doctor after 90 per cent of their kidney functioning was lost, he added."

A fasting blood sugar or FBS value of 70 to 90 and post prandial blood sugar or PPBS value of 120 to 140 is considered to be normal. However, fluctuations appear in these levels which could be either age related or genetic.In my case, I had developed a thyroid deficiency due to changes in the hormonal levels in my body. What really intrigued me was that my FBS was always in the high side while PPBS was more or less normal. In fact, most of the time, the two values were equal!Glucose metabolism is regulated by the hormones secreted from the pancreas, including insulin and glucagon. Insulin reduces high glucose levels while glucagon produces the glucose that is stored in the liver as glycogen.In a pre diabetic person, a couple of changes happen in the body at night, when it is in a fasting state due to hormonal imbalance.These changes can result in fasting glucose levels that are higher than normal. This is because some pre-diabetic people develop a resistance to insulin, which controls the storage and release of glucose from the liver.While you are asleep and inactive, the liver releases more glucose than is needed, into the bloodstream. In those who have developed insulin resistance, glucagon is also breaking down liver glycogen at the same time, and producing more glucose when the body is resting.This results in higher flux of glucose in the blood stream than is normal. This condition is referred to as impaired fasting glucose tolerance.Therefore evening meals and snacks do not play such an important role as is believed, in increasing FBS values .It is well known that if your Fasting Blood Sugar is high, it may not be entirely due to your diet it can be a metabolic aberration.So you see, there is no use in cutting down on your food and sugar unnecessarily before a blood test. It is far better take your medication on time, exercise regularly and follow your doctors suggestions regarding your diet.Having done that, just eat a normal meal, relax and have a good nights sleep before going for your blood test the next morning. If you are tense and worried about your test results, that itself will increase glucose levels. In any case, now many doctors depend on a test called HbA1c which gives an overall picture of what average blood sugar levels have been over a period of weeks.Usually after around 10 years, pre-diabetics become diabetic. To prevent this from happening, it is necessary to control your FBS through proper medication, before the condition becomes worse.With correct medication and changes in lifestyle, a pre- diabetic person can prolong the period before she or he becomes diabetic, and the 10 years can be stretched to 15 or more."
