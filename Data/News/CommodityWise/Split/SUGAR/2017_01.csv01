Keeping diabetes under control is a collaborative effort. A diabetes specialist plays a very important role in maintaining your health life-long. Listed below are a few questions that you must ask your specialist. Prepare these questions before stepping inside the clinic.How frequently should I check my blood sugar?This is one of the questions very commonly asked by diabetic patients. Dont be afraid if you end up discovering that your friend has been advised more frequent checks than what you have been told to do. Patients with different needs are advised different frequencies of monitoring. You should ask this question at every session you are attending and find out whether you should increase or decrease your monitoring level.Can I resort to a generic medication schedule?This is the real concern among patients who find it difficult to afford the expensive diabetes medicines.There are times when patients assume that they have to continue with the expensive drugs prescribed by their specialists. In some cases, its true that you have no other option but to rely on them- but there also are few instances when you can afford to make the switch - as has been mentioned above. So, it is important to ask your specialists before assuming things too quickly.How do I take my medications and when do I take them?As obvious as it may sound- there are many patients who are not as meticulous in their approach as they should be. Your medication might be different from that of other diabetic patients who you know. Make sure you are not relying on half-baked information from the doctors - thinking that you will ask other diabetic friends about their dosages and take them in accordance. If you think that your specialist has not offered you complete information make sure you are proactively asking questions, taking down notes and acting in accordance.Taking these steps will definitely help you take the most of visiting your consultant. So keep them in mind without fail!(The doctor is MD, DM, Consultant, Endocrinologist, Apollo Sugar Clinics Limited, Hyderabad)"

At least 30 different innovations in the sector are stuck, pending approvals from the government.While the retail value of the Indian bio-economy is estimated at $35 billion, projects in the agri-biotech industry have failed to receive an impetus.According to data available with the Association of Biotech Led Industries (ABLE), the retail value of bio agri sector sums up to $9.015 billion, out of which $9 billion is accounted for by commercialisation of Bt cotton alone, with no representation of innovation in any other crops, as licences have not been granted for their field testing.The ABLE Agriculture (Able-Ag) has urged the government to relax policy norms, as companies are finding it hard to get approvals for field testing of their innovations.The Centre had mandated organisations to secure no-objection certificates (NOCs) from the respective state governments and in majority of the cases, approvals were being denied, mostly because of a threat perception about Bt crops, according to members of the association.The government needs to open it up for testing, at the very least. Unless these innovations can be tested for their safety, how can the safety concerns around Bt crops be addressed? asked Shivendra Bajaj, executive director, Able-Ag.The projects awaiting approvals include innovations developed by Indian Institute ofHorticulture Research, Sugarcane Breeding Research Institute, Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, apart from several private companies with regard to crops such as cotton, maize, mustard, corn, sugarcane, papaya and tomato among others.Giving a glimpse into the situation, he said things were getting worse for the technology year-on-year, for the past five-six years.The irony is that much of the data generated in India is being made of use of by other countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, which entered the field much later, are now making use of Bt innovations in agriculture. Every year, they are slowly increasing the cultivation of Bt brinjal. Pakistan has commercialised Bt maize after testing it for several years. In India, it is still pending even though we started testing it way earlier, Bajaj said.As for the safety concerns, Bajaj said India imported edible oils generated from Bt crops in other countries, while back home there was apprehension about allowing the development of these crops."

Though initiatives to encourage judicious use of water, achieving self-sufficiency in production of Foot and Mouth Disease vaccine and others has been introduced, critics believe that such schemes would do too little to provide any relief for agricuture and allied sectors. Ryot organisations, whose primary demand has been loan waiver of farmers, too aren't happy with the budget.AllocationsThe standalone allocation for agriculture and allied sectors - horticulture, sericulture, animal husbandry and fisheries - was 4.91 per cent of the total budget. Since, a large portion of the funds is set aside to continue the existing welfare schemes, the budget has little to offer in terms of new initiatives. 'New Schemes' listed in the agriculture sector of the budget includes expanding Krishi Bhagya scheme to parts of Malnad and coastal districts of the State, expanding the existing Krishi Yantradhare Programme to 250 more centres and incentives for adoption of technology in farming.The proposal to start a 'Cashew Development Board' raises questions on the novelty of the project, as a Karnataka Cashew Development Corporation Limited, a State government enterprise, was already in place.Some initiatives under animal husbandry, such as constructing modern abattoirs at each revenue division and subsidies to modernise meat stalls, aim at improving sanitation.'Totally Hopeless'Reacting to the budget, Badagalapura Nagendra, general secretary of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha termed it as 'totally hopeless'. ""Expectations of ensuring income guarantee to farmers has not been fulfilled, while the State is keen on revising the pay of government employees via the seventh pay commission. The budget is not visionary and has an unequal allocation of funds to urban areas,"" he said.Kurabur Shantakumar, president of Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association, said that despite the large number of farmer suicides, the State has ignored the plight of farmers. Hopes of loan waiver too has not been realised,"" he added.Water ResourcesThe cautious allocation of funds - reflected in less new projects, while existing old ones - is also observed in funds sanctioned to water resources and minor irrigation. Of the Rs 18,028 crore (Rs 15,929 cr for Water resources and Rs 2,099 cr for minor irrigation), only 3,789 crore is for new projects. The projects are similar to the ones taken up by the State - in the form of repairing canals and rejuvenating water bodies."

If the debt taken over from TANGEDCO by the government is excluded, the fiscal deficit in 2016-2017 would be Rs 38,526 crore, which will be 2.88 per cent of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), adding that the fiscal deficit breaching the norms during the current fiscal was only temporary due to TANGEDCOs debt takeover and deficit would be addressed in 2017-18.Referring to the Economic Survey, which projected the growth rate for 2017-18 between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent, the Finance Minister said, The pace of economic activity is picking up and it is expected that GSDP will grow at 7.94 per cent at constant prices during 2016-17. We expect that the concerted efforts of this government would further create a favourable environment for increased private and public investment in key sectors, thus boosting the economic growth to nine per cent during the year 2017-18.Despite an increase in revenue expenditure due to the additional commitment of the government towards interest payments under the UDAY scheme, free power up to 100 units for domestic consumers and cooperative loan waiver scheme, the revenue deficit in 2017-18 would be contained at the previous years level. The low economic growth, demonetisation and the ban on sale of property in unapproved layouts have dented the receipts from stamp duty and registration charges severely. Considering these factors, receipts from stamp duty and registration charges are expected to be Rs 8,220 crore during 2017-2018 as against Rs 7,985 crore estimated in revised estimates 2016-2017."

That the State was able to collect Rs 87,287 crore as tax against Rs 90,691 crore estimation reflected the failure of the government authorities, he said.Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) founder Vijayakant said while last years budget announcements were still on paper, the government should focus more on implementation.On the other hand, MDMK general secretary Vaiko welcomed various announcements including Kancheepuram medi park and food product clusters. However, he expressed disappointment over no announcement on release of arrears to sugarcane farmers.Communist Party of India (CPI) state secretary R Mutharasan said the government has ignored the welfare of unorganised sector and construction workers. There is no attempt to pressurise the Centre to release pending amounts and pass the NEET Bill, he added.Despite an unprecedented drought this year, the government has not responded appropriately by increasing food production target.Rather, it has reduced the target from 1.47 crore ton last year to 1 crore ton this year, said CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan."

Each group would be given a corpus fund of Rs 5 lakh besides channelising grants and credit available to Farmer Producer Organizations from NABARD and Small Farmer Agri Business Consortium. Government had allocated Rs 100 crore for this purpose. This scheme will be scaled up in the future to benefit 40 lakh farmers.He said fragmentation of land holdings was a major challenge to agriculture with 74.47 lakh of the total 81.18 lakh operational holdings being small and marginal. These small and marginal farms have limited capacity to mobilise credit, adopt latest technologies and add value to their agricultural produce, Jayakumar observed.The minister also announced a three-fold increase in the allocation for implementing Kudimaramath scheme, launched a few days ago by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami at Manimangalam lake in Kancheepuram district. For the current year, Rs 100 crore has been allocated. But for 2017-18, Rs 300 would be earmarked. Stating that the government had set a target of producing 100 lakh metric tonnes of food grains in 2017-2018, the minister said, Considering the fact that sugarcane is a highly water intensive crop and the area under cultivation is coming down, special efforts are being made to increase the area under the Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative (SSI) method of cultivation and drip irrigation to enhance productivity and to compensate production loss due to area reduction. Hence, drip irrigation will be extended to 35,000 acres under sugarcane and 40,000 acres under SSI method of cultivation."

Reason-- Unable to eat excess thick rice, many Below Poverty Line (BPL) families are selling it in the local market.Even while the rice is not being utilised, Chief Minister Siddaramiah is all set to announce additional 2-3 kg of rice per person in the budget that will be presented on Wednesday.Soon after Siddaramiah became the CM in 2013, he announced Anna Bhagya scheme, where the state government would give 5kg rice per person at `1 per kg for BPL families. But from 2016, it is given free of cost. There are 109 lakh beneficiaries who are eligible to get rice and other grains under this scheme from nearly 21,000 fair price shops.Sources from the department said they procure 2.17 metric tones of rice every month from the Government of India for `3 per kg.We give 5kg of rice per person for BPL families. But many are not using it as the rice is thick and not ideal for cooking. They use it to make dosas or idlis. Since they do not need the rice in large quantity, they either sell it to shops or strike a deal with fair shop owners.In a few cases, the fair shop owners who will have excess stock will sell the rice to other shops for extra price. Grains given by the state government, especially rice are being misused. Cases have also been registered against some individuals, fair price shop owners, rice mill owners and truck owners for transporting the rice illegally, sources said.Bhagyamma (name changed), resident of Gangondanahalli said they make ragi mudde, twice a day. As we are a family of six members, we get 30 kg of rice per month. We hardly eat rice, so we sell it to a nearby shop, she said.How many days can we eat dosas and idlis. We get rice for cheaper price, so we buy it, she added.As per the data available with Express, since 2013-14, 33,995.47 quintal of rice (close to 34 lakh kg of rice) and 9,202.57 qunital (close to 92,000kg of wheat) has been seized by the department officials. They also seized some quantity of ragi, sugar, oil and other products.However, when compared to rice, the supply of other products is less in terms of quantity. We supply rice per person. Whereas, other products like sugar, ragi and oil are given based on number of family members, said sources.When contacted, Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader said more number of cases are detected due to sincerity of officials.According to World Health Organisation, the intake of carbohydrates by an individual should be more so we are increasing the quantity of rice per person in our budget, he said.Over thick rice being supplied, Minister said they get rice from Punjab and Haryana which might be little thick. People who are illegally selling it will anyway find an excuse, but the thickness is not the sole reason to sell rice, he said."

He said though the Central government had stopped the grant given for special PDS in 2012, the scheme was being continued considering the interest of the people.During J Jayalalithaas rule, she extended the scheme every six months so that pulses and edible oil reach people uninterruptedly. The last extension had come to an end on December 31 and for reasons known to him, the then Chief Minister O Panneerselvam did not extend the scheme.A meeting was organised by Panneerselvam on January 2 for extending the special PDS. But he did not extend the scheme. Despite my repeated reminders in person, Panneerselvam kept quiet without giving any firm reply. So, his inaction was the sole reason for the delay in supply of pulses and edible oil through ration shops for a few days, Kamaraj said.A meeting convened by the Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on March 2 had extended the Special PDS and the order was issued immediately. The next day, steps were taken to procure 20,000 tonnes of pulses and 15,000 tonnes of palm oil. Within a few days, pulses and edible oil will be supplied to people through ration shops, the minister said."

Wanithasays that on the days she eats millets, she has no extra food cravings and that actually helps herkeep fit.Added to it all, millet is such a versatile food.

Parents of a seven-year-old, who has a condition that falls under the Autism Spectrum Disorder, have set off an online trend with their emoticon  called the Supporticon  and #baketosupport.Geetha VR, a former advertising professional, was getting tired and anxious about peoples reaction to her sons behaviour in public spaces like restaurants. My son Om has a condition that falls under the Autism Spectrum Disorder. In fine dining restaurants, when they play soothing music, it is a sensory imbalance for him. He may scream, bang the table or jump, she says.Others in the restaurant used to tut-tut or look at us with sympathy, which I hated. I thought people were being arrogant and started getting worried that I may not be able to take him anywhere.One day Geetha gathered the courage and walked across to a group of annoyed guests and told them that her child has a condition and asked if they could be understanding. They were very accepting, she says. I realised that it was ignorance and not arrogance that caused their earlier behaviour.She discussed with her husband Ratheesh P Subramaniam, also an advertising professional, and they decided to encourage inclusive friendships and start a drive.Ratheesh came up with the Supporticon, which is one smiley leaning against the other.Smile for a SmileA special child or a physically challenged person would break into a smile because someone has reached out in friendship and the other person would smile because they have made a special connection... one smile will support the other, she says. The Supporticon logo has a ribbon running through the two icons. The ribbon is to show a connecting bond between both the souls, says Geetha.The Supporticon was launched with a video for which Geetha reached out to Oms school for help. We asked his principal Santhi Karamchetti to put us in touch with special children and their parents, and she readily helped, says Geetha. The Spastics Society of Karnataka also joined forces.The icon went viral with people taking selfies with their new friends, seated back to back, and posting it on the Facebook page.Baking StartsThen Geethas school friend Mary Ann George, a baker, pitched the idea of #baketosupport. This was to get women bakers to bake a cake and gift it to a specially abled child or person. Mary Ann says, I have seen the many obstacles families with special children face and I wanted to do my bit to raise awareness... I am a baker and cakes are how I express myself better. So I thought of the #baketosupport campaign and approached all my baker friends who readily agreed. They were asked to include the Supporticon on all their contributions.Mary Ann, who is passionate about theme-based fondant cakes, made a three-tiered one with elaborate sugar art that shows children lost in their thoughts. It was on how special children are lost in their own thoughts and are often alone... my message was that when you see children with special needs lost in their own thoughts, dont step back. Step forward and try and be part of their world. Her cake will be displayed at corporate offices.Nirmala Arokia, a pastry chef at Pumpkinbakes in Jalahalli, says her best is Belgian chocolate cake followed by banana caramel cake. Nirmala baked her best Belgian chocolate cake with coffee buttercream and Ferrero Rocher crunch for Shalini Saraswathi, who is better known as the citys blade runner. Shalini, who is my sisters childhood friend, was a perfectly normal young woman where at the age of 32 she lost both her arms and her legs to an infection, says Nirmala. Her entire world came to a halt, people thought she would be bedridden for life, even asked her husband if he would remarry. But unlike any other, she rose above all of this... she leads a regular life and trains with an athlete to run 5K and 10K marathons... that is what I call a comeback. She is my biggest inspiration and role model.The lower tier of the cake has a pair of crutches, seemingly left behind, and on the upper tier is a girl flying away on golden wings.Moving ExperiencesAshel Sandeep, a cake artist at Ashels Baking Heaven in Whitefield, took a three-tiered cake to her neighbourhood school for disabled children. I thought I knew of all the problems faced by a special child or their parents, she says, but working on the cake made her realise how much more there was. It was a very emotional and educative experience... (through the cake baking and sharing) I could talk about it to a lot of people.Diya Haldipur gifted a choco-vanilla, two-layered fondant cake to an NGO, which she picked through an Internet search. Founder and cake artist at Itsy Bitsy Bytes, a home-baking venture in Malleswaram, Diya specialises in fondant cakes with edible toppers.(In the cake) I added edible toppers that showed two sets of friends where special needs didnt matter in friendship, she says. She also added the wordings The special friendship recipe - A pinch of patience, a dash of kindness, a spoonful of laughter and a heap of love."

""Who has given the right to them (to forecast)? You cannot believe their production numbers. They are misleading public and the industry by releasing wrong numbers. They should not be doing this,"" Paswan told reporters.The frequent revision of sugar output estimate for 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) puts in question the credibility of the industry body, he said. ""It is not fair to frequently revise the figures. We don't know what logic they have behind this. All -- farmers, mills and trade -- get affected because of such numbers.""Paswan said the ISMA has trimmed sugar production forecast to 20.3 million tonnes for 2016-17, down from a previous projection of 21.3 million tonnes made two months ago, and down from a September 2016 forecast of 23.4 million tonnes. Last year too, the industry body had initially project the output to be 28 million tonnes and later revised it downward to 25.1 million tonnes, he added.Urging the industry and public not to get misled with ISMA's incorrect projections, Paswan said, ""There is no shortage of sugar in the country. We have enough stocks and imports are not required.""The availability will be 29 million tonnes this year including the opening stock of 7.7 million tonnes and the likely production of 22.5 million tonnes in the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year, he said, adding this is sufficient to meet the the annual consumption of 24-25 million tonnes. ""Even if we take into account the ISMA's production estimate of 20.3 million tonnes, the availability will be 27.3 million tonnes, which is sufficient to meet the domestic demand,"" he added.Asked if import duty on raw sugar will be slashed from 40 per cent, he said, ""There is no question of imports. The status quo will remain."" Defending its data, ISMA President Sarita Reddy said, ""There is nothing wrong with our data. ...We are not hiding any facts. Whatever data we have got from satellite images and different state associations, we have passed it on to the government.""The downward revision of sugar output to 20.3 million tonnes for this year was mainly because of severe drought in some states like Maharashtra, where sugarcane yields were hit badly, she told PTI. The country has sufficient stocks and imports may not be required, she added."

His mannerism, his attitude, his approach to politics, without picking a gun, without firing a bullet, he transformed India and transformed the Commonwealth of Nations, and he triggered off a string of Independence across the Commonwealth countries that followed,"" Regrello said.Gandhi is of the same ilk as Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela, both of whom preached non-violence as a force for change, he added.Indian High Commissioner Bishwadip Dey said: ""Gandhi becomes much more relevant when his teachings of truth, non-violence and co-existence come in when you practice non-violence, when you practice truth, when you practice peace, there can be no crime situation.""Scores of people turned up to view the exhibition, including officials of the Indian High Commission.The observance of Gandhi's birth and death has become an annual ritual in Trinidad and Tobago, particularly when more than 44 per cent of the population form the Indian diaspora whose forefathers hailed from what is now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar between 1845 and 1917 to work in the sugar and cocoa plantations."

""India implemented UN-mandated sanctions against Iran and generally cooperated with multilateral efforts to use sanctions to achieve a nuclear agreement with Iran,"" the report which was presented to lawmakers yesterday.CRS is the independent research wing of the US Congress which prepares periodic report on issues of interest for lawmakers for them to make informed decisions. Its report are not considered as official report of the US Congress. In its 42-page report CRS notes that during 2010-2016, India's private sector described Iran as a ""controversial market""  a term used by many international firms to describe markets that entail reputational and financial risks.In January 2012, Iran agreed to accept India's local currency rupee to settle 45 per cent of its oil sales to India, which Iran mostly used to buy Indian wheat, pharmaceuticals, rice, sugar, soybeans, auto parts and other products. ""India reduced its imports of Iranian oil substantially after 2011 - by the time of the JPA, Iran was only supplying about six per cent of India's oil imports, down from over 16 per cent in 2008.India incurred significant costs to retrofit refineries that were handling Iranian crude. However, since the JCPOA, oil imports apparently have increased to close to 2011 levels,"" the report said. Indian firms ended or slowed work on investments in Iranian oil and gas fieldswork that is likely to resume now that sanctions have been lifted, CRS said, adding that India and Iran are considering using Turkey's Halkbank to transfer to Iran USD 6.5 billion for oil purchased by India during 2012-2016. In 2015, India and Iran agreed that India would help develop Iran's Chahbahar port that would enable it to trade with Afghanistan unimpeded by Pakistan.""With sanctions on Iran now lifted, that project no longer entails risk to Indian firms involved. In May 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Iran and signed an agreement to invest USD 500 million in developing the port and related infrastructure,"" CRS said.The report said one test of Pakistan's compliance with sanctions was a pipeline project that would carry Iranian gas to Pakistan  a project that US officials on several occasions stated would be subject to ISA sanctions. ""Despite that threat, agreement on the USD 7 billion project was finalised on June 12, 2010, and construction was formally inaugurated in a ceremony attended by the Presidents of both countries on March 11, 2013,"" it said."

The article is about how researchers and doctors had solved the mystery of why children in Bihars Muzzafarpur had been dying. The answer: Toxins in the lychee fruit grown there, when consumed by malnourished children who had skipped their evening meal, caused a dip in blood sugar levels leading to serious illness and subsequently death. The doctors advised mothers to ensure the children ate and that they avoided consuming the fruit on an empty stomach. The article, based on a paper published in the Lancet, has garnered much attention.However, behind the mystery exists the simple truth that in 2017, a large chunk of Indias childrenand adultsremain hungry and malnourished. According to the National Family Health Survey, 37 per cent of children under the age of five are stunted. This figure is frequently is forgotten, amidst the technological and developmental leaps pockets of the country have made in recent years.It is perhaps because of these leaps the governments social sector spending has escaped close scrutiny. Addressing malnutrition would mean acknowledging malnutrition and envisaging a response to it. However, while India does have some schemes, the ICDS for one, that work towards addressing these issues between leakages and limited allocations, these programmes are stymied.An analysis by the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability says that while the programme has seen a 13 per cent increase in allocationafter cuts in the previous two budgetsit remains underfunded as cost norms have not been revised ... as per current market prices. Similar is the fate of other schemes aimed at tackling hunger and malnutrition. So while the lychee deaths may appear to be about toxins, in reality it is about deprivation and a hunger that robs our childrenand nationof health, life and potential."

Well, summer is back, with the mercury hitting new highs since the first week of the month and humidity melting us all into a puddle. And March is not even over! It is going to get worse with the massive loss of tree cover in the city, thanks to Vardah that stormed into the city with a vengeance. CE reporters and photographers take a walk through Chennais hot-spots (pun intended) to give you a glimpse of how the city is coping...Juice ItGoing out between 10 am and 5 pm is an indomitable task during summer. While most of us have the luxury of planning our day around the availability of AC rooms and malls, daily wage labourers, and also street vendors toil away in the sun. Those who sell green coconut, fruit juices and freshly cut fruits, provide relief to the commuters and pedestrians, but they themselves have no place to hide from the harsh sun. Fruit juice shops, road-side kamman kuzhu stalls, buttermilk stalls and rickshaws fi lled with green coconut are common in most parts of the city. What better way to beat the heat than to binge drink on these healthy supplements? With `10 a bowl, fruits and juices keep us hydrated and cools down excess body heat.The Beach For Its LoversDuring Chennai veyil, be wary of getting a tan or worse a sun burn! Many youngsters cover their faces with stoles, cotton gloves and dupattas, especially those riding twowheelers. Radiation can cause blisters and rashes on the exposed areas especially the hands, and even dermatologists suggest gloves while riding or even walking in the sun. As we have studied in our primary schools, it is better to wear cotton dresses than nylon or silk, as the latter might stick to the body because of excessive sweating during summer and cause irritation. Talking about suntans, most today have veered towards natural remedies such as rose-water-lime, turmeric-lime and tomato juice-lime. As the temperature increases, the chances of a sun burn are high. Make sure to cool down as quickly as possible. Keep yourself hydrated, and moisturise the area while its damp and consult a doctor for help at the earliest to avoid severe infections.No Bliss, But Blisters!We Chennaiites dont need a weather update to know that summer is fast approaching. Though many of us prefer to stay indoors, its tradition to visit our beaches  from Marina to Bessy and beyond. Well, defi nitely not to show off the summer bod, but to take a refreshing dip, a quick stroll along the warm sand shore and stopping for some mang-kadalai, sugarcane juice and fresh fruits, later! Even at noon, under the hot sun, our beaches seem crowded with people taking shelter under the carts and kattamarams. But as heat-humidity becomes more oppressive, beaches do get deserted with fewer beach lovers and couples.Time To HyderateAnimals and birds in our neighbourhood too need some clean and fresh water. I am sure every summer, we might have seen birds drink the tiny drops of water that leak from taps or dogs and cats drink from street gutters. Why not help these animals cool down a bit? This summer, collect some water in a clean bowl and leave it on your terrace and outside your gate for your feathered and four-legged friends. This might help them quench their thirst from time to time. Dogs and cats are usually on the look-out to rest in cool shady places; make place for them under your car or your garage. If you own a dog or a cat, and decide to take them along with you for some grocery shopping, DO NOT lock them up in the car with the windows open or closed, they may lose their lives because of the heat trapped within. Avoid taking them out for a walk when the heat is at its peak. Give your dog a trim and brush their fur regularly; it helps them stay cool. For your caged pets, like hamsters, birds, and squirrelsleave their cages in a low-sun area. Let all our pawpals, petpals and community animals and birds have a safe and happy summer!"

In fact, Meteorological Department has recorded highest temperatures during those hours.When one does not consume adequate fluids, electrolytes (Potassium, Calcium, Sodium etc), one gets exposed to heat, which the body is not acclimatized to and it leads to electrolyte imbalance, hypotension (low blood pressure), hyperprexia (body temperature crosses 106 degrees). These symptoms may cause people to faint.Extreme fatigue, thirst, cramps, giddiness are signs of sun stroke. If it is unavoidable for people to go out during the afternoon, they should cover themselves to avoid the sun.Wear light coloured clothes, made of cotton, said Dr BSV Manjula, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital.During peak hours, people should avoid sugar drinks and opt for salted drinks, said Dr M Goverdhan, senior consultant, CARE Hospitals.

Daiwik Hotel where I stayed, was offering packages to places like Shani Shingnapur, Nashik, Aurangabad (Ajanta & Ellora) etc. I chose to visit Shani Shingnapur as it was recently in the news, having lifted the ban on womens entry, yielding to a high- voltage campaign by activists. The temple trust recently allowed women to enter the sanctum sanctorum, breaking the tradition followed for several decades. Shingnapur is also famous for the fact that no house in the village has doors, only door frames. Villagers believe that god Shani punishes anyone attempting theft. I was quite curious to see this village and know more about the place.So, I set out in the cab arranged by the hotel, accompanied by Digambar. During the two hour ride, every now and then I would spot a Rasavanthy on the way. You may wonder what Rasavanthy is. It is the name given to sugarcane juice in these parts! When you see a multitude of colourful balloons hanging from trees, with a few swings by the side decorated with bunches of colourful balloons, bright red plastic chairs neatly placed in a row, then youll find a bull cheerfully going in circles while a wooden contraption neatly extracts fresh sugarcane juice. Well, thats a Rasavanthy stall. Youll find them in rural Maharashtra, amidst onion, corn and sugarcane fields.Tukaram, the cab driver extolled the merits of sugarcane juice thus extracted versus the juice produced by an electric machine. He insisted that it is much tastier and doesnt turn black even after an hour. I stopped at one of the stalls, to take pictures and videos of a cheerful, patient bull that was relentlessly working to get gallons of the sweet juice for human consumption. We sat under the tall trees, surrounded by the festive decorations. I had the most delicious sugarcane juice I ever tasted, with an equally sweet sounding name - Rasavanthy.Drunk on the sweet juice, as I was slipping into a slumber, Tukaram started to narrate the story of Shani Shingnapur. The deity here is Shani, a Swayambhu that had self- emerged from earth many centuries ago, in the form of a black, imposing stone. Legend says that when a shepherd touched the stone with a pointed rod, the stone started bleeding.On that night Lord Shanaishwara appeared in the dream of the pious shepherd and directed him to build a temple without the roof, as he preferred to be under the open sky. He asked the shepherd to do daily pooja and Tailabhisheka every Saturday without fail. In return, he promised to make the village free of dacoits and thieves.As we reached the village I started looking at every house curiously. True, there were no doors anywhere. As we stopped the car to take some pictures, Amol, a cheerful young lad with a sunny smile offered to show us around. His two grandmothers, Sakku Bai and Tulja Bai were sitting on the porch of their house, busy talking and laughing as many kids were playing around Amol said they all live under one roof, more than 25 of them in their family.I could see the happiness in their faces and the joyfulness in the children. Sakku Bai, his maternal grandmother laughed heartily when I said her necklace was looking nice. Then Tulja Bai showed hers and received the same compliments from me and everyone burst out laughing. As we went around, Vittal Borude, the matriarch of a house was sitting in the warm sun, playing with his grandchildren. His wife Vimala said that she came as a bride, to this house with no doors. No one in the village seemed to have ever seen a door in their houses. We passed a tailor shop in a garage with no shutter. The tailor said he covers the threshold with a cloth in the night, after closing the shop. In the busy shopping complex too there were no doors or shutters in the shops. The goods are left as they are in the night, only to resume business in the morning.We went to the temple complex, which is quite huge and impressive. There is a specified place for devotees to place their offerings like rock salt, black til and oil on a wired a mesh. The oil gets drained and collected in a tank below, which is again pumped up, to fall on the top of the stone idol of Shani Bhagawan, through a pipe. I was quite impressed by this modernised abhishekam that eliminates any mess that is created by the oil offerings. Back at the hotel, I had one more gastronomic experience, which is typically Maharashtrian. The huge Marathi Thali consisted of Matki, Pithla, Baigan, Bhendi Masala, Aloo Jeera, Yellow Dal Tadka, Koshambari, Shrikhand, Paratha, Rice, Papad, Pickle and Thecha. I could hardly breathe after eating just one-fourth of the thali. Thats when I gave up, realising that one needs the appetite of a warrior to tackle it!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; blogs at www.vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

There are no regular pay hikes, no PF and no medical insurance.They get reimbursements only for treatment of cancer, kidney ailments, heart conditions and hysterectomies, says Sunanda HS, general secretary of the Karnataka Rajya Anganwadi Noukarara Sangha. What is the point if they pay only for life threatening conditions. We want to live, not die, she adds.Its this determination that has brought these women from across Karnataka, as they put up with a lone, stinking and clogged toilet at Freedom Park, no water or blankets and only each other and mosquitoes for company.They have decided to stay put till the government takes up their case.Jyothi A of the National Federation of Indian Women says the problem is anganwadi workers and helpers are not treated as government staff and have no legal status. They dont even undergo any basic training to run the creches.According to Karnataka Rajya Anganwadi Noukarara Sangha, there are 1.24 lakh anganwadi workers in the state. Their job entails providing nutrition to children under six years, pregnant and lactating mothers, and girls. Pre-school education of children between three and six years is also their responsibility.We have to maintain registers, take care of the children from making them sleep, attend natures calls, cooking and feeding them.

This iconic eatery had shut shop on Wednesday because of a scarcity of meat.According to a Scroll.in report, Tunday Kababi had its four slaughterhouses sealed between 2013 and 2015. The report further elaborated that the buffalo meat serving outlet in Akbari Gate was shut, but the one serving chicken and mutton in Aminabad remained open.It is to be noted that UP is a state where cow, bullock and ox slaughter is banned, but buffaloes can be killed.Mohammad Usman, the owner, was quoted in the report saying that the supply of mutton and chicken had not been affected so far, but expressed apprehension about the overall meat shortage in the state. With large quantities of kababs that get produced every single day in Lucknow (estimated to be in tonnes), goat meat or chicken alone can't fulfil the demand. Buffalo meat has been traditionally used to make this Awadhi cuisine.Meat shortage has been the growing worry in Uttar Pradesh, a state which has an estimated 52.9% non-vegetarians, due to the new chief minister Yogi Adityanath's directives of shutting down of illegal abattoirs. Lucknow has already begun to face the heat of this with the civic body sealing nine meat shops so far.Lucknow is well known for its Mughlai -Awadhi cuisine, with non-veg kebabs dominating the recommended eatery list in the lanes and bylanes of the City of Nawabs. The city's tourism, in fact, thrives on this rich gourmet.According to National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data findings, the total quantity of buffalo meat consumed per month had decreased from 1.25 crore kg in 1999-2000 to 90.5 lakh kg in 2011-12. It also reveals that the state where Mohammad Akhlaq was lynched in 2015 when suspected of storing beef at his home, has the highest number of Muslims eating buffalo meat  1.73 crore  followed by West Bengal (1.5 crore) and Assam (57 lakh).In a media interview last year, Chaudhary Ahleh Umar Qureshi, the U.P. secretary of All India Jamiatul Quresh, which has traditionally been engaged as butchers was quoted saying, 60-70 per cent of those who eat buffalo meat in the form of Lucknows famous kababs, may not get recorded in the above data since they are not consumed at home.Despite NSSO recording a decline in beef and buffalo meat consumption over the last decade in UP, Lucknow's kababs still require meat.Ever since Yogi Adityanath's swearing-in on March 19, the state has carried out several raids and began the process of shutting down slaughterhouses. According to Lucknow Municipal Corporation, this drive has been launched across 11 districts so far.The mouth-watering Tunday kebabs incorporate 160 spices. Ingredients include finely minced lamb or buffalo meat, plain yogurt, garam masala, grated ginger, crushed garlic, ground cardamom, powdered cloves, melted ghee, dried mint, small onions cut into rings, vinegar, sugar, lime. Does this make your mouth water?"

No one has the time. They just come, order, get their snacks packed and leave to reach office on time. It is a different experience.The outlet opened about two months ago. Sujata Chittiapa, another managing partner says, We studied the station for two months. We observed the crowd that came in. After the connectivity to Mysuru Road, the crowd has increased and it turned out to be better for us.The eatery is open from 9 am to 10.30 pm, until the last train arrives.Goutom claims that the footfall per day is about 1,800 to 2,000. On week days, there are office goers. On weekends, it is usually less as most of them would be families and those who are on joy rides. We earn about Rs 7-9 lakh a month and we pay a rent to BMRCL of about Rs 1.15 lakh, he says.The outlet serves snacks such as vada pav, sandwiches, dahi vada, cakes and hot beverages - tea and coffee.They would soon be including different varieties of tea too.Topped with boondi, their dahi vada is as fresh as it can get. Dipped in a sea of curd, the vada is moist and melts in your mouth as soon as you take a bite.He says, Our specialities are sandwiches, dahi vada, vada pav and cutlets. There are three Mumbaikaars who come here every weekend to have our vada pav. They say this is the closest to the one they get in Mumbai. And it truly does tastes like an authentic Mumbai Vada pav.All items except the bakery confectionaries that includes puff are prepared in batches in their centralised kitchen in C V Raman Nagar, which is just half a kilometre away from the station, he says.Sujata adds, We make food in batches of 30. Once, the items get over. We inform the cooks and within half an hour, a new batch arrives. They are also priced reasonably. The bakery items are outsourced from our friend who owns a bakery.Sujata adds, I am also a dietician. I have always been connected to the food industry. We do not pre-mix sugar in our tea or coffee as there might be some customers who are diabetics too. We provide them sugar separately. Some complain about it while some prefer it.Particular about the hygiene, Goutom challenges, You can walk in to our kitchen anytime without any prior notice and see the hygiene we maintain.If you are a cheese fan, you should definitely try their tomato and cheese sandwich."

In the Assembly polls this time, the post-demonetisation Modi magic had sidelined developmental issues. Little progress has been made on schemes such as roads, agriculture and railways. With Adityanath at the helm in the state when the next Lok Sabha elections fall due in 2019, the BJP hopes the Hindutva factor will help it retain most of its 71 MPs, or even better the figure.After Gujarat, UP is the next laboratory for the RSS, which approves of Adityanath wholeheartedly. In the context of the changed demographics in Western UP, where the Muslim population has burgeoned, Yogi Adityanaths clout in the east along with the Hindutva counter-effect in neighbouring states such as Bihar will give the party a leg-up. As far as Yogi is concerned, being chief minister will enable him to put his fiefdom of Purvanchal on the development map by working closely with Delhi.amit bandreThe Modi-Adityanath combination as a single powerful image to capture UP in 2019 will benefit both parties. Adityanaths Hindutva agenda will obscure any development concerns and push forward the BJPs poll chariot from Gorakhpur through Ayodhya to Delhi.Its his chance to consolidate his grip on the backward Purvanchal region. Eastern UP has been languishing on the growth index though the Mahants charisma remains unaffected. When Modi visited the Yogi at his math late last year, he had cleared the setting up of a new AIIMS for Gorakhpur, a fertiliser project and many road projects.Numerous sugar factories of eastern UP had been lying idle for many years because of the focus on Western UP by Mayawati and Akhilesh.If Yogi revives the sugar belt, it will add to his lustre. Because Purvanchal is close to Nepal, there is no infrastructure to stop flooding. This is a challenge Adityanath has to meet.In 2019, the Opposition is envisaging a grand alliance against the BJP in the North, including UP. Adityanath is seen as the BJPs best bet to prevent the fragmentation of the Hindu vote in the manner the Modi magic had in UP this time.Besides, of the 312 MLAs in the BJP, 165 are either Brahmins or Thakurs. Yogi power has the mojo to keep all castes, including OBCs, in check. For this, he will have the help of OBC leader BP Maurya and Brahmin leader Dinesh Sharma-both deputy CMs."

After three days of confabulations, the CM finally decided to keep home portfolio himself along with finance and handed over two other key portfolios -PWD and Higher Education -to his two deputies Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma respectively.All this long, the corridors of power were rife with speculations that Deputy CM Keshav Maurya was making a pitch for Home.The CM, however, much against the convention, done away with the second key portfolio after Home - Finance-by handing it over to a relatively low-profile Cabinet Minister Rajesh Agrawal. Interestingly, Agarwal might have been chosen for his acumen for finances as he has been UP BJP treasurer for a long time.To have the bureaucracy under his direct control, the CM has also retained Secretariat Administration, Personnel and Appointment departments. Similarly, by keeping Information, Revenue, Housing and Urban Planning and Food and Civil Supplies with him, Yogi has sent the signals that he means business.The other important portfolios like Public Works Department (PWD) has gone to deputy CM Keshav Maurya. In the previous Akhilesh government, it was held by uncle Shivpal for good four years after which he was sacked by the ex-CM owing to family feud and also complaints of irregularities.Notably, Mathura MLA and BJP chief Amit Shah's favourite Shrikant Sharma has been given the reins of Energy while PMs experiment boy Siddharth Nath Singh has been entrusted with Health departments responsibility.The other deputy of Yogi, Dr Dinesh Sharma, a professor of commerce at Lucknow university, has been suitable chosen to head Secondary & Higher Education, Science and Technology and Information and Technology departments. Among the turncoats, while Rita Bahuguna Joshi will look after Women and Family Welfare and Women, Child Welfare and Tourism, SPS Baghel has got Animal Husbandry, Swami Prasad Maurya will head Labour, Urban Employement and Poverty Eradication and Brajesh Pathak has got his hands full with Law and Legal Services, Additional Energy Resources and Political Pension.Interestingly, eight-time MLA from Shajahanpur, who was also a frontrunner in the race for the top post of UP, Suresh Khanna will take care of key portfolios like Parliamentary Affairs, Urban Development and Urban Integrated Development. However, the lone Bhumihar in Yogi cabinet, Surya Pratap Shahi will be the new Agriculture, Agriculture Education and Agricultural Research minister of the state. Senior lodh (backward) leader of the party Dharam Pal Singh has got Irrigation. Before Keshav Mauryas appointment as BJP chief, Dharam Pal was touted to be the partys chief in UP.Former Test cricketer with 40 Test caps and Cabinet Minister Chetan Chauhan has aptly been given Sports and Youth Welfare. Former Health Minister Ramapati Shastri has got Social Welfare, Scheduled Caste and Tribe Welfare and Jai Prakash Singh has got Excise and Prohibition. Alliance partner and Cabinet Minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has got Backward Welfare and Handicap Welfare.While Maharajpur MLA and Cabinet Minister Satish Mahana has bagged Industrial Development possible as he comes from Kanpur, Manchaster of East. Similarly, Transport has gone to Minister of State (independent charge) Swatantra Deo Singh. Singh is the Kurmi face of the party. He is neither an MLA nor MLC but has made it to Yogis cabinet owing to his closeness with party chief Amit Shah and UP organising secretary Sunil Bansal. However, Singhs his hard work was acknowledged dueing elections as he organised rallies of PM Narendra Modi. Swatantra Deo has also been given the charge of Protocol department and would assist Srikant Sharma as MoS in Energy department.Muzaffarnagar riot accused MLA Suresh Rana, however, has been given Cane Development and Sugarmills. Rana comes from western UP, the sugar bowl of the state. He would also assist Satish Mahana as MoS Industrial Development.First time MLA and state chief of BJP womens wing, Swati Singh whose political career is barely a few months old, has got NRI Department, Agricultural Export, Agricultural Foreign Trade and MoS for Women, Family and Child Welfare. Interestingly, Swati Singh, probably is the only MoS (Independent Charge) with maximum number of portfolios.Despite having a Mulsim minister in his cabinet, Yogi decided to hand over Minority Affairs to Baldev Olakh, a Sikh minister who comes from Azam Khans Rampur. However, the lone Muslim minister Mohsin Raza would look after Muslim Waqf and Haj.Surprisingly, all the departments related to education have gone to ex-CM Kalyan Singhs grandson and Atrauli MLA Sandeep Singh. He has been given the responsibility of Primary, Secondary, Higher, Technical and Medical Education as MoS."

While sugarcane grown in the last kharif season is yet to be harvested, the target area for the crop in the current rabi season has been increased by almost 300 hectares (ha).Harvesting has been stopped as the State-owned Bargarh Cooperative Sugar Mills that procures the entire sugarcane stock from farmers has been closed down by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) from November last year. Farmers, who had taken loans to grow the crop, said they cannot harvest until the sugar mill reopens.They are also apprehensive that delay in harvesting can result in decline in crop weight and sweetness, reducing its market value. Harvesting and crushing of sugarcane usually begins in December.The sugarcane mill, which is the lone such facility in Bargarh, was closed down by the CPCB following violation of pollution control norms.According to the reports of the Agriculture Department, a target was set to grow sugarcane in 1,000 ha of land but being a water-intensive crop, it could be cultivated in 750 ha in the last kharif season. Subsequently, it was planned to increase the area of cultivation to 1,350 ha in the current rabi season with introduction of Sustainable Sugarcane Initiative, Ratoon Management (Ratooning is a practice of growing a crop from the stubbles of previous crop) and the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) under State Plan.The farmers said crushing of sugarcane normally begins in December and harvesting at the right time not only ensures high sweetness content in the crop but also right weight. They are already three months beyond the schedule and at this stage, they are apprehensive that their crops will be rejected for procurement.A delegation of the farmers called on Bargarh Collector Anjan Kumar Manik on February 27 and urged him to facilitate opening of the sugar mill. However, he expressed helplessness as the sugar mill has been closed by CPCB due to non-adherence of norms.Regional Officer of Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB), Sambalpur, Hemendra Nath Naik informed that the CPCB had shut down the sugar mill and they had little role to play in it except forwarding the compliance report. He said the sugar mill has already complied with the shortcomings and a report in this regard has been forwarded by him to the CPCB.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das admitted to the fact that sweetness content in sugarcane will decline if harvesting is delayed. He said there has been a decline in sugarcane cultivation in the district as there is no scope to market it commercially.If the crushing capacity of the sugar mill is increased, more farmers will evince interest to grow sugarcane, he added."

I have failed to revive the defunct sugar mills due to bureaucratic non-cooperation and indifference of the department.Rout said, I am pained that most of the members of this House refer me as the most efficient. But in reality, I am not allowed to function as hurdles are put on my way. Referring to bureaucratic interference in the functioning of the department, he said, It is very difficult to run a democratic Government under bureaucratic influence.The Minister said he did not get adequate support from the bureaucracy to take up welfare programmes, be it revival of defunct sugar mills or cold storages which could help farmers to a great extent.Making a statement, the Minister said out of the five sugar mills in the State only two are in operation. Remaining three mills have been closed due to several factors and his efforts to revive these units have faced hurdles from the bureaucracy.The Minister, however, assured the House that he would again try to make the defunct sugar mills operational. He agreed to a suggestion from Leader of the Opposition Narasingh Mishra to convene a high-level meeting in which Mishra will also be invited to discuss the issue and find out ways to revive defunct sugar mills.Mishra alleged that the State Government failed to help the sugarcane farmers. He said the farmers do not get their dues from the sugar mills run by the cooperative societies.He demanded that steps be taken to revive the Vijayananda Cooperative Sugar Mills at Sagarpally in Balangir district. He alleged that the cooperative sugar mill at Bargarh has also become almost defunct because of indifferent attitude of the Government.Congress chief whip Taraprasad Bahinipati and Nabakishore Das also criticised the Government for not having any policy for sugarcane growers of the State."

After three days of confabulations, the CM finally decided to keep home portfolio himself along with finance and handed over two other key portfolios -PWD and Higher Education -to his two deputies Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma respectively.All this long, the corridors of power were rife with speculations that Deputy CM Keshav Maurya was making a pitch for Home.The CM, however, much against the convention, done away with the second key portfolio after Home - Finance-by handing it over to a relatively low-profile Cabinet Minister Rajesh Agrawal. Interestingly, Agarwal might have been chosen for his acumen for finances as he has been UP BJP treasurer for a long time.To have the bureaucracy under his direct control, the CM has also retained Secretariat Administration, Personnel and Appointment departments. Similarly, by keeping Information, Revenue, Housing and Urban Planning and Food and Civil Supplies with him, Yogi has sent the signals that he means business.The other important portfolios like Public Works Department (PWD) has gone to deputy CM Keshav Maurya. In the previous Akhilesh government, it was held by uncle Shivpal for good four years after which he was sacked by the ex-CM owing to family feud and also complaints of irregularities.Notably, Mathura MLA and BJP chief Amit Shah's favourite Shrikant Sharma has been given the reins of Energy while PMs experiment boy Siddharth Nath Singh has been entrusted with Health departments responsibility.The other deputy of Yogi, Dr Dinesh Sharma, a professor of commerce at Lucknow university, has been suitable chosen to head Secondary & Higher Education, Science and Technology and Information and Technology departments. Among the turncoats, while Rita Bahuguna Joshi will look after Women and Family Welfare and Women, Child Welfare and Tourism, SPS Baghel has got Animal Husbandry, Swami Prasad Maurya will head Labour, Urban Employement and Poverty Eradication and Brajesh Pathak has got his hands full with Law and Legal Services, Additional Energy Resources and Political Pension.Interestingly, eight-time MLA from Shajahanpur, who was also a frontrunner in the race for the top post of UP, Suresh Khanna will take care of key portfolios like Parliamentary Affairs, Urban Development and Urban Integrated Development. However, the lone Bhumihar in Yogi cabinet, Surya Pratap Shahi will be the new Agriculture, Agriculture Education and Agricultural Research minister of the state. Senior lodh (backward) leader of the party Dharam Pal Singh has got Irrigation. Before Keshav Mauryas appointment as BJP chief, Dharam Pal was touted to be the partys chief in UP.Former Test cricketer with 40 Test caps and Cabinet Minister Chetan Chauhan has aptly been given Sports and Youth Welfare. Former Health Minister Ramapati Shastri has got Social Welfare, Scheduled Caste and Tribe Welfare and Jai Prakash Singh has got Excise and Prohibition. Alliance partner and Cabinet Minister Om Prakash Rajbhar has got Backward Welfare and Handicap Welfare.While Maharajpur MLA and Cabinet Minister Satish Mahana has bagged Industrial Development possible as he comes from Kanpur, Manchaster of East. Similarly, Transport has gone to Minister of State (independent charge) Swatantra Deo Singh. Singh is the Kurmi face of the party. He is neither an MLA nor MLC but has made it to Yogis cabinet owing to his closeness with party chief Amit Shah and UP organising secretary Sunil Bansal. However, Singhs his hard work was acknowledged dueing elections as he organised rallies of PM Narendra Modi. Swatantra Deo has also been given the charge of Protocol department and would assist Srikant Sharma as MoS in Energy department.Muzaffarnagar riot accused MLA Suresh Rana, however, has been given Cane Development and Sugarmills. Rana comes from western UP, the sugar bowl of the state. He would also assist Satish Mahana as MoS Industrial Development.First time MLA and state chief of BJP womens wing, Swati Singh whose political career is barely a few months old, has got NRI Department, Agricultural Export, Agricultural Foreign Trade and MoS for Women, Family and Child Welfare. Interestingly, Swati Singh, probably is the only MoS (Independent Charge) with maximum number of portfolios.Despite having a Mulsim minister in his cabinet, Yogi decided to hand over Minority Affairs to Baldev Olakh, a Sikh minister who comes from Azam Khans Rampur. However, the lone Muslim minister Mohsin Raza would look after Muslim Waqf and Haj.Surprisingly, all the departments related to education have gone to ex-CM Kalyan Singhs grandson and Atrauli MLA Sandeep Singh. He has been given the responsibility of Primary, Secondary, Higher, Technical and Medical Education as MoS."

The cabinet also gave its nod to rename Agra and Gorakhpur airports to Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Guru Gorakshnath airport respectively.The State cabinet also decided to allocate land for the Centres project to open around 20 Agriculture Scientific Research Centres across the State.While the name of the department for physically challenged people was changed from Viklang Jan Vikas Vibhag to Divyang Jan Vikas department, the cabinet also decided to make the film on the life of Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia called 'Ek rani thi aisi bhi', tax-free.Speaking to media persons after the cabinet meeting that lasted less than an hour as compared to the previous two meetings which lasted over two hours, the State governments official spokesman and power minister Shrikant Sharma said that the government had completed one month in office and proved that it was a pro-farmer dispensation.Elaborating on removing sugar cane from the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna, he said it was done as sugarcane is a cash crop. It was included in the scheme by the Akhilesh-led Uttar Pradesh government and was objected to by the Modi-led government at the Centre.So we decided to remove it from the scheme, he said.Spelling out further details of the crop insurance policy, Shrikant Sharma said that the State would be divided into 12 clusters. Each insurance company would not be allowed more than two clusters to operate in.On the proposed agriculture scientific research centres, health minister and government spokesman Siddharthnath Singh said the State had 69 such centres, as of now. However, a decision was taken to open 20 more centres.Similarly, the cabinet also decided that four districts instead of two districts each, would be selected for organic farming of banana and chilli."

The attacks are on the rise after the recent shootout incident where a resident of Doddahalli was shot dead.Fearing more attacks, the foresters have suspended patrolling duties in the sanctuary. The foresters who retaliated a shooting group and killed a poacher are now demanding police protection for them and their family members.On Monday, the staff from Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary and surrounding divisions met the Wildlife Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF) Sugara Kishen Singh at Aranya Bhavan in Malleswaram and requested protection from villagers and anti- social elements who are instigating the attacks.Problems for foresters began after the stringent action they took on the night of March 16. The cross firing took place during night hours and on the morning of March 17, the body of Gurumurthy from Doddahalli was discovered at the shooting place along with a rifle and poached wildlife.This is not the first time poachers and smugglers have got political connections in Kanakapura and Ramanagara. Earlier, the forests along the Cauvery river were not given the status of sanctuary and poaching was regular in these areas. After the forests were included as wildlife sanctuary, protection measures were improved. New anti-poaching camps were set up at crucial points inside the sanctuary.Several trade routes between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were shut to curb the illegal smuggling of wildlife contraband and other banned substances such as alcohol.Hence the death of a person in a shooting has given a chance to anti-social elements to go against the foresters.Wildlife PCCF Sugara Singh said higher officials in the police department have been explained about the situation and action will be taken on other poachers who were present in the forest on the night of March 16. We are collecting the weapon information from the villages that are located on the fringes, the officer added."

While the new broom sweeps clean, old dirt tends to stick fast. A look at what the new chief minister of UP has done so far, not done yet, and what hed up against.WHAT HES DONE1. Slaughterhouse down: True to his pre-poll pitch, Adityanath lost no time in shutting down slaughterhouses, triggering ripples across north India. Meat traders, particularly Qureish Muslims, are not pleased.2. Promised, waived: His first cabinet meeting wrote off crop loans up to Rs 1 lakh for small and marginal farmers. Its a burden of Rs 3600 crore but 86 lakh farmers like it.3. Cane he do it: Arrears owed to sugarcane farmers cleared. Millers have to pay up in 14 days or else.4. Love flees Lucknow: With anti-Romeo squads triggering vigilante policing of public spaces, romance has vanished from Lucknows parks.5. Goodbye to spitsville: He doesnt like pan-stained corridors so government officers have switched to slurping toffees instead.6. Biometric office timing: Good god, youve got to be in office by 9.30 am.7. Power for All MoU: 24X7 power supply to district HQs, 20 hours to lesser towns.8. No pothole by June 15: PWD babus are in a tizzy trying to meet Yogis deadline of June 15 to make 85 lakh km of roads smooth like Hema Malinis cheeks.9. No holidays on neta anniversaries: UP has 37 gazetted and 18 restricted holidays. Now hes gone and pruned it. No more holidays at the drop of a Gandhi topi.10.Blast the past: Probes ordered into high-profile dream projects of the previous regime: Gomti Riverfront, Jai Prakash Narain International Centre and urban development scams in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna E-way Development Authority.11.Muslim charm offensive: Marriage of 100 poor Muslim girls annually, English, science and math at madarsas, and what not.12.Assault on triple talaq: Opinion being built up against Muslim divorce systemWHAT HES NOT DONE1. Officers assets: After lots of foot dragging, ministers did declare their assets but the babus are still holding out.2. Slow on secretariat: The CM wants only neutral officers for his secretariat. So only three officials are in place  Mritunjai Kumar Narain, Rigzin Samphel and Amit Singh. The rest are Akhilesh aides still in tenure.3. Lucknow door ast: Officers in the capital may be on their toes but elsewhere its languor as usual.NOW THE HARD PART1. Remember Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas?: Adityanath is at pains to stress hes the CM of all but his hard Hindutva image casts a shadow, especially in the eyes of the minority community. The slaughterhouse crackdown and the triple talaq initiative, and the Meerut vigilantism have left the Muslims wary. Hes some way from winning Muslim hearts and minds.2. Bijli, sadak paani: Winning a big majority is the easy part. Supplying potable water, uninterrupted power supply and medicare for all and irrigation for farmers are hard nuts to crack.3. Reining in the cow vigilantes: The Yogis hardest challenge in office will be to keep his own friends on a leash on cow protection, love jihad, etc.4. Funding the giveaways: Loan waivers and power surcharge exemptions cost money and will temper the state governments investment plans.5.Kickstart industry: Investment in UP went to sleep under Akhileshs watch and now Yogis need is to create an atmosphere conducive to industry and business. Not easy."

The Kerala model of tourism went for a toss.The new policy has affected the likes of CGH Earth, which was attracting tourists by marketing the states unique tourism model. At one-stroke, Kerala became a 5-star hotel based tourism destination, which the state never was, and never will be, said Dominic.He said Sri Lanka, Rajasthan and Goa have benefitted from the states liquor policy, which drove away foreign tourists. MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) and wedding-based tourism also suffered big time.The Association of Approved and Classified Hotels of Kerala has submitted a wish list to the government. It includes:Allow liquor licence to all classified and approved hotels paying a luxury tax of minimum Rs 6 lakh per annum. Permit liquor to be served in licensed premises from 11 am to midnight instead of 6 am to 10 pm.Allow liquor to be served in multiple restaurants, banquet halls, poolside and rooftop of hotels, resorts and bars without additional fees. Reduce the one-day licence fee to Rs 10,000 and introduce online licences.Grant beer/wine licence to classified and approved restaurants at a lesser fee.The most significant suggestion by the industry is to promote a Kerala brand liquor (manufactured by the government) made from toddy, fruit and sugarcane similar to beverages made in Sri Lanka and China. This will definitely help in creating employment and revenue to the state, said association president G Gopinath.Earlier this year, the Association of British Travel Agents in its Travel Trends Report 2017 placed Kerala in the eighth position in the top 12 destinations to visit this year ahead of South Africa, Vietnam and the US. But things are not rosy on the ground. Unless a tourism-friendly liquor policy is announced, we are doomed, said an industry veteran."

I have failed to revive the defunct sugar mills due to bureaucratic non- cooperation and indifference of the department.""Rout said he was pained that most members of the House referred him as the most efficient. But, in reality, I am not allowed to function as hurdles are put on my way,"" he said.Referring to bureaucratic interference in the functioning of the department, he said, ""It is very difficult to run a democratic government under bureaucratic influence.""The minister said he did not get adequate support from the bureaucracy to take up welfare programmes, be it revival of defunct sugar mills or cold storages which could help farmers to a great extent.He pointed out that of the five sugar mills in the state, only two are in operation. The remaining three sugar mills have been closed due to several factors and his efforts to revive these units have faced hurdles from the bureaucracy, he said.The minister, however, assured the House that he would again try to make such defunct sugar mills operational. He agreed to a suggestion from the leader of the opposition Narasingh Mishra to convene a high level meeting in which Mishra will also be invited to discuss the issue and find out ways to revive defunct sugar mills.Mishra alleged that the state government failed to help the sugarcane farmers across the state. He said the farmers do not get their dues from the sugar mills run by the cooperative societies.He demanded steps be taken to revive the Vijayananda Cooperative Sugar Mills at Sagarpally in Bolangir district. He alleged the cooperative sugar mill at Bargarh has also become almost defunct because of the indifferent attitude of the government.Congress chief whip Taraprasad Bahinipati and Nabakishore Das also criticised the government for not having any policy for sugarcane growers of the state."

Assuming it to be a case of appendicitis his employers had him admitted to a hospital in his hometown. As the severity of the pain increased over the next day where the patient had to be strapped to his bed, the family decided to move him to a hospital in Udupi. Post several diagnostic tests it was revealed that Venkatesh suffered from a condition called Intestinal Ischemia.Intestinal IschemiaAcute Mesenteric Ischemia is a type of Intestinal Ischemia which usually affects the small intestine. It has an abrupt onset. In certain cases, when the individual is genetically predisposed to forming clots, this condition can be observed. It occurs due to lack of supply of oxygen-rich blood to the intestine and as a result, the cells of the intestine die. The small intestine is about six meters long in an adult. This is where 90 per cent of the digestion and absorption of food takes place.By the time the condition Naiks condition was diagnosed, most of the tissues of his intestines had died and begun to decay. The only option was to surgically remove the decaying intestinal tissue. The operation was successfully completed and after a short stay in the hospital, the doctors referred the patient to Apollo Hospital in Bengaluru for intestinal transplant.WATCH VIDEO:Surviving without an intestineVenkatesh was put on Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) after the surgery in which his intestine was removed. TPN is a way of supplying all the nutritional needs of the body by bypassing the digestive system and injecting nutrient solution directly into a vein. But this procedure cannot be permanent due to its various shortcomings. TPN can cause venous thrombosis, infection, lack of independent mobility, and the fact that it costs Rs 4000 to Rs 5000 per day makes TPN a temporary option until a transplant.The donor for intestinal transplant is a cadaver and choosing the right organ is imperative for the success of the procedure. Since the patient was on TPN for a duration of nine months it had significantly shrunk his abdominal cavity, so choosing the right organ, procuring it at the correct time and maintaining the stability of the patient is important. There were times when we had to postpone the operation as the condition of the patient was not stable due to elevated sugar levels, fluctuating blood pressure and even infections due to the TPN, said Dr Mahesh Gopasetty, consultant transplant surgeon, Apollo Hospitals, Bengaluru.No stoma createdIn March this year, the procedure was finally conducted without creating a stoma. A stoma is a loop of the intestine or a bag which is connected for excretion. By not creating a stoma the patient can continue his bowel movement in a normal manner without any discomfort of having to carry the bag with him always.Father-son duo, a happy lotWhat happened to my father was unexpected, we were confused at the beginning and even post the removal of the intestine we were not sure of how his life would be. We are thankful. The doctors instilled courage in my father that he will lead a normal life again. I cannot express my joy in words now that I see him on his feet again, said Vinay, son of Venkatesh, a class XII student. The surgery has been crowdfunded by pharma companies and donors. The typical cost of such a transplant is around Rs 20 lakh.Post the transplant, Venkatesh has started consuming food and can perform his chores independently. I am grateful to Dr Mahesh. The doctor and the hospital understood our financial constraints and helped us procure funds from NGOs. I would like to thank the team for their relentless service and for giving me a hope to live again, said Venkatesh."

Barring a half hour break to have a wash every morning, he has spent three nights sleeping in the open.Support has been considerable. Apart from WhatsApp messages and 30 to 40 calls a day to cheer me up, I have been given mosquito coils by good Samaritans to ensure I get good sleep at night. Neighbours are taking turns to come over at nights to give me company, he says.Amid the stream of visitors to the spot where he is rooted, Muralidharan, an ardent cricket enthusiast, was somehow trying to keep up with the cricket score on the fourth day of the India-Australia Test match on his phone.LonG-pending water dues to Kalahalli 2nd Phase BDA Flats Association have started trickling in, all thanks to the indefinite fast by an ad-hoc committee member R Muralidharan. Express had highlighted this crusaders fight to get the pending water bills cleared.On Sunday, the fasting senior citizen looked far from tired. He was spotted enlivening the mood for the small crowd around him with his sense of humour. He took some time off to speak to S Lalitha about his mission to recover the dues.It has been three days now since you began your fast to recover long-pending dues. Has this unusual move paid off?Of course. Five families have come forward and paid long-pending amount. A few others are coming over and asking me if they can settle their water bill in instalments. I have said no. I am not going to leave this spot in front of the pump house until every rupee of the pending `2.69 lakh is cleared. If I give up now, it would be a victory for those who have failed in their responsibilities.What is the reaction of the defaulters when they spot you?They pretend I do not exist. No one who has defaulted on payment has confronted me directly. But they have been contacting my wife and friends to convince me to call off the fast.Can this solve the problem of defaulters permanently?Absolutely. I have highlighted the issue to the BWSSB asking them to install separate meters for each house, like BESCOM does to collect its bills.How helpful is the BWSSB? Can they do something to recover the dues right now?The Water Board is legally empowered to bring them to book. There are 16 Blocks here with a common tank above each Block with separate pipelines providing water to each household. If the officials close the valve and seal it, then the families will automatically pay up when they do not get water.What made you take such adifferent approach to redress the issue?You can call it Brain fade, if I were to borrow from Smith! On a serious note, I was a trade Union leader of AITUC at Karur taluk in Tamil Nadu. Such fasts have always been successful.I am told you are also diabetic.My health has actually improved due to the fast. My sugar level, which was quite high before the fast, has actually come down now. My BP is also fine. Consumption of buttermilk every three hours and water every hour has proved to be good for my health."

Well, a few techies in the city have the answer -- getting downright dirty to relieve stress. These Bengalureans have ventured into workplace farming.Nidhi Singh, 28, used to look forward to coffee breaks at work, have a shot of her daily dose of caffeine, but now, it is all about the greens. I have stopped those coffee breaks now and spend time with my plants instead, says the Nokia employee.Freshers on the FarmNidhi grows her favourite vegetables fenugreek and baby corn at a farming plot near her office. Since she has no experience in agriculture, she relies on the Internet to research on what to grow and how. It has been a great experience so far, says the techie who holds a Masters in Computer Application.I had never grown vegetables before. I didnt think I would be able to grow as many vegetables as I have in this small plot, she says. She has reaped her first harvest and says it feels awesome. I harvested spinach and baby corn recently, but I still see it growing well with each passing day as I walk by to work, adds Nidhi.For the Love of Palak PaneerNaveen Kumar Ts love for palak paneer might be one of his inspirations behind growing spinach near his workspace. The IBM employee, who has no prior farming experiences, is also growing ladies finger along with spinach.For Naveen, it is all about building a green consciousness. As pollution takes a toll and with trees being chopped down to make way for concrete structures, he is more than willing to help the environment however he can. I am happy that I have contributed in some way, he says.Savithri Radhakrishnan, a software professional at IBM, believes farming to be a great stress buster. It is not just about work stress, but in general theres a lot going on in everyones life and theres no denying that seeing something grow productively that you have sown makes you feel content and theres a joy in that, she says.Dirt to DestressManikanta G, an employee at Kinapse Ltd, agrees.

Yes, a 100 per cent, says Manikanta.Nidhi, who made methi paratha and aloo curry out of her harvest and shared it with colleagues, also credits organic farming at work for relieving her stress. The activity has impacted positively on her emotional health too, she says.Change in PerspectiveMy perspective towards food has changed ever since I started this. I now respect the process of growing food and comprehend the struggle that farmers go through, she adds. Through lessons from her workplace farming, Nidhi now grows saplings in her apartment.Naveen, who has completed his first harvest cycle and is awaiting the next, calls the practice an excellent stress buster. My stress levels have plummeted since I started, he says.Spread across three blocks at Manyata Embassy Business Park, this agricultural land has become a stress buster for employees working in the tech park. The Urban Green initiative was introduced to techies to relieve them of work stress and help them learn about agricultural practices. The primary idea behind this initiative is to provide a low-cost way to give our office parks users the opportunity to go back to the land and incentivise the growing of safe food, says Pradeep Lala, CEO, Embassy Services.So far the employees have harvested spinach, chakotha, coriander, amaranthus, fenugreek, baby corn, brinjal, green chilli, ladies finger and tomato.

We grow rice, sugarcane and vegetables, he says.While his breaks for farming arent as frequent as coffee breaks, Shashi does make it a point to have a brief stint at the farm twice a month.Vasanth Kaje, 35, a former senior project manager at Infosys, has now turned a big plot of land back home into farm. He calls it Kaje Vrukshalaya. He took up farming while still working for another IT firm, but quit the job when the balance tilted more towards farming.All tech jobs are aimed at selling better conveniences to humans at the cost of Natures and employees own health. But this comes in various disguises and some are hard to make out. I realised it over a period of time and opted for a return journey to the farmland where I grew up, he says.While Vasanth acknowledges that farming helps him relax he says that it is the duty of every human to grow his or her food. A large section of society leaching a few farmers will eventually lead to the collapse of the system, he adds."

Mehrotra had not fixed responsibility for the loss to the exchequer on anyone.The ombudsman had also recommended that the view of the government be presented before the Supreme Court where the matter was pending."

The father-son duo of H D Deve Gowda and H D Kumaraswamy have been attacking both the parties over their inaction on Cauvery, making the most of the two parties spending time on winning seats that do not matter.JD(S), which decided not to field candidates, has taken the lead in criticising the government and the principal opposition party over their inaction in countering the traction being gained by some farmers from Tamil Nadu who are protesting in Delhi.The farmers have entered their 22nd day of protest at Jantar Mantar seeking loan waivers and a special drought package.Their novel protest methods of displaying skulls of farmers who have committed suicide, holding snakes and rats in their mouths to signify they have nothing else to eat and tonsuring half their heads and moustache, are rapidly gaining attention in the national media.Most of the Tamil Nadu farmers who have committed suicide are from the Cauvery belt that is as dry on their their side as it is on Karnatakas side.JD(S) has been quick to scream foul saying that Congress and BJP leaders leaders have not bothered to raise the Cauvery issue in Parliament and reflect the true situation in the state.The Tamil Nadu MPs are supporting the farmers and collectively raising their voices on Cauvery. While BJPs Ananth Kumar, who is close to Prime Minister Modi, does not say anything. Rahul Gandhi is supporting Tamil Nadu farmers, but these two parties here are only worried about the bypolls, Gowda said.There is pressure because of the TN farmers protest to fast track the formation of the Water Management Board. But all the 17 MPs of BJP from the state are sitting here breaking their heads about the bypolls for the sake of their prestige.What is the Chief Minister doing? This is why our state is constantly losing out on this issue, lambasted Kumaraswamy.Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar said, Both the national parties have deceived us. It is sad to see them fight for prestige, when it is totally unnecessary. Our special representative in Delhi and our representatives should be talking about the grave situation here. But they are busy with so much drama.Little room to manoeuvreBut Congress is having none of it. We are taking the elections seriously. As far as Cauvery is concerned, we do not have much room for manoeuvring and we are firm in our position that we cannot release any water.Tamil Nadu has always been on the forefront on this issue. What can we do about it? said KPCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao."

Most of the vendors and shopkeepers blame it on the Centres demonetisation (de-mon) move since the street caters mainly to those who opt for cash payments.Last year, sales at the Broadway market averaged `5 crore per month. However, this year the market has seen a 40 per cent decline in sales, says P A Sajeer, president of the Broadway Shop Owners Association. Even the Vishu and Easter week has failed to push up the sales which have remained dismal, he says.Shamsudeen,63, who has been running a banana stall here for the last 30 years, says, In all my years here, the business has never been so dull. I blame the price hike on the truckers stir last month.The truckers strike pushed up the prices of these products to almost double their original price. The ones hit most by the drop in the sales are the small-scale vendors who run their own vegetable and fruit carts.A hike in the prices of the commodities and the cash-shortage caused by demonetisation all reduce the purchasing power of the working class, who are the main customers of these vendors. Some retailers,though, remain hopeful their sales will pick up in the coming days on Vishu and Easter eve or in the days to follow.There is usually an increase in sales in the days after Vishu and Easter which is when most people come to spend the festival bonus, says Mohammed Aftab,30, who runs an appliance store on Broadway.The seasons leit motifs-- set-saris,Kanikonna and idols of Lord Krishna-- which usually fly off the shelves during this time of the year, now sit on the racks gathering dust.Even after we started canvassing and giving out coupons to the customers,the sales have only picked up marginally, says Neetha Shenoy proprietor of Adithi, a textiles outlet. Not even the essential ingredients of the traditional Vishu sadya like rice, jaggery and sugar have seen a noticeable rise in sales.The flower merchants too have been badly hit as a result of the plummeting business, which has seen their numbers dwindle to a mere two.We are managing somehow but the other shop owners had to close down their stalls because they had no business and they were incurring losses, says Shaji, 38, a staffer.The shopkeepers and the wayside vendors are unanimous in their view demonetisation is to blame for the staggering shortfall witnessed in business.Since majority of the regular customers do not have access to credit or debit cards and net banking,the trend of digital transactions has left them woefully short of cash. This effects not only the purchasing power of the working class but also the income of these vendors.The de-mon fallout will take at least one-and- a-half years to set itself right,according to the traders.Until then the best we can do is to hold on and hope the fall in sales is only temporary, says Abbas Pulokkatil."

There is shortage of essentials like sugar, jaggery and pulses.He added, Transactions have been impacted heavily, especially in Yeshwantpur market. Although the protest has extended to other states in the south, there have been no issues in Chennai and Puducherry.Mysuru and Bengaluru are bearing the brunt.Secretary of Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders Ranjith Hegde said, Petrol pumps across the state are open and tankers are plying. We have extended our support symbolically and we totally disagree with the taxes and hike in insurance premium.However, we have innumerable formalities like writing letters to oil companies to be carried out before we join the protest physically. The decision to formally join them will be taken after discussion, he said.Voicing similar opinion, Bhushan Narang, president of Bangalore Petroleum Dealers Association, said, There is no impact on petrol or diesel.

I grew up with my mother used to making amazing lachha parathas, smeared with home-made butter. The flavour of fenugreek and dry methi leaves always used to make me smile. She was my first mentor and sole inspiration to get into cooking. From the classic rajma chawal with homemade curd to the simple spice-flavoured raitha, I learnt it all from her. My first every dish was methi chicken and stuffed gobi paratha  one of my favourites!I was born in Dehradun, but spent my whole life in Lucknow  the flavours, currys, biriyani, kebabs, kormas, parathas  being a foodie, it was a great place to live. Following my mothers instructions and watching several TV shows, I began to think about the fast-food culture in the country  most places offer western fast food. I wanted to give delicious and healthy Indian fast-food and started a take-away joint in Lucknow  spinach, ragii rolls with fish, chicken and soya were very famous.I love experimenting with food and thats what keeps me going  golgappas served the molecular way, ulta tawa paratha and galouti kabab, frozen chicken tikka salad are what I love to cook in Modern Indian cuisine.Though I know several cuisines including Japanese and continental, my roots remain in Awadhi cuisine. From cooking Gosht meat with garlic (whole pulp) and onion and transforming it into a flavoursome curry to barsi meat (meat prepared and stored for a day, a Pakistani concept), I enjoy doing it all. Ingredients like javitri, dry rose petals, cardamom and cinnamon are my best friends. Their aromas give new dimension to food and can be used in both sweets and savoury items. Its magic!Speaking of sweets Sohan halwa, a toffee-like sweet made of wheat, water and sugar is famous in Lucknow and Delhi. Its my number one favorite, followed by rasagulla, kala jamun and lucknowi kulfi falooda.I enjoy cooking for my family. My ultimate dream is to visit Japan and learn about their authentic dishes. I already love cooking the sashimi and sushi and I want to learn more! Its a never-ending process.Jayanandhan Baskar will be heading the Awadhi Food Festival in Park Hyatt, Chennai until April 16"

Then he stirs the mixture, heats it up, adds leaves of mint, and then offers it to the people present. The resulting taste is simple and delicious.Risotto is an Italian dish, but they dont make it sweet, says Ranveer. It is more a savoury, like mushroom risotto. But I decided to make something new.Ranveer had been specially invited by Mercedes Benz for their customer engagement initiative called Luxe Drive.But this is not the first time that Ranveer has come to Kerala. Eleven years ago, he had come for a friends wedding and became enamoured of Kerala cuisine. I loved the avial I ate at the function, he says.Thereafter, he started studying Mappila food, Syrian Christian recipes and the menu of the Nampoothiri Brahmins. The fascinating part about Kerala cuisine is the way it changes across regions, he says.And he lists his favourites. The biriyani that the Mappilas make is awesome, says Ranveer. It is not refined and sophisticated. Instead, it is rustic but tasty. Similarly, the practice of sadhya was started by the Nampoothiris as a way to feed the Brahmins. I also enjoy the Syrian Christian fish curry but this is something I would like to have the next day, because it tastes good only after a day of fermentation.Asked to compare Kerala cuisine with other parts of India, Ranveer says, It cannot be compared, because for 2000 years there have been so many influences: the Romans, Arabs, Dutch, Portuguese, and British. It is a unique cuisine.And thanks to his Global Menu television show, on the Foodz channel, Ranveer is always coming across unique cuisines. The show goes off the beaten track and has focused on places like North and South Korea, Sri Lanka, Romania and Mongolia, he says.The Mongolians have a dish called Khorkhog. Chicken or lamb is cooked with vegetables and stones in a closed container. When you eat it, you can detect a slight earthiness from the stones, which makes it very tasty, says Ranveer.Apart from his TV show, Ranveer runs restaurants in the USA, Canada and India. Last year, he brought out a cookbook called Come into my kitchen. His Mumbai-based premium patisserie, English Vinglish serves fusion desserts, breads and bakes.Ranveer has done a mini-video series on Twitter titled Ranveer On The Road, which featured his culinary sojourn through Australia, apart from being a judge on Season 4 of Masterchef India.And this passion for food began in the unlikeliest of places. When he was a child, growing up in Lucknow, his grandfather Jagir Singh would take him to the gurudwara. A restless Ranveer would run around and end up at the langar. That was when I saw cooking for the first time, he says. Soon, Ranveer began helping around.At age 16, he did the unthinkable for a son of an aeronautical engineer. He ran away from home and worked at a roadside kebab shop run by a man called Munir Ahmed for eight months. However, later, he graduated from the Indian Institute of Hotel Management at Lucknow.Asked the secret to a good dish, Ranveer says, Our five fingers have five rasas: sweet, sour, salty, savoury and spicy. So, when we cook with the hand, the rasas go into the food. And when we eat with our hand, the rasas go inside us. It is important to cook honestly and sincerely because food transfers emotions. So, you are always giving a part of yourself in every dish."

58fd22237be9e06c937158c8,Being a vegetarian in Dubai,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/apr/05/being-a-vegetarian-in-dubai-1590329.html,2017-04-06,"HYDERABAD: At every occasion, my friends grab the chance to ask me, Tereko paneer hi chicken hai na! When I told them that I was visiting the worlds most happening and luxurious city  Dubai, I found them rolling on the floor, laughing and asking me how I would survive in Dubai. I just facepalmed them and walked away. I left for Dubai half-heartedly because even I was not sure I would survive being a vegetarian in Dubai. But then...Global approach:As I settled down with my seatbelt and my book on the Emirates EK 527, I was filled with excitement on my first trip to Dubai. I checked into Rove City Centre hotel and realised there was a supermarket on the ground floor. I felt relieved,thinking I would survive on chips and sodas, if not on paneer and baigan. The view of the skyscrapers from the hotel room ensured the Dubai feeling soaked in. We headed off to Global Village. Well, before we get into food, let me brief about the worlds only place where we find America and Russia under one roof. Wondering how? Global Village has pavilions of all the countries representing their culture, food and shopping activities. Guess what! Indian pavilion represented our country in the real sense of the term. While the other countries co-existed in silence, Indian pavilion had Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Kajarare playing in high decibels.The special tea at the African pavilion awakened all my senses and I was all set for the surprises Dubai was throwing at me. After some adventure with roller coasters, I went to Thailand arena just to relish those fresh-cut exotic fruits like dragon fruit, wild pineapple and peaches. Well, they are available at every supermarket in our city, but the Thai fruits were bigger and juicier. They were organic and tastier. While walking through the sprawling Fun Park, I stumbled upon Turkish ice cream stall and the magic that they weaved with it won me over. Nutella donuts to nutella icecreams and tarts, the hazelnut and chocolate lovers can go crazy. We stopped by the Grand Barbeque, anIndian restaurant to have our dinner along with our new Syrian friend, an employee of Global Village. The joy of making him taste the spicy panipuri and Afghani paneer with masala kulcha was thrilling beyond words. Just like in the movie Queen, he got teary-eyed when he first tasted the spicy pudina and imli pani, but later he couldnt resist from eating more. Well, I felt good turning into the panipuri wala bhaiya temporarily. The dinner was complete at the Chinese pavilion with some steaming hot jasmine tea.Ripe Market:After a scrumptious breakfast at the hotel, we went to Zabeel Park and were introduced to a concept called Ripe Market. Here farmers and food creators from the world over gather and exhibit what they offer to the world. Well, I got to taste caramel and lotus-flavoured iced-tea and cow milk icecream, various hybrid varieties of olives, white honey, queens honey, mountain honey, Mexican pina colada, organically grown fresh fruits, vegetables and more than 90 varieties of cooking oils. In addition of all these raw food, we got to indulge in some doughnuts, cupcakes and brownies.Beach Canteen:We Indians are used to eating at the beach. Arent we? Bhajjis, peanuts, corn and what not but the experience of having organised stalls of gourmet brands from across the globe. Well, what else can a man ask for! Clean beach, plethora of food and of course some music and dance. The live cooking sessions too were attractive, but surely not for the vegetarians. Beach Canteen at the Kite Beach had everything one could die for. Waffles with fresh cream and fruits to Japanese veg sushi to Lebanese style of cheese samosa,the authentic Emirati sweet delicacy- Luqaimat. It is fried dumplings with some date syrup or caramel syrup on it. I bet, one cant stop with one. It is as addictive as Lays or Kurkure. Some cold pressed organic drinks containing vegetables, fruits and herbs with names like Better than Botox replaced the regular aerated drinks. I tried all their flavours. Haagen-Dazs ice cream completed the beach experience.Street Night:The pop culture in Dubai is just beyond imagination. After having the taste of global platter at the Beach Canteen, the evening began with some street style food trail. Battle of BBoys welcomed us to the Street Nights where people thronged to get some chilled out vibes and sample the hottest street food vendors. Regions top graffiti artists too jammed in a live graffiti, adding to those vibes. Guess what was the best part of Street Night, Kaapi.. Kaapi Filter Kaapi! We Indians always manage to mark our presence and stand out. Well, coming to food, a young South Indian boy owns a food truck called Wokinakki, where he serves you the recipe of happiness. The fusion of Thai and Indian veg rice bowl made the non-vegetarians turn green in envy. Yes! The falvours of Thai curry with exotic vegetables and a pinch of Indian masala made the dish stand out among all the other rolls and sandwiches. Moving to the Egyptian stall, I was wondering, if I would get something non-meaty and to my surprise, a dish called Kushdari, made of rice, noodles and crispy macaroni with the right amount of spices gave me an insight into the fact that there are vegetarians in every country and it is not always about meat. Just to add fun to my goal-worthy food trails, I tried some lemon-mango popsicles. Oh wait, the Poland stall offered me some charcoal lemonade and Dutch offered me some cheese sandwich. Perhaps it is a global tradition to end the meal with a dessert and at Street Night, it was at Cryspes. It was fritters with preferred flavour topping. The toppings varied from caramel, nutella to the famous Lotus biscuits of Dubai.Comptoir 102The third day at Dubai started off on a healthy note. Comptoir 102 on Jumeriah road offered us more than just healthy food. Winner of the Whats On Award of the best Healthy cafe in Dubai, Comptoir 102 is one among the favourite places for healthy eating. The philosophy behind the caf is to offer a more conscious and healthy lifestyle by bringing more sustainable and nutritious food. The cafe had French ambience and arty stuff around were a delight to eyes. The cafe sources ingredients from local organic farms, sugar-free and dairy-free, with raw, vegan and gluten free options menu, changes daily according to harvest, just like at home. The smoothies and juices are vitamin-packed. We were served Skinny Boast- a smoothie made of cucumber, banana and basil, Heaven on earth- a smoothie made of cinnamon, cocoa and banana. Acaio, almond butter porridge, chocolate porridge and pancakes surprise my tummy that was full of junk.City Walk:From a simple milk chocolate to exotic dark chocolate, the mall had chocolates from all parts of the world. If this is not called heaven, then what is! Just when I was relishing those chocolates, I was introduced to a new snack called French fries. Puzzled? Well, these were sweet potato french fries. This just goes to prove that no matter how ugly potato looks, the output of it is delicious and addictive.Kak:At the Lebanese canteen, we tasted Kak. It is a bread with sesame seeds and a filling of our choice. For the sweet tooth, it was nutella Kak and for the chessy people, it was the herb and cheese. This authentic Lebanese dish has a history of being the most favourite street food of the middle eastern countries.We had dinner at Rang Mahal at JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai on the last night of our trip and it was exotic. Chef Atul Kochhars team ensured we were served unique dishes. The yam starter was simple, but most memorable.

This is the question that villagers of Neduvasal faces as buzz over hydrocarbon project grows stronger with each passing day. A yes to oil would bring in growth of a different kind. But it would also mean uncertainty.Farmers here are certain about the strength of their soil and its ability to sustain them. But they are still not certain how oil extraction will not affect their agricultural fields.The primary responsibility of a farmer is not just to post bumper yield, but to preserve and nourish fertility of the land that gives him everything. The residents of Neduvasal and adjoining villages have managed to achieve this over the years.Farmers stacking the harvested sugarcane inlorries near Nallandarkollai village inPudukkottai district | M K Ashok KumarGreen is the colourSituated in Pudukkottai, Neduvasal lies close to Pattukkottai and Peravoorani in Thanjavur district. Spread over 668 hectares, 70 per cent of land in the village is earmarked for agriculture. The only difference between Neduvasal and other villages falling under Alangudi taluk is its lush greenery.T Kandavel, a farmer in Neduvasal, proudly says, Ithu Muppogam Vilayura Boomi (This is land that cultivates three terms a year). Be it Samba (long term), Kuruvai (short term), or Thalady (intermediate), one can see lands with crops, he says.With no river or major tributary passing through the region, Neduvasal and adjoining Vadakadu and Nallandarkollai depend on rain and groundwater. Almost every household has invested on a borewell.Speaking to Express, a senior Agriculture Department official said, Even if monsoon fails, people in Neduvasal and villages adjoining Alangudi can be seen cultivating the whole year.A comparative analysis would tell one about the soil here. Take the case of Thiruvalarcholai near Kollidam in Tiruchy. Despite its proximity to the Cauvery, there are vast tracts of barren land. But not in Neduvasal.Neduvasal fares marginally well than the rest of Pudukkottai in terms of yield.The average paddy yield for the district is 2,153 kg per acre, according to Agriculture Department sources. But the farmers in Neduvasal posted an average yield of 2,170 kg per acre this Samba season, despite drought-like situation.Not lured by offersFarmers who sold or leased their lands to ONGC allege that they were lured into doing so, with the assurance that they were being acquired only for kerosene exploration.But C Subramanian is an exception. In fact, he is the hero of his fellow farmers, having stood up against the ONGC. For those protesting now, the gravity of the situation dawned upon them only after February 15, when the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs awarded as many as 31 Discovered Small Field contracts for hydrocarbon exploration.The officials from the ONGC came to survey my field in 2013. When I enquired, they replied that kerosene reserve has been found in four acres of my land. Since then, the ONGC has been requesting me to hand over my land. But I refused to budge, says the 67-year-old farmer.There are farmers who got paddy yield of 2,300 to 2,600 kg per acre, despite monsoon failure. We dont have canal based irrigation system. We are not against governments or projects, we just dont want a risky project bang in the midst of a fertile patch, says Subramanian. And that is the crux of the protest."

The money was sent by Zezvda, a Bulgarian company, said ED officials.Georges company, Trade International, had been operating with a valid licence. Within a few days of the transfer, George withdrew `30 crore from the account and deposited it in the accounts of his relatives. A Customs Department scrutiny of documents submitted by George to show details of goods shipped to Zevzda, found that no commodity was exported against the LoC. Since the money was withdrawn using the LoC before exporting goods, the Department referred the case to the ED.Georges claims that he was sourcing sugar and sunflower oil for export from manufacturers based in Chennai and Maharashtra were found to be false by the ED.

Two out of every five women with diabetes are of reproductive age, accounting for over 60 million women worldwide. These women are facing an unprecedented challenge, as diabetes not only affects them but also their progeny.With advancements in medical science, it is becoming increasingly possible for women (with medical complications) to become mothers and women with diabetes is no exception.However uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal and maternal complications such as early labor, birth defects and very large babies. The risk of these complications is directly proportional to the high blood sugar levels in the mother.In developing countries including India, the risks are compounded by the to lack of awareness, resources and proper action. By doing pre-conception counseling and with optimal control of diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy, we can minimise maternal and fetal risks including birth defects.Most experts recommend that all pregnant women be screened for gestational diabetes between the 24 and 28 weeks. Especially women at risk (who are overweight, over 35 years, have a family history of diabetes, had a previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or had given birth to large baby) must undergo a full checkup for diabetes in every trimester, and an oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) is usually recommended.If you already have diabetes and are planning to have a baby, it is desirable to achieve and maintain blood sugar levels for at least three months before conceiving. This is essential as the babys organs start developing in the first six to 10 weeks of the pregnancy.The four fundamentals to manage diabetes during pregnancy are diet, physical activity, insulin and monitoring. A nutritionist can help plan a diet that can fulfill all requirements in the pregnancy without leading to excessive weight gain based on the body weight and other details. The key objective of dietary modifications is to avoid peaks in blood sugar levels and provide proper nutrition.Physical activity is beneficial. If you arent exercising regularly, now is a good time to start, but check with your doctor about your planned activity and start slowly. Youll need to plan your periods of activity along with your food intake and insulin injections.Your insulin dose need to be adjusted periodically; as the hormones that accompany pregnancy interfere with the action of insulin, but in consultation with your treating physician only.After delivery, if you had gestational diabetes, you should test for diabetes 6-12 weeks after you give birth and yearly after that. If you had diabetes before pregnancy, you will be able to go back to your pre-pregnancy insulin dosage very soon after delivery. Breastfeeding is good for the babies, as well as the women with diabetes.Breastfeeding can also lower the amount of insulin you need. Oral anti diabetic drugs are not recommended during breastfeeding. The normal advice for pregnancy also applies to women with diabetes- eat a healthy, balanced diet, avoid smoking, and alcohol.Women with diabetes who have good control can carry their baby to full term without any challenges. So, stay calm and be positive!(The writer is a diabetologist from Chennai)"

We are the kind of family that would stop even when we were driving, just to admire the trees! All through my life, I have had to have some kind of natural green around me all the time, says the co- founder of The Magic Bean, an organisation promoting environmental sustainability through urban organic gardens.pics by Romani AgawrwalAn urban planner by training with a focus on housing, she also delved into urban food security, but her foray into urban organic gardening in her own house started when she once asked her young son where strawberries came from. He and several of his friends replied - from the supermarket! That completely freaked me out! she exclaims. That made her decide to grow vegetables in her house as a personal choice. I wanted my son to know where his food comes from.This was also partly because she felt that children form a certain socio-economic background and above were disconnected from the earth.  In fact, we tell children not to play in the soil! That was the impetus for me to do this on a certain scale in my house and introduce my friends to it too! And once youve tasted something you ve grown, nothing ever tastes the same,she adds.Today in her own garden both in her courtyard and on the terrace, she experiments with the same using waste produce such as coconut shells and sugarcane waste. It so happens that my professional life and personal life became intertwined!In her courtyard she has a mix of ornamental as well as fruit-bearing plants including banana, papaya, nochi (which is a mosquito repellant).Because I have so many trees, I even have varieties of birds coming - including a sun bird couple - and lots of butterflies! In her first floor balcony are quaint additions like saunf, lemon grass, chicken spinach, basil and such. But her real harvest is on the terrace where she had cultivated her own rooftop farm. She proudly plucks a few pink radishes and displays them.. Salad leaves, pasala keerai, chillies, red ladies fingers, tomatoes of several varieties, carrots....at my sons school(where she has introduced the programme) the tomatoes are as big as a pomegranate! she exclaims. She also does a lot of seed- saving to obtain seeds from plants.If I am told something will not grow in Chennai , I absolutely have to try it. But most importantly I want everyone in my family and others to know how easy it is to do it. For example, I now make my own Bokashi bran (used in composting) on my own, she laughs. ""Kids especially, when they are taught to value the hard work behind growing their own greens, will automatically take care of the plants themselves."""

Proper waste management. Easy availability of organic vegetables... Long is the wishlist of every resident in the city. Can they hope to get their wishes fulfilled? Yes, say the residents of Link Valley at Kakkanad.This gated community of 80 families, adjacent to Infopark, has become the first in the country to obtain a Green Protocol - 5 star certificate, for waste management and plastic recycling, from the State-run Suchitwa Mission.Pic Albin MathewThe protocols were implemented under the guidance of the Mission, as well as the NGO, Pelican Foundation.We began our waste management system in 2009. Right from the start we implemented a waste segregation system right at home, says Sudheer Das, president of the Link Valley residents association. It is a well-known fact that the success of every initiative depends on the whole-hearted participation of everybody, says Sudheer. We were lucky in that. The waste management initiative was backed by all, he adds.The residents separated the household refuse into biodegradable, plastic and e-waste. The separated waste is collected by the Kudumbasree unit members. The biodegradable waste is converted into compost and used to fertilise the plants, says Sudheer.As for the plastic and e-waste it is handed over to outside agencies for recycling and reuse. We dont have the technology needed to deal with the plastic waste, so the only option is to send it outside, says Binod Hariharan, association secretary.But there was a suggestion among community members to remove the problem right at the source. For example, every household buys at least a litre of milk everyday, says Sudheer. If they buy four quarter-litre packets then they end up with four plastic packets. Thus, by the end of the week it is 28.So, you can imagine how much of plastic is generated by the end of the month?It was at this juncture that the community came up with the idea of a green store. This was later set up with the help of Pelican Foundation. At the store, plastic bags and packaging have been done away with. Instead, paper bags are used for items like rice, pulses, condiments, sugar and flour.These bags have been provided by the Pelican Foundation, to carry their purchases back home. But for subsequent purchases they have to reuse the bags, says Sudheer. Soon, the store will begin selling milk in glass bottles."

As many as 32 temple elephants, including two from Puducherry, are participating, while another two are expected to reach the camp in the next few days.Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Commissioner M Veera Shanmuga Moni inaugurated the camp by feeding banana and pineapple to a pachyderm at 8.30 am. The centre of attraction at the camp is Masini, a female elephant who happens to be the youngest participant. Masini was abandoned by her mother in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in 2007. The Forest Department rescued and maintained her in Theppakkadu elephant camp at MTR in Udhagamandalam district. After a four-month training in November 2015 at Chadivayal elephant camp in Coimbatore, she was handed over to Samayapuram Mariyamman Temple in Tiruchy last year.This is the ninth year of the camp, conducted to improve mental health and physical behaviour of all temple elephants. For those elephants that are unable to attend the camp here, instructions have been given to provide special food at their respective places and their health monitored by a local veterinarian. Special classes would be conducted to mahouts and Kavadis on giving the best care to the pachyderms, said Moni.A balanced diet with flattened rice, turmeric, salt, dates, jaggery, rice, horse gram, green gram and a variety of green fodder along with fruits and sugarcane will be provided to the elephants.Four teams have been formed to check the animals health on a shift basis over the next one month. Fresh dung samples will be collected on Friday morning to detect diseases in animals, said T Tamilselvan, Regional Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry. Sivakami, owned by Sri Thiruthalinathar Swamy Temple, Thiruppathur in Sivaganga district, was treated for a wound on its leg.Lakshmi from Manakula Vinayagar Temple in Puducherry reached on Thursday evening, while Prakruthi from Dharbaranyeswarar Temple at Thirunallar came to the camp in the night. Ramalakshmi, owned by Arulmigu Ramanthaswamy Thirukoil, and Kothai from Adikesavan Perumal Thirukoil, Sriperumbudur, were unable to attend the camp due to temple festivals.

Instead of bottling, Coca-Cola is focusing on marketing its brands and selling syrups and concentrates to the bottlers.

He said Thursday that the company will expand the Smartwater brand in Western Europe and offer more soda in smaller cans and bottles.For the current year, the company expects earnings to fall 1 percent to 4 percent from 2016's earnings of $1.91 per share. Analysts had expected 2017 earnings to rise 2 percent to $1.95 per share, according to FactSet.Coca-Cola earned $550 million, or 13 cents per share, for the three months ending Dec. 31.

That's a penny better than what analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research anticipated.Total revenue dropped to $9.41 billion from $10 billion, dragged down partly by a strong dollar, acquisitions and divestitures. Still, this managed to beat the $9.1 billion in revenue that analysts surveyed by Zacks were calling for.Global sales volume dipped 1 percent, with a 4 percent drop in Latin America and 1 percent increases in both North America and Europe.

The polarised Jat voters of 2014 had partly helped the BJP win the massive mandate in the Lok Sabha elections, paving the way for Narendra Modi's national ascendancy.If the BJP manages to hold on to the seats of the Jat belt of western UP, there's a fair chance that it would be within a striking distance of power in Lucknow when votes are counted on March 11.But, if Ajit Singh's RLD bounces back on its slogan that the BJP has not kept its promise of giving reservation to the Jat community, then it could be a rather uphill task for the BJP.Ground-level reports suggest that the Centre's demonetisation move, in addition to the unsatisfactory minimum support price for sugarcane, has left the Jat community restive and divided, with the youth still rooting for Modi and the old generation returning to Ajit Singh.If the Jat community has a choice between the BJP and RLD, the Muslims -- the other big bloc of voters -- too have a choice, between the SP-Congress combine and the BSP.Law and order, which is an issue in this part of UP that has seen riots, has the minority voter talk about Mayawati's 'stern' administration with a tinge of nostalgia.Last Assembly elections, SP and BSP were equally placed with 24 seats each. But this time, the Muslim voters in West UP seem set for a decisive vote to either one of them, the SP-Congress or the BSP.The Congress does have a few pockets of influence in this region and to be fair, there's no strong anti-incumbency against its ally, Akhilesh Yadav.But Mayawati who has chosen her candidates carefully and has a better law and order record than Akhilesh is very much in the reckoning.Whether she or Ajit Singh will be a winner or a spoiler, will only be known when the votes are counted.Then come the Dalit voters, for whom BJP chief Amit Shah and BSP chief Mayawati are battling it out.If the Dalits come back to Mayawati en masse, and she gets a sizeable chunk of Muslim votes, then there's no stopping her. If Shah manages to restrict Mayawati to her core Jatav votes, then it will be harder for the BSP to balance the act in the other coming phases.In western UP thus, it's indeed a four-cornered contest with no clear wave in any one's favour. But it's also a straight fight for vote banks."

But she was in for the shock of her life buying biscuits! The fat-free digestive biscuits she bought for her diabetic father contained 15 per cent hidden fat, which hiked his daily caloric intake to precarious levels.Wrapped in sugar-coated advertisements, grossly misleading health claims on labels of packed food products are shoved down the throats of credulous customers daily.Now, the bummer. Official data has made a startling revelation that about 20 percent (one-fifth) of all packed food items sold in Kerala are either adulterated or misbranded.According to the annual report of the Public Laboratory Testing, authorities had registered a total of 586 cases in connection with adulteration and slapped Rs 1.38 crore as a fine between 2014 and 2016. The report notes of the 4,931 samples analysed from Kerala, 923 were adulterated or misbranded. Sources said the samples of various food articles of brands across the spectrum have been found to be adulterated or misbranded.Be it coconut oil, milk, tea, rice, spices or items included in our daily diet, adulteration is taking place at an alarming level. Harmful chemicals were also found in many of these products. The best way to tackle the issue is to create awareness and further strengthen the monitoring mechanisms, said a food safety officer.While food manufacturers often use nutritional facts to make health claims on their products, the regulations do not have a list of authorised or unauthorised health claims. Most health claims are misleading as health depends on the total diet and lifestyle, not just on one product. Though rules under the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, mandate that such claims are scientifically substantiated, they are vague on the substantiation standards. Experts say the low conviction rate and lack of officers are prime reasons for such food items finding their way into the shelves."

He said the minister had publicly admitted that a part of the money recovered from his house was from his sugar factory income and that he had declared an asset worth Rs 115 crores before the IT department.Law Minister T B Jayachandra asked Speaker K B Koliwad not to allow the debate since the opposition has failed to provide any evidence to prove the charges.

The previous record was 106.65 mt in 2013-14.Wheat output is projected to be 96.64 mt this year as against 92.29 mt in 2015-16. It may be noted that last year's wheat output has been revised downwards from 93.50 mt. The previous record was 95.85 mt achieved in 2013-14 crop year.In the case of pulses, the output is projected to be all-time high at 22.14 mt this year as against actual output of 16.35 mt last year. The previous record was 19.25 mt in 2013-14.The output, however, is still short of the country's estimated demand of 23-24 million tonnes. But the likely rise in output will reduce the country's dependence on imports.Coarse cereal output is estimated to be a record 44.34 mt this year as against 38.52 mt last year. The previous record was 43.40 mt in 2013-14.The foodgrain basket comprises wheat, rice, pulses and coarse cereals.Oilseed production is also pegged at a record 33.60 mt this year with soyabean output likely to be 14.13 mt, groundnut 8.47 mt and castorseed 1.74 mt.Last year, oilseed output was 25.25 mt and the previous record was 32.75 mt in 2013-15.Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated at 32.51 million bales (of 170 kg each) this year, as against 30 million bales last year.However, sugarcane output is likely to be lower at 309.98 mt this year as against 348.44 mt last year, while jute and mesta output is estimated to be lower at 10.06 million bales (of 180 kg each) as against 10.52 million bales last year.The government releases total four estimates on foodgrains production before the final one at different stages of production and harvesting period."

It is the fastest growing disease in the country and it is a matter of serious concern as this invariably also impacts the overall economy.While diabetes is a chronic medical condition, the good news is that at the pre-diabetes stage, the disease can be curbed by introducing lifestyle and dietary changes. A healthy diet coupled with an active lifestyle plays a vital role in delaying the onset of the disease. Medical experts across the world encourage pre-diabetics to adopt low GI foods in their diet.A low GI diet leads to healthy metabolism and weight management both of which effectively helps to manage blood sugar. It is thus important to elevate our understanding of what Low GI means and the role it plays in our overall wellbeing. Glycemic Index or GI is a scale that ranks food we eat by the amount of blood sugar released in the body. Protein or fiber rich foods have low GI and are better regulators of blood sugar and hence an understanding of Glycemic Index helps us make healthier food choices.How does one understand the numbers on a glycemic index scale? The index is quite simple to understand -- foods are ranked on a scale of 0 to 100. Knowing the GI value of foods gives one enhanced control on ones diet.Examples of low GI foods are apple, banana, grapes, chana dal, urad dal, rajma, boiled peas, and carrots and sweet potato. Also wheat forms a major part of the Indian staple diet, replacing normal wheat flour with Low GI atta helps in managing diabetes. One must however bring in a balance of low and high GI foods and eat a well-balanced meal.Apart from diet, there are several other factors that affect the way the body responds to carbohydrates. Age, activity levels and the bodys metabolism play an essential role in determining how carbohydrates are processed.Also, the way a particular food is prepared can change its GI value.All the above factors, combined with diet and exercise, help in managing total LDL cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.Dr. Shivprasad C is DM in Endocrinology, Apollo Medical Centre"

While their OCI cards, announced by PM Narendra Modi is the fulfillment of much wanted wish, attempts are being made to create archives of the original indentured labourers who travelled to Mauritius, Fiji, Guyana and Suriname as early as 1834.Minister for Culture and Arts and Social Integration and Economic Empowerment of Mauritius Prithvirasing Roopun said the first batch of 38 labourers came to Mauritius from Chota Nagpur area through Calcutta by ship to reach the Aapravasi Ghat or the Immigration Depot at Port Louis in Mauritius. Mauritius was the first place of the so called experiment by the British imperialists of the free contract system and they were recruited to work in the sugar fields.

Akhileshji I can understand if you attack Modi and BJP but I am amused that you have attacked donkeys...are you afraid of donkeys, that too these are thousands of kilometres away?""

Did you know that bad teeth are an indicator of other more serious problems? Increasingly, records in dental clinics are proving a theory that dental surgeons have suspected for sometime: Oral health is closely connected to general health.According to dental surgeons, oral health is very important and critical for ones overall health. Majority of the people do not brush their teeth twice a day. Gum diseases (bacterial infection) are common these days.If not treated properly on time, gum disease is capable of affecting other body organs through the bloodstream.Most of the youth now days are completely neglecting their oral health and falling prey to mouth cancer by chewing pan masala, gutkha and smoking, doctors say.Healthy teeth help a child eat properly, speak clearly and guide adult teeth into place.Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Good oral health helps children get proper nutrition, maintain good overall health and enjoy a better quality of life. Dentists also pointed out that many in rural areas still use their fingers, brick powder or been sticks for brushing teeth. Some of these things could actually be harmful.Dr J Ravi Rakesh Dev, a dental specialist, says that ignorance is the main reason for the wide prevalence of practices that are detrimental to oral health in India.Majority of the people in India would only approach a dentist when they faced with a crisis  usually only after they turn 40.Oral care is important because the mouth is where the digestive system begins. People fail to understand the intimate connection between oral health and overall health.The mouth is the starting place for keeping bacteria out, and it should be properly maintained. People should visit dentist once in every six months for proper oral health.Chewing sugar-free gum after a meal, for instance, can help prevent oral cavities, he added.An unhealthy mouth often means an unhealthy heart, says K Mythri, dentist at Keerthi Dental Clinic.People suffering from periodontitis ( a gum disease) are at higher risk of coronary artery disease. The bacteria might enter the bloodstream while chewing or brushing and this would contribute to the formation of clots in the arteries, which can cause heart attack, Mythri added.Take diabetes and tooth decay  an established connection. The higher your blood sugar level, the higher your risk of tooth decay, says B Supritha, dentist at ABC dental clinic."

Usse isse phark nahi padta ki uski peeth par chini ladi hai ya choona (It performs its duty diligently irrespective of the fact that it is loaded with sugar or lime stone).Ridiculing the CMs comment, the Prime minister dubbed donkey as his source of inspiration. My countrymen are my masters and the donkey inspires me to work for them untiringly, unstoppingly, he said reiterating his vow to keep working for the people all his life.At his Basti rally, Modi sought to blend his references to Akhileshs donkey comment with a few lines of a poem on donkey written by a renowned local poet Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena, Neta ke do topi gadhe ke do kaan, topi adal-badal kar pehne, gadha tha pareshan; ek roz unko gadhe ne tang gali mein ghera, neta ur gaye, topi ur gayee, a ur gaye unke kaan; Beech sabha mein khada ho gaya gadha seena tan (A donkey was rattled by the ever changing topis of politicians. With the changing times, politicians come and go but the donkey remained there with pride).Further sharpening his attack, the PM alleged the CM has casteist mindset as he mocked at the poor donkey while pressing the entire state machinery into action to search for a buffalo of a minister (Azam Khan).What harm the poor donkey of Gujarat has caused you, why are your scared of it? he asked him.Modi lambasted Akhilesh-led state government for making tall claims over the measures to spruce-up law and order situation in the state but he and his alliance partner were going places to seek vote for tainted and gang rape-accused minister and mining mafia, Gayatri Prajapati in Amethi.The PM called upon the Chief Minister to present a report card of his five year rule and claimed that the after four phases of voting in the state, BJP was having a clear edge.Repeating his resolve to keep going with his crusade against corruption and black money, Modi pointed his fingers at the his rivals saying they were stung by the move as it had hit them hard.Modi also expressed concern about the atmosphere fraught with fear and insecurity in the state especially for girls ."

The use of air-conditioners and fans is reason for the jump in consumption.The state generates around 280MU of power a day through various stations. The state consumes around 190 MU per day during other months. During summer, it goes up to 200MUper day.Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) Managing Director Kumar Naik said the power consumption has crossed 210 MU almost every day. Last week, it touched 214 MU and on Wednesday it reached 217 MU. This is mainly because of AC load, he said. This holds true for households across the state.Naik added that there will be no power shortage even with consumption going up.Apart from regular generation, the state has called for a tender to buy extra power of around 1,000 MW and has signed a memorandum with sugarcane factories to purchase 500MW."

And, surprisingly, the palm-fringed shores keep in store a volley of veg delicacies as well. Konkon cuisine is a potpourri of so many culinary traditions.You will find Tulu preparations along with typical Portuguese dishes from Goa. Our menu is very balanced with equal veg and non-veg options, says executive chef Ashok Eapen.We start with a crunchy raw-mango salad, crisp and refreshing. Paneer cafreal in its spicy-tangy green coating rolls in after that.A variation of the popular chicken dish, the soft paneer pieces just melt in your mouth.Coriander and fresh chillies are the main ingredients in the green paste used for marination, says the chef. The salad bar is elaborate with a solid variety including the desi coconut-and-kappa, egg cocktail and pesto-coated seafood pasta.Next comes the coastal staple, rice, served with three different chutnies and chicken ghee roast. All spices are roasted in ghee for that special flavour and aroma, says the chef. Among the condiments is the truly delectable veppilakkatti, made of tamarind and curry leaves. Dried shrimp powder is roasted with spices and coconut for another while the next one has ground peanut as the main ingredient.Manglorean crab masala is equally spicy and yummy, with a faint flavour of roasted coconut. It goes well with gralic naan, or Kerala paratha or roti for that matter. The masala we use is home ground, its very essential to maintain the spice balance.He adds that another highlight of the menu is Malvani fish curry, prepared using fresh seer fish. Cumin, coriander and black pepper is used for marination and then dry mango is added for the pungency. Its usually served with steamed rice, he says.

(Photo | AP)BAGHDAD: Since Iraqi government forces launched the push to take the western half of Mosul from the Islamic State group last week, about 8,000 people have fled from that part of the city and surrounding villages, the U.N. humanitarian aid agency said Tuesday.The agency, known as OCHA, said it is expanding displacement camps to cope with the increasing numbers of those fleeing Mosul.With the support of the U.S.-led coalition, Iraqi forces began the operation to retake western Mosul on Feb. 19, and have so far captured the city's international airport and a sprawling military base next to it as well some neighbourhoods from the southern edge. Iraq declared eastern Mosul ""fully liberated"" in January, after three months of fierce fighting.The people fleeing western Mosul are ""often exhausted and dehydrated,"" the OCHA statement said, adding that an estimated 250,000 people could flee the fighting in the coming days.It also noted ""high"" trauma casualty rates from western Mosul, with at least 75 civilians treated near the front lines over the past week and warned the situation for the estimated 750,000 civilians remaining in western Mosul ""is desperate"" as supply lines have been cut off, in particular, the highway from Mosul into neighboring Syria.Citing eyewitness accounts, OCHA said civilians still in western Mosul are enduing shortages of everything  from food and water to gas, heating oil and medical supplies. The prices of staples such sugar and potatoes have gone up.Associated Press footage from the village of al-Salam south-west of the Mosul airport shows hundreds of civilians trickling to a gathering point in an open and dusty area, carrying a few of their possessions in bags. Security forces separate the men from the women and children before they are taken away in buses and military pickup trucks.Meanwhile, Iraqi special forces moved into western Mosul's Shuhada neighbourhood amid fierce clashes with IS militants as federal police units continued clearing up Gawsaq, a neighbourhood retaken on Monday from IS, according to special forces and police officers.A mortar round landed in one of the streets, killing three civilians and wounding a fourth, another police officer said, as security forces scrambled to try and evacuate civilians to safe areas. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to reporters.The offensive to capture Mosul is the biggest military operation in Iraq since American troops left in 2011. Iraq's second-largest city has been under IS rule for more than two years and remains the Islamic State group's last urban stronghold in Iraq."
58fd3fe87be9e06c93717f98,Shatterings myths about cancer,http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/health/2017/feb/02/shatterings-myths-about-cancer-1565958.html,2017-02-02,"BENGALURU: Here are the myths that have to be straightened with factsMyth: If you have a family history of cancer, you will get it too.Fact: Although having a family history of cancer increases your risk of developing the disease, it is not a complete prediction of your future health. If you have inherited certain cancer genes that put you at high risk for cancer, your doctor may recommend surgery or medications to reduce the chances.Myth: You can be too old for cancer treatment.Fact: There is no age limit for cancer treatment. Decisions about cancer treatment for older adults should take into consideration the same factors as for younger adults and should not focus on the persons age alone. Many older patients benefit as much as younger patients from treatment. However, someolder adults may have other illnesses that limit the use of specific treatments.Myth: There is no cure for cancer.Fact: Great progress has been made over the last several years in cancer diagnostics and treatment, and many more cancers are now curable. Concerning cancer, there exists a cured status. A patient is declared cured if treatment is successful and the patient is in remission, which is the disappearance of the signs and symptoms of cancer, for a certain amount of time, depending on the type of cancer.Myth: Radiation causes hair loss.Fact: Because radiation is a very site-specific treatment, the symptoms and side effects are related to where the beam is aimed. Patients who receive radiation treatment on their scalp area will lose their hair, and those who receive radiation anywhere else will not lose hair on their head, but may lose hair at the site of treatment.Myth: Only women get breast cancer.Fact:Breast cancer occurs mainly in women, but men can get it too, because men alsohave breast tissue and can develop breast cancer.Myth: Super foods prevent cancerFact: Some foods such as blueberries, beetroot, broccoli, garlic and green tea are known as cancer-preventing super foods. These foods are certainly good for your health and are known to have effects considered to be helpful in the fight against cancer, such as containing antioxidants or helping to remove toxic elements in the body. However, it would be naive to look at any particular food as a protection against cancer.Myth: Cancer treatment hurts more than it curesFact: One of the biggest reasons for this myth about cancer is due to the fact that many cancers are detected at a late stage where an aggressive course of treatment is usually required to have a chance of recovery. At late stages of cancer, the disease would have spread to other places in the body and survival rate is usually very low. The truth is that when cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, success rates using conventional treatment tend to be significantly higher.Myth: Cell phones, computers and microwave ovens cause cancer through radiation Fact: When it was found that the radioactive fallout from the World War 2 atomic bombs and Chernobyl meltdown resulted in many cases of cancer caused by radiation, people began to associate radiation with cancer. The fact is that cell phones, computers and microwave ovens only use low-frequency radio waves that do not damage your genes and cause cancer.Myth: All cancers are the same and can be treated the same wayFact: Not only are there over 100 types of cancer, but each cancer reacts differently in different people. Even in people with the same type of tumour in the same body part, the cancer could be caused by different types of genetic changes and should be treated differently.Myth: Cancer is very painfulFact: It is actually quite rare for cancer to be painful. One of the biggest problems with cancer is that many types of cancer may present little to no symptoms, and diagnosis may only come at a later, advanced stage. Most of the pain that people attribute to cancer is the discomfort caused by side effects of cancer treatment such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.Myth: Only smokers get lung cancerFact: While smokers may have a very high risk of suffering from lung cancer, they are not the only ones. Your genetic disposition or family history can affect your risk of getting lung cancer. Exposure to substances such as asbestos, radon, uranium, arsenic and second hand smoke can also increase the chance of developing lung cancer.Myth: Sugar makes cancer worseFact: This myth is likely based on a study showing that cancer cells consume more glucose (sugar) than ordinary cells. Some people came to the conclusion that sugar was effectively feeding the cancer, which led to the belief that reducing sugar intake can starve cancer cells. All our cells consume glucose for energy, regardless of whether they are cancerous.Myth:Cancer is a modern diseaseFact: Cancer has only started becoming highly prominent over the last century, and many people have this notion that cancer is a disease caused by modernisation and technology. The reality is that cancer has been known for thousands of years and documented by ancient Egyptian and Greek physicians. One of the biggest reasons why cancer is a lot more common these days is mainly due to a combination of longevity and information.The author is an HoD and Sr. Consultant Medical Oncology st Mazumdar Shaw Cancer Center, Narayana Health City."

When I do not get to eat in the next half an hour, I start feeling emotional and sad. I am 36-years-old and I started having this issues when I turned 30.Is this anything to worry about?During hunger when the blood sugar becomes low (hypoglycaemia) it is common for some people to get headaches. In order to avoid this, do not be on empty stomach for a long time. Carry some snacks like fruits or biscuits with you so that you can immediately eat when you get hungry.

This is also very common. If you want to stop coffee, you can do so gradually by reducing the quantity.

Another option is to switch to decaffeinated coffee and taper gradually.I get a severe headache when I am on my periods. Is headache a symptom of menstruation?What you are experiencing is probably menstrual migraine which is due to hormonal changes that occur during menstrual periods. Adequate rest, good sleep, avoiding coffee, avoiding chocolates and foods containing cheese, Ajinomoto, all these are some of the things that will help decrease the headache during periods. If it is severe you can take some medications after consulting with your doctor.Can you tell me the method to tie the headband in a right way when suffering from headache?Some patients report help with tying a headband. There is no specific method to tie the band. Avoid tying the headband very tight. Untie the headband after 10 minutes. Give a break for 2-3 minutes then you can use again. You can apply ice pack and that would also help the headache.ConsultantHeadache Clinic,Fortis Hospital,Bannerghatta Road"

But if you are going for Goan traditional food, which the pub claims is their speciality, hit the main course first, I would say.The plain rice served with salad and pickle along with Goan Prawns Curry was delicious. The curry was rich and creamy and the Thai-based vegetable curry was a delight. Made in coconut milk gravy, it tasted sweet and looked richer than its non-vegetarian counterpart.We tried a couple of starters along with some cocktails. The Fiery Crispy Potato had the crispy wedges glazed with hot and spicy red sauce. Cooked in oriental style with bell peppers and onions, the starter looked colourful and bright against the dim lighting of the restaurant. The sauce and bell peppers made it very spicy and reminds one of masala fries.The description for the Bollywood Crackers in the menu reads crispy, crunchy, cheesyrest is a secret. But the rest in this case turned out to be a disappointing. The round patties were crunchy and cheesy, but also sour and oily. You may not enjoy this one unless you are a cheese lover.The Chicken Cafreal is served with pav. Cooked in Goan style with coriander and mint flavour, giving it a green tinge. It lacks the said flavours. The meat was a little hard and did not look appetising.The Spicy Prawns in Port Wine was better than the other starters. Do not go by its look. It does not look interesting but tastes better compared to the rest. Simmered in butter, port wine and crushed red pepper, the prawns were served, topped with chilli flakes. It had a strong flavour of vinegar and tasted sweet and sour.The cocktails lacked alcohol punch. The Watermelon basil is said to be well balanced drink to cool you down with a refreshing mix ginger, basil and vodka but you could barely feel the kick, making it just like a juice. The Lemon Drop is suggested as a tangy refreshing vodka cocktail with a burst of fresh lemon. Well, you feel the burst of fresh lemon, making it taste more like a fresh lime juice, rather than a cocktail.It lacks the alcohol punch. The Lusty Chocolate has a consistency of melted chocolate and icecream. The menu reads this sweet version made of vodka, chocolate syrup, baileys and fresh cream is so sophisticated in taste that you dont want to share. It reads true, you wouldnt really like to share, not because it is a sophisticated drink but the mix of milk, cream and alcohol was not soothing. To be safe with the choice, you can go for Mai Tai or the Orange Blossom. The Orange Blossom is a vodka-based tangy and refreshing drink.Among desserts, Bebinca, a Goan dessert is a good choice. The pudding, made with flour, sugar, egg yolk and coconut, is served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, topped with chocolate sauce. You can feel the sugar syrup lingering in your mouth. Definitely my favourite pick from the dinner night."

The three flavoured sauces  wasabi, chilly flakes and sweet  gave each dumpling a distinct flavour.The next highlight was the flaky rice that livened up the main course. Be it the Philipino Adobo Chicken rice or the Korean Kimchi Bokkeumbap, the long-grained rice was well cooked and the ingredients were well-blended. Fish Ginger Scallion Fish that was served with Hunan noodles was aromatic, but I expected more with the taste. The steamed fish cooked Vietnamese style was a bit soggy by the time I dug in. However, the noodles, like the dumplings, were not oily.The vegetarian Bulgur and Bean Kibbeh, a Middle-Eastern dish fell short of flavours, but the grainy cracked wheat ball went well with the smooth texture of the white sauce. Vegetable wantons that looked like shells spread out was topped with soy sauce. The stuffing of the wantons was thronged with veggies. Chicken Jujeh Kebab Salad, bountiful in fresh veggies including red cabbage, lettuce capsicums and diced pineapples and lime, was a fresh delight.The chicken was marinated to its core, but was a bit too heavy to qualify for a salad.The desserts, Date Halwa Martabak was like a thin Kerela Ada with finely minced date stuffing.

58fd6d597be9e06c9371bcf9,Has Uttar Pradesh voted for hung Assembly? Exit poll today to offer indicators,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/mar/09/has-uttar-pradesh-voted-for-hung-assembly-exit-poll-today-to-offer-indicators-1579333.html,2017-03-09,"NEW DELHI: About 60 per cent of the electorate in 40 Assembly segments spread over seven districts -- roughly comprising 10 per cent of the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh assembly -- voted in the last phase of polling on Wednesday, bringing the curtain down on a marathon and vitriol-filled State elections.What stands out, interestingly, is that polling peaked to around 63.84 per cent and 66.17 per cent (the final figures of Election Commission) in the first two phases of the elections in western UP, and waned in the in-between phases, and peaked again in the final phase to touch 60 per cent (provisional EC figures) in eastern UP.In the first two phases, the high polling was attributed to the disaffected Jat community's response to demonetisation, unkept promises, unsatisfactory minimum support price to sugarcane crop and sundry other issues. The Jats, who had overwhelming voted for the BJP in 2014, were seen to be returning to Ajit Singh's RLD.By the time the long-drawn seven-phase elections came to an end, the narrative had changed. The BJP seems to have bounced back in the last two phases. The high turnout on Wednesday, and prior to that on March 4, by all indications seems to have gone in favour of the BJP.However, as far as the buzz goes, the UP could be headed for a hung assembly, with the BJP perhaps emerging as the single largest party and BSP a close second or even overtaking the saffron party. The exit polls, expected to roll out on Thursday evening, may throw more light on this preliminary assessment.Analysts believe a hung house could be a high-likelihood result of this turnaround. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah stepping up the campaign seems to have changed the narrative around, helping the BJP push its tally up and create a mini-surge, even if not exactly a sweep like 2014.The minority vote, seen to be one of the crucial determinants, started shifting to the BSP in the last three phases, which had a concentration of Muslim-dominated seats.Both the BJP and the BSP, which are seen to be running for the top tally, started picking up only after the third phase. The other reason for the hung house possibility is the fact that it went from a triangular to a multi-cornered contest. While the ruling Samajwadi Party tied up with the Congress, the BJP is in alliance with Apna Dal and Bharatiya Samaj Party, and only BSP contested alone.In the final analysis, the Samajwadi Party, which banked entirely on the performance record of the Akhilesh Yadav Government, may have been pulled back by its alliance with the Congress and the family feud. Even a section of elderly Yadav voters may not have taken kindly to Akhilesh's fracas with father Mulayam Singh, who was mostly missing from the campaign.While the bitter, high-decibel campaign for five assembly seats in Varanasi overshadowed all other constituencies, the Naxal-affected districts Sonbhadra, Mirzapur and Chandauli too went to vote on Wednesday.

Exit poll today to offer indicators,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/mar/09/has-up-voted-for-hung-assembly-exit-poll-today-to-offer-indicators-1579353.html,2017-03-09,"NEW DELHI: About 60 per cent of the electorate in 40 Assembly segments spread over seven districts -- roughly comprising 10 per cent of the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh assembly -- voted in the last phase of polling on Wednesday, bringing the curtain down on a marathon and vitriol-filled State elections.What stands out, interestingly, is that polling peaked at around 63.84 per cent and 66.17 per cent in the first two phases of the elections in western UP, and waned in the in-between phases, and peaked again in the final phase to touch 60 per cent (provisional EC figures) in eastern UP.In the first two phases, the high polling was attributed to the disaffected Jat communitys response to demonetisation, unkept promises, unsatisfactory minimum support price to sugarcane crop and sundry other issues. The Jats, who had overwhelmingly voted for the BJP in 2014, were seen to be returning to Ajit Singhs RLD.By the time the long-drawn seven-phase elections came to an end, the narrative had changed. The BJP seems to have bounced back in the last two phases. The high turnout on Wednesday, and prior to that on March 4, by all indications seems to have gone in favour of the BJP.However, as far as the buzz goes, the UP could be headed for a hung assembly, with the BJP perhaps emerging as the single largest party and BSP a close second or even overtaking the saffron party. The exit polls, expected to roll out on Thursday evening, may throw more light on this preliminary assessment.Analysts believe a hung house could be a high-likelihood result of this turnaround. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah stepping up the campaign seems to have changed the narrative around, helping the BJP push its tally up and create a mini-surge, even if not exactly a sweep like 2014."

Now, the second largest Indian producer of the ubiquitous plastic  PVC  Chemplast had much humbler origins.When Chemplast was founded on May 4, 1967, the total PVC capacity in India was around 6,000 tons, pointed out chairman of the Sanmar Group N Sankar. Chemplast entered the market with 6,000 tons per annum, but now produces over 360,000 tons, commanding a 50 per cent market share. It also boasts $425 million in revenue and an EBITDA margin of around 15 per cent.But the idea for Chemplastitself came from an innovative attempt to use byproducts. The idea was to make PVC from unique materials, said Sankar. Officials at the Mettur Chemicals and Industrial Corporations Plant in Mettur were trying to figure out a way to use chlorine produced as a byproduct and Chemplasts promoters hit on PVC.But for the first time, they began making the ethylene, the other raw material, from molasses a byproduct of sugar plants, which was going to waste. The method was green, even before the term was coined. It was made from renewable raw materials  sugar and salt (for chlorine), he recalled. The companys DNA retained the fervency for innovation  continuing after Sankars Sanmar Group took over the company in 1977.It was Chemplast, pointed out Sankar, that pioneered zero liquid discharge at the 80-year-old Mettur plant. It was also the first to fully import raw material (ethylene dichloride EDC), establishing coastal facilities on both coasts. However, the company has not had a rose-strewn path to success.Chemplast went through hell in the first few years. There have been extraordinarily good years and very bad years, pointed out Sankar, who started in the company as an unpaid apprentice under its first chief  S Ramaswamy. There were technical difficulties during the first year itself, with the plant remaining shut for three months, recalled Sankar. The devaluation of the Rupee in 1966, increased the project cost by 60 per cent, and price wars reduced PVC prices by 50 per cent. But Chemplast broke even by 1972, and from 1977, has been expanding under Sankar.Now, the industry veteran sees huge potential in PVC in India. There is a big gap between domestic production and demand. Most of this excess consumption is being met by imports. But, there needs to be positive inducement to manufacture here  the costs of setting up here are high, he pointed out.Chemplast however, is planning to expand its suspension PVC capacity to 1 million tonnes, is investing `100 crore in a hydrogen peroxide plant and `325 crore in a joint venture with Kem ONe SAS to produce CPVC. The parent $1.5 billion Sanmar Group has also made a major foray in Egypt through TCI Sanmar and its chemical businesses are set to expand after receiving funding from investment firm Fairfax."

The sugarcane growers in the district were, however, demanding steps to raise the price to Rs 3,000 per tonne.On Saturday, the members of Ganjam District Sugarcane Growers Association staged a dharna in front of the factory demanding hike in procurement price. Addressing the protest meeting, vice-president of the association Lalit Mohan Dash and Rankanidhi Swain criticised the authorities of ACSIL for not considering the plight of the sugarcane growers. They threatened to intensify their agitation over the demands.Later, president of industry management parishad Bipin Bihari Patra and secretary P Tripathy rushed to the spot and pacified the agitators. After discussion, they assured to increase the procurement price of sugarcane and announced the same in the evening.Dash said, Though the hike is very little, we accepted it considering all aspects. Due to increase in input costs, we demanded steps to fix the procurement price at Rs 3,000 per tonne. The sugarcane cultivation area in the district has reduced drastically in last couple of years as the farmers have switched over to other crops for diminishing returns from the sugarcane.Sources said on December 16, a meeting was held between leaders of the association and industry officials over the issue. The industry officials announced to pay procurement price of sugarcane at Rs 2310 per tonne as per the Central Government rate. Later, the association resorted to agitation demanding hike in the price."

Only problem was he named Kerala CM as O Paneerselvam.Far from doing a Jallikattu on Vijayan, Paswan was actually wanting to help the Kerala CM -- an old acquaintance from UF days. Presumably, the mixup -- an inadvertent mistake -- was the result of theTamil Nadu CM being in news thanks to the fierce bull run and the youth uprising thereof.Well, the meeting was of a serious import, and the Kerala CM took the gaffe like a good sport, with a brush of hand, without any invocation of pride. His focus was more on the allocation of rice andsubsidised sugar for distribution among migrant workers and welfare institutions.In his meeting, Vijayan also asked the Centre to extend the rice procurement period for three months. Having rolled out the National Food Security Act in November 2016, under which foodgrains have tobe made available to the poor at a subsidised rate of Rs 1-3 per kg via public distribution system, Kerala is in need of a higher allocation from the Centre.Kerala CM has placed many demands before us. One is increasing foodgrains allocation under NFSA, Paswan told reporters after the meeting. Sources said, the Kerala Chief Minister's basic demand was that his state foodgrains supply for PDS supply should, at least, be restored to the level of pre-NFSA days.While under the NFSA, the state is getting 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains annually, it used to get 16.25 lakh tonnes earlier.There was a bit of hand wringing on the part of the Union Food Minister, who pointed that the Centre has adopted a uniform for all states while allocating foodgrains.Allocation under the NFSA is being made taking into account last three years average foodgrains lifting of the state. And the average was 10 lakh tonnes per annum for Kerala. But more is beinggiven to protect poor people, a Food Ministry official said.Kerala is asking for more allocation under the NFSA as it wants to cover the entire population. And that's beyond the policy of the Centre.Among other demands, the Kerala government has asked more subsidy support as the state wants to sell subsidised sugar to the entire population under the PDS. At present, sugar is supplied to only families of below poverty line (BPL).It has also asked for parboiled rice and additional foodgrains allocation of about 50,000 tonnes per month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the state.The state has also demanded to up the foodgrains allocation to 550 tonnes per month for welfare institutions from the existing monthly allocation of 212 tonnes , while it has sought central support tomake extra payment to state-run FCI labourers.That apart, the Kerala government has asked the Centre to extend rice procurement period for three months."

But it feared they may soon be returned to the North since ""most repatriations happen two months after detention"".""There is no way to sugar coat this: if this group is forced back to North Korea, their lives and safety will be at risk,"" Robertson said.More than 40 North Koreans, including children and pregnant women, have been held by China over the past nine months, Human Rights Watch said, and at least nine forcibly returned to the North.Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have escaped -- most after a deadly famine in the mid-90s -- and settled in the South.North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is believed to have tightened border controls since he came to power after the death of his father Kim Jong-Il in December 2011.The number of refugees arriving in South Korea plunged nearly 50 percent to 1,417 last year."
58fe2d387be9e012bf28616f,Michael Bloomberg to world leaders: Ignore Trump on climate,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/apr/24/michael-bloomberg-to-world-leaders-ignore-trump-on-climate-1597081.html,2017-04-24,"In this Wednesday, July 27, 2016, file photo, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg waves after speaking to delegates during the third day session of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. | APNEW YORK: New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg urged world leaders not to follow President Donald Trump's lead on climate change and declared his intention to help save an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions.Bloomberg, who considered a presidential bid after serving three terms as New York City's mayor, addressed his intensifying focus on climate change in an interview with The Associated Press. He said there was no political motive tied to last week's release of his new book, ""Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet,"" co-authored by former Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope.""I'm not running for office,"" the 75-year-old Bloomberg said.Instead of helping to re-ignite his political career, he said the new book offered a specific policy objective: To help save an international agreement, negotiated in Paris, to reduce global carbon emissions.The Trump administration is debating whether to abandon the pact as the president promised during his campaign. Under the agreement, the U.S. pledged that by 2025 it would reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels, which would be a reduction of about 1.6 billion tons.Bloomberg said he believed the U.S. would hit that goal regardless of what Trump does because of leadership at the state level and market forces already at play in the private sector.""Washington won't determine the fate of our ability to meet our Paris commitment,"" he said in an email Saturday to the AP. ""And what a tragedy it would be if the failure to understand that led to an unravelling of the agreement. We hope this book will help to correct that wrong impression  and help save the Paris deal.""Bloomberg already plays a significant role in shaping some of the nation's fiercest policy debates, having invested millions of dollars in one advocacy group that pushes for stronger gun control and another that promotes liberal immigration policies. In the new book, which follows what a spokeswoman described as $80 million in donations to the Sierra Club in recent years, the New York businessman solidifies his status as a prominent climate change advocate as well.His policy repertoire aligns him with core values of the Democratic Party, although the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent has no formal political affiliation.In the interview, Bloomberg shrugged off conservatives who condemn him as a paternalistic New York elitist. He noted that policies he helped initiate in New York City  including a smoking ban and high taxes on sugary drinks  have eventually caught on elsewhere.""My goal has been to save and improve lives,"" he said. ""Some ways of doing that can be controversial at first, but end up being highly popular and successful.""In his new focus on climate change, Bloomberg directs particularly aggressive language at the coal industry.""I don't have much sympathy for industries whose products leave behind a trail of diseased and dead bodies,"" he wrote in the book. He added: ""But for everyone's sake, we should aim to put them out of business...""Similar language haunted Hillary Clinton's presidential bid last year and fueled criticism from Trump and other top Republicans that Democrats were engaged in a ""war on coal.""Bloomberg offered a pragmatic approach when asked about the political consequences for politicians who embrace such a stance.""The fact is, coal in Appalachia is running out,"" he said, adding that ""Washington can't put generations of people back to work in a dying industry.""Saying that coal miners ""have paid a terrible price,"" Bloomberg also disclosed for the first time plans to donate $3 million to organizations that help unemployed miners and their communities find new economic opportunities. Bloomberg Philanthropies highlights the plight of coal miners in a new film to be featured at the Tribeca Film Festival on Wednesday.He avoided condemning the Trump administration directly, however, largely casting the new president's steps on climate change as irrelevant. The White House declined to comment when asked about Bloomberg's statements.""As it turns out, Trump's election makes the book's message  that the most important solutions lie outside of Washington  even more important and urgent,"" Bloomberg said."

On the same night, a man of the house would be found hanging on a tamarind tree inside the sprawling island in Kollam owned by one feudal family that also lived there.As a teenager, Biju grew up hearing these stories - of ghosts, secrets and a clandestine affair which were real incidents that took place within Bijus home in the 1950s. He was especially intrigued by his great grandfathers alleged love affair with a woman which took place within the egg-white polished walls of his ancestral home. His first short story was based on this subject, titled- Ghost of Martha. Since he was not satisfied with it, he developed it into a full fledged novel. I was very sure I would tell this story one day. Of course, most of it is fiction, says Biju. The novel, according to the banker-turned author, took many years to write.The journeyWhen I embarked on this novel, my first worry was whether my main characters, including the two prominent maids in the story, would have enough to do. The story was set within a six-month time frame. I had to ensure they were kept engaged the entire time. One another factor that affected me a bit was the loneliness of writing a book. I couldnt write more than two pages on most days. I was finding it hard to deal with the loneliness of writing alone, says the first time author.To ward off the solitude, Biju started writing in coffee shops and airports where he was exposed to a lot of noise and people. Of course, there were distractions, but I needed that, he confesses.Style of writingBiju spent many days to create the setting for his novel. I wanted my readers to know how a Christian feudal family in Kerala lived their life. This is why, my maids would be making avial or an orappam while gossiping about the landlord and his family. This was important to me, he said. He spent a lot of time also detailing the house and the surroundings, the glaze of the sugarcane flowers during sunrise and the Chinese nets.Meanwhile, Biju believes in using a lot of prose in his novel, unlike many authors in India who are trying to keep their language very simple. I need people to remember certain moments as they are, which is why I prefer not to keep things and dialogues too simple, he adds.A huge fan of writer Arundhati Roy and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Biju is happy to have received feedback from friends who told him that there is a slight semblance in his writing to the God of Small Things author. Biju, is someone who believes in finishing his book in less than 300 pages. People are disturbed these days. There are so many distractions that people dont want to spend a lot of time on too many pages, he adds. A few filmmakers have already approached Biju to convert the book into a movie. If things go well, lets see, it will be a very positive move, says Biju who is also producer Sofia Pauls brother.His next bookRight now, Biju is writing his second book loosely based on the mythological character of Madhavi, who is given to three kings as a barter in exchange for 800 horses.Even though this has taken its pretext from a mythological story, it is quite personal too. It is a story of love. Imagine how a woman like Madhavi would have felt to love a man she didnt know and then suddenly give him up along with the baby she had with him for another man! After bearing the children of two more kings, she is forced to come back to her fathers house, he adds."

I know that I am respected in my field. I see it in how my opponents play against me,"" said Sharapova who was controversially handed a wild card into this week's Stuttgart event, a clay-court tournament sponsored by Porsche, one of her headline backers.She was even given a Wednesday start as that's the day her ban -- imposed for testing positive for meldonium at last year's Australian Open -- comes to an end.Sharapova, who starts her Stuttgart campaign against Italian veteran Roberta Vinci, had been taking the over-the-counter cardiac supplement when it was within the rules but was later reclassified as a prohibited drug.Far from being remorseful, Sharapova recently hit out at tennis authorities for failing to give her sufficient warning that meldonium had become a banned substance.The Russian will step onto the centre court at 1830 (1630 GMT) on Wednesday and could not have picked a better tournament for her return, having won the Stuttgart title three times, and suffering just one defeat.If she gets through her opener, she could face Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, one of her fiercest critics, in the second round.Radwanska, the sixth-seed in Stuttgart, expects a 'fierce' return from the Russian but says Sharapova should have had to qualify on merit rather than being given a free pass on a wild card.""This kind of entry into the tournament should apply to players who dropped in the ranking because of injury, illness or some other random event. Not for those suspended for doping,"" said Radwanska.Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud believes his client's rivals are motivated solely by jealousy especially with Sharapova battling also for a French Open wild card.""All those 'journeyman' players like Radwanska and Caroline Wozniacki who have never won a slam and the next generation passing them. They are smart to try to keep Maria out of Paris,"" Eisenbud said.""NO Serena, NO Maria, NO Vika, NO Petra, it's their last chance to win a slam,"" he added, a nod to the absence of pregnant Serena Williams, Petra Kvitova and Victoria Azarenka, expected to return in July after having a baby.Sharapova can expect plenty of support from the Stuttgart organisers as her return is the highlight of the tournament's 40th-anniversary celebrations.As an ambassador for Porsche, she is sure of a warm welcome. Her confectionary brand -- Sugarpova -- will have a stand in the tournament's retail village.Tournament director Markus Guenthardt knows her presence will boost ticket sales.""Her return to the Porsche Arena is a fabulous present for our fantastic spectators and is certain to be one of the sporting and emotional highlights of our anniversary tournament,"" he said.As well as Radwanska, many of her other potential Stuttgart rivals have made it clear they disapprove of her getting a helping hand into the main draw.Germany's Angelique Kerber, this year's top seed and the only player to have beaten Sharapova in Stuttgart, said her place should have gone to local talent.""It's a German tournament, and we [have] so many good German players, so this is also a little bit strange,"" said Kerber.""It's also strange for the players, that she can walk on site on Wednesday and she can play on Wednesday.""Dominika Cibulkova, the third seed, claims Sharapova is benefiting from unfair treatment.""It's not about her, but everyone who was doping should start from zero,"" said the Slovakian."

But there have been complaints of charging more than MRP and declaring dual MRP. Recently, consumer court NCDRC had imposed a penalty on a multiplex for selling water above MRP.There is no need to have a new law to regulate MRP. The existing Act is sufficient and we have enough powers to take action against violators, Paswan told reporters after the national consultative meeting on legal metrology here.The state governments have been asked to be more vigilant and take prompt action against violators. They have also been asked to create consumer awareness, he said.Besides the MRP issue, Paswan expressed concern over inaccuracy in critical instruments like thermometer and sugar testing devices used in daily life.Wrong and imprecise measurement builds mistrust and is often a source of safety hazard... There are doubts expressed sometimes regarding the accuracy of petrol pumps, and weighing machines used in agricultural mandis, he said.In the wake of growing trade and commerce, Paswan said there should be more efforts to build consumer confidence in the system and stop manufacturers from indulging in unfair practices and pushing sub-standard products in the market.Issues of legal, administrative, operational challenges were discussed at the national consultation meeting and a strategy for a more coordinated and focused approach for the future was agreed upon.It was decided to give awards to three states for best legal metrology administration, earmark funds for creating consumer awareness programme and set up national and regional museums on legal metrology."

Lets see; we hope he come back bearing good news. Otherwise we may have to die here in Delhi, as we would if we go back home with the loans still due, said P Ayyakannu.They have also met Uma Bharti, water minister, who has spoken to them about their demands regarding interlinking of national rivers. Bharti reassured the farmers that feasibility studies are being conducted regarding the interlinking of national rivers.However, the minister, who was accompanied by the deputy speaker of Lok Sabha M Thambidurai, did not address their demands to stop the construction of the Karnataka governments proposed dam at Mekedatu on river Cauvery.Most of the 100 odd farmers are from Trichy, Karur and Thanjavur regions, and they have been protesting to gain the attention of the central government, so that their loans from nationalised banks may be written off.Loans from cooperative banks were written off on the orders of Amma (Jayalalitha), but the state government cannot do much about the loans from nationalised banks. The central government will have to direct them to write it off, said Ayyakannu, while also claiming that the drought relief package for Tamil Nadu farmers needs to be revised, as the current one hardly covers their losses.The burden of debt compounded by alleged drought like conditions, which ruined both their summer and winter crops, forced over 60 farmers to commit suicide, and killed many others.I had taken a loan of R 1 lakh almost 5-6 years ago. I have not been able to pay it back, and now with added interest, the amount I owe has increased to Rs. 3-4 lakhs. Last year, the bank issued a default notice saying that they may take over my property, which my wife received while I was not home . She had a heart attack and passed away when she read it, recalls a teary-eyed G Mahadevan.Mahadevan is one among the many voices that are fighting to be heard, who have vowed that they will continue to protest until their demands are met.G Ramesh, a farmer who owes Rs 1 lakh to banks, threatened to commit suicide on Thursday by tying a noose around his neck and attaching the other end of the rope to a tree at Jantar Mantar, while echoing the demands of the farmers for a solution to the drying up of Cauvery river when it reaches Tamil Nadu. I have two wells. They have both dried up. If they release some of the Cauvery water, then this will recharge my wells too, said Ramesh, who had to be rescued by fire fighters from the tree top.The farmers have proposed the Smart Waterways Project, conceptualised by AC Kamaraj as the viable solution.They have also been demanding fair and just prices for their products. An MLAs salary has increased by 220 times since 1970 to 2016. The labour charges to harvest sugar cane has increased from Rs5 in 1970 to Rs 750 to Rs 1000 in 2016. However, the price of paddy and sugarcane has only increased by 22-25 times, said Mahadevan.The farmers had initially said they would be on hunger strike, but have started eating at the behest of politicians and other volunteers who have gathered in solidarity of the farmers. Many of the protesting farmers are over 50 years of age and suffer from blood sugar, blood pressure and respiratory problems.Ayyakannu, the leader of the movement, said that with over 20 MPs and many other politicians visiting them he has hope; but many others are not so sure.We do not know if the politicians will really work in our favour or not. They have said they will. So we are waiting, with hope; we have no other option, said one of the farmers"

Jogawat was kept under observation for 24 hours after he complained of minor fever and a burning sensation in his urinary tract on Tuesday night.It was a minor infection. It subsided after initial treatment. I am doing well now, Jogawat told to Hindustan Times. Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, who had successfully performed a bariatric surgery on Jogawat ,said he is currently stable and will be able to rejoin the workforce soon.Jogawat had been suffering from a urinary infection for a while. However, the condition was unrelated to his bariatric surgery, which took place in Mumbai. He called me after persistent episodes of fever and chills. I requested the local doctor to run primary tests and to not put him on heavy antibiotics as the complication wasnt severe, said Dr Lakdawala.The Neemuch doctor treating Jogawat, Dr Vipul Garg, said he was discharged after a day and will be on oral medication for the next five days. The patient came to the hospital complaining of chills and a severe burning sensation while urinating. We initially thought that this may have resulted from the major surgery he underwent, but later realised it was a urine infection said Dr Garg.Dr Lakdawala said the infection was probably related to his diabetes level. However, as Jogawat is on a strict diet, his sugar levels are expected to come under control. The doctor asked me if we needed to do a CT scan. I told him that Jogawat was stable and there was no need to for additional tests, he said.ReadCop fat-shamed by Shobhaa De develops post-operation complicationsFat-shamed MP cop Daulatram Jogawat undergoes surgery in MumbaiEman Ahmed vs Daulatram Jogawat: Two obese patients with different treatment"

We found irregularities in the ration distribution at several shops, said Singh.We conducted raids to ensure that the ration shops provide basic necessities to the citizens. At various shops, we found people indulging in malpractices and ill-doings, so we took action accordingly. An FIR was also filed regarding this. During the raids, we recovered 42 quintals of rice and 48 quintals of wheat, which were unaccounted, costing around Rs 23,000, said Singh.On April 8, we had conducted raids at five ration shops in Noida and Bisrakh, where none of the shops had any supervising official present to distribute ration commodities. We have booked the officials and prompt action will be taken against them accordingly, said Vijay Bahadur, regional food security officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Singh informed that the district administration had carried a similar raid and inspection campaign in 2016 as well.Last year, we had conducted inspection of 1,002 shops and raids at 157 shops, where a total of four FIRs were lodged.

The central bank left policy lending rate (repo) unchanged and hiked borrowing rates (reverse repo) at the last policy review on April 7.RBI has already signalled that uncertain monsoon and low statistical base effect will keep CPI inflation at 4.5% in the first half and 5% in the second half of 2017-18. The government may also increase the minimum support prices (MSPs) of crops, which will put an upward pressure on inflation, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings.A pick up in new currency in circulation helped revive consumer demand after a bout of severe cash crunch during the demonetisation drive of November-December of 2016.The March inflation number was still higher compared with the 0.45% fall in WPI during March 2016, as prices of petrol, diesel and minerals, firmed up due to an upward trend in global prices.Festival demand pushed up prices of vegetables by 5.7% and fruits by 7.6%. However, potato prices fell 17%, onion 10.8% and pulses 6.1% from a year ago.Mineral prices were up 23.5% while fuels were costlier by 18.2% as petrol and diesel prices were revised up.Last week, government data showed a rise in the prices of sugar, confectionary, snacks and fruits during Holi pushed up Indias consumer price inflation (CPI) to 3.81% in March from 3.65% in February.The slowing pace of remonetisation, or pumping new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes into circulation, during March to replace the scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November, helped inflation to stay within 4% in the financial year ending March 2017.Consumption and investment activity were dampened after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced the bold decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.While the demonetisation weeded out Rs 15.44 lakh crore or 86% of currency from circulation, the government and RBI has been able to pump in about Rs 13.35 lakh crore worth of new notes so far."
58fedcf97be9e0429666aa70,Are Maratha protests in Maharashtra losing steam?,http://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/are-maratha-protests-in-maharashtra-losing-steam/story-fyoZnPdLTwDJSAO5HCW1lN.html,2017-01-09,"By late September 2016, the silent Maratha protests had reached a crescendo in the state with nearly 20 districts  more than one third of Maharashtra  covered by agitators demanding reservation in jobs and education for the community.The protests by the dominant community that makes up 32% of Maharashtras population had rattled the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, even as rumours about his ouster started making rounds in political circles.Just four months later, the Maratha protests, seem to have lost its steam with Fadnavis-led government having the last laugh. On Sunday, in an indication that the protest organisers are confused, the plan to conduct a mega march in Mumbai on January 31 was put on hold, fearing a tepid response. The organisers fear that the ensuing code of conduct for the local elections including the crucial Mumbai civic polls will hamper their supporters  engaged in campaigning for their respective parties  from putting up a strong show of strength.And, therein lies the irony of the apolitical protests of the community and also perhaps its Achilles Heel.The faceless protest marches that claim to be non-partisan and leaderless have nevertheless been organised and oiled by workers across all major political parties. Initiated by hardline Maratha groups that have had an allegiance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the protests were soon hijacked by all parties, with local Maratha leaders contributing to the effort with resources or numbers.To make matters even more complicated, a section of the organisers from the Sambhaji Brigade, enthused by the ground swell of support of the community, is now making a foray in active politics. Sambhaji Brigade plans to contest a majority of the upcoming municipal corporations as well as Zilla Parishad polls.It is very difficult for the discontent of the Maratha community to be consolidated as a vote bank in favour of one or the other party. While NCP is seen as a party of Marathas, all political parties including BJP have presence of Maratha leaders. The votes will then be spilled locally on party lines especially in local polls, said a senior Congress leader and former minister.He added, ``This also brings down their capacity to impact or affect state politics in a big way unless there is a clear leadership or ownership of the unrest with one party.The state government has also been successful in stemming the protests by offering sops like the fee waiver for all Economically Backward Students up to an income limit of Rs6 lakh per annum that will extend to the Maratha community (at the cost of Rs 700 crore to the exchequer). Besides, the government recently laid the foundation stone for the Shivaji memorial (long standing demand of the community) and set up the state backward class commission to look into the demands for the reservation by the community.For the time being these efforts and local polls has diluted the protests. But, the issue is far from over and is likely to heat up once again before 2019 polls.There are two reasons for this. One is that the central demand of the community for reservation is jobs and education is unlikely to get implemented in two years. Secondly, the BJP government is seen as targeting the established Maratha leadership that controls rural economy through its network of sugar co-operatives and co-operative banks.Political analysts feel that the upcoming elections in district councils or zilla parishads (ZPs) that are responsible for rural administration will give an indication of how the Maratha protests issue can impact politics in the state.The Marathas issue has a stronger resonance in rural areas and hence will be important in ZP polls. The polls results will tell us whether the community is likely to do any strategic voting. Secondly, there has been a buzz in certain areas that Other Backward Class (OBC) may consolidate their vote bank by rejecting Maratha candidates and this could affect certain parties, said Surendra Jondhale, political analyst."
58fedf757be9e0429666ac1a,Delhi's digital ration shops stuck in planning overdrive,http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/delhi-s-digital-ration-shops-stuck-in-planning-overdrive/story-JuCRGy73psJA27E3mxmSHJ.html,2017-04-14,"More than a year since digitisation of ration shops was announced in Delhi, the project has hit a roadblock.The delay has happened because both the food & supplies (F&S) department and the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi were preparing their own Request for Proposal (RFP) for the same project.The F&S department made its proposal and then the DDC drafted another RFP. After a lot of discussion, it was decided to follow the one prepared by the DDC. But eventually, issues emerged in that RFP and they had to be corrected. The finance department is reviewing the file now. All this took a lot of time, an official said.Originally planned to be completed by March 31, the work of installing Point of Sale (PoS) machines at Fair Price Shops (FPS)  popularly known as ration shops  is unlikely to begin until July. The proposal is yet to get clearance from all departments. Once all comments and objections are addressed, only then tenders will be floated, another official said.According to sources, it would take at least four months for PoS machines to be operational at a majority of FPSs in the capital. Delhi has 2,282 FPSs, with nearly 72.8 lakh people using them. By now, all of them were supposed to distribute essential commodities like wheat, rice and sugar through detection of fingerprint or iris of the beneficiaries.Card holders sufferEven the pilot project in which 42 such shops were installed with PoS machines have almost been withdrawn. At present, only 28 FPSs have functioning PoS devices. Food and supplies officers have complained that the machines installed in the few FPSs are not working efficiently. These are not user-friendly and have poor battery life. Many a times, fingerprints do not match and network is a big problem, an officer said on condition of anonymity.In all such cases, while ration shop owners should ideally mark such transactions under Transactions with N (No) response from Aadhaar, they invariably mark them under Household yet to take ration, implying that the beneficiary has chosen not to take home her share.While many ration card holders are visiting these shops to get their monthly supplies, they are returning empty handed. Worse is that the system does not even show that they attempted buying commodities. Instead, it only suggests that the card holder never came to claim her share  which is probably the biggest glitch.The delay is despite the fact that Delhi is one of the easiest cities to implement the project as it has 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding. This means the government did not have to spend anything extra in getting biometrics of ration card holders as Aadhaar cards in Delhi are mandatory for getting enrolled under the National Food Security Act, 2013."

The state government also announced that more than 140 farmers took their lives between October and December 2016 because of crop failure. The agrarian crisis in the state is a fallout of a weather vagary that hasnt received much notice. The northeast monsoon  critical to the southern peninsula, particularly Tamil Nadu  has been a failure, with overall rainfall between October and December 45.2 per cent below normal. This is the worst since the 48.3 per cent deficit recorded in 2011. In October 2016, 22 districts of Karnataka were declared drought hit. As 2016 drew to a close, South Indias combined reservoir levels were 22 percentage points less than the average water availability over the past 10 years. The situation has serious implications for crops like paddy and coconut and will impact milk and sugar production, especially in Karnataka.The poor northeast monsoon, this year, is a double blow for the southern states. Tamil Nadu, Kerala and south interior Karnataka and coastal Karnataka had already reported respective shortfalls of 19 per cent, 34 per cent, 21 per cent and 21 per cent during the southwest monsoon (June-September). The corresponding deficits of 62 per cent, 61 per cent, 70 per cent and 63 per cent reported for the northeast season makes matters worse for these regions.The deficit in the northeast monsoon is likely to have implications for the economy. It may also accentuate inter-state river disputes, especially the sharing of Cauvery waters. While it is too early to predict the exact shortfalls in crop production, sowing figures from South India do not portend well. Tamil Nadu, for example, had targeted 14.5 lakh hectares under rice in 2016-17, according to the agriculture ministry. But barely seven lakh hectares was under the plough by January 5. This is 33 per cent less than the five-year sowing average of 10.68 lakh hectares. The shortfall will also impact livelihoods and have repercussions on the mechanisms to deal with crop failure. So far, less than a third of the drought hit areas in Karnataka have been covered by the Pradhan Mantri Gram Fasal Bima Yojana. The northeast monsoon is considered a fringe player in the agro-climate story. But imperatives of the economy and the needs to secure peoples livelihoods require a rethinking on that front.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Assuming it was appendicitis, his employers admitted him to a hospital in his hometown.It was only when his condition worsened that Venkatesh was diagnosed to be suffering from a rare condition called Intestinal Ischemia. Acute mesenteric ischemia is a type of intestinal ischemia that usually affects the small intestine. It occurs due to lack of supply of oxygen-rich blood to the intestine, resulting in the death of intestine cells.The small intestine is six metres long in adults. It is where 90% of the digestion and absorption happens, according to doctors. Providing Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) or intravenous nutrition would have been costly.Unlike most other cases, the donor for intestinal transplant is a cadaver. There were times when we had to postpone the operation as the condition of the patient was not stable due to elevated sugar levels, fluctuating blood pressure and even infections due to the TPN, said Dr Mahesh Gopasetty, consultant transplant surgeon, Apollo Hospitals.It was in March 2017 that the procedure was conducted. Today, the recipient, who is near normal, has begun consuming food again.The techniqueA technique was used where intestinal transplant was performed without creating a stoma. The transplanted intestine was connected to a part of the large intestine instead of creating a stoma (opening) where a loop of the intestine or a bag is connected.The excreta is carried on through it. With this, the patient can continue his bowel movement in a normal manner without any discomfort of carrying a bag with him always."

This is the worst since the 48.3 per cent deficit recorded in 2011.For Tamil Nadu, Kerala and southern Karnataka, the poor northeast monsoon rains come as a double whammy.

The corresponding deficits of 62 per cent, 61 per cent, 70 per cent and 63 per cent reported for the northeast season only make matters worse. Tamil Nadu, not surprisingly, has declared drought.Extended dry weather in Tamil Nadu and southern Karnataka could have a production impact, especially in milk and sugar where supply conditions are already tightening.There is no such problem of moisture deficiency in the main rabi belt of northern and central India. The current cold wave, triggered by widespread rain/snowfall activity over the western Himalayan region, should help the standing wheat, mustard and chana crops. While the northeast monsoon rains were bad in these regions as well  causing concerns till early this month  the fact is that the situation is far better than in 2015 and 2014.

After all, it is in these hot dusty months that the city comes into its own. We temporarily get rid of all the disloyal super-rich who dump Delhi for London and New York.Our avenues are again lined with the extravagant yellow bloom of Amaltas trees. The refrigerated cold water and lemonade trolleys too return on the streets, decked with roses, marigolds and lemons. And how can you claim to be a Delhiite if you have never licked off a midnight orange bar at India Gate grounds?However, one element of Delhi summer is fast receding into living memories of its inhabitants  the numberwalli kulfi.When did you have it last? No, not kulfi, the Indian-style flavored ice-cream served on a stick, but the numberwalli kulfi?It has become a rare sight.Id spotted my lifes first numberwalli kulfi only a few years ago in Old Delhis Bulbuli Khana, near Empress Razia Sultans tomb. There it was  the kulfi cart fitted with a desi-style roulette wheel.Numberwalli kulfi offers the thrill of a Las Vegas casino. Drop a coin in the kulfi carts spinning wheel and you win as many kulfis as the number on which the coin comes to rest. Sometimes the cart is equipped with a kind of pinball game, and if thats the case, then you ought to manoeuvre your green kancha (small glass ball) into the highest value square. If the ball lands in number five, you get five kulfis.Curiously, I never saw such a kulfi cart in any other part of the city. My second sighting, two years ago, too happened in Old Delhi. And then I never sighted the numberwalli kulfi again until last week while entering the Walled City through the monumental Turkman Gate.The cart was fitted with the most elementary version of the pinball game: there was no spring to hit the kancha. There was actually no kancha, but a small plastic ball. Lots of nails were stuck up at one end of a creaky wooden block with numbered spaces between them.I hit at the ball with full concentration. The ball tumbled down into the array of nails and, alas, fell into number one. I deserved just one kulfi but the kind vendor instead took out two of those sugary milky trophies from his wooden ice box  the second stick was for free, he said. The summer was a steal."

The center acts as a transit home for injured cats or others trapped after they were found in human habitations.According to the forest department, there is an increase in leopard sightings during the harvest season. Female leopards find these tall dense fields a suitable shelter for giving birth and rearing their cubs but since farmers fear for their life, they scare away the mother, said a local forest official from Nashik. We have observed numerous instances where the mothers abandon their cubs, never to return.On early morning December 26, the cub was spotted by farmers from near Chapadgaon village, Nashik while they were harvesting their crop. The cub was shivering when we found him and immediately informed the forest department, said Vilas Darade, sugarcane farmer from Chapadgaon.Veterinarians from Wildlife SOS and forest officials spent a week waiting for the mother to come back to the spot by isolating the cub, especially at night. However, she did not return, said officials. Young leopards, especially less than six-months old, cannot survive on their own. The chief wildlife warden of the forest department decided to place it under the permanent care of Wildlife SOS, said Yuvraj Mohite, assistant conservator of forest, Nashik.The baby leopard is quite active, said Ajay Deshmukh, veterinarian, Wildlife SOS. A preliminary medical examination was conducted and she was checked for external parasites and injuries.He added that she was lucky to have completed the cycle where she required her mothers milk on a daily basis.

(HT Photo)According to both, there is a qualitative difference between the way the two countries approach tea -- while its a part of Chinese culture, in India its just another business.The entire value chain from tea planters to growers and traders have a lot to learn from China, both Robertson and Lochan said.The Chinese have blended their culture, history and understanding with scientific research to produce more than 10,000 different tea varieties. India has only few a varieties, said Robertson.Indian producers readily agreed. S K Saria, the MD of Songachi Tea Company that owns four tea gardens in Darjeeling hills and Dooars in North Bengal said, In China and oriental countries, tea is not a commodity but is virtually worshipped and treated as a rare gift of God.Read: Drink tea to heal everything from cough to cavitiesThe Chinese are far better than us in terms of agriculture practices, machinery, processing units and products. There are many lessons to learn for India from China while China has nothing as such to learn from us, said Ashok Kumar, the partner of Goomtee Tea Estate in Darjeeling.The bulk of tea consumed in India is of CTC variety which is boiled with milk and sugar. (HT Photo)In 2004 Rajiv Lochan became the first entrepreneur to introduce Indian tea in China. Chinese tea industry has lots to offer in terms of innovation, entrepreneurship and quality and welfare of the workers to India, he remarked.Lochan, who owns Lochan Tea Limited, told HT, China has more demand for India CTC tea while a miniscule part of the export comprises premium Darjeeling tea.However, according to Lochan, there is one lacunae in the Chinese tea industry and that is the absence of a regulator like the Tea Board of India.Read: Starbucks is brewing tea in India, launches Teavana speciality teasAccording to unofficial figures, in 2016 China imported four million kg of Indian tea, while India imported only a few thousand kgs. India imposes 130% import duty on tea from China, while China imposes only 17% duty on tea from India.Green tea is fast becoming popular in Indian cities due to its therapeutic values. (HT Photo)Traders say the high import duty makes Chinese tea expensive in India and only a small quantity in consumed in big hotels.As Chinese workers are healthy they produce more tea, said Lochan. There is also a yawning gap in earnings. A Chinese tea worker gets Rs 1,000 per day while their counterparts in northern parts of West Bengal gets only Rs 131.50 p per day in addition to fringe benefits like ration, housing and medical treatment.Lochan said that Chinese tea workers do not have to worry about their health as the government takes care of their social and health security. India desperately lacks this, he said.However, Indian black tea (CTC variety) has become a fashion for young Chinese. Lochan, who recently attended a tea exhibition in China as a judge, said, Drinking black tea of different flavours has become a fashion statement for the young Chinese. More than 90% of Indian export to China is black (CTC) tea and hardly 10 percent is Darjeeling orthodox tea.Read: Demonetisation leaves lakhs of tea, jute workers in Bengal, Northeast unpaidRobertson also thinks that Indian factories have a long way to go to produce green tea like Chinese factories do. Incidentally, green tea is fast becoming popular among urban Indians for its therapeutic properties.Tea plantation and production began in India in the nineteenth century. The British began it to break the monopoly of the Chinese in the tea industry. Indians took to drinking tea on a large scale after a marketing campaign by the Tea Board in the 1920s. (HT Photo)Chinese tea growers are serious about replantation of tea bushes after certain intervals. It is an area neglected in India. Most of the bushes are very old and the yield is low, said the US businessman.In 1994 Robertson took tourists from the US to China. He also deals in Chinese tea and sells it throughout the world. Years ago I started to make a documentary on Chinese tea industry. It was supposed to be under one hour, but I could never complete it as the history is too rich and varied and needs to run for hundreds of hours, he told HT.Read: More reasons to love your morning chai. A cup of tea a day can keep dementia awayThough China has always remained number one in the world tea production, Kenya the third largest producer has been dominating the world tea export market. India, the second largest producer, is the third largest exporter.China has numerous tea gardens and none is sure of their number. In 2015 the country produced 2,278 million kg compared to 2,096 million kg in 2014. In the same period India produced 1,209 million kg and 1,207 million kg.China contributed 18% in the world tea export while India contributed 13% in world tea export in 2015."

There has been experience of imposing labels on junk food in some countries part of one of the recommendation on the food, said the FSSAI chief.Pawan Kumar Agarwal, CEO of Foods Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). (via Livemint)The FSSAI came into prominence after the Nestle Maggi fiasco, soon after which Agarwal joined as its CEO. An officer with the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Agarwal, sees a huge requirement to make people aware and educate them about food, and help them follow a healthy diet.In the past, he has brought large temples and mosques under the regulators surveillance. Shree Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai, Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in Tirupati and Sai Baba temple in Shirdi, follow safety standards for the Prasad or bhog that they offer to its devotees.The regulators move to introduce junk food label comes at a time when India is going through an era of higher degree of urbanisation. A large number of small towns and cities are being exposed to the American burgers and Italian pastas, and millions of kids are acquiring new tastes. This has led to a debate on introducing a fat tax on junk food.There is a larger problem  obesity. India ranks third after the US and China, with 41 million obese people, according to Global Burden of Disease Study.To control the growing problem, FSSAI had set up a committee to prepare guidelines on healthy diet for Indians. The committee has made eight recommendations in the report, and a lot of it is about public education, Agarwal added.So will there be a special label for junk food? Agarwal said it is under consideration and a final decision will be taken soon.FSSAIs bigger problem will be to regulate local shops selling Indian fried snacks such as samosa and cutlets. That is the challenge There are practical difficulties in the Indian context for street food. You can do it in potato chips, but if someone sells a samosa on the street, it is difficult, Agarwal said.However, Agarwal is not giving up yet. Based on the committee report, he has chaired multiple discussions to see how street food vendors can be regulated. We are applying our mind because there is a lot of public interest Large, vocal and articulate consumer organisations say that something should be done, but the practical problems have to be taken into consideration, Agarwal said."

I broke almost every window pane around my house in Jalandhar without being boycotted by neighbours.Things have changed and how. Now I hear about youngsters, with so much potential, taking to drugs, which is alarming. Drugs will not take them anywhere; sports and studies will. Please dont let drugs kill Punjab.I am also worried about the rising incidence of cancer in the state. I hear about the train from Bathinda, the Cancer Express that carries people for treatment to Rajasthan. Sadly we have brought this scourge upon ourselves through unhealthy farming practices. Our body is what we eat. And we have made a mess of it by spraying our crops and vegetables with deadly chemicals.I am proud of our farmers reaping a rich harvest, but they have to think of the land as well. Growing four crops a year with the help of chemicals may be profitable but has anyone considered what it is doing to our land? It is the same with our water. Every year, the water table dips further. Dont milk the land dry. Dont turn Punjab into a barren desert.I am also dismayed by the urban sprawl eating into our fields. What will happen to our eco system if we build houses everywhere? What will happen to our green fields ? We must stop this mindless building drive.I wish I could bring back the old times. I like the khulla-dulla, hara (open and green) Punjab with its warm neighbourhoods. I want a happy Punjab. A Punjab where farmers lead the nation with environmentally sustainable agriculture.

Every one wants the tilgul (a traditional sesame sweet) of power, but the BJP should be careful, the Sena said in the editorial.The Shiv Sena acknowledged that it was in seat-sharing talks with the BJP, and people have equated the process to the crushing of sugarcane. We feel that the crushing will yield more sweet than molasses, but as a ruling party there are several who have lined up at the BJPs footsteps to have a share of the tilgul.Both the Sena and BJP are preparing ground to contest independently in case the seat-sharing talks fail, and are already training their guns against each other ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.The Sena added, the BJP has never let go a single opportunity to criticise parties such as the Congress, the NCP, Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party, Lalu Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal, Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress and so on for harbouring people with criminal records.People think it is the BJP that can clean the murky Ganga of national politics, and the Modi-led party will cleanse the countrys political system. But such things are happening that make one wonder if the tilgul is a bite of sugar or stones that can break teeth, the Sena said.The party cited the recent induction of 91-year-old Narayan Dutt Tiwari from the Congress fold. Tiwari, a loyalist of the Gandhi family, has been the chief minister of two states, a Union minister and a Governor, though he had to resign after a sex scandal.The BJP should come clean as to how Tiwaris experience and guidance is going to exactly benefit the party, the Saamana editorial said.READ MOREBJP, Shiv Sena go on a poaching spreeBMC polls: Uddhav Thackeray mum on tie-up with BJP, announces sops"

After all, after the 2014 Assembly polls, the BJP and the Sena effectively control nearly two-thirds of the state through their elected legislators.More than the results of the municipal corporations or municipal councils that administer big cities and towns, the district council polls will indicate if the Congress and NCP bastions can be breached. At stake is more than 75% of the states rural population.The Congress-NCP have dominated rural politics as they control the agrarian economy through a network of sugar and credit co-operative societies and co-operative banks.The control of these co-operative structures gives the parties direct access to lakhs of farmers, who form their support base. Over the years, while the saffron parties have tried to make headway in these rural structures, the power has stayed squarely with the Congress and NCP.This time round, however, this status quo may change. And, if it does, the Opposition will find it difficult to make a comeback in the 2019 Assembly polls.Apart from local issues, the Centres demonetisation decision is also likely to have an impact, as the rural economy was hit worst by the cash crunch. Will this result in a vote against the BJP or only strengthen the Prime Minister? Can the Opposition leverage the issue to its advantage?The Congress is hopeful of covering lost ground.In the ZP polls, we will do well, as both demonetisation and the anti-farmer policies of the government will hurt the BJP. We expect a better show than in the municipal council polls, where we managed to come second and retain most of our seats. These elections, however, have to be seen from the prism of the 2014 polls, which give the BJP the advantage, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.The BJP concedes it will have a more difficult time in the Zilla Parishads, than in the municipal corporations.Our assessment is that like in municipal councils, we will vastly improve our tally in these polls and emerge as the number one party. We will do well in Zilla Parishads also, where we currently rank last. But here, our success may not be as big as in the cities. In the Zilla Parishad polls, local equations such as control of banks, sugar co-operatives and panchayat samitis matter. And, they (Opposition) have more of a presence in this network, admitted BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Going just by the results of just the 2012 polls in these 25 ZPs, the BJP has an uphill task.The party ranks last in terms of presence in these ZPs, with just 165 of the total 1,516 seats in its kitty. It has a lead only in Jalgaon and Jalna. In several ZPs, especially in Western Maharashtra, like Satara, Sangli and Solapur, the party has no presence.The NCP leads with 511 seats, in 10 ZPs and as such, has the most at stake in the upcoming rural bodies polls. The Congress too has a considerable presence (419 seats) and the partys challenge will be to maintain this advantage.The Sena ranks third with 233 seats. For both the main alliances, contesting these polls together may help. But, given the lack of trust between the Congress-NCP and BJP-Sena, such a tie-up may not work out across the state.A lot rides on these elections for all the four main political parties, and the mandate has not been so interesting for the state as a whole in a long time.Also readCongress, NCP to tie up for elections?Congress, NCP will go solo for BMC elections in 2017"

Its a habit she has developed over 25 years, living in the DDA flats that share boundary with the Badarpur Thermal Power Station (BTPS).Flyash is a big problem here. Youll see a layer of grey dust on everything even if you have swept and dusted just a few hours back, she said.The story has been the same for thousands of residents in Janta apartments, Molarband and Madanpur Khadar that surround the coal-based power plant. A number of people whom HT interviewed said this had been the best winter for them as the plant was shut in November and opened only this week.Living with noiseWe cant talk face-to-face as the noise from the boilers or steam generators overpowers everything. The sound is so loud that one cannot even hear the band playing at weddings in our colony, said HS Bhati, president of Badarpur Janta Houses Welfare Association.Read: Delhi pays huge price for power from pollution-heavy Badarpur plantAt any given time when the plant is in operation, the noise (Leq value) from BTPS fluctuates from 71 to 87 decibel, whereas, the permissible standard is 55 decibel during the day time and 45 decibel during the night.Sleeping becomes difficult because of the ear splitting noise. This happens whenever they run the turbines. Sometimes it would go on for 3-4 hours. Much has been talked about air pollution that the plant causes, but nobody seems to discuss the issue of noise pollution here, said DC Dey, a resident of the area.A living hell for plant workersRecalling the days he worked at the plant, AS Bisht (73) said, We would get coupons of Rs 200 or so at the end of each month to buy jaggery from Kendriya Bhandar located within the plant premises.As per Ayurveda, jaggery helps to cleanse the respiratory tracts, lungs, food pipe, stomach and intestines. But, doctors say the sweet made out of sugarcane can hardly improve the condition of workers who are directly exposed to over a hundred tonne of flyash and dust on a daily basis.Read: Delhis air quality still poor, Badarpur plant to remain shut for nowFlyash are particles that are either smaller or equal to 2.5 micrometers in their aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5). The smaller the particle suspended in the air, the greater the health risks.Tuberculosis (TB) was common among workers at Badarpur plant. We treated asthma and bronchitis like one would treat common cold. Many had developed complications in kidneys, Bisht added.Fly ash contains significant amounts of silica that can lodge in the lungs and cause silicosis, or scarring of the lung tissue, which can result in a disabling and sometimes fatal lung disease. Chronic exposure can result in fever, shortness of breath, loss of appetite and cyanosis (blue skin). In addition, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that silica causes lung cancer in humans.Over the years, the plant has become an under performer with three of its five units permanently shut. Since power generation from this plant has come down, NTPC is keeping only contractual workers for its basic operations. Hundreds of staff quarters inside the plant premises are lying vacant as very few are required to work when it is operational, said Sohan Singh, a contractor at BTPS.Problem of flyashWhen operational, the 705 MW plant produces a mammoth 3,500 metric tonnes of flyash every month, reports from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) indicate. This means about 117 metric tonnes of flyash, a key component of the hazardous PM 2.5 or fine particulate matter causing air pollution, is released from BTPS on a daily basis.The plant is spread across 2,160 acres of land within the national capital out of which 1,680 acres is used only to dump flyash which is a by-product of thermal electricity generation.DPCC reports accessed by HT revealed that as of 2016, the pond near the plant had a staggering 25.7 million metric tonnes of flyash dumped at any given point of time. This is equivalent to having as many as 81 Taj Mahals made out of fly ash.Murari Lal, a loco pilot with the Indian Railways who has been living near BTPS for 15 years, complained that clothes couldnt be dried outside as a thin layer of grey dust covers all of it.Not just that, most of us suffer bouts of coughing in the morning and black sputum comes out. I feel guilty for letting my children grow up in such an environment. Even relatives stopped visiting us. We just own one house and have no option but to live here, he said.Read: Breathless in Delhi | Check air quality at different areas in DelhiAccording to a report by IIT Kanpur, coal-based power plants operating in Delhi, which as of now is only the Badarpur one, are major contributors to the pollution load in Delhi. Coal-based plants alone have contributed 11% of the capitals PM 2.5 load.During summer months, coal and flyash contribute 26% of PM 2.5 and during winter months, secondary particles, including vehicular emissions and power plants, contribute 30% of PM 2.5.Fly ash also contains toxic metals such as arsenic, mercury, chromium including the highly carcinogenic chromium IV, lead, uranium and so on. It increases health risks from inhalation, can trigger immunological reactions, heart diseases and inflammation.Gaseous pollutantsWhats worse is that gaseous pollutants like nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur dioxde (SO2) that are also emitted from the plant were never accounted for in all these years.The national norms just did not have any prescribed limit stated for NOx and SO2 emissions whereas, studies as recent as the one by IIT Kanpur have stated that 52% of the Nitrogen Oxide (Nox) load of Delhi is being contributed by the power plants, Sunita Narain, director, Centre for Science and Environment and member of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA). It was only in December, 2015 that the Centre notified prescribed norms for the two dangerous pollutants.Breathless in Delhi, complete coverageEmission reports compiled by the state pollution control body reflect that while the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) which runs the plant has been able to keep particulate emissions within the permissible limit, it has not been able to curb its gaseous emissions.For example, SO2 emissions which cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a tight feeling around the chest has frequently been more than double of the permissible standard.NTPCs standThe NTPC, however, said that it is following all the norms prescribed by the government and denied its emissions have crossed the standards. As directed, we had shut operations of the entire plant owing to pollution. Besides, we have also installed pollution control devices at two units because of which particulate matter emissions have come down, said Deepna Mehta, NTPC spokesperson.On the issue of fly ash she said that in the last few years, the total ash utilisation of the plant has been 100%. The ash is being used in building the Delhi-Agra Highway and for ash-brick manufacturing, Mehta added."

According to forest department officials, several attempts were made by veterinarians from NGO Wildlife SOS and forest officials to reunite the lost cub with its mother, but the female leopard did not return to the site in search for her missing cub.The young cub was transferred to Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre, Junnar that houses 34 rescued leopards.Veterinarians from Wildlife SOS said the cub was weak and has been fed multivitamin supplements. We will have to hand-rear her as she cannot be returned to the wild, said Vinay Deshmukh, veterinarian.ReadCaught on reel: Leopard family reunion in Pune"

(Will you care for tea or water, sister?), asks a woman, hugging Baljinder and grasping her hands at Bhagi Vandar village, 6 km from Talwandi Sabo. She exchanges greetings, hops over a drain and rests her foot on a wooden log to tie the laces of her sneakers as supporters raise AAP flags and slogans.Facts Name: Baljinder KaurAge: 31Party: Aam Aadmi PartyEducation: MPhil (English)Role Model: Guru Granth Sahib (stresses on this)Poll quotient: Projecting herself as the only local among all the candidates in fray; insists she is a self-made politician.By the way: Avoids all types of sweets, even her tea is sugarless.Prior to joining politics, Baljinder was a lecturer of English at Mata Gujri College in Fatehgarh Sahib. I always wanted to do something for the cause of people, especially women. You can see women hardly get opportunities in politics as there is no levelplaying field, she says.She reaches Bhagi Vandar village at 1.30 pm after spending around more than three hours at the previous village, knocking on at every door she comes across. She enquires about the health of the elderly ontheway.She is accompanied by a strong army of nearly 100 young volunteers. The young volunteers, many of them still in school, distribute partys journal, AAP di Kranti (AAPs revolution), carrying a banner headline  Rajniti ch naviya paida uleek rahi hai Prof Baljinder Kaur (Prof Baljinder Kaur, charting a new course in politics).Samaa te kudrat bauht vaddi cheez hai, te badlaav kudrat daa hi roop hai (Time and nature are too big, and change is part of nature)Besides the rural voters, she understands the worth of about 18,000 votes each in Talwandi Sabo and Rama Madni towns, where she holds late-evening meetings daily, which at times stretch till midnight.For Baljinder, her rivals Jeet Mohinder Sidhu of the SAD and Khushbaaz Singh Jatana of the Congress are outsiders. I belong to Jaga Ram Tirath village in Talwandi Sabo. You enquire where do these two (Sidhu and Jatna) belong to? she says.THE ELECTORAL PASTThe electoral contest is not new to her, as she unsuccessfully contested the by-poll in 2014 from here, in which Jeet Mohinder Singh Sidhu ( who had resigned as the Congress MLA) of the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had won and she stood third.A by-election is most of the times won by a ruling party. The entire official machinery, the ministers, MLAs and the jathedars were spread across the village in the constituency, getting those works done, which were pending for years, she explains the reasons behind her earlier drubbing. I salute those 14,000 people who voted for me in the by-poll despite the tremendous pressure that the ruling party had mounted on the common people, she said.Baljinder is betting on the people, especially women, she says are with her, brushing aside the talks of influence of money and muscle power in polls. She talks about drug deaddiction and women empowerment, the areas she says will be her priority.GIVES GO-BY TO FATHERS LEANINGSBaljinder has given a go-by to her father Darshan Singhs legacy, who had leanings towards the Sikh radical elements. She makes it sure that her father liaison only within his close circles when it comes to seeking support for her.Of course, I do not follow blindly any ideology even if it is that of my father. That proves I have my own viewpoint in politics, which I find in consonant with the ideology of the AAP, Baljinder says.FRESH FACES IN THE FRAY: FIFTH OF 13 PART SERIESNEXT: DALVIR SINGH GOLDY"

This is shocking. (Arvind) Kejriwal ji PM ki degree ko chodo, zara mohalla clinics ke doctors ke bhi degree check karo (Kejriwal, forget the PMs degree, check the degrees of the doctors of mohalla clinics), read a tweet from the account of Pune-based Dr Majboor Gulati.Delhi governments health department officials, however, said that the report is most likely a fake one as there have been cases of forging reports in the past.I have not seen the report. However, a similar report had been doing the rounds on social media last year and we found that it had been forged using stationery from the labs, an official said, adding that labs have been asked to be careful about their stationery.Noting that the mohalla clinic system, which provides consultation, medicine and tests, has benefitted several people, the official said these messages are being spread to discredit the system.He also said that even if such a report a came from their labs, there is a doctor to check it. And, the doctor would never treat based on such a test report they would resend the samples.Last year, BJP MLA Vijender Gupta had questioned the quality of healthcare provided at mohalla clinics, citing the example of a pregnant woman who was diagnosed with thalassemia at one clinic and the report was allegedly incorrect according to a private lab.A D-10 haemoglobin electrophoresis by Bio-Rad, the accepted golden standard test, was performed for the woman and she was found to be carrying thalassemia trait, an official had informed HT.Carrying the trait does not mean that a person is suffering from thalassemia, but, if the husband also carries the gene, there are 25% chances that the baby suffers from the genetic blood defect, the official explained."
58feeed17be9e0429666b902,This doctor is first woman MLA from Ghaziabad in 32 years,http://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/this-doctor-is-first-woman-mla-from-ghaziabad-in-32-years/story-9spu0hbhswotmTZe9WLHZN.html,2017-03-19,"Service to others is nothing new for Dr Manju Shivach. She has been treating patients and performing surgeries for over 20 years till the voters decided that its time she donned a new role to serve the people  as the MLA of Modi Nagar in Ghaziabad.First-timer Dr Manju Shivach, who defeated two sitting MLAs in the 2017 UP assembly polls, became the first woman in 32 years to win an assembly seat in Ghaziabad district.The last woman to win from Ghaziabad was Congresss Vimla Singh who won the elections in 1985.Dr Shivach, a gynaecologist, was the only woman candidate to get a ticket from any major political party this elections. Although she was considered a non-entity by many, especially in the hinterlands of western Uttar Pradesh, she proved them wrong to claim the seat.Dr Shivach hails from a small non-political family from Dehradun. Her mother worked as school teacher and father as an accounts officer with UP Roadways.Her first political stint came in 2012 during the chairman election for Modi Nagar Nagar Palika seat which her husband, Dr Devendra Shivach, intended to contest but could not as the seat was reserved for women.Instead, she took up the challenge but lost. The couple had been classmates in medical college and decided to marry before settling in Modi Nagar from where her husband hails. They also set up a small hospital there in 1996.However, after the defeat in the nagar palika election, in 2013, she was entrusted to look after the womens wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party as its district president.There was no looking back since. Women joined me in large numbers and we joined every event, protest and agitation called by the party. It is hard for any woman to stand up in a male dominated region such as western UP. I remember carrying out publicity campaigns in the 2014 general elections for the party and drove through interior villages day and night. There were motorcades deployed by other parties to woo voters and they indulged in hectic campaigning. Still, it did not deter me, she said.During December and January, she stood in bus stops of Modi Nagar and urged people to join the BJP. Her ticket for the assembly seat was not confirmed till she came to the attention of party leaders.I remember that I had gone to partys regional office at Ghaziabad when the names of contesting candidates were being finalised. I was returning home and I had just reached Raj Chopla near my hospital and was on my phone. I lost the connectivity just then and could not figure out the names of the selected candidates and my heart was beating fast. When I reached Modi Nagar, people were celebrating outside my house and they told me that I will be contesting, she said.I could not believe it and I rushed back to the regional office for a confirmation. Since that day, I started preparations for the election. All my hospital work was taken over by my colleague Dr Shobhna Sengar. The networking part with leaders of dominant groups was taken over by my husband. These two people have been the driving force behind my success, Dr Shivach said.On March 11, the doctor was declared as winner from Modi Nagar seat after she trounced sitting BSP MLA from Murad Nagar Wahab Chaudhary and Rashtriya Lok Dals Sudesh Sharma, the sitting MLA from Modi Nagar seat. She was the only woman candidate among the nine who contested from the assembly seat.Her political duties aside, the doctor never misses her morning deadline to attend to patients who come from every section of society and far flung areas. Even after being elected the MLA, Dr Shivach is a regular at the hospital, attending to patients.She is a strict administrator and looks after the hospital personally. It is her personal touch with her patients that makes her respected and loved by all, Dr Sengar said.Her hobbies range from preparing Indian cuisines to reading literature and mythology. Even as she moves on to a bigger and challenging role, Dr Shivach says she will always be available to her patients and at the hospital.I had a lot of support wherever I worked. Even my patients supported me. Now, the time has come to take up a bigger challenge to serve people on a larger scale. I have a definite agenda to implement and take up issues of women security, sugarcane farmers and easing traffic related issues before the 2019 general elections. I will do all this at any cost, the new MLA said.Grill-session: Dr Manju Shivach, BJP MLA Modi NagarYou will be under pressure to perform before the 2019 general elections. What agenda will be your priority?My focus will be on reviving the industrial town of Modi Nagar, holding camps for the unemployed and seeing how they can be provided skills and jobs. Apart from this, I will also persuade all parents to compulsorily get their daughters admitted to schools. I will also try to bring Central schemes to my constituency.What other local issues you will take up?I will work to expedite payment of pending dues to sugarcane farmers who have been suffering for a long time. This is a major issue that has been delayed by local politics. I will also try to promote local craftsmen and revive the area as a textile hub. There will also be proper electrification in villages.It will also be on my agenda throughout to provide school and college-going girls better transport as they travel from far-flung areas. The party has already promised measures for safety and security of women and girls. Bypassing of traffic from Modi Nagar will also be a priority as the town in marred by heavy flow of vehicles.Several parties have held tampering with Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) responsible for their loss in the election. Your view?The EVMs are tried and tested and we have full faith in the Election Commission. Had there been any issue with the machines, there are several checks and balances to prevent malpractices. Also, the media would have raised the issue earlier. The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are trying to hide their loss behind EVMs. They cannot figure out why they lost, but it was more because of their caste-based and appeasement politics.Does your victory despite being a first-timer suggest dominance of polarisation this election?It is not about polarisation, but the works of PM Modi that have made people believe he will bring development. The people of UP were fed up with the rule of smaller parties who came to power one after the other. It was in fact a vote in support of PM Modi and his policies. People also supported demonetisation even though they had to stand in queues.I was confident of winning as I have been working on the ground for the past three years. People from all groups supported me. After my victory, a Muslim woman named Momina came to congratulate and gifted me a framed photograph of Lord Krishna.Representation of women has suffered as women MLAs have not been given due chance in the UP cabinet of late? What if you are given a chance as minister?Women have performed well and need due representation in the new cabinet. Representation of women will motivate other women to enter politics as well. They bring a more disciplined approach to politics. If I am given a chance, I will respect the partys choice and work honestly and with utmost transparency. Although I am new, I will learn this job as I learned to become a doctor with training."

Action including the closure of polluting industries will be initiated against those units found violating norms, said a ministry official.Approximately 500 million litres per day (MLD) of effluents are discharged daily into the Ganges. According to the ministry data, the municipal sewage generation from the 118 towns along the river in five states is estimated at 4,790 MLD. As against this, currently treatment capacity of 1,017 MLD is available.Cleaning up the Ganga 500 MLD*: Effluents discharged daily into the Ganges.4790 MLD: Municipal sewage generation from the 118 towns along the river in five states.1017 MLD: Current treatment capacity available.*MLD: million litres per dayA CPCB survey in the past has shown that over 52% of sewerage from small and mid-size towns along the Ganga goes untreated into the river.Among the industries that contribute to maximum untreated effluents are those manufacturing pulp and paper, sugar and chemicals. We have found that Ganga is most polluted between Kannauj and Kanpur. Some industrial units have put up common effluent treatment plants. But they are not enough. Many of the smaller units, to cut cost, have failed to install CETPs, a ministry official added.The ministry had earlier issued directions to five main industries -- distillery, sugar, pulp and paper, tannery and textile  that contribute 90% of inorganic load into the river system to achieve zero liquid discharge by March 2017.We will now check how many of them have complied, an official said."

This gives him a clear edge over his ministers as Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his election campaign in the state had expressed his resolve to uproot corruption if the BJP won the election. Rawats decision to keep that department (Suraj) would also deter the officials, especially the higher bureaucracy, his ministers and the party legislators from indulging in corruption of any kind while discharging their duties.The CM also managed to clip the wings of his main adversary and influential BJP leader from Kumaon Prakash Pant who too had been in the race for the post of chief minister. Rawat has given his rival peripheral departments ---legislative and parliamentary affairs, finance, language, sugarcane development and sugar industry, potable water and cleanliness. The only plum post that Pant has got is the department of excise. The chief minister, in comparison, seems to have elevated Satpal Maharaj, the senior most cabinet minister, by giving him the key portfolios such as tourism, pilgrimage, religious fairs, culture, besides Indo-Nepal and Uttarakhand river projects.A cursory glance at the list of portfolios also shows that most of the five Congress turncoats, including Maharaj, have got a better deal. For instance, Harak Singh has been assigned forest and wildlife, environment and solid waste management. Subodh Uniyal has been given agriculture, agriculture marketing, agriculture education, food processing, and horticulture. Rekha Arya, a minister of state (MoS), has been assigned the departments of women empowerment and child development, besides five other departments including animal husbandry.CM though did try to balance things by assigning higher education to the other minister of state (MoS), Dhan Singh Rawat, a BJP veteran. Dhan Singh has been assigned three other portfolios namely cooperatives, dairy development and protocol.Among other two BJP veteransArvind pandey and Madan Kaushik --- the latter has got a better deal in comparison as he has been assigned the departments of urban development, and housing among others. None of the five portfolios Pandey has been assigned --- school education, Sanskrit education, sports, youth welfare and panchyati raj --- is considered plum, according to political observers.Rawat govt sets up eco-tourism devp corpThe Uttarakhand government has constituted Eco-tourim Development Corporation. The conglomerate is mandated to carry out environmental conservation and create employment opportunities for the locals.Chief secretary S Ramaswamy presided over the first meeting of the corporation at the state secretariat, according to an official release. At the meeting officials decided that an action plan for eco-tourism development would be submitted to the government. In the next 15 days the corporation officials would select a pilot project to develop infrastructural facilities required for promotion of eco-tourism, the note read. Under the project, the activities like mountain climbing, wellness camps and home stay facilities etc would be promoted across the state."
