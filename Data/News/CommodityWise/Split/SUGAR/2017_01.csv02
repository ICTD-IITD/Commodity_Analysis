What about security issues? he told HT, quick to add with unease that he will give heed to the partys decision.There are others like him  ministers and MLAs  who dont want to come on record, but have expressed resentment about the decision taken in the first cabinet meeting of the Congress government on Saturday. An escort vehicle of Congress MLA from Gidderbaha Amrinder Sing Raja Warring carried a red beacon even after this decision.Also read | Punjab CM Amarinder, ministers remove red beaconsChief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had to issue a press statement on Tuesday, asking all MLAs to give up the frills. While the new government wants its ministers to shed VIP culture, Rana Gurjit Singh doesnt want to travel in anything but a Toyota Land Cruiser, even if he has to use one of his own private vehicles. I like to move in big cars, yet I am a kind-hearted man, he said.Rana, who owns sugar mills and other businesses, had even earlier told a television channel that he will not remove the red beacon from his official vehicle. He had declared assets worth 169 crore at the time of filing his nomination papers for the assembly elections.Also read | No VIP culture: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh bans red beacons on govt carsNew symbol of simplicityThe cabinet decision to remove red beacons is a paradigm shift in Punjab politics. Once a symbol of authority, it has now turned into a ploy to project simplicity. In fact, most parties ahead of the polls had promised to shed VIP culture. Even as the Aam Aadmi Party claims the move is inspired by it, the Congress has denied it.Amarinder Singh said on Tuesday that his government is committed to demolish VIP culture in the state, as mandated in the poll manifesto. Such VIP frills are a legacy of the pre-independence era and have no place in a democratic society like ours, the CM said in the statement, urging all his colleagues in the government and party and other elected representatives entitled to such privileges not to make it an issue of prestige.Also read | Batala ex-MLA Sekhri refuses to surrender official vehicleMost leaders have welcomed the decision and followed suit.

Its a cabinet decision to which I am a party and cannot refuse it, said health minister Brahm Mohindra, second in command in the Capt government.CS, CMO officers follow suitAll officers, of both Indian Administrative Services and Punjab Civil Services, posted in the chief ministers secretariat have removed the beacons from their vehicles. Deputy principal secretary to CM Amrit Kaur Gill, a PCS officer entitled to a blue beacon, said she removed it immediately after the cabinet decision. We are the face of the chief ministers office (CMO), so we must adhere to the CMs and cabinets orders, she said.Chief principal secretary to CM Suresh Kumar said all deputy commissioners and other administrative officers will also remove the beacons. IAS officers are entitled to an amber light.Police officers could use the beacon as per their entitlement. A policy is being prepared, and once its notified, there will be more clarity on the matter, he said."
58fef1297be9e0429666baca,There's room for everyone:&thinsp;How Mumbai's chawls have been housing people for 27 ...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/there-s-room-for-everyone-how-mumbai-s-chawls-have-been-housing-people-for-27-years/story-ISMyYhgY2BQZzDNTcpG1sI.html,2017-04-19,"Glen Martis, 45, was worried after his son, Alston, was diagnosed with acute anaemia. He, however, found solace in one thing. He knew if his son ever developed convulsions in his absence, his neighbours at Tambawala Trust building  a chawl at Dongri  would rush to his sons aid, arrange for help and would even wait at any hospital.Martis situation symbolises Mumbais chawl culture  where one floor of a multi-storied building comprises houses in a single row with a common verandah and toilets. Think of a joint family, but one in which its members are not related by blood. All residents, despite their small skirmishes, would celebrate festivals together and lend a helping hand to each other in times of crises.But all this is set to change, as chawls in the city have begun to give way to skyscrapers following government orders. Those who lived in cramped, 100-200-square feet houses for decades are to be shifted to 260-square feet apartments with toiletsFor Martis, it is a tough choice as he is worried whether one can retain the same kind of kinship he enjoys now. But then, with his building in a dilapidated state and the surrounding clamour for big houses, which offer both privacy as well as accommodate a growing family, shifting to a new place is imperative.When it all beganChawls were first built in 1900, when the then British government encouraged many traders to set up textile mills here. These mills needed labour and the workers  mostly from the coastal Konkan region  made a beeline for jobs here. In order to ensure houses for these labourers close to their mills, these dwellings were constructed in 100-200 square-feet areas by mill owners. Taking advantage of this situation, many landlords also constructed chawls as rent was a source of lucrative income for them. As Mumbai grew, the workers then started bringing their families to the city and lived with them in these chawls. The children were sent to municipal schools. Freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak started the Ganeshotsav festival from Keshavji Naik chawl in Girgaum with the whole aim of bringing people together. In the freedom movement, chawls played a vital role with many youngsters jumping into it.Rents in chawls range from Rs 50 to Rs 200 a month. (Illustration by Shrikrishna Patkar)The chawl cultureThese chawls had a large verandah as well as a big ground where children could play. In the night, adults would take a stroll in the compound, which also served as a meeting point for the residents. In these chawls, various festivals like Ganpati, Dahi Handi and Diwali were celebrated with gusto. In case of weddings and functions, as people could not afford halls, a pandal used to be erected at the ground and the whole function used to take place there. In case of a celebration at someones house, all the women in the chawls would come together and cook for the guests. The exchange of commodities like sugar, milk and other eatables is commonplace in these chawls. The chawl culture also played its role in Marathi literature and theatre. The workers theatre also gifted a number of playwrights and actors to Marathi theatre. The chawl culture has been portrayed in the works of several Marathi litterateurs like P L Deshpande. Socialist and leftist parties also got tremendous support from the tenants of these chawls for a few decades since the 1940s and 50s.The story of Mumbais multi-storey chawls Chawls are rows of rooms with a huge verandah in front. A chawl consists of two to four storeys with at least 40 roomsA typical room, popularly called kholi, is a 100-sq ft to 200-sq ft area and comprises a hall and kitchenRents in chawls range from Rs 50 to Rs 200 a monthChawls go back to British rule when traders set up textile mills in Mumbai and hired workersTo house these workers close to textile mills, these humble dwellings were constructedThe textile boom and dipMost chawl dwellers worked in the textile mills. Many of them also managed to get their children jobs in these mills once they grew up. The Shiv Sena, which was started in 1966, was able to attract youths from these chawls. Top leaders like Manohar Joshi, Vithal Chavan, Dattaji Nalawade, Wamanrao Mahadik and Suryakant Desai all trace their origins to these chawls. But, in January 18, 1982, the entire textile sector went on strike, which proved to be a death knell and the strikes direct effect was borne by chawls. As the strike lingered on, many mill workers sold their houses and returned to their villages or went to the distant suburbs. Many unemployed youths began to get attracted to the underworld. Chawls like Dagdi Chawl at Byculla and 144 tenements at Chinchpokli gained notoriety as it became a recruitment place for gangstersAt presentCurrently, chawls pose to be lucrative real-estate for builders. From the governments point of view, chawls offer a great opportunity to offer affordable houses after rehabilitating the existing tenants. The BDD chawls spread across 92.86 acres in prime areas like Lower Parel, Worli, Naigaon and Sewri promises to be a well-designed township with all modern amenities for its residents. Next on the block are the 133 Bombay Improvement Trust (BIT) chawls  located in prime areas such as Mumbai Central, Agripada, Sion, Parel and Mazgaon  another potential goldmine in the space-starved city. Apart from these are the chawls owned by textile mills, which are also set to be redeveloped. The chawls owned by landlords are also on the revamp radar, but now the recession in the real-estate market has slowed down the entire process. For how long the remaining chawls will survive is anybodys guess.What does Mumbai mean to you? Over the next few weeks, we are celebrating our favourite things about the city? We will trace the roots of Mumbais most popular street foods, drop in at its maidans, explore the workings of its stock markets and that grand dream machine that is Bollywood.

No member of his family was injured, Jorge Morales, executive secretary of the State Commission for the Care and Protection of Journalists, told AFP. That group was created in 2012 after nine Veracruz journalists were murdered within months.Monlui was the editor of a local business newspaper, El Politico, and wrote a column covering area politics and the sugar cane industry.A source close to the local prosecutors office said that Monlui and his family had been invited to breakfast at a popular restaurant in the town of Yanga. As they were walking back to their car, another car pulled up and at least two gunmen opened fire, leaving Monluis body sprawled on the asphalt, the source said, speaking on grounds of anonymity.The Reporters Without Borders group reported in February that Mexico is now the most dangerous country in Latin America for journalists to work in, with 99 of them murdered from 2000 to 2016. The Veracruz area, with 19 journalists killed, was called the most hazardous.The last Mexican newsman to be killed was Cecilio Pineda, shot dead this month in Guerrero state as he lay resting in a hammock.In other violence in Veracruz, five police officers and three civilians died in a firefight with gunmen hunting for the mayor of a town where mass graves holding hundreds of bodies have been found, police said.str-jg/jb/bbk"

Singh had joined the BJP just before the UP elections, before that he had been with the Congress for around 30 years. It was on his bike that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had ridden pillion to visit the village of Bhatta Parsaul during the farmers agitation there some years ago.As BJP candidate, Singh has defeated Bhati who had been winning the Jewar seat for the last three elections.Many attribute his victory to more than just the Modi wave. It was his reach among different communities in the constituency  be it Jatav, upper castes, Muslims or Gujjars  that led to his victory.Read more: Backed by Muslims, BJPs Dhirendra Singh defeats three-time BSP MLA in JewarPost his win, Singh intends to focus on his poll promises that include construction of an airport in Jewar, setting up of a womens college and reopening of the areas closed mills.For the last 40 years, the sugar mills in Jewar have remained shut due to various reasons. Successive state governments have not changed the conditions of the mill. Now, Singh says he wants to revive them from the ground level.For far too long, the people of Jewar have suffered due to the unavailability of mills. I promise them that the BJP government will revive the sugar mills and factories to ensure job opportunities for the workers, the first-time MLA said.He also believes his poll promise of construction of an airport at Jewar will contribute towards providing employment opportunities to the areas young voters.Tourism will increase with the construction of an airport. More and more job opportunities will be created with construction of hotels and restaurants near the airport, he said.In an election rally in Rabupura last month, Union home minister Rajnath Singh too had reiterated Singhs claims. He had also said that the permission to construct the airport has been approved by his ministry.Singh has also promised to set up a degree college for women, the lack of which has ensured that higher education remains out of reach for many young women in his constituency.Earlier, our sisters and daughters had to travel outside Jewar to pursue higher education. Many did not attend college because of this reason. The situation will improve once a college is set up for them, he said."

But the government was firm. It said such a step would lead to a fiscal collapse and not benefit farmers.Mungantiwar said of the 1.36 crore farmers, 1.07 are indebted, 67 lakh of them hold less than 1 hectare of farmland. To strengthen their financial condition, developing agricultural infrastructure is key, not a waiver. For this, the budget earmarked Rs 8,233 crore for pending irrigation projects; Rs2,812 crore for completion of 26 shortlisted projects nearing completion under PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana. To give a boost to the long-pending Krishna Marathwada project, the state made a separate Rs250 crore allocation, keeping it outside the governor formula. The project will irrigate 33,945 hectares in drought-prone Osmanabad and Beed and provide drinking water to 288 villages. NCP leader and former finance minister Jayant Patil, like many others in Opposition, criticised the states decision. The state talks of allocation over and above the what was done as per guidelines of the Governor, but figures show it couldnt even release funds allocated for irrigation projects.Mungantiwar said the governments focus is on doubling agriculture income over the next four years by increasing production and productivity. The budgets allocations show the states focussing on irrigation, electricity, food processing, technology, and to push for direct marketing of produce. The budget allocated Rs 979.10 crore for electrification of agicultural pumps in east Vidarbha. Tax on buying sugar cane imposed on sugar factories was waived to enable them to pay fair prices to farmers. This will cause a burden on the state exchequer for 2015-16 and 2016-17 of Rs700 crore. To encourage use of milk testing to curb adulteration, the state removed VAT of 13.5% on these kits.On farm loans, CM Devendra Fadnavis said the Centre was positive about institutionalising the credit system and the state will bear its share. The three-tier system will let farmers take fresh loans even if they are defaulters as the institutions providing loans are governed by RBI.Experts are not confident about the provisions. I dont think any of these schemes will directly benefit farmers. Take the farm pond scheme. The staten provides Rs 50,000 to farmers but it costs more than Rs1 lakh. Sugarcane tax waiver will benefit the factories, said SS Magar, former vice chancellor, Konkan agriculture university.Read: Maha budget 2017-18: Heres what Mumbai gotFocus is on making farming sustainable: Maharashtra finance ministerOppn burns Maharashtra budget, Shiv Sena stays calm"

Of the various idiosyncrasies our families have with their eating habits. Well, my immediate and extended family is definitely blessed with these crazy virtues, at times even freaking out the servers at restaurants, cafes and coffee shops.Have you ever heard about a warm cold coffee? I am sure you havent because a warm cold coffee is a cold coffee, which is microwaved for 10 seconds. Thats what my younger brother orders, sending almost every waiter into a tizzy, unless of course the waiter has a younger sibling with similar demands.This is just the tip of the iceberg. How about plain cornflakes, with sliced banana? And, of course, no milk with it. Thats my favourite these days, a recipe I invented on the Kalka-Delhi Shatabadi. Bhaji, eh dudh vi dindey ney (they also provide milk), said my co-passenger a tad upset with a Singh not drinking milk. And moreover, I wasnt even doing paisa vasooli because the butter cube was also lying idle.Sir, I also eat porridge without milk. I boil it in water, I replied. But yes, my fathers Mamaji (maternal uncle) is a great milk fan. A professor emeritus at the Panjab University, he drinks a glass of milk with Papaya chunks in it, I added. That my co-passenger had got a new fruity milk recipe was clearly visible when he finally started focusing on his breakfast. I knew I had built his appetite.Pity that he backed off soon because what I failed to tell him was my love for caramel custard with chicken curry. Since I dont have a sweet tooth and I love caramel custard, the only way I can savour it to maintain the right balance is either with chicken curry or dal. For your kind information, I dont add sugar to my coffee or tea to make it sweet. I add a bit of sugar just to remove the phikka (bland) taste. Ask the Sector-11 coffee shop folks and theyll explain exactly what I mean by removing the phikka. In other words, the sweet dish in our house is virtually sweetless and food saltless.Im glad my wife is not around while Im writing this column. Otherwise she would have cringed and complained about how I prefer cakes without oil and butter. She refuses to commit such sacrilege, a great baker that she is. She also hates my idea of cooking a rajma-chawal biryani, nor does she approve of us serving air-fried (in an air fryer) okra, aubergine, zucchini and long gourd to our guests. This is torturing them, she says.It seems that I had let off my brother easily because joining me as I write this column is my son. I have seen chacha eating a bhartha (aubergine mash) sandwich. Yuck, he says, without realising that he has given his dad a new sandwich idea other than jam toast stuffed with fried egg. No, wonder this teenager refuses to go out with me to diners or restaurants. Dad, who orders a lamb cheese burger without cheese? is a question he consistently asks me whenever I have the privilege of his company. And you ruin the spicy chicken burger by asking them to serve it without mayonnaise. Yuck, he says again, after which I narrate him an incident at a fast food joint in Denver, America, when I asked for a double whopper in plain buns without cheese and mayonnaise.You aint got anything in it. Just take it free, replied the Hispanic sales girl, apparently disgusted with my order. Punjab goes to the polls on February 4. Please dont make a hash of it like the chicken khichdi that I love. Vote decisively for a better and tasteful Punjab.(nsinghkhushwant@hotmail.com)"

Head of political department, CCS University, Prof Sanjeev Sharma says, Voters in west UP talks about many issues including development, employment and plights of farmers but at last majority of them prefer to vote on the basis of caste and religion. BSP candidate in Meerut city constituency, Pankaj Jolly, also admits that Quotients of caste and religion had always affected election in western UP.Labourer Momin, his friends Shaan Mohammad and Bhura of Visthapit colony in village Palra, Muzaffarnagar, also speaks about development and declares his affiliation for Akhilesh Yadav. But this is not the sole reason of giving their votes to Akhilesh. When prodded further, they reply in unison, We like him because he and his party takes care of Muslims. In neighbouring district Meerut, Thakur Harkishan of village Kapsad supports BJP MLA Sangeet Som and his party because he and other villagers believe Hindus too need patronage. Anil Dalit in village Abdullapur of Meerut says, Dalits are dedicated to behanji (Mayawati) because she has given a new identity to the entire clan. He says development and employment are essential but protection of the entire clan and identity equally matters for us.These equations also reflect in election strategies of political parties. BJP is banking on combination of non- Yadav OBC( Kurmi, Kashyap, Lodh, Gurjar, Saini and others) with upper castes( Brahmin, Thakur, Vaishya etc) and its rival BSP is working to forge a bond between its cadre dalit votes with Muslims and the party has fielded 36 Muslim candidates to attract minority voters. On the other hand SP-BSP alliance is confident of their victory by combining votes of Muslims, Yadav and upper caste voters. It is believed that SP did not ally with RLD because the party did not want to take the risk of annoying Muslim voters, who largely believe that Jats were responsible for Muzaffarnagar riot in 2013. The RLD is also depending on its base Jat voters for success in this election and it may play spoilsport for other parties.Read more: 75 Aligarh villages left in the darkOn the other hand, parties also have given tickets to 12 turncoats in the fray and experts say that the motive behind it was to attract voters of their clan. They feel, it would help parties and candidates to consolidate voters on the basis of castes and religion.Interestingly, in this elections political parties are out to woo women candidates who form approximately 45 per cent of the total votes in western UP. BJP and RLD each has fielded 8 women candidates, Samajwadi Party has given tickets to 6 women, BSP has fielded 3 women candidates and Congress has given ticket to 2 women candidates.In the previous assembly election of 2012, BJP won 12 seats, BSP 22, SP 28, Congress 7, RLD 3 and others 1 on 71 seats of the region. Later, in the by-election the ruling SP registered victory on Kairana, Bijnor and Thakurdwara seas while it lost the Muzaffarnagar seat.Read more: Muslims hold the key in West UP"

Requests have been pouring in over the last few years, said Ashok Das, Joint Secretary, Latin America and the Caribbean.Das told DH on the sidelines of the discussion on Connecting Contemporary India to Diaspora in Girmitiya countries: Link to Past for a Shared Future, the maximum demand is from Mauritius, Suriname and Fiji. We are working together on this and the ministry has also created a special section and library to trace and compile records. Mauritius has taken the lead is this, he said.Prithvirajsin Roopun, Minister for Culture and Arts and Social Integration and Economic Empowerment, Mauritius, said that there was also a need for all Girmitiya countries to collaborate and not to look for support from India alone.In Mauritius, we have found and digitally preserved records of the first Indian labourers who were brought to the country. The same records should be maintained In Delhi too, he said.He also added that there was a need to preserve Indian sites and Indian literature in other countries. He requested Indians do donate books to libraries in Mauritius and to the Ministry of External Affairs so that more information can be disseminated.Minister of State for External Affairs Gen V K Singh said the ministry had received many requests from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, where Indians living there wanted to trace their roots. According to the ministrys research programme, we are finding records and whatever is a part of the database is also being shared with them, he said.Members of Girmitiya countries pointed out that they were keen on teaching the younger generation more Indian languages and not just Sanskrit and Hindi.The first pravasisRoopun explained that among the many pravasis, the first ones were those in Girmitiya countries. Around 130 to 140 years ago, 38 Indians from Chota Nagpur were shipped to Mauritius from Calcutta to work in sugar fields, by the British. Later, as a part of the exchange slave trade, from Mauritius, they were sent to other countries including South Africa, Fiji and Vietnam. The place where the first batch of Indians landed at Aapravasi Ghat, today is recognised as a World Heritage site."

Film producer Dr Satish Rai, a Girmitiya with roots in Uttar Pradesh, is all set to make a movie on the subject.This first-of-its-kind film, titled Awaaz  the Girmit Conspiracy, has already received clearance from the UP government.Rai is a Sydney-based film producer, academician, politician and community development worker who has been holding talks with the UP government on issues concerning Girmitiyas. It was in 2015, during the first ever Pravasi Diwas organised by the state government that the idea to shoot a movie on the subject first came to me, he said.A big chunk of the film will be shot in UP, the worst-affected state during the dreadful indenture system (1828 to 1916), under which millions of Indians were herded off to British colonies to work as bonded labourers in cane plantations - the most profitable business of those times.Rai said the movie will primarily focus on the movements that were launched to abolish the indenture system - a form of slavery. This film will cover the epic story of the international struggles that were launched to abolish the dreadful system of labour trafficking. It will largely focus on the battle to bring back thousands of stranded indentured Indians in Fiji and the international conspiracy to prevent them from returning to their homes so that theyd continue working as cheap labour in Fiji, he said.SLAVERY AS INDENTURE SYSTEMAfter the British Slavery Abolition Act came into force, eliminating slavery throughout the empire, a new avatar of the malpractice was introduced in the form of the indenture system. It was a sort of debt bondage in which around 1.2 million Indians were deported to Fiji to work in cane farms. The majority of these people were from UP - from places like Gonda, Basti, Faizabad, Sultanpur, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Rae Bareli and other districts, said Rai, who is also an active member of the International Girmit Association.While the movie will be a work of fiction, it will be based on historical research and will features characters of internationally renowned public figures such as Pt Totaram Sanadhya, Kunti, Mahatma Gandhi, Annie Besant, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Sarojini Naidu, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Winston Churchill, Edward Knox and Thomas Hughes. Pt Totaram Sanadhya and Kunti were two indentured Indians in Fiji who returned in 1914 to join the abolition movement and be at the forefront of the struggle, said Rai.The shooting will start after the UP assembly election. At present, I am shooting another film  Vijaypath - a road to victory, he added.Rais grandparents were deported from Faizabad to Fiji with their two young sons in 1911. The film producer said that he struggled for almost a decade before he managed to trace a kin of his in UP in 2004. I finally found my grandparents cousin who lives in Sridutt Ganj in Balrampur district with his four sons, he said."
58fef7497be9e0429666bfbf,Modi's 'achhe din' reality check: Pressure builds to deliver on election promise,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-are-the-achhe-din-ask-those-who-voted-for-modi/story-zSkharcZSfHdLRtDtwd5UJ.html,2017-02-05,"Rocking the youngest of his five children in his arms, street vendor Daata Ram watches his wife tend to two sick cows whose milk once supplemented their meagre income.The 66-year-olds family of seven survives on what he now makes by selling small quantities of puffed rice in Pandra Sikanpur, a one-street, hardscrabble town of 5,000 in Uttar Pradesh.I took a loan of Rs 30,000 to buy those cows but I think they are no good now, says Ram, who uses a fourth of his monthly earnings of Rs5000-6000 to repay the local moneylender.Across the street from Rams thatched hut is the sprawling house of Neeraj Kumar Singh, a well-off sugarcane farmer who lost multiple crops to back-to-back droughts three years ago, and then suffered when farm prices crashed last year.It takes two harvesting seasons to recover the loss of one, says Singh who wants his sons to find jobs outside farming so that their lives wouldnt be held ransom to the vagaries of nature.But his four children have found no jobs, and the 60-year-old farmer is angry that he must now divide his 10 acres of cropland to secure their future.Daata Ram and Singh sit on different points on the countrys income spectrum but, in their collective discontent, the two symbolise the rising pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliver on his emotive election vow to bring achhe din, or good times, to Indians.The Feb. 1 budget was a chance for Modi to unveil measures that would fulfil his 2014 guarantee of growth and more jobs, a task made all the more tough by his abrupt decision to drain out 86% of all cash in the economy in his fight against illicit wealth.Its also a challenge that is urgent, given that Modi has already crossed the halfway point of his tenure.Read | Budget 2017: Akhilesh says BJP could not fulfil promise of achhe dinTo his admirers, though, Modi has already made great strides  from reinvigorating the ossified hand of a government system that hobbled progress to biting the bullet on tough decisions needed to pull Indias economy out of a dangerous morass.Many of his moves on inclusive, accountable governance and a freer hand to bureaucracy have resonated well with Indians tired of a rudderless government mired in corruption scandals and whose indecisiveness had left more than 700 major industry projects in limbo.Rambir Rathi , a Uttar Pradesh farmer at home (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)Growing economySome of that good work is showing.The countrys annualised retail inflation is below the mid-point of the central banks target; public finances are better than before with higher income from taxes, monsoon-sown grain production is the highest in at least 14 years and the economy is more open to business than it has ever been. In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much. I dont feel like giving him even one), he says, adding Modi had only done well on dealing with Pakistan.But farms in distressWith mounting debt, poverty, increasing health cost and other ballooning farming-related expenses, farm incomes dropped 50%-70% over the past years. And just farmers hoped to claw back from two years of back-to-back drought, the government ordered a disruptive currency ban that squeezed the largely cash-only agriculture sector.Farm prices crashed as farmers dumped tomatoes and potatoes onto the streets, fed unharvested crop to cattle and farm hands sat idle. A farm loan write-off for two months after demonetisation hardly helped, some economists say.Februarys budget raised the farm credit target to by 11.1% to Rs 10-lakh crore in 2017-18 but, in reality, bank lending to farmers has dropped and the distribution of credit has focussed on a handful of relatively better-off states.Expenditure on agriculture is seen rising marginally to Rs 2.06-lakh crore in 2017/18, but this in real terms might signal a decline.Fewer jobsSigns of distress are clear in cities as well. Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Modis popularity among the relatively well-off.Today, India stands before a unique moment in history: It could choose to squander its immense potential with its antiquated socio-political system, corruption and flighty business rules or build on its cultural heritage, democratic values and a young demography to transform the lives of its 1.25 billion citizens.To begin with, two decades on, nothing less than a $10 trillion economy will secure Indias future, says a recent study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers( PwC). It will have to create jobs on a scale that can absorb 10-12 million people who join the workforce every year, including members of the emerging middle class  a billion strong by 2034.Read | Achhe din will come only after 2019, Cong working on it: Rahul GandhiBut only 135,000 jobs were created in 2015 -- the lowest total in seven years and 67% lower than the number created in the last year of the previous government. In one quarter of 2016-17, for which official data is available, only 77,000 jobs were created  and of these 50,000 were government jobs.The gloom is affecting the youth.Chartered accountant Omprakash Sethia in Bhopal. (Mujeeb Faruqui/HT PHOTO)Nothing has changed. It seems there is nobody to follow Modijis principles of hard work and integrity. Corruption is rampant . It seems there is no monitoring system in the country. I am hugely disappointed, says Omprakash Sethia of Bhopal.I thought there would be a boom on the job front but despite emphasis on digital India I dont see many job avenues, says Subhanshu Sethia, a commerce student in Bhopal.The demonetisation move worsened the plight of the vulnerably placed in the labour market in several ways, the most stress arising out of closure of establishments in the informal sector.Back in Pandra Sikanpur, Singh says he will think twice about voting for Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the next general elections scheduled for 2019.That view is far from universal, but is already on the radar of a government, which swept to power with promises of economic reforms and pro-business policies that appealed to aspirational Indians living in big towns and cities.Modi has already started turning his attention to the hinterlands. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this month said the government will spend a record amount on rural areas and farming to help double farmers income by 2022.But Singh is unimpressed.Narendra Modi stressed on jobs during his speeches in general election. Where are those jobs? he asks.I know how I feel is how many many more Indians feel.(With inputs from Ranjan Srivastava and Sumanta Ray Chaudhuri)"

He alleged that an alliance between the two will give rise to more corruption.Shah led an attack on the construction of the Agra-Lucknow Expressway developed by the SP government. He said that highways being constructed by the Central government cost nearly 18 crore per kilometre, while the Agra-Lucknow Expressway cost nearly 31 crore per kilometre.I want to ask Akhilesh where 13 crore went... whether it went to the uncle or the nephew. During the 10-year rule of the Congress, many scams came to light. Now, the Congress has come together with Akhilesh. There is something called law and order. But in UP, there is lo and order karo (take and give orders, alleging corruption), he said.He claimed that one party looted the nation while the other looted the state. He also questioned the SP about the development that it took after the Central Government sent nearly 2.5 lakh crore to the state.Shah was in the textile hub in Pilkhuwa and arrived in support of former MP Dr RC Tomar who is contesting from the Dhaulana assembly segment and pitted against SPs sitting MLA Dharmesh Tomar.During the last 15 years, the state has also suffered on account of the repeated governments of the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party. If you got to the BJP-ruled states, you will see the development for yourself but your state has lagged behind. I have been roaming around in UP for six months now, and there is a similar Modi wave in UP like there was in the 2014 elections, he said.He also attacked the law and order situation in the state and cited the example of killing of policemen in violent incidents at Jawahar Bagh in Mathura in June last year.Once, the BJP comes to power, we will get all illegally occupied land freed up from mafia within 15 days. We will get the pending payment of sugarcane farmers done within a time frame. I have come to know that there is pending payment to be made to farmers in Dhaulana , amounting to nearly 200 crore. The first thing we will do is get all the mechanical slaughter houses closed down if we come to power, he added.He also cited an incident where the bull of a farmer was taken away by people who indulged in cattle slaughter. Dhaulana is primarily a Hindu dominated locality and comprises villages of Thakurs. Its borders are shared by Gautam Budh Nagars Dadri which saw the lynching of 55-year-old Mohammad Ikhlaq in September 2015.Shah also said that BJP government, if it comes to power, will check the issue of migration of (Hindu) families like the one allegedly that took place in the Kairana town of Shamli district last year.Earlier in the day, Shah had cancelled his Padyatra in Western UPs Meerut district to protest the murder of a city trader who was shot dead by robbers a day ago. In Meerut, he also attacked the worsening law and order situation in the state."

He also made a reference to slaughterhouses, in a joke, juxtaposing it with a specific caste.An aggrieved elderly citizen belonging to the Jat community once visited our office to register his complaint. He told me that one morning, while he was carrying his sugarcanes in a bullock cart to the nearby market for sale, he stopped mid-way to buy guavas. When he came back with the guavas, his bull was missing. I told him to register a complaint with the police because the UP police was already tracking Azam Khans lost buffaloes. But then he revealed that his bull was stolen by the slaughterhouse people, Shah said.As the crowd cheered to his dog-whistle narrative, Shah announced that the BJP, when it is voted to power, will come down on slaughterhouses from Day 1. When BJP comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, we will ban all unregulated slaughterhouses on Day 1, Shah said.Shahs speech also evoked the Dadri lynching incident, in which an unruly mob had lynched a Muslim man to his death, over allegations of cow slaughter. Bisada, the village where the incident took place, is located around 20km from Noida.In 2016, several incidents were reported across the Hindi heartland, in which cow vigilantes had beaten up meat transporters. The Bisada lynching and the cow vigilantism had attracted nationwide attention and saw BJP on the back foot as the party, including the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had earlier campaigned heavily against bovine slaughter.Even in 2014, during the Lok Sabha elections, party president Amit Shah and BJP leaders Sangeet Som and Sanjeev Balyan had faced criticism for their inflammatory speeches in western UP belt, in the wake of the Muzaffarnagar riots. Around 60 people were killed in the riots and thousands have been displaced.Shah also attacked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav saying that he asks for the caste and religion of the people before giving them free laptops. He said that only his party will not discriminate people on their caste or religion.Akhilesh Yadav promised free laptops to the youth of UP but have the Noida youth received any? It is because Yadav asks for your caste and religion before handing out laptops. We will never ask your caste before giving free laptops, Shah said.In his thirty-minute speech, Shah discussed issues ranging from the development of the state, job creation for youth to cow slaughter and anti-Romeo squads to safeguard women.We will ensure that our girls are safe in the state from the Samajwadi Party goons. Every police station will have anti-Romeo squads, which will hang these SP goons upside down and teach them a lesson, Shah said."

After staying for nearly 30 years in Congress, Maharaj quit it in March 2014 and embraced BJP alleging that he was not given his due for the services rendered. He is now contesting his first election as BJP candidate as Hindustan Times catches up with him on the campaign trail in Chaubattakhal assembly constituency.His day starts with 45-minutes of meditation followed by a review of the work done till last night. He then checks out the days plan while leafing through newspapers and passing instructions to his team on how not to fall foul of the Election Commission.He spares 15 minutes for breakfast  dhokla, chutney and sugar free tea --- before leaving his office-cum-residence at Satpuli few minutes past 10 am to address the first election meeting of the day at Thanikhal village, 25 kms away.People have stopped farming in many parts of Chaubattakhal owing to destruction caused by wild animals and small land holdings, Maharaj tells HT. Agricultural land needs to be rejuvenated and better utilised, which is possible only after proper land consolidation. It will also help increase the farmland size in hill areas and check migration.As he reaches Thanikhal around 12.30 pm, he is welcomed by the local BJP workers with traditional Garhwali folk bands. He moves to a canopy raised nearby where locals from from nearby villages have gathered. Maharaj assures the villagers of creating new walnut and pomegranate orchards and introducing herbal farming after proper testing of soil. In his 25-minute speech, Maharaj talks of early completion of drinking water schemes and providing employment to locals via promotion of homestays for tourists. He also takes a dig at chief minister Harish Rawat over his saviour of Uttarakhand video that has gone viral.He then starts for Satpuli. On way, he stops at Ganikhal market and meets local shopkeepers requesting them to support BJP. Back in his SUV, he points towards the high tension transmission line running parallel to mountains. These can be hazardous for flying machines like helicopter and must be marked with coloured flags for identification. he says.He takes lunch at Satpuli and 30 minutes later sets off for another meeting at Kandakhal village on way to Lansdowne cantonment. Maharaj repeats the promises he made at Thanikhal but here his focus is mainly on checking migration. Our main effort will be to check migration from this area by providing employment generating entrepreneurship skills to the youths and assuring them minimum earning, says Maharaj.He also questions Congresss alliance with Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh saying the ruling party in the neighbouring state was responsible for unleashing atrocities on women who agitated for separate Uttarakhand. Harish Rawat who talks and swears by the hills, was scared to contest from hill constituency, he adds.Maharaj then leaves for another public meeting at Peeda village ahead of Kandahal, yet another area bearing the brunt of migration where population has come down by nearly 80% in the last 25 years. At Peeda, apart from land consolidation, migration and other local issues, Maharajs speech is focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and how demonetisation has reduced stone pelting at security forces in Jammu and Kashmir in addition to having demoralised the naxalites. We will make efforts to create, Shakya, Shaiva and Vishnu circuits as important religious tourist zones in the state if voted to power, says Maharaj ending the speech with appeal for pressing the lotus button.He joins local BJP workers for tea before leaving for party office at Satpuli as the sun sets in."

A security person stands alert by a helicopter at GCT helipad in cantonment area. He smiles at this correspondent. CM sahab to neta hain, der ho he jati hai (CM is a political leader and delays are bound to happen).With next 10 minutes, chief minister Harish Rawat arrives, with staff and Congress poll managers, over two hours late from his scheduled departure. He goes through the days appointments and instructs leaders on what to share with media over the next two days.As the chopper takes off, Rawats son Virendra serves brunch  cabbage sabzi, chapatti and dahi. This food will drive CM for another 12 hours. I prefer simple food. Always on the move, I dont get time to eat, says Rawat.The Congress poster boyRawat is the Congress poster boy and is single-handedly managing partys campaign. Its a do or die battle for the 69-year-old who managed top save his government even as nine party MLAs rebelled against him last March. His days programme is fixed for Udham Singh Nagar district that has nine assembly seats. Rawat is contesting from two seats, including Kichha in Udham Singh Nagar. BJP has fielded Congress turncoats at two seats  Jaspur and Bajpur.Chief Minister Harish Rawat campaigns with local candidate Manoj Joshi in Kashipur . (Anupam Trivedi/ HT Photo)At Jaspur, the crowd goes berserk. BJP ko sabak sikha kar hi dam lenge sahab (well teach the BJP a lesson), they shout as the chopper lands. Having an experience of five decades in active politics, CM senses the public mood. He takes position atop an SUV and starts the roadshow, waving hands, and accepting sweets and garlands while moving through the narrow lanes of Jaspur, which has 1.3 lakh voters including 32,000 Muslims and 18,000 Chauhans.BJP thought we have gone bankrupt (after three-time local MLA joined the saffron party), says Rawat. He is hopeful that political greenhorn Adesh Chauhan has a good chance in this constituency, bordering Uttar Pradesh.The next stopover is Kashipur. In 2012 polls, a rebel had eaten into the Congress votes here, but this time it is the BJP that is facing the problem with its former MLA Rajeev Agarwal contesting as an independent. The constituency has a mix of Muslim, Kumaoni and Sikh voters. Congresss Manoj Joshi had lost last polls by 2,200 votes. He is again in the fray. Manoj lag jao, ye tempo banaye rakho (maintain the tempo), CM instructs.Rawat spends maximum time in Bajpur. BJP has fielded Congress turncoat Yashpal Arya from the seat.As Rawat speaks, Harvinder Singh, a Sikh farmer listens patiently. He nods his head when CM says, Bhajpa wale Congress mein sahara dhoond rahe hain (BJP is looking for support from Congress leaders).Bajpur, an SC reserved seat, is traditionally a Congress stronghold. Harvinder says he will stick with Congress. Rais Ahmad, a Muslim labourer, seconds Harvinder.The game-changerPeople used to say we have no chance in Bajpur but we proved them wrong. We have changed the rules of the game, Rawat tells HT.Congress has fielded Sunita Bajwa, wife of a Sikh BJP leader who joined Congress last month. Sunita hails from an SC family. This seat too has a mix of Muslims, Dalits, Sikhs and Tharus (tribals).Rawat stops every 50-70 meters. He exchanges greetings with the crowd near national highways. He is spending a good amount of time in two districts  US Nagar and Haridwar, which together have 20 seats. In 2012 polls BJP won 11 of these seats.Babuji (father) is full of energy. He never gives up. We want to become like him, Rawats son says as others try to keep pace with him.Its 9.30pm when CM addresses another meeting at Sultanpur Patti. He takes a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi referring him as Dilli wale Baba. I came to know that achhe din (good days) are stuck in Delhis traffic, Rawat says as the crowd cheers. He also talks about notebandi (demonetisation) here. Though demonetisation is not a political issue in the hills, it matters in the plains, where a large number of people survive on daily earnings.No breaks for CMCM refuses to take a break. Sipping sugar free black tea while travelling, Rawat speaks to Congress strategists Kumari Shailja and Ambika Soni and central observers. He fixes a programme of party vice president Rahul Gandhi before switching back to local issues.He takes feedback on Sitarganj seat from where former CM Vijay Bahugunas son is contesting on a BJP ticket. Congress has fielded a Bengali local female candidate from this seat. At 11pm, CM visits the house of a former MLA Premanand Mahajan. After 20 minutes both come out happily.Life of a neta is like this, Rawat tells this correspondent with smile on his face.When its 15 minutes past midnight, his cavalcade reaches Haldwani. As we call it a day, the CM gets busy again with his colleagues planning the next days schedule."

The entire operation was filmed.Farmers spotted the cubs while working in the fields on Wednesday morning. Forest officials moved the cubs away from the area to avoid a situation where the mother could run into people while searching for her babies.It is not uncommon to spot leopards in this area, as there are sugarcane fields that provide safe cover to the cats. But this also gives rise to conflict situations when farmers harvest the sugarcane, said Sanjay Gaikwad, forest officer from the area. We received a distress call from the village and a team was dispatched.Forest officials rescue the cubs. (Wildlife SOS)Forest officials, veterinarians form Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre (MLRC) and representatives from NGO Wildlife SOS reached the place to help the cubs. After conducting a meticulous veterinary examination for parasites and injuries, the cubs were found to be in good health and fit for release, said Dr Ajay Deshmukh, senior veterinarian, MLRC.Forest officers were informed that an adult female leopard had been spotted in the vicinity. After they were sure that this was the mother, the team put the cubs in boxes and placed them in the field where the leopard was last seen. We also placed two remote controlled camera traps to document the cubs and the reunion, said Gaikwad.Officials put the cubs in baskets and place them where the mother was last seen. (Wildlife SOS)After a two-and-half-hour wait, the team heard the mothers calls as it looked for her cubs. After checking her cubs, she carefully carried them by the scruff of the neck and moved back into the forest, said Deshmukh. Over the past eight years, we have seen many rescue operations but for the first time, witnessing a leopard family being reunited was an emotional moment for us.Over the past eight years, the state forest department has successfully reunited 60 leopard cubs with their mothers that were lost, injured or separated.The leopard came looking for the cubs, picked them up by the scruffs and carried them off. (Wildlife SOS)Forest officers added that female leopards find the tall and densely cultivated sugarcane fields good sites to give birth to and rear cubs. The issue is that when they go hunting, they leave their babies behind, said Gaikwad.Past instances of leopard cubs being reunited with their motherJanuary 9, 2017 - A three-month-old female leopard cub was rescued from a sugarcane field at Nasik, Maharashtra. After several attempts by the forest department to reunite the cub with its mother went in vain, forest officials transferred the cub to the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Center that currently houses 32 leopards.November 14, 2016 - In a 13-hour rescue operation, three two-month-old leopard cubs were successfully reunited with their mother by forest officials on Sunday at a farm near Vadgaon Rasai village, in Shirur, almost 80 kilometres away from Pune.September 17, 2016 - A one-and-half-month-old male leopard cub, separated from its mother, was rescued and reunited from a sugarcane field near Sangamner, Ahmednagar district, by forest officials.July 5, 2015  Forest officials rescued a three-month-old leopard cub from a dry well at Vadgaon Anand village in Junnar taluka, Pune district and reunited it with the mother after a 10-hour rescue operation.May 4, 2015 - Wildlife authorities at Narayangaon range in Junnar reunited four leopard cubs separated from their mother early, after treating them at a local rescue centre.(Source: Maharashtra Forest Department)READ MOREIn Mumbai: Oldest captive resident of SGNP, female leopard Krishna dies at 18"

That problem could be easily rectified by asking the man at the stall to make the chai really tagda, strong. The resultant brew is (almost) always perfect.The camera-toting flneurs, of course, dont hang out at these dusty street chai stalls for the humble chai (they can always go for flies-free High Tea at big hotels). The real pull of these places is to taste the flavour of the unique hyperlocal worlds that these tea stalls are parts of and which they also help create.One of the most atmospheric chai stalls in the capital is in Old Delhi, though this shack is only three years old.Lallans stall has no name  it is simply run by Lallan (he uses only one name). It consists of an arched niche that is part of an old dilapidated building in Galli Choori Wallan, a street that was once home to bangle sellers.Lallan, a man in his late 20s, walks to this spot every morning at seven from his room in the vicinity, which he shares with half-a-dozen brick-layers.Within minutes, he sets up his stove, a kettle, a steel tray, a box of sugar, a box of chai patti, stacks of white plastic glasses, a pan of milk, strainers, and a few tea snacks such as the flaky fen, made in the neighbourhood bakeries. Lallan carries all of this paraphernalia in a beautiful rust-coloured metal trunk on which the customers are later permitted to sit.The good time to visit the place is at 8 in the morning  the stall remains open until 7pm.Once you are here, you might realize that the most intense way to experience the tea stall is by gazing at it from across the street. The beautifully carved arch and its derelict wall  ruined enough to show lakhori bricks beneath the peeling outer surface  stand out as souvenirs to the vanishing beauty of Old Delhi architecture.This other-worldly enigma is pleasantly balanced by Lallan and his customers, some of whom have their noses buried within the pages of Hindi dailies.Most morning regulars happen to be rickshaw pullers or daily wage labourers  the latter are seen dragging loads all day long on wooden trolleys across the Walled Citys byzantine lanes.Lallan himself started his life in Delhi a few years ago as one such daily wage labourer. His parents, wife and four children live in his village in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, where they have a one-acre farm.Now, the real thing. It turns out that the chai doesnt need the trappings of the chai stalls architectural backdrop. Flavoured with ginger, it is strong and reinvigorating enough to turn you into a Lallan loyalist."

Scores of researchers and experts have launched exhaustive searches to find the root cause of this deadly disease, but to no avail. Until now.In 2014, hundreds of children were admitted to hospital with symptoms of this illness, locally called as chamki ki bimari, or tinsel disease. Of 390 admitted for treatment, 122 died, reports CNN.A new report published in The Lancet Global Health medical journal, claims to have discovered the source of the disease, which is the litchi fruit.The illness, whose symptoms are said to resemble encephalitis, have several factors contributing to it including, heat, humidity, malnourishment and pesticides.Researchers from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Indias National Centre for Disease Control compared test results of children who had developed the mysterious illness, and children who had not.According to the study, most the sick children had consumed the fruit recently and were also six times more likely to have visited a fruit orchard in the last 24 hours.Muzaffarpur, is the largest litchi farming region in India.The results said that children who fell ill were twice as likely to have skipped dinner, which, according to the researchers probably resulted in night-time hypoglycaemia.However, urine samples showed that two-thirds of the ill children showed evidence of exposure to toxins found in lychee seeds -- found in higher levels in unripe fruits.In the presence of these toxins glucose synthesis is severely impaired, the study said, leading to dangerously low blood sugar and brain inflammation in the children.Following the developments, the Centre had issued a statement advising children to henceforth minimise litchi fruit consumption in affected areas, and eat an evening meal during the outbreak period."

An example Kejriwal indeed set through his letter addressed to Punjab chief electoral officer VK Singh in which date was written 21-01-2019. No doubt Kejriwal is ahead of times  at least by two years.SHOLLY STILL IN FRAY !Liquor baron Shiv Lal Doda, alias Sholly, and his nephew, Amit Doda, who are in jail in a murder case, failed to withdraw their nomination papers from Abohar segment by the Saturday deadline. Thus, despite having declared support to the BJP candidate, both remain on the EVM. While Amit has been given AC as symbol, Sholly has been allotted bucket. Ashok Ahuja, political agent of Shiv Lal Doda and Amit, came to withdraw nomination papers of the duo but he was not authorised fir it, said SDM Jaspreet Singh, who is the returning officer.

For getting advertisements published in vernacular newspapers without the approval of the election commissions watchdog media certification and monitoring committee (MCMC), the panel has added a sum of Rs 77,133 to the election expenditure of AAP. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is second on the list with an estimation of cost of such advertisements at Rs 33,057. Similarly, an expenditure of Rs 30,976 was added to the SADs account and Rs 13,257 to that of the Congress.MISSING KHANNA!Gurdaspur member of Parliament Vinod Khanna is again in the news for his absence in the poll-bound state. However, the activists of his party are expecting little from the actor, going by the precedent he had set in the 2012 Lok Sabha elections when he despite being a candidate was conspicuous by his absence. Some say he has some health problems. Whatever may be the reason, striking a balance between the glamour world and politics is not always easy!NAMESAKE CHALLENGEFormidable rivals in elections dont trouble a candidate as much as a non-entity namesake can! Parties have been fielding namesakes of candidates of rival outfits for long. The problem is being faced by many candidates in Patiala district. Congress nominee from Samana Rajinder Singh has a namesake in an Independent, who doesnt even belong to the segment. Similarly, Congress candidate from Shutrana Nirmal Singh has two namesake independent candidates. Aam Aadmi Partys Sanaur candidate Kuldeep Kaur too has a namesake pitted against her. Thankfully, this time pictures of each candidate will be there on the voting machine beside the name and the party symbol for the ease of the voter.

Inspector Daulatram Jogawat, who weighed 180-kg, underwent a bariatric surgery at a Mumbai hospital on Thursday for reducing the volume of the stomach to curb the food intake.Two IPS officers, Kushum Punia a 2010 batch officer of Jharkhand cadre, and Kumar Gautam, a 2011 batch officer belonging to West Bengal cadre, were sacked from the service as they failed to clear their mandated physical fitness tests as probationers.They were reinstated only after they cleared the test. Punia had not cleared her swimming test as part of basic course for IPS officers at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, while Gautam didnt clear cross-country race test.Taking a strict view of the matter, the Union home ministry discharged them from service last year. But they sought another chance on compassionate ground following which they appeared for the test and cleared them. We have not reinstated them, a home ministry official said. The message is very clear. The IPS recruits will have to take their physical fitness parameters very seriously, said the official.This is not only case when the home ministry has taken a stern view over adherence to physical fitness parameters of newly inducted IPS officers. Two other IPS recruits of 2015 batch were also not cleared when their BMI and blood sugar level was not found satisfactory. While the IPS officer with higher BMI lost weight to conform to the set parameter, the second officer with higher blood sugar took another test which he duly cleared."

If you must binge, go for grilled and baked items instead of the fried ones, said nutritionist Neha Arora.There is nothing as stress-free diet per se, but there are certain food items that help in improving concentration and combating stress better.The mantra lies in not just what you eat, but also when you eat and how you eat.Read: Take it easy, exams are not the end of lifeBreakfast important meal of the dayBreakfast must not be skipped at any cost. It is important to provide the body energy after eight to nine hours of fasting. And it must have a good mix of carbohydrates and proteins; however, white bread and sugar-rich items such as biscuits must be avoided completely as they are instant energy boosters that affects body metabolism adversely.A glass of milk is a must as it contains tryptophan, a mood stabilizer that helps in reducing stress.No heavy mealsEating heavy meals during stress can lead to irritable bowel syndrome that can affect your concentration.Six meals in a day are ideal; with three major meals and three small meals in between. Lunch should comprise roti, dal, vegetable and curd. For non-vegetarians, chicken and fish are a good source of essential protein. Dinner should have at least one protein-rich item, but must be the lightest meal of the day. Curd is a must have, as it improves nerve impulses and neutralizes acidity.Consume fruitsFruits should be taken as fillers in-between meals. The high-fibre content found in fruits and vegetables helps relieve constipation, which is one of the side-effects of stress. Carrot in particular is rich in vitamins necessary for reducing stress, and is readily available during this season. One can also opt for sprouts that are full of essential nutrients and are easy to digest, so one doesnt feel lethargic after consuming sprouts.Read: Cracking the boards: Release the exam pressure, take a break between studiesFluid nourishmentIt is essential for the body to stay hydrated. When the body does not have enough fluids to work efficiently, it can develop muscle cramps, dizziness or what is called lightheadedness. Not just water; one should have fluids in the form of fresh lime water, coconut water, buttermilk etc. to meet the bodys requirement and to maintain electrolyte balance.Avoid unnecessary medicinesThere is a variety of memory enhancers available in market these days, but experts do not recommend popping in pills randomly. At such young age, you do not really have memory issues. Their problem is more to do with stress and anxiety.

But they do not declare details of calories and nutrition.Declaring details of calorie intake and nutrition information ensures that consumers are informed.

By May 5 this year, some categories of restaurants in the US will have to comply with these.FSSAI is likely to follow the USFDA standards when it decides to notify rules, although there is no plan to do this immediately.We are working with FSSAI and disclosing information on nutrition and calorie intake will not be an issue, said a spokesperson for the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Northern India that has 1,700 members across nine states.

Ltd that runs popular restaurant and bar and cafe chains such as Smoke House Deli and Social.The food regulator is also working on standards for organic food, including grains, which will be notified by the end of February, the FSSAI CEO said.The food services market in India is projected to grow from Rs 3.09 trillion in 2016 to Rs 4.98 trillion by 2021, expanding at an annual average rate of 10%, according to a NRAI-Technopak report."

Arora allegedly used the OD account to transfer Rs 15 lakhs to Jain Abhushan same day.This process was again repeated next day albeit with different amount, it said.Between November 11 and December 29, 2016, Arora kept on depositing old currency totalling over Rs 6.50 crore which were credited to various companies, the CBI alleged.According to the FIR, Rs 2.40 crore was transferred to Dhampur Sugar Mills Pvt Limited, Rs 1.30 crore to Jain Abhushan, Rs 90 lakhs to Jindal Bullions, Rs 25 lakhs to Gogia Flour Mills Pvt Limited, totalling Rs 6.77 crores.These amounts were transferred by Arora without having any business transactions with these companies, it alleged.Arora has acted as money mule and dishonestly got transferred demonetised currency notes by adopting such illegal activity with the active connivance of S K Dogra, chief manager, who by abusing his official position, has also allowed transactions in both the accounts -current account and OD account simultaneously, in violation of Bankers Book of Instructions, 2012 of Bank of Baroda, the FIR alleged.It said that such large cash deposits were allowed by Dogra despite Aroras account not being KYC compliant.Dogra falsely informed anti-money-laundering officer (AMLO) of the bank that these amounts have been credited to sugar mills as Arora was a wholesale dealer and his account was KYC compliant.In his communication, Dogra did not inform AMLO that the money was being transferred to jewellers and with dishonest intention did not intimate these high value transaction to regional heads, as required by the Bank of Baroda procedures put in place last year, it alleged.CBI said that Dogra connived with Arora and other unknown persons and by misusing his official position, he dishonestly exceeded the OD limit in the name of Arora and also allowed him to deposit the cash amount in the form of demonetised notes repeatedly.He transferred the said funds to other person and companies on the request of Arora with the objective to defeat government policy pertaining to demonetising of high valued government currency notes, the FIR added."

Its report are not considered as official report of the US Congress.In its 42-page report CRS notes that during 2010-2016, Indias private sector described Iran as a controversial market a term used by many international firms to describe markets that entail reputational and financial risks.In January 2012, Iran agreed to accept Indias currency rupee to settle 45% of its oil sales to India, which Iran mostly used to buy Indian wheat, pharmaceuticals, rice, sugar, soybeans, auto parts and other products.India reduced its imports of Iranian oil substantially after 2011 - by the time of the JPA, Iran was only supplying about six per cent of Indias oil imports, down from over 16% in 2008. India incurred significant costs to retrofit refineries that were handling Iranian crude. However, since the JCPOA, oil imports apparently have increased to close to 2011 levels, the report said.Indian firms ended or slowed work on investments in Iranian oil and gas fieldswork that is likely to resume now that sanctions have been lifted, CRS said, adding that India and Iran are considering using Turkeys Halkbank to transfer to Iran $6.5 billion for oil purchased by India during 2012-2016.In 2015, India and Iran agreed that India would help develop Irans Chahbahar port that would enable it to trade with Afghanistan unimpeded by Pakistan.With sanctions on Iran now lifted, that project no longer entails risk to Indian firms involved. In May 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Iran and signed an agreement to invest $500 million to develop the port and related infrastructure, CRS said.The report came as US President Donald Trump criticised Iran over its actions. The White House put Iran on notice over the move and vowed to take action, setting the stage for confrontation between the two nations."

She is not able to feed her two children. We dont have a house or a job to make a living, Devi said.Rural and urban residents differed in their priorities while voting on Saturday. While the rural voters gave more importance to jobs, houses, growth opportunities and safety in remote towns, the urban voters were more specific about the development requirements for their areas, the need for a better administration and improvement in women security.In small towns, there is hardly any development and growth opportunity for youngsters. There are ample opportunities in other states, but not here. Women safety is a big issue for us. Forget about evening or night, I dread stepping out even during the day, Shivani Verma, a software engineer from Murad Nagar who works in Noida, said.I think there have been enough of freebies distributed from public money. All this should stop and funds must be utilised for public works, her sister Priyanka said.Seventy-year-old Abdul Hafiz stressed on the need to have a sakht hakim (strong administrator) to rule the state.This time, there were many communal riots in UP.

I voted for growth and development. There are lot of pollution related issues in Kaushambi and a case is going on in the National Green Tribunal. I think there has to be a better coordination between the Centre and the state and I have voted keeping that in mind, Singh said. His wife said women security is a major issue that determined her vote.Far away in Modi Nagar town, which falls under the prime sugarcane belt in western UP, farmer Pawan Kumar from Sikri Khurd narrated his ordeal of pending payment for his sugarcane produce that he supplied to sugar mills.We are asked to supply daily but payment remains pending for one to two months. How do I run my household? We are fed up with corruption and goonda activities. My priority for voting is not development, it is my pending payment, he said.However, Mohammad Shahwez from Modi Nagar was happy to vote as his aim wasgetting free laptops and a smartphone.Kaam ko salaam hai sir ji (the one who works will get benefit)... local issues take a back seat when you get facilities in your hand, he said."

Rooting for local BJP candidates in the UP assembly elections, the PM said that Badaun was among the least developed parts of the country despite being a VIP district.Badaun has been the base of Mayawati and now it is known to be the base of Samajwadi Party. It is a VIP district. Even then, it is one of the least developed districts, he said.The Prime Minister also rubbished the development plank of the SP-Congress alliance.

But in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, where we have BJP governments, 7 to 11% of the wheat is procured by the government at the minimum price, he said, adding that a BJP government in UP will also waive off farmers debts.Read the full coverage of the UP assembly electionsMaking inroads in SP terrainWith its over 80% population dependent on agriculture, Badaun is known as a hub of potato, wheat and sugarcane farming in the region.

Badaun is also one of the five assembly seats that SP won in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.Considering that the district has a considerable population of Hindu voters, the BJP is trying to make inroads here.

58ff05617be9e0429666c9d5,"From the heartland: Caste, religion and Muzaffarnagar model of politics in UP",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-the-heartland-caste-religion-and-muzaffarnagar-model-of-politics-in-up/story-CcBZ1bz124xujk1dFtbq4O.html,2017-02-07,"The sugarcane fields of western Uttar Pradesh are loaded with the luscious crop, which wave as the wind wafts, but the electoral joust has raised the temperature all around. Some talk of social polarisation, others of social indifference and severance. The apocalyptic Muzaffarnagar model of 2013 continues to haunt people. It impacted the 2014 Lok Sabha elections but whether it would impact the 2017 polls to the assembly--no one can predict still.I was a party to a very passionate debate in the interiors of Muzaffarnagar at Lalukheri. In a tea shop at Sisauli tri-junction, I tried to probe the minds of a multitude of people sipping tea. It took a while for them to shake off their reservations and down their guard. But what followed was a pouring of their heart--the litany of their sufferings, their pain and suffocation just exploded.An elder said the normal trend in these parts has been to flow with the tide, but the last time people did that, the result was painful. I have undergone a bypass and I cant queue long enough to vote. I queued up before a bank for long hours to return without cash. My son is to be married. Now you tell me, what do I do next and how, he said.A young man who overheard the conversation reacted violently, My entire savings have been seized. We heard the bank had been replenished with cash after eight-ten days. I rushed there, only to find that the currency had run out. I do not have a penny in hand.Even before I could react, a third voice rose above the din, this time full of anger. What are you talking about? We are voting to elect an MLA. What you talk of is plain nonsense, first talk of the issues facing the state. My MLA never does reappear, once he wins it.What about the MP, I wonder and pat comes the reply. He too is absconding. Most people here debate in anguish how Netaji and his minions just gave up the people--whether they won, or lost.I thought the debate on demonetisation and its impact was over, when a gentleman challenged me, saying, Forget the banks. Lets visit an ATM. Dogs wallow in them. That set off a general commotion--some for demonetisation, some against. Demonetisation does shadow the general debate, wherever one goes, though whether it would colour this election is not a given.To take the debate off it, and further, I cautiously probed, whether they got the right price for their crops. The answer was cryptic, bitter.Farmers here have been drowned in debt. The state promises loan waivers and promises fresh loans. But most have been caught in a vicious cycle of banks and moneylenders. It would have been better had we got a good price to clear our debts and were able to add broad base farming activity, said one. This area of western UP is known for the vicious web of private money lenders and the trauma of those caught in their web.See the irony. This is the area which sprung the politics of late Chaudhary Charan Singh. Many still mistake him for just a Jat leader. Its true that the Jats constituted his major vote base but he was the first to raise the issues of farmers, and over generations--right from the streets up to Parliament. This is again the heartland of the towering kisan leader Mahendra Singh Tikait whose one call was enough to make people spill into the streets. The issues then were as complex, as they are now.Leaders have come and gone. Elections too have come and gone. The state is in for another election but it would seem there is nobody to debate the issues of farmers any more. I asked, why is it so?The invectives which followed stunned.Why dont you put the issues before people who ask for your votes with as much stringency? I asked. The answers were many, the summary of which largely was that politicians just care for their own community, caste and creed. They hardly have the time or patience to talk to the last man.Custodians of caste and religion are now out with different slogans of development, while dwelling on caste configurations or raising the bogey of faith in danger.How much does all of this impact the voters? To understand, I ventured to ask people how they personally reacted to religion, caste and development, and which of them mattered most.They reacted with intelligence--it has to be security, then development. It does not require much to understand that by security they emphasise caste and religion. That could only reinforce the Muzaffarnagar model of politics that so shaped the past elections in these parts.MEN WHO MATTER IN MEERUT-SAHARANPUR ARC5 REASONS WHY REGION MATTERS1. Farmers in this arc make the backbone of politics and commerce. Mangoes from this area are exported in large number to several countries2.

Sources say fielding him from the Shirsufal-Gunwadi constituency in the Pune zilla parishad elections was a conscious decision on the part of the Pawar family. However, his entry into politics was a low-profile event.The late Appasaheb is highly respected in Maharashtra for his contributions to the development of the farm sector. Rohits father, Rajendra, is also respected for work performed through the Baramati Krishi Vikas Pratishthan.Sharads mother, Shardabai, was a member of the local board in the pre-Independence era. The NCP chief, who launched his political career by being elected as an MLA from Baramati in 1967, has been in politics for five decades now.Others in his family  daughter Supriya Sule and nephew Ajit Pawar  have also found their calling in the profession.At present, the Pawars are locked in a gritty battle to protect their traditional bastions of Baramati and Pune. The first indication of a decline in their hold over the two constituencies came in 2014, when Supriya Sule managed to retain the Baramati Lok Sabha seat with a relatively small margin of 70,000 votes. On the other hand, she had won the 2009 Lok Sabha elections with a margin of over three lakh votes.In 2014 assembly elections, Ajit secured 28,000 less votes as compared to the 2009 polls.Elections held to municipal councils over the last two months continued to show a similar trend. Anti-Pawar forces managed to win every municipal council election conducted in the vicinity of Baramati, including Daund, Indapur, Saswad and Shirur. In the Baramati municipal council, the ruling BJP managed to win four seats for the very first time.The Pawar family is now struggling to retain its hold over the Pune Municipal Corporation, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and the Pune Zilla Parishad. Several NCP leaders in Pune have joined the BJP over the last few months, making survival seem even more difficult for the family.Now, it remains to be seen whether Rohit can reverse the dipping fortunes of the Pawar family."

At present, people look at forests as a hindrance. They know that the forest is home to various wildlife species, but only a limited area is accessible.People also think that the forest is only meant for safaris. But there is much more to forests which they should be made aware of. Forest cover is being reduced. The agricultural land and urban areas are increasing, which is leading to conflicts, he said.Charles Lobo, chief post master general, Karnataka Circle, said the postal department releases a special stamp dedicated to wildlife during every wildlife week celebrations. Karnataka has over 60 permanent special cancelations. Among them, 10 are exclusive to wildlife like of Nagarahole, Bandipur, black bucks, sloth bears of Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary and Kokkarebellur.K S Sugara, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), said safety of the ground staff is paramount.

Instead, childrens palate is assaulted with unhealthy food high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) and low on essential nutrients they need to grow mentally and physically.Chips, sweetened beverages, instant noodles, fries, samosas, bread pakoras and patties are the standard fare in most school cafeterias. When schools ban them, enterprising vendors set up makeshift kiosks and sell meals-on-bicycles outside schools. With no running water or quality control for cooking and storing, most children end up with empty calories and very often, gut-destroying germs.All refined, fried and processed foods are just empty calories because most of the essential sugar and fat the body needs is present naturally in food, such as sugar in fruits and fat in dairy, seeds, nuts, meats and cooking oil, says Rahul Verma, founder of the Delhi-based non-profit Uday Foundation, which filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court in December 2010 asking for a ban on the sale of junk food in schools. Though traditional snacks are freshly made and do not have additives such as colour and preservatives added to them, they are usually high in low quality oils, salts and sugars, Verma underlines.In March 2015, the Delhi High Court asked the administrator of Delhi to issue healthy eating guidelines under Rule 43 of the Delhi School Education Rules, 1973, and directed the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to formulate guidelines, which have since been circulated but are not binding.While many private schools in Delhi and Mumbai have not waited for government guidelines and moved towards healthier snacks years ago, Punjab, where the states child rights commission banned junk food in schools in January 2016, unhealthy foods are still widely available.Delhis Springdales School, Pusa Road, removed fried snacks and aerated drinks from their canteen menu a decade ago. The shift in the attitude occurred after a survey showed 70% of the students were overweight and were either suffering from associated conditions or would grow up to be unhealthy adults.Children have only one meal in school during recess. To make the child healthy over-all, we have to involve the parents. Too many children were getting two-minute noodles, fried potato taters or foods high on sugar and fats, says Ameeta Wattal, principal, Springdales, where poha, idli sambar and wholewheat sandwiches are sold along with drinks like lassi, chaach and lime juice.Read | Out of the box: Healthy eating is now part of school lunchroomsThese foods are also part of the cafeteria menu at Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, where the menu is changed periodically to include seasonal vegetables. The school also has a committee  consisting of teachers, students and some parents who work in the field of nutrition -- that monitor the nutrition value of the food, the taste and the oil it is cooked in. Our canteen is outsourced, but we strictly monitor it to make sure that the quality of the food is maintained, says Manohar Lal, principal of the school.In Lucknows La Martiniere Girls College, children are encouraged to eat more fruit and vegetables from kindergarten. The practice was introduced by our former principal Late Farida Abraham and it is still continuing, vice-principal Aashrita Dass told HT.In Mumbai, parents associations are sore at the lack of guidelines in Maharashtra. Schools receive cutbacks from vendors, and canteen contractors also prefer such items because it boosts their sales, says Jayant Jain, president, Forum for Fairness in Education, a parent-teacher body.Read | Boys in India eat better than girls: Oxford studyEven education officials admit they do not check whether schools serve junk food as there is no regulation against it so far. We cannot stop a school from serving junk food, as there is no official ban in place. We can at best advise them to opt for healthier choices, concedes BB Chavan, deputy director of education, Mumbai division.While many schools said it is difficult to restrict junk food in its vicinity, some have come up with innovative ways to restrict fast food in the campus: Rajhans Vidyalaya in Andheri serves fresh, hot and hygienic food breakfast and lunch on campus and doesnt allow home food to ensure parents dont send unhealthy food. Aerated drinks are banned.At Ryan International, Kandivali, teachers patrol the streets after school to ensure children walking out dont stop at the nearby McDonalds or other junk food joints.In government-run schools, the hot meals provided under the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (Mid Day Meal Scheme) are nutritive and safe but remain a challenge in many districts. The scheme was launched to increase enrolment, retention and attendance while improving the nutrition levels of children by giving them 300 calories of energy, 8-12 gm of protein and adequate micronutrients.The meals were not good enough to keep children in school. A 2015 audit of the action taken on the Comptroller and Auditor Generals 2008 Report on Mid Day Meal Scheme showed that the enrolment of children in the midday meals-covered schools dropped from 14.69 crore in 2009-10 to 13.87 crore in 2013-14, while enrolment in private schools shot up by 38% in the same period.The audit also found children were given less than the prescribed quantity of 100/150 gms of foodgrains and prescribed inspections were not carried out to ensure quality. Most schools sample checked in the audit were lacking in infrastructural facilities like kitchen sheds, proper utensils, availability of drinking water facility etc. There were several instances of food being cooked in the open in unhygienic conditions, the report found.Few lessons seem to have been learnt from the shocking case of negligence that left 23 children dead and dozens others seriously ill after they ate a pesticide-laced midday-meal at a primary school in the village of Dharmashati Gandaman in the Saran district in Bihar in July 2013. A month later, 30 children fell ill in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh; and in November 2014, 25 children fell ill after eating their mid-day meal at a government school in Gaya district in Bihar.In July 2016,40 students fell ill in Chincholi village of Adilabad district of Telangana after eating food prepared in the school kitchen for a farewell party for seniors. In September that year, 25 students were hospitalised in Kolar district in KarnatakaIn September 2015, about 150 students in Chandoor town and Ilapuram village in Telangana started vomiting after their mid-day meal.Such cases of food poisoning are very rare and take place in remote areas due to lack of proper supervision and maintenance of kitchen. Otherwise, there is a periodical check on the quality of food by officials, parents committees and teachers. Even we eat the same food regularly to ensure the quality, said L Ravinder Rao, a senior headmaster in a government school in Ranga Reddy district of Telangana."

SGNP regrets to inform that Krishna breathed her last and succumbed to old age. She had been undergoing treatment for local wounds, chest infection and had not been eating for the past two days, said Dr Shailesh Pethe, veterinarian, SGNP. She was critical and was not responding positively to treatment.This was the second death in over a month after the park lost 16-year-old male leopard, Ahmednagar, one of the oldest animals at the park, to old age. He too, had stopped eating for two days, following which his condition became critical.Pathologists from the Bombay Veterinary College will conduct a post-mortem on Monday. Results will be disclosed on Wednesday.The average lifespan of a leopard is 12 to 14 years.After Krishnas death, there are 14 leopards  seven female and seven male  now at SGNPs leopard rescue centre, of which four  two male and two female  are over 15 years of age. Once we know the exact cause of Krishnas death, we will be conducting tests on other leopards that have come off age as a precautionary measure, added Pethe. However, they are currently fit, healthy and eating properly.Krishna was a three-month-old cub when she was brought to the park in 1999. She had been abandoned by her mother at a sugarcane field at Pen in Raigad.Park officials were deeply saddened by the incident as she had spent most of her life at SGNP. Krishna was very docile ever since we first brought her to the park. She never displayed any aggression to us (forest officers), animal keepers or even other leopards at the rescue centre. On the contrary, she could adjust very easily with other animals and we never had trouble feeding her, except during her last stages, said Shailesh Deore, range forest officer, SGNP.

However, they will take a call only after the post-mortem.In 2014, after male leopard Raja, Krishnas mate, died, she has been very lonely and nervous, said Shailesh Deore, range forest officer, SGNP. She had a few health issues then with constant loose motion. Over time, as new leopards were brought to the park, she made friends and moved on, said Deore. Rajas body was preserved through taxidermy and depending on the post mortem results, we might preserve Krishnas body too, next to Raja.READ MORENational parks oldest captive leopard is critically ill"

In the soft glow of twilight, she tucks the pallu of her cream silk sari round the waist, wraps a scarf over her head, and spreads out a mat westward towards Mecca. With her arms on her chest, she bows her head in prayer to Allah, while the husband and two children sleep in a little longer.A feet away, as the sun emerges, Seema Chaudhari (43) grabs a plastic tumbler before the morning puja. As she heads out, Begum catches up with her. Friends for 14 years, the two women groggily make their way to the river, grumbling about the din from last nights neighbourhood wedding.Begum and Chaudhari live in the main market in the contested arena of the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site, where the destruction of a 16th-century mosque in 1992 sparked some of Indias worst nationwide riots. Considered to be one of Hinduisms seven holy centres, the region is now peppered with temples flooded by Hindu devotees. As the legal dispute, which began in 1950, enters its 24th year in the Supreme Court, the saffron-tinted market of 100-odd shops and adjoining homesselling scarves, prayer beads, toy maces and other religious paraphernaliamake do without regular electricity (since the area is contested), stealing it from outside the market area and using public toilets meant for pilgrims.The saffron-tinted market at Ayodhya has 100-odd shops selling scarves, prayer beads, toy maces and other religious paraphernalia.The availability of electricity, jobs and clean water are top voter concerns in one of Indias most backward states, according to a FourthLion-IndiaSpend survey, reported here in February 2017. However, as violence has grown over this decade, the strife has retarded development and citizens appear to find it harder to shrug off mounting tensions between communities, bringing identity politics to the heart of the battle for UP.As Begum and Chaudhari talked, there was no apparent sign of tension. Cups of chai (tea) surfaced during the lean afternoon hours of the market, as the two friends sat together at one or the others shop, children in tow, sharing food, recipes and more.When you live together for so many years, youre bound to become friends, said Begum, one of the few Muslims in this epicentre of Hindu religiosity. We share everythinghave dinner together, shop together, attend each others family weddings. The violence is a distant memory.Her family fled after riots in 1993, but with nowhere to restart life, returned after a month. When we did (return), said Begum, nobody troubled us.Mask drops from friendship and politics, as UPs schisms are revealedBegum and Chaudhari are indeed friends, but when talk turned to politics and religion, schisms soon emerged, illustrating how religious differences are the foundation of life and politics across Indias most populous state. With its 200 million people, 19% Muslim and 80% Hindu, these differences are exacerbated in the seven-phase, 26-day electionvoting for which ends on March 8, 2017as Prime Minister Narendra Modi embellished his development mantras with sectarian rhetoric.This is a Hindu-dominated area; thats why it is so peaceful now, said Chaudhari, who moved to the market in 2003. Begum dismissed her friends assessment. Muslim areas are also peaceful, she said.Chaudhari insisted the neighbourhood will vote exclusively for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as the ruling national party aggressively champions the Hindutva cause this election season with none of its 370 candidates a Muslim. Quiet thus far, Begum admitted allegiance to the Samajwadi Party (SP), UPs ruling party, known to woo Muslims and Other Backward Classes (OBCs).Friendships between Hindus and Muslims are not uncommon in UP, but they appear to be rarer than ever in western UP, still recovering from 2013 riots between Jatsa Hindu upper casteand Muslims in Muzaffarnagar, UPs sugar bowl, which witnessed its most violent Hindu-Muslim clashes since the Babri Masjid was brought down more than 24 years ago.We all live together now, said 35-year-old Zainab (she uses only one name), of Kawal, a Muslim-dominated Muzaffarnagar village. On August 27, 2013, two young Jats killed a Muslim from this village for allegedly harassing their sister. Muslims later beat the boys to death, sparking off a wildfire of violence in the region; more than 50,000 Muslims fled their homes and thousands still live in refugee camps.Zainabs assertion notwithstanding, the tension is apparent as we travelled between Kawal and Malikpura, a Jat-dominated village located a few kilometres ahead. On the day IndiaSpend visited, a 15-year-old boy had just been reported missing. We realised he is missing late last night when he failed to return from school all day, said Parmila Singh (40), the boys mother. A constable at her house said colleagues were scouring the countryside. This isnt the first time he has gone missing, the police officer said, which did not mean the search for him could be delayed, given UPs record of conflagrations from sparksor rumours.The newly laid detour that separates the Muslim-dominated village of Kawal (left) and the Hindu Jat-dominated village of Malikpura in Muzaffarnagar.As we moved out of Malikpura, using a newly laid detour that villagers said the BJP had constructed for them to reduce interactions and tensions with Muslims in Kawal, we came across one of 50 paramilitary companies (with 140-150 troopers in each company) stationed in Muzaffarnagar district ahead of the elections.At a time when UPs biggest concerns centre around education, jobs and healthcarewith the states indicators being among Indias worst (as we reported here, here and here)the latest data of communal violence explain why UPs politics continues to be driven by religion, caste and identity.As communal violence soars, BJP has its finger on states pulseBetween 2010 and 2015, communal violence in Muzaffarnagar rose five-fold, according to data sourced from the office of the director general of police for Uttar Pradesh, by 101reporters.com for IndiaSpend, reflecting a trend of tension evident across 90% of the state. Meerut reported over 200 incidents in 2015.The BJPs changing election narrative, from development to identity, has been evident in the speeches of Modi, BJP party president Amit Shah (here and here) and numerous other candidates who frequently talk of love jihadthe proposition that young Muslim men try to lure Hindu women into marriage and convert them to Islamterrorism and slaughterhouses, shorthand for Muslims.Meanwhile, the ruling SP, its ally, the Congress party, and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), play on the apprehensions of minorities and poorer Hindu castes.In 2010, UP registered nearly 600 crimes of communal violence across its 75 districts. By 2015, the state crime records bureau logged 3,601 such violent incidents. These data, however, do not find a place in the annual National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) statistics, which are compiled from state reports.Until 2014, the NCRB did not categorise riots as communal or otherwise (industrial, agrarian or caste related, for instance). In 2014, when it first had the heading communal riots, for UP, it listed 51 riots. In comparison, state data for 2014 counted 2802 communal violence incidents.UP officials also told IndiaSpend that many communal incidents were minorand mostly started over the assumed need to protect their womens honour.These things are more likely to happen because political parties with vested interests like to appease different communities, Amitabh Thakur, Inspector General for Rules and Manuals told IndiaSpend. In some parts of Western UP, even a small knock on the cycle can end in a fight between four or five persons.Minor incidents make neighbourhoods, districts and state tenseThe scale of these minor incidents and their petty triggers, which the state police record but do not pass on to the NCRB, reflect the tensions that run through UP.When a small incident occurs, we immediately send our forces in and douse the situation before it is given any chance to explode further, said deputy superintendent SKS Pratap at Jansath police station in Muzaffarnagar, less than 10 km from Kawal. We dont give netas a chance to exploit it for mileage. His confidence in curbing small incidents before they escalate into riots was echoed at other police stations IndiaSpend visited across western and eastern UP.The trivial start-stop nature of these incidents belies the significant bearing they tend to have on the psychology of the neighbourhood, district, and state at large.Over five years, except for eight of 75 districts, communal violence increased across UP.While Meerut district in western UP, with 234 cases, reported the most incidents, about 130 km to the east, Sambhal district reported the highest rate of increase in violence in five years.From registering just one incident in 2010, Sambhal district reported 192 cases of communal violence in 2015. Of the 20 districts reporting the largest increase in violence, 14 were located in western UP, according to our analysis. This rise in violence is apparent in villages, towns and cities.How polarisation fuels politicsand vice versaWe witnessed how the ferment, caused by the steady escalation in communal violence in the run-up to the assembly elections, was not restricted to the nationally known flashpoints of Muzaffarnagar or Ayodhya.

(The cow is our mother and they eat cowhow can that work?)Prayers being offered at Assi Ghat, on the banks of the river Ganga in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. From zero incidents of communal violence in 2010, Varanasi was witness to 31 incidents in 2015.The trivial start-stop nature of these incidents belies the significant bearing they tend to have on the psychology of the neighbourhood, district, and state at large.Over five years, except for eight of 75 districts, communal violence increased across UP.While Meerut district in western UP, with 234 cases, reported the most incidents, about 130 km to the east, Sambhal district reported the highest rate of increase in violence in five years.From registering just one incident in 2010, Sambhal district reported 192 cases of communal violence in 2015.

More than 50,000 Muslims fled their homes in the aftermath of the 2013 riots and thousands still live in refugee camps.Next to him, 67-year-old Bopal Singh Balyan slowly added: They left out of greedthe Akhilesh (Yadav, the states chief minister) government was handing out big compensation packages for people who claim to be riot-victims. Why would they want to return?In Bishada villagewhere in 2015 ironsmith Mohammad Akhlaq was lynched to death for allegedly eating beef, which is banned in UP, except for foreignersthe surface calm was quickly dispelled by a 25-year-old man, who did not want to be identified.Everybody loves Muslim victims: One dies, 100 people come flocking, he said. If a Hindu diesin police custody, that too nobody gives a damn.The BJP does not allay Muslim fears, upper-caste Hindus are comfortedBisada is a stronghold of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological mentor, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organisation banned three times in post-colonial Indiathe first time in 1948 after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.In the aftermath of the lynching, villagers said, only the national ruling party stood by them. Prior to the start of polling in February 2017, union home minister Rajnath Singh even held a rally here. This village always votes for BJPwere the only ones saving Hindustan and we will keep saving it over and over again, the young man said, animatedly.Bisada village in Dadri, Gautambuddha Nagar district, western Uttar Pradesh, where ironsmith Mohammad Ikhlaq was lynched to death in 2015 for allegedly eating beef.A deep resentment lurks here among unemployed youth. Septuagenarian Munnidevi said: After the (lynching) episode, whenever employers hear the applicant is from Bisada, they dont hire them. If the government cared for us, our children would not loiter here jobless and angry.In Lucknow, driver Nitin Patel (25), a Hindu moderate and BJP supporter from Sultanpur district, explained the psychology of upper-caste Hindus. The SP is mainly for the Muslims and OBCs (other backward castes), former chief minister Mayawatis BSP works for Dalits and OBCs, said Patel. Only the BJP listens to us, so what are we to do?The BJP has done little to calm Muslim fears.Not a single BJP candidate has come to this area, said Asif Saifi (23), an unemployed man, in Kaila Bhatta, Ghaziabad, a tinderbox of a town, known to explode whenever communal violence is reported elsewhere in UP. If they cared for our vote, they would have at least given one ticket to a Muslim. The lack of a Muslim candidate was an issue even the BJPs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, a Muslim from UP, referred to:It would have been better if BJP gave tickets to #Muslims for ongoing #UPpolls, says Union Minister @naqvimukhtar.  Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) February 27, 2017In the resettlement colonies of riot victims in Kandhla, 56 km west of Muzaffarnagar, home to over 300 rehabilitated Muslim families, there was unanimity in support for the SP. No other party has bothered to come here and help us in our plight, said 40-year-old Imrana (she uses only one name), a homemaker.Ateek Ansari, a local reporter in Varanasi, believed speeches by the Prime Minister and his colleagues on love jihad, cow-protection and Muslim personal law have further scared Muslims. We feel if we let them win the elections, there will be riots that threaten our very existence, he said. Its convinced Muslims across UP to think that come what may, we need to stop Modi.To do so, Ansari said, Muslims must fall back on negative voting, supporting the strongest contender who could defeat the BJP. While many consider the SP-Congress an obvious choice, this approach is also likely to split the BSP vote.Meanwhile, there are a few Muslims, such as Naru Ansari (32), a construction-site manager from eastern UPs Gorakhpurthe constituency of BJP MP Yogi Adityanath, head priest of a temple, he echoes a Hindu far-right and, often, openly anti-Muslim agendawho feel safe voting for the national ruling party. Yogi Adityanath has been an MP here since 1998, said Naru Ansari. He protects us. If politicians arent controversial, how will they stay relevant?Back at the Ram Janmabhoomi market in Ayodhya, sitting between puja wares of copper, silver and gold, shopkeeper Sarvankumar Pandey (55) twirled his fingers, as if spinning a ball of fruit. Have you ever seen an orange? he asked. Covered in a thick orange skin, it appears as one whole fruit, said Pandey. But peel off the leathery rind, and the segments come apart with ease.

Have you ever seen an orange? he asked. Covered in a thick orange skin, it appears as one whole fruit, said Pandey. But peel off the leathery rind, and the segments come apart with ease. This is exactly how Hindus and Muslims are in UP, he said.Shia Muslims Archan Haider, Afzal Haider and Naushad Ali in Hussainabad, Old Lucknow, espoused their unequivocal support for the Bharatiya Janata Party.Younger Shias in Hussainabad said they would vote for the BSP. Students Rahil (19) and Sharif (20) Mirza said they could not forget the terror inflicted on our people under Modis watch in Gujarat in 2002, more relevant to them than riots closer home.Shias are 10-13% of the world Muslim population, according to this 2009 Pew Research Institute report, and India is said to have the worlds second-largest Shia population after Iran.There are also sub-sect divides to consider, such as those between Barelvis, Deobandis, and Salafis, interwoven with caste differencesa remnant of the Hindu past, prior to conversion centuries ago.Aligarh city alone has 24 Muslim caste associations, according to historians Christopher Jaffrelot and Laurent Gayers 2012 book, Muslims in Indian Cities: Trajectories of Marginalisation. These differences play a significant role during elections, they wrote.This Shia-Sunni divide was clearest during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots: Shias said they fought alongside Hindus against the Sunnis.In a Muslim ambush of Jats riding in on tractors, armed with sticks and scythes, Shias helped Hindus escape. We saw that if we did not intervene, the Hindus would die, Shah Alam Zaidi (50), a medical practitioner without qualificationsor quacktold IndiaSpend over telephone from the village of Jauli in east Muzaffarnagar. We hid them in our houses till the violence died down. He added that thereafterfor the first time in over 200 yearswith the support of Jats, Shias could hold a Muharram procession in the village.However, the Shias of western UP arent likely to vote for the BJP this season. Their reasons reflect the disillusionment evident among upper-caste Hindus, the BJPs traditional vote bank.Modis demonetisation policy, colloquially referred to as notebandi, pulled out of circulation 86% of Indias bank notes, on November 8, 2016, and its effects are still widespread. In this largely rural region bordering the national capital, western UPs farmers are angry. As they wait for the BJP to deliver on the promise of reservations for Jats and Gujjars, the Rashtriya Lok Dal has emerged as a favoured alternative.We have always supported the BJP, said farmer Rajeev Kashyap (45) of the Kashyap clan in Kutba, Muzaffarnagar, breaking from the Balyans, who have stayed loyal to the BJP. But where is the development we were promised?UP wants development but strife keeps it backwardUP is one of Indias least-developed states, with indicators worse than the national average and, often, among the countrys lowest, as IndiaSpend has reported (here and here). Since the 1990s, the gap between UP and other states has widened, as post-liberalisation economic reforms reduced the countrys capacity to spread investment across India, wrote Craig Jeffery in his 2014 book, Development Failure and Identity Politics in Uttar Pradesh. Corporations looking to invest in India tended to set up in states with good records in terms of crime and corruption, wrote Jeffrey. There has been some improvement since the 2000s, but this has mainly been in UP districts that are close to or form a part of the national capital territory of Delhi, Indias richest region, by per capita income.In this scenario of low-development, Muslims are further marginalised, observed both Gayer and Jaffrelot. However, with the 2011 census withholding religious data on development indicators, it is difficult to accurately ascertain the level of inequal development.The strife in UP has not helped. In countries with violence, economic growth falls, as does access to electricity and the Internet, and the school dropout rate rises, noted this 2017 World Bank report on governance and security.These trends are evident in UP, and they were particularly clear when we visited refugee camps in Shamli district, western UP. Girls were married early, and women were forced to stay at home for security.In the refugee camps, 42 months for a ration card that should take 30 daysWhile some colonies have received enough compensation from the state to start anew, they could not find employment. Our men dont get work as often as we used to in our old villagepeople here dont know us so they dont easily employ us, said 32-year-old homemaker Buriya (she uses one name) in the riot-victim colony of Hamza, at Kandhla in Shamli district.Land prices rose after riot victims received compensation money, and only 1,200 families among many thousand have received ration cards over 42 months, a process that should take less than 30 days.Thirty two-year-old homemaker Buriya, in the riot-victim colony of Hamza, at Kandhla in Shamli district, said it is harder for the displaced Muslims to find work in the resettled areas.Officials seem to forget these people have fled their villages, said Akram Akhtar of AFKAR India Foundation, a nonprofit helping Muslim riot-victims. He accused the Hindu-dominated administration of insensitivity. They stubbornly refuse to cooperate using statements like How do we know youre not actually from Pakistan?Despite these problems, victims arent willing to return to their native villages.We sometimes meet our old Hindu neighbours on the road, said Abdul Sattar, who fled Kutba village in Muzaffarnagar after his brother and nephew were killed. They speak to us nicely and even ask us to come back saying everything is peaceful now, but we wontshaking hands cant guarantee they wont stab us in the back again.So, the refugee camps continue without electricity, water supply, and education. We dont have the himmat (courage) to send our children to school, said Mohammed Ayub Sheikh, whose family fled from the village of Lisarh after the 2013 riots. Were barely surviving day-to-day.Back in the market of Ayodhya, shopkeeper Pandey said it was unlikely the area would erupt into another riot, irrespective of the outcome on the temple-mosque legal dispute. Bhagwan ke naam pe roti chalti hain (In the name of God, we are earning), he said, confident that residents would not dare let tensions get out of handeven if outsiders tried to ruffle feathers.We dont think that way anymorewe cant afford to, said Pandey. The last time we suffered so badly, we caught our ears and said, never again.(Saldanha is an assistant editor with IndiaSpend.

From up there they can see what we cant see from here, one soldier speculated as a huge blaze erupted sending thick black smoke into the air.The wind lifted ash from the fire, and it danced down through the air, landing among the forces waiting to enter the airport.Finally, the road was ready, and a convoy of Rapid Response armoured cars began moving slowly north towards the sugar factory and the airport entrance opposite it.On the way they passed the dead body of an IS fighter, lying half-burned next to his motorbike.As they moved past the factory, an IED (improvised explosive device) detonated next to the convoys lead vehicle, sending soldiers running back away from the blast.No one was injured, but the soldiers began to strafe the sugar factory from several Humvees, firing round after round.CelebrationsThere are snipers inside, one soldier shouted, as those on foot took cover behind the armoured vehicles.Eventually the firing stopped, and part of the convoy broke away to move into the airport.At the entrance stood a building reduced almost entirely to rubble, with just a few pillars indicating it had once had a second floor.All around, the airport was torn up and littered with debris, with the runways virtually unrecognisable and completely unusable.From the southern edge to the northern edge, its completely destroyed, said Brigadier General Abbas al-Juburi, from the Rapid Response units.The terrorists started damaging it from the first moment the operation (to take Mosul) began.Inside, sapper units worked to locate IEDs, with one policeman hunched over with his face inches from the ground as he paced slowly forward, looking for warning signs.While he worked, others celebrated. On the road outside, a group of soldiers grinned broadly in front of their Humvee as they posed for a selfie.One held a black IS flag, brought along for the purpose, turned upside down as a gesture of defiance."

But as it goes to vote on Saturday, this constituency could present a bouquet of thorns for politicians.The fields of Sikanderpur assembly constituency in eastern UPs Ballia district once used to spread fragrance of different flowers  roses, jasmine (Juhi, Chameli) ) and kewda. Fragrance of gulab jal (rose water) once overpowered the foul smell emanating from drains.Horticulture made Sikanderpur a famous centre for perfumes of gulab and kewda, jasmine oil, rose oil and attar. Farmers who cultivated them in acres after acres are now wary.We have scaled down flower cultivation. There is no return now, said Sheodas Rajbhar, who used to grow rose, bela and chameli. The scaling down had an immediate impact on perfume manufacturing. Sikanderpur, which had more than a dozen factories, is left with only two units.The farmers are angry as no political party has taken up their issues, nor has the government showed interest in its revival.It was a good business for us. Bur after the closure of factories, my two brothers left for Gujarat while I stayed back and make ends meet somehow by selling fruits, said Subhash Kumar Paswan of Sisotar village.Nearly 70% of cultivable land in the area was under flower cultivation earlier. But unfortunately, the government never brought in any new technology or innovation, said Ajay Tiwari, who switched over to farming of sugarcane, wheat and paddy.The main reason, says Ram Narayan Gupta, a retired havildar major, is the price. Sattidars (middlemen) purchase roses at Rs.300 per kg, which they sell to mill owners at a profit of Rs.200-300 per kg and the mill owner earns between Rs.3,000 and Rs.15,000 per kg."

IMD issues another updated forecast in June.He said rainfall will be 96% of the long-period average with a margin of 5% error. India defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season.There is a 38% probability that the monsoon will be better than 96%, he added.The forecast is critical to the governments hopes of achieving a projected growth rate of more than 7.5% as a good harvest could lift rural incomes and boost spending on consumer goods.Two-thirds of Indias population depends on farm income and nearly 60% of summer sown areas do not have assured irrigation. Summer crops account for nearly half of Indias food output, including rice, lentils, sugar, spices, mangoes and oilseeds.The monsoon rains arrive on the southern tip of Kerala state by around June 1 and retreat from the western state of Rajasthan by September-end.There are fears that an emerging El Nio could impact monsoon rains. The IMD, however, said a weak El Nio could emerge only towards the later part of the year.El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, is a weather glitch marked by an abnormal warming of the Pacific, whose effects ripple around the globe. Typically, it cuts rainfall in South Asia, including India, and triggers flooding in western US and South America.Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency predicted a weaker than normal monsoon this year, citing the influence of El Nio.Even if there is an evolving El Nino it will impact the rainfall patterns, said Jatin Gandhi of Skymet which has forecast 95% monsoon rain.It is the same forecast, different only by a percent, Gandhi said. They (IMD) are saying normal with a 38% chance of moving towards near normal, I am saying 95% with a 50% chance of normal.If you are lucky you will hit normal, Gandhi said.A US government weather forecaster earlier this month projected the possibility of El Nio developing later this year.Forecasters in Japan and Australia also see a 40-50 percent chance of the El Nino weather pattern developing later this year.The IMD has a chequered record when it comes to predicting the monsoon. In the past three years, its initial forecast have consistently overestimated the average rainfall. However, the margin of the error has reduced.Last year, the IMD predicted 106% of the LPA in April though actual rainfall was 97%.We had very good rainfall and good agriculture output (in 2016), DS Pai, a scientist at IMD, said of last years monsoon.(With agency inputs)"

He had also served as Governor of Maharashtra.The bypolls are scheduled to be be held on April 9. The Nanjangud seat fell vacant after the resignation of veteran Congress leader V Srinivas Prasad in December 2016 as he was disgruntled with the Congress after he was dropped from Siddaramaiahs cabinet. Prasad later joined the BJP.The Gundlupet seat fell vacant after the death of MLA H C Mahadeva Prasad on January 3, who was Cooperation and Sugar Minister.Yeddyurappa said he would be in New Delhi tomorrow to attend an internal party meeting."
58ff0cfb7be9e0429666cf59,Captain Amarinder Singh to take oath as Punjab chief minister on March 16,http://www.hindustantimes.com/assembly-elections/captain-amarinder-singh-to-take-oath-as-punjab-chief-minister-on-march-16/story-bSxjUhkRxAQPUJPjQ3OmVP.html,2017-03-12,"The grand celebrations at the New Moti Bagh Palace on Saturday after Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh won the seat and the state on his 75th birthday were for the people of Patiala. The Congress is preparing for a grand Holi at Chandigarh on Monday before Amarinder is formally sworn in as chief minister for the second time on March 16.The party is hosted every year by Amarinders confidant and Punjabs richest MLA, sugar baron Rana Gurjit Singh, at Chandigarh. Though Rana had drawn flak for holding grand celebrations even when the Congress had lost in the 2012 polls, this time there is every reason for the party to celebrate. Its dry run in Punjab polls has finally ended and that too with a thumping victory, which has left even Congress leaders wondering at the hows and whats.But before the celebrations, the party put into motion the process for forming the next government in the state. After reaching Chandigarh from Patiala on Sunday afternoon, Amarinder was unanimously elected as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) at the Congress Bhavan here in presence of partys emissaries  former Rajasthan CM and head of Congress screening committee for Punjab elections Ashok Gehlot, AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab, Asha Kumari and AICC secretary Harish Chaudhary.Later, Amarinder, accompanied by Gehlot, Kumari and Chaudhary, went to Raj Bhavan to meet Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore and formally staked his claim to form the next government. The swearing-in ceremony will take place here on Thursday, March 16, at 10am.Though as CM this time, Amarinder wont have to look over his shoulder as the party high command has been further weakened by poll drubbing in UP and Uttarakhand and the Gandhis need him more than ever before, Amarinder, after meeting the Punjab governor, said the size and ministers of cabinet would be decided after his meeting with Rahul on Tuesday.Going by internal party dynamics, Amarinder is far more well placed in 2017 than he was in 2002, the first time he became the CM. For one, he had ensured a majority of the tickets went to his loyalists. So the CLP is packed with his loyalists and even the partys three senior-most leaders are now out of the way.He had debarred his prickly rival and former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal from changing her seat, Lehra, where she was facing four-term anti-incumbency by bringing in the no swap rule for sitting MLAs on general seats.Former leader of opposition Sunil Jakhar who was sulking after Amarinder did not bat for his Rajya Sabha nomination, too has lost his bastion, Abohar. Amarinders other rule of one family, one ticket kept another potential power centre, Lal Singh, out of the poll race. Lals son, Rajinder Singh, has won the Samana seat.Though Fatehjang Bajwa, the younger brother of his other bitter critic, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Bajwa, has won, he poses no threat of dissidence to Amarinder.Now there only loyalists in the new CLP. The only question would be of who is more loyal. But in his last term as CM, Amarinder is not likely to play the favourites card. He will go by merit and seniority while trying a balance between factors of caste, religion, gender and region as he has won on the promise of good governance, a senior party leader said.Sidhu as deputy CM?Though Amarinder said the decision to appoint a deputy CM rests with the party high command, the party circles were abuzz with speculation that Navjot Singh Sidhu would be sworn in as Amarinders deputy. The other prominent portfolio of finance is likely to go to former finance minister Manpreet Badal.Some senior ministers in the race for cabinet berths on basis of region, caste and religion arithmetic are Tripat Singh Bajwa (Jat Sikh, Majha), Aruna Chaudhary (Hindu, woman, Majha), Brahm Mohindra (Hindu, Malwa), Charanjit Singh Channi (Dalit, Malwa), Pargat Singh (Jat Sikh, Doaba), Sukhbinder Sarkaria (Jat Sikh, Majha), Razia Sultana (Muslim, woman, Malwa), Amarinder and Kuljit Nagra (Rahuls confidant, Jat Sikh, Malwa)."

It is foggy and their teeth are chattering, but they remain rooted to the spot in grim determination.After all, they are Akali supporters, and its not every day that they get to see their icon  Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal  in the flesh.But still, the rally organisers are anxious because most of the chairs laid out at the venue are empty. They ask the usually punctual Badal to come a little late, hoping to garner a respectable crowd by then. The strategy pays off. When the chief ministers Toyota Land Cruiser rolls in 35 minutes later, the place is packed to the brim.Badal, who is here to campaign for sitting Akali MLA Parkash Chand Garg, is welcomed with a siropa (a garment bestowed upon a person as a mark of honour). After a few customary speeches, it is his turn to speak.It doesnt start well. Even as the chief minister takes the mike, a small group of people starts shouting slogans and waving black flags at him. Policemen deployed at the venue swing into action, shooing them out in a matter of minutes.However, the 89-year-old political warhorse remains unperturbed. He dismisses the slogan-shouting bunch as troublemakers who know nothing else, and then goes on to launch a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). This is a war between vikas (development) and vinash (destruction). Peace and brotherhood are on one side, and disruptive forces are on the other. AAP leaders tell people to throw stones and disrupt our meetings. They have links with people who create trouble and disturb peace. Strengthening such a party will be a sin, he thunders.Badal accuses AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal of promoting his own political interests, and doing nothing for people from the state. Kejriwal is also the Delhi chief minister. Delhi has a huge population of Punjabis, but there is not a single Punjabi minister in his government, he says.The chief minister then targets the Congress, which  according to him  let down the people of Punjab in both political and religious matters. They divided Sikhs and Hindus, snatched our capital (Chandigarh) and tried to take our water. When (then Prime Minister) Indira Gandhi performed the ground-breaking ceremony of the SYL canal, Amarinder was present. Duja jeda hai, woh Dilli aala, kehnda hai Punjab da paani, saare Hindustan da hai (Kejriwal claims he belongs to Punjab and whole India). He is from Haryana... he was born there. We have to save Punjab from them, he tells the gathering, alleging that people who indulged in violence over the Guru Granth Sahib desecration enjoyed political patronage.Badal then adopts a preachy tone, presenting himself and the SAD-BJP alliance as the sole protectors of peace. The crowd doesnt sound impressed. But when he moves on to listing the sops announced in his manifesto  ghee, sugar, gas stoves and pressure cookers  loud cheers break out.We will deliver on our promises. Keep away from AAP and Congress, because both these parties are gapod shanks (blabbermouths), he advises the people, winding up the 28-minute speech.Playing the Punjabiyat cardThe five-time chief minister is addressing three election rallies a day, toiling hard to battle the strong undercurrent of anti-incumbency his party faces. While age may have slowed him down, Badals speeches retain their sarcasm in election campaigns marked by mud-slinging, taunts and threats.Punjabi identity is the common thread that runs through his speeches, apart from attempts to kindle some righteous Sikh anger by reminding the people of the excesses committed by the Congress in the past  especially Operation Bluestar.Badals next halt is at a local dana mandi (grain market) in Dirba, where the Akali Dal has fielded kabaddi player Gulzar Singh. The crowd that has gathered here is impressive. Welcomed with loud cheers, an elated Badal begins by thanking the people for turning up in such large numbers. Then he moves on to praise the partys candidate in the constituency. Gulzar sone di dali hai (Gulzar is a gold bar). I have seen him play many matches in the Kabaddi Olympics. He will win gold in political kabaddi as well, says Badal.While both AAP and the Congress find themselves at the receiving end, the rookie party bears the brunt of Badals barbs. Hitting out at Kejriwal and his supporters for hurting religious sentiments by featuring the broom  its party symbol  alongside a picture of the Golden Temple on its manifesto, he says: They have no understanding of Sikh ethos. They only want to mislead the people and come to power.Next, Badals cavalcade heads out to Moonak in Lehra, an impregnable fortress of the Congress, for his last public meeting of the day. In this assembly segment, former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal is pitted against Punjab finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa  also described as sone di dali by Badal.There can be no candidate better than him. When a government is formed, the most capable person gets the finance (ministry), the chief minister says, before moving on to blast his political rivals.The Congress has hurt the interests of Punjab. AAP khumbi ji ug gayi (AAP has come up like a mushroom). If such people come to power, where will they take Punjab? No one trusts them. They remind me of tutte je (ramshackle) trucks on roads with old bodies and worn-out tyres, but have Chal baliye tera rab hi rakha (Girl, God will take care of you) written on their backsides, he says, drawing loud guffaws from his supporters.With this, Badal wraps up his agenda for the day. But then, with the election slated to be held on February 4, he can afford no rest until victory is attained. Or not."

The CBI investigation revealed that shots were fired from revolver number 161-24871 of .38 bore, which was issued to Belur.Belur was not named in the chargesheet but the Ghaziabad court had summoned her under section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) as an accused on September 14, 2007.The ballistic expert has also opined that the second bullet recovered from the body of Jasbir Singh was fired from the revolver issued in the name of Smt Jyoti Belur, then ASP Modi Nagar. She was not present at the spot when (A-1) Lal Singh fired at Jasbir Singh, according to the eyewitnesses, the CBI chargesheet stated.While narrating about the rounds fired by the personnel in the sugarcane field, convict Lal Singh had stated in the FIR that the Belur had fired three rounds. He also mentioned names of other officers and the rounds fired by them.Belur had moved Allahabad high court in a criminal revision petition against the September 14, 2007, summons issued by the special judge (CBI). Belur was summoned to face the trial for the offences punishable under sections 193, 201 and 302 of IPC.Her petition, filed in 2010 through lawyers, maintained that no case was made against her. No case for summoning the revisionist said to be made out. The court below has erred in relying upon the deposition of P.W.-7 (prosecution witness) Mukim who has not said a single word in respect of the revisionist (Belur). The depositions of P.W.-17 and P.W.-26 also do not reflect the involvement of the revisionist, the court had stated.The trial court has ignored the fact that at the time of taking the cognizance, the ballistic expert opinion was a part of the record but no cognizance was taken against the revisionist. The court has acted arbitrarily because, after the examinations of 61 prosecution witnesses and court witness, the revisionist has been summoned, it stated.However, the court order mentions the CBI reply, which stated, Learned court below has taken into consideration the statements of prosecution witnesses P.W.-7 Mukim, P.W.17 Randheer Singh, P.W.-26 Chaman Singh, P.W.-29 Navin, P.W.-30 Chandrapal, P.W.-32 Sri Abhijeet, P.W.- 55 Ram Chand and has come to the conclusion that the Revolver No.161-24871 of .38 bore was with the revisionist.Belurs petition was dismissed by the court in 2013. She had filed a recall application but it was also dismissed by the high court in 2013. She later approached the Supreme Court but her petition was rejected. However, Belur has failed to appear at court.She is an accused in the case and proceedings can only begin once she appears at the court. The court has also issued non-bailable warrants against her. We will try for her extradition from the UK, Rajan Dahiya, public prosecutor, CBI, said."

He was in a drunken state and when the woman raised an alarm, he fled the spot.However, he was summoned to a panchayat on February 14, where he was forced to stand on one leg, was beaten up, and made to drink urine. The incident came to light only on Friday, when the victims wife filed a complaint with the police.Officiating senior superintendent of police Salmantaj Patil had, on Friday, ordered Bhojpur police to immediately register an FIR. Although the police have been tight-lipped about the panchayat or the incident, locals revealed more chilling details on Saturday.There were nearly 100-125 people assembled at the panchayat, held opposite the house of one Puran. Amit, his wife, parents, uncle and brothers were present. The victim stood on one leg before the panchayat for nearly an hour and repeatedly apologised for the mistake. Amit and his brothers slapped him. Later, the victims aunt beat him up with sugarcane. His uncle too joined her, said Chiranji Lal, a villager.Chiranji Lal said that later, Amits wife came up with her slippers and hit him with it. Then too, the victim was apologising. He was made to write a mafinama (apology letter), in which he said that he is sorry for the mistake and will not be seen in the locality post evening. After this, Amit brought a bottle containing urine. He claimed that the urine was of himself and his wife. The bottle was half full. Four to five people from his family held the victim and forced the content to his mouth, he said.Chaman Kumar, another villager, said that Amit and family had filled the bottle beforehand and brought to the gathering.Amit said iski nazar nahi uthane denge (We will not allow him to raise his eyes). Several people from his neighbours family grabbed him and forced urine to his mouth. No one got time to save him. No one came forward as it was urine. Ever since the incident, he has left his house and is staying with some relative, Chaman said.Locals said that following the incident, the victim had run to his house and tried to set himself afire, which was thwarted by his neighbours. Unable to face the humiliation, the victim and his family have fled their house.Meanwhile, Amits family had lodged a complaint against the man after he peeped into the house on February 10. The complaint alleged that he had come with an intention of theft.Chaman said that when the humiliated victim attempted suicide, Amits family had rang up the police station and informed them that the thief had come. When police arrived and were apprised of the incident, they beat the perpetrators of the incident instead and said that an FIR would be lodged against them, he said.Police have arrested Amit and three others namely Rajvir, Deepu and Vikas, in the case."

The documents in the case suggest that the convicts faked the second part of the encounter, for which they had sought police reinforcements through their internal communication system.The four victims, Jalaluddin, Ashok, Pravesh and Jasbir, were gunned down on the afternoon of November 8, 1996, the day of Dhanteras festival. The UP police, in the initial FIR, had stated that they gunned down two badmash (goons) on the road while two, hiding in the nearby sugarcane fields, were gunned down in retaliatory firing.According to the 1996 FIR, the encounter ensued near Machli Bazar, popularly known as Macheri ki Puliya, around 3.30pm when a police party led by Bhojpur station house officer (SHO) Lal Singh was on its way in a jeep accompanying four (different) accused for recovery of arms in a different case.Lal Singh had stated that the police party spotted four youngsters en route and asked them to stop, but they hid among trees and opened fire on the police party.They took cover in trenches and trees, and fired two rounds at the police with an intention to kill, but we were saved. We sat down and took up (attack) position despite the danger to our lives. The badmash (goons) fired twice and one bullet zoomed past my ear. Then, I crawled while moving forward and fired four shots from my revolver, Lal Singh had stated in the FIR.He had further stated that constables Ranbir fired five rounds from his carbine, Surya Bhan fired four rounds from his Sten gun and Subhash Chand fired three rounds from his rifle, which finally killed two.Hearing the firing, the jeep driver sent messages from the police radio-talkie set to the Bhojpur and Modi Nagar police for reinforcements. A team led by then Modi Nagar circle officer Jyoti Belur, and another team led by OP Sagar, superintendent of police (rural - SPRA), came to their aid.The FIR further states that around 5pm, the police force, on the directions of SPRA and the ASP entered the thick sugarcane fields nearly 9-10 steps when the badmash opened fire again. On this, the police party, despite peril to their lives, showed exemplary courage and opened fire in retaliation in the direction where movements of the goons were heard. The badmash fired again but the firing stopped after some time... the FIR stated.The police had claimed to have recovered weapons from the four persons. Nearly all the officials, including the SPRA, ASP, SHO, station officers and constables had fired rounds from their respective weapons, which included revolvers, rifles, carbine and deadly AK-47s.A total of five cases were registered that were investigated by MP Singh, then inspector of Hapur police station and a case closure report was filed on January 21, 1997, at the Ghaziabad court.However, under public pressure and political intervention, the case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The agencys investigation revealed that the four victims were in Pilkhuwa looking for jobs and were sitting at a tea stall opposite the Bhojpur police station. The four were called inside and were taken in a police jeep towards Modi Nagar.The jeep stopped near Macheri ki pulia around 3.30pm where Surya Bhan, Ranbir Singh and Subhash Chand pulled Jalaluddin from the jeep. Lal Singh pushed him and opened fire at him. Jalaluddin died after suffering a rifle shot, fired by Subhash Chand. Lal Singh then fired at Jasbir Singh.Meanwhile, Joginder Singh, a sub-inspector from Bhojpur police station, reached the spot on a scooter with countrymade weapons, kattas. These were planted near the bodies of Jasbir and Jalaluddin after firing one round from each.The police then entered the sugarcane fields and fired a few rounds. Chander Pal, a friend of Lal Singh from Bhojpur village, arrived at the spot and was allowed to enter the fields. He saw the dead bodies of two others, Ashok and Pravesh. He also found police breaking the sugarcane around the bodies.That before the arrival of Jyoti Belur, ASP and OP Sagar, SPRA, and other officers, the four deceased were thus found shot at, injured and dead, the CBI chargesheet stated.During the post-mortem examination, Dr SC Aggarwal found that Jasbir had sustained two shots, Jalaluddin, five, Ashok, two and Pravesh, five. All four had suffered injuries to their chest while Ashok, Jalaluddin and Pravesh had bullet marks on their heads as well, just above the ear."

The crowd breaks into smiles and cheers him on. His tone changes to casual, as he pulls out the Punjabi-versus-outsider card: Yaar dekho. Changay haan, maade haan, tuhade apne haan (We might be good or bad, but belong to you).People gather to take a selfie with Sukhbir Badal. (HT Photo)But what really gets the crowd going is when Sukhbir begins to announce his party manifesto. Loan waiver, bonus on minimum support price (MSP), subsidised ghee and sugar, government jobs  every promise invites a loud applause. Fifteen minutes later, as the speech ends, many in the audience get up from their chairs, shouting slogans: Kejriwal-Panja jamna paar, teeji vaar Badal sarkar (Kejriwal and Congress will be thrown across the Yamuna; Badals will form the government for third consecutive time). As Sukhbir leaves the stage, youngsters rush to the front, mobbing him to take selfies. He indulges some, smiling into their mobile phones, before his Z-plus security prompts him to move.We are winning this seat, he says, while effortlessly climbing the rather high lone step into the chopper. And how do you know that? A party whose workers are charged up like this cannot lose. They are the soldiers. If they make it as much as their fight as mine, then my work is done.Taking on all oddsConsidered to be a highly effective election micro manager who created history with back-to-back victories in 2007 and 2012, Sukhbir is aware of every odd stacked against him this time.That is the whole thrill of the fight. To have everything against you to begin with and then come out victorious, he says with a smile. I tell the candidates: win the game in your mind first. Work till the very end. No seat is lost or won till the last vote is cast.If Sukhbir is expected to be tense, he is certainly not showing it, dressed in a white kurta-pyjama with the blue Akali turban and matching coat. As the helicopter lifts off, he settles comfortably in his seat and in less than a minute his eyes shut to catch a power nap before the next stop: Chabbewal in Hoshiarpur. As an animated discussion begins with his media adviser on AAPs election prospects, it becomes clear sleep is a luxury for the Akali chief. Unlike what you journalists think, AAP is in the fight on only 25 seats in Malwa and a lone or couple each in Majha and Doaba. Akalis and Congress are in direct two-way contest on majority of the seats in Punjab, says Sukhbir with an air of finality.But you are hitting out more at AAP in your speeches. That is because they are the worst set of people  for not just Punjab, but for the country. They are anarchists, who believe in destroying institutions, systems, and not in building them.But what happens if AAP comes to power in Punjab? Are you worried they will arrest you, like they go around promising? Are you joking? They are thoroughly corrupt, have made crores from sale of election tickets. I will be putting them behind bars.Read | AAP not our key opponent in elections, says Sukhbir BadalFour rallies later, as the sun begins to set and Sukhbir shifts from the chopper to his car, it is a slow, salubrious drive from Sham Chaurasi (venue of the last rally) in Hoshiarpur to Jalandhar. Where is my lunch? he remembers. His embarrassed staff has no clue. A quick stop and steaming pakodas are passed to him on a newspapers front page. These are good. The foodie offers us some.Sukhbir Badal having pakodas for lunch on his way from Sham Chaurasi to Jalandhar on Saturday. (HT Photo)I enjoy these months more than the five years of being in power! He is running on what he describes his favourite mode  election-charged. I am thinking all the time. I barely sleep. After the rallies I hold meetings till wee hours. That is when the backroom strategising is done. And what is the strategy to ensure the hat-trick he promises to his men? I wouldnt tell you that! he laughs."

In Gurdaspur, where hes from, he says the families of fallen soldiers have been given a raw deal. The widows of those martyred in last years terror attack in Pathankot  the border town where hes headed  are still running from pillar to post for their compensation, he claims.Driving his truck through the electorally significant Doaba region, Sukhbir and his assistant, Gagandeep, survey a landscape that, they say, has been chronically maladministered.As the winter morning breeze makes the cabin colder, the two get agitated in tandem, recounting their litany of woes in poll-bound Punjab.The son of an ex-army man, Sukhbir is a class 12th pass out. His immediate surrounding never held out hope and he is employed as a low-paid helper in a truck and gets to drive occasionally when the driver opts to take rest.Driven by despair, many in his village have left: his younger brother Jaspreet is waiting for a medical test before he can attempt to go abroad.Sukhbir has no means to escape the dreary existence, and hopes that the assembly elections on February 4 will change things for the better for people like him.He and Gagandeep differ on the possible outcome of the polls. Gagandeep feels the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will win. Sukhbir is not so sure which of the two  AAP or Congress  will emerge victorious, though he agrees that the Badals will lose due to anger against the ruling family.Truck tales part 1 | Punjab election: Who are the truckers voting for?The two men, however, agree on one thing  Punjab desperately requires a surgical strike to set right the wrongs. And both feel that residents of Doaba  the region with 23 seats  will determine Punjabs future course in great measure.A large number of AAP supporters from abroad have begun campaigning in Doaba, also famous as the NRI belt.Sukhbir, on the contrary, says the Congress led by Captain Amarinder Singh has an edge. The party had won 6 of the 23 seats in 2012 and hopes to improve its tally. It has fielded sugar baron Rana Gurjit Singh  Punjabs richest candidate  from Kapurthala.The duo pulls up at a roadside dhaba in Machiwara for lunch and other drivers join them in an animated discussion on the polls, spicing up the food on the table.Manjeet Singh, 47, a trucker for 26 years, is angry with the Badals, so much so that he blames the ruling family for taking credit for roads built by the Union government.A government driver is paid Rs 20,000 and a private driver barely makes half that amount despite working for 24 hours. We also have children to raise. We want change too, no matter who comes to power, he says.Deep in Doaba, drug abuse is an issue thats topping the election agenda alongside unemployment. Most of its residents blame the administration for the festering menace.Why do drivers have to depend on drugs to travel in the night. The demand will decrease if the supply is reduced, suggests Gagandeep as Sukhbir gets the documents and the vehicle checked at a check post.As the truck travels past a police training camp in Jalandhar, the conversation between the two turns to corruption and nepotism.Punjabis either want to do farming or join the army or police force. Under Badal rule, even a 7-ft high candidate is not selected while a 5-ft gets a job in police, just because he is close to the ruling family, Sukhbir says as the truck crosses the toll plaza at Tanda.The issues confronting Doaba have been crying out for redressal since long. Politicians and their parties have promised solutions in the past but failed to deliver, resulting in voter fatigue.Nearly 400 km into their journey stretching 23 hours, both Gagandeep and Sukhbir are visibly tired. An agreement still eludes them on who will win. Then they decide to let it go: Ki farq painda paaji. Chalani to truck hi hai na (How does it matter who comes to power. We will continue to drive trucks anyway, Sukhbir sighed, as Pathankot neared."

The post-Partition face of the Indian Muslims, Maulana Azad, was keen to contest an election from a constituency with a sizeable Hindu population to prove his secular credentials when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru insisted he contest from Muslim-majority Rampur district instead. Nehru didnt want to take a risk with the electoral fortunes of one of his key lieutenants. A reluctant Azad eventually agreed, and although he managed to have his way by contesting from Gurgaon in the 1957 elections, the die had been cast: a Muslim politician in UP was seen to need the crutches of his co-religionists to win an election.Azad at least had the stature to be seen as a genuine ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. Azam Khan, the Samajwadi Partys (SP) most-prominent Muslim face and its MLA from Rampur, typifies a dangerous brand of aggressive Muslim-first politics masquerading as secularism. His strident rhetoric is designed to consciously appeal to his Muslim constituency: Rather than speak of how he intends to lift the community from the morass of under-development, his focus is on stoking their worst fears and insecurities. In the Azam Khan worldview, the way to win elections is to portrait Narendra Modi as an ogre, someone Muslims should be very frightened of.Read: My India My Vote: Uttar PradeshAnd yet, despite his abominable public utterances (one of the worst was when he suggested that the Kargil war was won by Muslim soldiers), the SP has chosen to stick with Khan because it suits their political agenda of wooing the states 18% Muslim vote. The partys original vote bank was built in the early 1990s on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, with Mulayam Singhs shoot-at-sight orders against kar sevaks at the height of the Ram Mandir movement conferring him the honorific Maulana Mulayam. The standing joke in Lucknow was that if any influential Muslim cleric approached Mulayam, he would be rewarded with an official post.Truth is, the SP has failed to offer the UP Muslim genuine security or social uplift: Patronage of Muslim elites or donations to madrasas have had almost no impact on the lives of citizens. The numerous small and large riots that have occurred in UP in the last five years are indictments of the claim to have ensured communal peace: The worst example being the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots where the local administration clearly failed to act swiftly or in a non-partisan manner.Perhaps, sensing an opportunity, the BSP leader Mayawati has attempted to challenge the MY alliance with her own DM (Dalit-Muslim) social engineering. By giving tickets to 100 Muslims including mafia dons like Mukhtar Ansari, Mayawati has made an attempt to break the Yadav stranglehold over the Muslim vote. There have been previous attempts to create a Dalit-Muslim unity, most notably in Maharashtra, but never has it been tried on the scale that Mayawati is now seeking. It is this fear of a divided Muslim vote rather than any principled commitment to secular values that has spurred the Samajwadi-Congress alliance.Read: UP elections: Why a hung assembly cant be ruled out in this battleground stateThe BJPs response is even more troubling. Despite the PMs promise of sabka saath, sabka vikaas, on the ground there has been a concerted attempt by the local BJP leadership to identify issues that will create a Hindu-Muslim polarisation. If in 2014, the party exploited the Muzaffarnagar riots, this time, issues like a proposed ban on slaughter-houses, a national debate on triple talaq, the alleged flight of Hindus from Kairana in western UP, have been raked up on election eve with the sole intent of consolidating a Hindu vote. The pernicious love jihad campaign of Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and the hate speeches of BJP MPs like Sakshi Maharaj and MLAs like Sangeet Som expose their bigoted mindsets.Trapped then between the opportunistic politics of the so-called secular parties and the demonisation by Hindutva forces, the average UP Muslim voter is left feeling angry and frustrated. They dont want to embrace the self-appointed thekedars of the community like the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid who pops up just before elections despite his growing political irrelevance.They may be attracted to a more articulate leader like Asaduddin Owaisi but are also acutely aware that the Hyderabad MP is only a spoiler at election time. Indeed, if the Muslim voter prefers the SP-Congress alliance today, its because of a visible lack of options, and the fear that he will be soon left without any political voice in the state when confronted with the Sangh parivar juggernaut. Remember the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was the first when not a single Muslim was elected MP from UP.Read: Why UP matters: Can Indias most populous state decide the fate of Delhi?The answer to the Muslim dilemma does not lie in the growing radicalisation of the young who want to express themselves in more violent terms. Nor is it in seeking sops from the state, which are seen as token appeasement. It must lie, at the very core, in the recognition of the economic inter-dependence of communities: A Jat land owner in a sugarcane field in Baghpat must make common cause with the Muslim agricultural labourer as must a Muslim weaver in Banaras with a Hindu sari shop owner for mutual benefit. This can only be enabled by a leader with vision and credibility who enjoys the trust of both communities: Uttar Pradesh is crying out for a 21st century Azad and Nehru.Post script: In the aftermath of the post-Ayodhya riots, Lucknow was remarkably free of any bloody communal conflict. An elderly gent explained it to me with a poetic touch: In this city, Hindu and Muslim are like taala and chabi (lock and key), one cannot do without the other.What Lucknow thinks today, hopefully India will think tomorrow.The writer is senior journalist and authorrajdeepsardesai52@gmail.com"

As such, the proposals are expected to have a huge captive market.S Sidharth, principal secretary, industries department, said, Several proposals for rice mills and units based on fly ash have also been cleared. It is indicative of entrepreneurs desire to be present in sectors where the demand exists and has a potential to grow.The state is set to have a huge supply of fly ash as by-product from thermal power units, both the existing ones and several new units coming up. Similarly, five projects for manufacturing LPG cylinders and setting up LPG bottling plant also came up for consideration, apparently to tap the potential thrown open by the Centres Ujjwala scheme.A Rs 97-crore ethanol project of Majhaulia Sugar Industries Pvt Ltd was also cleared. It aims to take advantage of revised ethanol off-take policy of the Centre to encourage its blending with petrol in excess of 10% benchmark.A project aiming to leverage Bihars maize producing capacity as a summer crop came in the form of a starch manufacturing plant at Thakurganj by a Kolkata-based company and another, for hallmarked jewellery, by Ankur Jewellers, were also cleared.We have been able to take up all online applications submitted till January 11 for consideration. From now on, the SIPB will be holding regular meetings every month, Sidharth said.A decision on a Rs 304 crore investment proposal by United Breweries for producing malt-based alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, was held back for lack of clarity.Alcoholic beverage is in the negative list, Sidharth said, adding proposals for several stone crushing units had been put on hold and asked to explain whether they have requisite lease license for the same.Online application facility has introduced greater transparency and done away with chances of anybody jumping the queue at the last moment. SMS and e-mail would be sent to 109 entrepreneurs whose projects have been approved.Stage 1 approval will be followed by stage 2 clearance at the principal secretary level, for projects up to Rs 2.5 crore and at the ministers level for up to Rs 10 crore projects, while Rs 10-20 crore worth of projects will be approved jointly by finance and industries minister.Anything above it would go to the cabinet.Stage 3 will see time bound approvals within 30 days by concerned departments or lead to deemed approval by principal secretary, industries, while the last stage clearance at the production level would entitle a unit to claim post production subsidy."

""It is UP which made me the Prime Minister,"" Modi said, adding that he wanted to repay its debt and that he can do it only with a government that joins hands with the Centre to develop the state unlike the current dispensation which is a ""hindrance"" in its progress.Attacking Congress and Samajwadi Party, he said Congress ran a campaign against the Samajwadi Party government and wondered as to what happened that both have now joined hands. ""What happened that overnight they are embracing each. Those who could not save themselves cannot save UP,"" he said. Wooing farmers, he reiterated the party's promise of waiving loans of small and marginal farmers and paying the dues of sugarcane growers within 14 days of coming to power.Playing the pro-poor and pro-farmers card, a plank BJP has assiduously tried to claim for some time, Modi said the recent budget was all about them besides the middle class. Noting that the rebellion against the British rule in 1857 had started from Meerut, Modi said he has chosen this place to start the war against poverty, corrupt forces and land grabbers. The Prime Minister again attacked the opposition parties over demonetisation and surgical strikes to strike a chord with the audience as he said he was determined to cleanse the system at the top and was not interested in small fights.""Those who filled rooms with currency notes collected by selling party tickets are very anguished as I forced them to deposit their money in banks with an announcement at 8 PM on November 8.... ""I knew they will all gang up against me. They will kick up a storm because Modi has robbed them and they will bring him down.""Do you think that corruption should be ended and black money finished off? I have been doing this and will not rest nor will let these robbers rest. No matter how many of them gang up to oppose me, my fight will not stop. Modi will not stop,"" he said. Targeting Congress, he said a minister in the party-run Karnataka government has been found in possession of Rs 150 crore and but it has not taken any action against him.Targeting Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, he said first his concern was all about family, then about himself and now it is about the chair. Those accused of running mine mafia, patronising criminals, rapists and land-grabbers have been given tickets in SP, he alleged."

58ff1a4a7be9e04136162763,"Litchi, mystery fruit behind Bihar deaths",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594490/litchi-mystery-fruit-behind-bihar.html,2017-02-02,"By Ellen Barry, Feb 3, 2017, INYT 23:49 ISTChildren awakened with a high-pitch cry in the early morning. Then the youths began having seizures and slipping into comas. In about 40% of cases, they died.Three years ago, Dr Rajesh Yadav, an investigator with the India Epidemic Intelligence Service, moved to the city of Muzaffarpur, Bihar, the site of one of the countrys most mysterious outbreaks. And he waited.Every year in mid-May, as temperatures reached scorching heights, parents took children who had been healthy the night before to the hospital. The children awakened with a high-pitch cry in the early morning, many parents said.Then the youths began having seizures and slipping into comas. In about 40% of cases, they died. Every year in July, with the arrival of monsoon rains, the outbreak ended as suddenly as it began.Beginning in 1995, investigations variously ascribed the phenomenon to heat stroke; to infections carried by rats, bats or sand flies; or to pesticides used in the regions ubiquitous litchi orchards. But there were few signposts for investigators. Instead of occurring in clusters, the illness typically struck only one child in a village, often leaving even siblings unaffected.A joint investigation by Indias National Centre for Disease Control and the India office of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, published in the British medical journal The Lancet Global Health on Tuesday, has identified a surprising culprit: the litchi fruit itself, when eaten on an empty stomach by malnourished children.In 2015, as a result of the investigation, health officials began urging parents in the area to be sure to feed young children an evening meal and to limit their consumption of litchis. In two seasons, the number of reported cases per year dropped to less than 50 from hundreds.It was an unexplained illness for so many years, said Padmini Srikantiah, a senior epidemiologist with the CDC and the senior author of the paper. This is kind of emblematic of why we collaborate, to build this kind of systematic approach.The Lancet article walks through a two-year medical detective story, as epidemiologists like Yadav closely examined the lives of hundreds of afflicted children, trying to understand everything they had eaten, drunk and breathed.It was a very intense situation, because we witnessed children dying in front of our eyes every day, as soon as they arrived at the hospital, said Yadav, who now works with the CDC in Atlanta.Especially difficult were the detailed interviews of parents, many of whom had carried a convulsing or comatose child for hours to get to the hospital. They were in a kind of panic, he said. Their children were dying, and it was an unknown thing. The first clue: There was no evidence the children had infections.For 20 years, clinicians were unable to determine if the disease, which led to acute brain swelling known as encephalopathy, was caused by an infection  the immediate assumption in many outbreaks here.Investigators pored over records from the previous years outbreak and were struck by the fact that many of the sick children did not have a fever. Analysis of spinal fluid samples overwhelmingly showed that the affected children did not have elevated counts of white blood cells, a sign the body is fighting infection. The second clue: Most of the victims had very low blood sugar levels.Having collected biological samples from more than 300 children, the researchers were able to scan a large number of markers  including some they hadnt suspected.Glucose had never been a particular concern for investigators. But some of the affected children had strikingly low levels, and those with low blood glucose were twice as likely to die, Srikantiah said.It seemed to be a little signal, she continued. One of the things we heard multiple times from the childrens mothers was that they didnt really eat dinner properly. The third clue: Outbreaks had been associated with the ackee fruit.It was in the fall of 2013, during a conference call with colleagues in Atlanta, that someone mentioned Jamaican vomiting sickness, an outbreak in the West Indies that for many decades caused brain swelling, convulsions and altered mental states in children.Deadly toxinThe outbreak turned out to be tied to hypoglycin, a toxin found in the ackee fruit that inhibits the bodys ability to synthesise glucose, leading to acute hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose levels.It had been going on for a decade, if not a century, before people really figured out what it was, Srikantiah said. Now, the grandmothers and the mothers teach their kids, Dont eat the unripe ackee fruit. By late 2014, laboratory tests confirmed that litchis also contain high levels of hypoglycin, as well as a similar toxin known as methylenecyclopropyl glycine, or MCPG.This was an answer hiding in plain sight. The Muzaffarpur area produces about 70% of Indias litchi harvest, and around the affected villages, you really couldnt go 100 meters without bumping into a litchi orchard, Srikantiah said.Though orchards were typically guarded by caretakers, children often ate litchis that were unripe or that had fallen to the ground. But because everyone in the region eats them, it was difficult for many to believe that, in isolated cases, it could set off a catastrophic illness. The fourth clue: Affected children had huge metabolic imbalances.By early 2015, CDC laboratories had developed a test to measure hypoglycin in urine. They found extraordinary abnormalities in the affected children. The folks in the genetic labs said We havent seen anything like this,  Srikantiah said. This was clearly abnormal.With that established, the investigators asked participants if they would be comfortable issuing recommendations based on their findings: that young children in the affected areas be encouraged to always eat an evening meal, and that consumption of litchis should be limited. Everyone agreed. And it was done."
58ff1a5e7be9e04136162772,Jats feel 'politically untouchable',http://www.deccanherald.com/content/595180/jats-feel-politically-untouchable.html,2017-02-06,"Jats feel 'politically untouchable'Dalip Singh, Feb 7, 2017, BAGHPAT (UP), DHNS 1:28 ISTAssembly polls 2017: Uttar Pradesh gears up for 1st phase on Feb 11As he takes turns to smoke the hookah at a chaupal (village square) in Bauli village of Badhot late Sunday afternoon, wrinkled-faced Rajpal Singh says the Jats want a resurgence of their political identity.Ahead of the first phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh on February 11, Rajpal thinks that the dominant agrarian community of western Uttar Pradesh is feeling politically untouchable in the absence of a strong leadership that it could relate to at the state level  whether in the BJP, SP or BSP.The veteran farmers views echo in the two adjoining Jat-dominated villages of Rustampur and Mahautpur, which account for 12,000 votes.Their once leader Chaudhary Ajit Singh of the RLD is fighting hard to regain his place in Jat politics after his partys humbling performance in the 2012 Assembly elections. His hold slipped further two years later, leading to the former Union minister himself losing Bagpat in the Lok Sabha polls.Adding to woes is RLDs inability to join the SP-Congress alliance with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav putting his foot down.This has left the caste-based party to contest the triangular fight alone.The RLD, which has fielded 326 candidates for the 403-member UP Assembly, is out to inflict maximum damage to the BJP in whatever way it can, local party leader Arun Tomar, who is close to Ajits family, told DH.Given that Jats populate about 70 seats spread over some 19 districts in the state, a swing of a few percentage points in the communitys votes away form the BJP can alter equations in the election, which is being fiercely fought on caste equations.We will destroy the BJP game plan in western UP. How many seats we win is secondary, Tomar said.Though Mahautpur village pradhan Ajay Chaudhary claims that a large number of Jats would vote for the RLD to revive the party that was the undisputed flagbearer of agrarian politics during former prime minister Charan Singhs era, other community members vouch for the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Jats had voted en masse for the BJP after the communal polarisation following the Muzaffarnagar riots to help the party sweep the state with 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 elections.Ajit, in his address at a rally in Baghpat, cautions the community against the BJPs hate politics, hinting that they should not get involved in a communal flare-up, like the one which was reportedly used to garner their support in the last general election.The other thing that the farming caste feels is that the BJP has not done much with regard to the sugarcane issue  which Modi himself tried to address by saying in a Meerut rally on Saturday that he had cleared 99% of the Rs 2,200-crore compensation package due for 2014-15."

Vigilance is essential to prevent other agricultural products becoming in 2017-18 what pulses were in 2015-16, according to the Economic Survey 2016-17 tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.It said milk procurement had been low due to currency shortage and sugar supplies could be hit as drought in southern states would restrict production of cane. It pointed out that sowing for onions and potatoes had been low which could affect their supplies. The Survey, however, pegged agricultural growth at 4.1%  the same as the Central Statistical Organisation estimated  on the back of a good monsoon after two successive drought years. Last year, the farm sector grew at a dismal 1.2%.At 84%, the farm credit growth has been impressive when compared with 59% achieved by September 2015. The credit target for 2016-17 was fixed at Rs 9 lakh crore as against Rs 8.5 lakh crore set for 2015-16, it said. It pointed out the challenges facing the sector like regulation on farm trade, issues related to IPR in seeds and frequent recourse to stock limits among others creating uncertainty for farmers."

""Why it happened we don't know, except that Jayalalithaa was of mature years with chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, with recovering sepsis and an infection in the heart,"" he said.The doctors said AIADMK general secretary Sasikala and other top state officials were briefed on a daily basis about the progress in treatment. They said there was ""no political pressure"" to hold the press conference. Beale said Governor Ch Vidyasagar Roa, on his second visit, had gone into the ICU and flashed a thumbs up to Jayalalithaa which she responded to.Beale further explained that Jayalalithaa was diagnosed with Septicemia. ""Sepsis can come on extrememly quickly, and its consequences can be severe,"" he said, adding that diabetes and high blood pressure had increased her vulnerability.Dr Babu and Dr Balaji said she was ""admitted with uncontrolled diabtetes alongside septicemia and the best of treatment was given."" They, along with Beale, said that when admitted, Jayalalithaa had fever and dehydration and when evaluated, it was also found that her sugar levels were uncontrolled. She also had ""urinary infection"" and since it was ""sepsis increased"", it had ""cascading effects.""She was treated with non-invasive ventilation which involves putting a mask to the face.

""She was conscious when she put her thumb impression, I spoke to her."" She could not sign the papers as her hand was inflamed due to administration of IV fluids, he added.Beale faced a number of questions including some hostile ones as he and the other doctors sought to clear the air at a government arranged press conference at a star hotel on the health of the AIADMK supremo and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister when she was rushed to the Apollo Hospitals here on September 22 last.One of the questioners even told Dr Beale that the answers were ""unconvincing"", to which he responded with wonder and surprise. To another question, he said he had seen in his career similar cases but this was the first time he was justifying the line of treatment. He said Jayalalithaa was conscious while being brought from her home and that the process of treatment was ""perfectly straightforward"".Jayalalithaa was declared dead at Apollo hospital at 11.30 PM on December 5, a day after she suffered a massive cardiac arrest. ""It was a witnessed cardiac arrest,"" doctors said.Beale, who is a world renowned intensive care specialist, said Jayalalithaa had sepsis when she was brought into Apollo Hospital in a conscious state and the source of infection was unknown.The late Chief Minister was on and off ventilator and often also interacted after being admitted for fever and dehydration, Beale said. Beale was flanked by P Balaji of Madras Medical College and K Babu of Apollo Hospitals, who had signed in election forms on which her thumb impression was taken.

The press conference, which was called to dispel rumours on the late chief minister's death, comes a day after V K Sasikala, shadow of Jayalalithaa for nearly three decades, was elected leader of the AIADMK legislature party by its MLAs and set to become chief minister succeeding O Panneerselvam who tendered his resignation from the post citing 'personal reasons'.""We want to dispel rumours on Jayalalithaa's condition, treatment,"" the doctors said.

58ff1b7a7be9e04136162836,"GDP to rise next fiscal, says Economic Survey",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594051/gdp-rise-next-fiscal-says.html,2017-01-31,"New Delhi, Jan 31, 2017 (PTI) 16:22 ISTIndia's economic growth is likely to dip to 6.5 per cent this fiscal after shock demonetisation shaved off a good 0.5 percentage points but it will rebound to 6.75-7.5 per cent in the next financial year, Economic Survey said today, calling for bold cut in tax rates.The pre-Budget pointer called for cut not just in individual income tax rates and a timetable for reducing the corporate taxes but also for widening the net to progressively encompass ""all high incomes"".Though the Survey did not indicate what it meant by all high incomes, the reference may be to agriculture income which is currently out of the tax net.Invoking Mahatma Gandhi's vision of 'wiping every tear from every eye', it made a pitch for implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI) to entitle the poor with at least some income and thus eliminate poverty.""Given the uncertainty (after demonetisation), we provide a range: a 0.25 percentage point to 1 percentage point reduction in nominal GDP growth relative to the baseline of 11.25 per cent; and a 0.25 percentage point to 0.5 percentage point reduction in real GDP growth relative to the baseline of estimate of about 7 per cent,"" it said.Indian economy had grown by 7.6 per cent in 2015-16 and was projected to grow by 7.1 per cent in the current fiscal by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) that did not fully account for the disruption demonetisation had caused.""Over the medium run, the implementation of the GST, follow-up to demonetisation, and enacting other structural reforms should take the economy towards its potential real GDP growth of 8 per cent to 10 per cent,"" said the Survey tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley ahead of Union Budget 2017-18 to be unveiled tomorrow.For the 2017-18 fiscal, beginning on April 1, it put the real GDP growth at 6.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent rage. ""Even under this forecast, India would remain the fastest growing major economy in the world.""The forecast however had downside risks in the extent to which the effects of demonetisation could linger into next financial year, especially if uncertainty remains on the policy response.""Currency shortages also affect supplies of certain agricultural products, especially milk (where procurement has been low), sugar (where cane availability and drought in the southern states will restrict production), and potatoes and onions (where sowings have been low),"" the Survey said, asking the government to be vigilant on prevent other agricultural products becoming what pulses was in 2015-16.It also listed surge in global oil prices and possible eruption of trade tensions amongst the major countries as other risks.Prepared by a team led by Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian, the Survey said economic growth is expected to return to normal as new currency notes in required quantities come back into circulation.The pre-Budget document said demonetisation is also very unusual in its monetary consequences.""It has reduced sharply, the supply of one type of money  cash  while increasing almost to the same extent another type of money  demand deposits. This is because the demonetised cash was required to be deposited in the banking system,"" it said.To ensure that demonetisation indeed proves a catalyst for long-run changes in behaviour will require measures to complement with other non-punitive, incentive-compatible measures that reduce the incentives for tax evasion.""Demonetisation was a potentially powerful stick which now needs carrots as complements,"" it said prescribing a five-pronged strategy.It includes implementing Goods and Service Tax (GST) with broad coverage to include activities that are sources of black money creation  land and other immovable property.Also, individual income tax rates and real estate stamp duties should be reduced while a timetable for reducing the corporate tax rate could be accelerated, the Survey said.""The income tax net could be widened gradually and, consistent with constitutional arrangements, could progressively encompass all high incomes. (After all, black money does not make fine sectoral distinctions),"" it said.Besides, tax administration could be improved to reduce discretion and improve accountability, it added.Oil price rise to USD 60-65 per barrel could lead to reduction in consumption in India, less room for public investment and lower corporate margins, thereby further denting private investment, said the Survey.""The scope for monetary easing might also narrow, if higher oil prices stoked inflationary pressure,"" it added.It termed the passage of Constitutional amendment, paving the way for implementing the transformational GST, and demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as major domestic policy developments of the year.""The GST will create a common Indian market, improve tax compliance and governance, and boost investment and growth; it is also a bold new experiment in the governance of India's cooperative federalism,"" it said.Demonetisation, it said, has had ""short-term costs but holds the potential for longterm benefits"".""Follow-up actions to minimise the costs and maximise the benefits include: fast, demand-driven, remonetisation; further tax reforms, including bringing land and real estate into the GST, reducing tax rates and stamp duties; and acting to allay anxieties about over-zealous tax administration,"" it said.These actions would allow growth to return to trend in 2017-18, following a temporary decline in 2016-17, it said.The Survey said: ""Looking further ahead, societal shifts in ideas and narratives will be needed to overcome three long-standing meta-challenges: inefficient redistribution, ambivalence about the private sector and property rights, and improving but still-challenged state capacity.""In the aftermath of demonetisation, and at a time of gathering gloom about globalisation, articulating and embracing those ideational shifts will be critical to ensuring that India's sweet spot is enduring not evanescent."""

It was a murder, said Pushpa, sister of Ashok, who was gunned down in a fake encounter in 1996.After my brother was shot dead in the encounter, my father pursued the case in Dehradun but he died from a heart stroke in 2008. Then my aged mother took up the case and has pursued it till date. We had to sell our house and cattle to get money but we did not give up. The policemen visited us and told us to reach a compromise but we did not, Pushpa said.Ashok, along with three other youths from Vijay Nagar locality in Modi Nagar, had gone to Pilkhuwa to find a job in a carpet making unit on November 8, 1996. It was the day of Dhanteras festival, before Diwali. However, they were gunned down in an encounter at Machli Bazar. Their bodies were not returned to the families either.All the victims had bullet injuries to their chest while Jalauddin, Ashok and Pravesh also had bullet injuries on their head, just above the ear.Surat bhi nahi mili dekhne ko (I could not even get a last glimpse of my son). He worked at a nearby factory on daily wages and had gone out in search of another job. We searched a lot but could not find him. Since he left us, I have not been keeping well and have also lost sight in one eye. The other eye is also affected and I can hardly see. I had to sell my cattle to pursue the case, 70-year-old Sharifan, Jalaluddins mother, said.Mahender Singhs son Pravesh had also gone to Pilkhuwa while his parents were away to attend the last rituals of a relative. It was Dhanteras. He had enrolled in class 9 and also worked a daily job with his brother at a nearby factory. We went in search of him, to at least find his body, but the police did not show us even the body. They cremated all four, terming them unclaimed. Later, the police approached us for a compromise but we refused, 75-year-old Mahender, Praveshs father, said.The families said that they also protested outside the Prime Ministers residence in Delhi and got an assurance of Rs 1 lakh each.These were just promises. However, the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) helped us a lot. We relied on their counsel to get justice. The case was in a Dehradun court but it was later transferred to Ghaziabad. All families pursued the case and did not miss any hearing, he said.Of the four victims, only Jasbir, 23, was married. After the encounter on November 8, 1996, the police filed a final report and gave a clean chit to the personnel involved. The CBI took up the case on April 7, 1997, and named five police personnel in their chargesheet on September 10, 2001. The charges were framed in June 2005.On the day of the incident, the policemen involved had told their senior officials that two criminals had escaped into the sugarcane fields, following which they were ordered to open fire.After few minutes, the police shouted that two more badmash (goons) have been killed. Thereafter, Lal Singh came to the police station and filed a false written complaint against the deceased, the chargesheet stated.Then station house officer Lal Singh, sub-inspector Joginder Singh and constables Surya Bhan, Subhash Chand and Ranbir Singh were charged under section 193 (giving false evidence) of IPC apart from sections of murder and destruction of evidence.The section (193 of IPC) was levied as they had collected affidavits from locals to support their evidence in the encounter case. However, the people told the court that they were made to sign blank papers by the police and said that they did not sign any affidavit, Rajan Dahiya, the public prosecutor for the CBI, said."

The four - inspector of Bhojpur police station, a sub inspector and two constables - were convicted for gunning down four daily wagers in an encounter in Bhojpur in November 1996.The four cops were held guilty of murder, destruction of evidence and giving false evidence on February 20.During the alleged encounter, four youngsters - Jalaluddin, Jasbir, Ashok and Pravesh - were gunned down by cops, terming them as criminals, on the afternoon of November 8, 1996 - the day of Dhanteras festival.All four victims hailed from Vijay Nagar in Modi Nagar town and were daily wagers. They were from poor families and had gone to Pilkhuwa in search of daily wage job. They were sitting at a tea stall outside the Bhojpur police station when they were picked up by the cops inside the police station where they were tortured before being killed.Forensic investigations nailed the lies of the cops.After the investigation and trial which lasted more than two decades, CBIs Special Judge (anti corruption) Rajesh Chaudhary had on Monday held then station house officer Lal Singh, sub inspector Joginder Singh and two constables Surya Bhan and Subhash Chand as guilty for murder. The fifth accused Ranbir Singh died during the course of the trial.Initially, the Hapur Police investigated this case, but it gave a clean chit to the encounter team.The convicted cops initially maintained that they were travelling in their jeep along with several accused of a different case, but the four men opened fire at the police party near Machli Bazar, popularly known as Macheri ki puliya in Bhojpur.The convicts maintained that two of the four were shot in retaliatory fire by police while other two went into hiding in nearby sugarcane field and killed in police firing when more police force and senior officers arrived for help from Bhojpur, Modi Nagar, Niwari and Murad Nagar police station areas.However, the CBI took over investigation on April 7, 1997 and revealed that two victims, Jasbir and Jalaluddin were killed by Lal Singh and his colleagues on road while two others, Ashok and Pravesh, were killed in sugarcane fields even before the senior officers and police reinforcements could arrive.During the fake encounter, the cops used revolvers, pistols, rifles, stengun, carbines and AK-47s to open fire. The post mortem examination by Dr SC Aggarwal revealed that Jasbir sustained two bullets while Jalaluddin sustained five shots. The other two, Ashok and Pravesh, died after sustaining two and five bullet injuries, respectively.Interestingly, the CBI investigation also found that a bullet recovered from the body of victim Jasbir was allegedly fired from the official revolver of then IPS officer Jyoti Belur.It is not yet clear whether she had the possession of the weapon or not.Belur, who was posted as the Circle officer in the rank of assistant superintendent of police, was never charge sheeted by the CBI, but was summoned as an accused by the court on September 9, 2007.Belur is said be to living in United Kingdom and has failed to make a personal appearance in the case so far. Her petitions against the courts summon orders were rejected by the Allahabad high court and the Supreme Court.On the other hand, the case trial has been an ordeal for the poor families of the victims, who battled all odds and did not give up despite pressure from police to withdraw the case and lack of finances.After my brother was shot dead in the encounter, my father pursued the case in Dehradun but he died from a heart stroke in 2008. Then my aged mother took up the case and has pursued it till date. We had to sell our house and cattle to get money but we did not give up. The policemen visited us and told us to reach a compromise but we did not, Pushpa said, sister of deceased Ashok."

58ff1e4d7be9e0429666db39,BJP Tries to Grease Punjab Voters with Desi Ghee,http://www.hindustantimes.com/assembly-elections/punjab-elections-bjp-tries-to-woo-voters-with-dollops-of-desi-ghee/story-dmo2efvHwihk1GFMf30LtN.html,2017-01-25,"The BJP is trying to win Punjabi voters hearts through the stomach  with dollops of ghee.The party sweetened its atta-dal sop with a promise of highly subsidised desi ghee and sugar for the states 14 million below poverty line (BPL) beneficiaries earlier this week.Now, they can look forward to getting two kilos of desi ghee at a mere Rs 25 a kg, and five kilos of sugar at a discounted rate of Rs 10 a kg. Wheat flour will continue to cost Re 1 a kilo.The BJPs ghee treat comes close on the heels of subsidised tea promised by state Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh.The BJP stuck to ghee packaged in saffron containers despite Sukhbir Singh Badal, president of BJPs poll partner Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), trying to push edible oil as a more cost-effective alternative to clarified butter.Unwilling to be trumped even by its own ally, the Akalis have now promised gaushalas in every district to keep the ghee flowing.The dole was probably inspired by Amritsar, a place known for its high consumption of ghee.The Punjabi love for Indian clarified butter is evident from the manner in which Verka desi ghee, the main export of the Punjab State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Limited, has become a worldwide success.The states passion for desi ghee laddoos forms the foundation for one of its most modern private universities. The owners of Lovely Professional University in Jalandhar had started off as traders specialising in this very variety of sweetmeat. The recall value of Lovely laddoos was so great that they decided to retain it in the universitys title.Experts are not amused by the BJPs offer.Economist Sucha Singh Gill, who is yet to receive his pension amount for the month from the Patiala-based Punjabi University, termed it competitive populism at its worst. This state is reeling under a Rs 1.25 lakh-crore debt. It has to borrow to pay the interest on its debt. Who, then, will pay for this desi ghee?Dr SS Johl, chancellor of the Central University of Punjab at Bathinda, called it one of the most absurd promises made in state politics. Why dont they promise mirch-masala and milk as well? he remarked.Devinder Sharma, founder of Kisan Ekta, a union of 65 farmers organisations, found the BJP poll promise funny.The saying, aapke munh mein ghee shakkar rings true now."

It is late afternoon and we have been walking along the alleys of south Delhis Kotla Mubarakpur village for more than half an hour without any sign of Mubarak Shah Sayyids tomb, the areas signature monument that commemorates the 13th century king of Delhi Sultanate.That old building seems to be only a rumour. The shopkeepers we asked for directions confess to have heard of Mubarak Shah ka Makbara but they themselves have never seen it  and they have been here all their lives.Actually, we are lucky in not finding the monument. The walk in Kotla Mubarakpur is turning out to be as engaging as a stroll in scenic Lodhi Garden.This is a self-contained world teeming with roadside barbers, rice merchants, sugarcane juice vendors, and sellers of Hanuman Chalisa booklets. The showrooms of South Extension I market are just five minutes away but they seem to belong to another country. Finally, after crossing a public park, we start climbing a cramped lane, very dark and cool, and suddenly there it is  Mubarak Shahs elusive mausoleum.It looks like any obscure Lodhi-era tomb you might spot in the city. But it has far greater local atmosphere. On entering, we see four people sitting on chairs in the tombs verandah. They are playing cards. An elderly man is smoking a hookah. It could be a scene straight out of any village square in north India except that the backdrop is framed by centuries-old arches and columns of a kings memorial.The octagonal tomb is flanked by residential apartments. Some balconies are just an arm away from the dome. Walking around the monuments corridor is a brilliant way to observe the neighbourhood life that circles it  women are talking to each other in nighties, young men are glued to their smartphones, and a cat is staring down at two dogs.The areas other landmark is Shaad Hair Cutting Saloon.The central chamber is dark. There are half a dozen tombstones inside. Two dogs are sleeping on the biggest of the graves  probably of the Sultan himself. It is a most surreal view. Just then a woman in a blue salwar kurta walks in barefoot. The dogs wake up and go out quietly. The woman lights an earthen lamp, and bows at each grave with folded hands.Introducing herself as Meghnawati, she says, This makbara is of a peer who was a musalmaan Im a Hindu but I believe in peer babas.She offers us a batasha as prasada and leaves. The chamber becomes empty. The lamps flame flickers, casting shadows on the old stone walls. We quickly step out into the more assuring world of the living."

So have been his references to local icons to connect with the masses during campaigns for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Beginning his election campaign from western UPs Meerut on February 4 ahead of the first phase of polling, Modi has addressed 10 election meetings so far.He set the tone of his poll campaign in Meerut by likening his partys war against poverty, mafia raj and goonda raj to legendary freedom fighter Mangal Pandeys revolt against the British in 1857.Though born in Ballia, Pandey is considered a local hero in Meerut which was the epicentre of Indias first war of independent 160 years ago.The next day in Aligarh, Modi underlined the plight of cottage industries by referring to the once-popular local locks. It is a pity that the very locks that made Aligarh famous are being used to shut the lock factories, he said.He also criticised rival political parties for misusing BR Ambedkars name while his government prevented the house where Ambedkar lived abroad from being sold. Aligarh district witnessed violence when an Ambedkar statue was damaged a few years ago.In Bijnor, Modi paid tributes to Dalit saint Ravidas on his birth anniversary and said BJP goes by his ideals. He warmed up to the dominant Jats in the area by recalling former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh and how the Congress defamed him.A farmers welfare scheme named after Charan Singh will be launched if BJP forms the government in UP, he said.At his next rally stop Badaun, Modi proposed a police battalion each named after three women freedom fighters  Jhaklari Bai, Uda Devi and Awanti Bai  for ensuring safety to women. Jhalkari Bai and Uda Devi are the Bahujan Samaj Partys symbols of Dalit pride.Badaun hit headlines three years ago when two Dalit sisters, allegedly gangraped, were found hanging from the branch of a tree.Modi sympathised with the sugarcane growers misery in Lakhimpur Kheri while his speech in Kannauj was peppered with references to potatoes and perfumes.On February 16, the PM recalled Hardois association with the mythical Prahlad, revered for his devotion to Lord Vishnu. He also referred to Vishnus avatar Krishna, who made Gujarat his karmabhoomi after being born in UP. Born in Gujarat, I am working in UP, he said.The same day in Barabanki, Modi paid obeisance to Baba Lodheshwar Mahadev (Shiva), a major pilgrimage in the area.There is nothing political in Modijis recalling local icons during his speeches. Its a way of giving our legendary leaders respect and acknowledging their contribution to our society, state BJP spokesperson Harish Srivastava told HT.SK Dwivedi, Lucknow Universitys former professor of political science, said: The Prime Minister tries connecting with the masses by citing the names of local icons and great leaders but what has pained us sometimes is his language. The words he chooses for his speech should reflect the dignity of the post he is holding."

There is STEM-skill gap which has been acknowledged by all credible US sources. As per US department of labour, there will be 2.4 million unskilled STEM jobs by 2018 - more than 50% in the computer and IT related area, Singh said.India is the biggest beneficiaries of H-1B visas in the world with about 58% (majority from US) of the total global outsourcing business coming to it.The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa in the US, which allows American employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations.But India will not be affected alone if there is any H-1B visa restriction, industry leaders said, even the US will face the manpower-related problem.Senior IT industry leaders in India dared US President Donald J Trump to follow Mahatma Gandhis Swadeshi Movement launched in early 1900s during pre-independence era in India, and ask Americans to burn free-credit cards and get ready to pay $150 for the same.Indians had then burnt the imported clothes and boycotted imported sugar as part of the Swadeshi movement.Trump should follow Gandhi who had called upon its people to boycott the garments made in English factories and gutted them. Trump too should tell people to boycott free credit cards and pay $150 and destroy free cards. He should ask the Americans to set their free cards ablaze, said Nasscom vice chairman Raman Roy, who is also the CMD of the Quatrro Global Services.Roy who is one of the pioneers of the BPO industry in India, advocated for the butter and guns, theory of Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson (1948).He said that the countries, who are good at manufacturing guns should make guns and others produce butter, if they are good at it. Its a basic economics.Roy said the US lacks the required skill-set such as engineers. He said general productivity can be improved by specialisation as the very basics of the economy.The countries like India, the Philippines, Sri Lanka have the requisite knowledge and people not the America. About 85% of the engineering students who enroll in their universities are migrants, he said.As regards to the Indian contribution to the American economy, the Indian companies in the US paid $20billion as taxes in four years at the rate of $5billion annual tax, supporting 41,100 jobs and also did a lot of development work such as STEM skill development, the Nasscom said.Veteran BPO expert and founding team member of the BPIAI (Business Processing Industry Association of India), Deepak Kapoor said, I agree that the US cannot afford to go ahead with the anti-outsourcing bill but that is not the real question. The real question is what if President Donald Trump goes ahead on this to fulfill a political objective, like he has done with many other issues though intellectuals had thought otherwise.Kapoor said, The mood in the Indian BPO Industry is more of a caution. Since no one can suitably guess what the US President will do, there prevails an uncanny uncertainty. Yet, I see so many people giving out premature judgment that nothing will happen. We are trying to answer a political question economically.Nasscom said that Indian companies not only act as protector and creator of jobs in the US, they help the American economy grow stronger.Indian companies are hiring locally in the US and bridging the supply gap by bringing the people on short term visa, including H-1B. These visas play critical role not only for Indians but Americans and other global companies, Shivendra Singh said."

We will ensure power supply to the consumers and there will be no power cuts in the summer, he told reporters.At present, the state is generating 10,000 MW of power per day, while the demand is around 9,200 MW. The demand has come down of late due to decrease in power consumption by the industry and the agriculture sectors, he added.The minister, however, did not disclose the projected demand during the summer. He was speaking to reporters after the KPCL and the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd (RECL), a Government of India undertaking.Shivakumar said the MoUs had been signed to take long-term loans to the tune ofRs 37,000 crore from the RECL to take up projects related to power generation, transmission, rural electrification and modernisation. The RECL has agreed to provide loans at 8% to 10 % interest rate.The state government is not in a position to fund these projects from its own resources. Hence, the KPCL and Bescom, which will be implementing these projects, have taken steps to avail themselves of loans. The MoUs were signed in the presence of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah at his home-office Krishna.The KPCL will be implementing nine power-generation and modernisation projects to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. These include gas-based power generation plant near Yelahanka in Bengaluru urban district, thermal power plant at Yeramarus in Raichur district and the Sharavathi pumping station in Shivamogga district.Besides, all five electricity supply companies will soon take up a programme to instal meters to record power consumption in an estimated 9.5 lakh households in the state.

However, a reality check by the CAG came up with a completely different picture, exposing the flaws in India's environmental regulatory system.For instance, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) was given approval for a project to widen the Kundapura-Surathkal highway with a stipulation that 14,956 trees would be cut. But 18,400 trees were felled as NHAI implemented the project without any approval for cutting down more than 3,400 additional trees.The environment management plan of the first phase of the Mangalore Special Economic Zone project had a capital component of Rs 600 crore and an annual Rs 100 crore revenue expenditure. The money was to be spent on pollution control monitoring system, green belt and social welfare. However, the project proponent incurred a capital expenditure of Rs 186.71 crore and no revenue expenditure on the EMP, leading to a shortfall of 72% on the money needed for improving the environment, the CAG said in its report tabled in the Parliament on Friday.The private sector is no better. The environment clearance given to mining projects lists out the conditions on how the over burden dumps are to be managed in an ecologically sustainable manner. But two projects to enhance the iron ore production of M/s V S Lad and Son Iron Ore mine in Ballari and M/s Ashwathnarayana Singh were found gross violators.In the first project, the mining dumps were not protected against erosion and thick plantation of native trees were not carried out. The violations actually led to the cancellation of the mining lease. In the second project, the dumps were not properly stabilised.These are among the 352 projects that the CAG examined to check if the project developers follows that environmental clearance conditions while executing their projects.Other violators from Karnataka are a 1.12 kilo litre per day capacity molasses-based distillery unit of Nirani Sugars Ltd at Bagalkot and Sri Rameshwara Lift Irrigation Scheme of Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Limited in Belagavi.The distillery unit was found deficient for not installing effluent treatment plants, non-construction of the rain water harvesting system and shortfall in emergency preparedness plan. The lift irrigation scheme on the other hand did not implement the catchment area treatment plan to check soil erosion."

His supporters ensured the day is aptly celebrated with the hope that the party will retain power in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. However, February 23 proved to be a day of disaster for the NCP, with the party facing defeat in both the cities, which played major role in Sharad Pawars 50-year political career.Only solace for Pawar supporters is that Rohit Pawar, grandson of Appasaheb Pawar, elder brother of Sharad Pawar, won the zilla parishad election from Baramati tehsil. It is for the first time that somebody from the Pawar family contested a zilla parishad election.Pawars mother Shardabai was member of a local board in the pre-independence era.Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule began their political career by contesting the Assembly or Lok Sabha electiond.Rohit Pawar, who is handling a private sugar mill, preferred to begin his political career by contesting grass root election. The NCP has managed to retain the Pune zilla parishad by begging 44 seats. However, the BJP has won seven seats for the first time, while the Congress and NCP have bagged nine seats each. The zilla parishad election indicates the BJP and Sena have made considerable inroads in Pawars bastion.Setback to Pawar family is continuation of the 2014 Lok Saha elections, when the first serious signal of decline in Pawars hold over Pune city and district was experienced. Two months ago, anti-Pawar forces in Pune district had managed to win municipal council elections in Pune district, reducing NCP to Pawars home town of Baramati. Several NCP workers deserted party in the past two months, indicating Pawar has lost his grip over workers.The NCP was controlling Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations almost for two decades. They are now captured by the BJP. Both cities will have BJP mayors without any help from other parties. The NCP will now be the opposition party in Pune, with the party strength coming down to 38 from 52. Several prominent NCP leaders in Pune had lost elections, forcing Pune unit president Vandana Chavan to resign from the post, hours after the results were announced.Pimpri-Chinchwad has come as a big shocker for the NCP as former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was single-handedly controlling civic affairs. It was part of Sharad Pawars Baramati Lok Sabha constituency before delimitation in 2009. The NCP will be the opposition party in PCMC, with party bagging only 36 seats. In the dissolved house, the NCP had a majority of 82 members. The NCP failed to win voters here despite several development works in industrial township.NCP leaders admit it paid a heavy price for large scale defection in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The BJP managed to get three top NCP leaders in Pimpri-Chinchwad to win. Similar experiment was carried out in Pune in a few areas.Growing feeling among NCP cadre is that the Pawar family has lost its influence over party workers. The outcome has made NCP workers anxious as Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar looked into tje Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad elections and addressed a number or public rallies.The NCPs decline began in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when Sharad Pawars daughter Supriya Sule got elected with a small margin of 70,000 votes, against the huge difference of four lakh in 2009. Many believe Sule would have lost had Rashtriya Samaj Party president Mahadeo Jankar fought the election on BJP ticket.Ajit Pawars victory margin in Baramati Assembly constituency was reduced by 2,000 votes, while the party lost several sets in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Pune district.NCP leaders admit it would be tough time for the party because of series of serious setbacks in electoral politics after 2014.Read more: NCP possibly the biggest loser in the local bodies electionsParty over for Sharad Pawar?

But various state governments levy a value added tax of up to 12.5%.Low priced biscuits account for 52 % of the total 36 lakh tonnes of biscuits production annually. In terms of value Rs 13,850 crore worth low price biscuits are sold every year as against the Rs 22,150 crore turnover of the premium variety.We operate at very low margins ranging between 2% and 3%. These are easily washed out by a surge in sugar, wheat and vegetable oil prices, Haresh Doshi, President of the BMWA said.The BMWA said as many as 240 big factories that manufacture only low priced biscuits will be forced to down shutters if the government decides to tax them at higher rates. Glucose biscuits were retailing at Rs 40 per kg in 1996 and after 20 years cost Rs 70 per kg.There has been an increase of 225% in input costs, but we have passed on only 75% to the consumer, Doshi said.Contending that their biscuits are hygenically produced, he said any hike in the prices on account of high taxes would lead to a shift in demand to poor substitutes that are manufactured without adherance to quality and nutrition norms.Doshi argued that the biscuit industry contributes Rs 3000 crore to the exchequer annually and in no way want to shirk from the responsibility.But, premium biscuits such as oatmeal, cream, cheese and dry fruit cannot be taxed at par with low-priced biscuits, Doshi said."

He reached Noida at 10am and made his way to Sector 3, where he symbolically cleaned a road with a broom. He then visited Sector 6 where he took the cleanliness pledge along with Noida authority officials.In his address to party workers, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself took a broom in his hand and cleaned the roads in Delhi to inspire others to do the same.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has woken up the people and the party workers and inspired them to work for public welfare. Taking inspiration from him, we have decided to clean Uttar Pradesh. We will not only rid UP of garbage, but also of the ill feelings that officials have in their minds. We will clean everything from roads and garbage to the minds of the people, he said.State minister (independent charge) of cane development and sugar mills, industrial development, Suresh Rana and Noida MLA Pankaj Singh, who were present with Mahana, also said that they will work to make Noida a better city.We will bring in investment and help set up industries so that Noida surpasses Gurgaon in all aspects, including job creation and policing. It would be the place to work and set up a business.

To discourage people from eating junk food, we have recommended imposition of an additional tax on such food items, said a member of the group.A final call will be taken by the Prime Minister.The recommendations are likely to become government policy because a similar groups suggestions such as making Aadhar a money bill and advancing the Budget cycle were adopted last year.Read | Are you a millennial who binges on junk food?

Politically erudite Dalvir Singh Goldy, 33, had planned a career in politics when he was a university student. Things are going as per the plan, he says, alighting from his Mitsubishi SUV in Dhuri market where he is supposed to attend a nukkad meeting.Belonging to Punnawala village, soft spoken and suave Goldy became the Panjab University students council president in 2006. His political journey started when he was elected as a class representative in SD College, Chandigarh. He completed his post-graduation in History in 2007. The same year, he came back to his native village and started nurturing the constituency he is now a candidate from.Facts Name: Dalvir Singh GoldyAge: 33Party: CongressEducation: MA (History)Role model: Shaheed Bhagat SinghPoll quotient: Plays the native card and doesnt hesitate in telling the voters that he belongs to a middle-class family.By the way: Wears turban at religious functions, but otherwise prefers to be without the headgearIn 2010, he became national coordinator of National Students Union of India (NSUI) and currently is the general secretary of Punjab Youth Congress. He formed an NGO, Aashirwaad Foundation, for taking up the issues of the locals. I got confiscated two truckloads of bicycles during the parliamentary polls in 2014, which were to be distributed to the voters when poll code was already in force, says Goldy , sitting at a Congress councillors house.Main Punjab da putt haa, par meri jummevaari Dhuri prati vadd hai, kyonki main es dharti te janmiyaa haan.

I have no worry even though Hari Singh has all the money to buy votes. Sekhon makes big claims, but I have my own strengths, says Goldy, saying he is an ordinary man  son of a retired employee of Food Corporation of India (FCI). But the art of raising peoples issues is in his blood. My father remained a unionist during his service days and fought for employee rights, he explains.Goldy was lucky to have taken a head start in the campaigning as his name was announced in the first list announced on December 16. By now, he has covered most parts of the constituency  74 villages with 45,000 voters and Dhuri town with 1.1-lakh voters. He launched his campaign by paying obeisance at a gurdwara and a Shiv mandir. Besides the family members and relatives who are already campaigning for him, Goldy says his university days friends will boost the campaigning in the last 15 days.My wife Simrat plans and executes meetings on her won. Striking a rapport with the women in the constituency is mainly her responsibility, he adds. His father-in-law late Manpreet Singh Moranwali, a man with Left leanings, had unsuccessfully contested the assembly polls from Dhuri in 1997. His presence would have helped me a lot, he says.The segments 55% population is in the age group of 18 to 40 years.

However, a reality check by the CAG came up with a completely different picture, exposing the flaws in India's environmental regulatory system.For instance, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was given approval for a project to widen the Kundapura-Surathkal highway with a stipulation that 14,956 trees would be cut. But 18,400 trees were felled as NHAI implemented the project without any approval for cutting down more than 3,400 additional trees.The environment management plan of the first phase of the Mangalore Special Economic Zone project had a capital component of Rs 600 crore and an annual Rs 100 crore revenue expenditure. The money was to be spent on pollution control monitoring system, green belt and social welfare.However, the project proponent incurred a capital expenditure of Rs 186.71 crore and no revenue expenditure on the EMP, leading to a shortfall of 72% on the money needed for improving the environment, the CAG said in its report tabled in the Parliament on Friday.The private sector is no better. The environment clearance given to mining projects lists out the conditions on how the over burden dumps are to be managed in an ecologically sustainable manner. But two projects to enhance the iron ore production of M/s V S Lad and Son Iron Ore mine in Ballari and M/s Ashwathnarayana Singh were found gross violators.In the first project, the mining dumps were not protected against erosion and thick plantation of native trees were not carried out. The violations actually led to the cancellation of the mining lease. In the second project, the dumps were not properly stabilised.These are among the 352 projects that the CAG examined to check if the project developers follows that environmental clearance conditions while executing their projects.Other violators from Karnataka are a 1.12 kilo litre per day capacity molasses-based distillery unit of Nirani Sugars Ltd at Bagalkot and Sri Rameshwara Lift Irrigation Scheme of Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Limited in Belagavi.The distillery unit was found deficient for not installing effluent treatment plants, non-construction of the rain water harvesting system and shortfall in emergency preparedness plan. The lift irrigation scheme on the other hand did not implement the catchment area treatment plan to check soil erosion."

Every time we ask for it, every year we wrote it, one year we got it and the next year the government withdrew it. The diesel industry is so powerful there is no point in my saying it.Boosting public transport: We need an exemption on buses and more funding for public transport.

Not surprisingly, marriage is pushing them into debt.Now, a group of intrepid tribal activists associated with three organizations - Khedut Mazdoor Chetana Sangath (KMCS), Adivasi Ekta Parishad and Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti have launched a movement to cap the amount of bride price and also regulate the entire marriage so that it is affordable.For the past four months, the group has been holding meetings in tribal districts of Jhabua, Dhar, Alirajpur and Barwani with sarpanchs, Patels who are large land owners and other influential people of the villages to push through a consensus on the issue. On April 5, the group has called for a major meeting in Bhavra town of Alirajpur district, 400 km from Bhopal, to give a fillip to the movement.Earlier, the amount was small, and no one used to mind, but over the years due to the influence of non-tribal and tendency to show-off, the amount has now increased. The reverse dowry has increased to Rs 3.5 lakhs, liquor served in marriages costs around Rs 1 lakh. This is apart from the other marriage expenses which cost anywhere between Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Most tribal families do not have this kind of money and are forced to sell their land, migrate to other places to earn or borrow from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates and thus fall into a debt trap. We are planning to change all this, says tribal right activist Shankar Tadavla, who is a part of the movement.Says social activist Tapan Bhattacharya, who has been working in the tribal belt, Marriage is becoming a millstone on the neck of grooms, and it has become a sort of competition between tribal over who has the most expensive bride. This should end as it is ruining the tribal.Some of the proposed changes include capping the dowry to Rs 51,000 and one kg silver. According to the proposals, all branded liquor would be banned and only tadi, mahua, and country liquor made out of jaggery or sugar would be served. Disc Jockeys which have become a part of any tribal marriage nowadays is also proposed to be banned and in its place traditional tribal musicians with instruments like dhol and madal would be encouraged, with the overall thrust being on less of ostentatious display of wealth.Rules and regulations are also being framed to discourage the practice of bigamy or eloping with someone elses wife and punishment for these acts ranges from paying the girls father to paying fine of Rs 7 lakhs to the Gram Samiti.And although it may not stand legal scrutiny, one of the proposals says marriages between tribal and non-tribal would not be recognized. There is also a proposal to impose a fine of Rs 5 lakhs and take legal action against any non-tribal molesting any tribal girl.In a thrust to tribal education, there are also plans to impose a fine of Rs 1000 on any family that does not send their children to schools.Rahul Banerjee one of the founders of Khedut Mazdoor Chetana Sangath (KMCS), that has fought for the rights of tribal in the area welcomed the initiative. The crucial thing is to rope in the sarpanchs of the villages as they have the maximum influence and without their help the movement will lose its momentum as has happened in the past."
58ff29a57be9e04136163142,"Bariatric surgery, better option than diets",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596907/bariatric-surgery-better-option-diets.html,2017-02-17,"Bariatric surgery, better option than dietsJane E Brody, Feb 18, 2017, International New York Times 23:04 ISTCompared to those who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionallyBariatric surgery is probably the most effective intervention we have in healthcare, said Laurie K Twells, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland.She bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight-loss surgerys ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life.I havent come across a patient yet who wouldnt recommend it, Twells said in an interview. Most say they wish theyd done it 10 years sooner. She explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying  and failing  to lose weight and keep it off. And the reason is not a lack of willpower.These patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again, Twells said. The weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months, often because a body with long-standing obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate, an effect not seen after bariatric surgery, which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract.In reviewing studies that followed patients for five to 25 years after weight-loss surgery, Twells and colleagues found major long-lasting benefits to the patients health and quality of life. Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being.Equally important are the undeniable medical benefits of surgically induced weight loss. They include normalising blood sugar, blood pressure and blood lipid levels and curing sleep apnea. Although bariatric surgery cannot cure Type 2 diabetes, it nearly always puts the disease into remission and slows or prevents the life-threatening damage it can cause to the heart and blood vessels.Even in the small percentage of patients who ultimately lose little weight after surgery, significant metabolic benefits persist, according to findings at the Cleveland Clinic.In a study of 31 obese diabetic patients who had not lost a lot of excess weight five to nine years after surgery, a modest weight loss of just 5 to 10% resulted in a reduction of cardiovascular risk factors and blood sugar abnormalities, Dr Stacy Brethauer and colleagues reported.For the two most popular surgical techniques  the gastric bypass and the gastric sleeve  the metabolic benefits are independent of weight loss, Brethauer said in an interview. Both methods permanently reduce the size of the stomach. But the gastric band procedure, which is reversible, lacks these benefits unless patients maintain significant weight loss, he said.Furthermore, as a study last year of 2,500 surgical patients at the Veterans Affairs Medical Centre in Durham, North Carolina, found, those who underwent bariatric surgery had lower overall death rates up to 14 years later than comparable patients who did not have weight-loss surgery.Experts regard the reluctance of some insurers, including Medicaid programmes in many states, to cover the cost of bariatric surgery as penny-wise, pound-foolish. Failing to reverse extreme obesity can end up costing far more per patient than the typical $30,000 price of bariatric surgery  sometimes even millions more.Counter to popular impressions that most people treated surgically regain most or all the weight they lose initially, the latest long-term research has shown otherwise.In a decade-long follow-up of 1,787 veterans who underwent gastric bypass, a mere 3.4% returned to within 5% of their initial weight 10 years later. This finding is especially meaningful because the researchers at the VA centre in Durham were able to keep track of 82% of gastric bypass patients, a task too challenging for most clinics.The study, by Matthew L Maciejewski and colleagues published in August in JAMA Surgery, found that 10 years later, more than 70% of surgical patients lost more than 20% of their starting weight, and about 40% had lost more than 30%.Gastric bypass, an operation called Roux-en-Y, resulted in a somewhat greater weight loss at 10 years than the newer gastric sleeve surgery and significantly more than the adjustable gastric band (Lap-Band) surgery, which has fallen out of favour in the last two or three years, Maciejewski said.Safer procedureBariatric surgery, regardless of the method used, is also much safer nowadays than it was even a decade ago, said Dr Jon C Gould, a surgeon at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee who wrote a commentary on the VA study. However, he noted, the surgery is vastly underutilised, to the detriment of patients health and the nations health care costs.Less than 1% who would qualify for bariatric surgery are actually getting it, Gould said. Although the vast majority have health coverage, insurance companies and many Medicaid programmes put it out of reach for most people by demanding that they already have several obesity-related health conditions and are taking a slew of medications to control them.For example, he said, to be covered for bariatric surgery, Wisconsin Medicaid requires that a person with dangerously high blood pressure has to be taking three or more medications for it and still not have a normal pressure.He cited a further deterrent to bariatric surgery: a perception that its dangerous and doesnt work, beliefs countered by the research findings cited above. Most of the surgeries are now done laparoscopically through tiny incisions.Given the well-documented safety and effectiveness of bariatric surgery, it is increasingly being performed in people whose obesity is less severe  those with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or lower  but who have a metabolic disorder like Type 2 diabetes related to their weight.Gould suggested that people interested in bariatric surgery seek out programmes that have been jointly accredited by the American College of Surgeons and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, which have combined forces to promote quality control.While experts agree that money would be better spent on prevention than treatment, Twells pointed out that we have yet to find a way to prevent obesity, and people whose health is compromised by their weight deserve to be treated by the most effective method we have."

58ff2b547be9e0413616327e,Sugar cane politics leaves bitter taste among farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/595311/sugar-cane-politics-leaves-bitter.html,2017-02-07,"Sugar cane politics leaves bitter taste among farmersDalip Singh, Feb 8, 2017, MEERUT/BAGHPAT/SAHARANPUR, DHNS 0:34 ISTWestern Uttar Pradeshs sugar cane belt, that stretches from Delhis satellite town of Ghaziabad and goes up to Pilibhit, is harvesting the sweet produce at a time when politicians are busy exploiting the crop issue in the Assembly polls.Like the cash-rich crop harvested once a year, sugar cane-associated problems are also dealt with seasonally by political parties  every five years around the time of elections  or when farmers take to agitation.In their individual bid to reach out to the agrarian community ahead of first two phases of polling in this region, which will be held on February 11 and 15, the BJP, Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, BSP and RLD were quick to promise timely clearance of pending payments of sugar cane farmers.But, the assurances fail to enthuse lakhs of farmers, who cultivate the crop in 33 districts of the highest sugar cane producing state of the country.We are not getting anything from the government, lamented Pradeep Sharma, wearing mud-stained clothes and armed with sickles along with his wife Kamlesh and others in the familys lush green standing sugar cane in a Kurali village field adjacent to Meerut-Baghpat road.Owner of 26 bigha of agricultural land, Sharma narrated to DH that he is living on borrowed means. We have no money after selling the crop for the last two years, making it difficult to run the family.Adding to his litany of woes are shortage of labour and lurking uncertainty due to communal tension in surrounding areas of his village.The farmers get Rs 300 per quintal of crop sold in the market. Only distance separates Sharma from other farmers like Rupender Tomar in Badhot and Tanveer Alam in Saharanpur but their worries are similar and constant in the last three years.Their gloomy story gets supplemented by the National Sample Survey Offices (NSSOs) 70th round survey conducted during July 2012 June 2013. It showed that the total income of an agricultural household per month was Rs 6,426. But, the total expenditure was Rs 9,502.That meant that each month a household, including that of farmers, is accumulating debts of little over Rs 3,000.Farmers have a feeling that the governments at the centre and in state have been offering packages to bail out factories but not to tillers of the crop. For the year 2016-17, sugar mills owe more than Rs 5,000 crore to farmers. Previous years dues of nearly Rs 360 crore also remain as Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself had stated in Meerut on February 4 that his government had fulfilled partys 2014 Lok Sabha election promise to farmers by releasing Rs 22,000 crore which was 99% of the amount pending for 2014-15.RLD state general secretary Rajendra Singh Chikara is of the view that farmers are distressed due to prevailing situations. They are losing interest in farming since they are not getting instant money for their produce which is a perishable item.There are 116 sugar mills operating in the state which account for over 40% of the total production of the crop in the country."

The stock limit for traders in West Bengal is 1,000 tonnes.The countrys sugar output is estimated to fall for the second consecutive year to around 20 million tonnes in 2016-17 season (October-September), much lower than the annual demand of 24-25 mt.To boost domestic supply, the government has allowed duty free import of 5,00,000 tonnes of raw sugar till June."

His family has a priority card which entitles them 5kg ration (4kg wheat at Rs2 per Kg and 1kg rice at Rs 3 per Kg) per person listed on the card.Sunita and Kumar are not the only ones in the Sheikh Sarai slum, to be deprived of their rights, though with more than a billion enrolments, the government is tomtoming the success of the Aadhaar project.Only a few days ago, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the minister in charge of the UIDAI claimed linking of the Aadhaar with ration distribution has brought about more transparency and saved public money to the tune of Rs 14,000 crore.The government is now making the linking of permanent account numbers (PAN) to Aadhaar mandatory ignoring the controversy over the project since the inception of UIDAI in 2009.The Aadhaar has been challenged in the Supreme Court on several grounds, including national security, violating right to privacy, excluding some people from benefits of welfare programmes.Since 2013, the top court has issued seven interim orders, directing voluntary use of Aadhaar and that no one should be denied benefits to which they are otherwise entitled, if they do not have the 12 digit number.Notwithstanding such riders, the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 came into force on September 12 last year.The Act makes Aadhaar mandatory to get subsidies, benefits and services provided by the State.The government has expanded its scope to even filing of Income Tax returns.However, activists affirm that making Aadhaar mandatory is unconstitutional and a complete disregard of the Supreme Courts orders.Reetika Khera, associate professor of Economics in IIT Delhi, accused the government of creating false impression that the SC orders have become redundant following the enactment of the Aadhaar Act.The most common trick used by the government to get around the courts order is to state that those who do not have Aadhaar can continue to get their entitlements if they enrol for it and that the government will facilitate this.This is sugar-coating on a bitter pill, says Khera. You just stop getting your entitlements  until you enrol for it. This is the reality of it, though the government vehemently denies it.The civil society has been alleging government is maintaining a double-standard on the issue.Though enrolment for Aadhaar is voluntary, you have to compulsorily enroll for it if you want any entitlements from the state, pointed out Anjali Bhardwaj of Satark Nagrik Sangathan.Some even say the identification number is a tool for the government to keep a tab on the residents.Nandan Nilekani, the first chief of UIDAI, however, dismissed all concerns about Aadhaar-linked state surveillance: Surveillance is the last thing on the governments agenda. The mobile phone is a bigger tool of surveillance than Aadhaar.Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive officer at UIDAI, said: The Act ensures that no one is denied of any benefits for the want of the Aadhaar. It is required only for ensuring that the benefits reach the right individuals.Since 2012, the UIDAI has done 500 crore authentications, 100 crore eKYC transactions, 32 crore Aadhaar enabled payment system transactions, and not a single case of identity theft or financial loss has been reported over a period of five years, he claimed.With ever increasing last-mile glitches, connectivity and network issues, machine malfunctioning, there is a growing criticism that in a bid to weed out the fakes, the government is depriving many deserving people of their entitlements.For the anomalies, the UIDAI officials pass the buck to concerned departments that implement the welfare schemes.The Aadhaar only helps various agencies and departments to identify a person, said a UIDAI official, adding if anyone is denied of his or her entitlement due to non-availability of the unique number, it is only because concerned officials are not properly following the law or the notification.There are more than 30,000 common service centres where people can update their existing details. They can also send details by post or email. There is a special provision to enrol a child below five years by linking his/her details at the enrolment centres or the Aadhaar ID of the parent, he pointed out.But those opposing the Aadhaar are not convinced. They argue technology is vulnerable to failures and is not a panacea for curbing corruption.Imagine if you had to board a flight or withdraw cash and your Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, mandatory for the transaction, fails, and you are requested to go re-enroll and wait for records to be updated, Khera said.Bhardwaj maintained that corruption could take place even in the welfare schemes that are based on Aadhaar authentication such as PDS.After the authentication, the ration shop owners can give less provisions than what is entitled, citing lack of availability or supply. In such a scenario, what can the beneficiaries do? There is no redressal mechanism in place. How will the thumb authentication ensure that the ration shop is not depriving the beneficiary? she asked.Amid these claims and counterclaims, the reality perhaps lies somewhere in between.The Aadhaar will solve only a part of the problem. It cannot be a one stop solution for all ails, said a senior UIDAI official.Read about the people entangled in the Aadhaar web of confusion:IDENTITY CRISIS: Sabra Khatoon Ansari, Jagdamba CampSabra Khatoon Ansari holds up her Aadhaar card which erroneously mentions her sex as male.

Due to the anomaly, she is facing severe identity problems to get benefits of various government welfare schemes such as Laadli and EWS medical card.Her father MD Salam attributes the error to chaos at the Aadhaar enrolment centre where his daughter got her biometric data registered in 2014. He says several attempts by him to rectify the mistake went in vain.MISSING LAADLI: Mahi, Motilal Nehru Camp, Near JNUSaroj and Prem Kumar Kanojia with their daughter Mahi, who could not be enrolled for the Laadli scheme.

(Arun Sharma/HT PHOTO)Rukampal is not getting his monthly old-age pension because his age mentioned on the Aadhaar Card is less than the pensionable age.As per the voter ID card, Rukampals age as on 1/1/2013 is 67 years, whereas his Aadhaar Card issued on 8/3/2012 mentions his year of birth as 1957, that makes him 55-year-old at the time of the enrolment.To correct the mistake, Rukampal says he even paid Rs 300 to a local agent, who works at the Aadhaar enrolment centre to make a new Aadhaar card. Nothing came out of it.After the Delhi government revised the old age and disability pensions, senior citizens in the age group of 60-69 years are now entitled to get Rs 2,000 monthly, while those above 70 years get Rs 2,500 per month.Iss burdape mein bhee koi sahayta nahee (there is no respite even in this old age), he said."

The SP-Congress combine had won 29 seats and the BSP had bagged 23 of the 73 seats in the region.Though the alliance hope to get the majority of Muslim votes, the BSP has sought to queer its pitch by fielding a large number of Muslim candidates. A division in Muslim votes will favour the BSP and the BJP, said a senior SP leader here.Firebrand Muslim leader Asaduddin Owaisis All India Muslim Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has also put up its candidates on a number of seats, triggering apprehension of a division in their ranks.Muslim votes are decisive in Muzaffarnagar, which had witnessed large-scale communal riots in 2013, Bulandshahar, Hapur, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Shamli districts.The BJPs hopes hinge on the Jat support. Though there was no visible wave in its favour like in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the saffron party hopes the community will back it this time too.A perceptible anger in the community owing largely to the Centres handling of the Jat agitation in neighbouring Haryana, non-payment of sugarcane arrears and lack of assurance on reservation, however, has sent the alarm bells ringing in the BJP.BJP national president Amit Shah reportedly held a meeting with prominent Jat leaders in Delhi in a bid to persuade them to support his party."

What will happen when they have joined hands. If you want to save UP, you will have to save it from these families,"" he said addressing a rally here. With BJP locked in a tough fight in the state assembly polls, the Prime Minister dwelt at length on the ""family rule"" of the Yadav clan and cases of major crimes under its watch, besides ""corruption"" during the reign of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati governments.Modi, who has been accused by Congress of using foul language and repeatedly humiliating opposition after his raincoat jibe against former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, persisted with his shrill attack on rivals saying they have only served their families. With Jats playing a key role in the two phases for which polling will be held tomorrow and February 15, he said a BJP government in the state will set up a farmers welfare fund named after Charan Singh, a noted Jat leader.Clearing the dues of sugarcane farmers and waiving loans of small and marginal farmers, both promises being part of the BJP's manifesto, will be a top priority for the state government if his party is voted to power, he said. It was, however, his attack on the SP-Congress alliance and the ruling Yadav family which was the focus of his speech. ""I do not know Akhilesh Yadav much. I have met him a few times in meetings and it seemed to me after reading various reports that he is an educated young man who is trying to learn. I was hopeful that a young man will be fit for politics in 5-10 years.""On the other hand there is a Congress leaders who does so many childish acts that if you do a search on computer, you will find that no other leader has as many jokes on him as he has. ""Even senior Congress leaders keep a distance from him. When the leader avoided by his senior party leaders was embraced by Akhilesh, then I began doubting his wisdom. One can make blunders but not of this kind,"" Modi said, targeting the Congress vice president.He said it is an alliance between two families, one of which ""looted"" the country and the other Uttar Pradesh. He noted that so many members of the extended ruling Yadav family are MPs, MLAs and serving in various other capacities in government. While Bijnor with about 2,000 villages has one MP, there are so many of them in Parliament, assembly and other government bodies from Safai, the family village of Akhilesh Yadav, he said. They made one caste (Yadav) as their vote bank but served only their family, he said.Accusing the Akhilesh Yadav government of suppressing rivals by lodging false criminal cases against them, Modi said poll results on March 11 will ""expose"" it and a BJP government will launch a probe into all such cases. Can any decent person without any political affiliation say that the UP government has been unable to protect good people, the Prime Minister said, adding that a wave of change was blowing across the state in his party's favour, forcing SP and Congress to come to each other's rescue after targeting each other for years.He cited several incidents, including the alleged Badaun gang rape, and subsequent insensitive comments of the ruling party leaders to allege that SP will not be able to protect women. Without naming them, Modi referred to SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav's remarks that ""boys make mistakes"" in reference to a rape case and also that of senior SP leader Azam Khan. Khan, he said, had to apologise in the Supreme Court.Targeting Congress and SP, he said both ruling families believe that running governments is their right and will not allow the common man to do it. Raising the corruption issue, he said those who ""looted"" the state under the rule of BSP chief Mayawati were given good positions by the current government and referred to graft cases involving Yadav Singh, who held senior positions in the Greater Noida Authority in the two governments and is currently behind bars.Without naming Singh, Modi said he was sent to jail after central agencies began probing him. Akhilesh Yadav government went to the Supreme Court to oppose handing over the prove to the CBI, he said."

These steps have hurt their savings and hit their daily budgets hard, the Congresss chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a statement.He said the only development people are getting to see is that of rising prices, an expensive digital India, arbitrary bank charges levied by banks.Surjewala said the Modi government has dealt a big blow to the pockets of crores of people who avail health insurance.Apart from allowing higher commissions to agents, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has also proposed up to 50% increase in insurance premium for cars, motor cycles as well as commercial vehicles.He said the government was withdrawing subsidy on sugar sold through public distribution system or ration shops, and has lowered the interest rates on small saving schemes such as PPF, Kisan Vikas Patra and Sukanya Samriddhi scheme by 0.1%.The interest rate on one of the most popular small savings schemes  PPF -- is cut by 10 basis points to 7.9%, the lowest level since 1980, thereby adversely affecting the savings of crores of Indians and their future, the Congress leader said.He also raised the issues of income tax changes and charges on delay in filing tax returns.Deception of voters and betrayal of people's faith is the hallmark of Modi ji's brand of politics. The BJP government is making all efforts to hurt and backstab the hardworking middle class and poor of India. The Congress demands immediate rollback of these anti-people policies of the BJP, Surjewala said."

The 55-year-old resident of Holland was here to fulfill her fathers last wish  which comprised tracing their familys roots in Mainpuri with nothing more than a vague address to go by.Shantas father was just a boy of nine when the British sent him and his mother to Surinam in South America over 105 years ago. Later, he shifted to Holland.I have been here twice since 1984. So, this is my third attempt to trace our roots in Mainpuri, and it certainly wont be my last. I will find them sooner or later, she says.During this visit, Shanta and a friend  Seema Kiran  visited the residence of Mainpuris late Raja Tej Singhs sarvarakar (custodian) to look for records, but in vain. Raja Tej Singh was the ruler of the region in the beginning of the 20th century.Shantas father, Shyam Sundar Ram Ratan, had passed away in 1976. My grandmother and my father had to leave Mainpuri on April 3, 1912. The British regime took them to Kolkata on the pretext of making a trip to the Shri Ram Temple, from where they were sent to Surinam by ship. They were made to work as bonded labourers at a sugarcane farm in Surinam, she says.Though Shanta knows Suraj Kali was 25 when she reached South America on May 14, 1912, she has no knowledge of what happened to her husband. That was yet another mystery to be unraveled.However, it may not be a very easy task  considering that Shanta is aware neither of the caste nor the address of her fathers long-lost family. She was seen moving around Mainpuri through Sunday and Monday, making enquiries about the past from local residents.Way back in 1984, Shanta had visited the British embassy in Surinam to look at the records of people brought in to work in plantations. They told him that the name of her grandmother, a Myanmarese citizen married to a Mainpuri resident, was Sonkali Ram Sahai. However, it wasnt clear if Ram Sahai was her husband or father. The clue that brought me here this time was an address  Chappatti Mohalla in Mainpuris Kotwali area, she says.Shanta, who has four children and a husband back in Holland, speaks Hindi. She will be flying back to Holland from Delhi on March 10."

No swivel doors, reflective floor tiles or any of the on-duty staff welcoming you with a smile --- some of the characteristics that one would normally associate with a VIP section at a government hospital.State health minister Kali Charan Saraf on Saturday reportedly said that the BJP workers can go to Room No .23 and avail VIP facilities. The comment evoked a sharp reaction from the opposition Congress following which the minister claimed that he was misquoted.Old ceiling fans dangle in the room that has been divided into seven cubicles. A steel almirah near the wash basin in the room bears the writing in white paint: Room No 23 / VIP.Outside the room, patients and attendants shuffle around with papers in their hands while some flock to the drug store opposite to it. Signboards inform about the WiFi service at the hospital and also about the area being under the CCTV surveillance.Kali Charan ji jaisa koi mantri nahin hai poore Rajasthan ki dharti pe. Koi bhi chala jaye uski madad karte hain (There is no minister like Kali Charan Saraf in Rajasthan. He helps everybody), says Pintu Sharma, who claims to be working for the minister. He is accompanying another BJP worker who is constantly scratching his body and has come to seek treatment at Room No. 23.Sharma blames the media for distorting Sarafs remarks. The minister meant that the rooms facilities are already being used by ordinary patients and the BJP workers too should not face any kind of problem in medical consultation, he adds.A woman patient in the room seeking medication for the swelling in her leg says she did not know that it was a VIP room.A hospital staff says that the room was meant for routine check-up. IAS, IPS, and RAS officers or MLAs are given preference if and when they come. Otherwise, the room serves the general patients, he says requesting not to be named.Navratan Sharma, a patient in his sixties recalling his long association with the Congress and his grandfathers role in the independence movement, alleges that the minister was trying to attract people to the BJP by extending such benefits. He has come to the Room No. 23 to get his blood sugar level checked.Another BJP worker, Vinod Mathur, was also present in the room. He had come after hearing the ministers remarks. Working at the BJP office since past 26 years, he had come to get his eyesight checked. Here, the turn comes a little earlier, he adds."

Among all the comments, one thought all of them agreed on is this: That its time we treated women as equals and gave them the respect due to them.Here are a few comments from our popular TV stars.Priyal GorI feel really blessed because my parents have brought me up as an independent girl. I have been working since I was a 15-year-old girl, which has helped me a lot. Parents play a crucial role in making their daughters independent. However, our society still doesnt respect women. Although our shows are women-centric, they do not necessarily educate men to respect women. Women of this generation are independent and proud of themselves but the men in our society still expect to be the head of the family. I dont know if Womens Day is actually helpful because the perception in regards to women has not changed much. A man will feel insecure if the woman is ahead of them whether it is in their careers or in monetary gains.Aishwarya SakhujaThe fact that we need to celebrate a day dedicated to women clearly shows that we are still not a society that champions equality. Why do we need Womens Day? Why cant we treat women as special all the time. The equality has to come every day. Every woman needs to understand that women empowerment comes from within themselves. We need to believe that we can do whatever we want and even exceed our own expectations. One needs to understand that its not about who is more powerful and no NGO can help you unless you want to help yourself. Even in the television industry we need to stop showing saas  bahu drama where the highpoint of the show is if a female lead forgets to add sugar in the tea. We need to stop showing women so weak and stranded.Shoma AnandI feel it is important to celebrate Womens Day because we need to feel proud and celebrate the day for our success. In India, women have carved an identity of their own, and contributing to the betterment of the society. Even in our industry there are so many shows that promote women empowerment. I wish every woman respects other women in her life and helps out a woman in need. Only then will we be truly empowered.Aditi SajwanI feel Womens Day is overrated. If we look at the current situation, we are still backward when it comes to womens empowerment, womens education or their rights. In our country, women are financially dependent on men. They need to stand on their own to get that respect for themselves. Secondly, our society is still to look at women and their clothes differently. We are still judged by the type of clothes we wear or how we behave, and then blame us for all the violence committed against us. In our industry, actresses are independent but it is not portrayed on screen. It is very important to make men understand that everyone is equal. Every woman needs to stand up for herself and keep her head high. I wish they strongly communicate and create uniqueness in their own space.Niti TaylorToday, many women match steps with their male counterparts. I support and raise my voice against violence against women in many ways. Our society must understand the needs of women as well.Helly ShahWomen can do anything and everything. They just need to be brave, fearless and believe that they are equally powerful and capable of doing whatever they want to do. They can bring the change the world requires. We should be strong enough to take our decisions and take a stand for ourselves.Tanya SharmaWomens Day should be celebrated all through the year. I wish we become more fearless and more independent. Cheers to all the lovely women, we are strong and we are just too awesome for this world.Roop DurgapalOur scriptures say, Where Women are honoured, divinity blossoms there, and where women are dishonoured, all action no matter how noble remain unfruitful. A woman completes the man and brings life on earth.For harmony and balance in a society, women need to be given equal status, respect and importance.Mahika SharmaA woman has the power to give life. If we dont exist, flowers would have no meaning, the moon would not be important any more, and pearls would be worthless. Beauty, fragrance, emotions are from us. Without us life will be like rocks or deserts.Parineeta BorthakurWe are three sisters. My mother always used to say that my father was immensely happy when we were born. We need more men like my dad in our society. Women need to teach their brothers, sons, husbands and the entire male community to respect women as they have come from one, and you will get your next generation from one.Gulfam KhanMarch 8 is generally celebrated as Womens Day, but in all fairness the world is all about the feminine energy. Mother Earth, Jag Janini... whatever you call her, women rule the birth cycle, and that is the reason every day is as much a womans day as it is a mans day.Shalini KapoorA day for appreciating womens contribution and celebrating it is very important. I am not a feminist. I never doubt or question a mans contribution. But I believe we need to celebrate womanhood every day of the year. And yes, I do raise my voice against violence, not gender.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

Gandhi had visited Champaran in 1917 to espouse the cause of indigo farmers.Around 200-300 workers of a local sugar factory, since shut, were demanding release of unpaid wages since 2002. The immolation bid, announced earlier, was part of the ongoing agitation for the last four days.

(Madnakar/HT photo)Eyewitnesses said the district administration initially did not take the immolation threat seriously. However, when the matter worsened, the district administration sent in a magistrate with police reinforcement. Seeing the cops, two workers staging a sit-in, jumped into the fire, which was ignited using firewood and rubber tyres.As the two persons burned, agitators resorted to brickbatting. Seeing the rampaging mob, the police initially resorted to baton charge and then lobbed teargas shells. When matters worsened, the cops opened fire, injuring nearly 15-20 persons in the melee, some reportedly receiving splinter injuries.East Champaran superintendent of police Jitendra Rana said that no one was injured when police fired in the air to dispel the mob. He, however, admitted that some policemen and civilians were hurt in the brickbatting and subsequent police caning. He said police had to fire three rounds in the air and lobbed 17 teargas shells to control the mob.Protestors help a person who was injured in police lathicharge in Motihari on Monday.

He said that many were injured in the police firing, but were not getting themselves treated in government health facilities for fear of being implicated in false cases by the police.Additional collector Arshad Ali said that the police had on Sunday met the protestors and assured them of an audience with the district magistrate on Monday. As soon as the cops reached the venue, the protestors began pelting stones and a couple of them tried to immolate themselves, he added.Governor Ramnath Kovind is scheduled to visit here on April 13 as part of Champaran satyagrah celebrations, followed by chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is expected to participate in the proposed satyagrah smriti yatra on April 18.

The loan disbursement has been 80% of the overall agriculture credit target which was set at Rs 51,000 crore for the fiscal.Anticipating non-repayment of loans, the state government has made it clear that those paying their dues will get bigger benefits through different schemes.The government plans to bring a scheme under which those farmers repaying their agriculture loan on time will get bigger benefits, state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar told HT.Bank of Maharashtra, the largest public sector lender in the state, has seen sharp rise in its NPA from 9.55% in 2015-16 to 13.26% in 2016-17. Part of the reason, bankers say, was also demonetisation when recovery almost came to a halt.What we have seen is a growing tendency among borrowers who are otherwise capable to repay loan but postpone their decision. The repeated loan waiver is hampering the culture of repayment of dues as honest people do not see any incentive in paying back the money they borrowed from the bank, Rajkiran Bhoir, general manager, Bank of Maharashtra, said.In western Maharashtra, where farmers produce sugarcane, the recovery of loans has gone down from the previous year, officials said.Solapur district, which has highest number of sugar factories, recorded farm loan recovery of up to 65% till March, compared to 77% during the previous year, according to district central cooperative bank officials, who did not wish to come on record since they were not authorised to speak to the media.In Ahmednagar district, farm loan recovery for the outgoing financial year was just 33%, slightly less compared to previous year, an official of Ahmednagar District Central Cooperative Bank, which through its network of agriculture credit societies along with other financial institution distributed agriculture loan, said.When there is a demand for farm loan waiver, people naturally prefer to wait, hoping they get relief. But there are many borrowers who repay their dues, said Charudatta Arkatkar, secretary, State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), a representative body of all lending institutions in the state.The fall in loan recovery has been recorded despite a good monsoon this year with the economic survey predicting a 12.5% growth rate for agriculture in 2016-17 from the minus 4.6% in 2015-16.Congress workers raising slogans with Tamil Nadu farmers during a protest against Centre in Coimbatore on Wednesday, demanding farm loans waiver. (PTI)The UP government on Tuesday decided to waive farm loan worth Rs 36,369 crore. The same day Madras High Court, while hearing a plea, asked the Tamil Nadu government to provide relief to all the farmers by waiving farm loan.Coming under pressure from opposition and ally Shiv Sena, chief minister Fadnavis said his government is in favour of loan waiver and was studying the UP model.Against growing demand for loan waiver, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel cautioned about the moral consequences of such a scheme saying, waivers undermine an honest credit culture.Kishore Tiwari, an agricultural activist and chairman of government constituted task-force on recommending solutions to agrarian crisis, said the relief should be offered only to farmers affected by drought and those who cant repay dues.There is no point extending the farm loan waiver to all the farmers the way government did in 2008. Only those who are financially in bad shape due to successive droughts and other reasons should be given relief, he said."

If necessary, the state government would also recommend a CBI inquiry into the issue, the chief minister said when presentations about sugarcane development department were made before him at his Lal Bahadur Shastri Bhawan office here late on Friday evening.Adityanath said nobody had any right to sell government properties at unreasonable prices.

Besides concession granted to undervalue the land and buildings of these sugar mills, no stamp duty was levied on the sale.The auditor had also observed that no competition was possible due to connection among the bidders. It noted that the bidders were aware of the expected value before the bidding was opened. Bids that were 50% below the expected value were kept alive and the Swiss challenge method was used.The process of opening the bids was changed, the CAG said, adding that the core group of secretaries on disinvestments did not value the land and the buildings appropriately and focused on the discounted cash flow method."

Though governments changed at the Centre and the state over the last 16 years, the project failed to kickstart.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has instructed all officials concerned to coordinate with the civil aviation ministry to get necessary approvals, so that the project is completed at the earliest. The project is crucial because it will help in bringing investment, setting up industries and creating jobs in the region along Yamuna Expressway, Suresh Rana, minister of state (Independent), sugarcane, sugar mills and industrial development, said.Officials hope that the project will be a reality soon as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power in both the Centre and the state.In the last 16 years, the mantle of administration at the Centre and the state passed from one party to another, delaying the project. Over the last five years of the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (SP) government, the project did not see much progress because of the dispute over airport location between the state and the Centre. While the state wanted the international airport near Agra, the Centre wanted it at Jewar. This kept delaying the ambitious project, said a senior official of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), which has the mandate to provide the 5,000 acres of land for the project.The Union government had, in July 2016, sought an obstacle limitation survey (OLS) of the airport site at Jewar from the state government. But the state is yet to send that report to the civil aviation ministry.The state was supposed to take a decision whether OLS will be done by the state or by YEIDA. Now, we will take a call and get it done soon, said Amarnath Upadhyaya additional chief executive officer of the YEIDA.Dr Mahesh Sharma, Union minister of state for tourism and culture also met UP CM Adityanath to discuss the airport project in Lucknow on Wednesday.Former chief minister Rajnath Singh had conceived this airport project in 2001. And our government will speed up the implementation of the project.

Umesh Raghuvanshi spoke to minister for finance Rajesh Agarwal on the challenges ahead.How challenging was the loan waiver decision?Loan waiver was certainly a challenge. The new government has just taken over. But we know the condition of states small and marginal farmers has deteriorated in the last few years. Natural calamities have left a direct impact on agriculture production and the condition of farmers.How will loan waiver be implemented?The BJP decided to bring out a Sankalp Patra instead of a poll manifesto. The BJP leadership resolved to fulfil the commitments mentioned in the Sankalp Patra. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the loan would be waived in the first meeting of state cabinet. No other party has made such a categorical commitment. We had long meetings with the chief minister, officers and banks etc. to find out the total loan amount. The CM proposed the loan waiver and the cabinet happily approved it. We have started the procedure to take this to the state assembly in the annual budget for 2017-2018 in the days to come.How will the government mobilise funds?The decision to waive loans of small and marginal farmers up to Rs 1 lakh has been taken. We are considering options. The Centre has already indicated it would not provide any direct assistance. We will find a way out.Will the government float kisan bonds?We will propose all options to the CM and go ahead with whatever decision he takes. We will come up with the decision in the Vidhan Sabha. We are committed to bringing about an improvement in the condition of farmers. The state cabinet has decided to write off the dues of seven lakh small and marginal farmers. We have brought one-time settlement (OTS) to bring these farmers to the mainstream and make their future secure. We will request the economists to suggest a way out.Are there other commitments too?We have to pay arrears of the seventh pay commission to state government employees. This will also put an additional burden on the state exchequer.What are other challenges that the government faces?We are switching over to the GST. Its a challenge but it is good for the state and traders. We will have to train the staff. We will ask respective departments to hold seminars and inform people about the advantages and disadvantages.Did the new government receive empty coffers?I am yet to see where the coffers are.Will there be inquiries against financial irregularities?Yes. We have come to know about irregularities in implementation of a number of schemes. There has been corruption. The CM has said there will be an inquiry in all such cases and those found guilty will be punished. There will be no political vendetta and we will not allow any public interest scheme to be affected. There will be no wastage of public money.Has the CM ordered an inquiry into the sale of 21 sugar mills under the BSP government?The CM has ordered an inquiry. The value of scrap would exceed the amount for which the sugar mills have been sold. The CM has also ordered action against the sugar mills that have not paid the dues of the farmers.Read more: If saffronisation means shaping talent of students, I am doing it, says BHU VC"

Even though it was initially thought that the deer died after drinking sewage water, post-mortem reports confirmed that quite a few died because of rabies. The rest could have died of heat-related ailments.There are no dogs inside the campus. So we suspect that it could have been spread by some infected mongoose. As the disease spreads through saliva, it might have spread after the infected deer licked the others wounds, said a zoo official.Measures to be taken by Delhi zoo to keep the animals cool Watermelon and bael to be given to fruit-eating animalsSugar-free kheer for bear, langur and chimpanzeesReduce diet of lion and tigers to 10kg from 12kgReplace breads with riceVitamin and mineral supplements for most animalsWater holes to be filled with water mixed with oral rehydration solutionsCoolers, fans and water sprinklers in cagesTreat wounds immediatelyAnti-rabies vaccination of deersThis time, however, not only have the zoo authorities vaccinated the spotted deer and sambar deer population they have also covered up the holes in the enclosures where mongooses could take shelter.The Indian Meteorological Department has already forecasted that the 2017 summer will be harsher and the next couple of months will see above normal temperatures.This summer is very crucial for us, as in the last summer there was a heavy death toll. We have already drawn up the summer management plan. We have made some changes in the diet and taken up a series of measures to keep the animals cool, said the official.While animals such as bear, langur and chimpanzees would be fed with sugar-free kheer, the daily meat-intake of large carnivores such as lions and tigers are being reduced from 12kg a day to around 10kg a day. Breads and rotis are being replaced with rice.The fruit-eaters, including birds and monkeys, would be given watermelons and bael mostly because both these fruits help keep the body cool and also increase the bodys water content.Most of the animals would be given vitamin and mineral supplements and the waterholes in all the cages would be filled up with water mixed with oral rehydration solutions, said the official.Coolers, fans and water sprinklers would be used to keep the cages cool and moist. Lawn nets would be also put up to provide shade from the scorching sun.Taking lessons from last years outbreak we have also planned to separate the deer herds in at least two enclosures so that in case of an outbreak the entire population is not affected, said the official.Zoo keepers have also been asked to remain extra vigilant and report if any deer or herbivore suffers any injuries because of fighting among themselves.An untreated wound in the peak summer season could trigger several diseases. Maggots too set in early during the summer, he added.Recently, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has alerted all zoos across India to take preventive measures to avert a possible outbreak of Trypanosomiasis  a protozoan disease that has, in the past, killed more than a dozen tigers and leopards in Indian zoos."

Hence, core CPI is a worry, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings.We expect CPI inflation to range between 4.5-5% for FY18 assuming a normal monsoon, he added.Last month, government data showed wholesale price index-based (WPI) inflation flared up to two-and-a-half years high of 6.55% in February from 5.25% in January mainly due to a spurt in mineral and fuel prices while food prices started rising following rapid remonetisation.Fearing a spurt in CPI and WPI inflation due to pent-up demand after demonetisation, the RBI tapered the remonetisation pace in March.The increase in currency being circulated was 5.9% week-on-week in January 13. It slowed to 4.6% in February 10, and further to 4% on March 10.Latest Reserve Bank of India data shows that the currency in circulation increased by 1.7% week-on-week to Rs 13.35 lakh crore as on March 31, 2017.The RBI also kept policy lending rate unchanged at its April policy review but hiked the reverse repo to suck out extra cash from banks.Between January 2015 and March 2017, the RBI has lower rates by 175 bps while the government has stepped up spending and speeded up reforms to pump prime the economy amid a feeble global recovery.CSO has projected economic growth is projected at 7.1% for 2016-17 as compared with 7.9% in 2015-16, on expectation of a fall out of demonetisation on the consumption demand during the second half of the fiscal year."

The waiver will cost the state exchequer around Rs 3,500 crore.The farmers having outstanding power bills of Rs 10,000 or more will be allowed to pay the same in four installments, the cabinet decided.It also decided to ensure that transformers were changed in 48-hours, instead of 72 hours, in rural areas and within 24 hours in the urban areas.The farmers will not be required to transport the malfunctioning transformers to the power station. This would be responsibility of the power corporation officials, Sharma said.A memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed under the union governments power for all project in the presence of Yogi Adityanath and union power minister Piyush Goyal in Lucknow on April 14, the minister said.The pact will be inked to meet the Centres target of making the state energy efficient by 2018.Relief for potato farmersThe cabinet decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potato at Rs 487 per quintal to protect the interest of potato farmers.The government wants to give adequate price to potato growers. Even if we cannot give them profit, we will ensure they do not incur loss, Sharma said.He said district magistrates were asked to set up procurement centres wherever needed.If the previous SP regime had played a proactive role, the condition of potato growers would have been better, he added.Sugarcane dues to be paid in 14 daysThe government also made it mandatory to clear the current dues of the sugarcane growers within 14 days and previous dues within 120 days.Legal action will be initiated against sugar mills if they fail to make payments, Sharma said.Steps to end shortage of building materialsThe state cabinet also decided to amend the Uttar Pradesh Minor Minerals Rules, 1963, in a bid to end the shortage of sand and coarse sand, which is adversely impacting construction activities.Health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state cabinet had constituted a committee, headed by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, at its last meeting to look into the issue.The committee had submitted its report, he said.The state government will allow transportation of minor minerals with valid transit permits from other states.As a short term measure, district magistrates will issue e-tenders to allocate up to 10-acre area for sand mining for six months. He said short term measures had been initiated as implementation of long-term measures may take six to eight months."

And its making waves in literary circles across the world. Published in March this year, Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows is flying off the book shelves in places as far apart as Melbourne and London. A dark but heart-warming comedy, the novel delves into the lives of Punjabi widows, who may have spent a lifetime being dutiful in the shadows of their fathers, husbands and brothers, but whose white dupattas hide their rich and colourful inner lives.Balli Kaur Jaswal, the 33-year-old author born in Singapore, is no stranger to literary acclaim. In 2014, she was named the Best Young Australian Novelist by Sydney Morning Herald for her debut novel Inheritance. Her second novel Sugarbread was a finalist for Singapores 2015 Epigram Books Fiction Prize. Her current work was inspired by the time she spent in Southall.Balli Kaur Jaswal, author of the novel Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows (HT Photo)According to The Bookseller, HarperCollins bagged Erotic Stories in a strong six-figure deal after staving off five other publishers to win the title at an auction. Director Sir Ridley Scotts production company, Scott Free Productions and Film4, which produced The Martian, has bought the film rights to the book.Jaswal, whose father was in the foreign services, has lived all around the world, including Australia, Japan, Russia, the Philippines, Turkey, the US and the UK, but her Punjabi upbringing is at the heart of all her three novels.Erotic stories follows Nikki, the 22-year-old self-appointed fem fighter who starts a creative writing class for women in a Southall gurdwara. To her dismay, the barely literate middle-aged and elderly women in her class are not interested in her feminist talk. But as they begin to open up, they start sharing steamy stories about their womanhood, sexuality, and hilarious escapades. Soon, Nikki realises that their stories may place them at a risk in a community policed by a group of unemployed men called the Brothers.The book has received a warm response from reviewers. The Economist writes: Ms Jaswal has written a funny and moving tale of desire and its discontents. It serves as a reminder that even the most traditional societies often come in 50 shades of grey. Strongly recommending the novel, The Straits Times writes: If you like your erotica with a social conscience, this is the book for you.Jaswal, who teaches English, turned to writing after receiving the David TK Wong writer-in-residence fellowship at the University of East Anglia, UK, in 2007. She has also received a writing fellowship from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.Hailed as a leading voice of the Punjabi diaspora in Singapore, Jaswals first two novels are set in the island nation. Inheritance revolves around the mental illness of Amrit, the protagonist, who disappears in the middle of the night, only to return as a different person. Nobody in her conservative Punjabi family knows how to tackle her problem and their attempts to do so result in disastrous consequences.Sugarbread is the coming-of-age story of Pin, a Punjabi girl growing up in Singapore, and trying to find out a secret about her mother. The book also tackles racism, and how hurtful it is even if its rooted in ignorance. Pin, for instance, is forbidden from wearing her kara (Sikh article of faith) during soccer practice.

Many people say I am saffron-clad, so there are many in the country who are averse to saffron, Adityanath said in an interview to RSS affiliated weekly Organiser.Noting that for him power was not for fun and frolic, he said, We are not in politics to run after prestigious positions and posts.Listing out the priorities of his government, Adityanath said protection of rashtra (nation) will be the main dharma (religion) of his government.This is focal point of humanity. In UP, we will provide corruption-free administration and rid the society of goonda raj, he said, adding plans have been made and their impact will be visible in the next two months.A new industrial policy will be in place to check migration of people from the state and it would make sure that 90% of the employees in any industrial unit were from within Uttar Pradesh, he said.Promising to clear the dues of sugarcane farmers within 14 days, Adityanath announced five-six new sugar mills will be opened in the state over the next six months."

Together they eat enough food in a week to feed two families of four for a month. Their parents are so poor, the rest of the village pitches in to feed them.Dr Lakdawala told HT that as in Emans case, a gene mutation was responsible for the childrens severe obesity.The cause of the Nandwana siblings obesity  a mutation in the leptin receptor protein (LEPR) gene  was revealed by a genetic marker test conducted in Gujarat.There is currently no specific treatment for this condition. However, a drug called MC4R Agonist, only available through a pharmaceutical company in the US, could help Eman and the three children. The drug has been tested on three paediatric patients. We are trying to convince US officials to conduct the trial in India, said Dr Lakdawala.

There is not much work here but I work as a labourer and my wife works on a farm, said Ramesh, the father of the children. They earn about Rs 5,000 a month, which isnt enough to cover even the childrens food expenses  Rs6,000 to Rs7,000 a month.The entire village helps us to feed the children. Some give us rotis while others help out with gravy, said Ramesh. The children consume milk worth Rs 100, more than 30 rotis, and more than a kilo of vegetables every day. They also need biscuits, wafers and other snacks every half an hour to prevent them from becoming cranky.As the family  from Vajdi village in Gujarats Una district  awaits a response from the hospital, the childrens parents Ramesh and Pradnya are working tirelessly to ensure they dont go hungry.Read: Eman Ahmed vs Daulatram Jogawat: Two obese patients with different treatmentEarlier they would cry and howl if they didnt get food. But two years ago they were admitted to Ahmedabad civil hospital for 20 days. The food and the injections they received caused them to despise their hospital stay. Now they dont cry for food, fearing they will be sent back to the hospital, but they are still hungry all the time, Ramesh added.Dr Akshay Mandviya from Mandviya Childrens Hospital was the first to treat the siblings. She suspects that they have a genetic disorder known as Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a complex condition affects many parts of the body and causes Type-2 diabetes and obesity.We really dont have the resources to diagnose the children but they used to come to us with other ailments such as pneumonia or fever. They could be treated if there was something wrong with their hormone levels but if its a genetic problem, nothing much can be done, said Dr Mandviya. He added that after local media highlighted the plight of the family, Ahmedabad Civil Hospital offered to treat them.However, Dr K M Maheria, head of paediatrics at Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, said even they couldnt diagnose the problem. We dont have an endocrinologist but we did put the children on a diet. We saw a slight weight reduction but we couldnt provide any specific treatment, said Dr Maheria. He added that he has spoken to Dr Lakdawala about the childrens condition.Ramesh said that taking the children to a hospital when there was nothing medically wrong with them didnt make sense. I thought it was better to focus on working and earning enough to feed them. They need a diet of fruit juices and salads but we cant afford it, he said. Two years ago, he had said he would sell a kidney to feed his children."

He directed the officials to settle the pending payments of sugarcane farmers in the next 15 days, and prepare a comprehensive strategy in the new sowing season.The priest-turned-politician also drew the attention of the officials towards denotified tribes and asked them to conduct a survey to gauge whether the tribals have availed the state schemes.

I had been a very active person physically, but I also used to smoke heavily. Then all of a sudden, there were all these restrictions on me... it was not easy to stop smoking. Overnight, beef and fish fry just disappeared from the dining table. It was frustrating being told that I had to be on aspirin and statins for the rest of my life, he says.The first few months were torturous, being made to feel an invalid and having all his activities and meals supervised. But his natural ebullience took over after a while.Second chanceIt just hit me that I had been given a second chance at life and I wasnt going to waste it. It has been 14 years since that episode and I have been enjoying my life, he says.It is not a smooth sail for everyone though.Avoid stressThe initial days will pass in a haze when the patient is busy with the treatment. Then slowly, the implications of the heart attack hits them. Many feel that it is the end of their life, career, and sex life and they sink into depression. This is the time when the patient needs the maximum support and reassurance from his family and the doctor. Follow your doctors orders on medication and lifestyle moderation, and reduce stress. You can have a normal family life like any person soon, says G. Vijayaraghavan, noted cardiologist.A small minority  10-20%  however, may not have made a good recovery from the initial heart attack.Those who may have suffered a major heart attack involving larger portions of the heart muscle, weakening of the valves, pumping failure or those who may have come out of the episode with multiple stents or a cardiac bypass surgery may need special care.Average ageIn Kerala, the average age of incidence of a heart attack is approximately 50 years, at least 10 years younger than the Western population.Most people would be at the most productive phase of their career when they suddenly find themselves incapacitated.After a heart attack, there is an immediate behavioural and lifestyle change, which slackens after a while. About 10-15% of the patients will continue to smoke. More dangerously, some will stop the medication on their own when they find that their lipid and sugar levels are normal, says S. Harikrishnan, Additional Professor of Cardiology, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology. But if secondary prevention is managed well, then the chances of recurrence are remote, he says.A heart attack is often a life-changing event for some. They may suddenly turn spiritual . Some others may remain anxious about a recurrence.DepressionBut some people can really sink into depression, affecting the quality of their lives.Depression itself can be a risk factor for cardiac mortality because depressed individuals may not take care of themselves.This is why cardiac rehabilitation  reclaiming ones physical and psychological fitness  is extremely important. In the West, these are six- to 12-week sessions during which patients are put through physical activities and counselling under professional supervision so that they can easily go back to normal life. In our settings, though doctors regularly counsel their patients about all aspects, there are few organised cardiac rehab programmes and this is a major deficiency, Dr. Harikrishnan says.For all heart attack survivors, the most important lifestyle change will be the chronic medication regime.Drug regimenIt is extremely important that one follows the drug regimen without fail for life even if ones lipid and sugar levels are normal because blockages can happen in other vessels too.Look after your lifestyle and take your medicines promptly. There may be some restrictions but occasional indulgences are also fine . I would always want my patients to enjoy their life, Dr. Vijayaraghavan says.(Reporting by C. Maya)"

However, as the number of protesters increased on the fourth and fifth day, the volume of food prepared too scaled up and the garbage mounted everywhere.Empty pet bottles, sachets, rotten vegetables and leftover food were strewn all over the Grounds, some of the conservancy workers and supervisory staff told The Hindu team on Monday night. With sudden rain on Sunday, a portion of the venue looked like a war zone. On the one side, the temporary toilets were choked and on the other, inadequate water forced many to look for toilets outside.Thus, the surrounding areas and the roads leading to Gandhi Museum and the one towards the Government Law College were converted into open urinals by some of the protesters.That the women protesters had a tough time is a different story.Even the police, on duty, had a tough time as there were no pay-and-use toilets in the vicinity. Deploying 75 conservancy workers and a dozen sanitary inspectors exclusively, the Corporation swung into action since Monday night and cleaned up the area. According to Deputy Commissioner Shanti, they lifted about 50 tonnes of garbage from the Tamukkum Grounds alone and the cleaning went on till the early morning of Tuesday.Only the day after Pongal, the Corporation had lifted a little over 100 tonnes from locations where sugarcane was sold by vendors, in addition to the normal garbage of around 600 tonnes from the 100 wards.The operation clean Tamukkum Grounds was a new experience for the local body since it was occupied by force for more than a week by protesters. The expenditure incurred by way of cleaning and use of electricity was borne by the government is a different story altogether."

Farmers here said they had gone ahead with heavy investments for raising the crops in anticipation of rainfall.Implementation of the Pandiyaru-Punnambazha scheme would be the only long-term solution for preventing recurrence of drought in the district, a farmer said, while narrating the inability of agriculturists to find fodder for their livestock due persistent dry conditions. The team finally visited Samigoundanpalayam village to assess the damage to turmeric crop.On Wednesday, the team will visit Surapalayam and Moolakarai in Erode block to estimate damage to tapioca, turmeric and tomato crops, and Thalayampalayam, Karukkupalayam and Bolanaickenpalayam in Perundurai block to analyse drought impact on groundnut, cotton and maize crops.(Reporting by Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

It is a Vijay Mallya-like case in Karnataka. The Congress government has enabled its leader to obtain huge sums of loan by throwing all rules to the winds, he charged.Besides, Lakshmis brother has been allotted 15 mega watt-capacity solar power generation project by the government. Her brother has submitted 10 online application forms for the project in a span of 59 seconds to obtain the projects. It is a biggest fraud in the government in the name of farmers, he charged.We also have information that Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd has purchased large quantity of coal from an Indonesian company.

""He nailed it. He knocked it out of the park.""Several women attending were pleased to hear Trump open by acknowledging Black History Month and condemn recent threats against Jewish community centers.""He's being professional, very professional,"" said Marie King of St. Petersburg, Florida.The approbation began beforehand, with a rally on the sidewalk outside, as supporters waved signs reading ""America First"" and ""Florida for Trump.""They were mostly greeted by honking horns of approval, but also a few passing drivers who shouted expletives.Trump, a Republican, won 46 percent of the national popular vote, two percentage points behind Democrat Hillary Clinton but good enough in the state-by-state results that determine the winner in the Electoral College.Nationally, his approval rating has sagged to a low level for a new president, around 44 percent, according to an average of recent polls by Real Clear Politics. Trump has been shaken by investigations into his campaign's possible ties to Russia, his own misstatements about his levels of support, and a federal court's halt to his executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations.Those setbacks had little bearing at the Quaker Steak and Lube, a motorcycle- and auto racing-themed establishment that boasts ""Best Wings USA.""Clearwater, on the Gulf Coast, sits in Pinellas County in the heart of battleground Florida.Trump, a part-time Floridian, flipped the results from the last two presidential election in Pinellas County in his favor after former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, carried the county in 2008 and 2012.Any advantage is crucial in Florida, where the past four statewide elections have been decided by about one percentage point.Pinellas County forms part of the Interstate 4 highway corridor linking the Tampa and Orlando media markets. Republican Mitt Romney won that corridor by one point over Obama in 2012, but Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in that same stretch by 6 points, according to a study led by Susan MacManus, a professor of government at the University of South Florida.Known for its miles of sugar sand beaches, the county has long been a retirement destination, especially among those leaving the Midwest.Speaking just before the address, Ron Sanders, 65, a Baptist pastor living in nearby Seminole, Florida, wanted to hear Trump tackle illegal immigration, which the president did. He also hoped Trump's speech would help to bring in line moderate Republican senators who have been critical of some of his early efforts, which is not yet certain.""He's sticking to what he said. It's not discouraging Trump at all,"" said Sanders, wearing a cowboy hat colored like an American flag. ""He's going full guns ahead.""Jackie Amadio, who works in healthcare administration and lives in Seminole, has been very pleased with Trump's first weeks and saw no need for him to soften his tone.Wearing a pink polo shirt and white shorts, she held up an ""America First"" sign and gave thumbs up at drivers honking in support.""I don't want sweet words anymore,"" she said, smacking her hands together. ""Tell it like it is."""

PTI file photoAfter a temporary respite in January, retail price inflation surged again in February as food prices went up. Consumer price inflation (CPI) moved up to 3.65% in February from 3.17% in January. Food items have 46% weight in the CPI basket.But vegetable prices showed a declining trend majorly due to the demonetisation-induced distress sale of vegetables, in addition to seasonal factors. Vegetable price inflation at retail level was recorded at 8.29% in February.The Reserve Bank of India said it was possible that with significant remonetisation having taken place, there could be some reversal in vegetable prices in March and beyond.Price rise in fruit was higher at 8.33% and in fuel at 3.9% in February. The rate of price rise in meat and fish was 3.5%.Prices of sugar and confectionery items in the food basket rose by 18.83%. Inflation in milk and milk products too increased by 4.22%.Prices of housing, health, education, transport and communication which together account for over 30% of the CPI basket remained high, implying that the discretionary consumer spending continued to be affected by demonetisation.In the case of pulses, a record production of kharif pulses at 8.7 million tonnes, after two consecutive years of monsoon and crop failures, helped in sharp reduction in prices  prices crashed even below the minimum support prices (MSPs) in some mandis."

He said the suspect used to watch the writers show on a popular television channel and keep tab on his movement in India. The official said some of Fatahs activities and statements had been criticised by Muslim groups.The four suspects, however, gradually realised and it was not easy to target the writer so they also prepared an alternative plan to target some more places and persons to show their presence, said the official.Asim Arun, inspector general (IG) of police, ATS, said the writer was one the terror suspects targets but they dropped the idea as they were unable to track his movements.Arun said they later planned to target a Shia worship place in Amrohas Naugawa Saadat. He added that an alert has been sounded in Amroha, Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar after startling revelations made by Mufti alias Faizan (who was arrested from Bijnore) and Zaqwan alias Ehtesham (who was arrested from Narkatiyaganj, Bihar), during rigorous interrogation.Faizan and Ehtesham were on Saturday taken on eight-day remand by ATS sleuths for further quizzing. The two other suspects, Umar and Ghazi Baba (who was arrested from Jalandhar), were produced in the court of special chief judicial magistrate on Monday after being brought to Lucknow on transit remand. The court sent them to judicial custody till May 4. The ATS will move court on Tuesday to seek their police remand.The IG said the terror suspects had planned a bomb attack at some crowded place in Haridwar, Uttarakhand during some holy gathering. He said they also had plans to eliminate a police officer in Mumbai and set ablaze a sugar mill in Narkatiyaganj, Bihar. They were also planning to target some gas cylinder shop or battery shop located in a crowded place so that it could cause major damage, he said.Arun confirmed that the four suspects had even made advance payments to two persons of Bijnore to arrange gunpowder, firearms and ammunitions to be used for the attack but they were arrested before they could carry out their plan.Read more| Uttar Pradesh on alert: Police warn of spectacular attacks by ISI-trained sadhus"

After training at the academy, the children participate in district-level competitions, followed by state-level events.Sarita Bhise is from Dhuldev, a small tribal village in Mann Taluka in Satara district. Enrolled in a primary school, she could never attend classes throughout the year. Her parents belonged to a shepherds community and she often had to travel to Latur in search of grasslands for the cattle, forcing her school education to take a backseat.When she did attend school, which was five kilometres from her house, Sarita often ran all the way. It was her sports teacher who noticed she was good in athletics, and selected her to undergo training at the Mann Deshi Champions Sports Academy (MDCSA) that provides free-of-cost sports training to rural children. Today, 13-year-old Sarita plays field hockey at the national level and is part of Krida Prabodhini in Balewadi, Pune.MDCSA, an initiative of the Mann Deshi Foundation in Mhaswad in Satara, was established in 2011 to encourage rural children to take up sports as a career, and train them for state and district-level sports competitions. So far, the academy has trained more than 1,000 athletes, of whom 32 were selected to play at the national level. Interestingly, the participation of girls has been increasing at an encouraging rate, informed Chetna Sinha, founder-president, Mann Deshi Foundation.Reshma Kewate, a student of Class XII, used to take buffaloes to graze to a grassy spot four kilometres from her house. She spent hours running after the buffaloes, making her legs stronger. After undergoing the Academys rigorous training schedule and following its nutritional guidelines, she started participating in 5-km, 10-km and half marathon races. She has won several marathons and also been selected for national-level athletics events.The facilities offered by the Academy include a 400-metre running track, ground for volleyball/field hockey/soccer /handball, sports equipments, coaches, sports shoes and kit, nutrition-rich breakfasts, annual medical check-ups, winter camps with specialised trainers from Mumbai/Pune, and leadership development opportunities.The children at the academy hail from schools across 15 villages of the taluka. They are identified and selected for the academy by school teachers when they are in primary classes. Once they receive training at the academy, they participate in district-level competitions, followed by state-level competitions. The selected candidates get admission to Krida Prabodhini, Balewadi, which trains them for national-level competitions, said Sinha.According to Sinha, children from the Academy perform well in sports because of their social background and upbringing, which makes them strong. The children come from such remote areas even primary school students have to walk for one-two kilometres to reach their school. They get physically tough and this makes them potential athletes. They are used to working hard as they are either from the shepherd community or their parents work in sugarcane plantations, said Sinha.In 2012, of the 210 students selected for Krida Prabodhini from Maharashtra, 165 were from Satara district and in 2013, of the 43 students selected for Krida Prabodhini from Maharashtra, 42 were from Satara district.Promising sportspersonSarita Bhise: Played in national-level hockey tournaments.

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) A 22-year-old resident of east Delhi knows first-hand what it is like to fall into the trap at a young age. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)Cut, samaan or maal  these are words that a 38-year-old real estate broker wants to forget. What started as an experiment with a pinch of heroin 14 years ago has now hijacked his life. Lodged at a south Delhi de-addiction centre for the sixth time in seven years, the father of two is trying to get rid of a habit that has cost him family ties and his business. I started abusing drugs when I was in Class X. The guard in my school gave it to me, saying it was bhole ki booti. I dont remember if it was heroin, charas or ganja, he says.Clad in a T-shirt and jeans, he sits in a room at the de-addiction centre for a counselling session. I am very familiar with this place; the doctors and staff know me. But this is the last time I want to come here, he says.Over the past three years, police sources say, the demand for drugs, especially cocaine and heroin, has been increasing in the city. While the former is out of reach for many due to its high cost, heroin  especially its adulterated version known as smack  is much more accessible.The cost of 1 kg heroin in the international market is about Rs 4 crore. In Delhi, as all over the world, the drug is adulterated  or cut  using sugar, coffee and several compounds. One gram is sold in Delhi for about Rs 200-Rs 300 in various hotspots, which include JJ clusters and parks. Cocaine, on the other hand, is 15 to 20 times more expensive. Brown sugar or smack is very common in Delhi, mostly among youngsters. It is often mixed with various pharmaceutical drugs that are illegally sold over the counter. Addicts inhale, snort or inject the drug.In February this year, the Delhi Police busted a gang in Shahdaras Seemapuri area and recovered 273.45 grams of smack worth Rs 7.5 lakh in the international market. The gang would sell 2,000 packets (each containing 1 gram heroin) of the contraband in a single day. The peddlers got their supply of heroin from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh. Police had claimed that the accused were selling heroin packets to almost 4,000-5,000 boys in the area. In the case, police had identified 18 boys who were addicted to heroin. Three of them were minors.A 22-year-old resident of east Delhi knows first-hand what it is like to fall into the trap at a young age. He says he has to inject 10 ml of a mixture of heroin and anti-allergens into his veins every day, else he experiences severe withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, aches and pains in the bones, insomnia, diarrhea, and vomiting.I started smoking cigarettes when I was in Class IX. I quickly moved on to beer, whisky, ganja, charas and eventually cut smack. I can buy a days fix in a small pouch for Rs 200. I mix it with Avil (anti-allergic medicine). Ten ml of the mixture is sufficient for me, he says.He, too, has been in and out of de-addiction centres. This is my fourth time at the centre. After each three-month course, I end up in the same environment  the same friends and the same temptations. I want to get rid of this habit, he says.A transit pointOver the years, owing to accessibility and relative anonymity, Delhi has become a transit point for international drug peddlers. Police sources say that presently there are three big hubs of heroin  southwest Asia, southeast Asia and India.Heroin is an opioid  a drug derived from opium. Cultivation of poppy for opium is allowed in some parts of India, Turkey and Australia. While countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan have banned the cultivation, the plant is still grown extensively in some areas, police say. Opium is used to make morphine  a purified form of which is used to make a strong painkiller. Morphine is also used to make heroin.In India, police say, heroin comes from Rajasthans Kota, Jhalawar, Bara, Chittorgarh, Pratapgarh and Udaipur, Madhya Pradeshs Bhawani, Mandi, Mandsaur, Indore and Neemuch and Uttar Pradeshs Bareilly, Barabanki and Badaun and some parts of Jharkhand. Police sources say heroin is also smuggled in from Afghanistan and Pakistan via Amritsar. Cocaine  extracted from the leaves of Coca plants  comes to Delhi from west African countries via Mumbai and Goa, police say. Police have also noticed the increasing trend of involvement of foreign nationals and women in the drug trade. According to officials at the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), women belonging to middle class families take to trafficking as their relatives are involved in the trade.Director of the Delhi Zonal Unit (NCB), Madho Singh, told The Indian Express that they have identified two routes via which heroin is supplied to Delhi and other parts of India  border route and air route.Due to tension at the border, smuggling via this route has decreased of late. But a new trend is being noticed  drugs are being smuggled by air passengers. The carrier swallows capsules filled with the drugs. Once they land in the country, the drugs are extracted. However, our intelligence network helps us nab such carriers, says Singh, adding that the unit is working towards procuring a full body scanner at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.Sources say the government has asked security agencies to create a database of persons who have been arrested in connection with drug trade. The government has also directed that information about such peddlers or rackets be shared between the agencies.Deputy Commissioner of Police (narcotics and crime) Rajesh Deo told The Indian Express, We are in the process of developing more human intelligence to delve deeper into the peddling racket. We are developing various mechanisms for this purpose. Low income areas are majorly affected by drug peddling and we will soon launch awareness programmes there.Rise of party drugsBesides heroin, police say the most commonly abused drugs in Delhi are ganja (marijuana), charas (cannabis), cocaine, opium, buprenorphine, nitrazepam, phenegran, diazepam, mandrax, amphetamine, morphine, pentazocin, pseudoephedrine and codine. Use of smack and ganja gained impetus as it is cheaper than other drugs. Most of the addicts are street children, people living in shelters and adolescents from the lower classes, says a police officer, who works in the narcotics department of Delhi Police.In the recent past, another trend has emerged  an increase in the use of party drugs such as LSD (acid/blotter), MDMA (ecstasy/eve/lovers speed, peace), GHB (liquid ecstasy/scoop) and mephedrone (meow meow) in the capital.Police sources say these drugs are being used in tandem with alcohol  drugs and alcohol are taken alternatively to give a high which lasts for several hours. The alternative dosage of alcohol and the drug has a spiraling effect, which is further fuelled by high-pitch trance music at rave parties. Though such parties are not common in Delhi, the increase in the type and quantity of party drugs in Delhi is dangerous, says an officer.Another officer says the dog squad unit will soon see the addition of two new sniffer dogs, who will be trained exclusively for the purpose of detecting drugs. The squad has dogs which are trained to detect drugs as well as explosives, but we need to train dogs to sniff out drugs exclusively, he says.Going cleanAccording to doctors, heroin is highly addictive  using the drug a few times is all it takes for people to get addicted. Quitting is tough because of the painful withdrawal symptoms.The real estate dealer testifies to this. I am married and have two young children. Most people dont understand the struggle. I dont want to live in this drug-induced haze. Even my children have repeatedly asked me to quit this habit. It is heartbreaking. I want to lead a good life. I keep joining de-addiction centres but I cannot remain sober for long. The urge to use is too strong, he says.He says that he had reported to police and other agencies about the illegal sale of heroin in his area to no avail. At least 40 per cent of youngsters in my area are addicts. Many times, I have alerted police about the trade but nothing has been done. Also, tablets and medicines (used to cut the drug) are being easily sold over the counter in medical stores, he says.According to a doctor at the centre, the company an addict keeps and the environment he lives in during and after treatment are important. Once a patient completes the treatment, he should avoid coming in contact with the same circle of friends or people with whom he used to take drugs says the doctor. He adds, While some get over the addiction soon after the first treatment, others require multiple treatments.Talking about how the misuse of pharmaceutical products is on the rise in the capital, another doctor says people mix a small quantity of heroin with readily-available medicines from pharmacies.Police, however, say misuse of pharmaceutical products comes under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, and only the government has the power to take action. We can only inform the administration, which we always do when such an activity comes to our notice. We can only seize, arrest and investigate the banned drugs under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act, a police officer says. Under the law, a person booked under the Act may face imprisonment up to 10 years or more. The quantum of punishment is also based on the quantity of banned drugs recovered from his or her possession.From Afghanistan to the capitalMarch 2017Special Cell arrests two, recover heroin worth Rs 8 crore.

Coca-Cola said it also is expanding its cost-cutting program to reach $800 million annually by 2019.While the job cuts will clearly be difficult for those impacted, these changes are critical for us to create an environment where we can accelerate growth and become the consumer-centric, total beverage company we need to be in a fast-changing world, incoming chief executive James Quincey said in a statement.Net income in the first quarter plunged to $1.2 billion, down 20.3% from the year-ago period.Revenues fell 11.3% to $9.1 billion, reflecting lower sales from bottlers that were sold to franchisees as part of a corporate reorganization.One-time costs associated with the bottling refranchising also dented earnings.Volumes were flat globally, including in North America, the biggest region by revenue, and fell three percent in Latin America due to weakness in Brazil and Venezuela.Coca-Cola aims to deliver a more consumer-centric portfolio that meets peoples changing tastes and preferences, said Quincey, who will become chief executive next month.New product offerings include Honest Sport, a sports drink that is an offshoot of the low-sugar Honest Tea. The company also is launching Coca-Cola Plus in Japan, a no-sugar drink with dietary fiber aimed at Japans large aging population.Importantly, these portfolio changes will help our consumers moderate the amount of added sugar they consume.Coca-Cola shares dipped 0.2% to $43.19 in afternoon trading."

For his bereaved family, the drought  said to be the worst in the last 140 years  has been more of an extended nightmare that refuse to end. Apart from its principal bread earner, the family is also without any dependable source of income. To compound their troubles, the family also has to pay back Rs 1.5 lakh and interests on the loan that Palaniswami had taken from the money lender.P Prabhakaran, his 30-year-old son, finds the burden of unpaid loan and the task of looking after two of his mentally-challenged siblings almost unbearable. Whatever I earn as an employee of a private firm, Rs 10,000 goes for repayment of the interest component of the loan. The loan amount is still there and I may have to work till my death and I would still be paying the interest, he complained between shedding tears.Thousands of farming families across Tamil Nadu  particularly in the Cauvery Delta  are facing a similar bleak future. Not all are strong enough to shoulder the burden and scores of farmers are capitulating under pressure, ending their lives.As crops wither and hopes of repaying loans recede, more farmers are taking the extreme step, points out farmers leader P Ayyakannu. The state government in an RTI reply admitted to 82 farmer deaths since October last year. But farmers organisations say hundreds have actually died, saying 500 would be a more accurate toll.The drive from Chennai to Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, winding through parched fields of wilting sugar cane and withering coconut plantations, is bumpy and distressing. At almost every road, hump and sharp turns, some family or the other has a heart-rending story to narrate.Raju Tirumala narrates the depressing circumstances under which his wife Lakshmi killed herself, becoming the first woman farmer in the state to commit suicide. T Alagesans family recounts that he died a broken man, unable to withstand either the drought or debt.As against the normal rainfall of 440mm during the north-east monsoon which brings the bulk of the rain, the state received a mere 168mm of rainfall this year. The south-west monsoons failed too, leaving TN drier.A beleaguered state government has declared all 32 districts as drought affected and sought Rs 39,565 crore relief package from the Centre. It has been sanctioned only Rs 2,014 crore though, based on recommendations of the inter-ministerial central team.Help isnt forthcoming from the authorities and the farming community is agitated. Farmers are dying everywhere and there is no one willing to stop it, laments Arokya Mary, the grieving widow of Alagesan.Even Palaniswamis son Prabhakaran is livid. The police FIR lodged after Palaniswamis death mentioned suicide as the cause but the state government has so far not bothered to pay any compensation. It seems no one cares for the dying farmers, he said, in between working hard to repay his fathers debt."

Sporting Senas flags, they allegedly raised slogans against Pakistan and also targeted the Centre and the Jammu and Kashmir government, officials said.They also burnt an effigy of the BJP-led NDA government at sugar mill crossing. Protesters alleged that Pakistans ISI was sponsoring terror attacks on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir while the Union government was soft-pedalling to save the state government in which the BJP was a coalition partner.Our army and paramilitary jawans are being targeted by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists in order to destabilise India and create fear psychosis.

But it is not difficult if you are Lakshmi R Hebbalkar, president, Karnataka Mahila Congress.A consortium of seven co-operative banks, with Apex Bank as the leader bank, has sanctioned a term loan of Rs 215 crore against a total security of 51 acres of industrial land worth not over Rs 1.69 crore in Savadatti taluk of Belagavi district. The huge term loan was offered to Harsha Sugars Pvt Ltd of which Lakshmi is the managing director.The income tax department had raided the premises belonging to Lakshmi and Minister for Small Scale Industries Ramesh L Jarkiholi in January this year. The documents pertaining to Harsha Sugars were also under the scanner. A close examination of the documents relating to the businesses of Harsha Sugars, which were accessed by DH, revealed that the consortium of seven co-operative banks had sanctioned the term loan seven months after the company acquired 51 acres in Savadatti taluk.After the purchase of the land, Harsha Sugars had got the clearance of the state high-level clearance committee headed by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, in June 2015.The documents show that the term loan agreement was executed between the consortium of co-operative banks and Harsha Sugars on October 13, 2015 and a supplementary deed of equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds was executed on December 16, 2015.In both the agreements, Harsha Sugars, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, was represented by its managing director Lakshmi R Hebbalkar and director Channaraj B Hattiholi, Lakshmi's brother.The consortium of banks is led by Karnataka State Co-operative Apex Bank (Rs 50 crore) and six other co-operative banks which are: The South Canara District Central Co-operative Bank Kodialbail, Mangaluru (Rs 30 crore), The Bajpe Vyavasaya Seva Sahakari Bank, Bajpe, Dakshina Kannada (Rs 20 crore), The Bagalkot District Central Co-operative Bank of Bagalkot (Rs 40 crore), The Bijapur District Central Co-operative Bank of Solapur (Rs 25 crore), The Tumkur District Central Co-operative Bank, Tumakuru (Rs 25 crore) and The Kanara District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd in Sirsi Uttara Kannada district (Rs 25 crore).Interestingly, Sri Vishwakarma Urban Credit Souharda Sahakari Niyamit of Gokak district and The Bangalore, Bangalore Rural and Ramanagar District Central Co-operative Bank, Chamarajpet, Bengaluru, which were part of the consortium in October 2015 opted out of it in the deed executed in December 2015. The two banks had sanctioned Rs 25 crore each to Harsha Sugars on September 28 and September 11 respectively.The board of directors of Harsha Sugars had appointed Lakshmi and Hattiholi to approach the leader bank (Apex Bank) and the other banks, seeking sanction of Rs 215 crore loan to set up 5,000 TCD sugar plant with 30 MW co-gen power plant at survey number 411 at Savadatti village in Belagavi district. The lands pledged as security for the loan are in survey numbers 411/1 (4.02 acres), 411/2 (4.2 acres), 411/3 (4.1 acres), 412 (17.01 acres) and 413/1 (22.06 acres).Hebbalkar didnt respond to several calls made by DH to her personal mobile phone. In response to a message texted to her phone, she replied that she would call back.Land conversion in a jiffyA certain Panchanagouda Basanagouda Dymanagoudar had purchased the entire 51 acres of agricultural land from different farmers in Savadatti for Rs 1 lakh per acre in December 2014. After buying the land, he filed an application with the Belagavi deputy commissioner seeking conversion of the land for industrial purpose. The application was filed on February 12, 2015 and the order sanctioning conversion was passed on February 26. In March 2015, Dymanagoudar sold the entire land to Harsha Sugars."

However, in the Union Budget proposals for 2017-18, this subsidy component was withdrawn, indicating that the entire burden of subsidised sugar will have to be borne by the states.Khader said the Karnataka government has written to the Centre to restore its share of subsidy immediately. At present, 10,000 tonnes of sugar a month is distrubuted through PDS at a cost of Rs 15 per kg.The state is not in a position to bear the entire subsidy on its own and will be forced to withdraw supply of sugar through PDS from April this year, the minister said.BPL ration card holders in rural areas will get one litre of kerosene a month even if they have LPG connections, Khader said. As many as 40 lakh card holders with LPG connections will benefit. They will have to enrol at the respective gram panchayats stating that they are interested in availing kerosene. The fuel will be charged at Rs 25 a litre and provided from March. Supply of kerosene to households with LPG connections was discontinued in 1995.Food and Civil Supplies Department Principal Secretary Harsh Gupta urged all ration card holders to link their cards to Aadhaar at the earliest. Aadhaar seeding of ration cards has been mandatory and ration supply will be cut if it is not done within the next few weeks, he said.As many as 50,000 applications have been received online for new APL cards since January this year and 30,000 of them have been processed, Khader said."
59034f787be9e02646bd32b4,"Pakistan's vulnerable, embattled shrines",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/598090/pakistans-vulnerable-embattled-shrines.html,2017-02-24,"Pakistan's vulnerable, embattled shrinesFatima Bhutto, Feb 25, 2017, International New York Times 0:10 ISTThe sufi shrines of Pakistan, sanctuaries for the poor and the weak, are being attacked by the extremistsLast Thursday, a suicide bomber affiliated with the Islamic State attacked Sehwan Sharif, one of the most revered Sufi shrines, in the southern Sindh Province of Pakistan, killing more than 80 people, including 24 children, and wounding more than 250.Why the terrorists hate Sehwan is why we love it. The saint and his shrine at Sehwan belong to everyone, to Sunnis and Shiites, to Hindus and Muslims, transgender devotees, to believers and questioners alike. The inclusiveness, the rituals and music born of syncretic roots make shrines like Sehwan Sharif targets in the extremist interpretations of the IS and other radical Wahhabi militants.As a child in the late 1980s and early 90s, I would visit the town of Sehwan with my family on our way from Karachi to Larkana, my familys hometown. After driving along bumpy roads deserted but for palm trees and solitary men standing on the open highways selling lotus flower seeds, we would stop near the western bank of the Indus River to visit the shrine of Sehwans patron saint, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, a 13th-century Persian mystic and poet who was a contemporary of Rumi.Qalandar, whose real name was Syed Mohammad Usman Marwandi, is adored in music and poetry as the Red Falcon. As you drive through the narrow, dusty streets of Sehwan, the air becomes perfumed with the scent of roses, sold in small plastic bags and body-length garlands that devotees lay at his tomb. I was seven-year-old when I first saw Sehwan during Ashura, when Shiites mourn the Prophet Muhammads grandson Hussain, who was killed in 680 by an unjust ruler at Karbala, in what is now Iraq.I remember thousands of men and women together in collective, ritualised mourning in the courtyard of Lal Shahbaz Qalandars shrine. They walked barefoot over glass and the embers of burning cigarette butts, their black shalwar kameez drenched in sweat, their palms striking their chests rhythmically. Even as a seven-year-old, I found something hypnotic, something fierce, something pure about Sehwan.Over the years, I kept returning to Sehwan to sit in that courtyard, the shrine illuminated by red and green fairy lights, its golden dome and turquoise minarets soaring above a town of modest roofs.The cool tiled floor of the shrine is often carpeted with devotees, some carrying tiffins of food on outings with their children, others in fraying and torn shalwar kameez prostrate in prayer. Even wealthy urbanites visit to lay their anxieties at the feet of the buried saint, tiptoeing gingerly through the crowds. In a country built and maintained on immovable divisions of ethnicity, gender, class and belief, the shrine at Sehwan welcomed all. It was an egalitarian oasis formed by the legacies and practice of Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism merging into one.On Thursday evenings, people congregate to listen to the religious songs called qawwali and perform a devotional dance, dhamal. They arrive with offerings of bruised rose petals, sugared almonds and what money they can spare. They seek solace from their pain; pray for safety in a harsh, unjust world; beg for an answer to a forgotten prayer. Those who cant offer anything arrive empty-handed. Sehwans shrine promised the weak, the worried and the poor that they would always be safe here.Every time we visited the shrine, a deaf and mute man named Goonga welcomed my brother, Zulfi, and me. A servant and a guardian of the shrine, Goonga wore his hair in a turban and had a matted beard. On the breast pocket of his shalwar kameez, he sometimes wore a picture of Hussain. Goonga would walk us through the shrine that was his home and refuge.In the courtyard of the shrine, men in flowing robes and long dreadlocks sing: O red-robed, protect me always, Jhule Lal, Friend of Sindh, of Sehwan, God-intoxicated Qalandar, Every breath intoxicated by you, Qalandar. No matter how far from Sehwan I have travelled, how far from lands where Urdu is spoken and heard, just to hear Dama dam mast Qalandar is to be transported home.My brother called me after the attack on the shrine. Goonga, he asked. Is he alive? We were trying to find out. But no one had seen Goonga since the blast. We Pakistanis always believed our saints protected us. In Karachi, where we live by the sea, we believe that the shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi, overlooking the Arabian Sea shore, saved the city from cyclones and tsunamis.Before Qalandar arrived here, before Islam came to the subcontinent, Sehwan was known as Shivistan after the Hindu god Shiva. In time, the towns name was changed, but Sindh has long remained a home to all faiths. At the annual festival of Qalandar, a Hindu and a Muslim family together drape a ceremonial cloth over Qalandars grave. A lamp-lighting ceremony reminiscent of Hindu rites is also performed.The shrine in Sehwan was attacked because it belongs to an open, inclusive tradition that some in Pakistan would rather forget than honour. Though it was founded as a sanctuary for Muslims, in its early incarnation, Pakistan was a home for all those who wished to claim it. Parsis, Sikhs, Christians and Jews remained in Pakistan after the bloody Partition in 1947.Brutal military dictatorGen Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, Pakistans brutal military dictator in the 1980s, aided by Saudi money and supported by the United States, destroyed Pakistans progressive, syncretic culture. In the 11 years that General Zia presided over Pakistan, our textbooks were rewritten, exclusionary, intolerant laws were passed, and primacy was given to the bearers of a closed, violent worldview. Pakistan never recovered. Only pockets of the country still imbibe the generous welcome once afforded to all faiths. Sehwan is one of them.After the attack, Pakistans military closed the border with Afghanistan and complained that the attackers had been given haven in Afghanistan. In retaliation, 100 people accused of being terrorists have been killed by the military.Sehwan has no proper hospital, no trauma centres. For all its historical, religious and cultural significance, it was  like so much of this wounded country  abandoned by those who rule the province. There is no real governance here, no justice and no order. For lifes basic necessities, people must supplicate themselves before dead saints.On the morning after the blast, the caretaker rang the bell, just as he always had. Devotees broke through the police cordons and returned to dance the dhamal on Saturday. Zulfi texted, Goonga is alive.On my last visit to the shrine, after Goonga walked me through the crowded marketplace selling food and offerings, I sat on the floor besides a mother who had brought her son, crippled with polio, in the hopes that her prayers would ease his suffering. I had come to the shrine to see the blue and white floral kashi tiles, to walk around the perimeter and to be in a part of Pakistan that still operated on that rarest of currencies: hope."

To the credit of the State, since 2010, at least 17 reserves of various categories spread over 2,110 sq. km. were declared  many of them in the oft-neglected regions in the plains of the State. In contrast, in the 20 years before that, just five reserves and sanctuaries were declared, spreading across a measly 91 sq. km.Currently, more than 10 newly declared sanctuaries and protected areas vie for nearly Rs. 20 crore (2016 revised estimates budget) allotted for the development of new sanctuaries and the fear is that this amount is getting stretched.Take for instance, the six wildlife and bird sanctuaries, community, and conservation reserves that come under the Mysuru Circle, received just Rs. 2.97 crore last year  much of it to the popular Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary that sees thousands of visitors annually  shows a response to an RTI query. For lesser-known Melkote Wildlife Sanctuary, spread across nearly 50 sq. km., barely Rs. 55 lakh was spent in 2015-16 and Rs. 7 lakh till December-end.According to the RTI replies, there are just five field officers (Range and Deputy Range officers) for the six reserves which span nearly 68 sq. km.The situation is the same for other sanctuaries, whether it is the Gudekote Sloth Bear Sanctuary in Ballari or Jayamangali Blackbuck Community Reserve in Tumakuru where just Rs. 3 lakh had been accorded, and where gram panchayats are being asked for funds to manage the water crisis. The 35-sq.km. Thimmalapura Sanctuary at Tumakuru received just around Rs. 1.5 crore, when the demand was over Rs. 5 crore.Forests are barely accorded 1% of the States budget, and the declaration of new reserves is stretching this money. But it is an ongoing process, and it will take time to realise plans for these reserves, said a forest official.Increased protectionPrincipal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) K.S. Sugara said there were enough funds for core activities. More than spending money, it is about securing and protecting the ecosystem there. Even declaring areas as wildlife sanctuaries helps a lot in controlling untoward incidents of poaching or fires, he said.This has seen with some success at the 96-sq.km. Chinkara Sanctuary at Bagalkot which was given just around Rs. 1 crore since its notification in December 2015. With this, three anti-poaching camps were set up and locals were taken into confidence to stop ritual hunting. The effect is already seen. The Chinkara population is greater than 100 now and is increasing, said M.R. Desai, Honorary Wildlife Warden, Bagalkot."

State Energy Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule at the first Janata Darbar organised by the MSEDCL on Thursday.He reached an hour late, but the minute State Energy Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule arrived at the first Janata Darbar organised by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) on Thursday, rapid instructions were belted out to local residents to restrict their grievances to just one-liners.I dont want any commentary just give your name and complaint in one brief sentence, and the officer from the respective division should be present here, Bawankule directed sternly.It was after a rapid fire two-hour interaction with consumers that Bawankule admitted that 90 per cent of the 200 complaints were indeed genuine. I have instructed officers to look into the matter and given my mobile number for consumers to personally report it if their grievances are not resolved, he said.The complaints ranged from how electricity meter readings were not accurate to the prolonged wait for a permanent connection. Among the poignant complaints was one from Jaibhai, who bitterly pointed out that he was charged Rs 150 for a copy of the consumer profile ledger, and one from a farmer who demanded compensation after his sugarcane crop was destroyed due to a short circuit from a power line that ran through his farm.Responding to these complaints, Bawankule announced that such steep charges would no longer be levied, and directed that the farmer be compensated immediately.On complaints about inaccurate electricity bills, the minister directed that on the 30th of each month, the consumer could take his own meter reading by downloading the MSEDCLs mobile app. Its that simple. Now the next complaint, he said as the queue moved ahead.The exercise also had some lighter moments, when two women involved in a family dispute took on each other at the darbar. The minister had to calm them down and tell them to keep their fight confined to their homes, and present only their complaint at the darbar. I am here to resolve that, he said.One of the consumers, Waghmare from Hadapsar, raised the issue of irregularities in the Infrastructure  phase 2 project. He complained that as per the rules, the meter connection has to be installed within a month of the application being filed. When Waghmare claimed that there were more than 100 applications pending at Talegaon and Wadgaon, the minister snapped at the officer concerned, who sheepishly responded that the MSEDCL had not received sufficient meters. How then do we supply them, asked the officer.The complaint by a retired MSEDCL official, Suryakant Kulkarni, was cut short when the minister bluntly told him to just place his demand for pension rather than beat around the bush.Chandrakant Kale from Solapur bazaar was also told to keep his family dispute aside and not ask for disruption of power supply to other members of his family. Remember, I have come here to ensure power for all, the minister said, as his whirlwind Pune tour, which began with laying the foundation stone for a 22/11 KV sub station at Bopodi and Kothrud, and inaugurating a 22/22 KV switching station at Balewadi, concluded with a darbar to hear the grievances of consumers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

He returned to his native village due to his fathers ill health and took up farming extensively.Farming is fascinating and gives solace in life. The only thing it requires is hard work and devotion, Bhat said. He has cultivated paddy, arecanut, fodder and maize on eight acres of land and is self-sufficient in his requirements.Bhat said dairy farming is essential for adopting organic farming techniques. He has reared 18 cattle in his cowshed and sells around 60 litres of milk daily. There is a good demand for the masala buttermilk prepared by him and it was an instant hit at a Krishi mela held recently.He uses a milching machine for milking the cows. With the help of two labourers, he looks after his farm land as well as cattle. The dairy unit is attached to the composting unit so that cattle dung can be easily utilised for the process without involving much labour.Even gomutra (urine of cattle) from the cowshed is made to flow into a 60,000-litre biodigester. All the organic waste from households, including leaves, are also dumped into the biodigester. The slurry from the unit is pumped to the farm land as manure. On an average, 600 litres of cow urine enters the biodigester everyday.Cow dung from the cattle shed enters three cubic metre-capacity biogas unit tank. As the dung is put into the unit two times in a day, gobar gas is available for the family round-the-clock for cooking.Bhat has also placed mats on the floor of the cowshed to maintain hygiene. Organic manure has increased the fertility of the soil. He sells 25 to 30 tonnes of vermi compost and cow dung manure.Even the fodder required for cattle is cultivated on his two acre land. Five different kinds of grass, including sugar grass and Rhodes, are cultivated on two acres of land. As a result, the cattle never face shortage of fodder. The grass is also cut using machines, he added.Bhat has also dug a huge pond for percolation of rain water. As a result, water is available in the pond round-the-year and is sufficient to irrigate his farm land.Bhat said, Organic farming has increased the fertility of the soil. Cow urine, cow dung and other organic materials from households are also used for manure.Organic farming is not just a system of farming. It is good for environment and surroundings. It is not only eco-friendly, but also more economical for farmers to raise cattle in an integrated farm. Bhat is also the president of Subhiksha Savayava Krishika Sangha."

As a result, thousands of acres of farmlands in Srirangapatna and Ganjam are bereft of agricultural activities.The Virija and Chikkadevarajasagar (CDS) canals of Chikkadevaraja Wadiyar period (1673 to 1704) too have gone dry. The situation is similar at Visvesvaraya, Rajaparameshwari, Ramaswamy and other canals.Crop lossFarmers are facing the worst drought and many of them are selling their cattle for a throw away price as they cannot provide fodder and water. The farmers are in a fix as coconut trees in the low-lying areas of KRS, which were giving good yield since 20 to 25 years have dried up. They had pinned hopes on pre-monsoon rains during Ugadi, but that too disappointed them.Narasimhegowda, 75, a resident of Ganjam, said that he has never seen Bangaradoddi Canal go dry. As the canal is around the ridges of the river, water flows into the canal on all 365 days in a year. Coconut, banana, sugarcane, paddy, ragi and other crops were grown in the region. Now, there is no drinking water for even livestock, he said.Crop loss is reported on 1,005 hectares of land due to the failure of pre-monsoon rain. The farmers have suffered crop loss, due to failure of post-monsoon rain, on 2,555 hectares. Ragi, horsegram and alasande (black-eyed peas) crops have been lost.The people of Bastipura and other villages are also facing an acute shortage of water. Residents say that these villages are located near the KRS dam but in spite of the area going dry, water is being supplied once a week through tankers to Mahadevapura village which is situated on the banks of the river."

It is alleged that around 150 acres of the lake has been encroached upon. The remaining 700 acres lake irrigates more than 5,000 acres of land, nearby.The lake, which would usually remain filled throughout the year, has gone totally dry this year, affecting the environment. The animals, birds and other aquatic creatures have been affected. Sugar cane, paddy and banana crops that were dependent on the lake have withered, landing the farmers in trouble.Take up repair worksThe lake has two canals, Kemmannunale and Chamanahallinale. The sluice of Kemmannunale has collapsed and cannot be operated. The authorities have to use earthmovers to lift and close the sluice gates every time to release water. The sluice gate of the Chamanahalli Canal too is in a dilapidated condition. As the lake is empty, it is the right time for the Cauvery Neeravari Nigam authorities to take up repair work on both the canals, say people of the region.Speaking to DH, Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Assistant Engineer Tara said, A survey has already been conducted to desilt the lake. If around two to three feet of silt is removed in a scientific manner, there is a possibility to store more water in the lake. The works would begin soon.However, the farmers said MLA D C Thammanna should take measures to clear the encroachment of the lake and for its rejuvenation. He should exert pressure on the government to release more funds for rejuvenating the lake, which should be done before the onset of monsoon, they stressed."

The SP has this time promised laptops to meritorious students and smart phones for all.BJP and Congress, which is fighting the polls in alliance with SP, besides parties like Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) have all promised free wi-fi internet services in all colleges and universities, apparently to cash in on the 'Digital India' wave.Like in the past, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), however, has stayed clear of coming out with a manifesto this elections, with its supremo Mayawati stressing that her party does not believe in making promises but ""acting"" on them.Congress has promised to provide free school education for every girl child and give free bicycles to girl students from Class IX to XII. BJP, on the other hand, has announced free school education to all students and extending it till graduation for the meritorious ones.Notably, to instill a technical approach and scientific attitude among the students who passed class XII the state government had launched a scheme to provide a laptop to them.In 2012-13 and 2013-14 fiscal years, Rs 3,43,009.91 crore were spent and 14,82,093 students covered in the scheme. In 2016-17, it was proposed to cover 39,600 students, according to an official UP government data on planning.With nearly 20 crore people, Uttar Pradesh remains a populous state. It sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha and it has a 403-member Assembly. The state, however, does not fare well in important sectors like education, health, industry, and agriculture engages over 70 per cent of its people.BSP has announced waiving farm loans of up to Rs 1 lakh, while BJP, Congress, SP and RLD have made a similar promise albeit without announcing any such upper limits.In a bid to woo farmers, parties including BJP and SP have promised round-the-clock power supply while Congress raised a similar pitch with its slogan ""karza maaf, bijli half"" (loan waiver and 50 per cent reduction in power bills).The BJP, in its manifesto called 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra', has also promised lower rates of interest on loans to farmers, an assurance which the SP has retained from its 2012 manifesto.SP has promised to raise crop insurance scheme to Rs 7.5 lakh from present Rs 5 lakh, while also setting up a Treasury for Farmers.The issue of pending payments to sugarcane farmers in the state, particularly in western parts, has been simmering for quite some time now with parties highlighting it in their poll documents.BJP has promised clearing all such dues within 120 days of coming to power, while RLD has assured ensuring full payments in just two weeks' time.Almost all the parties invariably have promised modernisation of the mandis and have given assurances of connecting them with technology to ensure fair price to the farmers for their yield and facilitate its sale.Congress listed its thrust areas to boost infrastructure and promised to ensure food security by providing wheat and rice at Rs 3 and Rs 2 a kg, giving nutritious meal in Mid Day Meal scheme and revamping Public Distribution System.BJP said that on lines of the central government's decision, no interview will be held for Class III and Class IV UP government jobs to end corruption in recruitment if it comes to power.BSP said if it gets back to power, quota facility will continue besides reservation will also be extended to the poor among the upper castes, based on their financial condition, even as SP, which promised extra reservation to Muslims in 2012, stayed mum on the matter this time.Mayawati, who has alleged politics of vendetta, said minorities and Dalits were framed and sent to jail during the SP rule while promising that these cases will be reviewed and those found innocent will be freed, as she eyed her traditional vote bank.The Congress manifesto vowed to appoint a police ombudsman to handle cases of police oppression and set up a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to ensure relief for victims of criminal oppression."

However, the government should start giving unpolished rice (brown rice) which is enriched with protiens, fibre and minerals instead of the less nutritious white rice.He said this delivering a talk on Food Security and Safety, organised as part of World Consumers Day at Tumkur University campus on Friday.Food security is all about people having access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food available locally to meet their dietary needs for leading a healthy life. The food preferences differe from region to region. In Mangaluru, people prefer boiled rice while it is ragi in old mysuru region and jowar in north Karnataka districts, the food expert explained.It is not right to distribute white rice in all regions. The white rice lacks fibre and nutritional value, he said.The rice mill owners are willing to supply unpolished rice. By doing so they can save Rs 500 spent on polishing the rice. The rice mill owners have told me that they would supply brown rice or unpolished rice If the government issues order in this regard, Bengaluru-based food expert said. He added that even the government is planning to procure the unpolished rice and if it goes ahead with its plan, it would do a world of good to the poor and underprivileged families.Sugar, new nicotineThe food expert explened to the gathering about the ill-effects of sugar. He said, 25 grams of sugar a day is enough for a person. But the people consume far more than the recommended levels and become vulnerable to many diseases. These days the food scientists call sugar new nicotine.It is wrong to process Maida out of wheat. But they do convert wheat into Maida and use as many as 12 chemicals to make it fine and white. The consumption of which will lead to many diseases. Never fall for colour and taste when it comes to food, he advised.Food and Civil Supplies Deputy Director Manteswamy called upon the people that if they find any lapses or shortcomings in the food items, they should bring it to the notice of district consumer centre.Vice Chancellor Dr A H Rajasab said that the country can achieve food security only when the foodgrains production was based on the population. ""Before Independence, the population of India was 33 crore while it is 130 crore now. However, the extent of land used for cultivation has come down considerably, the VC said.Registrar M Venkateshwaralu, district consumer information centre convener T S Niranjan and others were present."

When the then chief minister D Devaraj Urs quit the Congress to found the Kranthi Ranga, Prasad was the president of undivided Mysuru district unit of the Ranga, while Shankar was heading its Chikkamagaluru unit. However, it was in the later days, that they developed a bond and remained close friends. Whenever Prasad came to Chikkamagaluru, he was a regular to Shankars house.On Monday too, Prasad was travelling near Hiremagalur around 8.30 pm, when he called Shankar on the latters cell phone. Shankar, who had gone for coffee pulp, returned home asking his wife Uma to prepare dinner.Prasad and his entourage, that included his friends, personal assistants and gunman, were treated to sumptuous food that included dishes like chicken, mutton, rice rotti, kadubu and also idli. Prasad, who also took curd rice and a peg of whiskey, told Shankar, I cannot stop eating curd rice despite the cold weather.When Shankar insisted on Prasad staying overnight, Prasad refused with a heavy heart saying, I too dont want to miss the early morning coffee. However, he promised to visit them again during his next visit to the district, recalled Shankar, who was trying to hold back his tears.Had invited leadersChikkamagaluru District Congress Committee president Dr D L Vijaykumar, who recalled his conversation with the minister over phone, said, The minister called during night hours, inviting the party leaders to join him for breakfast in the resort at 8.30 am.Likewise, I, along with chairman of Jungle Lodges and Resorts A N Mahesh couple, leaders T D Rajegowda and M C Shivananda Swamy went to the resort and waited for him. As the minister did not come out of the cottage he was staying in, we suspected something fishy. The staff was asked to open the door, only to see him dead.Close palsPrasads close pals, film producer Y N Shankare Gowda of Ishta Kamya fame, who is also the director of Karnataka State Marketing Federation, and former president of Gundlupet Town Municipal Council Najeemuddin, had accompanied their friend from Mysuru to Chikkamagaluru and were staying in the opposite room. They were dumbstruck on hearing the news.They said they regularly travelled with the minister whenever he went on tours to other districts. However, he never missed his morning stroll. It was only after returning from his morning walk did the minister wake them up.When their friend did not turn up, Shankare Gowda and Najeemuddin thought that he may have gone to bath after returning from walk. As the clock ticked, they turned anxious and tried to reach him over phone, but in vain. They knocked on the door of his cottage, but there was no response. They later peeped through the window, to see him sleeping. It was then that they summoned the resort staff to open the door.Complained of fatigueAccording to them, the minister had complained of fatigue due to his busy schedule as he had attended three programmes in the day. He had also complained of eating much at the food festival during the ongoing scouts jamboree at Adakanahally near Nanjangud in Mysuru district.Vision for MM HillsRecalling their friends vision for developing Male Mahadeshwara Hill shrine, the duo said, A site to set up an information centre had also been identified in Mysuru.

At present, India is producing 710 million tonnes of food, including 270 million tonnes of grains and 270 million tonnes of vegetables. So, the average per capita availability of food is 400 grams. By 2030, the population of India is expected to go up to 160 crore. Then, it will be a challenge to feed the nation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is speaking about doubling the income of farmers, which also means doubling the production. If farmers stick to traditional farming practices, no targets can be reached, he said.Shivanna said, following research, the yield of paddy, which was 10 to 15 quintals per acre, has reached up to 60 quintals. The yield of sugarcane, which was 30 to 40 tonnes, has now reached 100 tonnes per acre. Research is underway to make the yield 220 tonnes of sugarcane per acre. But, farmers should adopt the technologies and practices offered by the scientists.Steps should be taken by the farmers to minimise the use of water because water is a precious resource. The system of supplying water to the fields through canals should also be changed. In canals, while 30% of the water gets percolated into the ground, 30% gets evaporated. With nearly 10% of other wastage, only 30% of the water is available for agriculture, he pointed out.He lamented over the abandoning of agriculture by farmers. Even though 160 million hectares of land is deemed to be under cultivation in India, nearly 26 million hectares of land has gone barren due to various reasons. So, the challenge to feed the nation is really tough, he said.Wadiyars contributionRecounting the concern for farmers and the farsight of the Wadiyars, he said, maharani Kempa Nanjammani, popularly addressed as Vani Vilasa Sannidhana, the then regent for her son maharaja Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, granted 30 acres of land at Hebbal in Bengaluru in 1898 for the establishment of an agriculture centre. It started functioning in 1906 under the reign of Nalvadi.In 1917, when agriculture was at crossroads, Nalvadi invited Leslie C Coleman, a scientist at the Hebbal centre, to establish a research centre near Mysuru, to rescue the farmers from the dire straits. The works on the KRS dam across the River Cauvery was underway and a plot near Naganahalli and Belakavadi were chosen. Ultimately, Naganahalli was finalised. After the completion of the KRS dam, Coleman was also entrusted with the responsibility of establishing the Research Centre near Mallanayakana Katte, which is popular as VC (Visvesvaraya Canal) Farm in Mandya district at present, he said.Agriculture Commissioner G Sathish, UAS Academic Director D P Kumar, Researcher Director N R Gangadharappa, Extension Director K Jagadishwar, Dean (PG) N Krishnamurthy, Dean (Agri) T Shivashankar, Joint Director for Agriculture K M Somasundar, Naganahalli centre Senior Field Superintendent C Govindaraju and Associate Research Director C R Ravishankar were present."

There is drought like situation in 160 taluks of the state. Inspite of appealing to the Centre, only Rs 450 crore has been released so far. Whether the exchequer of the Centre is also empty, he questioned.He said both the Centre and the state governments have failed to listen to the problems of coffee, sugarcane and paddy growers. The minimum support price announced by the government is less than that of market price, he claimed.Kumaraswamy said Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and the chief secretary should consider the issue of Karnataka High Courts circular that ministers and MLAs cannot share dias with judges and the chief justice seriously and solve the row.He called upon the Vokkaliga community members, who are called by different names, to unite for the welfare of members.He was speaking at a Guruvandane programme organised by Vokkaligara Kshemabhivruddhi Sangha at Kothooru in Virajpet taluk on Saturday.There are four lakh members in Halakki community, who are deprived of educational facilites. The society can develop when all the community members are taken on the path of progress, he added.Adichunchanagiri Mutt seer Nirmalanandanatha Swami said the mutts should help in the development of the country.

Not, just politically, he is also affected personally.Immediately after the reshuffling on June 19, Siddaramaiah had to face the outburst of Srinivas Prasad. The latter subsequently quit Congress and joined BJP on January 02, blaming the chief minister. The by-election for the Nanjangud Assembly constituency, earlier held by Prasad, is expected to be held in February.Meanwhile, Rakesh Siddaramaiah, son of Siddaramaiah, who was seen as the heir apparent of the chief minister died on July 30, during his visit to the Tomorrowland festival in Belgium. Siddaramaiahs second son Dr Yatindra is being groomed in politics, without much results. It is anticipated that Siddaramaiah would return to his old constituency of Chamundeshwari, leaving the present constituency of Varuna to his son Dr Yatindra in the next Assembly polls.K Marigowda, a close confidant of the chief minister and also an aspirant for Congress ticket from the Chamundeshwari constituency, went absconding on July 3, after he was accused of intimidating the then Deputy Commissioner C Shikha. Now, he is out on bail. If Dr Yatindra does not keep up to the expectations of his father to contest from Varuna, K Marigowda will be happy to claim Chamundeshwari.The chief ministers plan for a truck with JD(S) in the Mysuru mayors election failed on December 8. The JD(S)-BJP combine, which is in power in most of the local bodies, including the zilla panchayat, continued the alliance. So, the hopes of the chief minister to make the Congress the ruling party in at least one of the local bodies, failed in his home district.Following the demonetisation of high-denomination currency notes, officers such as Chikkarayappa and S C Jayachandra, deemed to be the confidantes of the chief minister and Dr H C Mahadevappa respectively, were arrested following IT raids. They are now under the scrutiny of the Enforcement Directorate. Dr Mahadevappas son Sunil Bose, who is an accused in an old bribery case related to sand extraction, is on bail. Bose is suspected to be in the list of those involved in hoarding cash, as revealed by the two officers.Now, with the demise of Cooperation and Sugar Minister H S Mahadev Prasad, who held the Gundlupet Assembly constituency continously since 1994 on various party symbols, a by-election has become inevitable. Prasad and Dr H C Mahadevappa were seen as close to the chief minister.Prasad was the only Lingayat MLA of the old Mysuru region from the Congress. His son H M Ganesh Prasad, an industrialist, who is also active in politics, would have to be fielded by the Congress in the by-election. But, since the past two elections, C S Niranjan Kumar has been giving tough fight to Mahadev Prasad. In the 2013 election, while Mahadev Prasad had secured 73,723 votes, Niranjan Kumar, on a KJP ticket, had secured 66,048 votes.In 2008, when Kumar had contested on a BJP ticket, the margin of Prasads victory was 2,203. While Prasad had polled 64,824 votes, Kumar had garnered 62,621 votes."

However, the number of suicides in 2016-17 (up to February) is less, compared to last year. While 123 farmers had committed suicide in 2015-16 (highest in the state), 51 farmers have ended their lives so far, this year with 10 farmers killing selves in February alone.Out of 123 deaths, 32 cases were considered ineligible for compensation. In the remaining 91 cases, compensation of Rs 5 lakh was paid to the family of the farmers who committed suicide.The state government has paid a total of Rs 4.55 crore as compensation. In 2016-17, out of 51 cases, only one has been rejected and Rs 1.65 crore compensation has been paid to 33 families, while documents are under being scrutinised in respect of remaining 17 cases. Mounting debts are said to be the reason behind the suicide cases.The water level in KRS dam, the lifeline of the district, did not cross 110 feet mark in 2016, while the maximum level is 124 ft. The present water level is 78.42 ft (5.71 tmc ft water storage). The farmers in the Cauvery basin suffered crop loss on 70,000 hectares and the loss is estimated to be Rs 110 crore.The situation will ease only if the district receives sufficient rains in 2017 monsoon, as the farmers can take up paddy cultivation, which will yield them some profits by October.The situation is worse for sugar cane growers. If they transplant cane in July 2017, they can harvest the crop only by August 2018.MLA K S Puttannaiah said that in the last 13 years, the district had faced the worst drought for nine years. The farmers are reeling under the debt trap. The government should bail out the farmers by waiving farm loans and by advancing new loans, he added."

The anti-Ambareesh camp of the party has been orphaned while M H Ambareesh himself has been rendered irrelevant with his dropping from the state Cabinet in June last. It is an advantage for the Janata Dal (Secular), which is already strong in the district. So, the Congress badly needs a leader in Mandya district.Krishnas entry into electoral politics in 1962 was with a bang. He defeated the then state Congress president H K Veeranna Gowda, who was projected as the chief ministerial candidate Now, after enjoying plum posts for over five decades 55 years, his exit from the Congress has stirred the hornets nest.Krishna has indirectly ridiculed Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Most of the old Congressmen in Siddaramaiahs Cabinet, including KPCC president Dr G Parameshwara and Energy Minister D K Shivakumar, were his followers. Hence, the future of many leaders, who looked up to him for guidance, especially in Mandya district, is now in doldrums.In Mandya district, out of seven Assembly constituencies, Congress holds just two - Mandya and Malavalli while the JD(S) has Srirangapatna, KR Pet, Maddur and Nagamangala constituencies in its kitty. Melkote constituency is represented by K S Puttannaiah of Karnataka Sarvodaya Party (KSP). C S Puttaraju of JD(S) is the MP of Mandya, which also includes K R Nagar taluk of Mysuru. All three MLCs from Mandya district - Appajigowda of the JD(S), Marithibbegowda and K T Srikantegowda - are also JD(S) nominees.It was said that Ambareesh, who represents Mandya Assembly constituency, wanted all the MLAs in the district to be from the JD(S), where he has several personal friends, as he wanted to be a minister from the district without any competition. It is a well-known fact that Ambareesh is very close to D C Thammanna of Maddur, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda of Srirangapatna and C S Puttaraju of Melkote.As the Congress workers in Melkote supported K S Puttanaiah of the KSP instead of the scapegoat, L D Ravi, Puttaraju was defeated. However, he was successful in fielding an ineffective S L Lingaraju in Srirangapatna from the Congress, which resulted in the rebellion of Ravindra Srikantaiah, who contested as an Independent. In Maddur, G M Madhu, ex-MP G Madegowdas son, a Congress nominee, was neglected by party workers at the behest of Ambareesh. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls also, it is suspected that Ambareesh played a major role in the election of his confidante Puttaraju of the JD(S) against actor Ramya, who had sought re-election on a Congress ticket.After becoming minister, the power was concentrated in the hands of one Chandrasekhar, a hotelier. All other party leaders and workers were neglected in the district. As of now, Ambareesh seems to have forgotten Mandya and the voters have forgotten him. However, his victory in the next Assembly election cannot be ruled out, given his charisma as an actor, a Rebel Star.Thus, the Congress leaders and workers, except Ambareesh, Chandrasekhar and their supporters, united using the name of Krishna, as a shield against Ambareesh. Interestingly, most of them, including former minister M S Atmananda, were earlier identified in the Madegowda faction, when Krishna held power. Since the 1960s, Madegowda was deemed as the bete noire of Krishna, even though they were in the Congress and belonged to the same taluk - Maddur.Now, the anti-Ambareesh faction has become helpless. So, there is a scope for the emergence of a leader who can fill confidence among members of both the factions and lead the Congress. However, there is no such leader in sight, at least for now. While Ravindra Srikantaiah, a KPCC member, who shot to fame by opposing Ambareesh in the 2013 Assembly polls, immediately announced his decision to follow Krishna, ex-MLC D Madegowda in Mysuru also announced his resignation to the Congress. Many more office-bearers of the party in both Mandya and Mysuru district have resigned."

It is in the kitchen that financial status of the family is reflected, observed Sen.Kitchen activities intrudes into the privacy of thoughts as women spend their time thinking and planning for tomorrow, which is the similar to bottomless well. Kitchen has been a subject for several poets, Sen said.Renowned theaterperson Arundhathi Nag said kitchen literature has enormous metamorphic meanings. Exploring her past, she said kitchen was her only refute and a place for meditation in the darkest moments of her life. She said kitchen is the area where life nurtured her and enabled her to encounter many tribulations.Manipal University pro chancellor Dr H S Ballal said the sustenance of culture and art legacy is essential for the future generation. By 2020, the girls should be brought into the mainstream of the society. Although the concept of kitchen has changed these days, the girls should be educated and empowered, he said.Music with kitchenwareSukanya Ramgopal, the country's first woman ghatam player presented a music concert along with her four disciples including woman potter Sumana Chandrasekhar.Kitchenware, such as earthen pots, glasses, pans, salt and sugar tins, small-sized wet grinder, wooden churner, stone pot, lagan, an Indian utensil common in Muslim households, a colander, Mora, spoons, plates and bottles, were used to produce music.

(Pradip Das)What was supposed to be the last day for Indian citizens who were abroad during November-December 2016 to deposit their denotified currency notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500, instead saw a large turnout of people from within the country who missed the December 30 deadline for exchange of demonetised notes due to various reasons.One of them was Mohammed Nabeel Ansari, a construction labourer in Goa, who met with an accident a week after the government announced demonetisation. Ansari underwent a leg surgery and was immobile for almost two months. In January, when Ansari went home to Sitamarhi in Bihar, his wife handed him old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 worth Rs 17,000.I took it to Goa immediately, but the bank asked me to go to RBI in Mumbai. I came here and since then. I have been coming everyday to this place in the hope that they will exchange my old notes. But they havent. I have all my medical records and reports to prove my claim, said Ansari.In another case, Sindhubai Jhadav, a widow from Dhule who came to exchange Rs 35,000 in scrapped notes, was turned down by the RBI Friday. Jhadav, a farmer, said she found Rs 35,000 in old notes in the belongings of her mother-in-law who passed away earlier this month.What do I do, she (mother-in-law) never told us about it. I found the money while emptying her room. Now I have taken a loan of Rs 5,000 to come to Mumbai, but the RBI is not accepting my money, said Jhadav.Apart from Jhadav, a bottled water delivery man, Kanhabhai, travelled 800 km in a bus from a village close to Gondal in Gujarat to reach the RBI office at 7 am, along with his uncle to deposit about Rs 65,000 held by his 80-year-old ailing mother.They (RBI) say only people who were outside the country can deposit money. I dont know what to do. After demonetisation, I kept on asking my mother if she had old notes, and she said no. Last week, I found this money in her trunk. I am ruined, said Kanhabhai.On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai was visited by hundreds of ineligible citizens, hoping to exchange their old notes. (Pradip Das) On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai was visited by hundreds of ineligible citizens, hoping to exchange their old notes. (Pradip Das)On November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while announcing the demonetisation move, had said citizens unable to deposit their old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 by December 30, 2016 could do so at specified RBI offices up to March 31, 2017.After the deadline to exchange the scrapped notes expired on December 30, 2016, the government issued an ordinance saying only those who were abroad, Armed Forces personnel posted in remote areas, or others who could give valid reasons for not being able to deposit the cancelled notes could do so till March 31.On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) headquarters in Mumbai was visited by hundreds of ineligible citizens such as Ansari and Jhadav, in the hope that the government would give them another chance to submit their scrapped notes.While most of the people who were abroad during November-December 2016 quietly queued outside the central bank waiting for their turn, around 11 oclock in the morning, the crowd of ineligible people that had gathered outside the RBI as early as 7 am became so unmanageable that police were called in to control the crowd.The anger and frustration of the people was palpable as they started shouting slogans against the government and the RBI.We are the ones who vote, not the NRIs (Non-Resident Indians). Then why are they getting special treatment? Narendra Modi says he is a chai wala, but doesnt understand what poor people are going through. Mann ki baat karo ya dil ki baat karo, PM bas ek baar aake iss line main khade raho ek ghante. (Whether or not he holds heart-to-heart talks with us, the PM should just come stand in this queue for an hour), said Laxman Khare, a sugarcane farmer from Bidar in Karnataka, who was turned down by the RBI.According to a finance ministry statement, the note exchange facility would now be available only for citizens of India who are not residents of India, till June 30, 2017. This exchange facility will be subject to Foreign Exchange Management (Export and Import of Currency) Regulations, 2015. These rules restrict bringing back Indian currency into the country to Rs 25,000 per person.khushboo.narayan@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590387a97be9e0264d1d12f9,Government approves unrestricted exports of organic agri products,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/government-approves-unrestricted-exports-of-organic-agri-products-4594365/,2017-03-31,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (File Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (File Photo)The government today allowed unrestricted exports of all certified organic agricultural products, a move that would help in boosting shipments. The decision in this regard was taken in the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The CCEA has given its approval for removal of all quantitative ceilings on individual organic products and allowed unrestricted exports of all organic agricultural and organic processed products irrespective of any existing or future restriction/prohibition on the export of their basic product (non-organic).However, the government said in view of acute shortage in the country, the quantitative ceiling on shipments of organic pulses and lentils will continue. But the ceiling was enhanced from 10,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes. The move will also result in increased adoption of organic agriculture by farmers.Removal of quantitative celling on wheat, sugar, non-basmati rice, organic sugar and increasing the limit on export of organic pulses is expected to contribute to the Governments objective of doubling the farmers income, an official statement said.It will lead to reduction in input costs in farming and gaining premium price for organic agriculture products and in the process resulting in increased adoption of organic agriculture by farmers.All organic products exports are certified by Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP).It said the government is supporting the farmers and exporters to tap huge opportunity that exists within the country and abroad for organic agriculture products.A stable and consistent export policy relating to export of organic products would allow exporters to make long term commitment to the buyers and also establish linkages with the farmers.This is likely to result in enhanced realisation to farmers from organic production, it said adding a stable export policy on organic agriculture products would complement various government programmes like National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana,Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern Region which have been taken up to encourage organic agriculture. According to estimates, the global organic market has touched USD 80 billion in 2014 and it is expected to reach USD 100 billion by 2020.Huge export potential exist in countries including the US, Europe and Canada. Indias export of organic goods have increased from USD 12.4 million in 2002-03 to USD 298 million in 2015-16.India mainly exports organic wheat, non-basmati rice and sugar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

He said that adoption of the new scheme is not mandatory for all departments.With the introduction of the new scheme more number of departments will be able to create a hassle-free academic environment. The salient features of the scheme include academic freedom for departments in running master degree programmes in terms of teaching, learning and assessment of learners and also have different regulations for PG courses run in the departments from generalised regulations, which are now applicable to master degree programmes run in affiliated colleges. The process of assessing a learner continuously shall fully be the responsibility of faculty members who offer the course in the department.The formative assessment will have three continuous components. Each assessment component should not be merely test-dominant but should be based on problem-solving, practicals, mini project work, case study, discussions, assignment and seminars. The performance of the learner in each component of 20% should be made known to the learner once in every 35-40 days.The requirement for additional non-teaching staff and administrative staff for creating hassle-free academic environment in the department should be marginal. The parent departments in Manasagangotri campus should be able to take the decision regarding inclusion of their respective satellite departments in satellite campuses into this scheme or to defer them from inclusion till they acquire suitable infrastructure.The overall ledger per candidate after the successful completion of stipulated credits will be sent to the office of the Registrar (Evaluation) for issue of consolidated transcript. At present, departments such as Biotechnology, Physics, Genetics and Genomics, Computer Application (MCA), English, Bio-chemistry, Statistics, Organic Chemistry, Chemistry, School of Foreign Languages, Sugar Technology department and Mathematics have come forward to adopt the new scheme."
