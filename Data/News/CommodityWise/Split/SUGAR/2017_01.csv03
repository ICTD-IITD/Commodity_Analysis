(Source: Instagram) Maria Sharapova was initially barred for two years after testing positive for meldonium. (Source: Instagram)Tennis star Maria Sharapova said on Tuesday she is excited about her return to competition next month, feeling vindicated by the reduction of her doping suspension and empowered by her time away.Russias former world number one was initially barred for two years after testing positive at the 2016 Australian Open for meldonium, a medication she had been taking for 10 years within the rules, but that was reclassified as a banned drug.Sharapova vigorously fought to overturn the ban, saying she had not been properly advised of the official change, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport cut the ban to 15 months and said in its ruling it did not believe she was an intentional doper.Although Im at a stage or age in my career where youre closer to the end than your beginning, you always want to end a chapter in your life on your own terms, in your own voice, Sharapova told the ANA Inspiring Women in Sports conference at Mission Hills.Thats why I fought so hard for the truth to be out, the five-times grand slam winner said at the program that included tennis and womens sports pioneer Billie Jean King, Olympic champion gymnast Aly Raisman and 2014 ANA Inspiration champion golfer Lexi Thompson.Sharapovas ban will end two days after the Stuttgart grand prix starts on April 24. She has been given a wild card by organisers, who scheduled her first match on the Wednesday in her competitive return.Some players have bristled at what they feel is preferential treatment for draw card Sharapova, who reigned as the highest earning female athlete in the world for 11 years in a row, according to Forbes.For me its not OK and I spoke to some other players and nobody is OK with it, but its not up to us, world number four Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia told reporters.Its not about her, but everyone who was doping should start from zero.Sharapova said she does not worry about the reception she will receive and is confident in her integrity.When you love what you do, and do it with passion and integrity and you work hard, and you work on court number 28 when no one is watching  then you know what you stand for and you know who you are.When Im out on court 28 and theres no one watching, thats when a lot of my trophies are being won, she said.Sharapova, who turns 30 on April 19, kept herself busy during her tennis absence.She took a class at Harvard Business School in global strategic management, spent another 10 days in London studying leadership, interned at an advertising agency, spent a week shadowing NBA commissioner Adam Silver, and a week with Nike designers besides attending to her Sugarpova candy brand.I learned that life can be OK without tennis, said Sharapova, who also just finished an autobiography scheduled to be published in September. It was empowering.Yet Sharapova is eager to get back on the court.Ive been training quite hard for the past four months, she said, adding it would likely take some time to pay off. Practice is never the same as match play.(But) I know that my mind and my body still have the motivation to be the best tennis player I can be.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"
5903a9567be9e0266aead6ba,Farmers script a new story at Onattukara,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/farmers-script-a-new-story-at-onattukara/article17470438.ece,2017-03-16,"Despite limited resources and mounting debts, many farmers at Onattukara have decided to return to the very parched land that brought them misery.A group of farmers in Palamel panchayat have taken up farming of pulses in paddy fields hit by drought, considered one of the worst faced by Kerala in more than a century. Seeds of black gram, green gram, and cowpea were sown in 30 hectares at the Payyanalloore and Pallickal padasekharams earlier this week.The paddy fields, known as Virippu and Mundakan padams, belong to the midland areas of Onattukara, a fertile region of central Kerala, where farmers follow a peculiar pattern of farming different from that of low-lying puncha fields of Kuttanad. The area has a tradition of raising multiple crops such as sesame, pulses, and sugarcane, but the practice had waned owing to poor support to farming over the years.Around 50 farmers have come together to take up farming of pulses with the help of the Krishi Bhavan and the local panchayat. Paddy farms at Onattukara depend on irrigation in the absence of rain.This year, irrigation through canals was grossly inadequate. Lack of rain added to the woes of farmers who had to abandon the crop. Investment worth thousands of rupees had gone in vain, Omana Vijayan, Palamel panchayat president, told The Hindu .The next paddy crop season will begin in September. Pulses, which do not need much water, are being raised as an interim crop, says Krishi Officer Siji Susan George. Cultivation of pulses will make sense as 2016 has been celebrated as International Year of Pulses, she adds.The Krishi Bhavan has helped the farmers in setting up a marketing facility. We have weekly markets on Tuesdays and Fridays. About 150 weekly markets have already been organised since it began during the Onam season in 2015. An eco-shop for sale of organic produce is also doing well, she says.The panchayat has agreed to extend support to the farming of pulses to help farmers recoup the money lost in paddy cultivation. A fund of Rs. 3.75 lakh has been set apart for farm initiatives, a portion of which could be utilised for the pulses project. The panchayat has readied two large ponds in the area and arrangements are being made to pump water to irrigate the crop."

They are not prepared to burn their fingers and have started switching over to fodder cultivation. A huge volume of weeds had grown in their fields and they have started preparing the grounds for the alternate cultivation particularly fodder.Arockiasamy, one of the farmers of Pullampadi who owns a tractor, says that he has started ploughing the fields for raising the fodder for animals. With the failure of monsoon, there has been a scramble for fodder in this area and hence the decision to raise the Co-5 or other fodder.He said it was high time that the ground was readied for raising the fodder. Otherwise any thick growth of weeds will involve a huge expenditure on agricultural labour, he clarified.According to sources, the entire stretch between Lalgudi and Pullampadi accounts for about 200 acres all under paddy crop. Farmers would be left with no option but to raise the fodder particularly Co-5 and other grass varieties. Sources told The Hindu that there would be a severe scarcity for hay this year as paddy had failed.About 500 acres was covered under direct sowing of paddy in Vellanur area which had totally withered away due to paucity of irrigation water. Here too, farmers were seen resorting to alternative crop of fodder.There would be a good demand for fodder and hence, a large number of farmers had started raising the fodder crop now. Moderate showers realised last week had facilitated the farmers to plough the fields.Sources said that being a risk-free cultivation, farmers had been resorting to raising fodder. It can be harvested periodically. In case of summer showers, the farmers would be blessed with adequate profit, the source added."

Sathasivam has emphasised the need for formulating agriculture policies on the basis of ground realities and by understanding the hardships of the farming community.At an interaction with award-winning farmers at Raj Bhavan here on Friday, Mr. Sathasivam said farming was a tough profession and decision-making on such matters should not be done solely by relying upon reference books and statistics.The Governor felicitated 17 farmers and farming groups who had won the Plant Genome Saviour Awards, instituted by the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Right Authority, India, during the 2007-2016 period.Crops presentedThe farmers presented the Governor with various crops, the conservation for which they were selected for the awards.Expressing pride in calling himself a farmer, Mr. Sathasivam said that he had chosen his hometown, Kadappanallur village in Erode district, Tamil Nadu, over New Delhi or Chennai to spend his post-retirement phase after having served as the Chief Justice of India.I have been actively involved in farming since my early days as a lawyer. We continue to undertake coconut, sugar cane, and paddy cultivation in our holdings of 21 acres on the banks of the Cauvery river. My younger brother has been involved in organic farming for long.Farming continues to be an essential part of our lives, he said.Kerala Agricultural University Vice Chancellor P.

Several of them had committed suicide as they were unable to repay the loans that they availed from banks and private money lenders. Farmers had suffered extensive loss due to total failure of paddy, sugarcane, banana and rain fed crops. Hence, the Centre should take steps to waive entire loans availed by farmers from nationalised banks.Mr. Sivasuriyan said that the crops could have been saved if the Karnataka released the share of Tamil Nadu as per the tribunal award.However, Karnataka government had failed to respect the award. Formation of Cauvery Water Management Board was the way out to implement the tribunal award. Hence, the Centre should constitute Cauvery Management Board and the Cauvery River Regulation Authority.Goundampatti R. Subramanian, deputy secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, said that the State had not faced such a worst drought in its recent history. Several parts of the State had already been witnessing drinking water shortage.It might face severe crisis in summer. Besides duly compensating the farmers for the crop loss, the Centre should fully accept the demand of compensation package submitted by the State government.Puliyur Nagarajan, president of TMC farmers wing, said that at least Rs. .25 lakh should be given as compensation to the farmers, who had committed suicide. Thousands of farm labourers had lost jobs during the last season due to monsoon faillure. A sum of Rs. 15,000 should be paid to each farm labourer as compensation.P. Viswanathan, president, Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Viyasayigal Sangam, said the Centre should not delay in releasing the drought mitigation fund to the State government in order to compensate the farmers for crop loss and solving drinking water problems."
5903add57be9e0266aead99d,"Once a bustling industrial town, Bhadravati’s future looks bleak",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/once-a-bustling-industrial-town-bhadravatis-future-looks-bleak/article17370467.ece,2017-02-26,"Walking through the residential quarters of Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel Plant (VISP) in Bhadravati is like entering a ghost town. Very few among the 1,000 houses are occupied; the rest are in a dilapidated state, some enveloped by weeds.This is not surprising as VISP, a public sector unit owned by Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) and a symbol of decentralised industrialisation in early 20th century, is set for disinvestment today. Another industry that was the backbone of the town, State-owned Mysore Paper Mills (MPM), has also stopped production. There has been a drastic reduction in the workforce of both the big industries.The local economy of Bhadravati hinges on VISP and MPM. Many families here are directly or indirectly dependent on these firms for their livelihood.For instance, sugarcane growers here are in dire straits owing to the decision to halt production at MPM. Transport operators too are now forced to look for other options.This is reflected in the overall population figures as well. While the town had a population of 1,60,661 in the census of 2001, it declined to 1,51,102 in 2011. The decline is directly linked to the fall of the two premier industries that once saw its population swell.Authorities say that it was owing to losses incurred by VISP and MPM that the workforce had to be downsized by offering voluntary retirement scheme and freezing fresh recruitment.Meanwhile, recommendations to modernise VISP and MPM have simply been put on the back burner.The government halted production at MPM from November 2015, and sent workers on mandatory leave. The State government plans to give it to a private firm on long lease. The antiquated production methodologies and change in the market dynamics caused by economic liberalisation are blamed for the loss incurred by these firms. There was a drastic slump in the price of paper in the international market in 2008, and import duty on the product was withdrawn by the Centre during this period. The Indian market was flooded with paper products produced abroad and MPM was not in a position to compete with the foreign players.International marketOwing to decline in the demand for steel and subsequent slump in its price caused by the global economic slowdown, the VISP had to suspend production for nearly four months in 2013.The delay in allotment of captive mine is cited as another reason for the losses it incurred. The captive mine owned by VISP in Kemmannugundi was decommissioned in 2004 owing to expiry of the lease period.The firm has been purchasing iron ore at a premium in the open market since then, resulting in escalation in production cost and sharp decline in profit margins.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs of the Centre had given in-principle approval in November 2016 for disinvestment in VISP.A delegation of the functionaries of VISP Workers Union met Union Minister for Steel Chaudhary Birender Singh in New Delhi recently and requested him to drop the disinvestment move and provide funds to modernise it.J.N. Chandrahas, president of the union, told The Hindu that Mr. Singh told assure the delegation that SAIL would invest funds to modernise VISP if the State government sanctions a captive mine.The State government has sanctioned a 140-acre captive mine in NEB range to VISP, but the firm is yet to get possession of it as there are legal hurdles to surmount.Sorry plightMeanwhile, the people in the town face an uncertain future. Eranna, president of the Karnataka Kabbu Belegarara Sangha district unit, said MPM used to to enter into buyback agreement with the cane growers. As the production has come to a halt, farmers will have to switch over to other crops.Deepak, a resident of Gandhi Nagar in Bhadravati, is planning to sell two trucks that he had purchased on loan from a nationalised bank three years ago. The truck was used to transport sugarcane to MPM and ore to VISP. With both these options gone, Deepak said he would clear the loan by selling the trucks and switch over to other business."

This, asked in the tone one might use to ask about the make of the cellphone you carry. The implication was that everybody has one. Clearly my new acquaintance owned a life coach (or employed one or consulted one, whatever the protocol is), and my not having one somehow diminished me.In fact, I didnt even know what it was. Was it a bus with an oxygen tank in it?When in doubt, google, as the philosopher said. So I did, and was told in no uncertain terms (or in certain terms, for those who like it less negative) that a life coach is not someone who is a consultant, mentor, adviser, therapist or counsellor. He doesnt even want to see you. One thirty to ninety minute phone call per week is what one life coach offers.Another says, We help you connect your head and your heart in a way that transforms your passion for your dreams into action for your life.So it is a bridge of sorts, a connector of the head and all that it holds and the heart with all that it stands for. This is looking better and better. So the life coach helps you make choices. Should you marry this person or that? Should you put all your money in the bank or under your mattress? Should you ask stupid questions or carry on as if you know the answers? A version of phone sex, in short, but without either the phone or the sex.Life coaching, I am told, is for people in transition, and assumed, naturally, that the transition was for the life coach going from penniless to millionaire on your faith and money. Apparently, that is not the case. It is the one being coached (coachee, to use the legal term) who is in transition and needs all the advice, mentoring and counselling necessary  although life coaches hate those three words. You can achieve your lifes dream online, I learnt, as many life coaches life coach online.I have given this some thought, and realised I want to get into the life coaching business  not as one asking the questions (theres no money in that), but as one providing the answers (thats where the moolah is). Making choices is a tough thing  should you have black coffee, with or without sugar, with or without cream, with seeds from Brazil or Ethiopia. See, tough. The life coach ticks your life (or coffee) choices.If you have to see a therapist, then you really need a therapist. It is the same with life coaches. Do life coaches feel the need for a life coach? Perhaps they do, after a period of immersing their personalities in the vast ocean of the personalities of their clients.Next time someone asks me about a life coach, Ill put on the mysterious smile much recommended by life coaches, and nod my head sagely. I might even mutter a name, just to be seen as an insider.(Suresh Menon is Contributing Editor, The Hindu)"

Interacting with farmers from different parts of Maharashtra, Fadnavis said, It is an irony that Konkan receives the highest rainfall in Maharashtra, yet its rivers run dry during summers with the overflowing water draining into the Arabian Sea.He dismissed the feasibility of the proposed river linking project on financial grounds. Responding to the water problems raised by farmer Santosh Dinkar, Fadnavis said, We have taken up the five-river revival project. Water management expert Professor Rajendra Singh is guiding the team on the project.The rainfall in the Konkan region has provided farmers with just paddy cultivation as their mainstay. However, water conservation projects, which are under way in Marathwada or Vidarbha, cannot be applicable in the Konkan belt.To Surendra Bulbules question on river linking, Fadnavis said, The states priority is to complete ongoing irrigation projects requiring Rs 80,000 crore and water conservation projects to immediately tackle drought and double the income of farmers. The two river linking works have been shortlisted by the Centre, which will entirely fund the project.Fadnavis, replying to farmer Yashwant Poples query on micro-irrigation and its impact in agriculture, said adopting Israels fertigation technique to improve the nutrient amount in soil, the crop yield will increase under the micro-irrigation model as well as with the help of water management techniques.He added, With five river basins and big dams, we have as a rule made it mandatory to bring the entire sugarcane cultivation on drip irrigation within three years. To provide uninterrupted power supply to farmers, the state will install a separate solar feeder for agriculture sector.Fadnavis said the financial implications had been worked out. Today, per unit power costs Rs 4.50 to Rs 5. We provide power to farmers at Re 1. Now this amount, which is given in cross subsidy working to Rs 3.5 to Rs 4 per unit, can be used for solar power installation, he said. The solar feeder works much cheaper. The governments solar feeder plan has been accepted by Niti Aayog which believes other states should also replicate the model.Outlining the advantages of solar feeder, Fadnavis said, The electricity cost on agriculture pumps operated on solar feeder will be economically cheaper, thus saving the government money. Other queries raised by the farmers ranged from climate resilient agriculture techniques to higher investments in agriculture infrastructure.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(PTI Photo)A meeting of political parties chaired by DMK working president M K Stalin on Sunday decided to observe a state-wide bandh on April 25 in support of drought-hit Tamil Nadu farmers. The proposed shutdown is an attempt to urge the Centre and the state government to immediately act upon the demands of farmers and farm labourers protesting in various parts of the state and in Delhi.The Centre should treat the drought as a national disaster and declare Tamil Nadu disaster-hit in view of the unprecedented conditions, a resolution adopted at the meeting said.The Centre should provide relief as per the law for disaster-hit people, it said.A public meeting will be held here on April 22 to explain the need for the bandh, the resolution said.According to another resolution, a delegation comprising leaders of political parties would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They will be joined by farmers staging protest for over a month in Delhi. They would and urge the PM to take steps to address the problems the farmers are facing.The meeting urged the Centre to waive loans taken by farmers from nationalised banks and help the state in writing off cooperative loans.The meeting demanded the state government immediately implement the Madras High Courts recent order to waive loans availed by farmers from cooperative banks. It also wanted 2017-18 medium term loans of ryots to be written off.Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president Su Thirunavukkarasar, state Secretaries of CPI (M) and CPI, G Ramakrishnan and R Mutharasan respectively, VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan, K M Khader Mohideen of IUML and MMK chief MH Jawahirullah were among those who participated.The leaders condemned the Centres stand that it had no plans to waive farm loans.Union Minister of State for Finance Santosh Kumar Gangwar had recently told Parliament the Centre had no plans to waive farm loans.Addressing the meeting, Stalin blamed both the state and Centre for not acting on issues affecting the people including river water disputes with neighbouring states.Another resolution demanded setting up of Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Waters Regulatory Authority immediately and convening a special meet of the state Assembly to discuss farmers issues.The meeting urged the Centre and state governments to declare the Cauvery Delta region as Special Agriculture Zone.Stating that the relief package, including Rs 5,465 for paddy per acre announced by the state, has not reached all the farmers, the meeting wanted the state government to immediately disburse relief.Condoling alleged farmers suicide, the meeting wanted the state government to give appropriate aid to their indigent families.The relief should be distributed to all farmers without distinguishing them as small and marginal. Similar relief should be given to farm labourers.Other demands include remunerative price for paddy, sugarcane, immediate disbursal of cane arrears to the farmers, increasing the water level of Mullaperiyar dam to 152 ft and cancelling Methane and Hydrocarbon projects.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5903ceac7be9e02646bd8288,How many pills  are too many?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/606412/how-many-pills-too-many.html,2017-04-14,"How many pills are too many?International New York Times, Austin Frakt Apr 15 2017, 0:02 ISTproblem of excess: Though many prescription drugs are highly valuable, taking them can also be dangerous, particularly taking multiple medications at once. NYTThe point of prescription drugs is to help us get or feel well. Yet so many Americans take multiple medications that doctors are being encouraged to pause before prescribing and think about deprescribing as well.The idea of dropping unnecessary medications started cropping up in the medical literature a decade ago. In recent years, evidence has mounted about the dangers of taking multiple, perhaps unnecessary, medications.Deprescribing will work only if patients also get involved in the process. Only they can report adverse effects that they sense but that are not apparent to clinicians. And they need to be comfortable weaning from or dropping drugs that they are accustomed to and believe to be helpful.Yet an increasing number of Americans  typically older ones with multiple chronic conditions  are taking drugs and supplements they dont need, or so many of them that those substances are interacting with one another in harmful ways. Studies show that some patients can improve their health with fewer drugs.Though many prescription drugs are highly valuable, taking them can also be dangerous, particularly taking a lot of them at once. The vast majority of higher-quality studies summarised in a systematic review on polypharmacy  the taking of multiple medications  found an association with a bad health event, like a fall, hospitalisation or death.About one-third of adverse events in hospitalisations include a drug-related harm, leading to longer hospital stays and greater expense. The Institute of Medicine estimated that there are 4,00,000 preventable adverse drug events in hospitals each year, costing $3.5 billion.One-fifth of patients discharged from the hospital have a drug-related complication after returning home, many of which are preventable. Not every adverse drug event means a patient has been prescribed an unnecessary and harmful drug. But older patients are at greater risk, because they tend to have more chronic conditions and take a multiplicity of medications for them. Two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries have two or more chronic conditions, and almost half take five or more medications. Over a year, almost 20% take 10 or more drugs or supplements.Some are unnecessary. At least one in five older patients are on an inappropriate medication  one that they can do without or that can be switched to a different, safer drug.One study found that 44% of frail, older patients were prescribed at least one drug unnecessarily. A study of over 2,00,000 older veterans with diabetes found that over half were candidates for dropping a blood pressure or blood sugar control medication. Some studies cite even higher numbers  60% of older Americans may be on a drug they dont need.Though studies have found a correlation between the number of drugs a patient takes and the risk of an adverse event, the problem may not be the number of drugs, but the wrong ones. Some medications have been identified as more likely to contribute to adverse events, particularly for older patients.For example, if youre taking psychotropic agents, such as benzodiazepines or sleep-aid drugs, you may be at increased risk of falling and cognitive impairment. Diuretics and antihypertensives have also been identified as potentially problematic. (The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has published a longer list of drugs that are potentially inappropriate for older patients. Note that, even if they are problematic for some patients, they are appropriate for many.)Relative to the mountain of evidence on the effects of taking prescription drugs, there are very few clinical trials on the effects of not taking them.Among them is one randomised trial that found that careful evaluation and weekly management of medications taken by older patients reduced unnecessary or inappropriate drug use. Adverse drug reactions fell by 35%. Medication use was reduced, along with the risk of falls among a group of older, community-dwelling patients through a programme that included a review of medications.Several other studies also found that withdrawal of psychotropic medications reduced falls. A comprehensive review of deprescribing studies found that some approaches to it can reduce the risk of death. Another recent randomised trial found that frail and older people could drop an average of two drugs from a 10-drug regimen with no adverse effects.Inappropriate dosageSo why isnt deprescribing more widely considered? According to a systematic review of research on the question, some physicians are not aware that theyre prescribing inappropriately.Other doctors may have difficulty identifying which drugs are inappropriate, in part because of lack of evidence. In other cases, doctors believe that adverse effects of drug interactions are outweighed by benefits.Physicians also report that some patients resist changing medications, fearing that alternatives  including lifestyle changes  will not be as effective. Other studies found that many doctors are concerned about liability if something should go wrong or worry theyll fail to meet performance benchmarks  like the proportion of diabetic patients with adequate blood sugar control.To reduce the chances of problems with medications, experts advocate that physicians more routinely review the medication regimens of their patients, particularly those with many prescriptions. At hospital discharge  when patients leave the hospital, often on more medications than when they entered it  is a particularly important time for such a review.Including nurses and pharmacists in the process can reduce the burden on physicians and the risks to patients.Patients can play an important role as well. Walid Gellad, a physician in the Veterans Health Administration and at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, advises that at every visit with a doctor, patients should ask, Are there any medications which I am on that I dont need anymore, or that I could try going without?'Patients, of course, should not try weaning themselves off medication without consulting their doctors  but deprescribing is an idea for all parties to keep in mind."

An examination later showed that the chopped snout was of 11-year-old Prince whose sudden death has grieved wildlife conservationists.The find led to rumours that the animal was poached and did not die a natural death. The Forest Department was quick to dispel the rumours and has reiterated that the animals death was not unnatural.Nevertheless, forest officials are aghast at the brazen manner in which poachers made off with the animals canines which, along with tiger bones, are highly valued in the international wildlife trade. A forest official, who would not be quoted, said thieves used either sickle or axe to snap the snout before guards could find the carcass.Strangely, forest officials who were baffled by the missing snout and the canines upon finding the carcass on April 2 didnt care to comb the area. The snout has been sent to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Bengaluru, for examination.Kishan Singh Sugara, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), said the tiger had lost some of its canines to old age and during territorial fights.Nagaraj D N, senior veterinary officer, BTR, who did the post-mortem, said, When the carcass came to the post-mortem table, the upper part of the jaw was missing. This was mentioned in the post-mortem report. The animal had died a natural death and there was no chemical substance around its broken face.Noted tiger scientist K Ullas Karanth said that going by the photographic evidence, it was obvious that the animals snout was chopped off after it died. He said the case was not the first of a kind but dismissed the suggestion that the animal was killed with a meat bomb.Sugara said the tiger was not poisoned to death. But there certainly was some mischief. An FIR has been registered and the case is being investigated under the Wildlife Protection Act, he said.Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest C Jayaram said the animal starved to death but refused to comment further until the forensic reports came. Wildlife conservationists have, however, accused the Forest Department of hiding the truth from the public.Why did they hide the fact about the missing snout while announcing the tigers death? Although its a natural death, the department has come under unnecessary suspicion, wildlife activist Joseph Hoover said.Bandipur Project Tiger Director T Hiralal denied the allegation and said a report on the missing part was submitted to the government and senior officials. We are investigating how could someone enter the core forest area and commit the crime, he said."

The whole tender process was over within 7.25 minutes on October 9, 2014. DH had recently reported how co-operative banks sanctioned huge loans on paltry security to Lakshmis company Harsha Sugars Pvt Ltd.The 295 applicants who finally bagged the tender on that day include Lakshmis mother Girija Hattiholi, brother Channaraj Hattiholi, who is also one of the directors in Harsha Sugars Pvt Ltd, and other relatives. The KREDL had invited online applications from agricultural landowners for the total reserved capacity of 300 MW. The government had agreed to purchase power generated from these projects at Rs 8.40 per unit.Documents suggest that Channaraj had bought agricultural land (survey numbers 43/1, 43/2 and 43/3) at Basaragi village in Soundatti taluk in August, while Girija bought land (survey number 548) at Madamageri village in Soundatti taluk a month before the e-tender process.Another beneficiary Iravva R Patil (survey numbers 157/1 and 78/7) received six acres of agricultural land through a gift deed in August.All these applications have the mobile phone number of Channaraj and documents suggest that the applications were uploaded at 11 am, within 52 seconds. When contacted, Channaraj said he had entered his number in many other applications as well and that there was nothing wrong in it. I am a businessman and well versed in computers.

Thirst is the biggest market force for a wide range of fruit juices and aerated drinks. The hot topic of debate in the city during the season is: which is better for healthAerated drinks or fruit juices.Activists of the Andhra Pradesh Students and Youth Front (APSYF) staged a novel demonstration at the Lenin Centre holding water melons, musk melons, coconuts and sugarcane asking the people to boycott aerated drinks and consume only fruit juices.APSYF leader Navaneetam Sambasiva Rao said drinking fruit juices to quench thirst was not only healthy for the consumer but also for the agrarian economy. The demand for fruits would help the horticulture farmers, who were usually small and marginal, get remunerative prices for their produce. He said buttermilk also was good for health and helped the dairy farmers.Specialists viewIt is the words of a super specialist that weigh heavy in favour of fruit juices. Ramesh Group of Hospitals Gastroenterology Department head I. Nalini Prasad said fruit juices were a better option to aerated drinks.Dr. Prasad asked consumers to go for fresh fruit juices instead of preserved ones. This was because the preservatives used had side effects in the long-term. Fresh fruit juices were rich in calories, antioxidants and vitamins A and C.Vitamin C would prevent the formation of kidney stones. Constipation was a common complaint in summer and the fibre in the fresh fruit juice acted as a remedy for it. Fresh fruit juices provide all these besides the required amount of hydration. Aerated drinks, on the other hand, quench thirst faster but cause intra-cellular dehydration. This type of dehydration resulted in the brain giving a signal to drink more water. This kind of thirst eventually results in the consumption of fluids without the necessary electrolytes, he explained.A lot of electrolytes were lost in summer and should be replenished. Coconut water was a good source of electrolyte, but it should be consumed within limits, restricting to just two, Dr Prasad said.Aerated drinks can cause gas problem and painful stomach cramps. In the long term, they cause harm to teeth and bones because large quantities of calcium were needed to metabolise (excrete) the carbon-dioxide in the aerated drinks. Teeth and bones are store houses of calcium in the body, Dr. Prasad explained.Kidney patients and diabetics should not consume fruit juice or coconut water, Dr. Prasad cautioned."

According to Action for Blind People, a British support organisation, those who have lost some or all sight struggle with a range of emotions  from shock, anger, sadness and frustration to depression and grief. When eyesight fails, some people become socially disengaged, leading to isolation and loneliness. Anxiety about a host of issues  falls, medication errors, loss of employment, social blunders  is common.A recent study from researchers at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine found that most Americans regard loss of eyesight as the worst ailment that could happen to them, surpassing such conditions as loss of limb, memory, hearing or speech, or having HIV/AIDS.Indeed, low vision ranks behind arthritis and heart disease as the third most common chronic cause of impaired functioning in people over 70, Dr Eric A Rosenberg of Weill Cornell Medical College and Laura C Sperazza, a New York optometrist, wrote in American Family Physician.Some 23.7 million American adults reported in 2015 that they are unable to see at all or have trouble seeing even with corrective lenses. This number is projected to perhaps double by 2050 based on the aging of the population and increasing prevalence of diseases that can cause vision loss.Yet, the Wilmer Eye Institutes national study of 2,044 adults found that many Americans are unaware of the diseases and factors that can put their vision at risk and steps they might take to lower their risk.Perhaps the single most valuable message to emerge from studies of vision loss is the importance of having a thorough eye checkup at least once every two years, if not annually. Many sight-robbing conditions can be effectively treated if detected early enough, in many cases limiting or eliminating the damage to eyesight.Four eye diseases  age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and cataracts  account for most cases of adult blindness and low vision among people in developed countries. Unlike many other ailments associated with aging, they cause no pain and often no early symptoms and thus do not automatically prompt a person to seek medical care.But a thorough checkup by an ophthalmologist can detect them in their earliest stages, followed by treatment that can slow or halt their progression or, in the case of cataracts, restore normal vision.Macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older, involves an irreversible loss of retinal cells that robs people of the central vision needed to read, watch a TV programme or identify a face or object in front of them.There are two types, dry and wet. In the dry type, the light-sensitive cells in the macula, a structure near the centre of the retina, gradually break down. In the wet type, abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula.Steps you can take to lower your risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or slow its progression include not smoking, eating lots of dark leafy green vegetables, wearing sunglasses to block ultraviolet light, and taking one or more supplements formulated to support macular health. There are also treatments specific for wet AMD, including laser surgery, photodynamic therapy and drugs that are injected into the eye to slow the growth of abnormal blood vessels.Diabetic retinopathy, the cause of most blindness in American adults, also affects the light-sensitive retina, damaging the vision of more than half of people with diabetes age 18 or older. The most effective preventive measure is maintaining a normal level of glucose in the blood through medication and a proper balance of diet and exercise. Blood glucose should be routinely monitored, high blood pressure effectively treated and smoking avoided entirely.Glaucoma, another leading cause of blindness, involves a rise in fluid pressure inside the eye that damages the optic nerve. It affects more than 4 million Americans, about half of whom dont know they have it, and is especially common among African-Americans and Hispanics. It can be detected with a comprehensive eye exam, which should be done annually for African-Americans and those with a family history of the condition.Clouding of lensAlthough glaucoma is not curable, treatment to lower pressure in the eye with prescription eye drops and, in some cases, pills or surgery can control the condition.Cataracts are the most common cause of vision loss among people over 40. They involve a gradual clouding of the lens, a normally transparent tissue directly behind the iris and pupil that helps to focus images on the retina. As cataracts progress, it becomes increasingly difficult to see clearly, impairing the ability to read, drive or recognise faces.Preventing or slowing the development of cataracts involves protecting the eyes from sun damage, not smoking, consuming a diet rich in vegetables and fruits and, if you have diabetes, keeping blood sugar under control.In years past, doctors often advised patients with cataracts to wait until they were far advanced before removing them surgically. This is no longer the case. Cataract surgery is now done when the condition begins to affect a persons quality of life or interferes with the ability to perform normal activities.The surgery is nearly always done under local anaesthesia on an outpatient basis. If both eyes have cataracts, as is usually the case, the second eye is typically treated some weeks after the first to avoid the rare risk of a postoperative infection in both eyes. The operation involves removing the clouded lens and, in most cases, replacing it with a clear artificial lens that often gives patients better vision than they had even before developing cataracts."

But a new study of postal workers in Scotland suggests, that number could be too conservative and that, to best protect our hearts, many of us might want to start moving quite a bit more.It has been almost 70 years since the publication of the London Transit Workers Study, a famous work in which researchers tracked the heart health of London bus drivers and conductors. They found that the conductors, who walked up and down bus aisles throughout the workday, were substantially less likely to develop or die from heart disease than the drivers, who sat almost constantly while at work.This study was one of the first to show that being physically active could lower someones risk for heart disease.Since then, countless large-scale studies have substantiated that finding, and at this point, there is little doubt that moving or not moving during the day will affect the health of your heart.But precisely how much exercise might be needed in order to avoid heart disease has remained much in question. The threshold of 10,000 daily steps, incorporated as a goal into activity monitors, has not been scientifically validated as a way to lessen disease risk.So for the new study, which was published this month in The International Journal of Obesity, researchers at the University of Warwick in England decided to advance and expand upon the results of the Transit Workers Study by examining another group of employees whose workdays involve mostly walking or sitting. They turned to postal workers in Glasgow.The Glaswegian mail carriers cover their routes on foot, not by driving, and spend many hours each day walking. But the mail services office workers remain seated at their desks mostly during the day.Researchers began by recruiting 111 of the postal-service workers, both men and women, and most between the ages of 40 and 60. None had a personal history of heart disease. Researchers measured volunteers body mass indexes, waist sizes, blood sugar levels and cholesterol profiles, each of which, if above normal, increases the chances of cardiac disease. Then they had each volunteer wear a sophisticated activity tracker for a week, while at work and at home and during the weekend.Afterward, the researchers determined how many waking hours each day the volunteers had spent seated or on foot. They calculated how many steps each person had taken.Better on footThe variations turned out to be considerable. Some of the office workers sat for more than 15 hours each day between work and home, while most of the mail carriers barely sat at all during working hours.These differences were echoed in the volunteers risk factors for heart disease. Those workers who sat for most of each day tended to have much larger waistlines, higher BMIs and worse blood sugar control and cholesterol profiles than those who frequently stood and moved, even after scientists controlled for age, family history, late-night shift work and other factors.The risks were magnified at the extremes. For every hour beyond five that workers sat each day, the researchers found, they added about two-tenths of a percentage point to their likelihood of developing heart disease, based on their cumulative risk factors.Meanwhile, almost any amount of standing and walking reduced a workers chances of having a large waistline and other risk factors for heart disease. But the greatest benefits came from the most exaggerated amounts of activity. Those mail carriers who walked for more than three hours a day, covering at least 15,000 steps, generally had normal BMIs and metabolic profiles.Of course, this study provides a limited snapshot of peoples health. The researchers did not follow their volunteers for decades to see who actually developed heart disease. This kind of study also cannot prove that walking or sitting caused the differences in peoples risks factors for heart disease, only that there were associations between activity and risks.But the findings do imply that there are good reasons to get up from our desk chairs and move, says Dr William Tigbe, a physician at the University of Warwick who led the study. It takes effort, he says, but we can accumulate 15,000 steps a day by walking briskly for two hours, he says."

(File Photo) Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. (File Photo)Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said that micro-irrigation for agriculture will not only save water but also increase the productivity. His government had also stepped up efforts to complete the incomplete irrigation projects, Fadnavis said in the second episode of TV show Mi Mukhyamantri Boltoy (This is CM speaking), aired by Doordarshans Sahyadri channel and other Marathi channels today.Micro-irrigation not only saves water, but experience tells us that it also raises productivity, he said.In the first phase of micro-irrigation, only the required amount of water is given to crops after soil testing. The dose of water is increased in the second phase, he said, answering a question by Madhukar Pawar, a farmer.During the program, the CM answers peoples questions, sent by email, WhatsApp or post. Some of them get the chance to be present on the show and ask the question in person.The Chief Ministers Office had received some 2500 questions from various parts of the state, officials said.Fadnavis said he was confident that in the next three years, most of the sugarcane farming would switch to micro-irrigation.We need Rs 80,000 crore to finish incomplete irrigation projects. We are working hard on it. State- and district-level committees have been set up for the technical evaluation of projectsThe Centre has agreed to provide assistance of Rs 26,000 crore. When these projects are completed, our irrigation capacity would see a quantum jump, he said.To a question by another farmer, Santosh Dinkar, Fadnavis said the government had undertaken a project to revive five rivers in the Konkan region with the help of Dr Rajendra Singh, the famous water conservationist.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Calling from a high-rise building in a suburb of Mumbai, they told her, in tones that were alternately earnest and melodramatic, that they wanted to share the details of a sprawling criminal operation targeting Americans. Broder, who was no stranger to whistleblowers, pressed the young men for details.He said his name was Adam, she said, referring to one of the pair. I said, Your name is not Adam. What does your grandmother call you? He said, Babu.' Babu was Jayesh Dubey, a skinny 19-year-old with hair gelled into vertical bristles, a little like a chimney brush. He told her that he was working in a seven-story building and that everyone there was engaged in the same activity: impersonating IRS officials and threatening Americans, demanding immediate payment to cover back taxes.If they reached a person who was sufficiently terrified or gullible  this was known in the business as a sale  they would instruct that person to buy thousands of dollars worth of iTunes cards to avoid prosecution, they said; the most rattled among them complied. The victim would then send the codes from the iTunes cards to the swindlers, giving them access to the money on the card.As it happened, the US government had been tracking this India-based scheme since 2013, a period during which Americans, many of them recent immigrants, have lost $100 million to it. Though India had no reputation as a large-scale exporter of fraud in the past, it is now seen as a major centre for cyberfraud, said Suhel Daud, an FBI agent who serves as assistant legal attach at the embassy in New Delhi.Several trends have converged to make this happen, he said: a demographic bulge of computer-savvy, young, English-speaking job seekers; a vast call-centre culture; super-efficient technology; and what can only be described as ingenuity. They have figured all of this out, Daud said. Put all of these together, with the Indian demographics in the US, and its a natural segue. Whatever money youre making, you can easily make 10 times as much.Pawan Poojary and Jayesh Dubey, best friends and college dropouts, were impressed with the Phoenix 007 call centre in Thane, a suburb northeast of Mumbai. The monthly salary was average for call centres, Rs 16,000, they said, but the bonuses were double or triple that, based on sales. The two friends had been playing a video game for up to eight hours a day, pausing occasionally to eat.At that time, in my mind is that I want money, Poojary, 18, said. Thats it. I want money. Thats why. They said they showed up for training in a room of young Indians like themselves, the first in their family to be educated in English. They were a slice of aspirational India: Poojarys father, who owned two welding shops, was adamant that his son would rise to a higher place in society, an office job. Poojary was afraid to tell him he had dropped out of college.The trainer assigned them names, Paul Edward and Adam Williams, and handed out a six-page script that started out, My name is Shawn Anderson, with the department of legal affairs with the United States Treasury Department, the teenagers said. We read the script, and I asked, Is this a scam?' Poojary said. He said, Yes. At that time I am money-minded. I thought, OK, I can do this, he said.Inaben Desai, of Sugar Land, Texas, came home from grocery shopping, and her mother handed her the phone, eyes wide with alarm. Someone was on the line from the government, her mother said. They had called three or four times while she was out. Desai, 56, worked as a cashier at Wal-Mart.When she picked up the phone, a gruff-voiced man told her that she had failed to pay fees when she got her US citizenship, in 1995, and that unless she did so she would be deported back to India, she said. When Desai said she needed to call her husband, a woman got on the phone, speaking sympathetically, in her native Gujarati.She said, If you involve your husband, theres going to be more problems,' Desai said. 'Your husband is going to get in trouble, too. Dont involve your husband.' Desai had begun to cry. Still on the line with the woman, she took all the cash she had on hand and drove to a nearby grocery store, where she bought $1,386 in prepaid debit cards. Then the woman instructed her to go to her bank, transfer close to $9,000 to the account of someone named Jennifer, in California, and then fax confirmation and confidential details about her account.Accessing personal infoThe bank lady tried to stop me, and she said, This is your personal information,' Desai said. But Im scared, and I faxed it to them because Im scared of what would happen to my family. The swindlers, who now had access to her bank balance, called back to demand another sum close to $9,000. Desai had to drive to another bank branch to make the transaction. The total amount she transferred, $17,786, was nearly all her savings.Poojary was not the person who called Desai, whose case dates to 2014. But a similar conversation prompted him to contact the US government. He recalled the womans name as Regella, and said that when she begged him to give her a little time, Poojary felt so sorry for her that he went to his supervisor, who told him to push harder. I just feel guilty at that time, he said. We are also Indians. We also dont have money. They also dont have money.The so-called Mira Road scam, named for the buildings neighbourhood, had moved into a single floor of the seven-story high-rise in early 2016. By summer it filled the whole building. Nitin Thakare, a senior police inspector at the crime branch in Thane, will not say much about the person who contacted him in September with a tip about Mira Road.But he will describe the raid, in loving, cinematic detail: How at 10 pm, after the last of the call centre staff had arrived for the night shift, 200 police officers streamed up the main staircase, blocking every exit and detaining all 700 people who worked inside.The officers interviewed and released 630 of the call-centre workers, arresting the 70 highest-ranking employees. What they had stumbled on, it became clear, was a branch of a much larger network, the police said. Five days later, the police organised a second raid, of facilities in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, which they believed to be a nerve centre. The US Justice Department had come to the same conclusion: It has since released an indictment tracing 1.8 million calls targeting US residents to five call centres in Ahmedabad that used various schemes to defraud more than 15,000 people out of hundreds of millions of dollars.By the time the police arrived at the Ahmedabad location, though, the syndicate was gone. The place where we raided, it was a thousand-seat call centre, Manere said. When we got there it was empty. Empty. Nothing. Not a piece of paper. Empty halls. Empty halls."

Although technology has bridged the geographical gap between people, it has left them feeling more lonely, unloved and ignored.This can make people violent, angry and irritable. It can also cause loss of concentration, sleeping disorders and nervousness. Since every behaviour has a reason behind it, we need to find out what is disturbing a person.The Central government is promoting mental health programmes to improve the culture of healthcare in the country. The nation and state-wise statistics of mental illnesses help us gauge the seriousness of the matter.Depression and other related mental illnesses are prevalent in all countries. One in every four people in the US and the UK suffers from mental illnesses, while in Canada its one in five people. In Australia, nearly 45% of the population suffers from mental illnesses. In todays world, depression has turned into a demon swiping away the essence of life from the lives of crores of people.It is a mental agony and the longer the condition persists, the harder it becomes to cope with it. But unfortunately, majority of people suffering from it choose to remain silent and avoid treatment. Hence, it becomes a life-long struggle.It can begin with minor mood swings to loss of concentration, to loss of appetite and can progress till the person feels suicidal. Findings of several government bodies as well as other reports suggest that depression has become common among teenagers.According to suicide.org, a non-profit organisation and website, a teen takes his or her own life every 100 minutes. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death for young people aged 15 to 24. Approximately 20% of teens experience depression before they reach adulthood, and between 10 to 15% suffer from the symptoms.Demographically women are more prone to depression and some even live their entire lives in depression. The loss of a partner, whether by death, divorce or separation, is the main contributing factor. But men on the other hand tend to end their lives by committing suicide.People with milder depression have mood swings and mood disorders and face many problems in life. Clinically depressed people can have serious health issues such as heart diseases or cancer, however diabetes causes symptoms that look like depression. You can feel tired or anxious due to high or low blood sugar. Low blood sugar levels can lead to hunger and eating too much.Early symptomsHowever, you can spot the symptoms early. Your body starts sending you signals of depression such as having a feeling of constant fatigue, lethargy or poor sleep. It can also be in the form of physical aches and pains which is not because of any obvious reason. There can be chest pain, muscles ache, trembling or hot flashes.Also, there can be problems with sexual desire and performance. It is also found that due to depression people do not just lack concentration but also face difficulty in remembering details and making decisions.Researchers have said that during depression, ones brain cells face difficulty to communicate with one another and the transmission of excitatory signals between the cells becomes abnormal.The hormone serotonin that helps in strengthening communication between brain cells fails to do so when depression kicks in. Taking cue from this, researchers are now planning to increase the ability of serotonin through diet, so that it can in turn curb depression.Several studies have suggested that researchers should focus not only on developing better antidepressants but also on a drug that strengthens and promotes serotonin. Also, a good and healthy diet that helps in uplifting and keeping good mood in people, besides strengthening the digestive system, can assist serotonin in its job.Moreover, it is advisable that people who suffer from depression and their caretakers receive guidance on diet and nutrition from a certified nutritionist, wellness coach or dietitian, who can help tame the demon, if not ward it off for good.(The writer is dietician, Diet Clinic)"

Express Around Rs 4,700 crore, in withdrawn notes, was collected from the DCCBs, which needs to be remitted. ExpressThe Pune District Central Cooperative Bank (PDCCB) is planning to seek legal redressal from the Supreme Court to highlight the failure of both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Nabard in initiating the process of remittance of old currency notes deposited at the bank. Ramesh Thorat, Chairman, PDCCB, said they will be consulting their lawyer soon to decide the next course of action.Watch What Else is Making NewsRemittance of the demonetised currency has been a major cause of concern with the RBI consistently deferring the process. It might be recalled that on November 11, the RBI had barred the DCCBs from depositing or exchanging old currency notes, following which 31 DCCBs across Maharashtra were stuck with old notes.DCCBs, thanks to its extensive rural coverage, act as bankers to cooperative institutions like cooperative milk dairies, credit societies and sugar mills. With over 2,900 rural branches, the DCCBs are often the only banks in remote regions.Around Rs 4,700 crore, in withdrawn notes, was collected from the DCCBs, which now needs to be remitted. The DCCBs had, in fact, moved the apex court seeking legal redressal from RBIs directions.The RBI, while defending its decision, had claimed that the DCCBs had failed to abide by the 100 per cent KYC compliance norms for its account holders.The apex court had then allowed remittance of withdrawn notes, while ordering for 100 per cent KYC compliance of both individual account holders and primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS).Following the verdict, Nabard had asked DCCBs to submit detailed reports regarding the KYC details of the accounts.Barring a few DCCBs from the Vidharbha area, all other DCCBs from across Maharashtra have submitted the required reports. Also, of the 370 DCCBs in India, 305 have submitted the voluminous reports too.Nabard officials said they are yet to receive any instructions from the RBI on how to go about the KYC verification, given the laborious nature of the job. Other than the KYC details, Nabard had also sought details of currency notes held by the DCCBs as on November 7, which most of the DCCBs had submitted.Meanwhile, DCCBs are stuck with stacks of old notes, resulting in excess expenditure on their part. Besides PDCCB, which has old notes worth Rs 574 crore, other banks stuck with a significant amount of such notes include Aurangabad DCCB with Rs 290 crore, Rs 315 crore with Sangli and Rs 102.37 crore with Solapur.Security expenses apart, Thorat said, the non-remittance of the notes is causing a severe loss to the bank. Various agencies like the Income Tax, CBI, ED have also visited the DCCBs for inspections.In view of the inaction by both the RBI and Nabard, Thorat said they are left with no option but to move the SC. Former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram had represented us in the Supreme Court earlier and we will be consulting him again. By next week, we hope to finalise our future plan of action, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

DH File PhotoAbout 500 local lorry associations will join the ongoing truckers strike on Monday, severely hampering the supply of essential commodities in the city.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bangalore Wholesale Food Grains and Merchants Association, said they received a letter from the local truckers associations, stating that they too will join the agitating truckers from Monday. Though there is some supply available with the retailers, the problem will intensify after two to three days, he said.Many will start purchasing their monthly kitchen supplies only after they get their salaries on Monday. The agitation of truckers, in such a scenario, will affect the common man, Lahoti said.The wholesalers have spoken to the suppliers from Kalaburagi, Bidar and Chennai, who have confirmed that they have stopped supplies from Saturday. The local truckers supply food grains, pulses, oil, sugar, chillies, tamarind and other items locally to markets and city outskirts from the yard. Vegetables come directly from the farmer to the market at night.Though there is stock in the yard for around 10 days and with retailers for three days, the problem will aggravate if the strike continues for two to three days. This will also lead to a steep increase in the prices of essential items, some wholesalers said.Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society Limited (Hopcoms) managing director B Krishna said that they have made arrangements over the last two days to ensure that there is no shortage of supply of fruits and vegetables to its outlets. But it is likely that there would be a problem from the third day. So, we are requesting them to make arrangements to ensure that the supply of fruits and vegetables continues, he said.Though the truckers have assured that the supply of essential items like fruits, vegetables, milk and medicines will not be affected, those in the market are skeptical.LPG tankers to join stirTruckers are likely to intensify their strike with LPG tankers associations deciding to join the stir, while petroleum products transporters will take a call on the matter on Monday, reports DHNS from Bengaluru.

Abdulahi Ahmed Ali, district commissioner for the pirate-hub region of Hobyo, told local press yesterday that the ""Al Kauser"" ship had been held off the Indian Ocean coast near Yemen after the hijacking on March 31.""We have the boat and two of the crew members but eight other members of the crew are still missing because the pirates took them off the boat,"" the commissioner said. Ali said the two rescued crew members from India were healthy and that authorities were seeking their colleagues. Their abductors are believed to be holding them near Hobyo.The pirates had ""refused a call by the local authorities to release the vessel and local forces forcefully engaged them,"" local security official Qoje Abdulahi told AFP by phone. Somali security forces exchanged fire with the hijackers who fled to the shore aboard a fast boat, taking eight of their hostages with them, Ali said.The Al Kauser was the third vessel seized by pirates in less than a month off the coast of Somalia, with experts warning that ships have lowered their guard in the five years since the height of the piracy crisis. The Indian ship was carrying cargo including wheat and sugar from Dubai via Yemen to Somalia's Bossaso port when it came under attack, owner Isaak Them told AFP.The president of the Kutch Seafarers Association, Adam Them, from the western state of Gujarat where the vessel originated, told AFP last week that the pirates had made ransom demands. Somali pirates began staging attacks in 2005, seriously disrupting a major international shipping route and costing the global economy billions of dollars.At the peak of the piracy crisis in January 2011, 736 hostages and 32 boats were held. Though anti-piracy measures ended attacks on commercial vessels, fishing boats have continued to face attacks sporadically.However on March 13, pirates seized the Aris 13 oil tanker and eight Sri Lankan hostages in the first attack on a large merchant vessel by Somali pirates since 2012. The pirates claimed to be driven by anger over illegal fishing in Somali waters which has long been seen as a key grievance behind piracy in the country.While some hostages have been held for as long as five years, the pirates released the Aris 13 and its crew just four days after it was seized. A week later a local cargo dhow was hijacked and taken out to sea, with the Oceans Beyond Piracy NGO warning it may be used as a ""mother ship"" for further attacks against larger vessels."

Spot LNG prices have also risen from USD 5.25 to about USD 9 per MMBTU on winter heating requirements. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is used for power generation.As per the data, food inflation basket witnessed contraction for the second month in a row with inflation at (-)0.56 per cent in January as against (-)0.70 per cent in December.WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)32.32 per cent in January, saw deflationary pressure for the fifth consecutive month. This was helped by a substantial price fall in onions, which stood at (-)28.86 per cent.Pulse inflation moderated to 6.21 per cent, from 18.12 per cent in December. Potato prices recorded sharp fall at (-)0.20 per cent, from 26.42 per cent in the previous month.Rate of price increase in egg, meat and fish was 3.59 per cent during January.Inflation in manufactured items saw some uptick at 3.99 per cent compared with 3.67 per cent in December.While the rate of price rise in sugar was 22.83 per cent, for fibres, it was 15.18 per cent, and 25.44 per cent for minerals.The WPI inflation for November has been revised upwards to 3.38 per cent against the provisional estimate of 3.15 per cent.The rise in wholesale inflation is in contrast to the fall in retail inflation, which hit a five-year low of 3.17 per cent in January.In its policy last week, RBI retained the benchmark interest rate and changed the stance from 'accommodative' to 'neutral', indicating that there will not be any rate cut in the near term.It may, however, have to review its policy stance in the wake of retail inflation touching multi-year low in January.The RBI projected inflation will remain below 5 per cent in the January-March quarter of this fiscal but hardening of global crude oil prices and volatility in exchange rates could put upside pressure in the next financial year.It said inflation will be in the range of 4-4.5 per cent in the first half and 4.5-5 per cent in the second half of 2017-18."

The jaggery has been brought to the market on Saturday. With the temperature levels soaring, we fear that the jaggery might melt, he said.The district is already facing drought and the quantity of sugarcane grown is very less, compared to the previous years. Hence, not much jaggery is arriving in the market. Only around 1,000 quintals of jaggery are available for sale, including mould, box and bucket varieties. Moreover, jaggery that was sold at Rs 3,500 per quintal is now being sold at Rs 4,300, he said.Speaking to DH, Mandya APMC Secretary Pushpa said, the truckers stir has affected the business as there are not much takers for jaggery.

He said, The real challenge ahead is to tackle the problems of the small and marginal farmers. There are 1.76 crore farmers with land holding less than 2 hectares and 67,000 farmers with land holding less than 1 hectare.According to the survey report, Areas under cereals, pulses and oilseeds are expected to increase by 3 per cent, 28 per cent and 6 per cent respectively while areas under sugarcane and cotton crops are expected to decrease by 36 per cent and 10 per cent respectively compared to the previous year.Whereas, the production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and cotton is expected to increase by 80 per cent, 187 per cent, 142 per cent and 83 per cent respectively, the production of sugarcane crop is expected to decrease by 28 per cent compared to the previous year, it said.The shrink in rabi crop area is expected to bring down the production of cereals and oilseeds by 16 per cent and 24 per cent respectively while the area under pulses is expected to increase by 22 per cent compared to the previous year.Declaring 4,374 villages taken up under the Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyaan as water neutral out of 6,202 villages shortlisted in the first phase, the report said, The water storage created is 11,82,230 cubic metres (TMC). In the second phase work is underway in 5,281 villages. Almost 2.26 lakh works have been completed in the first phase and 35,906 in the second phase. The total expenditure incurred was Rs 3371 crore.In 2015-16, the crop loan disbursed to farmers was Rs 40,581 crore through financial institutions as against Rs 34,100 crore during 2014-15, showing an increase of 19 per cent, the report said. The agriculture term loan disbursed during 2015-16 was Rs 32,284 crore as against Rs 21, 891 crore during 2014-15.During 2015-16, primary agriculture credit co-operative societies disbursed loans of Rs 13,293 crore to farmers, of which loans of Rs 7,089 crore were disbursed to small and marginal farmers (53.3 per cent).In 2016-17, up to December, average daily collection of milk by the government and co-operative dairies was 44.43 lakh litres.

Three mills- one each in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Nanded have gone for cultivation of the cane VSI had earlier introduced various cane varieties many of which remain in use.IN ORDER to make the sugarcane crop less water intensive and drought-resistant, Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute has developed a new cane variety Co VSI 8005. Shivajiarao Deshmukh, director general of the institute, said the new variety has been planted over 10,000 hectares and would go for crushing for the first time in the season of 2017-18.Cane crop has faced criticism because of its increased usage of water. Although the crop occupies only 10 per cent of the farmland, around 70 per cent of water resources are used by it. The cane crop of Maharashtra has been criticised as a water guzzler by both environmentalist and agricultural scientists. Even the Commission for Agricultural Cost and Pricing (CACP) has criticised the states cane crop for its over usage of water.Deshmukh, talking about the new variety, said it uses less water than the more prevalent Co 86032 one. The standing crop can withstand without water for as much as 45 days and thus, it is suitable for drought-prone area, he said. The new variety also has higher sugar content and its stubble can be re-used for three seasons. This variety will help in increasing the overall recovery of Maharashtra, he said. Three mills- one each in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Nanded have gone for cultivation of the cane VSI had earlier introduced various cane varieties many of which remain in use. Some of the varieties while having excellent sugar recovery had faced pest infestation which had curtailed its cultivation.In some cases, the presence of thorns had made a water efficient variety. The present crushing season saw Uttar Pradesh stealing the march over Maharashtra in sugar production. Uttar Pradeshs success was mainly due to the introduction of a new variety of cane Co 0238, which has increased the over all sugar recovery of the state.On Tuesday, Deshmukh also announced the winners of the the special prizes for both individual farmers as well as sugar mills which VSI confers annually. This year, the Shree Vighnahar cooperative sugar mill in Junnar taluka of Pune district has been judged as the best overall performer. Also, accolades were in store for the Nanded-based Bhaurao Chavan cooperative mill that won four awards. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will be distributing the awards on the occasion of the annual day of the institute on Monday.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Do not ashame me by referring that I am most able minister in the state. I am, in fact, the most inefficient and helpless minister in the government, Rout said in the assembly while replying an adjournment debate on closure of sugar mills causing frustration among farmers.Rout having 40-years experience in politics, said he had brought laurels for the state as Pancahayati Raj, Agriculture and other ministers.But, I have failed in the Cooperation department, Rout said.Rout, who hold the Cooperation portfolio said: I am pained that most of the members of this House refer me as the most efficient. But, in reality, I am not because of the hurdles being put on my way.Though the entire House including leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra of Congress, was surprised over Routs statement, he went on speaking that it was very difficult to run a democratic government under bureaucratic influence.The minister said he did not get adequate support from the bureaucracy to take up welfare programmes, be it revival of defunct sugar mills or cold storages which could help farmers to a great extent.Had we sufficient cold storages, our farmers will not go for distress sale of vegetables besides potatoes and tomatoes, Rout said adding that he now tries to set up cold storages with help of RMC (regulated market committee).The minister also said that though he has a lot of ideas to help the farmers and make Cooperation department viable, he could not do it because of the lack of attitude and cooperation from the bureaucracy.Rout also admitted in the House that the farmers are under duress for closure of sugar mills and cold storages.Earlier, Leader of Opposition Naraisngha Mishra of Congress had alleged that the state government failed to help the sugarcane farmers across the state. He said the farmers do not get their dues from the sugar mills run by the cooperative societies.Rout said there are five sugar mills in the state of which only two were in operation. Remaining three sugar mills have been closed due to several factors and his efforts to revive such units has faced hurdles from the bureaucracy.The minister, however, assured the House that he would again try to make such defunct sugar mills operational.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590451827be9e0264d1d3e93,Economic Survey Report: Maharashtra clocks 9.4 per cent growth despite demonetisation,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/economic-survey-report-maharashtra-clocks-9-4-per-cent-growth-despite-demonetisation-4574214/,2017-03-18,"Maharashtra, Indias most industrialised state, clocked an accelerated growth in 2016-17 notwithstanding the demonetisation of the high-value banknotes in November and the resultant impact on output as well as consumption. According to the Economic Survey Report (ESR) 2016-17, which was presented to the state legislature on Friday, the real gross state domestic product (GSDP) at constant (2011-12) market prices will be Rs 18,15, 498 crore, up 9.4 per cent over 2015-16. The state had clocked a 8.5 per cent growth rate last fiscal. In the post demonetisation period, the Centre had earlier lowered its own growth estimates for 2016-17 from 7.9 per cent in 2015-16 to 7.1 per cent in 2016-17.But what has sweetened the pot for the BJP-led government is the projection of a double-digit positive growth for the farm sector, which provides livelihood to over 58 per cent of the states population. Maharashtras rural economy, which has been on a downward spiral since 2014-15, rebounded on the back of a good monsoon spell in 2016-17 with a 12.5 per cent positive growth. After a dry spell of the previous two years, the state witnessed satisfactory rains during 2016-17. During the kharif season of 2016, production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and cotton increased by 80 per cent, 187 per cent, 142 per cent and 83 per cent respectively. Crop production similarly rose significantly during the subsequent rabi season, states the report.The positive growth story from rural Maharashtra comes at a time when BJPs ally Shiv Sena and the Opposition have been targeting the BJP over the demand of waiver of farm loans. Expectedly, the BJP thumped itsback for the growth projections.While Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was in Delhi leading a Maharashtra government delegation to meet Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over the farm loan waiver issue, state Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said, The ESR is a reflection of the performance of the government on commitments it had made at the start of the year. The policies and the implementing programmes we undertook to turn around the farm sector are bearing fruit.Slamming the Opposition for politicising the farm loan waiver issue, the finance minister went on to list how credit financing to the farm sector had improved under the BJP reign. The ESR report, too, included data on the improvement in the distribution of crop loans and agricultural term loans this year.Contending that the states economic growth had seen an upsurge at a time when most other state economies had either dipped or stagnated, Mungantiwar said the government will target a double-digit growth for the economy in 2017-18. The ESR indicated this goal too.Skillful fusion of technology, social structure, infrastructure backed by natural and human resources, along with the original way of production, development, and exchange ensured the leading position for the state in the national economy. The state is envisaging a double digit growth in the coming years and is putting in place necessary policies and implementing programmes to achieve the same, it stated.But the worry line for the BJP-led government in the farm sector was a projection of a steep decline in sugarcane production this year.The prime kharif cash crop in Western Maharashtra and Marathwada will see a 28 per cent drop in production  from 692 lakh in 2015-16 to 50,084 in 2016-17.Cane farmers and sugar millers have been protesting against the policies of the government in the wake of rising input costs for production.Mungantiwar conceded this was a concern.We will have to work for improving the situation, he said. Milk production also increased during the year.The growth driver within the farm sector was the crops sector.Satisfactory rains helped register a 19.3 per cent growth in the sub-sector, the ESR stated. But a stunted growth in the livestock, fishing and forestry sectors, which are all growing at below 2 per cent, limited the overall growth in the farm sector to 12.5 per cent.The government also thumped its back on the investments it had made in the irrigation and water conservation sector for the positive farm growth. Under the states flagship Jalyukt Shivar for drought-proofing villages, the ESR data revealed that 71 per cent of villages  4,374 out of 6,202 villages  selected under the initiative during 15-16 were now water neutral.Additional water storage potential of 11,82,230 thousand cubic metre had been created, the report said, while listing that another 5,281 villages were covered under the scheme in 16-17.While the governments economic report was silent on the impact of demonetisation on output and consumption across sectors, a stunted growth projection for the industry sector gave it away. The sectors overall growth rate slipped from 7.5 in 15-16 to 6.7 in 16-17.The current years projected growth rate is also lower than the growth it clocked in 14-15, when it had growth at 6.9 per cent. The mining and quarrying sub-sector dipped sharply from 4.3 per cent in 15-16 to 0.5 per cent in 16-17. The manufacturing sector decelerated from 9.3 per cent in 15-16 to 8.4.The construction industry too recorded a slump. But the power, gas, and water supply sub-sector upsurged from 3.3 per cent to 10.2 per cent.States fiscal managers said that the services sector too appeared to have felt the pinch following demonetisation with the hospitality, communication and transport services recording a slower growth rate. In the shadow of the demonetisation, financial services grew from 10.5 per cent in 15-16 to 11.7. Overall the services sector was growing at 10.8 per cent.The year-on-year inflation, which was in the negative zone from November, 2014 to March, 2016, increased from 0.8 per cent in April 2016 to 3.4 per cent in December, 2016. The rise in consumer price index was mainly due to rise in prices of pulses and vegetables. The main commodities responsible were tur dal, chana dal, urad dal, and some vegetables, the report said further. The states per capita net state income for 15-16 was Rs 1,47,399 as against the per capita national income of Rs 94,178.Another indicator of the demonetisation impact was that till December 2016, only 63.8 of the states projected revenue of 2.57 lakh crore had been realised. Mungantiwar said on Friday that the government will more or less meet the fiscal targets it had set at the start of the year.The states ESR report was also silent on the impact of the proposed Goods and Services Tax to the states own tax revenues. It is difficult to forecast the loss to the tax revenues at this stage. But the Centre has assured that these would be entirely compensated for, Mungantiwar said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590466c87be9e04154df656b,"White witches of food – Sugar, salt & rice",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/back2basics/white-witches-of-food-sugar-salt-rice/,2017-01-31,"The main concerns that trouble most of us are diabetes, hypertension and obesity or excess weight. Most often the evils that are blamed for these are the 3 white witches of food: sugar, salt and rice.Everything that is tasty has either sugar, salt or riceSo what happens to those tea parties or coffee meetings if we become sugarless and saltless? How do we enjoy our Indian festivities without the biryani and rice kheer up North and the Pongal and Payasam in the South? Wouldnt it be perfect to wave the magic wand at these three white witches and make them disappear from your diet and get the bliss you are looking for? Well, extremity is never the solution. The fact remains that though these are the major contributing factors to the above health problems, they are equally necessary for proper functioning of our bodies.SugarsI think I have managed to raise quite a few eyebrows here. But before you run to the nearest mithaiwala to get those mouthwatering gulab-jamuns, or to devour the death by chocolate at a confectionary, let me stop you. It is important to understand what kind of sugars are considered good and which ones are to be marked off your list.Sugars are basically carbs and are also the major source of energy. Carbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules either simple or complex, which are decisive on their absorption into the bloodstream. In other words, refined sugar, honey, jaggery, sucrose, glucose are the simple sugars. Packaged foods with fat free or low cholesterol labels often have camouflaged names such as fructose corn syrup, maltose, dextrose, raw sugar, cane sugar, malt extract and molasses but they are also simple sugars, which are absorbed quickly, causing a sugar rush. Meanwhile, sugars found in foods such as nuts, legumes, whole fruits, sweet potatoes, oats, have a slow and steady absorption into the blood. They are an excellent source of energy. They are beneficial in comparison to the simple sugars as they get converted to glycogen to be used as energy reserve for the body. The fiber is used for optimal digestion and the body also absorbs other vitamins and minerals making them a better option. They are required for the proper functioning of your body on an everyday basis.Both are sugars but all of these add up to the amount of sugar consumed by us on an everyday basis. It is the constant spike in levels of sugar in your blood that eventually causes diabetes to set in. So choose your sugars.SaltSalt enhances the taste of everything, undoubtedly. Practically all snacks have a generous amount of salt in them. All sauces have a high level of sodium content too. However, notice a difference when we eat freshly prepared food over packaged, food (or even food meant for storage). We will not need excess salt in freshly prepared food. It is an enhancer, a retainer, a modifier. Unlike sugar, it can never be consumed on its own, yet without it nothing will taste perfect. The phrase, pinch of salt has been rightly coined, because thats all we really need. Everything else is excess. Salt has one of the most important minerals. Sodium, which aids in nerve transmission, controls muscle dysfunction, retains water and electrolytes. In iodized salts, which is what we normally pick off the shelf, there is Iodine, which is vital for proper thyroid functioning. Both of these are very important for regular functioning of our bodies.RiceRice gives a feeling of immediate satiation and is directly linked with obesity. However, rice unlike its counterpart wheat is gluten free. Its consumption does not give allergies or gastric problems and is easily digestible. The main benefit of rice is the instant carbohydrate that it provides. It is instant fuel for your body. It doesnt disturb the gut bacteria and soothes gut flora incase of any intestinal issues. It is also a mood enhancer since it allows greater absorption of amino acids into the brain, which in turn gives us the feel-good hormone serotonin. If we eat enough fiber and protein with rice, it is the most wholesome meal that one could have. Rice is also good for weight watchers as a small amount can make one feel fuller faster as rice tends to expand in the stomach absorbing water whereas wheat (chapatti/bread) takes a longer time to digest and hence the signal of satiation can reach the brain much later.Hence, before we start the witch hunt, lets pause to think and actually eliminate the real causes of diabetes, hypertension and obesity which are overeating, stress and complacency or lack of exercise. If we endeavor to live an active life, eat our meals in limited quantities and at the right time, we can enjoy all our festive sweets and savoury. Happy eating."

Hundreds of thousands of people angrily deleted the app, believing that Uber had weakened the New York taxi drivers strike after Donald Trumps Muslim ban. A few days later, responding to the popular pushback, and Silicon Valleys own strong pro-immigration sentiment, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from President Trumps economic advisory council.Donald Trump makes one thing obvious: this is the age of the viral consumer boycott. If some companies have lined up behind Trump, campaigns like #grabyourwallet try to scapegoat brands that the Trump family profits from.Weve had our own social media tizzies, here in India. If you hashtagged #noAmazon, after discovering that the site hosted anti-national doormats, or if you were one of those who swarmed upon Snapdeal, forcing them to drop Aamir Khan as an endorser because he spoke of a new intolerance, you know that heady feeling of having participated. Boycotts can make a company bend.But these days, we arent holding companies to account for their business practices, but for their branding missteps, their CEOs political ties, and random unwitting errors. Were asking them to share our values. This is both asking too much and too little of them.Boycotts arent new, but their history has had distinct phases. From the European cloth bonfires of our own swadeshi movement to the British rejection of slave-produced sugar, to the way the world registered its disgust with apartheid and landgrabs by refusing South African or Israeli stuff, popular boycotts have given teeth to historic struggles.In the 80s and 90s, consumer boycotts really took off in the West, targeting global companies for their environment and labour practices. Giants like Nike, McDonalds, Shell and others were exposed and shunned. Their own branding promises boomeranged on them, and often, bothered by the bad publicity, shareholders drove changes. Its because of those skirmishes that corporations do better PR now, sometimes coopting activism. Goody-goody brands like Body Shop and Whole Foods took off, and there was a flurry of product labels attesting to ecological and fair-trade practices. Its clear that boycotts were effective often enough.Thats because they were professional, committed operations that identified a clear problem and mobilised action. Now, any injured individual can start and scale a campaign on social media. It costs nothing to add your voice to the clamour. It fizzles out just as easily.; its so easy to emote against a company that one forgets to organise, or even study the sustainability of the boycott. Its just about expressing a passing pique  like I boycotted Burger Singh for its bloodthirsty bad-taste discounts after the surgical strikes, Nandos after its sexist breasts and thighs ad. But I was acting up, not taking action.Unsurprisingly, these pinpricks seldom hurt their targets. Many fired-up Indian patriots tried to boycott Chinese goods after the Uri attacks, seemingly to protest Chinas support of Pakistan. Now, that was clearly a campaign headed nowhere  most of us are unlikely to pass up a good deal, and it would barely scrape Chinas exports in any case. Whatever the reasons, culture or economics, very few Indians base their buying decisions on vague statements of virtue. Even Patanjalis success doesnt come from a nationalist buycott as much as value for money.Some young, better-off Indians also pour their political passions into the marketplace. They instinctively relate to what Americans call voting with your dollars  that is, buying the change they wish to see in the world. They take brands personally, their shopping choices are part of their identity.Companies actively wanted this identification to happen, they wanted their brands to have a consciousness, a clear personality. But now, American companies caught in the political crossfire over Trump are dealing with the dark side of this personalisation. The boycotts cut both ways. For instance, Starbucks is being boycotted by the pro-Trump crowd because it announced its plan to hire more refugees.But really, whats the point of displacing our political powerlessness into an irrational war on companies for their seeming stances? It is one thing to call out instances of collusion between politics and business, but its wholly another to hate on a brand for not being sympatico with your causes. And in fact, such reactions obscure the real issues  how a company does its business, how it treats its workers and serves its consumers, plays by the rules of a competitive market, how accountable it is.So lets not kid ourselves about our power as consumers. If you think of boycotts as emotional expression against companies, you will only get skin-deep responses from them. If you want to make a real change, you need strategy and patience, not twitchy tweeting fingers."

This will keep you away from unwanted binge eating and ensure a healthy pregnancy."
5904675b7be9e04154df6673,Boosting Tamil Nadu’s agriculture: Case for private investment,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/boosting-tamil-nadus-agriculture-case-for-private-investment/,2017-01-24,"Land too fragmented in TN, needs to be agglomeratedWith a 62% deficit in the north-east monsoon, Tamil Nadu has been declared a drought affected state. Dr K Ramasamy , vice-chancellor of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University , estimated a 40% drop in paddy production in the current samba crop due to a huge shrinkage in area under paddy crop -from the normal 9 lakh ha to 3-3.5 lakh ha. This in turn will impact severely on rural incomes. The states relief for crop loss may alleviate the distress of farmers to some extent, but there is a need for a paradigm shift to impart health to the states agriculture that contributes a mere 8% of the states GDP.At the break of the green revolution, TN was a sizeable producer of foodgrains: in 1965-66 with the production of around 5 million tonnes of foodgrains, the state accounted for 7% of the national output of 72 million tonnes. Presently the states share is less than 5% of the total production (260 million tonnes).Among the many factors that have led to this decline, rapid urbanization of the state comes first. Urbanised stretches like Chennai to Chengalpet or Thanjavur to Trichy have witnessed large tracts of agricultural land being used for non-agricultural purposes like industry , services, housing, education etc.The second major reason is the fragmentation of landholding. In TN the average size of landholding is two acres. The small area is unsuited for effective application of science, technology , mechanisation or management. Many farmers abandon such lands after a point of time and one can see a large number of such fallow landholdings in areas adjacent to cities.The lack of perennial rivers has also led to over-exploitation of groundwater for farming. Yet another cause is the steep deterioration in the quality of farm extension services provided by the agriculture department. The issue of water-sharing with neighbouring states has also taken a toll on TNs agriculture.There, however, has been remarkable progress in the production and export of flowers, fruits and vegetables in recent years. The success can be attributed to a welcome focus on technology and management aided by much larger farm sizes.Efforts made in the cultivation of pulses have also improved farm incomes. But the state doesnt find any worthwhile place in all-India ranking in any of the major crops (except ranked third in regard to groundnut).The government, however, can consider a few measures to improve agriculture production in the state. The first is agglomerating the fragmented land holdings to much larger sizes that would lend for the application of science, technology , mechanisation and management. This will help transform agriculture into agribusiness. Punjab and Rajasthan amended their APMC Acts that permit leasing of land over 15 years without alienating land ownership and TN should consider doing this. The measure will help corporates and private individuals to invest over the medium term and derive the benefits of state-of-the-art agricultural practices.This will also provide wage-employment opportunities to small and marginal farmers and upgrade employment of skilled farmhands. Agglomerating landholding will also help farmers get better access to the various facilities, incentives and get better prices for the produce.For better productivity, it is imperative that the state moves away from traditional water-intensive crops of paddy and sugarcane and tap into the benefits of flowers, fruits and vegetable cultivation.As corn consumes much less water, its productivity can be enhanced by testing and correcting soil, use of quality seeds and proper nurturing. The countrys productivity of the crop is a mere 800 kg per acre against 10,000 kg in developed countries. A policy to make TN a large producer of corn would help.As the land prices in TN are quite high, the focus should be on raising high value crops with good potential for high productivity . The state should aim at becoming the top producer in a few crops with huge potential for selling outside the state and export. This will call for a paradigm shift."
590467f47be9e04154df677d,Budget goodies can’t sway the Indian voter,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/budget-goodies-cant-sway-the-indian-voter/,2017-01-15,"Opposition parties have made an absurd demand to postpone the Union Budget until after the elections in UP and four other states. The Election Commission should have dismissed this plea instantly. Indian voters are far too cynical and experienced to be bought by a few pre-election goodies in the budget. The Election Commissions code of conduct prohibits last-minute goodies to sway voters, but this must not abort vital institutional events like the Budget.The Election Commission must know it is somewhat ridiculous to set an arbitrary deadline for incumbent governments to announce goodies, since this assumes that the public has no memory beyond a few weeks. Actually, the public knows after decades of elections that most politicians are rogues that promise the moon and deliver very little. Thats why anti-incumbency runs deep in the Indian voting psyche.In some countries like the US, incumbents get elected repeatedly, sometimes for decades. In India studies in the 1990s showed that two-thirds of incumbent legislators lost their seats even if their party won. Without exception, every finance minister in the Centre and states feels obliged to offer some pre-election goodies in his last budget. Although history shows that this fetches meagre dividends, it is politically necessary to make the effort. It is typically futile.The exceptions have been chief ministers who have been repeatedly re-elected, thanks to demonstrably good and fairly clean economic development  Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Tripura, Chhattisgarh. In none of these states has victory depended in the slightest on last-minute goodies in the final budget. It has typically been the outcome of five years of purposive development.Some pre-election gambits have been credited with swaying votes but without convincing evidence. Besides, these are rarely budgetary goodies. Some chief ministers have announced big cash bonuses for food procurement over and above the normal rate. Some UP chief ministers have announced astronomical rates for sugarcane to be paid by mills. Loan waivers and cancellation of electricity dues have often been announced, but rarely at budget time.BIG PICTURE: Demonetisation, development and alliances are far more critical in state elections than the BudgetNarendra Modis speech on December 31 was a brazen pre-election announcement of goodies. At a time of falling interest rates, he guaranteed senior citizens 8% interest on fixed deposits of 10 years. He announced a cash transfer of Rs 6,000 for every pregnant woman opting for institutionalised delivery; interest subventions of 3 to 4% for lower middle-income housing; and a slashing of the tax on small business turnover from 8% to 6% if conducted digitally. Working capital loans to small industries were raised from 20% to 25% of turnover, and government guarantees for small business loans were doubled to Rs 2 crore. Thirty million farmers with kisan cards will automatically get Rupay credit cards. Interest will be waived for 60 days on farm loans for the rabi crop.All these goodies could have been announced in the Budget. But Modi chose to announce them on December 31. So much for Election Commission attempts to ensure fairness through deadlines, or the notion that budgets are the sole or main occasions for announcing pre-election goodies. Some of these sops may have fiscal consequences, but the banks will foot much of the bill.Many analysts expect the Budget to announce steps towards a Universal Basic Income for all. This has been discussed for two years, and has backers both from the right and left. Whatever its pros and cons, such a deep reform must not be ruled out on the ground that state elections are in the offing.Does any analyst really think that Modis new goodies or a Universal Basic Income will decide the coming state elections? Nyet. Other issues are far more critical. Modi believes people will vote for his tough attitude towards Pakistan, and the surgical strikes. Demonetisation is the big issue of the day, with Modi believing he will win votes for being the first politician to seriously attack black money, and opposition parties hoping that the bungled implementation of demonetisation will improve their chances.Other key issues include the forging of anti-BJP alliances, a strategy that worked well in the 2015 Bihar election. Caste and religious alliances are constantly proposed and broken. The Akali Dal and Samajwadi Party both believe they can win votes for economic development. The Aam Aadmi Party believes that its anti-corruption platform is a winner.These are the critical issues. Forget about the Budget. It does matter for the economy. But it is almost irrelevant for the state elections."
590468197be9e04154df67c8,Prices of important goods and services remain resilient despite the sharp fall in CPI,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/prices-of-important-goods-and-services-remain-resilient-despite-the-sharp-fall-in-cpi/,2017-01-13,"The fall in consumer price index (CPI) to a 24 month low of 3.6% in November 2016 is good news. What is even more reassuring is that trends have been steady with the price levels falling for the last four consecutive months. And the trends have accelerated in the most recent period with the fall picking up from just 0.2 percentage points in October to 0.6 percentage points in November.But the fall was primarily because of the slump in good prices which makes up for a little more than have the total weights in the index. Food prices which peaked at a high of 8.4% in July has now slumped to a low of 2.1% in November some of it probably aided by the crash of liquidity after the demonetisation drive.However, the slump in food prices has to be regarded cautiously. This is because some important segments show hardening trends. For instance cereal prices has been steadily picking up for the last ten months and has more than doubled to 4.8% by November. Similarly egg and milk prices are edging up and so are meat prices which are now moving close to 6%. Sugar prices have also skyrocketed for around eight months and is now going at 22.3%So the fall in food prices are mainly due to the fall in vegetable prices in the last three months with the trends accelerating to double digit levels in the most recent month. Oil and fats has also seen price increases slipping down sharply. Similarly pulse prices has remained almost stable in the last month. But this is mainly because of the huge base price impact as pulse prices were increasing by around 45% in November 2015.The skewed fall in prices of food products, the sustained increase in the price of cereals and high value foods and the possibility of increased volatility of vegetable prices indicates that the scenario is not as benign as expected. Global food prices have now fallen for the fifth year in a row and one cannot rule out a reversal in trends.Similarly trends in many of the non-food components of the CPI call for caution. For instance prices of personal care and effects has remained high at above 7% for the last five months. Price of educational services has also remained above the 5% mark for some time. Housing is another sector where price increases has been similar as educational services.Other services where prices have remained sticky include household goods and services, health and recreation and amusement where prices have hovered around 4% in recent times. Segments where price levels have continued to trend down is almost limited to just fuel and light. On the other hand price of transport and communication has steadily crept up almost four fold to 4.8% in the last four months.All this indicate that it is still too early to lower the guard on the price front. Prices of many services have remained sticky at high levels while those of many food products continue to perk up. Certainly it is now time for caution."
590468507be9e04154df6824,Eerie tax policies not only discriminate widely across industries but also handicap important sectors,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/eerie-tax-policies-not-only-discriminate-widely-across-industries-but-also-handicap-important-sectors/,2017-02-02,"Prime Minister Narendra Modis much touted make in India initiative hopes to make India a major manufacturing hub to supplement or even replace China as the new global supplier of goods and services. However, complex Indias tax structure is not only subjective and indiscriminate but they place a larger burden on important industries even while letting other get away with much lower rates and costing the exchequer a tidy sum.Some of this is highlighted in the budget papers presented to parliament yesterday. Numbers estimated from a sample of 5,97,884 companies show that effective tax rates was lowest in industries like sugar, which has a powerful political lobby backing it, which paid only a nominal 19.3%. But then other agro based industries paid a much higher 26.3% tax rate. In fact tax rate varied widely for different food industries. It varied from a low of 22.8% in tea and coffee to 23.5% in vanaspati and edible oils, 31.7% for flour and rice mills and 32.2% for other food processing units.This is not something unique. For instance in the health sector the drugs and pharmaceutical companies had a low tax incidence of 24.2%. However the taxes were much higher in other segments. Thus medical professionals segment paid 30.3%, specialty hospitals paid a higher 31.4% and nursing homes a very high 32.1%.The effective tax rates in the financial sector are equally disparate. While chartered accountants firms paid 30.2%, chit funds and foreign exchange dealers paid a little higher 31.3% and 31.9% respectively. However while leasing companies, money lender and share brokers companies were at an advantage paying an effective tax rate of 21.6%, 24.6% and 25.1% respectively non-banking finance companies had to pay a higher 29.3%. Rates were still higher for financial service providers (30%), and financial institutions (37.9%). But what takes the cake is the highest 40.3% levied on banking companies which is supposed to provide the backbone of the financial sector in the country.Equally bizarre are the grouping of the highest taxed sectors. At the top along with banking companies are the courier agencies who pay the highest effective rate of 41.7%. The mix of the other high paying sectors are equally weird. They include electronics which pay a high 35.5%, despite the moves made to incentive domestic production, and also forest contractors (37.6%) and security agencies (38.9%).While the much touted but stunted electronics and computer hardware industry pay a high 35.5% effective tax rate the much flaunted and widely successful software development agencies pay a much lower 24.5%. BPO service providers also pay a lower 29.4%. Similarly rates on computer training and coaching institutes are also a lower 31.7%.This strange tax policy regime is the outcome of various tax concession and incentives provided to different industries and special regions where the effective tax rates are minimal. However the government efforts to remove such anomalies and bring down effective tax rates to 25% has not gained much traction. This is a big burden too as the corporate tax incentives is estimated to have cost the central exchequer a massive Rs 83,492 crore in 2016-17."

To have been denied this Destiny is to have been in the midst of an American carnage.Trump declared, We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action  constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.No doubt that was insulting for the former presidents in the audience  Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George Bush, Barack Obama  as also to Vice President Mike Pence and the Republican party.But the Donald Trump constituency wont be crying at the death of courtesy. It voted for an Outsider and hes saying he aint forgetting that.Its kind of like how much the 2014 Modi campaign milked the idea that for 60 years India got all talk and no action. Actually even after the intervening years have leveled the same charge against him, it continues to enjoy a steady part in the Prime Minister Narendra Modi playbook.This after all was his defense of demonetization: We had to stand in queue to buy sugar. We had to stand in queue to buy kerosene. We had to stand in queue to buy wheat. Thanks to those who ruled for 60 years, this country was wasting away in queues What I have done is to start a queue to end all queues.If the speech sounds mucky to the critics, well it was never intended for them anyway. The Donald also has plenty of bhakts."

Cacao beans, the most important ingredient in chocolate is known to have the highest antioxidant properties, even more than most fruits like the acai berries, blueberries etc. which have found their way into the list of superfoods.Me, for one cannot bring myself to resist this pure orgasmic delight that finds itself creeping into my dreams if I havent enjoyed one with even a mere weeks gap. The luscious creamy texture melting onto your tongue, just a hint of sweet though, cause I am a dark chocolate fan. Give me chocolate for a bite, in a cake, brownie, ice-cream or crunched together with all the nuts and Im floored. My husband was the happiest with his easily satisfied Valentine till I started becoming a connoisseur and discovered the world of the most exotic dark chocolates: Amedei, Lindt & Sprungli, Patchi, Bovetti, Republica del Cacao to our Indian bests: Fantasie fine, Cadburys, Bournville, Hersheys and more.People are ill-advised to stop eating chocolate in pursuance of losing weight but why give up something that can give your performance a boost and I am not just talking about its aphrodisiac qualities. Rich in iron, its a fact that chocolate ups energy levels so you can push your gym training, or cardio levels to lose that extra weight. Ever tried a chocolate coated coffee bean or a square of dark chocolate before you hit the gym? You will actually get the caffeine kick required to move your butt to put in that extra effort. In fact a good dark chocolate is anything that has 70% plus of Cacao beans. Darker the better.But why chocolate you may ask? Why shouldnt I have just coffee then? Simple! Cause chocolate has the elixir of youth manganese and copper to boost collagen which results in radiant skin. The chocolate masks and body wraps havent just taken over the spas and facials for nothing. If thats what they do outside, imagine when the real thing spreads its antioxidant properties and rejuvenating qualities inside your skin. Flavonols and polyphenols in cocoa beans are known to be higher than that in most fruits. That means it prevents skin damage caused by the UV rays. The micro mineral, copper essential for your body which helps in absorption of iron, boosts collagen production. Magnesium which helps in maintaining good bone health and regulates proper heart functioning is one of the essential macro minerals found in chocolate. No wonder then that chocolates are given on Valentines day, since its got everything to do with the heart.Chocolate was supposedly discovered by the Aztecs in Mesoamerica back in the 1900s and was thought to be the Gift of the God of wisdom. It was actually served as a drink with spices and meant as a beverage for the rich and a celebratory treat. It was actually served by the women to the men with great passion as it was known to have aphrodisiac qualities. It is still served in the same way in Mexico and is known as Chilate. Its only much later that sugar and milk was added to it and then solidified to make chocolate bars. In the modern world I guess the tables have turned so perk up men and get your love all the energy, radiance and youthful playfulness you can. What better than Valentines day to begin a love affair with chocolate.!"

Ask me why? Its as simple. Because winter warms you up with a super food that is gajar ka halwa and hence we can forgive.Out of the many Indian winter staples, the one that tops the list for most people is classic gajar ka halwa. You may be a fan of exotic cuisines but some things can never lose their charm and this undoubtedly is one of them.Gajar ka halwa or gajrela is an Indian sweet dish made by cooking grated carrots with ghee, khoya, sugar and nuts. It is probably the most popular and certainly the most famous of Indian sweet dishes. It originates from the northern parts of India.In Hindi gajar means carrot, which is the main ingredient of this dessert. Although people in India will eat the halwa throughout the year, it is most popular during the winter season.So now its time for us to glide to the freezer, take a small frozen portion of gajar ka halwa and heat it to edible perfection. And it could be your everyday afternoon romance with this delicacy.Delightfully delicious, really who thought of adding sugar, milk and ghee to carrots, simmering it until the milk dried and serving it as a delectable dessert? Legend has it that the Sikhs from Punjab introduced it to the house of the Mughals. The emperors enjoyed its vibrant colour, flowery aroma, and slightly chewy texture, and it gained popularity far and wide spreading sweetness throughout the empire.So right now, pull up a chair. Take a taste. Come, join us. Life is so endlessly delicious; believe me, with gajar ka halwa on your plate.Heres how to cook Gajar ka halwa:RECIPETime to prepare: Approximately 45 minutesIngredients1 kg carrots1 1/2 litre milk8 green cardamoms5-7 tablespoon ghee5-7 tablespoon sugar2 tablespoon raisins1 tablespoon shredded almonds2 tablespoon chopped datesMethodPeel and grate the carrots.Simmer in milk with the cardamom until liquid evaporates.Heat ghee in a heavy pan and add the carrot mixture.Cook over a gentle flame for 10-15 minutes.Stir in sugar and continue cooking until the halwa turns deep reddish colour.Stir in dried fruit and serve."
590470e77be9e04154df6c77,The meaning of sports writing,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Arrackistan/the-meaning-of-sports-writing/,2017-03-29,"Why do you read about sport? Isnt being a spectator (at the arena or in front of the television) enough to take in the thrills and spills of the human endeavour for excellence? Is there anything beyond the scoreboard after the game is over?In India, live television has killed any meaningful readership for sports writing. The sports telecast caters to the primal questions of what happened and how it happened. Of course, the Indian sport writing in English is poor and pathetic but one of the reasons has been an undemanding and uncaring fan who is not interested in anything beyond the scoreboard. The moment he switches off TV or changes the channel he ceases to be a fan. That apathy towards sporting life has ensured that in a vast country with at least 10 million English language newspaper readership, there is only a single sports magazine which has an ever-dwindling readership.May be you are reading about sport to understand the history, context and consequences of a contest. You read to figure out the meaning of sport beyond the hysterical commentary, autographs and selfies.But do great sportsmen and women read about sport? In earlier eras, Olympic champions were hardly the masters of their own vernacular. To attain excellence you need to train hard, they would say. Apart from occasional biographies (inspirational!) about champions, that too before they heralded as heroes in their own right, young athletes may not read anything other than their own Twitter feed.Leave alone CLR James, how many of Indias passionate cricket (sport) fans would have heard about Neville Cardus, Ray Robinson and Simon Barnes? Or our own AFS Talyarkhan?Finding lifes meaning on the cricket pitch, football field or in the boxing ring is a larger sport. It helps if you care to read, to look upon sport with a fresh perspective and in a new light. A book about sport can be as riveting an experience as the recent India-Australia Test series played in India. Grab a copy of Matthew Syeds The Greatest: The Quest for Sporting Perfection (Published by John Murray / Hachette India, Pages 288, Price Rs 400) and you would watch the next matchbe it football, boxing or tennisas an enlightened fan, tuned to the subtleties of mind sport as well as the rigours of winning.Syed is a former table tennis champion, who represented Britain in Olympics and Commonwealth Games, and has been a columnist for The Times, London, a sports presenter for BBC and CNN. A two-time winner of the Sports Journalist of The Year award at the British Press Awards, Syed holds a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Oxford University.Bringing in Charles Darwin and Jean-Paul Sartre while discussing the mental game, Syed broadens our understanding of sport. One of the questions that Syed addresses is the triviality of sport. Yes, sport doesnt have the utility value a vaccine would have but it is the nearest thing where you could confer equality to two different men or women in an unequal world. You watch sport not for its beautiful tyranny alone but for justice as well. You are not watching a sporting performance for an incremental high. You are watching sport to figure out how far mankind could push itself forward. If the process of inventing vaccine had been an exhilarating one, people would have broken into labs. It is also important to note that people do not buy a ticket to watch elite sportsmen practise either. Borrowing from George Orwell one could say that sport is vaccine minus the jab, it inoculates you against the terrible iniquities and oppressions of daily life.Syed has separated his essays into five categories, namely, Building a Champion, The Mental Game, On Beauty, The Political Game and Icons. The titles of each sections prepare you to what to expect but in each of the essays you encounter different facets of sport and life itself. For me the most significant of Syeds essays are that which discuss the political game.In telling the story of former world table tennis champion Zhuang Zedong, Syed brings home the terrible prize Maos Cultural Revolution exacted in China. You realize how political sport is, how terrible are the consequences of victory and defeat. Syed writes: The more one immerses oneself in the moral confusion of the Cultural Revolution, the less one is inclined to issue absolute judgements. Villain or victim? The answer is strange but simple and applies to many of those who put their faith in the monster that was Mao Zedong.Syed discusses how the Fidel Castro regime used the Cuban baseball players as mere pawns in its ideological warfare against the US, denying them opportunities and forcing them to flee as refugees. He pulls no punches and writes: The despotic nature of Castros regime has robbed hundreds of talented sportsmen of their right to self-determination. Cuban sport is not the success story that its apologists pretend. Like almost every other area of Cuban life, it is a living hell sugar-wrapped in the make-believe narrative of a dying tyrant.The tyranny of a different order gets examined when Syed shifts his gaze to the America of the 60s. Syed writes about the interview he did not publish in 2007 after meeting former welterweight champion Emile Griffith whose terrible blows led to the death of Cuban boxer Benny Paret after their bout on March 24, 1962. When Griffith died in 2013, Syed wrote in The Times about the late boxers secrethomosexualityand what provoked the savagery behind those terrible, fatal blows.Compelling essays such as these answer the question of how you can profit from reading about sport. The meaning of sport writing is that it helps you see sport in clearer terms, in all its variegated colour, from the sidelines."
590471017be9e04154df6c93,Nothing rogue about this Khmer cuisine!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/nothing-rogue-about-this-khmer-cuisine/,2017-03-06,"The setting is surreal. Deep in the heart of the Cambodian jungle at a temple called Banteay Samre, we are sitting for dinner against a backdrop of lush canopy and temple silhouettes. Thousands of diyas and fairy lights illuminate the pathways and doorways, throwing into relief beautiful sculptures adorning the temple walls. The mood is serene and the ambiance gentle as we feast on delicacies from the Land of Khmer Kampuchea under an expansive night sky dotted with millions of stars.The H and I are in Cambodia to celebrate the wedding anniversary of one of our friends and this dinner, set amidst historic ruins, is the highlight of the celebrations. It is exotic and phantasmagorical: the clink of cutlery mingles with the sound of the anklets of Apsara dancers as they weave among the tables, performing the ritualistic movements that perfectly complement the mystical atmosphere in the temple.However, Cambodia is not just about temples or its well documented bloody history during the infamous Khmer Rouge days. It goes beyond the heritage ruins of the world-famous Angkor Wat and the serenity of its people. The countrys food culture, while not on the world map, is a rich amalgamation of French and Chinese cuisine as well as that of its neighbors Thailand and Vietnam. In the Khmer diet, rice and freshwater fish play big roles because of the abundance of both in the country. Other culinary traditions include regional must-haves such as fish sauce, palm sugar, lime, coconut milk, lemon grass, galangal, kaffir lime and shallots.So here we are, sitting down to eat a five-course meal showcasing the finest elements of Khmer food. The exquisite plating using jute, banana leaves and locally crafted rustic crockery adds to the aesthetic appeal of the dishes. We begin our meal with a water lily and tofu salad served in a pineapple boat. Between courses, the palate cleanser is a basil seeds and coconut milk shake poured into a traditional bowl and plate, with an ice carving propping up the arrangement.And the main course is a popular Cambodian dish called Amok. Amok is a national dish made from fish, coconut milk and curry paste. Amok refers to the process of steam cooking a curry in banana leaves using thick coconut cream and galangal as the main ingredients. While the meat eaters are given a choice of fish amok or chicken amok served ingenuously in coconut shells, the vegetarians are served steamed cauliflower amok.Accompanying the amok is another Cambodian dish called Lok Lak. This is a traditional Khmer dish, which is basically stir-fried beef in a light brown sauce, served with fragrant jasmine rice and pepper sauce. The vegetarian option is pan-fried tofu with a chilli garlic sauce. And of course, perched on the matted jute plate are the ubiquitous green vegetable curry and stir fried vegetables as accompaniments. The end of the meal is signaled by a dessert symphony: a coconut ice cream tiramisu flanked by local fruits such as rambutan, watermelon and mango.But the cuisine of Cambodia goes beyond curries and rice and fish. For the faint-hearted, the site of some of the foods on sale at the Old Market in Siem Reap could lead to an esophageal eruption to rival the Old Faithful geyser. As I am wandering the French Quarter with my friends, we notice a man with a bicycle stall selling (warning: do not read ahead if you have just had a meal!) beetles, spiders, crickets and fried scorpions. Forget about snakes on a plane! He is merrily waving snakes-on-a-stick and urging us to try any of the deleeecacieesh for a dalla. As my friends and I stop to see him swallow a beetle and a spider, he beckons us over and holds out a few black bugs. One of our more adventurous friends tosses a cricket into the air and opens his mouth wide to swallow it whole. Tastes like barbeque, he says with a grin, completely unfazed by what has just popped into his mouth. The bicycle man then turns to me and hands me a small black cricket. Put een gullee, he encourages, pointing vigorously at his throat. I look at the insect, swear it is writhing and with a grimace toss it back on the cart.As I scurry off to the sound of my friends chortling, I am thinking that the only gully-cricket in my lexicon is the one which has a bat and ball attached to it!"
5904717c7be9e04154df6d64,"Don’t underestimate BSP 3.0: This time, Mayawati has both a game plan and a formidable ground game in UP assembly polls",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/academic-interest/dont-underestimate-bsp-3-0-this-time-mayawati-has-both-a-game-plan-and-a-formidable-ground-game-in-up-assembly-polls/,2017-02-23,"(Written along with Sanjeev Singh)The big elephant statues stand forlorn in the afternoon heat. Its the height of the election campaign but there isnt a soul out to see them or the huge four-sided Brahma-like statue of Mayawati that stands as the centerpiece of BSPs imposing but deserted Dalit Prerna Sthal on Lucknows Mall Avenue.The predominantly Mayawati-focused imagery inside  as many as eight huge carvings depicting Behenji or her family  was one of the marquee creations of her last stint as chief minister (2007-2012). This time, though, Mayawati has responded to barbs that she only made haathis in power by announcing that she wont make any more statues because that work is finished.It is a message she keeps repeating in rally after rally. Behenji seems to have learnt the lessons from her 2012 rout and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, when BSP could only manage 9 leads in UPs 403 assembly segments.BSP has always operated differently: which is also why it is often underestimated. Unlike Lucknows other party offices bustling with poll activity, BSPs state party office is as deserted as the Dalit Smarak. Appearances can often be deceptive and so it is with BSP.It was the first party in UP to get off the blocks, appointing vidhan sabha prabharis just after its 2014 Lok Sabha poll debacle. By mid-2016, BSP finished its first round of bhaichara sammelans to reach out to upper castes. Mayawatis fortunes looked on the downswing for a while after a string of high-profile defections to BJP. But that didnt deter her from launching her first set of public rallies as early as August 2016 and finishing her candidate lists first, with minimal bickering.These tactically astute moves must be seen alongside a fundamental rejigging of what Mayawati is offering as part of what we can call BSP 3.0. The partys first phase under Kanshiram and his anti-upper caste rhetoric through the 1980s and 1990s constituted BSP 1.0. Mayawatis Brahmin-Dalit alliance of 2007 rebooted the party into BSP 2.0. Now, fighting for political survival in 2017, Mayawatis new makeover is her last throw of the dice.Her primary electoral gambit of a Dalit-Muslim alliance in a state with 20.5% Dalits (including her core base of 11.3% Jatavs) and 19% Muslims is key to BSPs chances. A TOI analysis of electoral data shows that there are 72 assembly seats in UP where in 2012, BSP bagged at least 25% of votes polled and where Dalits and Muslims together constitute roughly 70% of voters listed in electoral rolls. These seats lie at the heart of BSPs new strategy: 27 in western UP, 41 in east UP and 4 in Bundelkhand. SP won 36 of these seats in 2012, BJP won 4.Mayawati, with 99 Muslim candidates, is trying to replace Mulayam Singh Yadavs old Muslim-Yadav formula with her own Muslim-Dalit combo and looking to wrest these seats. Major Muslim organisations and Shia clerics like Kalbe Jawad have openly backed the BSP supremo. The Rashtriya Ulema Council withdrew 84 of its candidates in her favour. Mayawati also risked undermining her law and order plank by inducting mafia don Mukhtar Ansaris outfit Qaumi Ekta Dal into BSP, giving a fillip to her chances in some eastern UP seats.In an election where the Muslim vote is pivotal, the biggest danger for Mayawati is the prospect of it getting split between BSP and SP-Congress. So, she repeats a simple message at every rally: Every vote that goes to SP, is a vote wasted. She also moved swiftly on social media speculation about a possible post-poll BJP-BSP alliance to emphatically state that this will never happen. We are ready to sit in opposition but will not form a government with help of BJP.BJPs response has been three-fold. The first line of attack is characterised by PM Narendra Modis sharp portrayal of BSP as Behenji Sampatti (wealth) Party. Mayawati retorted with a sarcastic acronym of her own, rephrasing the PMs initials of NDM as Negative Dalit Man. The second BJP line is the one trotted out by Brajesh Pathak, a recent BSP defector who once led its parliamentary party and is now BJPs candidate from Lucknow Central. Voters understand, he says, that the Dalit-Muslim combination is an election move having nothing to do with peoples welfare.The third and most tactical ground move is to target BSPs Achilles heel of non-Jatav Dalits. Mayawati may have Jatavs but other Dalit castes like Koris, Pasis, Valmikis have all gone away and have come to BJP, argues BJPs cabinet minister Kalraj Mishra. Indeed, how non-Jatav Dalits vote this time will be decisive.Mayawati is also for the first time offering a broader agenda for governance. First, for her core Dalit voters, she promises to put SPs dabangs who have illegally occupied lands in jail. Second, taking a leaf from the Nitish and Jayalalithaa playbook, she is promising milk, eggs, fruits and biscuits in mid-day meals instead of the sarhi huee daal served now; bank loan waivers upto Rs 1 lakh for farmers and relief for sugarcane growers. With unemployment a major issue, BSPs focus on doles and a social welfare net is similar to BJPs manifesto promises.Mayawati would be hoping that her gambit pays off and her slogan of chalega hathi uregi dhool, na chalegi cycle na rahega phool (the dust will fly as the elephant plies, neither the cycle will move nor the flower stay) delivers. If it does: the idea of a Dalit-Muslim poll alliance will be a template that could be a national game-changer. If it doesnt, the very future of BSP may be up for grabs."
5904723b7be9e04154df6e9d,Softening price of services will help keep CPI in check,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/softening-price-of-services-will-help-keep-cpi-in-check/,2017-03-15,"Consumers who heaved a sigh of relief as retail inflation fell during the last six months, from 6.1% in July 2016 to 3.2% in January 2017, have now reasons for concern. With wholesale price inflation touching a three year high in February the consumer price index (CPI) has moved up in tandem pushing up retail inflation from 3.2% in January 2017 to 3.7% in February.The low level of consumer inflation at the national level hides more than it reveals. Consumer price increases are running at much higher levels in many states. It is 7.1% in Jammu & Kashmir, 6.2% in Himachal and 6.1% in Delhi. At the lower end are states like Uttar Pradesh with 2.8%, Bihar with 2.6%, Assam with 1.3%, Odisha with 1.6% and Chhattisgarh with 0.6%.One reason for the pickup in consumer prices is the increase in food inflation which has gone up from 0.6% to 2% over just one month. However, it still remains lower than the overall increase in retail prices. Moreover there is wide disparity in the trends in food prices with some products registering a surge while others continue to fall.Food products which are trending high include sugar and confectionary (18.8%), fruits at 8.3%, prepared meals at 5.4% and cereals and products at 5.3%. Food prices, which continues to fall includes that for products like vegetables (8.3%) and pulses (9%). Surprisingly prices of pan, tobacco and intoxicants seem to be soaring high at 6.2% probably on account of taxes lumped on them in the recent central and state budgets.However, volatility in food prices is to be expected, given their dependence on monsoons and their short shelf lives. What is of more concern is the trends in prices of services which are becoming an increasingly import part of the households consumption basket. Here the signals are more benign. Housing prices, namely rent, has fallen below the 5% mark for the first time in many months.Similarly prices of household goods and services have fallen to 4.1%, the lowest in more than three years. Similar are the trends in health and recreation services, where inflation levels have slumped to around 4% both three year lows. Price increases in personal care and effects have also come down to 5.1%, the lowest in a year.Softening trends are also noticed in some products of mass consumption like clothing and footwear where price increases have slumped to the lowest level in many years. The only segments where increase in retail prices is a matter of concern are in fuel and light and transport and communications. In the case of fuel and light price increases have now gone up to 3.9%, the highest in the last 12 months. In the case of transport and communications also the 5.4% increase in February is the highest since August 2014.So with food prices, which account for more than half of the consumer price index, still benign and prices of services, which account for another quarter, softening there is no immediate cause for concern on the retail price front."
5904725f7be9e04154df6ece,Super foods: Chia seeds,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fit-bits/super-foods-chia-seeds/,2017-04-10,"We all hear so much talk about the superfoods available these days. Honestly though, often, my head spins at the sheer number of such things available and I wonder how and why all the people who eat so many things which are supposed to be the next big thing/miracle cures for a bunch of problems still seem to have so many problems. Having said that, there are some food items that I agree should be incorporated into ones eating habits  the key thing for me being that they should be easy to incorporate and fairly accessible.Today lets talk about Chia seeds. What are they and where did they originate?Chia seeds are tiny black seeds from the plant Salvia Hispanica, which is from the mint family. It is native to South America (originally grown in Mexico), the seeds were highly valued for their medicinal properties and nutritional value. Would you believe, they were even used as currency?They were an important food for the Aztecs and Mayans back in the day who valued them for the sustainable energy they provided. Chia is, in fact, the Mayan word meaning strength. Aztec warriors ate chia seeds to give them high energy and endurance. They claimed only 1 spoonful of chia could sustain them for 24 hours and they were known as runners food because runners and warriors would use them as fuel while running long distances or during battle.Recent research shows that the benefits are even greater than we realized. Despite their tiny size, chia seeds mean serious business.Some of their benefits include:1. Nutrients Powerhouse: Fiber, protein, Omega 3 fatty acids, Calcium, Manganese, Magnesium, phosphorous, zinc, Potassium, Vitamins A, B  Thiamine (B1), B2 & Niacin (B3), E, and D, and minerals including sulphur, iron & iodine.Not bad at all considering you need a tiny amount and it has approximately 100 calories for 2 tablespoons (daily requirement).2. Fiber: One serving can provide the recommended daily fiber intake. Fiber is essential for the bodys ability to balance insulin levels. Chia Seeds can be a natural blood sugar balancer due to their high fiber content and healthy fats.It also helps promote regular bowel movement and healthy stools. Yay for Number2! The rich fiber content in chia seeds helps you feel more full faster because it absorbs a considerable amount of water and immediately expands in the stomach when eaten. This explains how chia curbs hunger and suppresses appetite, which can also lead to weight loss (another great reason to have them).Chia seeds create a gelatin-like substance in the stomach due to the soluble fiber in them and it can work as a prebiotic supporting the growth of probiotics in the gut. In addition, they have a good balance of essential amino acids which is great news for vegetarians and vegans.3. Heart Health: Chia seeds ability to reverse inflammation, regulate cholesterol and lower blood pressure make it extremely beneficial to consume for heart health. It also reverses oxidative stress so one is less likely to develop atherosclerosis when theyre regularly eating chia seeds.Chia seeds are high in linoleic acid, a fatty acid that helps the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Chia is quite high in healthy fats, apparently containing more Omega-3 than salmon even! Omega-3s protect the heart by lowering blood pressure, bad cholesterol (LDL), and inflammation (which puts a strain on blood vessels and cause heart disease).4. Helps Treat Diabetes: Because chia seeds are rich in ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) and fiber they can help prevent metabolic disorders like dyslipidemia (excessive fat in the blood) and insulin resistance  which are two factors in the development of diabetes.5. Boost Energy & Metabolism: Some recent studies concluded that consuming chia seeds enhanced exercise performance for workouts that lasted 90 minutes the same way a sugar-laden sports drink would, but WITHOUT the sugar.By adding a serving of chia seeds to your daily diet, you can help boost your metabolism and burn belly fat as well! Studies show adding chia seeds to your diet also reduces visceral adipose fat (belly fat) that affects the bodys metabolism and causes obesity!6. Aging & Skin: Recently, it was discovered chia seeds had an antioxidant concentration nearly 2X higher than previously reported and its activity was shown to stop up to 70% of free radical activity, essentially proving that chia seeds are among the richest antioxidants which speed up the skins repair process and prevent further damage. Taking the seeds can prevent premature skin aging due to inflammation free radical damage.7. Stronger Bones: One ounce of chia seeds has 18% of the recommended daily amount of calcium which we all know is very important for maintaining good bone health, strength and mass. Chia also contains boron which helps metabolize calcium, magnesium, manganese, and phosphorus for healthy growth of bones and muscles.8. Protein: Chia seeds rank among the top plant based sources of protein. Yet another reason to consume it for those trying to gain lean muscle & burn fat. Chia seeds pack a strong punch to help replace some of the nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc, iron and niacin lost when exercising.Because it can absorb upto 10X its own weight in water, chia seeds can prolong hydration and improve nutrient absorption of electrolytes slowing digestion and keeping you feeling fuller longer, reducing sugar cravings.And since chia seeds are also high in zinc, they help your body increase leptin a key hormone that regulates your appetite, how your body spends energy and regulates your energy levels! It improves stamina and endurance, making chia a great source of nutrition if youre looking to get fit.9. Fights Breast and Cervical Cancer: Chia seeds are rich in alpha lineic acid (or ALA) which is an Omega-3 fatty acid. It was recently found ALA limited the growth of cancer cells in both breast and cervical cancers in addition to causing death of cancer cells without harming the healthy cells.10. Great during pregnancy  child bearing is very hard on the body. Chia seeds help replace some of the nutrients lost by the expecting mother during the pregnancy.a). Calcium: Its extremely important to get adequate amounts of calcium for proper skeletal development of the baby during the last trimester of pregnancy which is almost 5X more in chia seeds compared to milk. They also contain boron, another critical mineral for bone health.b). Iron: Chia seeds provide iron which is essential for developing red blood cells to transport oxygen through the body, its needed in increased amounts in order to accommodate the mothers increased blood volume and for the development of the babys blood.c). Slows sugar absorption: High blood sugar greatly increases complications in pregnancy such as high birth weight, increased chances of C-section deliveries and preeclampsia. When consumed, chia seeds create a gelatin-like substance in the stomach which slows digestion and keeps blood sugar levels stable.d). Energy Booster: it slows down the process of converting sugars and carbohydrates from the seeds into energy. This slow-burning process, combined with the high protein content gives sustained energy release.You can easily add chia seeds to most dishes, from everything like smoothies to soups & desserts. The best way to access their vitamins and minerals is to soak them.Chia seeds are among the few trendy superfoods that I personally believe is worthy of the term.They are definitely not cheap but for the benefits they provide and considering the small amount you need daily  I definitely recommend them & no Im not being endorsed by anyone to write about them. If you havent yet started eating them, what are you waiting for?"
5904726c7be9e04154df6ee5,Why smart cities? I’d rather have smarter villages,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/musings-from-the-mountains/84922/,2017-04-02,"Its good to know that my old friend the jackfruit is finally coming into its own. Apparently it is now much in demand in western countries, a fashionable substitute for meat fillings for burgers, sandwiches, pies etc, with one enthusiast even calling it mutton hanging from a tree.Here in India we have always appreciated a good jackfruit curry, or even better, a jackfruit pickle. Im a pickle fiend myself, and among the 20 different pickles on my sideboard there is always a jar of jackfruit pickle; thats why I call it an old friend. But I had no idea it tasted like mutton. The seed and the pulp have their own individual flavour. As it grows on a tree we call it fruit, but we cook it as though it were a vegetable. And if, to some, it tastes like mutton, then perhaps some meat-eaters will become vegetarians. On the other hand, some vegetarians might not care for its meaty flavour!When I was a boy, we had an old jackfruit tree growing beside the side veranda. I spent a lot of time in the trees surrounding my grandmothers bungalow, and this one was easy to climb. The others included several guava and litchi trees, lemons and grape-fruits, and of course a couple of mango trees  but these last were difficult to climb.Why do you spend so much time in the trees? complained my grandmother. Why not do something useful for a change?The trees are my brothers, I would say, I like to play with them.And I still think of them as my brothers, although I can no longer climb trees or play in them.And indeed I think of them as human beings possessed of individuality and charm. Just as no two humans are exactly alike (unless they happen to be twins), so no two trees are the same. Like humans they grow from seed. They develop branches as arms and leaves like flowing hair. We give birth to children; they give birth to fruits and flowers. We shelter our young, they shelter small creatures of the forest.But unlike us, they spring from the soil, from the land  that very land that gives us food and pasture and protection; the land that we so casually take for granted, preferring to build upon it rather than grow upon it. Where will our cattle graze when the last green spaces have gone?No problem, says a young friend. We can always import our milk.The other day I came across an old book that had been on my shelves for many years: Farmers Glory by A G Street, written over 60 years ago. In his epilogue he writes: It is perhaps nothing to boast about, but there is little doubt that the present prosperity of British farming is mainly due to one man, who is now dead. His name was Adolf Hitler. There is no disputing that it was the fear of famine during the early 1940s that taught the British nation that despite all mans cleverness and inventions, when real danger comes an island people must turn for succour to the only permanent asset they possess, the land of their own country. It has never, and will never, let them down; always provided they realise and obey this eternal truth  that to make the land serve man, man must first be content to serve the land.And surely it is this love of the land and willingness to serve it that is at the heart of patriotism. The patriotic songs and speeches that we hear from time to time are fine for stirring up the emotions, but it is really the connect between ourselves and the do bigha zameen on which we grow our fruit and grain that emboldens us to protect it.I think I am correct in saying that most of our jawans, the young men who join the solid ranks of the Indian Army, come from rural backgrounds; some from the hills, some from the vast plains and hinterland of our country. They know the value of the land. They have grown up in the villages and have worked with their families in the rice fields, or sugarcane plantations, or mango groves, or wheat or corn or mustard or fields of an infinite variety of crops. More than the city folk, they know the value of the land, its true worth in terms of either prosperity or poverty. And so they are ready to defend it, to fight for it against all corners. The best soldiers come from the soil that they and their forefathers have tilled. So let us protect the land  not only from the intruder or the enemy, but from those who would turn the field or the forest into one more concrete jungle.But of course there are those who prefer concrete jungles.

This is substantially lower than 5.5% inflation at the start of the year and much lower than the 6.1% peak rate clocked in July 2016. The average monthly growth in consumer prices in the fiscal year 2016-17 is 4.5% which is the lowest since the current 2012 series was brought in 2012-13. These numbers in fact shows that consumer inflation has steadily fallen from a peak level of 10% in 2012-13 to 9.4% in 2013-14 then to 5.8% in 2014-15 and further to 4.9% in 2015-16 and now finally to 4.5% in 2016-17.However, the trends were not uniform trends through the year. Consumer inflation picked up in the first four months to peak levels and then steadily slowed down to a low of 3.2% by January 2017 and inflation levels have once again picked up since then. The major factor that helped keep consumer prices in check in 2016-17 was the food and beverage segment, which accounts for 46% of the consumer index, and which plummeted below the 3% mark in the last five months after peaking at a high 8% in July.However the softening of the food prices in recent months hide very disparate trends in important components For instance prices of cereals have steadily hardened over the year steadily moving up from a low of 2.5% in April 2016 to a high of 5.4% in March 2017. Similarly price of milk products has also peaked at a yearly high of 4.7% in March this year. Price of sugar and confectionary fluctuated moving up from 11.2% in April 2016 to 17% in March this year after peaking at 25.9% in September. But the highest rise in prices was in the case of fruits where inflation levels shot up from a low of 1.7% at the start of the year to a high of 9.4% by the end of the year.Inflation levels in most other food products have generally slithered down. This would include that of items like meat and fish, eggs, oil and fat and pulses. The dip in prices of pulses was the highest with the numbers shrinking by double digit levels at the end of the year from a peak level of 34.2% at the start of the year. Prices of vegetables which soared at double digit levels at the start of the year have also steadily fallen in the last six consecutive months.Despite the fall in food prices the other components of the CPI did not show any substantial changes. The trends were mixed. For example increase in prices of fuel and light and that of transport and communication services almost doubled or trebled. And in case of other important components like housing, household goods and services, recreation and amusement and education prices tended to be sticky even while they softened marginally. Only in case of health and personal care and effects did prices register a noteworthy fall.All this only underlines the fact that despite the five year low the CPI index can still swing up depending on the trends in fuel and food prices in the current year. While the former is dependent on international developments the latter will be influenced by the monsoon and weather conditions. This underlines the need for caution before making any major changes in policies."

It is true that when excess sugar is digested and absorbed, it can be stored as fat, but if youre eating when youre hungry and not overeating, this will definitely not happen from eating a 100-calorie banana.Myth: Banana Contains Too Much SugarBananas contain, on an average, 3 grams of fiber, which slows the absorption of sugar into our blood. Some of this fiber comes from pectins, which further slows the digestion of carbohydrates, lessening a blood glucose (sugar) spike. If youve been diagnosed with diabetes or have been told that your blood sugar is a little high, you can still enjoy bananas. To lessen the sugar spike, pair a banana with protein and healthy fat such as a nut or seed butter or yogurt."

Except, there is nothing bad about building fame and fortune from humble beginnings. She didnt start out with lots of education or English, a sugar daddy or a pedigreed mummy, it was only spunk that she had in abundance.

Cane development minister Suresh Rana has constituted a committee of three joint commissioners to identify backward villages throughout the state and prepare modalities on how these could be developed. Rana is planning for a May launch.Directives have been given to identify backward villages in areas where sugar mills are situated, Rana told TOI. Every industrial unit has a provision to spend 2% of profit on CSR activity.""We are not going to direct them but seek cooperation from them and request them to develop the adopted gradually through CSR,"" Rana said.The department would request mills to ensure toilets in schools, install solar lights, conduct cleanliness drive and install at least one RO plant in the village for drinking water.As in the case of village adoption by MPs, sugar mills will also be asked to oversee whether all Centre and state-sponsored schemes are reaching the adopted village or not, Rana added.After receiving the report of the committee in about a month, the cane development department would approach mills and request them to develop the identified villages, Rana said.At a time when sugar mills have failed to give cane dues to farmers for years, it would be interesting to see if mill owners would adhere to the minister's request.The UP government has decided that pending cane dues to farmers would be paid within 120 days while dues for the current fiscal are to be paid to farmers within 14 days."

The study suggests higher tax can avert at least 4 lakh cardiac deaths. Similarly, prevalence of obesity is also as high as 22% among adults as well as children in India.Hypertension is also fast growing in India with a prevalence rate of 25.4% among adults. However, the study shows a higher tax of up to 20% in palm oil alone is projected to avert around 3,63,000 deaths from myocardial infarctions and strokes over the period 2014-23 (1.3% reduction in cardiovascular deaths).Palm oil, consumed widely in low and middle income countries, is high in saturated fat and causes a large increase in cholesterol concentrations.""Strong regulatory framework is essential to ensure compliance.

But this said, there's no denying that these make for wonderful holiday indulgence! So, we decided to head out on an egg hunt of our own, and boy, were we spoilt for choice!Giving into her cravings for some warm, home-crafted bread, chef and food blogger Sneha Bhave is planning a real bread feast or sorts at home, this time.She'll start with Pane di Pasqua: traditional Italian Easter bread. ""It's sweeter than regular bread,"" says Sneha, who admits that the dough takes longer to ferment owing to its rich consistency of milk and sugar. The highlight, however, is the coloured egg that the dough is braided around. ""The raw egg needs to be dyed before braiding and putting the bread for baking,"" says Sneha. Since it contains sugar, the bread tends to brown faster, so keep a watchful eye, she warns. Throw a generous lot of raisins into the dough for more taste and texture. For garnish, silver sugar sprinkles would seal the deal.Next up are some fine jam orchocolate-filled bunny rolls (a fancy spin-off from dinner rolls). But stuffing the dough demands precision. ""Make sure there are no creases from which the filling can ooze out. You also need to be quick with shaping; there's no time for retakes!"" says Sneha, adding that thick custard could be another option for the filling.Those who prefer something more savoury could make these rolls with sour dough. But Sneha's bunny with a cooling yogurt dip (spiced with crushed black pepper corn, green or red chilly flakes, mint leaves and grated cheese) might be worth a try, too.After everyone at home said they'd skip the chocolate and marzipan and be more health-conscious this time, home baker Shradha Menon has decided to bake some wheat cookies for a change. She says, ""Making them isn't difficult, though the rising temperature can give you quite a tough time!"" Keeping in mind the symbols of the season, all significant of new life, Shradha is fashioning her cookies to look like eggs, bunnies and chicks. ""I'll top them with royal icing and fondant art,"" she adds.But if making these healthy Easter treats sounds like a task, Fedora Fernandes' healthy Easter goodies are your saving grace. ""We're excited to be doing healthy treats for the first time. All of them will be sugar, dairy and gluten-free,"" says Fedora.They might be 'one a penny, two a penny'; but there's reason why the golden-glazed hot cross buns are synonymous with Good Friday (which was observed yesterday).Food blogger Hilda Mascarenhas, who specialises in Goan cuisine, says, ""After forty days of fast and prayer, these buns are made to symbolise that Lent is over and we now look forward to Easter."" Containing milk, sugar and a generous lot of currants or raisins, the highlight, however, is the cross marking each bun, a reminder of Christ's death on the cross.Before you set out on an Easter goodie-buying spree, you might want to take a look at some of the most adorable creations we came across...(Pics: Nikhil Vidyasagar and Hilda's Touch of Spice)"

In an interview to Sanam Mirchandani and Baiju Kalesh, Mehra said the activity in equity capital markets is going to remain robust in the new financial year.Edited excerpts:UP election was a big game changer in many ways. Decisive mandates are always good for markets as it gives a clear direction. Investors believe that this could have a ruboff effect and have an impact even on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, which is good enough time for rolling out all economic policies by the current regime.India has a high savings rate of 31%, which in the past would go into gold real estate and fixed income. The investor interest in these three asset classes are on a decline and they want to put more money into equity.The money, which went into banks on account of demonetisation , is not being withdrawn and is being used productively adding to the investi ble pool. The flows in the mutual funds , insurance and pension schemes continue to be robust and that continues to fuel the market. In the past, FPIs were the drivers of the market and domestic investors were considered to be the followers. Now, the trend has reversed and this trend is here to stay. The Indian markets have performed very well and this is motivating a lot of individuals to come to the market in a big way, and that is why you see these IPOs getting subscribed multi-times.Emerging markets have performed well including their currencies. Among all the emerging markets, India stands out because of its macroeconomics , political stability, highquality companies and management.The interest of FPIs in India continues to be high. Last year, we saw an inflow of close to $8.5 billion. With new tax regime kicking in, we may see flows getting moderate in the near term. But on an average, we could see around $12 billion-$15 billion of FPI inflows happening very easily in India.We see a more vibrant and sustainable market, backed by strong policy measures. In FY17, around 80 deals have happened (in overall equity market) for about $7.5 billion. Bulk of the activity in capital market was harvesting by PE investors. On an average, in the last four years, PE investors put $8 billion annually in the country. This continues to be a good time for them to take some money off the table. We'd like to see some large industrial houses come forward and raise money. With the REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and InvITs (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) on the way, it will provide investors an opportunity to own paper with underlying high-quality asset.We can see it happening towards the end of FY18. For that, it is important that the first half of FY18 is played out in the right direction. If policy measures continue and there is no major disruption in the world, you should see delta in earnings kicking in by the end of the year. Going ahead, we see sector after sector being revived and they will start contributing to earnings growth. For example, last year it was oil-marketing companies, which turned around and how. This year we have witnessed strong turnaround in chemicals, sugar and metals and their handsome contributions would be visible. If the trend continues for another year, almost all sectors one by one will be out of woods.The key challenge is that larger nations are trying to become more inward looking, which could have a huge impact on other trading countries. The second risk is US policies on some of the large exporting sectors like IT, Healthcare along with the impact of rate hikes on emerging markets. The third risk is that of disintegration of EU. While Europe seems quiet now, they have their own set of problems which surface periodically along with impact of elections in Germany and France."

The situation has put authorities on their toes because ensuring the safety of the mothers and their cubs is a 24-hour job.The buffer area is the periphery of the dense core area. Tigresses move to this area to protect their cubs from strong, dominant tigers which live in the core area.

Even other tigers have been frequenting the buffer zone,"" said Dudhwa Tiger Reserve deputy director Mahaveer K.As the two tigresses accept each other's presence quietly in a close range, tiger enthusiasts and visitors believe the two are related.

Since then, the entire family has been following suit and they consider the change, an informed choice. ""We didn't want to spend on medicine and hence, changed our dietary habits. The move seems to have worked as no one in the family has fallen ill since then,"" he says. Just like Immanuel, many households in Coimbatore are gradually switching to cold-pressed oil. After millets made a comeback on Coimbatorean's menu, it's the turn of cold-pressed oil (chekku ennai) to find its way back in health-conscious Coimbatorean's life.For the last three months, homemaker Rajeswari N has been making a trip to the nearest oil mill in her locality. She opts for cold-pressed gingelly oil, groundnut oil and coconut oil. ""During my childhood, back home in my village in Theni, we used cold-pressed oil for cooking. But, after I got married and moved to Coimbatore, it became an arduous task to find chekku ennai and I switched to refined oil. It was only recently that I heard of an oil mill near our house and immediately went back to those good old days of cooking. Life has come full circle,"" says Rajeswari.According to BS Venkatachalam, proprietor of a cold-pressed oil chain in the city, ""There is an increased awareness among people today and they are extremely conscious about their health. They are now aware that many health issues can be addressed by changing one's food habits and opting for cold-pressed oil is an example. It's a misconception that oil in itself is bad for the body. Human body needs lubrication and hence, it needs oil. It's in the extraction process that we go wrong. In the days of yore, the oil was extracted in chekku made of vaagai maram and the vaagai marachekku oil (vigin cold-pressed oil) was considered extremely beneficial to one's health. Vaagai maram has the propensity to absorb heat and the hence, the oil churned out from such an oil expeller is beneficial in the long run. They would also use bulls to operate the chekku as they would move slowly. This would ensure that the same temperature is maintained throughout the extraction. The cold-pressed oil extracted with this press (oil expeller) has no LDL (bad) cholesterol. On the other hand, adulterated oil when heated extensively becomes toxic in the long run. ""K Velusamy, who runs a cold-pressed oil mill in Ganapathy, says, ""People who have been making the switch to cold-pressed oil consists of two types- those who are suffering from a health issue like joint pain or sugar; and those who want to prevent diseases. But, merely switching to cold-pressed oil will not improve one's health. One needs to cut down or stop the intake of unhealthy options like white sugar and white rice. Cold-pressed oil has a unique colour, texture and taste.""Seconding him is fitness nutritionist Almas Sajjath, ""Any product in its refined form is unhealthy - be it rice or sugar. Cold-pressed oil is a healthy alternative. In India, coconut oil is considered the best as it contains Omega 3. It has the property to cut down bad fat and keep you healthy. Cold-pressed gingelly oil (nallenai) on the other hand, has the property to keep food intact for a long time. Apart from switching to chekku ennai, one should follow a good dietary pattern that provides proper nutrition to remain healthy in the long run."" Venkatachalam adds, ""Our ancestors enjoyed good health, because they opted for healthy cooking habits. It's time we followed suit and taught our younger generations about the same."""

They realized it was actually a plastic straw. The scientists successfully dislodged the straw themselves and released the turtle back into the ocean. The team members filmed their efforts and one can see the ordeal that the turtle underwent in the online video,"" he said. ""A straw can be used only once unlike other plastics like carry bags as it is dumped after use,"" said event coordinator A Akshaya."

5909e29e7be9e033f19b881c,Will 2017 be a happy new year?,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/will-2017-be-a-happy-new-year-4453623/,2017-01-01,"After surgical strikes I have highlighted only five issues that are indicative of the health of the economy. After surgical strikes I have highlighted only five issues that are indicative of the health of the economy.We should be happy that the Indian economy, according to the government, grew at an average of 7.4 per cent (new series) in 2014-15 and 2015-16. According to the governments estimate, in the current year too, the GDP will grow at about 7.5 per cent.We should be happy that the Indian economy will be among the fastest growing large economies of the world. Currently, WPI inflation is about 3.15 per cent and CPI inflation is about 3.63 per cent. The fiscal deficit will be contained at 3.5 per cent as projected in the Budget for 2016-17. Foreign exchange reserves are at a healthy level of about USD 360 billion.Causative factorsAs 2016 draws to a close, the whole country should be celebrating the state of the economy, but there is no joy anywhere. Why are the people sullen, dejected and apprehensive about the immediate future? The proximate cause is, undoubtedly, demonetisation (about which I have written extensively), but there are deeper causes. The frowns on the faces of those in the government (and especially of those key officials who have chosen diplomatic silence!) tell a story that is very different from the boast of the fastest growing large economy. Lets look at five of the causes:1. The confidence of foreign investors has been rudely shaken. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) is a standard metric. Until October 2016, net FPI was positive at Rs 43,428 crore. In November and December, the flow reversed dramatically, and FPI outflow wasRs 66,137 crore, leaving net FPI at negative Rs 22,709 crore. The last time net FPI was negative was in 2008 when there was an unprecedented international financial crisis. If it was a flight to safety in 2008, it is a flight from uncertainty in 2016. Will the uncertainty end and the foreign investor return soon is the unresolved question before the government and the country.2. In December 2015, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) stood at 184.2. In April 2016, it was 175.5 and in October 2016, it was 178. IIP is an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector. The decline in the index speaks for itself. The worst hit is the consumer non-durables segment which is down 25 per cent. The capital goods segment is down 6 per cent. We should not be surprised if the IIP for March 2017 is lower than the IIP for April 2016, making it a rare year when industrial production actually declined during the year. Whither Make in India?Double whammy3. Credit growth is a measure of economic activity. At the end of November 2016, year on year credit growth was 6.63 per cent, a historical low, and we must go back many decades to find a lower level. Of this, non-food credit grew by 6.99 per cent. Medium-scale industries (textiles, sugar, cement, jute) is the segment where one could find regular, non-casual employment. Credit growth to medium-scale industries, year on year, has registered negative growth every month since June 2015. If we go down to the small and micro industries, the situation is worse. Currently, credit growth to small and micro industries is at (-)4.29 per cent. Demonetisation was the last straw and many of them have shut down and thrown out of employment millions of workers.4. While credit growth remains sluggish  indicating that there is little demand for investment credit  the gross NPA situation has worsened between September 2015 and September 2016 from 5.1 per cent to 9.1 per cent. It is, as the saying goes, a double whammy for the banking sector. Banks have few takers for credit and, at the same time, banks are unable to recover loans. The inescapable conclusion is that the promised revival of the industrial sector remains a promise and there are no signs of revival.5. Exports are a reliable measure of the manufacturing capabilities as well as the competitiveness of an economy. Look at the value of non-petroleum merchandise exports during the period January to November in the past few years:2012: 218.79 billion USD2013: 228.262014: 236.942015: 216.112016: 213.80While some portion of the decline can be attributed to global factors like Brexit and protectionism, the main reason is erosion of the strengths of the manufacturing sector in India. The stark truth is that when merchandise exports decline, markets are lost and jobs are axed. It is not easy to regain lost markets because some other country would have stepped in to meet the demand. Neither the Prime Minister nor the Finance Minister has rung the alarm bells about declining merchandise exports. We have not heard a serious conversation about ways and means to reverse the situation.After surgical strikes I have highlighted only five issues that are indicative of the health of the economy. It will be evident to unbiased observers that all five issues  FPI, IIP, credit growth, NPA and exports  have been adversely affected by demonetisation. So, if anything, the state of the Indian economy has become worse since the massive disruption caused by demonetisation on November 8, 2016.I cannot end this column without making a brief reference to the price that we are paying for the other surgical strike. Since the surgical strike (September 30) to end infiltrations and terrorist attacks, 33 security personnel have lost their lives in Jammu & Kashmir. As on December 25, the death toll of security personnel was 87, which is double the number of 2015. RIP, brave soldier.I wish you a Happy New Year. I sincerely wish that my wish will come true.Website: pchidambaram.in @Pchidambaram_INFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e39f7be9e033f19b888f,"Pathankot and after: Year on, many questions, few answers",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/pathankot-air-force-base-attack-and-after-year-on-many-questions-few-answers-4455019/,2017-01-02,"IMAGINE A widely scrawled W turned to face right. That is what the line on the India-Pakistan border looks like at this spot. Here is where, over the W, River Ujh enters Indian territory and exits back into Pakistan, turning off to meander further south-west to meet up with River Ravi. The sugarcane fields and the wheat crop give off a lush green lustre at this time. But, this is no rural idyll. It was through this part of the border that four terrorists from Pakistan entered India to mount an attack on the Pathankot Air Force base, exactly a year ago.Watch What Else Is Making News:A year after the attack, which claimed the lives of seven security personnel at the base and a local taxi driver whose vehicle was hijacked, and two weeks after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) filed a chargesheet in the case, locals say many questions about the infiltration still remain unanswered.According to the NIA chargesheet filed in a special court in Mohali on December 19: [The four terrorists] illegally crossed the Indo-Pak international border through the forest area near the Simbal Border Outpost. Empty food packets manufactured in Pakistan and other food articles from Pakistan were recovered from the forest area near the Simbal Border Outpost during investigation.Google Maps, used by the terrorists to spot the airbase, shows a thick patch of forest on either side of the border near Simbal. But, the locals still want to know which was the exact point of entry and how the four went undetected despite the heavy BSF presence.The BSF has maintained that wires along the border fence were intact. The only gap is on the river, which is almost dry at this time of the year. The BSF has now put up a new check post in the middle of Ujh, in addition to the existing ones on either bank. The posts guard the break in fencing on the river and are equipped with tall searchlight towers to keep a lookout.Though locals continue to believe that terrorists must have used the riverbed to enter, they ask how the BSF, with their powerful searchlights, failed to detect the entry.Sumit Singh, a panchayat member of nearby Bamiyal village, owns land just a few hundred metres from the point where Ujh enters Pakistan. He has tall sugarcane crops growing on one side of the river and last year, too, the crop was as dense as it is now with the seasonal Khooni Nullah, flowing through the fields. Originating from Jammu and Kashmir, it empties into Ujh.The search parties of the BSF and police and later, the NIA investigators were of the opinion that the terrorists may have hid in the sugarcane fields for some time, says Sumit, expressing surprise at how they went unnoticed despite the presence of two border observation posts in the area.A few hundred metres from Sumits fields and further up the Khooni Nullah lies the tubewell of Subedar Major (Retired) Narain Singh, who noticed footmarks of terrorists in front of his tubewell on January 1. They may have crossed his field before making their way into India.And the trail began from the nullah. There are also questions about how the four men reached the point on the Bamiyal Road where the chargesheet says they first hijacked an Innova taxi, belonging to Bhagwal resident Ikagarh Singh, whom they later killed. They must have had someone who helped them get to the Kathana T-point from where they hijacked the Innova, says the retired subedar major, who belonged to the Dogra Regiment.The police had also questioned members of a Gujjar settlement next to Narains field and ruled out their involvement.Kathana T-point is about 9 kms from his tubewell by road and takes around 19 minutes to reach by car via the narrow village road. Even if the terrorists were carrying heavy gear, a moderately fit person would not take more than a couple of hours to reach the place.Since the Army normally carries out its exercises in this area and also due to BSF presence, it is not uncommon to see people in camouflaged uniform and it would not raise suspicion, says Narain Singh.Echoing the same, Suresh Sharma, nambardar of Simbal village located about half-a-kilometre from the border, said, No one would question people going about in Army uniform and though the perception is that they crossed over to Bamiyal through the fields, even if they had used the road, it would not have arisen suspicion.His friend Dharampal Sharma says it is a general perception that the terrorists crossed over from this part of the border. Who can say it for sure? But then there has to be some involvement of people this side of the border, too, for them to reach so deep inside.The wide open fields are interspersed with bunkers and pill boxes built as defensive installations for the Army which remain unoccupied for most part of the year. At some places near Bamiyal, Simbal and Khojki Chak villages, these pill boxes are right next to the road and if someone were to occupy them, they would not be noticed even in daylight.The T-point where Ikagar Singh was hijacked is barely one-and-a-half kilometres from where his body was eventually found just before the Kathlor bridge over River Ravi. The then Gurdaspur SP, Salwinder Singh, was also stopped at this very point by the terrorists.The route from Simbal to Kathlor bridge now has three checkposts in addition to the one right on the bridge. This post was passed by the terrorists in SP Salwinder Singhs SUV without being intercepted but now every vehicle coming from the border is being checked.However, even now, there is not much checking at other checkposts leading to the border villages. Though policemen are deployed there, vehicles pass through unchecked. The border is also not sparsely populated and there is a village or some houses at every short distance from the point where the terrorists entered India to the point where they hijacked vehicles.A year after the attack, many residents of this sensitive border area feel that the circumstances under which the terrorists entered India and managed to reach Pathankot are still not clear despite the probe carried out by the NIA.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

This year, 32 mills have not commenced crushing due to paucity of cane, among other issues.In anticipation of increased cane area for 2017-18, the state government plans to take steps to restart the sugar mills that have ceased operations. State Cooperation Minister Subhash Deshmukh announced the decision, adding that the government will extend all necessary help to speed up the process.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeshmukh, speaking to The Indian Express, said the decision was taken to avoid collection of unharvested cane in the fields. Due to the drought last year, cane area across Maharashtra had seen a sharp dip with only 6.33 lakh hectares of farm land reporting cultivation. Good monsoons and successful water retention schemes under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan in various parts of the state will see an increase in cane area for the crushing season of 2017-18. It is expected that the cane area for the next season will be around 10 lakh hectare and a bumper crop of cane is expected.It has been observed that in many cases, due to shortage of mills, cane remains unharvested. To avoid this, non-operational mills in those areas will be restarted, he said, adding that a preliminary survey to identify such mills has already started.The state will explore all possible means to help interested parties in running the mills. We are drawing up a detailed plan and will seek bidders for the mills, he said. The state government is ready to bear the working capital, if needed. Defunct mills in Marathwada, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Pune districts are being checked for the purpose.This year, 32 mills have not commenced crushing due to paucity of cane, among other issues.The governments decision comes at a time when the sugar sector in the state is reeling under cumulative effect of low prices and under-utilisation of their capacities. Several mills fear that their accounts with various banks will be deemed as a Non-performing asset (NPA) and it would be difficult to start operations next year. Estimates by the millers show that about 60 per cent of the mills might not be able to start operations.A delegation of the millers, led by former Union Minister Sharad Pawar, had met Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely on Tuesday to press for the restructuring of repayment of various loans levied on them. Deshmukh said the chief minister is likely to meet the finance minister to discuss the matter.As of December 31, 82 per cent of fair and remunerative price (FRP) have been paid in the state. Around 100 of the 147 mills have in fact defaulted in their payment and officers of the sugar commissionerate are taking steps to increase the amount.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The foot-march was spearheaded by general secretary of KSG Sagar Rabari.In its memorandum, the organisation made 25 demands before the Chief Minister, seeking to redress the issues at the earliest.One of the major demands raised by the farmers body was to waive off all loans to farmers and declare a date for disbursal of 100 per cent amount of crop insurance. It has also demanded that each farmer should get Rs 50,000 financial aid per acre.Other demands of KSG included announcement of an Agriculture Policy, 100 per cent increase in the minimum support prices of crops, cancellation of all changes made to the Gujarat Agriculture Land Ceiling Act and law for land acquisition, immediate stopping of land acquisitions related to Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and related projects, a white paper on the status of Kalpsar project, re-commanding all de-commanded areas from various irrigation projects including Narmada, no land acquisition for polluting industries, 24-hour power for farmers and waiving the tax being levied on the sale of sugarcane.The farmers also demanded that since vegetable farmers and horticulturists have faced a lot loss owing to the demonetisation decision of the Centre, a neutral team be formed to assess their loss and accordingly a package be announced for them. They have also demanded the government to make provision so that the village gauchar land was not given for any purpose.Speaking with The Indian Express, Rabari said, In last five years due to natural calamities, scarce rain and lower price-band of agriculture produce, agriculture sector in Gujarat is on the verge of collapse. In India, Gujarat comes 12th in terms of per hectare food production and the major reason for it is lack of irrigation facilities.We carried the foot march and have been given an assurance that a meeting with the Chief Minister will be fixed in some days. If, we do not get a sincere redressal of farmers issues then will give a call to farmers across the state not to vote for BJP in the Assembly elections, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

She and her cousins live on the same street near Sugar Land, southwest of Houston.Mayor Joe Zimmerman was swift to condemn the incident, saying, ""prejudice of any kind is unacceptable.""""We still have racism in Houston and we still have people who hate Muslims in Houston,"" Mustafaa Carroll, executive director for the local chapter of the Council on American- Islamic Relations, was quoted as saying.Recounting the incident, Abuzaid said she was the eldest of her family members present at the time. The youngest was 10 years old. She was in front as they walked to the car and was the only one with a hijab.When they passed the couple, she said she tried to appear friendly. But the younger kids in her family stopped in their tracks after the ""terrorists"" remark, she said. They told Abuzaid what they had heard the man say. She felt shocked -- then she decided to try to talk to him about it.She followed the man into a store, Abuzaid said, and asked him politely why he had called them terrorists. She found his reaction confrontational.Her sister began to cry as the man got close to her face, and when her 15-year-old brother stepped in front of her, the man pushed him, according to Abuzaid.The man then began to deny their account, Abuzaid said. A manager at the store stepped in to help. The store had called security, and the man and woman left.A police officer later told Abuzaid he could not do anything because no one was physically harmed, she said.Later, Sugar Land Police Chief Douglas Brinkley said he believed the officer was told no one had been injured but that police planned to look again at it.The incident comes amid a series of such cases of intimidation and assault that have been reported across the country against hijab-clad women following Trump's win.Last month, a Hijab-clad Muslim student was allegedly struck in the face with a glass bottle in broad daylight at the University of Washington campus in Seattle."

Yay! Woohoo!Another chance to try and improve ourselves, or do more of what we did for the last 12 months and pretend like were trying to improve ourselves.This year I sent out and replied to very few wishes, resisted the urge to share a photograph of the flowering gourd vine on my balcony with a caption of new beginnings and went about the day like it was any other Sunday. Then the children ruined it by insisting we make new year resolutions. The five-year-old decided that in 2017 he would make an entire Lego set himself, instead of imperiously tossing the instruction manual to his underlings (his brother and myself), yell at us to work faster and then snatch the final creation from our hands and crow, Look what I made! The eight-year-old solemnly stated that he would like to read more books, read one book and then claimed Im done!I decided to be myself more and be in the moment more. Now, the reason I chose this was because a) Im perfect b) its hard to quantify being in the moment: no kilograms lost, minutes exercised, pages read, steps walked to track c) No one can really tell if Im in the moment or not.Also, with this resolution I basically have to do nothing. I find this gentler than some of the resolutions my fellow parents make. Ill be nicer to my kids, I wont shout at them, Ill be more understanding, Ill be patient. Yeah. Sure you will (written with a massive teenage eye roll). Forget about the standard 15 days our best intentions are predicted to last in the new year these resolutions dont even last 15 minutes. Hypothetically, all it would take is someone (say age five) to open a dabba of gulab jamuns, proceed to spill sugar syrup all over the kitchen floor, panic, run through it, and then through the entire house looking for a place to hide. I mean, one could look at the sticky, sweet mess, smile and say Aww thats alright. We all make mistakes sweetheart or one could scream Get your skinny butt back here right now and clean this before I make you lick it off the floor.In such a hypothetical situation, my new year resolution insists that I chose option 2. Because a)Im being myself and b) Im truly being in the moment. (How can one tell? One cannot! That is the beauty of it.) c) It feels so good.Parents, were getting the blame whatever we do. Failed parenting techniques is one of the reasons Simon Sinek says millennials are so hard to work with. Some people are calling Aamir Khans portrayal of Mahavir Singh Phogat in Dangal (2016) abusive parenting masquerading as nationalism. If you tell your kids how amazing they are and tell them they can have anything they want youre crippling them. If youre tough, wake them up at 5am and cut their hair off, people will write s*** about you. Sure, sure theres a middle path were meant to find and tread. But till you find it (or someone else finds it for you), follow my lead and be yourselves! And help yourself to a gulab jamun. Or three.(The writers parenting philosophy is: if theres no blood, dont call me)"

Over the years, the cultivation of the water-guzzling crop has come down from 7,000 hectares (ha) to less than 2,000 ha. It is now on the verge of extinction.After closure of the sugar mill, Nayagarh Sugar Complex, in 2014, the farmers of the district have almost stopped the cultivation of sugarcane and switched over to other cash crops. Sources said in order to boost sugarcane cultivation, a sugar factory was established at Panipoila here when J B Patnaik was the CM in 1987.Hundreds of farmers were registered as shareholders and also benefited. As the Cooperation department failed to run it profitably, Nayagarh Sugar Complex was sold for a measly Rs 5.22 crore to a private party in 2004.After running successfully for a few years, the mill faced labour problems and the company officials were forced to shut it down in 2014. A farmer leader said now cane is being cultivated only in Sajanapada, Champatipur and Butadi under Nayagarh block and Bodasha and Anlamada in Khandapada block. Farmers in Kantabania village, who were making a fast buck from sugarcane crop, have migrated to other States for their livelihood, he added.Sources said the climate and soil of Nayagarh being conducive to sugarcane crop, farmers used to cultivate it in large tracts of land and prepare jaggery from it in traditional method. Traders from different parts of the State and outside flocked to Nayagarh to take truckloads of gur and molasses in earthen pots. Sugarcane in Nayagarh has more sucrose (sweetness) percentage than those from Uttar Pradesh, experts say."

The manifesto released here by BJP president Amit Shah promised to waive crop loans of small and marginal farmers, besides providing them loans at a lower rate of interest.Apparently keeping in mind the anger of sugar cane farmers in western and central regions, Shah said his party would ensure clearance of the arrears due to them from sugar mills within a fortnight of assuming power. The manifesto also promised 100% paddy purchase by the government and power to farmers at cheaper rates.Shah said a BJP government in the state would provide free LPG cylinders to the poor, free education to girls up to graduation and laptops with free 1 GB data to youths. There will be free WiFi in school and college campuses, he said. Claiming that the law and order situation had turned from bad to worse during the successive Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party regimes, Shah said that for effective policing, the BJP, if voted to power, would recruit 1.5 lakh police constables from every section of society.He also promised to shut down illegal slaughter houses in the state and prevent exodus of people from their villages due to communal tension. It is a fact that people have left their villages in large numbers owing to communal tension, Shah added. Keeping in view the demands for separate Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal, Shah said his party, if it came to power, would set up Poorvanchal Vikas Board and Bundelkhand Vikas Board to ensure development of the two backward regions. Shah also said his party would seek the opinion of Muslim women on triple talaq. The BJP president promised to set up six super speciality hospitals on the lines of AIIMS in different parts of the state."

5922bce57be9e01fd59ab99c,March heat may dampen govt’s hopes of record wheat crop,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/march-heat-may-dampen-govts-hopes-of-record-wheat-crop-4597025/,2017-04-02,"Temperatures in this area touched 38 degrees on March 28 and crossed 40 degrees  nearly six degrees above normal  by the month-end. Temperatures in this area touched 38 degrees on March 28 and crossed 40 degrees  nearly six degrees above normal  by the month-end.THE SUDDEN spike in temperatures since early last week is stoking concerns over the standing wheat crop, even as the Centre has projected a record production of 96.64 million tonnes (mt) and recently levied a 10 per cent import duty on the grain.It was looking good till around March 20. Even on March 25, when the maximum temperature rose to 36 degrees Celsius, I was confident my crop will be similar, if not better, than the one in 2013. The baali (wheat ear heads) had formed beautifully and there were enough ghundi (grain-bearing spikelets) in each of them. But the last week has changed the picture, says Pritam Singh Hanjra, who has planted wheat on 82 of his 90-acre holding at Urlana Khurd village in Madlauda tehsil of Haryanas Panipat.Temperatures in this area touched 38 degrees on March 28 and crossed 40 degrees  nearly six degrees above normal  by the month-end. This is the time when the grain is getting filled. The present heat wave could affect the size and weight, even if not the number, of grains harvested from each baali, says Hanjra.Wheat is mostly a 140 to 150-day crop. The crop thats sown before around November 20 is harvested by April 15. Flowering starts in about 90 days, when the ear heads have fully emerged along with anthers containing pollen. The complete flowering and pollination process  wheat flowers are self-fertilised by the movement of pollen from the male (stamen) to the female (stigma) part of the same flower  happens within five days near February 20.The subsequent 45 days or more is when the resultant grain develops, from the early milk and dough to the final hardening and ripening stages of the kernel. The real grain-filling, or accumulation of semi-solid starch matter in kernels, takes place roughly from mid-March. During this phase, day temperatures should ideally not exceed 35 degrees. When they cross that level, the grain tends to ripen.The question being asked is whether, and to what extent, would the abrupt rise in the mercury this time cause premature ripening. This is important, given the general thumb rule that every extra day on the field during the grain-filling stage gives an extra wheat yield of 45-50 kg per hectare.For the last one week, temperatures are what they should have been closer to April 10. Normally, we dont give any irrigation after March 15, but are now doing so every other day to keep the temperature around the crop down, says Raghbir Singh, a nine-acre farmer from Randhawa Masanda village of Jalandhar in Punjab.I am worried, as my wheat was sown in early December after the harvesting of sugarcane. The crop is still green and grain-filling had started just around the time of this heat wave. Irrigation can help provide moisture and prevent sudden drying, but cannot replace the natural process of the grain ripening with the gradual setting in of summer, says Rattan Singh, who farms 10 acres at Sherpur village in Hoshiarpurs Mukerian tehsil.Sahaj pake, so meetha hoye (When something is cooked slowly, it tastes sweeter). Even if the crop matures a week early, it will translate into a yield loss of 1.5 quintals per acre. Last year, I harvested an average yield of 24 quintals per acre. This time, till March 25, I was hopeful of 26 quintals because the tillering, baali formation and even early grain development were so good. But now, yields could be 22.5 quintals or even less, says Hanjra in Panipat.However, Rajbir Yadav, principal scientist and wheat breeder at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute at New Delhi, believes that production losses due to the early onset of summer may not be much. There could be some impact for the crop sown late. But farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka would already have harvested their wheat by the time temperatures had soared. Even in Punjab and Haryana, the crop planted before November 20 would have reached near-physiological maturity before March-end. There is no further grain-filling after that, only a reduction in its moisture content from about 17 per cent to 10-11 per cent, he says.On February 15, the Agriculture Ministry had estimated Indias wheat production for 2016-17 at 96.64 mt, surpassing the previous all-time high of 95.85 mt in 2013-14. The expectation of a bumper harvest also led to the wheat import duty being raised to 10 per cent, from zero, on March 28.Whether the latest unforeseen sunstroke will prompt a review  more so, with public wheat stocks of 9.43 mt as on March 1 at a nine-year-low  remains to be seen.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

""That calmed me down a lot.""Ames won the Mitsubishi Electric Classic on Sunday for his first PGA Tour Champions title, easily holding off Bernhard Langer at TPC Sugarloaf.The 52-year-old Ames, a naturalized Canadian citizen from Trinidad, closed with a 6-under 66 for a four-stroke victory over Langer. Ames opened with rounds of 67 and 68 to take a one-stroke lead over five players into the final round.Making his 49th senior start, Ames had six birdies in his bogey-free round to finish at 15-under 201. He won for the first time since taking the 2009 Children's Miracle Network Classic for the last of his four PGA Tour titles.""I felt very much in control of my tempo and everything else,"" Ames said. ""It was nice to be in that situation and play the way I did today.""Ames is the third Canadian to win on the 50-and-over tour and the 11th player to win on the PGA Tour Champions, PGA Tour and Web.com Tour.Langer, a 30-time winner on the tour, had a 65 to jump from a tie for 21st. Fred Funk (66), David Frost (68) and Brandt Jobe (70) tied for third at 10 under, and 2016 winner Woody Austin (68) and Kevin Sutherland (71) followed at 9 under.Langer's tour-record streak of par or better rounds at 36 ended Saturday with a 73.""It was a sad way to finish yesterday, especially bogeying 18 was bad,"" Langer said. ""But I didn't think I hit a bad tee shot and ended up with a horrible lie. I couldn't even extract it out of the rough and ended up making 6, so that was pretty poor. I just never made a putt yesterday.""Ames did himself an early favor to create some breathing room, chipping in on the par-4 seventh. It was his second straight birdie and fourth on the front nine.""I read the line like a putt,"" he said. ""I picked my spot where I wanted to land it. When I hit the ball and it came off the face, I was like, `Ooh, this felt good.' It landed on my spot and the ball went to the hole like a putt. It was perfectly executed.""When Langer closed within two strokes, Ames locked back into his mantra of staying calm. Nobody has dominated the PGA Tour Champions in recent years like Langer, so Ames knew his lead wasn't safe just yet.""Oh, I was watching,"" Ames said. ""Don't worry. I'm a leaderboard-watcher.""Ames calculated how many holes Langer had left and how many birdies he needed to take the lead. When Langer made par on the last three holes, Ames felt some relief.""I had to keep an eye on him,"" Ames said. ""When I saw that he finished at 11 (under), I realized that I could actually put this in cruise control coming in, which is what I did."""

Fifty trucks queue up at each borewell at any time of the day and, as Krishna, driver of a 6,000 litre truck, says, We start at 4 in the morning and go on till 10.Water is delivered to Kamudhi, Kadaladi and Mudukulathur. They pay borewell owner Rs 100 per load and sell at Rs 3-10 a pot, depending upon distance. Each load of 6,000 litres fills about 320 pots and at two trips a day per truck, business is blooming in this desert.Visila, a resident of Mandalamanickam, said she buys two to four pots for her family of four everyday at Rs 5 a pot. Kannirajapuram is another water business hub. Though the wells here have almost dried up, tanker owners are determined to keep at it. Said driver Serin Raj: You see this truck here? It has been drawing water since 8.30 in the morning and is not full yet. It was past three in the afternoon.Many private trucks also deliver water to the 2500-acre solar power project at Kamuthi, said to be the second-largest in the world. Water is needed to wash away dust that accumulates on solar panels.In this aridscape of Ramanathapuram, a festival is when a pipeline springs a leak. Like ants to sugar, villagers gather to make the most of it, exchanging gossip and smiling at their good fortune. Today, at this leak point in Thirupullani, the topic is how the farmer whose fields adjacent to the damaged pipeline harvested two crops of paddy entirely with this spring. Indeed, the paddies in the field seemed chancy and happy.There is a code of Omerta about the lucky leaks. The women dont want the leak fixed. Dont take pictures here, 37-year-old Kala warned me. The last time one of you lot took a picture, they closed the leak."

The district registered highest rainfall of 1,140 mm last year, besides having two major and a few minor rivers. Still, the farm productivity was comparatively low when compared to other district, he observed.Despite receiving not more than 450 mm rain per annum, the farm productivity in Anantapur was more than that of Srikakulam.In the next two years, the district must be equal as the twin Godavari districts in paddy production, he said.Speaking on sugarcane harvest, he said the productivity in the district was not even 50 per cent than that of Nellore.It is high time, the agriculture and allied departments worked in unison and each department must come up with a plan of action for the next cropping season, he said.Expressing his displeasure over the farm ponds and bore wells, he recalled that the authorities had dug up 72 bore wells against the target of 1,500, under the NTR Jalasiri scheme last season, while only 3,623 farm ponds were grounded against the 1,500 applications received. He asked the officials to mobilise farmers to dig up 3,500 bore wells by the June-end.Assuring the authorities of fund allocation, he said that he would negotiate the higher-ups to release not less than Rs 25 crore for farm mechanisation.Though the officials were confined to Rs 1,130 crore in the form of crop loans, he said that the target should not be less than Rs 2,500 crore for the coming kharif."

Before ordering the probe, he said loot and misuse of public money would not be tolerated.Former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had laid the foundation for a museum in the Hussainabad area and inaugurated the redevelopment of the area on December 4 last year. Last October 11, Akhilesh had opened the Jai Prakash Narayan International Centre, which is supposed to have a museum, guest house, an aquatic block with international-level swimming and diving pools, a convention centre and a sports complex. Construction is on.Speaking to The Indian Express, Pasi said, Public money of hundreds of crores has been spent on these projects. In the next couple of days, I will inspect the sites of both the projects along with technical experts to probe the expenditure of public money, quality of construction and utility of the work done there.When asked about the possibility of action against former ministers and senior officers, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said action would be taken against the guilty irrespective of their caste, religion, party and position.While reviewing the work of the urban development department, Adityanath expressed dissatisfaction on the quality of the infrastructure development work done under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

Names of senior political leaders of all parties, including Ajit Pawar, Manikrao Thakre, Pandurang Fundkar and Vijay Wadettiwar, have appeared in the case as they were directors of the bank when financial irregularities took place.State Co-operative Minister Subhash Deshmukh, who made the announcement in the Assembly, said, The report regarding the ongoing investigation is ready and it is over 3,500 pages, but the probe is taking time as 2,000 cases need to be investigated. The issue was discussed during question hour.Ruling party MLAs had raised questions about the investigation into the high profile scam, which is yet to be completed after two years. MLAs were not satisfied by the Ministers reply and demanded that the probe be speeded up.Mr. Deshmukh assured the House that the investigation would be completed within a year, and action would be taken against those responsible. The government will appoint a retired judge of the High Court to investigate the matter independently. We will ask him to complete investigation within six months, he said.Senior BJP member Anil Gote objected to the Ministers reply. The House was assured in December 2015 by Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil that the investigation would be completed by May 22, 2016. But even in 2017, the government is seeking one more year to complete the probe. It creates a picture that the government is supporting the corrupt boards. Mr. Deshmukh, however, rejected the charge, saying no one would be spared if found guilty.Financial irregularities in the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank had rocked State politics in 2011, when the then Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan had ordered that the banks directorial board be scrapped. The Nationalist Congress Party, which was then an ally in Mr. Chavans Congress in the government, had control over bank for decades.The banks condition deteriorated after 1998-99, with loans begin given to sugar mills, weaving mills and others with political intentions. The increase in the number of directors and their expenses had also became a serious issue. Roles NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Vijaysinh Mohite Patil, BJP leader Pandurang Fundkar, Congress leaders Manikrao Thakre and Vijay Vadettivar, and many others are being investigated."

Why is it that my cough worsens when temperature rises? I constantly wrap a muffler around my neck despite of the heat.One of the reasons why a person suffers from cough in summers and rising temperature is because of either dryness in the throat or seasonal allergy which coincides with the season. While regular medications are prescribed to patients, there are cases where a person cannot be comfortable using the same. In such cases patients must visit their physician and get their throat checked.I have heard honey is good for throat and cough. Is it advisable to have honey instead of a cough syrup?Honey may not be a good replacement for cough syrup always. It makes a person feel comfortable only in case of dry throat. But honey cannot replace medication as the syrup is a scientific solution to heal dry cough. In case the patient is diabetic, consuming honey could be dangerous for his health. For such cases, they can opt for sugar free versions of the cough syrup available in market.Every time I clean my ears, I get a pungent smell of water leaking. I experienced a piercing pain also. What can it be and how can I stop it? I am 55-year-old female.First of all, you must remember that cleaning your ear on regular basis is not mandatory. It is essentially done for self-cleansing. However, if you get a pungent smelling discharge or piercing pain, it is an indication of an ear infection. It is advisable to visit an ENT doctor who could examine your ear and prescribe proper medication.I have a constant throat itch, I attempt to clear it frequently. I was ok until I spotted blood in my recent attempt to clear it. What could it be ?In the process of constantly clearing the throat to get rid of itching, you would have damaged your tissues in your throat. This could be a reason for spotting blood in mucous. One should refrain from this practice to avoid the damage to the throat.The expert is Consultant ENT Surgeon from Fortis Hospital,Bannerghatta Road.For health related queries write to health.cityexpress@gmail.com"

The PM is on a visit to his home-state.Sagar Rabari, a farmers' rights activist and the secretary of Gujarat Khedut Samaj , said that the income tax department has sent recovery notices to some of the largest sugar cooperative clusters of South Gujarat. The notices suggest that 14 cooperatives evaded Rs 1,399 crore in taxes between 2011-12 and 2013-14.Rabari said that the I-T department has overlooked the fact that agricultural incomes are exempt from tax under the I-T Act. According to the notices, the I-T department has considered sugar cooperatives to be industrial firms.A memorandum of demands of these cooperatives which the farmers want to hand to the PM says: ""The farmers in South Gujarat depend mainly on sugarcane farming. When farmers in other parts of the country are not getting their wages, the sugar industry of Gujarat is running with vibrancy."" The memorandum goes on to say: ""But the I-T department has misinterpreted wages paid to farmers as profits earned by the sugar cooperatives and the department has started slapping recovery notices."" The I-T department is not ready to understand the concept of cooperative sector and interests of farmers, the memorandum says.The sugar cooperatives which received notices are Bardoli (for Rs 267 crore recovery), Gandevi (Rs 170 crore), Madhi (Rs 112 crore), Chalthan (Rs 116 crore), Maroli (Rs 36 crore), Valsad (Rs 31 crore), Sayan (Rs 146 crore), Mahuva (Rs 31 crore), Ganesh (Rs 41 crore), Kamrej (Rs 54 crore), Kopar (Rs 30 crore), Pandvai (Rs 164 crore), Narmada (Rs 182 crore), and Vadodara (Rs 141 crore).Rabari said that farmers' key representative, Jayesh Patel, was detained by police in Surat before could make the representation to the PM."

He took the extreme step due to mounting debts.Debts drove another farmer to attempt suicide by consuming poison in front of housing minister M Krishnappa at a public function in Mandya on Saturday. He wanted to take his life as he had not received compensation for the land he had given up for developing an irrigation canal.In the first instance, Marigowda (62), had cultivated paddy, sugarcane and ragi in two acres of land and had borrowed Rs 4 lakh from fellow villagers. He had raised Rs 75,000 as gold loan from a nationalised bank and had borrowed another Rs 4.5 lakh from private lenders. But with no rains and the irrigation canals bone dry, his crops failed, forcing him to end his life.Marigowda is survived by wife his and two sons. Maddur police have registered a case.Appaji Gowda, also a sexagerian hailing from the same taluk as Marigowda, said that suicide was the only option left for him after he ran pillar to post at various government offices for six months, but was still unable to get the due compensation. Gowda, a native of Ankanapura, said that he was deep in debt and money lenders had demanded repayment of money on more than five occasions.The minister was taking part in Basava jayanthi celebrations in Kalamandir auditorium. As Gowda was going to submit a representation on this to the minister, he collapsed. He was rushed to a hospital and is said to be out of danger.Krishnappa directed authorities to attend to the farmers plea and release compensation immediately.Mandya district has already witnessed the deaths of seven debt-ridden farmers in the last one month.A few weeks ago, JD(S) state president H D Kumaraswamy had visited the family of a dead farmer in the district and handed over compensation of `1 lakh to the family.The irrigation department had stopped releasing water for agricultural purposes in November to ensure there is no scarcity of drinking water in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya and other places in summer. This has affected 80 per cent of farmers in Mandya district who depend on water from KRS for irrigation. Besides, many borewells in the district have gone dry."

The market expects global sugar production to recover, so funds have been liquidating long positions.Mills that hedged at the peak of sugar prices last year are booking large profits liquidating those positions now, even though they will be exposed to new price fluctuations going forward, the sources said, seeking anonymity since they are not allowed to talk about the trades publicly.""This is happening particularly with mills that need to generate cash to start harvest works,"" said one source.Brazil's top cane belt is starting to crush a new crop, with works expected to last through November.Larger, more structured sugar groups, which represent the largest amounts of sugar to be exported by Brazil this year, are not liquidating their futures contracts, and will probably maintain their hedging, the second source said.The first source said a mid-sized mill in Sao Paulo state who had hedged 110,000 tonnes of sugar in New York is liquidating that position and pocketing profits because it had a very high average price in the position, much above current values.According to Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting, 52 percent of Brazil's 2017/18 exportable sugar volume has already been hedged in New York's ICE at an average price of 17.7 cents per pound.

Fifty trucks queue up at each borewell at any time of the day and, as Krishna, driver of a 6,000 litre truck, says, We start at 4 in the morning and go on till 10.Water is delivered to Kamudhi, Kadaladi and Mudukulathur. They pay borewell owner Rs 100 per load and sell at Rs 3-10 a pot, depending upon distance. Each load of 6,000 litres fills about 320 pots and at two trips a day per truck, business is blooming in this desert.Visila, a resident of Mandalamanickam, said she buys two to four pots for her family of four everyday at Rs 5 a pot.Kannirajapuram is another water business hub. Though the wells here have almost dried up, tanker owners are determined to keep at it.Said driver Serin Raj: You see this truck here? It has been drawing water since 8.30 in the morning and is not full yet. It was past three in the afternoon.Many private trucks also deliver water to the 2500-acre solar power project at Kamuthi, said to be the second-largest in the world. Water is needed to wash away dust that accumulates on solar panels.In this aridscape of Ramanathapuram, a festival is when a pipeline springs a leak.

Incidentally, strengthening Yeshasvini was one of the promises made by the Congress in its manifesto during the 2013 Assembly elections.Cashless treatmentThe scheme covers 823 defined surgical procedures and enables members to avail themselves of cashless treatment up to Rs. 2 lakh per family member for a minimal annual contribution of Rs. 300 per member in rural areas and up to Rs. 2.5 lakh per family member for a minimal annual contribution of Rs. 710 per member in urban areas.Kodihalli Chandrashekar, president of the Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha, said he would write to the Chief Minister urging him to withdraw the decision.

Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and a member of Yeshasvini Trust, said the scheme, jointly funded by farmers and the government, covers only secondary care procedures and subsidised out-patient services. The other schemes cover tertiary care procedures. The premium is deducted while disbursing loans or making payments to the farmers so that the farmers do not drop out. It is functioning effectively and enrolment will become difficult if the scheme is brought under the Health Department, he said.However, Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, argued that the scheme would not lose its identity and the idea of bringing it under the departments fold was only for better coordination and administrative purposes.It is for integrating various healthcare schemes so that there is a single system of managing data and health records which will also take care of duplication of services. Last time we took over RSBY from the Labour Department and we are now working on Yeshasvini, she said. She said as of now, the enrolment of members will continue to be through cooperative societies."

But it is not immediately known if it received the data from all affiliated schools.Among the diabetic population of our country, there is a sizeable number of children suffering from type 1 diabetes who need insulin injections at regular intervals to manage their blood glucose level.These children need frequent meals to avoid hypoglycaemia which may otherwise affect their health/performance, Choudhury said.Taking this into consideration, the board decided to allow eatables in examination halls, he added."

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in six American children are overweight or obese.The Agriculture Department said the nutritional requirements imposed on schools in the past five years had added $1.2 billion in costs to school districts and to states.It said easing those rules would decrease costs, give back greater control to local authorities, and see children eating more enthusiastically.""If kids aren't eating the food, and it's ending up in the trash, they aren't getting any nutrition - thus undermining the intent of the program,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.At the same time, the Trump administration discontinued another signature program by Michelle Obama and her husband Barack Obama.The 2015 scheme designed to promote educational opportunities for adolescent girls in developing countries, called ""Let Girls Learn,"" was being immediately scrapped, CNN reported on the basis of an internal email it had obtained.The email, sent to members of the US Peace Corps, a US government overseas volunteer program, said some parts of ""Let Girls Learn"" would continue, but the name was being dropped along with its standalone status."

Related to ginger, turmeric is a kitchen spice in use for food and medicine for ages.The banal life in urban pockets doesnt allow many of us to see the amazing stages in which a farm crop originates and evolves before reaching the kitchen space. Farm workers in Iluru village under Thotlavalluru mandal in Krishna district on Wednesday were seen processing turmeric rhizomes with deep orange flesh which are dried and then ground to make the familiar vibrant yellow powder.A.P. is the major producerAndhra Pradesh is the leading state in producing turmeric followed by Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Kerala and Bihar.The humble journey of this fine yellow power begins in the fields where well developed or split mother rhizomes are used for planting and treated before storing. The crop needs to be mulched immediately with green leaves or sugarcane trash. Depending on the variety, the crop is ready for harvest in seven to nine months. The land is ploughed and the rhizomes are gathered by hand picking or the clumps are carefully lifted with a spade, says Barma Venkata Subbarao, an agriculture worker engrossed in the task at Iluru.Harvested rhizomes are cleaned of mud and cured before marketing, chips in Zareena Sultana, another farm worker, assisting Mr. Subba Rao.Curing involves boiling of fresh rhizomes in water and drying them in the sun. In the traditional method, the cleaned rhizomes are boiled in copper or galvanised iron or earthen vessels, with water just enough to soak them, he says, pointing to the froth coming out of the white fumes giving out a typical odour. Boiling should be stopped at this point, he explains.Removing four big containers filled with semi-boiled turmeric rhizomes from the fire, Mr. Subba Rao calls out on others for help. Half-a-dozen workers lend him a helping hand in carrying the containers to one side, unloading the rhizomes in heaps and spreading them evenly for drying.The next 10-15 days, the rhizomes are allowed to dry before their appearance is improved by polishing the outer surface.Earlier it was done manually but now it is through mechanical rubbing, he says. Last year, the farm workers say, the crop fetched Rs. 8,000 per quintal. Now it fetches anything between Rs. 4,500 and Rs. 5,000 per quintal. The rates may improve, you never know. Because traders create artificial scarcity in the market sometimes, he says with a fond hope."

The management committee will move to court against the government decision.Meanwhile, the High Court has accepted a petition of the Adattu Farmers Cooperative Bank management committee challenging the government order.A team of doctors, led by District Medical Officer Baby Lakshmi, had been monitoring the MLAs health since Monday as his health condition had deteriorated with low sugar and sodium levels. The medical team advised to shift him to hospital as his blood pressure too showed fluctuations. On the directive of the District Collector, a police team arrested the MLA and forcibly shifted him to hospital.Order to suspendMr. Akkara began his hunger strike soon after the government decision on suspending the Adattu bank came seven days ago. Though many senior Congress leaders, including Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, urged him to end the hunger strike, he refused to budge from his decision. KPCC president M.M. Hassan had called on Mr. Akkara before he was shifted to hospital.Congress Working Committee member A.K. Antony had earlier called on the MLA and urged him to end the strike. But he refused to end the agitation without the government withdrawing the anti-constitutional decision to suspend the management committee.My agitation is not to attack the Pinarayi government.

Schools also ended the sale of junk food, including carbonated drinks, in vending machines and tuck shops."

""I'm being targetted under a conspiracy so that I stop speaking on EVM tampering by the BJP...but I'm not going to withdraw from this fight to save democracy,"" she said at an Ambedkar anniversary function of her party here.""Our party will continue to fight against the tampering of EVMs by the BJP. For this BSP now has no reservations in taking the help of anti-BJP parties in its fight against EVM tampering and the BJP as it is the democracy which comes first...we have to keep democracy alive,"" she said. ""It is in the interest of the party that EVM tampering is checked at the earliest for which we are ready to use venom against venom,"" she said.""The BJP gained power in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections by tampering EVMs...but we realised this only in the recent elections,"" she said, adding that EVMs were tampered with in some 250 seats of 403 in the state. ""On other seats they thought they will win anyway,"" she said. The BSP chief who had announced that her party will hold protests on every 11th of the month on the issue said this programme has been put on hold as the matter is now in the apex court.Addressing the first programme of her party after a dismal show in the recent Assembly elections, Mayawati, in a major announcement, also appointed her younger brother Anand Kumar as the party's vice president. ""I have decided to give important responsibility to my brother Anand Kumar, that of party's national vice president, with the condition that he will work selflessly and never become an MP, MLA, minister or chief minister,"" she said.Elaborating on the reasons for giving her brother this responsibility, Mayawati said as she has to spend maximum time in Lucknow she needed someone in Delhi for sharing her burden. ""I had to rush to Delhi every four to five days for signing papers but since our party constitution provides for same signing rights to the vice president, it will save party's money,"" she said.Stressing that her brother will continue to do his business as before so that he is not dependent on anyone financially, she also allowed him to bring any other member of the family, having a missionary zeal, in the party fold. Speaking for the first time before party workers on her medical condition which she said has forced her not to speak loudly. She said she has instead been advised to read written texts by doctors.""One of the two glands on the throat was removed by doctors in an operation and so I cannot stress my throat too much,"" Mayawati said she has to work very hard in first writing and then reading it whereas it is easy to speak extempore. The BSP chief has been under fire following a recent decision of the Yogi Adityanath government to order a probe into sale of sugar mills and construction of memorials under her government.""It is being projected as if I'm responsible whereas I have never held either of the departments...the sugar department was headed by Naseemuddin but he did not take the decision to sell it, it was taken by the Cabinet,"" she said. Yogi Adityanath has ordered an inquiry into the Mayawati- led BSP government's decision to sell 21 state sugar mills for a song in 2010-2011.""A thorough inquiry should be conducted into the Rs 1,100 crore scam. If necessary, the state government would also recommend a CBI inquiry into the issue,"" the chief minister had said when presentations about sugarcane development department were made before him last week.Mayawati also charged the BJP with harassing and maligning her close relatives and herself. ""Since the past several years, me and my close relatives have had to bear a lot...The BJP and company have been misusing official machinery since 2014 in harassing my brother through income tax, the CBI and the enforcement directorate and trying to tarnish his image,"" she alleged.She claimed that the BJP leaders are projecting themselves as if they are the only honest people and that leaders of all the other parties are dishonest and corrupt. ""In this context I have often told the BJP leaders that if they are really honest they should make public their accounts and of the party of period ten months prior to demonetisation and a recent one but they have not been able to do so,"" she said."

Forced to choose, in circumstances beyond my control, Economics, my pet aversion till this day, I made full use of Tutorial Hours, cocooned in the General Library and reading fiction and light essays.As I rarely appeared in the classes, the name Mahabali (after the legendary Kerala king who visited his subjects once a year) stuck to me like glue.

Once when he entered the class, there was pandemonium. Taking his chair, he shouted these lines from the Tempest, Hell is empty and all the devils are here.A polite addition from the last row came, And the Satan is on the throne. Once this professor asked the most intelligent student in the class, What is the greatest important factor about nitrates? only to receive the reply, They are lower than day rates.Heckled frequently by a nuisance element, one lecturer asked him, Look young fellow, now that I am here, are you trying to instruct the class? The guy assured him, No, sir. Then, dont talk like an idiot.

The think tank has proposed the government should adopt the system of Price Deficiency Payment against MSPs without unnecessarily going for procurements.While MSPs may still be used for need-based procurement, under the price deficiency payment, a subsidy may be provided to farmers on other targeted produce, contingent on prices falling below an MSP-linked threshold, the NITI Aayog stated.The move has apparently come after reports emerged from various parts of the country that after bumper crops of pulses farmers could not get MSPs due to weak procurement mechanism following which they had to consider distress selling.A senior official of the NITI Aayog said MSPs for wheat, rice and sugarcane have led to the depletion of water resources, soil degradation and deterioration of water quality in the North-west regions. The panel also argued eastern states, where procurement at the MSPs is minimal or non-existent, have also suffered."

5922c3147be9e01fd59abc49,Republicans hope Trump amenable to food stamp restrictions,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/republicans-hope-trump-amenable-to-food-stamp-restrictions-4605439/,2017-04-08,"President Donald Trump (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) President Donald Trump (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)Maine resident Zak McCutcheon says he likes soda but acknowledges hed drink less of it if his governor convinced Republican President Donald Trump to put restrictions on the approximately $200 a month he receives in food stamps. He thinks it may even make recipients healthier and less overweight.If I was more restricted to what I could buy, I would become more of a veggie eater, said McCutcheon, who recently perused grapes and packages of pre-chopped vegetables at an Augusta food bank with his pregnant girlfriend.But another one of Maines 180,000 food stamp recipients, Samantha Watson, said she believes a ban from using food stamps on soda and candy wont make low-income people any healthier. It would take more than that to change eating habits, she said, since food stamps cover only a fraction of the monthly grocery bill for herself and her 3-year-old daughter.Maine Gov. Paul LePage and fellow Republicans in two other states are now renewing their efforts to restrict food stamps in the hopes that Trump will be more amenable than the previous administration.In 2011, former Democratic President Barack Obamas administration rejected then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloombergs soda ban for food stamp recipients and in June, he raised significant concerns with LePages proposal, saying thered be no meaningful way to evaluate whether the ban changed the way recipients bought sweets.While Trumps budget proposal doesnt include food stamp changes, his choice for secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, of Georgia, has signaled support for overhauling the $71 billion Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which administers food stamps to 44 million recipients.LePage is optimistic the new administration will approve his revived proposal, which he says is backed by common sense and a desire to reduce high rates of obesity and diabetes, the latter of which afflicted his mother.The governors efforts in Maine have inspired legislators in Tennessee and Arkansas, who say they wont give up trying to restrict food stamp purchases.We dont allow people to buy alcohol and cigarettes with welfare dollars, why should we allow people to buy junk food that leads to just as many health problems?' said Tennessee Rep. Sheila Butt, a Republican, who hopes Trump will give states more power over the state-run SNAP program.A study of one leading U.S. grocery retailer released in November by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that in 2011, 20 cents of every dollar spent on food stamps went to sweetened beverages, desserts, salty snacks, candy and sugar. SNAP households spent about 5 cents per dollar on soft drinks and 2 cents per dollar on candy, similar to the spending habits of households not receiving SNAP benefits.Last summer, LePage threatened to cease Maines administration of the food stamp program after the USDA raised questions about Maines proposed ban. The governors renewed request would divert federal funds away from nutrition education  which amounted to $4.3 million in the last fiscal year  and toward food banks, schools and other community agencies to distribute healthy foods.Jim Hanna, the executive director at Cumberland County Food Security Council, said poor people have enough issues to manage without being told what to eat and drink, and that a soda or candy tax would be a better approach than eliminating the states SNAP education program.It seems very contradictory to, on the one hand, limit peoples access to foods that have negative nutrition content and then to limit access to information to support them to make better choices about nutrition, Hanna said.The debate over restrictions goes back to the 1940s, when the then-orange food stamps couldnt buy soft drinks, and the 1960s and 1970s, when concern over bureaucracy and figuring out just what counts as junk food hindered attempts to exclude soft drinks.Theres been little change over the ensuing years, although the USDA will soon require stores that accept food stamps to stock more fruits, vegetables and other healthy food. The agencys also providing farmers market with free equipment to accept SNAP debit cards, and supporting programs that provide bonus dollars for purchases at farmers markets.Critics from major medical groups to food policy experts say the existing program promotes chronic illness and amounts to public subsidies for powerful junk food conglomerates that lobby against restrictions. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents companies like Coca-Cola, calls the restrictions a bureaucratic mess.Still others wonder what impact the restrictions might have on SNAP long term. Tatiana Andreyeva, a University of Connecticut professor and director of economic initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, fears that proposals such as LePages could be the first step to the programs decimation.Its very easy to jump from a restriction on sugary beverages to lets just cut benefits, she said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

In September 2015, he was operated on for the disease at Yashwant Rao Chavan Hospital, Pune. According to his wife Sonali Dengde, during the surgery, operating doctor Singh damaged the femoral artery in the right leg that carries blood supply to lower limb. The artery damage led to excessive bleeding forcing Dengde to undergo amputation.I was given two days to decide about amputation. The doctors said I can lose my life because my leg had turned black and infection could spread, Dengde said. The commissioner of Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation directed Punes Sasoon Hospital to investigate the case. A committee of five doctors that was formed observed, Considering the injury to femoral artery and vein, operating surgeon Dr Mannan Singh is responsible for the complications.

PTI file photoAfter waiving farm loans of small and marginal farmers, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is contemplating replicating the 'Amma canteens' of Tamil Nadu (subsidised meal scheme named after former CM, the late J Jayalalithaa) in the state.According to sources, the state government will be setting up Annapurna Bhojnalaya (canteen) in different cities in the state, which would provide breakfast, lunch and dinner at nominal rates.Breakfast will cost Rs 3 while lunch and dinner will be priced at Rs 5 each. Thus, a days meal will cost only Rs 13, said a senior official, who was privy to the information.The draft scheme is almost ready...It will be presented before the chief minister in the next few days, the official added. Sources said that the government planned to launch the project in capital Lucknow, Ghaziabad and Gorakhpur (Adityanaths hometown) on a pilot basis and later extend it to other parts of the state.''We plan to set up Annapurna canteens in all 14 municipal corporations in the state in a phased manner,'' the official said. The scheme would benefit the poor, labourers, rickshaw pullers, daily-wage earners and low-salaried people, he said.The canteens would be run on PPP (public-private partnership) model, he added. Over 250 canteens are likely to be opened across the state...it will cost the exchequer over Rs 150 crore annually, he said.The official said the chief minister may formally announce the scheme in the next few days.Govt orders probeMeanwhile, suspecting a scam of about Rs 1,100 crore, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to conduct a probe into the sale of 21 sugar mills in the state during the BSP rule in 2010-11. The state government might consider recommending a CBI probe into the matter, an official spokesman said here on Saturday.The decision was taken at a review meeting of the sugar cane development department chaired by Adityanath. The chief minister noted that nobody has the right to misuse public property and those violating it will be brought to justice.The chief minister also said FIRs will be lodged against sugar mills if they failed to pay arrears of sugar cane farmers by April 23. He directed officials to take all measures to make operational the defunct sugar mills of the cooperative sector in next crushing season.Adityanath said a committee would be set up to suggest maximum utilisation of resources of sugar mills during the off season."

5922c3767be9e01fc7f59573,Proposed Mexico fuel rule seeks more ethanol blending,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/proposed-mexico-fuel-rule-seeks-more-ethanol-blending/articleshow/58370638.cms,2017-04-26,"By David Alire GarciaMEXICO CITY, April 25 (Reuters) - A plan to raise the amount of ethanol that can be blended with motor fuels in Mexico, which could power job growth and lower air pollution, was submitted to the country's energy regulators by an industry group on Tuesday.The Mexican Association of Sustainable Transportation argues that ethanol is a renewable fuel that can bolster a new domestic industry in rural Mexico where both sugar cane and sorghum are grown, leading to hundreds of thousands of new jobs.But critics counter that the competing fuel additive methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), is better at reducing air contaminants, adding that ethanol can contribute to deforestation due to the need for farmland for its ingredients.Fossil-fuel-derived MTBE is already produced at refineries owned by state-run oil company Pemex, but Mexico still relies on significant imports of the additive from mostly U.S. suppliers to meet domestic demand.If approved later this year, the proposed revision to Mexico's fuel quality standards would raise the amount of allowable ethanol in gasoline to 10 percent from the current 5.8 percent. Ethanol, like MTBE, helps motor fuels burn more efficiently and reduces air pollution.The proposal would bring Mexican fuel standards in line with countries like the United States, where MTBE has been banned by half of U.S. states due to reported cases of groundwater contamination caused by fuel storage tank leaks.In a decision last year, commissioners with energy regulator CRE prohibited any use of ethanol in Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey citing the possibility of increased ozone contamination.The Mexican Association of Sustainable Transportation, backed by existing local ethanol producers and some U.S. firms, submitted the proposal, arguing that approving the rule could lead to some 350,000 new jobs and investment of around $2 billion over the next four years.Leading energy companies including Chevron, BP and Valero Energy also submitted documents outlining their support for the proposal, as did Mexico's main auto industry association AMIA.But not everyone is convinced by the proposal.Daniel Pourreau, an executive with Houston-based refiner and MTBE producer LyondellBasell, said in an interview prior to the proposal that ethanol is an inferior fuel additive.""There is very, very compelling evidence that introducing ethanol into gasoline in Mexico would increase fugitive emissions from cars, especially the older vehicles, and would increase ozone and particulate matter formation,"" he said.A decision by CRE commissioners is not expected until November.

Authorities said that 394 babies benefited from the facility in the current year till March, 31 as 280 mothers donated breast milk.CMCH resident medical officer R. Soundravel said that the milk bank has become main branch of the maternity ward as newborns admitted to special neonatal care unit due to post-delivery conditions of the mothers get timely administration of breast milk stored at the facility.On an average, 250ml of breast milk are donated to the milk bank a day. The donated milk will undergo a bacteriological examination before the container is placed in the freezing unit. The stored milk will be brought back to room temperature and tested again before giving to newborns.The protein, sugar and other contents in the breast milk make it a right medium for bacteria. Hence the collected milk is checked thoroughly for any type of contamination. The milk will also be tested for hepatitis and human immunodeficiency viruses, said V. Booma, nodal officer for special neonatal unit.According to Dr. Booma, the children are given milk from the milk bank when mother's health condition does not allow her to breastfeed the baby. Conditions of the mother like hypertension, diabetes, postpartum psychosis, post delivery bleeding, systemic problems like heart and lung ailments, surgeries like caesarian and sterilisation may demand the babies to be admitted at special neonatal care unit with facilities such as warmer and incubator. Babies born to mothers with the above health conditions from neighbouring districts are also referred to CMCH due to the availability of milk bank. It is also a boon for children abandoned by mothers due to various reasons and admitted at the ward.The babies will be given breast milk from the bank three times at night and seven times during the day. In the case of babies with low birth weight and premature delivery, the feeding will be done one in an hour. The maximum amount of milk that can be fed to such babies at a time is 10 ml which is equal to the size of a table spoon of milk, said Dr. Booma.According to Dr. Bhooma, lactating mothers who are willing to donate breast milk can contact the special neonatal care unit at CMCH. As on Tuesday afternoon, the special neonatal care unit had 87 newborns."

These brands have no ISI certification, and the cartons do not have details of cost, date of manufacture and batch number.While the ice factories in the rural areas are making a fast buck selling their substandard products to schoolchildren, daily wagers and general public, those in the urban areas are not lagging behind.In Chittoor town alone, there are about a dozen units, each deploying mobile ice-cream vending units and boxes at schools, bus-stations, railway level crossings, and commercial areas. These factories supply products to the rural areas also.As the town is already facing severe water problem, these small units are left with no alternative but to use untreated water, which is reportedly left stagnant in cement tanks for several weeks, becoming potential mosquito breeding grounds. For sweetening and colouring purposes, sub-standard material is allegedly used.An ice-cream factory owner at Greamset area admitted that he had been operating his unit for the last four years. We do not know whether we have to obtain any certificate or permission from officials for running the units.He alleged that some official regularly visits their place and collects mamools. Nobody asked us any questions like ISI mark, or date of manufacture or batch number, he said. Three more unit owners came out with similar versions.During the last one month, several children who suffered from fevers, cold, cough and skin rashes allegedly said they suffered the symptoms after consuming roadside ice-cream products. With lesser prices compared to the branded ones, schoolchildren belonging to the middle, lower-middle classes and below poverty categories depend on the unlicensed brands.Ice blocksMeanwhile, huge ice blocks allegedly made of polluted water are in much demand all over the district. Roadside vendors of sugarcane juice, ice-sodas and restaurants buy these blocks at a cheaper price for providing cold water to customers.Speaking to The Hindu , B. Srinivas Reddy, a senior official of the Food inspection department, admitted that a number of unlicensed ice factories were operating in the district.Due to shortage of staff, we are not able to make full-fledged inspections. Those who do business in ice-making have to compulsorily take licence from our department, and should adhere to quality norms. They should also display the details of licence number, manufacturing and batch dates, along with the price, he said."

Of late, the mill has not paying the State advisory price and owed Selvaraj Rs 4 lakh for the supplies made in 2015-16, 2016-17 crushing season.Meanwhile, one of the two borewells that Selvaraj had sunk in his field failed to yield water and he decided to sink a submersible motor at the spot. For this, he took Rs 1.25 lakh as loan from private lenders at a high interest rate of 36 per cent. Even after installing the submersible motor, the borewell did not yield water. The lenders soon started to pester him to return the money. This made Selvaraj even more depressed in the last few days, said A Ayyarappan, Selvarajs brother-in-law.
