COFFEE * July robusta settled down $54, or 2.7 percent, at $1,936 per tonne after slumping to $1,906, the weakest for the second position since September. The contract has fallen around 11 percent in the past three sessions. * Dealers noted the recent decline in the coffee market had been led by arabica, which sank nearly 8 percent and triggered chart-based sell signals last Wednesday and Thursday. * ""London (robusta) has followed New York (arabica) because the funds are starting to throw in the towel,"" one dealer said, adding that funds remain net long and could continue to sell in the short term. * The dealer also said plenty of robusta was available in the spot physical market while roasters appeared to have adequate cover, so were under little pressure to buy. * July arabica coffee settled down 1 cent, or 0.8 percent, at $1.319 per lb, hovering just above Friday's 10-1/2-month low of $1.3155. * ""The move kept the cash market in a quiet state.

Around 50 acres of the tank has seemai karuvelam trees. The ayacut farmers are willing to remove the trees.

Thanikodi, a farmer, said that the trees had not been removed despite making a representation several times with the Block Development Officer.Another farmer alleged that a PWD depot in Alagarkoil Road was filled with seemai karuvelam trees.Responding to the allegations, District Revenue Officer K. Veluchamy, who presided over the meeting initially for sometime, instructed PWD and Forest officials to immediately issue no objection certificates for seemai karuvelam removal.The work is being carried out in a mission mode.

It should be on removing the trees, he said.He also assured them that steps would be taken immediately to remove seemai karuvelam trees, if any, from government offices."

5922c8af7be9e01fc006eb9c,India aims to become self-sufficient in silk production,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/india-aims-to-become-self-sufficient-in-silk-production/article18169365.ece,2017-04-21,"A boon:Scientists have come out with new varieties of mulberry crop that can be cultivated using less water, says Central Silk Board chairman K.M.Hanumantharayappa.M.A.SRIRAMVowing to stop import of silk from China soon, Central Silk Board chairman K.M. Hanumantharayappa has said he had set a deadline of three years for the scientists and officials of the board to take necessary steps for India to become self-sufficient in raw silk production.India is presently producing 28,000 to 30,000 tonnes of raw silk every year as against its requirement of 34,000 tonnes. A shortfall of 4,000 to 6,000 tonnes is being made good by imports from China.Though Karnataka accounted for as much as 60% of the countrys raw silk output, there was no State in the country that was not producing silk, said Mr. Hanumantharayappa while inaugurating a day-long workshop on Entrepreneurial opportunities in Sericulture organised by the University of Mysores Department of Studies in Sericulture Sciences here on Thursday.Mr. Hanumantharayappa said his officials had estimated a time of eight to ten years for India to become self-sufficient. But, I have told them to work towards achieving the target in the next two to three years, he said.Thanks to the on-going R&D activities in the field of sericulture in the country, Mr. Hanumantharayappa said sericulture farmers can now produce not only more amount of raw silk from every 100 disease-free layings, but also reap more mulberry leaves, which serve as food for the silkworms, from an acre of mulberry plantation. Technologically advanced reeling equipment were also made available to the reelers and others associated with the sericulture industry, he said.Observing that a number of students of sericulture were coming from rural areas, Mr. Hanumantharayappa called upon them to pursue sericulture as an occupation instead of pursuing jobs.If you land a job, it is fine. Or else, dont be disillusioned. Sericulture is a very lucrative occupation, he said. While a sugarcane farmer may earn around Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 60,000 for an acre, a sericulture farmer can make more than Rs. 4 lakh now, he said, citing the example of how sericulture farmers from even far-off Maharashtra were satisfied with the price their cocoons command in Ramanagaram cocoon markets.Less waterMr. Hanumantharayappa said the scientists engaged in sericulture research had come out with new varieties of mulberry crop that can be cultivated with a small quantity of water.While an acre of mulberry cultivation was earlier requiring about 3 lakh litres of water for a crop, the new varieties can be grown with just 30,000 litres of water, he claimed.Also, at a time when farmers committing suicide across the country has become a sad recurrence, Mr. Hanumantharayappa claimed that there was no record of any sericulture farmer ending his life.Raw silk productionin the country2012-13  23,679 tonnes2013-14  26,480 tonnes2014-15  28,708 tonnes"
5922c8ec7be9e01fe6dfaeac,Taming the river wild,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2017/may/14/taming-the-river-wild-1604612.html,2017-05-14,"The waterway that brimmed with hectic activity once turned into a brook. For the life around it underwent a drastic change over the past couple of decades. The villagers from Chennithala were left grappling with the hard reality of a dying river in their efforts to complete a ritual on their Palliyodam (snakeboat) to the Aranmula Parthasarathi temple for the annual water festival. R Rakesh, one of the two representatives from the village to the Uthrattathi regatta who accompanies the boat on its annual 24-hour journey, recounted: For the past 124 years, it has been an 82 km journey by water to the temple to participate in the Uthrattathi festival.However, the 12 km of river Kuttamperoor had thinned so much we had to pull the boat with long tugs from the banks. It wasnt fit to be called a river. On many occasions, the journey was an uphill task. But we made it purely because of our spirit and devotion. It has been so for around 15 years, with the past five or six years being particularly painful. According to Rakesh, during the last festival in September 2016, they had to write to the Prime Ministers office to get the way cleared as hyacinths along the route had grown to such an extent one could sit on them comfortably.MGNREGS WOMEN STEP IN The inlet had everything - garbage, mud, weeds, filth, sediments and hyacinth - except water flow. Unchecked, illegal sand mining, clay mining for brick units and encroachment acted as the catalysts to death. Sans the snakeboat making its trip once a year, a requiem for the river was ready until a 70-day initiative by the Budhanoor panchayat through which it flows. The support of nearly 700 women from the MGNREGS has seemingly altered the rivers destiny, with the work to clear at least a channel having finished in February.For the women, it was not merely a job guarantee scheme, panchayat president P Vishwambhara Panicker said. Their work showed their dedication. They toiled with a social commitment. It was exemplary asset creation under the MGNREGS. Rs 72 lakh was earmarked for this. The rivulet was a natural flood control channel between Achankovil and Pampa. It used to flow southwards when the water rose at Pampa and to the north when the waters in Achankovil went up.The tributary that irrigated 2,000 acres of land and fed thousands of families, sadly, became a storage of dumped waste. I started living off this river at the age of 15 and it continued for nearly 50 years. I could support my family with the income from this river, said George, one of the thousands of inland fishermen from the area who joined this endeavour to clear the course. The work started on December 8, 2016 and ended on February 15, 2017. Though there were a few men, 97 per cent of the workers were women from all 14 wards, said Sanal Kumar B, an overseer of the MGNREGS in the panchayat.STOP NOT TILL THE GOAL IS REACHEDThe panchayat is not in a mood to stop at this, though. We will form an action force to maintain the progress we made in the case of the river,said Vishwambhara Panicker. We are aware of the advantages. Water level in around a 5-km radius has increased considerably. The use of water from the river, for purposes other than drinking, is also going up.The same is the case with irrigation. In the next phase, they are coming up with a Rs 4 crore project with the support of Nabard. The Irrigation Department has prepared a detailed project report on a directive from Water Resources Minister Mathew T Thomas. It will focus on the widening, deepening, desilting and putting coir mats on the shores. Action will be taken to evict encroachment with the help of a satellite survey. We are also looking into the possibilities of eco-tourism along this route, he said.When we were kids, we used to steal sugarcane from the country boats while taking a plunge in the river, recalled a native, Sanal, of the days when the Kuttamperoor river was a vibrant mode of transportation. In its prime, large wooden boats carried 100 to 150 tonnes of sugarcane to the Travancore Sugar and Chemicals Ltd (TSCL) through the channel. Round the clock. It is an old story as the sugar factory - as it was popularly called - located at Pulikkeezhu near Tiruvalla on the banks of Pampa stopped sugar production two decades ago. It happened in 1996, exactly 50 years after it started production, said P M John, deputy manager, TSCL.The pond we had in about 2.5 acres to park the boats carrying sugarcane could accommodate some 500 boats. The raw material reached the factory via waterways as the fields were close to streams and rivers. The company had a capacity to crush 750 tonnes of sugarcane on a daily basis. There was sugarcane farming in a radius of 30 km and there were nearly 1000 farmers associated with the factory. There were farmers having land from 50 cents to five acres. The cultivation area had Kottayam to the north and Mavelikkara to the south. Vadasserikkara lay to the east and Veeyapuram to the west. The company used to give employment to 1000 persons - 700 directly and the rest indirectly, he said.The factory required a tonne of sugarcane to produce around 50 kg of sugar.Our yield from sugarcane was low compared to north India. This was mainly due to the special features of our soil. When the average yield was 70 to 80 kg, sugar from a tonne of sugarcane was around 50 kg, said John, who belongs to the area. The factory stopped production due to a number of reasons, including the non-availability of sugarcane. Farming became non-profitable.The cost of farming rose due to a dearth of workers. The cost of sugarcane was fixed at the national level and the price of sugar had a limitation as it is a food item, he said.Sugarcane cultivation thus came to an end and the company stopped sugar production. The boats ceased to travel on the river. The result was the beginning of the end of a riverine system. Well, it isnt dying anymore."

Of the two, Unit-III had closed down on March 19 for maintenance work, while Unit-II went off the grid two days ago following a boiler tube leakage.This would be followed by a 660MW unit in Bara power plant which tripped because of a snag in the boiler. Likewise, a 110MW unit of Tanda too is expected to get operational by May 4. The NTPC owned unit went off the grid after it was closed down for annual overhauling on April 1, according to the UP State Load Dispatch Centre The revival of the units comes at a time when demand for power notches close to 16000MW forcing the state government to resort to other arrangements, including power trading to meet the ever rise in demand. UPPCL estimates the demand for power would touch 17000MW in the next couple of months, given state government's commitment to provide round-the-clock power supply to urban and at least 18 hours to rural areas. Notwithstanding the promise, some districts continue to face repeated power cuts because of local electricity distribution problems, UPPCL officials said.Sources said UPPCL was already in talks with other states to get more power through bilateral trading arrangements. Already, the corporation is buying around 600MW power through bilateral trading. This is apart from state government pushing forth to get power from the energy exchange at relatively cheaper rates. According to records, UPPCL is at present purchasing around 1000MW of power the exchange, while another 400MW is being wheeled into the grid from the co-gen power plants set up in the functioning sugar mills.As a matter of fact, UP has been getting a significant support from the central pool. Records, updated till April 29, show that the state got close to 7000MW from the central sector."

In Bijnor alone, mills owe Rs 151 crore to growers.During the assembly election campaign, the BJP had announced that if it came to power, sugar mills would pay dues within 14 days of purchasing cane from growers. After the party won, sugarcane minister Suresh Rana also instructed the mills to clear the payment of the farmers within 14 days, giving them a deadline of April 23.On Sunday, the deadline passed, but so far many sugar mills have not complied with the government's order.According to data provided by the sugarcane department, there are 116 mills operating in UP. Of these, 83 have been shut after completing crushing for the season. In total, Rs 23,000 crore was to be paid in dues, of which Rs 19,000 crore has been paid. As of now, Rs 4,047 crore in dues are still pending.State secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Rajendra Singh, told TOI, ""We had great expectations from chief minister Adityanath Yogi and we had also given a time limit of one month to his government to ensure pending dues are cleared. But unfortunately all our hopes have been belied. Farmers are facing a financial crunch.

We are making a plan to agitate against Bilai mill from May 10 and have given an ultimatum to the authorities,"" Singh added.""The sugar market has improved this year. Last year, sugar prices were from Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,200 per quintal, but this year it has reached Rs 4,000 per quintal. So there is no excuse for the sugar mill owners and government for not paying dues to farmers,"" the BKU leader said.Bijnor district cane officer OP Singh said, ""There are nine sugar mills operating in the district, of which eight have cleared their dues. Only Bilai remains. Three FIRs have been filed against the mill administration. Besides, we have also kept a strict vigil on the working of the mill. The sugar of this mill is being sold under our supervision. We have issued notices to the mill owner in this regard.""UP minister for cane development and sugar industry, Suresh Rana, said, ""So far all sugar mills have purchased sugarcane worth Rs 23,988 crore and Rs 19,940 crore has been cleared. Of this, Rs 5080 crore have been paid during the tenure of our government. Earlier, some mills did not pay dues of even two or three years. We have got the old dues cleared.

A naturally sweet plant having its origins in South America has made a small entry in Tamil Nadu. Stevia rebaudiana , a native of South America, is a known substitute of sugar for centuries in Brazil and Paraguay . The plant, which is a perennial shrub that grows up to 1 metre tall and has leaves 2 to 3 cm long, grows in tropical zone suitable to plant in Indian climatic condition Jaswant Singh, 56, a buildercum-promoter, who has built a greenhouse at his residence at Mogappair East in Chennai, is giving free saplings to people approaching him and also sharing the knowledge about the stevia plant.""We can use the dry leaves in all food that needs sugar. They more than effectively replace sugar granules that are enriched with chemicals and are bad for humans. I am surprised at the lack of knowledge about stevia plants here,"" said Singh.He has planted more than a dozen saplings of Stevia rebaudiana at his house in separate pots. Explaining the use, he said grown leaves are plucked and dried at room temperature. The dried leaves can be soaked in hot water to make tea or coffee.Stevia is still found growing wild in the highlands of the Amambay and Iguacu districts (a border area between Brazil and Paraguay). It is grown commercially in many parts of Brazil, Paraguay , Uruguay , Central America, Israel, Thailand, and China.Europeans first learned about stevia in the sixteenth century. Then stevia has been used widely throughout Europe and Asia. In the United States, herbalists use the leaf for diabetes, high blood pressure, infections, and as a sweetening agent. In Japan and Brazil, stevia is approved as a food additive and sugar substitute.Director and head of the Centre for Advanced Studies in Botany , University of Madras, Guindy Campus, Mathivanan Narayanasamy said, ""Stevia rebaudiana shrub contains natural sugar content that can be used in our daily life. One can get the plant developed by the horticulture department in Hosur through tissue culture.""He, however, said there is no proper study to compare sugar and Stevia rebaudiana in the country and also abroad. White crystalline sugar is prepared using various processes, that may have animal bones and sulphur, which is bad for consumption."

This year, the sugar cane crushing was particularly low due the drought last year and the sugar factories shut down much earlier than usual.On April 5, the Union government took the decision to import five lakh tonne raw sugar to keep a check on the prices in domestic market. The decision changed the sentiments in the domestic market and traders stopped purchasing sugar from Kolhapur. In the meantime, the bummer production in Uttar Pradesh has led to a decline in demand from northern states.Sugar expert P G Medhe told TOI the government's decision to import sugar has changed the sentiments in market. Moreover, the transportation cost to send sugar to Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh has gone up.""The sugar from UP is available at lower rate for these states than us. Therefore, the overall demand has decreased. The sugar mills have taken loans to recover operational expenses,"" he said.Medhe, who is also the honorary adviser at Chhatrapati Rajaram cooperative sugar factory, said ""The factories have already suffered this year owing to low yield of sugar cane. If the prices of sugar go below the Rs 3,400 per quintal, then it would become difficult to repay the loan. The government should adopt measures to keep the prices stable.""City based sugar trader Atul Shaha said, ""The decision to import raw sugar has slowed down the purchase from Kolhapur sugar factories. Traders have been waiting for further decline in rates. Therefore, sugar is not being purchased from our market."""

Most sugar factories were not making profit, he said.On his increasing visits to religious centres, he said that he was not an atheist.

The recent seizure of hashish oil by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) from two persons hailing from Idukki is a case in point.DRI officers say there is a drug syndicate bringing in hashish oil and ganja from Andhra Pradesh meant for the Gulf countries. We have received the names of a few more gang members, an officer told Express.He said the gang thrives on parties in Kochi and the demand from abroad.As a large number of people from Kerala travel to the Gulf on a daily basis, the drug pushers get carriers, he said.DRI officers had arrested Surendran P R and Karim from Adimali with 5 kg hashish oil costing Rs 5 crore in the international market. Karim is a businessman with shops and lodges in Adimali. The DRI has information about a few more persons involved in the nexus.Other members of the gang went into hiding when the duo was arrested. We are tracing those persons to get a complete picture of the manner in which narcotic substances are smuggled to the Gulf countries, the officer said.The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has busted a number of rackets and seized substances like heroin meant to be smuggled from Kochi. The police have also formed a team headed by a DIG to curb the smuggling of drugs through the three international airports in the state.In the past three years, we busted several rackets, said an NCB officer. One of the reasons is the high demand for such products in those countries fetching a huge profit margin to gangs. The price is almost ten times higher in the international market, he said.Drugs and narcotic substances seized by the Excise Department between May 2016 and March 2017.Ganja - 742 kgHashish oil - 11.246 kgHeroin - 39.61 gmBrown sugar - 105.14 gmOpium - 34 gmCharas - 170 gmAmpules - 57Tablets - 7,544"

But it feared they may soon be returned to the North since ""most repatriations happen two months after detention"".""There is no way to sugar coat this: if this group is forced back to North Korea, their lives and safety will be at risk,"" Robertson said.More than 40 North Koreans, including children and pregnant women, have been held by China over the past nine months, Human Rights Watch said, and at least nine forcibly returned to the North.Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have escaped -- most after a deadly famine in the mid-90s -- and settled in the South.North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is believed to have tightened border controls since he came to power after the death of his father Kim Jong-Il in December 2011.The number of refugees arriving in South Korea plunged nearly 50 percent to 1,417 last year."

Rana asked in a statement.Responding to the statement of AAP leader H S Phoolka that Rana Sugars Limited , in which Rana Gurjeet had shares, was producing power and supplying it to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), the minister said the agreement had been made a long time ago, during the AkaliBJP regime. ""If a company in which I have stakes is supplying power to PSPCL in a transparent manner, following norms and procedures and without my role or influence, should that be held against me?"" He asked.Asserting that there was no conflict of interest in him heading the power ministry, Rana assured Phoolka that within a year he (Phoolka) and the entire Punjab would feel the difference in the power sector.

He also said Phoolka was welcome to expose him in case of any wrongdoing on his part.On Sunday, AAP urged chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to change the portfolio of electricity minister Rana Gurjeet Singh over conflict of interest. AAP MLA and leader of opposition in Punjab Vidhan Sabha, Phoolka said Rana Gurjeet Singh is co-founder of Rana Sugar limited and the company sells electricity to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited, which makes it a clear case of conflict of interest. Being a minister, he said, Rana controls PSPCL, which is purchasing electricity from his firm. Phoolka alleged that Rana Sugar Limited generates 34 megawatts electricity, out of which 20 megawatts is being sold to PSPCL."

People are friendly and hospitable. Some of them may not be able to converse in English but they are ever ready to extend a helping hand if you are stuck. They are forever courteous and eager to please their guests. What more to say? During my visit to Taiwan, I experienced a universal, affable love that is all pervasive - it was all around me and in abundance. These days of technical mad rush, Taiwanese people do stop, smile and welcome you to their country.KaohsiungMy first stop was Kaohsiung, second major city of Taiwan. Since its start in the 17th century, Kaohsiung has grown from a small trading village to a prominent industrial centre of Southern Taiwan. The Pier 2 Art Center in Kaohsiung is a hub of outdoor and indoor art warehouses and museums. It is set around an old and charming unused wharf. The Pier 2 Warehouse main building was used to store sugar, but now houses different contemporary art throughout the year. It is the best place in Kaohsiung for modern art fans, and the area bustles with young art lovers and visitors. The district comprises several other art galleries and museums, which are all next to each other that are full of modern art sculptures, statues and decorated buildings. There are miles of walking paths and a cycle path.Ping-TungIn the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, amazing under water life is exhibited with national habitats ranging from mountains to the sea, thus creating a virtual world. Divided into three main sections, the aquarium is quite educative. It is like following the journey of a raindrop from a mountain-top to the deep recess of the ocean. Waters of Taiwan deals with the water ecology from high mountains through river mouths to the sea in Taiwan. Coral Kingdom Pavilion houses an 80 metre underwater tunnel, presenting varied coral reef ecology in South China Sea. Waters of the World has the earths ancient, lofty, deep and cold ocean ecology topics, wherein the most characteristic part is the 10-meter-high acrylic viewing window of the Giant Kelp Tank, which is the highest in the world. In addition, the penguins from the South Pole and the belugas from the North Pole raised in the museum are popular with visitors. Touch pools are specially designed allow people to get close to marine lifevisitors are encouraged to touch small living creatures like starfish, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea hares, crabs etc.KentingKenting National Park is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Taiwan and the Luzon Straits. Amid Coral Sea cliffs teemed with fringing reefs along the west coast, the park features a large number of mountains, coral tablelands, a vast lake, limestone caves, unique sand rivers and sand waterfalls formed by the combined effects of winds and rivers, as well as coral cliffs, sunken caves and stalactites.But what I liked the most was the night market in Kenting. It was so vibrant with people, games, mobile bars, clothes, footwear, and a myriad other things that would interest a tourist and a shopper. Two nights I freaked out in the night market, buying souvenirs and also things that I didnt really need.TaipeiThe highlight of my Taiwan visit was certainly my memorable stay at Mandarin Oriental, Taipei which is ideally located in the heart of the city on Dunhua North Road, Taipeis main boulevard renowned for its vast canopy of trees. Its extraordinary environment with beautiful European-inspired architecture is complemented by elegant and tasteful interiors. Going around the hotel was like visiting a museum, which I would do often. More than 1,700 art pieces include works of art from renowned artists, stunning antiques, and sculptures designed by the award-winning artists. I was told that the magnificent 1,400-kg chandelier in the Lobby Entrance has 50,000 pieces of crystal beads and light amber crystal drops and took over nine months to make from initial designs to installation. At their Caf Un Deux Trois, the French Restaurant I had the best of the French breakfasts with champagne. Bencotto, the Italian restaurant served authentic, heart-warming cuisine from a team of Italian chefs in a lively, atmospheric setting with a large open kitchen. I enjoyed the ultimate in fine patisserie, cakes and pralines and later burned all the calories in their beautiful swimming pool. All this spelt class and exclusive elegance, pampering me to the core!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

""Before tomorrow's expose, they are spreading fake news and trying to divert attention. It is a ploy to end my hunger strike,"" Mishra said in a tweet.""Doctors gave fake report. They report directly to health minister Satyendar Jain,"" he stated in another tweet.Mishra, who was recently sacked from Delhi cabinet, had started an indefinite hunger strike on Wednesday demanding Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) divulged details of foreign tours undertaken by five of its leaders.Doctors had yesterday advised hospitalisation to Mishra due to drop in blood sugar level and dehydration. Mishra also asked the Delhi police commissioner to not take actions based on ""fake reports"". ""Sir @CPDelhi, Please don't do this just based on a fake report. I am fighting for a big cause. It's a conspiracy,"" the MLA said in a tweet.In a late night development, a team of a team of doctors from RML hospital examined Mishra and said his vitals, including blood sugar level, pulse, blood pressure, is normal.However, he had mild dehydration which is due to no salt intake since last 4 days, the doctors said, adding it was a case of ""starvation ketosis"".Earlier a team of doctors from Aruna Asaf Ali hospital had examined him in the afternoon and evening and advised his hospitalisation.Mishra mounted a fresh attack on chief minister Arvind Kejriwal today, accusing him of using AAP MLAs as ""shield"" after party legislator Sanjeev Jha announced a hunger strike to counter the rebel leader's ongoing fast.Jha was detained by the police twice while he was proceeding to stage the planned hunger strike outside Mishra's residence. He later began his ""indefinite strike"" at Jantar Mantar.Jha has demanded that Mishra come clean on the claim that he saw Health Minister Satyendar Jain pay Rs 2 crore to Kejriwal.In an ""open letter"" to Kejriwal, Mishra again pressed for divulging the details of foreign tours undertaken by five leaders of the party.""How much drama will you create to hide one truth. You are trying all tactics to divert attention. Don't try any new tactic tomorrow.""You (Kejriwal) made a strategy to use MLAs as a shield. However, only one MLA came forward to be that shield?"" Mishra said, adding he would make his next ""expose"" tomorrow.He further said ""thief"" is demanding to hand over all the evidences to him.""Then he would prove himself innocent by becoming a judge, a lawyer and a witness,"" he added.In the morning, Jha, who is an MLA from Burari, went to Rajghat, Mahatma Gandhi's memorial, to ""seek blessings"".""On May 7, Kapil Mishra had said that Arvind Kejriwal had met Satyendar Jain where he paid him Rs 2 crore. My question to him is at what time did he meet the chief minister. Which car did he use? I have the entire day's video footage (of people entering Kejriwal).""The whole world knows about Kejriwal's credentials and he (Mishra) should give evidence to back his claim. If it turns out to be true, even I will join him in his hunger strike against Kejriwal,"" Jha said. Mishra hit back at Jha with another ""open letter"" and ""advised"" him to drink lots of water during the hunger strike."

The natural enzymes found in mango keep the digestive system clean and provide adequate sugar and citric acid to body. However, mango consumption in the Diamond City could create health issues as some wholesalers in the markets have been using calcium carbide to ripen the fruit.It's raining moolah for retailers and wholesalers as the denizens are out in the markets to purchase the succulent mangoes. Following complaints, Surat Municipal Corporation 's (SMC) health department has woken up from slumber and started raiding the wholesalers for using illegal methods to ripen the mangoes. The health department has raided dozens of mango warehouses in Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) market and different areas in central zone in the past two days and destroyed over two tonnes of mangoes that had been ripened using calcium carbide. Around 2,000 kilograms of mangoes were seized.The mango season usually begins from second week of May, but this time around the mangoes have arrived much early in the markets. Seeing the mad rush for mangoes in the Diamond City, large numbers of traders and retailers resorted to artificial ripening of the fruit. One of the common methods adopted by them is to use calcium carbide- a carcinogenic substance which tends to cause cancer.Chief medical officer and deputy commissioner (health and hospital) Dr Hemant Desai told TOI, ""Some traders put packets containing calcium carbide on the fruits to give maximum amount of artificial heat to ripen them fast. Carbide is used for welding purpose and if even a minute quantity is consumed by a human it can lead to serious health problems in the alimentary canal.""With usage of calcium carbide, the fruit's outer skin becomes yellow and even develops saffron colouration. But, the inner portion of the fruit is not ripened. Dr Ramesh Surati of Seventh Day Adventist Metas Hospital told TOI, ""Residents should refrain from eating mangoes ripened with calcium carbide. Its long-term effects are not proved, but it is potentially very harmful."""

The Mula and Mutha rivers carry sewage from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad and meet the Bhima river, which moves to the Ujani dam. On the way MIDC, sugar mills and villages dump their waste into the Bhima and by the time the river reaches Ujani, it is reduced to a mere sewage carrier.Solapur MLA Praniti Shinde said there were serious health implications in Solapur because Pune was not treating its sewage. Solapur city has a limited capacity to treat sewage water. Ramon Magsaysay award winner Rajendra Singh, during his visit to the city last year, had said Solapur people were actually drinking the sewage of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.Civic officials in Solapur have written to the state and the Centre urging them to intervene. ""We are into the Smart Cities Mission and trying hard to improve the infrastructure and overall quality of life in Solapur. But Pune, which is also a part of the mission, is not cooperating. We have repeatedly asked the PMC to stop releasing sewage into our water, but has been no response,"" said one of the top officials in Solapur, adding that the state government had advised ""not to talk"" on this matter in public.The PMC has its own version. Municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar said the city had a plan in place and it was being implemented in phases. According to the plan, the major components include construction of 11 new Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), which will result in creation of an additional treatment capacity of 396MLD over the existing treatment capacity. Once the project is completed, the total STP capacity in Pune will be 873MLD, which will be sufficient to cater to the sewage generation till the year 2027."

This followed widespread grumbling about stagnant living standards among ordinary Saudis.Such perks include housing, vacation, and sickness allowances plus monthly bonuses for some state and military workers.Analysts say the decision does not necessarily signal change in Riyadh's determination to eliminate its deficit. Instead, it may be a tactical move designed to help authorities implement a controversial economic reform programme announced last year by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.That programme includes steps such as new taxes, domestic fuel price hikes, the transfer of much of the burden of development projects to the private sector from the government, and the sale of a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco.By showing it is sensitive to the public welfare and is looking for ways to share the financial benefits of reforms with society, the government may now be able to push ahead with its programme.""The government was forced to take extreme measures last year. Now they are more at ease with the fiscal situation so they are able to give something back to society,"" said John Sfakianakis, director of the Gulf Research Centre in Riyadh.""They aim to continue the reforms, and they want to do it with society's support.""CONSUMERS' POCKETSAnalysts have estimated that restoring the financial perks would put around 50 billion to 80 billion riyals ($13.3 billion to $21.3 billion) annually in consumers' pockets.Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Al Arabiya television that payments would start by the end of May, just before the holy month of Ramadan, when Saudis traditionally splurge on holiday items and travel.Deputy Economy Minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri said restoring the allowances was possible because Riyadh had made faster-than-expected progress in cutting its deficit.The gap was 26 billion riyals in the first quarter of 2017, well below the government's projection of 54 billion riyals, he said. Riyadh has forecast a deficit of 198 billion riyals in 2017 and aims to eliminate the gap by 2020.However, the boost to consumer spending from the restored public will eventually be offset by new austerity measures. A tax on tobacco and sugary drinks will be introduced in coming weeks, raising up to 10 billion riyals annually.Officials also aim to hike domestic fuel and water prices in coming months, raising an additional 29 billion riyals. And a 5 percent value-added tax on most products is to be imposed at the start of 2018.Nevertheless, Sfakianakis estimated restoring the public perks would add half a percentage point to the non-oil economy this year, bringing its growth to around 1 percent.That could be enough for Saudi Arabia to avoid recession -- an important achievement for the economic reformers. A Reuters poll of analysts this month found them forecasting median Saudi gross domestic product growth of just 0.5 percent in 2017.A 1.4 percent rise in the Saudi stock index on Sunday, led by retailing companies, showed investors expect a boost to consumer spending.Authorities also signalled on Saturday that they intended to move ahead with a part of the reform programme that is popular among many ordinary Saudis: reducing corruption and making the government more transparent.A royal decree dismissed the kingdom's information and civil service ministers and set up a committee to investigate allegations of abuse of the civil service office. The decree did not describe any specific allegations of wrongdoing.(Additional reporting by Marwa Rashad Editing by Jeremy Gaunt.)"

A Rs 7.5-crore proposal is on the anvil to establish 'Sholay-the-3D Virtual Reality Village' at Ramadevarabetta for cine lovers. ptiThe ambitious plan of the state Tourism department to recreate the scenes of the blockbuster film Sholay may be shelved by the Forest department.Vijay Kumar, deputy Conservator of Forests, Ramanagaram, said that development, commercialisation and tourism cannot be allowed around the hillocks of Ramanagaram as they have been declared as a vulture sanctuary. The Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, declares a 10-km area around wildlife sanctuaries as an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ). Until any official communication is issued by the ministry redefining the ESZ, a 10-km area around the hillocks will be considered a no-development or no-commercialisation zone, he said.Kumar said that they have also spoken to the Tourism department, but the officials told them that no concrete plan has been prepared yet and the proposal was only in the initial stages. We have also learnt that the proposal has been drafted by the Ramanagaram deputy commissioner. But, so far, we have not received any communication, he added. Kishan Singh Sugara, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), too showed no interest in the proposal.The Tourism department has put forth a proposal to recreate a few scenes from the film Sholay. At an estimated cost of Rs 7.5 crore, the department aims to create a 3D village with the latest audio visual equipment and multiple screens, under public-private partnership.Kumar added that any commercial activity or increase in human movement will have an adverse effect on the surviving Egyptian and Long-billed vulture population in the region. Though no official census has been conducted, it is estimated that there are not more than 30 vultures remaining on the hillocks which are spread over 346.61 hectares.Vultures are listed under schedule-1 of the WPA, 1972. The hillocks of Ramanagaram were declared a vulture sanctuary on January 30, 2012. The state Forest department is also planning to create a vulture restaurant on the hillocks to revive the population.Ramadevarabetta hills are also very popular for trekking and rock climbing. These activities were stopped after the area was declared a sanctuary. To cater to the interest of the people, we have opened a regulated five-km trek route from the department. But we cannot allow any more development around the area, said Kumar."

According to police sources, his farm well went dry due to unprecedented drought situations, leading to a crop failure. Worried of his uncertain future, he consumed poison and was found lying unconscious at his farmland on Friday.Rasu was growing vegetables in his two acre farmland in Mandaiyur using borewell water.

For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane. With no alternatives to offer, authorities had mostly failed to convince them from stopping the age-old practice.The states have now sought subsidies from the Centre to procure machinery to gather crop remnants, as well as financial support to incentivise farmers to adopt modern residue management systems.Officials have also vowed to create awareness among farmers and enforce rules that prevent open burning of farm waste.Stubble burning is a big challenge that we can overcome, by using it for cattle fodder, incorporate it in soil and compost it or use it as fuel in industrial units, said Jasbir Singh Bains, director at Punjabs agriculture department.We have sought an assistance of Rs 1,600 crore from the Centre to buy machineries for farmers. Also, we have requested for Rs 350 crore to compensate farmers whose cost of cultivation increases in case of manual stubble harvest and another Rs 500 crore for diversification of crops. Punjab will also focus on strict enforcement of rules.The states pollution control board will take action against farmers who dont follow rules against burning of waste. The penalty will be Rs 2,500 for two acres of land, Bains said. The transport department will not register new Combine harvesters  which harvest both wheat and rice  till it has an attachment of super straw management system to uniformly keep the loose straw, he added.In Punjab, more than half of the 37 million tonnes of the rice and wheat residues it produces every year are burnt, according to the agriculture ministry. In Uttar Pradesh, the agriculture department is preparing a proposal seeking enhanced subsidy to procure machines that will help reduce farm wastes. We will submit our proposal to the Centre by first week of May, said AK Bihnoi, director at the states agriculture department.With a limited window between harvesting and planting of crops, open field burning of rice, pulses, sugarcane and wheat stubble was the norm, but it is changing because of increasing awareness about pollution, he said. Haryana, too, is seeking similar subsidies.Collectively, various departments are working to ensure that farmers do not burn stubble. We will have to incentivise farmers for adoption of various residue management operations, said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director of Haryanas agriculture department. Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade analyst based in Chandigarh, doesnt see any need for a central subsidy for such steps.The only solution is that combine harvester manufacturers should make farm machines which enable chopping the plant stem from the base, and bundle the straw like a bailer does,"" he said."

They have also threatened a stir if the dues are not cleared soon.In the middle of March, the UP government had directed its sugarcane department to ensure that all the dues of cane farmers are cleared within a month. The government had also asked all the district offices of its sugarcane department to ensure that farmers are given their money within 14 days of the purchase of their produce by the millers.However, sugar mills have to pay Rs 6,600 crore dues to the cane farmers for 2015-16 season. In addition, an amount of Rs 2,000 crore as interest is also pending with them. In its manifesto, the BJP had promised that they will ensure a regime under which the sugarcane dues of farmers are cleared within 14 days.""We want our dues to be cleared. Before the elections, BJP had promised that all the dues will be cleared within 14 days. The chief minister had set April 23 as the deadline for release of the dues.

Unlike other cities in the state, only a few narcotic related crimes had been reported in Thiruvananthapuram till recently. However, Narcotics Control Bureau reports show a disturbing trend.According to a police officer, an improvement in the living standards has seen an influx of high-end psychotropic recreational drugs into the city.The city police have already initiated a crackdown on the peddlers. The police have received information that the drugs including LSD, pethedine, cocaine are now easily available in the city.The police launched a crackdown after getting information about use of narcotics at posh parties in the city. Recently, during one such party, which was held at a hall in Jawahar Nagar, a youth had to face ridicule for not using LSD and cocaine. This conversation which was leaked to the police alerted the law enforcement department to the unhealthy trend which is taking the city by storm.According to Arul R B Krishna, Deputy Commissioner of Police, the incident was the trigger which propelled him to launch a crackdown. We have information that many deadly drugs are making their way into the city. The city has become a niche market for high-end drugs. An other side of development. We are doing our best to stop them. Some areas are under our surveillance. We are expecting a breakthrough, Krishna said.Police said drugs including LSD and cocaine are easy to conceal and cant be detected during normal inspection. Peddlers even conceal it in their undergarments. This factor has turned favourable for those smuggling drugs. Peddlers today prefer drugs over ganja. In fact, the supply of ganja has seen a dip in the city, Krishna added.Unlike ganja, those who buy drugs are from affluent families. Their financial ability has turned peddlers to smuggling narcotics, he added.However, the police face an uphill task when it comes to tracing the source because the racket is not isolated to a specific area. It has an international reach. The police said they wont be able to wipe out the entire racket as long as the demand exists. The cops are on a look out informants to trace the source of supply in the city.Recent haulOn Friday, the city police nabbed three youths for allegedly possessing over 100 LSD stamps (blotters) worth around Rs 3 lakh from the General Hospital junction. During interrogation, the accused revealed that many people are involved in this racket. They sell the drug at a price three to four times higher than the rate at which they get the stuff from Bengaluru. Police suspect the presence of a well-organised working in the city.What is LSD ?It is a psychedelic drug known for its psychological effects. This may include altered awareness of the surroundings, perceptions, and feelings as well as sensations and images that seem real though they are not. It is used mainly as a recreational drug.LSD is typically either swallowed or held under the tongue and comes in the shape and size of a postal stamp. It is often sold on blotter paper, a sugar cube, or gelatin. The colourless and odourless drug could also be sent in crystal form and also as stickers on envelopes. The drugs inconspicuous form makes its chance detection almost impossible for cops. The drug is being abused by well-educated and academically successful youth, say investigators."

Will it amount to murder?Yes, said a lower court in Erode district and awarded life imprisonment to the woman under Sec 302 IPC. She appealed to the Madras High Court and a division bench held on the contrary. At the best, it could be an offence attracting the punishment of just two years imprisonment under Section 318 IPC, it held and ordered her immediate release as she was behind bars for nearly nine years from 2008.Partly allowing the appeal from the woman, now aged 41, a bench of Justices S Nagamuthu and N Sehasayee said the accused did not cause the death of the child and the same was not a homicide. Hence, her conviction under sec 302 IPC cannot be sustained. But at the same, she cannot escape from being convicted for the offence of abandoning the dead body of the child to conceal its very birth. She is punishable under sec. 318 IPC (concealment of a birth by secret disposal of the body).According to prosecution, the woman, belonging to Edapadi village in Salem district, was hardly 30 years when her husband Rajamanickam died in 2006. She developed illicit intimacy with one Palanisamy who impregnated her. As her attempts to terminate the pregnancy failed, she went to Vadapalani village in Erode district to conceal her pregnancy. She was working as a casual worker at a sugarcane field. She decided to return to her native place on November 2, when the pregnancy was in full term.On her way back in a bus, she developed labour pain and got down from at a deserted stop at Moolakadai village. When she was standing alone, the pain aggravated and she delivered the child in the standing position. The child fell down on the cement floor, head first. It neither cried nor was there any symptom of breathing. She took the child in a gunny bag lying in the bus stop and tried to seek the help of others. As there was no house or movement of people around, she started walking and fainted near a lake. After some time, someone came and helped her to reach her village Edappadi.However, a member of the panchayat board found the body of the child and informed police, which took up investigation and arrested the woman."

The counter clock reads 2.30 minutes. The ERO has done their job well.We need to be careful when we note down details. Phonetic sounds are tricky to decipher; for instance, Kancheepuram and Gandhipuram may sound the same, so clarification is required.

These fruits, commonly known as Nongu or Ice apple are a source of livelihood for many people from villages like Cheiyaar, Upudisaakam, Maambakam and more.Annamala, (30) from Maambakam is new to this business. I chose to come here because in our villages we have to carry this on our head and move around. We dont even know if it will be sold there, but here sales are better, he shares.For the last four years, Annamala has been having good sales, but this year he is not happy! I am more into farming, only for these one-and-a-half months I do this, because we get this fruit only once a year. This year, it has been disappointing, he adds, stating that he recently inherited the business from his father.Paneerselvam, who has been doing this for 15 years, says its ironic that this time the heat is more but the business is dull. When we buy it in our villages, it costs `35 per dozen, here we just add about `5 or `10 extra and sell it. What discourages us is many people do not prefernongu only because it comes from a village, he rues. He states that the only benefit they get by coming here is the profit of `200 when compared to the sales in their village.Surendran (16) from a village beyond Cheyaar, looks at this as a visit to the city during summer vacation. For three years, he has accompanied his father and brother to sell. Some days we have good sales while on other days we just dump it all in the garbage and head home. I decided to give it away to people free at the end of the day, but people prefer not to buy that at all.With each dozen being sold at `50 (wholesale price) at 6 am, all vendors from different villages gather at a point with all the fruits. Boarding a mini-van, they reach the city by 10 am and spend the rest of the day by the roadside to sell their fruits. Mahendran, who comes from a progressive family, is newly married and states that people here do realise that there are many health benefits to nongu. Back in our villages, people just climb trees and eat. The actual demand is here, he shares as he negotiates with a customer.DOCTORS SAYNongu has its own benefits. It prevents chicken pox, improves digestion, keeps the body cool, prevents constipation in pregnant women, and more. The fruit has a neutralising effect and is good for acidity, it should not be consumed after storing it forlong in the fridge. Today, I dont think people are aware of these benefits and prefer cool drinks. Also the juice from the fruit (Padhani) has anti-cancer properties too, explains Dr B Ramesh Babu, diabetologist.Dr Sheetal Mathai, Mangalore,l says that one may assume that its low sugar and good fibre content is good to control diabetes. I would personally recommend one to consume the fruit because of its health benefits, it is rich in vitamins A,B and C, iron, zinc, phosphorous, and potassium. The fruit is also good for hydration, helps to relieve constipation and pimples, she adds."
5922cc707be9e01fc7f59dc2,Hidden horror: Thousands of students sexually assaulted in US,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/hidden-horror-thousands-of-students-sexually-assaulted-in-us/articleshow/58457617.cms,2017-05-01,"BRUNSWICK: Chaz Wing was 12 when they came after him. The classmates who tormented him were children, too, entering the age of pimples and cracking voices.Eventually, he swore under oath, the boys raped him and left him bleeding, the culmination of a year of harassment. Though Chaz repeatedly told teachers and administrators about insults and physical attacks, he didn't report being sexually assaulted until a year later, launching a long legal fight over whether his school had done enough to protect him.Chaz's saga is more than a tale of escalating bullying. Across the US, thousands of students have been sexually assaulted, by other students, in high schools, junior highs and even elementary schools  a hidden horror educators have long been warned not to ignore.Relying on state education records, supplemented by federal crime data, a yearlong investigation by The Associated Press uncovered roughly 17,000 official reports of sex assaults by students over a four-year period, from fall 2011 to spring 2015.Though that figure represents the most complete tally yet of sexual assaults among the nation's 50 million K-12 students, it does not fully capture the problem because such attacks are greatly under-reported, some states don't track them and those that do vary widely in how they classify and catalog sexual violence. A number of academic estimates range sharply higher.""Schools are required to keep students safe,"" said Charol Shakeshaft, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who specializes in school sexual misconduct. ""It is part of their mission. It is part of their legal responsibility. It isn't happening. Why don't we know more about it, and why isn't it being stopped?""Elementary and secondary schools have no national requirement to track or disclose sexual violence, and they feel tremendous pressure to hide it. Even under varying state laws, acknowledging an incident can trigger liabilities and requirements to act.And when schools don't act  or when their efforts to root out abuse are ineffectual  justice is not served.This, Chaz Wing said in his lawsuit against the Brunswick school district, is precisely what happened to him.Though both sides contest whether any rapes occurred, the AP found that school administrators allowed Chaz's bullying to escalate and then failed to adequately investigate his allegations of sexual abuse.From almost his first day at Brunswick Junior High, Chaz said kids harassed him, taunted him about his weight and subjected him to ordeals like a ""gay test."" Complaining to teachers and administrators didn't help, he said. He slid into depression and refused to go to school.Then one day in 2012, his mom came home and found him curled up in her bed, rocking back and forth. She begged him to tell her what was wrong. Slowly, his words came out.""They hurt me,"" he cried.He said he'd been raped. Three times.Chaz told police, child-abuse investigators and lawyers under oath that he kept quiet about the assaults for nearly a year because of threats against him and his family if he talked.Sexual abuse allegations can be difficult to investigate. Because many accusers initially keep quiet, physical evidence can be long gone once investigators step in. Often, there are no eyewitnesses, leaving only the conflicting accounts of the accuser and the accused.What Chaz told authorities and investigators  multiple times over four years  remained consistent, an AP review of government and court records shows. And a child-abuse examiner wrote of ""strong evidence"" that Chaz was sexually assaulted.The school district staunchly defends how it handled its investigation. The junior high principal said his inquiry determined that the sexual assaults were ""very unlikely."" One of the accused boys, he noted, had never even heard of anal rape.""There is  as there should be  always an inclination to believe allegations of sexual assault at the outset,"" district lawyer Melissa Hewey said in an email to AP. ""But sometimes, the evidence compels the conclusion that those allegations are false.""""The little boys who were accused,"" she said, ""are the real victims in this case and they deserve to be protected.""Children remain most vulnerable to sexual assaults by other children in the privacy of a home, according to AP's review of the federal crime data, which allowed for a more detailed analysis than state education records. But schools  where many more adults are keeping watch, and where parents trust their kids will be kept safe  are the No. 2 site where juveniles are sexually violated by their peers.Ranging from rape and sodomy to forced oral sex and fondling, the sexual violence that AP tracked often was mischaracterized as bullying, hazing or consensual behavior. It occurred anywhere students were left unsupervised: buses and bathrooms, hallways and locker rooms. No type of school was immune, whether it be in an upper-class suburb, an inner-city neighborhood or a blue-collar farm town.And all types of children were vulnerable, not just kids like Chaz who have trouble fitting in.Unwanted fondling was the most common form of assault, but about one in five of the students assaulted were raped, sodomized or penetrated with an object, according to AP's analysis of the federal incident-based crime data.About 5 percent of the sexual violence involved 5- and 6-year-olds. But the numbers increased significantly between ages 10 and 11  about the time many students start their middle-school years  and continued rising up until age 14. They then dropped as students progressed through their high school years.The AP counted only the most severe forms of sexual assault, excluding categories that were more broadly termed, such as sexual harassment, or behavior like kissing on the playground.Contrary to public perception, data showed that student sexual assaults by peers were far more common than those by teachers. For every adult-on-child sexual attack reported on school property, there were seven assaults by students, AP's analysis of the federal crime data showed.Schools frequently were unwilling or ill-equipped to address the problem, AP found, despite having long been warned by the US Supreme Court that they could be liable for monetary damages. Some administrators and educators even engaged in cover-ups to hide evidence of a possible crime and protect their schools' image.""No principal wants their school to be the rape school, to be listed in the newspaper as being investigated. Schools try to bury it. It's the courageous principal that does the right thing,"" said Dr. Bill Howe, a former K-12 teacher who spent 17 years overseeing Connecticut's state compliance with Title IX, the federal law used to help protect victims of sexual assault in schools.Laws and legal hurdles also favor silence. Schools have broadly interpreted rules protecting student and juvenile privacy to withhold basic information about sexual attacks from their communities. Victims and their families face high legal thresholds to successfully sue school districts for not maintaining safe learning environments.""Everyone feels like we don't have a problem, and the reason they feel that way is they have their heads in the sand,"" said Oregon psychologist Wilson Kenney, who has helped develop student intervention programs.Student-on-student sexual assaults live in the shadows compared to the attention paid to gun violence in schools, most notably the Newtown shooting, Kenney noted. ""There's no Sandy Hook for sexual misconduct. But I think the potential harm is great,"" he said.Chaz's legal fight with Brunswick Junior High offers a rare insight into a school investigation of student sexual assault allegations.The AP reviewed about 1,500 pages of sworn testimony, emails, court documents and investigative reports, as well as videotaped depositions of 15 school administrators, teachers and police, and interviews with a dozen people tied to the case.School and district officials declined AP's interview requests. So did parents of some of the students accused in the attacks, except to say their sons were innocent.The AP does not usually name alleged victims of sexual assault, but Chaz and his parents decided to speak publicly in hopes of helping others.""I don't want this to happen to other kids,"" said his mom, Amy Wing.From Chaz's first days at Brunswick Junior High in September 2010, teachers say it was clear he was the type of kid bullies would target.Overweight with a brown mullet, he had unpopular opinions and wasn't shy about expressing them. He despised sports, video games and pop music. When other boys showed up for a class project in soccer jerseys, he displayed his love of gardening by wearing a hat and gloves, carrying a trowel and handing out flower-shaped sugar cookies.Early on, Chaz testified in his lawsuit, several boys cornered him at his locker, mocking him and calling him fat. What bothered him most, though, was the ""gay test."" Feeling a light touch on his shoulder in social studies class, he brushed off a boy's hand. Seconds later, it was back. It was a test, he was told: If he didn't notice for 10 seconds, he must like it and be gay. Before long, half the boys in the class were doing it.""Why are they so mean?"" Chaz often asked Amy when he came home. ""Why do they hate me?""Initially, Amy urged him to ignore the bullying and try to get along with others. But after the ""gay test"" began, she also encouraged him to report incidents as they happened and so he did, dozens and dozens of times to teachers, his guidance counselor and the principal. He complained so often that he came to be seen as an overly sensitive nuisance.One teacher asked Chaz if he was gay, he testified. ""I told her `no' and she said then don't worry about it.""Finally, Chaz made an appointment to see the principal, Walter Wallace, who had formed an anti-bullying committee shortly after joining the school. In early 2010, Wallace testified, Brunswick students had participated in a survey in which 1 in 6 pupils reported being regularly physically victimized. Wallace implemented a system for documenting student abuse, but it recorded only complaints that were confirmed and then only in the files of the accused, not the victim.In their meeting in late 2010, Chaz said he detailed the harassment  but the problems continued. Wallace later testified he spoke to the boys Chaz identified and ""never heard about it again."" But Chaz said another wave started with a different set of boys.By January 2011, losing patience, Amy first met with Wallace. ""It needs to stop,"" she told him. Two weeks later, as the bullying continued, she was back in his office.Wallace later told her he'd talked to the four main instigators and at least one acknowledged taking part in the ""gay test.""Chaz entered Brunswick Junior High with a ""gifted and talented"" designation, but by the time he started seventh grade in fall 2011, his academic marks had dropped. His harassment complaints were consuming so much of teachers' time that they asked Wallace and his vice principal to take over.""It wasn't happening when we were watching and we were trying to keep a close eye on it,"" one teacher testified, ""but it was always around the corner and away from us.""The principal said he thought Chaz was becoming overly sensitive and made many reports teachers could not substantiate. But Chaz's seventh-grade counselor, Bunny Andrews, testified that she became ""very, very concerned"" as incidents began to pile up.""Chaz was bullied,"" she said. ""I could never deny that.""Then the physical torment he was experiencing escalated dramatically, Chaz testified: In November 2011, he said, he was sexually assaulted by classmates for the first time.According to the lawsuit, the boys crawled under the door of the bathroom stall, put the blade of a small knife against his wrist, ordered him to the ground and overpowered him. After they raped him, Chaz said, one boy threatened to burn down his house, harm his family and kill his pets if anyone found out  then sliced into his right arm.By the following February, Amy noticed Chaz was stressed and unable to complete his work, so she contacted the school.That was around the time Chaz said he was raped again. He testified he had been changing clothes for gym in a locker-room stall because he felt self-conscious about his looks. A different boy pushed his way in past a broken lock as a second boy stood guard outside.The boy forced him against the wall and ripped down his shorts, Chaz said, and it was over in less than two minutes. He stayed silent, he said, cowed by the threats of the first assault.One day in late spring  Chaz can't recall whether it was April or May  the school's power went out shortly before lunch so he left class early to beat the crowd to the cafeteria. As he passed a bathroom, he testified, he was grabbed from behind, dragged inside and pinned against the back wall. It was too dark to see his attackers, but he felt a boy on either side hold his arms. After they finished raping him, he said, he stuffed toilet paper in his underwear to stop the bleeding.Again, Chaz didn't speak out, he said, because he was afraid.Still, records show the school knew Chaz's bullying had become more physical, including an attack he reported in which he was stabbed with a pencil, with the lead breaking off in his arm.In June, school officials created a safety plan that included a teacher escorting him between classes. Two days later, after others gave him grief, Chaz told his escort, ""Please, just don't. This is making things worseBy the end of seventh grade, Chaz was missing days of class and easily agitated and angry. Amy called a lawyer at a non-profit defense fund who thought Chaz might have a case because he was bullied over his perceived sexuality.On the last day of class, Amy marched into the school district's office for a copy of its anti-bullying policy. Two weeks later, she filed a complaint with the Maine Human Rights Commission  kicking off the legal fight that lasted more than four years.Studies have long found bullying can be a precursor to sexual harassment and assault. Typically, victims' grades drop, attendance falls and rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts increase. Schools sometimes miss the warning signs, though, and think it's just ""kids being kids.""""There's just a reluctance to see that there's sexual violence at such a young age,"" said Dorothy Espelage, who researched sexual offenses and harassment among middle schoolers while at the University of Illinois.In October 2010 and April 2011, the US Education Department reminded public school districts that Title IX obligates them to act on bullying and sexual violence. They are required to investigate  separate from any police inquiry  and take prompt action. The department specifically called out anti-gay slurs, sexual remarks, physical harm and unwanted touching  much of what Chaz testified he was telling school officials.School districts have had to report all sorts of data about students, from those who received free lunches to those who brought in firearms. But there is no federal mandate to track sexual violence.By contrast, colleges and universities must keep a public crime log, send emergency alerts about sexual assaults, train staff and aid victims under a federal law named for a student who was raped and murdered in 1986.""Obviously, we care enough to make colleges report,"" said Kansas City, Mo., lawyer Chris Dove, who has represented peer sex-abuse victims. ""Shouldn't we care even more about kids under 18?""Whether  and how  school sexual violence is tracked is determined by individual states, AP found, with wide variations in whether that information is verified or any training on student-on-student sexual assault is required. A survey of state education departments found:32 states and the District of Columbia track student sexual assaults, though some did so only if incidents led to discipline like suspension or expulsion; the other states, including Maine, did not.18 states reported they had training requirements for teachers, school administrators or students about peer-on-peer sex assault Some of the nation's largest school districts reported zero sexual assaults over a multi-year period, and some state education officials told AP they doubted their districts' numbers.In multiple cases, AP found that school districts bungled investigations, failed to supervise students they knew were trouble, neglected to inform authorities or worse.A Mississippi high school failed to secure a computer lab that was the scene of a girl's alleged rape in 2014 and janitors cleaned it before law enforcement could collect evidence, according to court records. District lawyers said that happened because the girl didn't initially say the sex was forced. The three boys accused were suspended but returned to class days later.A Missouri middle-school boy with a disciplinary record of groping girls fondled a female student on a school bus in 2014 and told a school official, ""I can't seem to stop,"" according to a police report. When he moved to the district's high school the next year, he allegedly assaulted a girl in a classroom, police said. The boy claimed it was consensual and was initially suspended for 10 days, but later was charged with second-degree rape, the report said.And in Iowa in 2013, parents didn't report their daughter's allegations of sexual assault to authorities because the elementary school principal indicated he would do so. They found out months later that didn't happen when they sought the police case number, according to the family's lawsuit. The parents then contacted authorities, and a sheriff's investigator took over. The results of his findings in the juvenile case are confidential.When schools mishandle such cases, victims often have little recourse. Prosecutors are sometimes reluctant to charge kids, and clearing legal hurdles to sue districts is difficult.A federal court in Alabama blocked the case of a 14-year-old girl who said she was used as ""rape bait"" and assaulted in 2010 in a botched plan to catch a boy suspected of sexual misconduct. Her case did not meet the legal standards to hold the school district liable, the judge wrote, even though he said the plan, devised by a middle school teacher's aide, was ""foolish"" and backfired ""horribly."" The ruling was successfully appealed, and the district ultimately settled for $200,000.Settlement amounts can be so low that lawyers are reluctant to take on what are typically lengthy, complicated cases. For families, the painful and costly process usually is driven by more than a desire for money.""The notion of holding schools accountable and making sure they make changes to address sexual assault is very important to victims,"" said Adele Kimmel, a lawyer with the Washington, D.C., legal nonprofit Public Justice.Chaz's eighth-grade year had begun well but, as the bullying flared again, he stopped attending school. When he finally told his mom in October 2012 that he had been sexually abused, she called school officials to say Chaz would not be returning to Brunswick.Wallace, the principal, was out of town but alerted his boss, Superintendent Paul Perzanoski. The superintendent said in a deposition that he had not known bullies were targeting Chaz until Amy picked up the anti-bullying policy.Instead of bringing in an experienced investigator, Perzanoski testified that he decided the junior high administrators could handle it. Wallace led the case with the help of Vice Principal Lisa Cushman  the same two people who were tasked with stopping Chaz's bullying. Neither had investigated a sexual assault before or had Title IX training.Cushman interviewed Chaz, with his mom and his guidance counselor present.And Wallace spoke to the four boys Chaz had identified as playing a role in the attacks, in the presence of their parents and a Brunswick police officer assigned to the school, Mike Andreotti, who later testified the principal hadn't kept him informed of Chaz's bullying complaints.Under Education Department guidelines, schools are to conduct their own investigations separate from police inquiries. But, in his deposition, Wallace said he directed the questioning of the four boys, even though it was Andreotti's only meeting with the accused.""It was very strong denials or it was confusion,"" Wallace said of the boys' responses. One, he said, ""had no frame of reference for anal sex.""Wallace testified he surveyed the scenes where Chaz said the attacks took place. He also talked to a coach, who said that based on the space, location and the five to eight minutes boys had before gym, it would be virtually impossible to carry out a rape.Wallace told Perzanoski the sexual assaults were ""unlikely,"" but did not submit a written report. He never interviewed Chaz or talked to his parents about his findings. Instead, he emailed the Wings to say Chaz should return to school.The school resource officer did interview Chaz, over 90 minutes at the police station. Unlike the interview with the accused boys, Chaz's parents were told to wait outside. Andreotti testified that he wasn't sure if they might be part of the problem  even though, Amy noted, they were the ones who had called police.Andreotti told Chaz's parents he would conduct follow-up interviews with the four boys, but he did not do so after deciding there wasn't credible evidence of a sexual assault. Prosecutors agreed.During his deposition, Andreotti was asked whether his viewpoint was changed by a child abuse evaluation he requested, which said Chaz's statements ""were clear, consistent and provided idiosyncratic and sensory details"" and found ""strong evidence"" Chaz had been sexually assaulted.""Absolutely,"" Andreotti said, but he added that a physical examination had found no evidence of recent abuse or trauma. A lawyer for Chaz noted the examiner also said such an absence did not mean abuse didn't occur.""That's correct. It's leaving the option open that it could have occurred,"" Andreotti replied.The retired police officer declined AP's requests for an interview. Brunswick police also declined to discuss Chaz's case or provide a copy of its investigative report, saying juvenile cases were confidential under state law.Andreotti had interviewed about 20 students and teachers and his investigation was ""thorough,"" said Commander Mark Waltz, a police spokesman.""It was all presented to the DA's office, and there were good reasons they made the decision that they did,"" Waltz said, refusing to elaborate. The Cumberland County district attorney's office declined comment.To file suit, the Wings needed to convince the Human Rights Commission that Chaz was harassed over his perceived sexuality, that his learning environment turned hostile and that the school knew yet failed to take prompt, appropriate action.The district said in filings to the commission that the school had taken Chaz's complaints seriously and argued Chaz's perception often ""did not line up with the reality of the events,"" such as the time he reported one of his main bullies hit him with a lacrosse stick. The boy ""credibly stated that he tapped"" Chaz to say hello, the district said.Lawyers for the district also alleged Chaz quit coming to class in an attempt to bolster his complaint. In fact, he had been hospitalized in December 2012  the first of four times  diagnosed with depression, suicidal thoughts and PTSD and told not to return to Brunswick.In June 2014, the commission's investigator found reasonable grounds to believe the district had discriminated against Chaz. She said the school district failed to see the ""overall picture"" of bullying and allowed ""a hostile education environment to persist."" But she reached no conclusion on the reported rapes because, she said, the other harassment was sufficient for her finding. She also noted that the scar on Chaz's arm and his ongoing treatment for depression ""tend to support his allegations.""While the school ""had good policies in place ... it did not do enough,"" in part by handling each incident on a case-by-case basis.One month later, the commission cleared the way for the Wings to sue, which Amy did in July 2015, alleging Title IX violations. The commission joined as a co-plaintiff, it said, ""to ensure that Brunswick has in place effective measures to prevent a hostile education environment based on sex and sexual orientation.""The district's lawyers aggressively quizzed Chaz during his eight-hour deposition. ""How long was the first one on top of you?"" one lawyer asked. ""You just did what he asked you to do?""As the judge neared a decision on whether the case could proceed to trial, the two sides considered a settlement. Weeks of negotiation led to a deal in the fall of 2016: The lawsuit would end, Brunswick would fix some of the tracking flaws that Chaz's case exposed, and Chaz would get $50,000.There would not be an apology  one of the things that Chaz had wanted most.Perzanoski declined AP's repeated requests to meet with him, Wallace and others involved in Chaz's case. He offered only a brief email comment, saying a major reason for the settlement was to allow everyone ""to put the matter behind them and move forward.""Chaz and Amy mark progress by the seasons: Last year, for the first time since telling his mom he'd been raped, he didn't spend part of the fall in a hospital.""The fall is always a hard time for me every year,"" Chaz said, ""because that's the time that the first assault happened. That's the time when I was finally able to tell my mom about what had happened. It's also the time that I left Brunswick Junior High School.""Amy sold the home with the big backyard across the street from her folks where Chaz and his brother had lived all their lives and moved to a nearby town so the boys could attend a different school.Chaz continued to miss class his first two years at his new technology and science high school, where he received specialized instruction because of his depression and PTSD. After changing medication, he missed fewer classes. He sees a counselor every other week.He is one of the youngest owners of a booth at a local flea market, where he chats with weekend visitors about his stash of old rotary phones, TVs, and other vintage electronics. He also works part time at a radio station, reading the weather and selling ads, and thinks he might like a career in broadcasting.In a few weeks, Chaz turns 18 and will graduate. He'd always sworn he'd never leave Maine. Recently, though, he's been thinking about studying or working out of state. It's a sign his horizons may be widening.""I'm still not really sure what I'll do,"" Chaz said. ""Life is an open road."""

Two women, who looked like close relatives, were by her side. Having just reached the final in 56 kg category, the 17-year-old did not look like someone about to wrestle in a gold-medal match. Sporting a cool pair of shades, she was posing for snaps, probably to change her display picture, in one of the many social networking sites.Outside the arena, Sakshi Malik, the star attraction, who had also qualified for the final, was spotted sharing a hearty laugh with a lady who looked like a friend. This calm attitude of Indias wrestlers speaks a lot about the state of the sport and the countrys future. After all, to not get the situation the better of you is one of the primary traits defining a champion.Bajrang Punia celebrates after winning gold inNew Delhi on Saturday | PTIThese are changing times for Indian wrestling. The Asian championship is the first international event where familiar faces are missing. For a start, the future looks bright. A haul of seven medals in the first three days confirms that. Former national coach Vinod Kumar praised the dedication of the new lot. These kids are very involved. Theyve been training hard. Right now, theres more focus on them. I feel theyll get better. They know what seniors have achieved. Thats a lot to draw inspiration from, he said.Changing expectationsFifty-six years. Thats how long it took India to win a second Olympic medal in wrestling, after KD Jadhav. If that feat in Helsinki in 1952 was an aberration, the one in 2008 started a trend. Sushil Kumars bronze in Beijing shifted the focus to wrestling and in London 2012, Sushils silver with Yogeshwar Dutts bronze meant Indians had arrived on the big stage. World Championship medals in between bore further testimony to this. Improved facilities with greater economical support and governments attention played a major role.I think this generation will achieve great heights. Not because we are more talented, but the facilities and infrastructure are much better. Also, there are lots of competitive and practice tournaments that help us analyse and perform better. Sakshis medal at the Olympics has changed the way people look at things, said Ritu Phogat, from the famous family of wrestlers.After Rio, more and more girls are also showing interest in wrestling. We have an akhada back home. There too, lots of girls are showing up everyday. With the release of the film Dangal, the sport has become more popular. I feel womens wrestling in particular will go up in the coming years, said Geeta, another of the Phogat sisters, a World Championship medallist herself.After success in the previous years, 2016 was a bad one for Indian wrestling, because of the selection fight between Sushil and Narsingh Yadav and the latters subsequent failure in a dope test. While this forced the 2015 World Championship bronze winner to head home from Rio, Sakshi Malik lifted Indian spirits. Her fightback from 0-5 down in the bronze bout gave India the first of its two medals in Brazil.Our previous batch was exceptional. As everybody knows, there were controversies before Rio. But its over now and there is no such thing in the new set. In freestyle, Bajrang Punia is our main hope. He will replace Yogeshwar. I think Narsingh has more to offer after the legal complications are sorted out. If that doesnt happen, Jitendra can fill in for him. But watch out for Divya. She has great potential. And obviously there is Vinesh. In 2020, we will have great returns. Our girls, especially, are doing very well, said Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, president of Wrestling Federation of India.Brave, new bunchRemember The Powerpuff Girls? The 90s cartoon series featuring Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup? To create the perfect little girl, Professor Utonium used a mixture of sugar, spice and everything nice. Along with that, he accidentally spilled a mysterious substance called Chemical X that gave the girls super powers including strength, speed and many more. Blossom was the tactical one, Buttercup the strongest and Bubbles as we all know was the cute little one with a kind heart. These three elements  tactics, strength and a kind heart  stand out as far as womens wrestling in Indian is concerned, according to national coach Kuldeep Malik.There isnt much difference between the current and previous batch. Style and rules have changed, but the basics and techniques remain the same. I have lots of expectations from Vinesh and Ritu. After Sakshi, these are girls are in focus. In Rio, we got one medal. The aim is to bag all three in Tokyo. To help them get better, we impart psychological training as well. We believe in the hard work we are putting in, said Malik.He and other coaches feel the mens team is equally talented, but right now, women wrestlers are more popular. Even at the Asian meet, a lot of little girls with their mothers were among the crowd. Speaking to them revealed that they wanted to catch a glimpse of Sakshi or Vinesh. Its a new dawn for Indian wrestling. For a change, the ladies are leading the line."

With some confusion still persisting over whether or not chewing tobacco constitutes food and its ban under the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Regulations-2011, it is clear that for farmers, continuing to grow and manufacture tobacco might be a risky pursuit.An executive committee meeting chaired by Shalini Rajneesh, principal secretary, food and health department, with representatives from the horticulture and Ayush departments last week discussed alternatives before tobacco farmers.Rajneesh said her department was planning to approach the agriculture department and work in tandem with them to facilitate better avenues for farmers. ""The root cause for chewing tobacco and its prevalence is that farmers are continuing to grow these crops. We plan to get in touch with other departments so that we can come up with new marketing tie-ups with companies through government facilitation to ensure greater paybacks. There will be exercises to map different crops grown across the state, various species of plants and the most fertile crop,"" she said, adding that her department could intervene only indirectly in the matter by offering such schemes.Earlier, farmers have been able to scale up their profits through crops like the sugar substitute stevia and the medicinal ashwagandha or ginseng, officials claimed.""A farmer who grows stevia can earn Rs 2 lakh per acre. When it comes to tobacco, the return is only Rs 50,000 per acre. They should grow crops that make economic sense and we should give them better alternatives,"" Rajneesh added.According to Krishnamurthy H M, joint director of the horticulture department (Biotech), under whose department the commercial manufacture of tobacco falls, said Mysuru and Hunsur taluks are where tobacco is predominantly grown in the state.""We deal with fruits, vegetables, flower crops and spices among other things. We will include tobacco growers as well. Stevia is one such alternative crop that can be grown. Since it's a medicinal crop, it comes under the central government's Ayush scheme. Ashwagandha is another potential crop. We are hoping to identify other crops so that they can trade directly with the companies. We are going to approach the agriculture department for this,"" he said.There were also discussions about potentially bringing the farmers under a similar scheme as envisaged by the Centre's Ayush mission, where farmers were given free saplings of medicinal plants along with training on how to grow them. Some training models had been prepared which would have to be altered for tobacco growers, he added."

Also, associations of local vegetable markets, groceries, several trade unions of auto-drivers are among those who support the bandh.State government sources, however, said essential services will not be affected and claimed that the bandh will not have any impact since all necessary measures have been taken to see to it that people were not inconvenienced.Local, long-distance buses of the state-run transport corporations and trains will ply as usual and essential services including milk and electricity supply will be normal, they said.Ruling AIADMK (Amma) and the BJP have hit out at the bandh call terming it politically motivated.On April 16, a meeting of parties including Congress, CPI(M), CPI, VCK, IUML chaired by DMK working president M K Stalin gave the bandh call.According to DMK, the bandh is to urge the central and state governments to fulfil the demands of farmers and farm labourers which includes adequate relief and setting up of Cauvery Management Board. Other demands include remunerative price for paddy, sugarcane, immediate disbursal of cane arrears to the farmers, increasing the water level of Mullaperiyar dam to 152 ft and cancelling Methane and Hydrocarbon projects.Waiver of crop loans given by nationalised banks, adequate monetary compensation to farmers affected by drought are among the demands of a group of ryots who protested in Delhi and in other parts of Tamil Nadu."

Such bans exist in smaller countries like Chile. Celebrity endorsements of such foods should be discouraged, and the online and social media should be sensitised to comply with this advertising ban.It also recommended imposition of additional tax on sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed food (ready-to-eat and ready-to-heat-and-eat foods) to reduce the intake of pre-packaged foods and beverages.The other recommendations include positive nutritional labelling which plays an important role in creating awareness on healthier food choices. The labelling information should be made mandatory for total calories, the amount of carbohydrate, sugars, fat, protein, sodium, dietary fibre and amount of trans-fat added, experts observed.The FSSAI scientific committee has approved the comments and suggestions put forth by the panel. Experts were called from the fields of medicine, nutrition, dietetics from renowned medical research and academic institutions, which was prompted by a related direction from the Delhi High Court on wholesome and nutritious food for children.It is indeed time that attention is turned to high fat, salt and sugar content in food. Though the country has millions living in conditions that make them susceptible to the many communicable diseases, it is diseases and conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases that account for as much as 53 per cent of all deaths in India. A high intake of saturated and trans-fats, sugar and salt are known to significantly increase the risk of chronic diseases.According to estimates, the number of such deaths is expected to touch eight million by 2020  an alarming 100 per cent rise from what it was just two decades ago.Adverse health effect of consumption of fast or junk food which have a high content of fats, sugar and salt, on consumers, particularly in young children, has become a cause of concern, the note on the committee report pointed out.For this, however, the committee had to literally start from scratch. As the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006 does not define the term junk food, the committee defined it as foods like pizza, burgers and soft drinks, and snacks like samosas and pakoras.FatsFats should be largely consumed in the unsaturated fat or fatty acid (of which there is one or more double bond in the fatty acid chain) form.SaltExcess sodium intake is an important determinant of hypertension and cardiovascular risk. According to WHO and ICMR, salt should be restricted to about 5-6 gm per day.SugarA total of 10 per cent of total energy is allowed as added sugars in daily diet. Simple sugars and refined carbohydrates should be reduced.The expert committee analysed various studies on fats, sugar and salt consumption pattern in India and its effects on health. The studies showed consumption of these in the Indian population is high.Junk in the trunkIts common knowledge that non-communicable diseases and cardiovascular illnesses are on the rise. Even though the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, doesnt define junk or fast food per se, these have a high content of saturated fats, trans fats, sugar and salt.Thus, an 11-member expert FSSAI panel has come up with eight recommendations to protect children from such consequences...1. Guidelinesa) Fats: Monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fatty acids and low-fat dairy products should be consumed every day. Bakery goods, which contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and deep fried foods need to be restricted.b) Sugar: Consumption of complex carbohydrates and natural sugar found naturally in fruits and vegetables should be encouraged. However, the intake of simple sugar in sweetened beverages and processed snacks should be limited.c) Salt: Presence of natural potassium in inexpensive, seasonal and locally available fresh fruits and vegetables improve sodium potassium ratio upon eating. Salt rich foods like snacks, pickles are to be avoided.2. Monitor: Periodic monitoring of FSS intake at national level to get evidence and establishing regulatory limits.3. Ban: Adverts about foods with high FSS should not be shown on childrens channels or during kids shows. Celebrity endorsements should be discouraged and social media websites should not promote any FFS content.4. Additional tax: Ultra-processed commodities and sugar-sweetened beverages should have additional taxes slapped on them. It could help reduce FFS intake.5. Awareness: The multifaceted approach should be utilised by bringing nutrition, agriculture, food industries, health and allied sectors into the loop. That way, public health campaigns and school education programmes can raise consumer awareness.6. Reformulation: Industry should be encouraged to opt for food reformulation to reduce FFS content in packaged products.7. Label: Positive nutritional labelling plays a big part in setting trends, so information with regard to total calories, food value, FFS amount should be mandatory.8. Enable: A nutrition-sensitive environment, with health, agriculture and food sectors in sync, will encourage the consumer to switch to better patterns."

Please take the kid to a general physician, as these are symptoms of hypertension or a condition that is commonly referred to as high blood pressure. Yes parents, children too suffer from hypertension.A study conducted in 2013 by Dr Jasmine Sundar, epidemiology department, Dr MGR Medical University showed that 21% of children between 13 and 17 suffer from hypertension. I did the study a few years back with a small group of 400 students. The results were alarming. I will be doing a follow up study with a larger sample size, says Dr Jasmine.There could be various causes of hypertension. With modernisation and globalisation, our lifestyles have changed drastically. We are exposed to different kinds of junk food, and all these food items come with a shelf life, says Dr T Balasubramanian, MGR Medical University. He adds that too much of white food (salt and sugar) is bad for health and urges you to switch to brown sugar, jaggery and palm sugar. Our forefathers would manage with just two meals a day. The rice we eat today gets digested within 90 minutes. This increases our glucose level, and thats why we tend to eat several meals a day.Talking about the two types of hypertension  essential and secondary, Dr Sivasubramanian, a paediatric cardio thoracic surgeon with MR Hospitals, states that essential hypertension is commonly diagnosed in adults and has no known cause. It may be the result of multiple variables, such as genetics, metabolic and socio-environmental factors.Secondary hypertension (high BP) is a result of several problems like kidney diseases, coarctation (congenital narrowing of a short section of the aorta, the largest artery in the body that begins at the top of the left ventricle, the hearts muscular pumping chamber), phaeochromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland), and hyperthyroidism that could be the root cause of hypertension.Obesity is another common reason for hypertension. In a study conducted in 2014, children from 51 schools in Chennai were examined and the results showed high incidence of obesity and associated it with hypertension.Ragini Srinivasan, a child counsellor recalls an incident where a Class 12 student with hypertension was brought to her for counseling. The nurse had presumed that the cause of the diagnosis was stress and pressure from studies. During the session, I noticed that the students family was very supportive. The child still felt tired and was complaining of a headache. He was then referred to a general physician. In my follow up sessions, I found that the child was diagnosed with primary hypertension and was on medication. Since the student was overweight, he was asked to follow a healthy lifestyle.It is often difficult to digest the fact that a child is suffering from hypertension and this often creates tension and panic among many parents. Parents generally do not take children for treatment because it is hard for them to believe that a young kid can have a high BP. They are also worried about societal judgements, which in turn will question their parenting skills, she adds.Whereas, Raju Joseph a parent, whose 9-year-old son suffers from hypertension, says, It is very important that we handle such cases sensibly and sensitively. When a kid has high BP, the first thing to do is to take him or her to a pecialist. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing is more important than your kids health.SymptomsSevere headacheHigh levels of anxietyShortness of breathNosebleedTreatmentLifestyle changeLow sodium dietRegular exerciseMedication is rarely necessary in case of children"

Intake of leaves of an excellent herb, Madhunasini, help to a great extent (along with regular exercises and a controlled diet) in maintaining a healthy sugar level.It is known as Gudmar in Hindi; Sakkaraikkolli in Tamil and Malayalam; and Madhunashini in Kannada and Telugu. All these Indian names mean destroyer or killer of sugar owing to its incredible property  it paralyses the taste buds from registering sweetness (only temporarily!).Madhunashini leaves are dried in shade and powdered. Administering orally, 1 teaspoon of this powder with warm water after food thrice a day is recommended for controlling blood sugar. This herb is also reported to be useful in treating cough, asthma, intermittent fever, dyspepsia, constipation, jaundice, cardiopathy and amenorrhoea.This herb is a woody twiner that usually climbs on bushes and trees. This can grow vertically up to 10-m tall and all parts of this twiner exude milky sap when injured.Leaves are arranged in opposite position along the stem and appear minutely hairy and soft when touched. Inflorescences arise in the axils of leaves. Flowers are yellowish-green borne as small clusters; each flower is about 5 mm across. Fruits usually paired like moustache, measure up to 8 cm long and 1 cm broad, tapering towards apex with blunt topa. Seeds are many, dark brown, compressed, papery along margins, with white, silky hair. This silky hair, on top of the seeds, help in its dispersal through the wind.They occur naturally as hedges along streamlets, wayside thickets and scrub forests. In India it grows wild in drier parts of the central and peninsular zone. Profuse flowering can be seen from July through September. This decorative twiner grows both in sunny and shady settings. This can be allowed to twine on wrought iron support, on fence, or any type of structures that can add style and beauty to the garden.Madhunashini can also be planted in pot of over 14 inches by providing suitable support such as iron rods or bamboo sticks. It demands regular watering only till it takes root, which usually happens in four months. When flowering starts, watering can be done once in a week."

(File|Reuters)NEW DELHI: India looks likely to receive higher monsoon rainfall than previously forecast as concern over the El Nino weather condition has eased, the chief of the weather office said on Tuesday, raising prospects of higher farm and economic growth.The state-run India Meteorological Department on April 18 forecast this year's monsoon rains at 96 percent of the 50-year average of 89 cm.""Things have changed for the good since then,"" K.J. Ramesh, director general of the state-run India Meteorological Department, told Reuters in an interview.The monsoon delivers about 70 percent of India's annual rainfall, critical for crops such as rice, cane, corn, cotton and soybeans because nearly half of the country's farmland lacks irrigation.""We assessed 96 percent based on the climatological conditions up to March. Now, conditions are becoming favourable for an improvement over our April 18 estimate,"" Ramesh said.Australia's Bureau of Meteorology recently said there were signs of concerns easing over El Nino.El Nino, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years and was linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods, faded in 2016.The establishment phase of the monsoon north of the equator has already started, and the Indian Ocean Dipole phenomenon - which counters the impact of an El Nino - will have an incremental positive effect on the Indian monsoon, Ramesh said.Pre-monsoon showers have already hit certain dry areas in the southern part of the country, he said, bringing much needed relief to farmers ahead of the start of the four-month monsoon season beginning June.India defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of the 50-year average.NEW PREDICTION MODELJettisoning a statistical method introduced under British colonial rule in the 1920s, the India Meteorology Department has for the first time relied on the so-called dynamic model to improve the accuracy of one of the world's most vital weather forecasts.The new system, based on a U.S. model tweaked for India, requires large computing power to generate three-dimensional models to help predict how the monsoon is likely to develop.Experts say better forecasting could help India raise its farm output by nearly 15 percent, by helping farmers tweak the best time to sow, irrigate or apply fertiliser, and, if rains fail, plan state-wide measures.This would be a major boon for a country already either the world's biggest or second-biggest producer and consumer of rice, wheat, sugar and cotton.Higher farm output will raise the income of some 600 million people who depend on farming for their livelihood, and boost demand for an array of goods and services."

The revelation comes after the police arrested six people in Belagavi on Sunday night on charges of kidnap, murder and extortion.Rohan RedekarPolice arrested Congress leader and former zilla panchayat president Nazir Nadaf for sheltering the gang members. Nadaf was wanted by police for collecting money from a sugar factory in Belagavi.The other arrested - Mujaffar Mohammad Shaikh, Imtiyaz A Dalayat, Jatin Arjun Kadam, Naveed Khaji and Sarfaraz Jamadar - were wanted in two murder cases, besides the suspected kidnap and murder of Rohan Redekar.City Police Commissioner T G Krishna Bhatta said the gang members who were assisted by gangster Rashid Malbari, a close aide of Chota Shakheel, picked up Rohan when they were waiting for his father Suresh. On February 18, 2015, the gang chased Suresh Redekars car, which was being driven by Rohan and stopped it near Nisarga Dhaba on the National Highway.One of the gang members identified the kidnapped man as the son of the businessman. But by then the other members had pushed him into their vehicle. The gang was not sure about their further action and hence decided to kill Rohan, the police said.They stabbed Rohan and threw his body in Chorla Ghat. After the arrests, the accused led the police to the spot where the remains of body were found. The remains have been sent to forensic lab for analysis, the commissioner added.Rohan was kidnapped when he had left home for his factory. The family is one of the top merchants of tamarind in Belagavi and runs a cold storage unit. A case in this regard was registered in Malmaruthi police station.Mother believes Rohan is aliveRohans mother Renuka, however, refuses to believe her son is dead. My son is alive and safe. Neither the police nor any other official has officially intimated us about the death of our son. I do not believe rumours, said Renuka.We heard through the media that Rohan has been murdered which is just a rumour. If that had been the case, we would have been informed by the authorities first, she said. Renuka said she and her husband Suresh Redekar still have hopes that one day, their son will return home safe.Days after Rohan was kidnapped, many people had raised suspicion about his father.

Traffic jam for kilometres, unending queues of visitors, chaos at the entrance and the struggle to exit marked the end of the five-day Aero India.With the final shows falling on a Saturday, lakhs of people thronged the roads to Air Force Station Yelahanka. Conservatively, we estimate that over 3 lakh people came on the last day, said R. Hitendra, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic).Traffic diversions could not contain the chaos. For instance, a majority of visitors were diverted to narrow service roads; while only select gates and airport services could go on the elevated express ways.The result was a line of vehicles stuck for hours on end. Soundarya Krishna and her family had left at 8.30 a.m. in the hope of seeing the morning show. But as vehicle movement slowed down, and queues at entrances grew longer, she could make it only post-noon.Frustration was evident on the ground and on social media, with complaints of bad management, traffic chaos and even calls to end Aero India here.With congestion unrelenting, some of the diversions were removed at the last minute, adding to the chaos. Those travelling to the Air Display Viewing Area  the most popular spot and with the cheapest tickets  were the worst hit, with reports of people being stuck for up to three hours.Adding to this was the confusion over the entry gate (there are 12 gates spread across the air base), long walk from the parking lot to the security check, long queues, sweltering heat and lack of facilities for the disabled or elderly.It wasnt just Yelahanka air base that saw a sea of people. Neighbouring villages of Hunsemaranahalli and even near Bettahalasuru saw thousands standing on rooftops, mud mounds and boulders. This time, it is very chaotic. Till the last edition, the police would drive away those standing close to the Air Force base. But, this time, there are at least 2,000 people standing on the tank bund next to the base, said Ashok, who was vending sugar-cane juice at Hunsemaranahalli.With taxi aggregators nearly out of service, airport buses and BMTC special buses saved the day for those exiting the gates. On Ballari Road, buses were seen running full, with a bus being spotted every couple of minutes."

Currently, some states levy Value Added Tax (VAT) on them.""We have finalised tax rates for a majority of items as well as the exempt list (at today's meeting),"" Jaitley told reporters here.Out of the 1,211 items, the GST rate for all but six was decided on the first day, he said.""Rates have been finalised for the rest,"" he said, adding GST for packaged food items is to be finalised later.""(With) the standard rate items of 12.5 per cent and 15 per cent, plus the cascading effect of local taxes, the tax rate was going up to 30-31 per cent. These 30-31 per cent taxes... have all been brought down to 28 per cent.""Of these, some are items to be used by common man soap, oil -- that has been brought down to 18 per cent.

But what is to be done with packaged and branded food that has to be separately decided. We are yet to make a decision on that,"" he said.Jaitley said the key feature of today's rate decision has been that ""tax rate under GST will not go up for any of the commodities. There is no increase. On many commodities, there is a reduction particularly because the cascading effect of tax is gone.""""Of several commodities, we have consciously brought down the tax. In the overall basket there would be a reduction, but we are banking on the hope that because of a more efficient system, evasion would be checked and tax buoyancy would go up.That despite reduction the revenue neutrality and tax buoyancy thereafter would be maintained,"" he added."

After good sowing and production of major crops in 2013-14, the cultivation took a major hit in the next two years while good rains this year have helped a turnaround.Area increasedThere is a quantum jump in the extent of paddy cultivation during 2016-17 as the crop was taken up in 17.1 lakh hectares when compared to 10.46 lakh hectares in the previous year.The increase is a phenomenal 63.48% (or 6.64 lakh ha) as several major and medium irrigation projects received good inflows and minor irrigation tanks and dug/tube wells with improved groundwater table pushing it further.Increase in the area of coverage of maize and pulses is mainly due to a significant reduction in the extent of cotton, which was sown only in 14.1 lakh ha this year compared to 17.74 lakh ha in 2015-16, 16.93 lakh ha in 2014-15 and 17.13 lakh ha in 2013-14, a senior official of the DES said.

This should be resolved amicably through dialogue. If the (U.P.) governments co-operation is required at any stage then we are ready to do so, he said.Many misconceptions are created about me.

We have started taking action along those lines, he said.You cannot confuse legal and illegal slaughterhouses. The governments orders are clear. If a slaughterhouse meets all legal conditions and has a licence, no one can touch it. If any official does so, he or she will be punished. However, no one will be allowed to spoil public order in the name of illegal slaughterhouses, he said.If somebody is turning vegetarian out of choice then its a good thing and they will stay healthy, he said.

Renewed efforts, coupled with an improved intelligence network, has seen Bengaluru police nab 81 drug peddlers in the first 90 days of 2017. Senior officials currently investigating numerous other cases said that more arrests were likely in the future.Growing concern over increasing number of youngsters - college students and professionals - falling prey to narcotics has spurred the cops, who are on a 'hunt' to bring most peddlers to justice, and take drugs off the streets. Compared to 2016, when cops made 128 arrests in the entire year and 2015 (60), the 81 arrests made this year attest to enhanced efforts by police to nip the menace in the bud.These arrests have also resulted in recovery of large quantities of narcotic substances - ganja or marijuana (81kg), charas (3kg) and brown sugar (500 grams). Although cops have seized cocaine, opium and other substances, they did not have the exact figures of the quantities seized.City police commissioner Praveen Sood said that the drive against peddlers and overstaying foreigners would be intensified. ""Peddlers target educational institutions, particularly those with foreign students. We request these institutions to coordinate with police and help bring down the menace. Educational institutions found to be colluding or ignoring activities of those registered as students but indulging in criminal activities will be dealt with sternly,"" Sood said.In fact, multiple state agencies are working to put an action plan in place to deal with the menace of drug abuse among youngsters. The home department is contemplating serious action against those failing to bring abuse of narcotic substances to the notice of competent authorities - hostel wardens, bar managers, owners of establishments where party drugs are used, etc. Other measures include cancelling licences of establishments that found to be permitting abuse of drugs.Data accessed from Bengaluru police showed that, of the 81 individuals arrested, 26 were foreigners including Africans. But, this detail hardly comes as a surprise for the cops. Between 2010 and 2017, 667 foreigners have been arrested for their alleged involvement in drug peddling. Of these, 302 were convicted while 24 have been acquitted; 49 others are in judicial custody. ""Cases against 251 are pending for trial, while 71 cases are still under investigation. 229 of the foreigners are out on bail,"" police said.Police added that, of the 16 people apprehended for drug peddling in 2016-17 had been residing in the country, despite their visas having expired. ""Naturally, after getting arrested, they apply for bail and get it. The first condition for granting bail is that the accused must not leave the country without the court's consent. The decision turns out to be a boon for these accused, allowing them to overstay,"" said a senior crime branch official."

While a notification to this effect would be released shortly, the move has been welcomed by educators and healthcare professionals.There are an estimated two lakh people with Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, in the country, of which about half would be children, said V. Mohan, chairman, Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre.Children with Type 1 diabetes take about three to four injections of insulin per day  One, taken half-an-hour before breakfast  and a mid-morning snack is very important to prevent low-sugar reactions. Low sugar could cause sweating, trembling, confusion and giddiness, which could lead to huge difficulties while writing exams, and in extreme cases, even coma, he said. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition in which there is total insulin deficiency. That is, the pancreas produces little or no insulin.According to the International Diabetes Federations Atlas 2015, India has the second-highest number of children with diabetes in the world. The Atlas estimated the country had 70,200 children in the 0 - 14 age group. In Chennai, in the ICMR Registry of People with Diabetes with Young Age at Onset, there are 1,660 young people (less than 25 years) with type 1 diabetes, Dr. Mohan said. This is a fantastic decision and should be extended to all Boards and colleges as well, he said.Various measuresThe CBSE already has in place several measures for students with disabilities. While students who have learning disabilities, including dyslexia, are given exemption from subjects such as Language and Mathematics, visually-impaired students are given a separate question paper and allowed scribes. The evaluation process, too, is tweaked for these students.The parent of a 10-year-old girl in Class V at a city CBSE school said this was a welcome decision. If she misses having her snack, her sugar becomes low. We constantly remind teachers about her condition and ask for a little time. With this move, she will be able to eat properly and study better too, said the resident of Kolathur.Students with physical disability and slow learners are usually listed by the board to enable arrangements at the examination centres. When this notification is issued, diabetic students will also be included in the list and arrangements will be made for their snack break, a principal from a city school said.Low sugar could lead to huge difficulties while writing examsV.

MoorthyG_MoorthyThe fight to eradicate the invasive weed, seemai karuvelam trees ( Prosopsis juliflora ), which all these years remained tepid despite strong public opinion regarding its ill-effects, has gained a massive fillip with Madurai Bench of Madras High Courts recent order asking all districts in Tamil Nadu to remove the trees from all places within weeks.Consequently, with the monitoring of Advocate Commissioners appointed by the High Court, Madurai district administration has also intensified its efforts in uprooting seemai karuvelam trees from all the waterbodies and other public properties. Awareness campaigns have been launched urging public to remove the weed from their properties with a warning that they could be penalised for failure to do so. Many volunteering organisations have also pitched in to help the cause.However, concerns have been raised from various quarters that the inefficiencies in removing the trees from all places and ensuring that their regrowth is controlled can make the eradication of seemai karuvelam trees a distant dream.ChallengesOfficials highlight that lack of precise details on the extent of area with seemai karuvelam growth, hesitance among the public and in certain villages in the removal and certain logistical difficulties have proved to be stumbling blocks in the immediate removal of the trees.Pointing out that seemai karuvelam trees in many villages in the common places such as kanmois and poramboke lands were auctioned to meet expenses such as annual temple festivals, P. Manikandan of Madurai District Irrigated and Dry Land Farmers Association, said that some of the villages, therefore, were hesitant to remove them. Acknowledging that it has been a problem in some villages, an official said that seemai karuvelam trees in those villages, however, were being removed despite opposition.While the agents pay only the base price, which is generally low, to the government in the auction for the wood from seemai karuvelam growth in kanmois. However, they often pay a considerable amount to the villagers who indirectly help by letting the trees grow as per a tacit understanding, the official said.The official added that pushing people to remove the trees from their own properties has also been a challenge. A fine of Rs. 500 for a cent and double the amount required for removal (if government does the job) have been announced as penalties. However, it is difficult to monitor and enforce, the official said.Acknowledging the issues in removal from private properties, S.S.A Basha, a resident of Tahsildar Nagar, said there have been delays in removing the weed even from government properties. For instance, we have been struggling to remove it from two acres of land, reportedly belonging to a temple managed by Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department, in our locality for more than two years. It has already added to depletion of watertable and is yet to be removed despite many petitions and media reports, he said.Long-term approachThough the district administration is hopeful of complying with the order of the High Court despite these challenges, civil society members point out that sustained efforts are needed to comply with the order in letter and spirit and to free Madurai from seemai karuvelam.Pointing out that majority of the growth was in waterbodies, N. Palanichamy, president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, said the lease to remove them must be given to the respective ayacut irrigation associations instead of private agents.Farmers in the area have direct interest in keeping the waterbody free from seemai karuvelam. Moreover, the income from selling the wood can be used for maintenance of the tanks. Though we have been demanding this for long, it is generally ignored by the officials, he said.Echoing his views, D. Raghavan, Coordinator, Federation for Vandiyur Water Tank Development, said that, owing to rapid urbanisation, many waterbodies are now situated amid residential areas. Citing the work done by Gomathipuram residents in the maintenance of Vandiyur Tank, he said that residents associations in the respective areas should take ownership to ensure that the waterbodies are free from seemai karuvelam. After all, they are the ones to lose out on groun water if they fail to remove the trees ,  he said.M.C. Saravanan, Coordinator of Vaa Nanba, a volunteers collective, which had taken up the task of removing seemai karuvelam from waterbodies such as Sellur and Kosakulam tanks, said, The seeds of seemai karuvelam has highest survival capacity. Even if the trees are uprooted, they will sprout from the seeds that fall on the ground during the exercise.New growth should be removed every three months for at least two years to ensure that the weed is completely removed. Once you remove the trees, removing the new growth every few months is no big deal. Only commitment is needed, he said.Residents associations in the respective areas should take ownership to ensure that the waterbodies are free from seemai karuvelamD.

Chandrababu Naidu at the helm, he said: The rumours about the Chief Minister will subside as he will come up with more popular schemes to get closer to the people. This is because of the favourable movement of the planet, Guru.Mr. Somayajulu said the the planetary position was favourable to the dairy and agriculture sectors, and crops such as rice, sugar, jaggery, and cotton.Tobacco will suffer, he said. He warned hoarders of tough times as more stringent laws would be promulgated. Mr. Somayajulu said that the economic conditions of people would be improved, leading to their prosperity. There would be more taxation in the sectors such as petroleum and power, he said.Prices will also witness an upswing, but people will take it in their stride.He said summer would be severe for 180 days. Similarly, there would be copious rain. There are indications of earthquake in December, he said.Mr. Somayajulu said that sectors such as construction, medical, education, banking, seed, and pesticide would do well. Compared with the previous year, the happiness quotient will be on the rise this year, he said."

A post-mortem will be conducted on Friday to determine the exact cause of his death but doctors at the Howrah district hospital suspected he suffered a heatstroke.If the cause turns out to be heatstroke, this will be the second such death this season. A 55-year-old gardener had died of heatstroke at Salt Lake earlier this month. Doctors warned the prevailing weather conditions were ideal for causing heatstrokes, which could be fatal in nearly half the cases.Heatstroke is usually prompted by a prolonged exposure to sun. Unless the body is able to lose the heat generated, the hypothalamus or the temperature controlling centre of the brain goes haywire; it eventually collapses and stops functioning.""The body loses heat through three methods: convection, radiation and conduction but several factors could turn them ineffective. First, the elderly are vulnerable as they have a shrunken blood volume that affects the heatlosing mechanism. Secondly, those on anti-hypertensive drugs are at risk, so are those with a cardiac condition or renal diseases.Finally, a sudden drop in blood sugar level could also lead to heatstroke during long exposure to the sun,"" said Debashish Saha, consultant, AMRI Hospitals . The man, who died in Howrah on Thursday, could have belonged to the last group, Saha said, adding a light meal every four hours was a must for those who had to spend long hours in the sun. ""It helps to keep the blood sugar level right. Often, we tend to ignore this basic advice and venture out in the summer heat. This could lead to sudden heatstroke, which seems to have happened to this young man,"" said Saha.Children, too, were a high-risk group, said Samarjit Naskar, a consultant at Belle Vue Clinic , adding this was because they had lower immunity and were more susceptible to heat and cold stress. Though heat tolerance was directly related to body size and weight, children had a larger relative surface area, which exposed them to a greater risk than adults, he said, adding children also took longer to acclimatize to heat.For an adult, it could take a week, but a child may need 10-14 days to get used to a sudden surge in temperature. ""I have just treated a child from Purulia who suffered severe heatstroke last week. He is doing fine now,"" Naskar said. Long gaps between meals could be disastrous in heat, warned Debashish Basu, preventive medicine specialist. ""The muscles help the body's heat-losing process. Now, once they are deprived of protein, they slow down, affecting the process. It could eventually lead to heat-stroke,"" he said. A perfectly healthy youngster, however, was not likely to suffer heatstroke unless he fell into the risk categories. ""With proper food and water intake heat-strokes can be kept at bay. But long exposure to sun should be avoided,"" said Naskar."

So I did a years course in bakery and confectionary, before I got placed at Taj Coromandel.I worked there for almost seven years and then was sent to Taj Hotels in Maldives, which was a milestone for me because I learnt all that I wanted to about baking there. They squeezed, sculpted and shaped me (laughs). I mastered all the European recipes while I was working in Maldives. I believed in the give-and-take policy For every recipe I shared with my colleagues there, I learnt one from them. And that is how I grew as a chef.The microwave-oven and dough-kneader were the only kitchen equipment we had when I started off as a chef. But today, all the equipments are available at our fingertips and makes cooking a lot easier. I must agree that the growth of the industry has been tremendous. Everybody is a food critic today; they know what good food tastes like.My specialities are bakery and confectionary and apart from that, I have specialised in salads and carvings too. I have got a lot of appreciations for my carvings. Once I had made a sugar carving and a man started asking me questions about how I had carved it and how much time it took. Later, I got to know he was a gold medallist in sugar carvings and he was impressed with my work (grins).I like to cook healthy.

After receiving the message she left for home and forgot about it until a week later she received another message bill saying that she has purchased wheat, when she did not.Beneficiaries of the States Public Distribution System (PDS) have been receiving bogus message bills for items they have not purchased from the ration shop. They fear that the retail staff illegally sell their share of the product on the black market and simply bill it under the card of somebody who has not purchased that commodity.Another resident of Villivakkam faced a similar problem. He purchased pulses and sugar and received a bill for the same. However, a few days later, he got a message bill stating that he had purchased palm oil as well. I never use palm oil; so I never buy it. After this incident, I bought the oil and gave it to a poor family nearby. I dont want fair price products to be sold illegally at higher cost, he said adding that he fears that distribution of his PDS smart card may get detained if he lodges a complaint.The situation is prevalent elsewhere in the State too. Speaking to Express in Madurai, B Selvam said his wife went to the ration shop last month to purchase dal and returned due to lack of stock. A few days later I received an SMS stating that I have purchased dal and palm oil using my ration card. I was shocked to see this and went to my ration shop and enquired about it but the employee brushed it aside, saying I received the text perhaps due to a technical glitch. When I was discussing this issue with a friend, he told me that he had recently purchased two items from the ration shop and when he came home he received an SMS saying that he had purchased four items from the ration shop, he claimed.The local official at Madurai denied malpractices in the e-PDS system and said that there are certain technical problems in linking the peoples mobile number to their ration cards. However, officials at the headquarters in Chennai admitted that there is a possibility of fraud and encouraged people to report such incidents so that the Civil Supplies-CID could investigate the case.Digitisation of the PDS has increased reporting of such incidents, according to a senior official in the Civil Supplies Corporation. People are aware of the illegal sales because of the message-bill and we encourage people to report such incidents, the official said adding that entire system from stock procurement to sales would be updated real-time digitally in a year.We are working towards increasing transparency in order to prevent such bogus sales of our products in black market, the official said, noting citizens may be unaware of the fraud or technical error that happens in their name if their mobile number is not linked with their cards."

Now, he is posting a high yield from his vegetable cultivation and is making good money from his 100 cents of land.Vanmeega Venkataachalam, who was a professor at a private college in Mayiladuthurai for the past 30 years, decided to be an organic farmer post retirement. Even as he has a good bank balance, leads a sophisticated life and his children earn high in foreign countries, Venkatachalam took the call to be a farmer for the rest of his life and chose the 100 cents of land in Aandaancherry Village, Tharangambadi block for his dream.Following a fully organic method of cultivation, right from preparing soil using goat dung, earth worms and cow dung, through planting the seeds and fertigation, he has got the best results.Speaking to Express, Venkatachalam said, Though I had an option to rest after retirement, I chose to live in my ancestors village and do organic farming. Earlier, I used to finance all the agricultural practices on my land, though not organic and was not involved myself.I have not done organic farming myself earlier and thought I would give it a try now, as I have enough time. On a probation basis, I chose just 1 acre of the two-acre land in January and first replaced the soil as it was laden with chemical fertilizers and started the ploughing works. Then seven loads of cow dung added to the soil and the seeds were sown. For brinjal, tomato, ladies finger and a few other greens, saplings were planted.Referring to the organic fertilizer used, he said, After buying 5 kg of Panchakavya, mixed it with cow dung, fish wastes, earthworms, buttermilk, sugar cane juice and water. After one week of fermentation, 300 ml of this mixture was diluted with 12 litres of water and sprayed in the farm land once a week from the time of sowing and till now.Venkatachalam further said that he has used garlic ginger mixture as an organic pesticide which prevents the entry of insects into his farm. With this, he is getting at least 300 to 400 kg of vegetables per week, while using the chemical fertilizer he just got 200 kgs last year.Last year, I had spent Rs 30,000 for chemical fertilizer on the 100 cents. Besides labour cost, pesticides and irrigation came to Rs 50,000 to grow vegetables. I could not even get back the investment as the yield posted was very less. This year, I could prepare the organic fertilizer with just Rs 6000. As I have also shifted to drip irrigation, I spent Rs 20,000 for the 100 cents and I am now getting good income, Venkatachalam said, expressing his glee."

The name itself - Shizu San - refers to a fictional traveller or collector of maps, who has travelled across the Southeast Asian countries to collect local recipes from the various shophouses.What is a shophouse, you ask? The story dates back to 18th century Southeast Asia, which was marked by colonial rule. Travellers from the West made their way to the commodity and spice-rich Asian countries and found respite in these shophouses, which were, in laymans terms, opium dens and brothels. When the colonists left, the locals turned these into eateries, catering to the working-class, and serving home-style, comfort food.Holistic, spiritual vibeThe first thing that strikes you when you enter Shizu San, is the gorgeous Tree of Life - lush creepers that hang from the ceiling. These were incorporated into the dcor wishing prosperity and positivity to anyone who sits underneath. The dcor itself is minimalistic, with no in-your-face dragons and red and gold motifs that are common in Asian restaurants. With an outdoor bar, dim lighting and their signature cocktails, an evening out at Shizu San is perfect for this monsoon season.Too many options,too little timeIf you were to say that diners are spoilt for choice here, it would be a serious understatement. The menu at Shizu San is massive (confusingly so, some might think) and picture-heavy! With delicacies from several countries, options in food and drink are endless. The cocktails are unique, and Shizu San has managed to even put an Asian twist to some signature ones. For example, the classic Lynchburg Lemonade usually made with whiskey, sugar syrup and lemon is recreated and called Saigon Lemonade, which has ginger ale for the sweetness and an Asian fruit yuzu for citrusy zing. The traditional Old Fashioned has sugar, orange rind, cherry, soda and bourbon and it has been renamed Genie in a Bottle, in which tamarind candy replaces orange rind.The Hattori Hanzo is a treat to the eyes and the tongue - this delicately flavoured drink changes colour because of the presence of the butterfly pea flower. If youre a fan of the iconic Thai Tom Yum Soup, you must try One Night in Bangkok. This very hard-to-put-down cocktail has the same flavours as the Tom Yum Soup - lemongrass and kaffir lime - but in the form of a cool, refreshing drink.Those looking for something non-alcoholic can go for the Ok Lah, made with orange juice and kaffir lime; or the Iced Milo Milkshake - the Southeast Asian equivalent of Bournvita.The food is elegantly plated and comes in large portions - so do remember to visit when youre famished. Dig into some dimsums to start with - the Poached Chicken dumplings are a big win, as they come with their own tangy broth. For the vegetarians, the delicately flavoured Shitake and Black Mushroom dumplings are ideal. From the sushi bar, give the vegetarian Sriracha Blush or the traditional Rainbow Maki a try. The Asian Watemelon Salad is ideal for summers, and the Penang Laksa Lotus Stems are the perfect, crunchy accompaniment to your meal.Seafood lovers can try the Otak Otak - a mildly flavoured piece of kingfish steamed in a banana leaf, or the Black Pepper Lobster, the latter we found to be not very fresh. The Buri Bop Tuna is the kind of comfort food you crave for when youre down in the dumps - mildly spiced rice with the meat of your choice. Shizu San also has one bowl meals, like Ramen and Khao Suey, perfect for those looking for a quick bite.When you dine at Shizu San, make sure you leave room for dessert. We especially loved the Tender Coconut Cheesecake and the Green Tea Tiramisu, but with the large slices they plate up, sharing is caring is the best mantra to adopt.Grab a quick bite or enjoy a leisurely meal at Shizu San Shophouse and Bar in Phoenix Marketcity, Whitefield.Approximate Cost for two: Rs 1,800"

On Friday, the GST Council will discuss the rates on services and may meet one more time if the tax rates for all items are not decided by then, Jaitley told reporters.Jaitley is hopeful that the GST Council will be able to reach a consensus to finalise the list of exempted items on Friday, including tax rate of gold and bidi.Nearly 81 per cent of the items will fall under below-18 per cent GST rate slabs and only 19 per cent of the goods will be taxed above 18 per cent, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said.Hair oil, soap, tooth paste will attract 18 per cent tax under GST, while sugar, tea, coffee and edible oil will attract a five per cent tax as would be coal which currently attracts a tax of 11.69 per cent. Milk will be exempt from GST and food grains will be cheaper, Adhia added.Smalls cars will be charged one per cent cess on top of 28 per cent tax, while mid-sized cars will attract three per cent cess and luxury cars 15 per cent on top of peak rates.Jaitley said the focus of Thursdays meeting was on fitment of goods under slabs. It has been decided that the rate for capital goods and industrial intermediate items will be taxed at 18 per cent.He said the GST Council has begun discussion on the list of items that will attract zero per cent tax. States sought to have the lowest GST for goods sensitive to their states. Uttar Pradesh wants puja material out of tax net, while other states want exemption for certain other products."

Lamenting that his business has seen a setback in the past 15 years, Raghunanadans son Vijay Kumar said that the same khowa shop used to be crowded when his father was running it.However, the shop will stand firm, he said. Initially, most of the khowa was supplied to these shops from surrounding areas in Hyderabad, he said. In the last 15 years, with a lot of commercial development, milk production at a large scale has come down.Now, most of the khowa supply is from Solapur in Maharashtra and Bengaluru. There are a few new shops here which manage with substandard khowa also. They mostly get supplies from Chittoor district, which is khowa made out of skimmed milk, said Vijay Kumar. Sales have come down by 50 per cent and the sweet khowa that comes from Gujarat, which is white in colour and has sugar mixed in it has become very popular. People are unaware that pure khowa is pale, not white.Lifestyle diseases to blame?Seconding Kumar, some workers from the 40-year-old Babu Bhai klhowa shop said that now the average profit they can earn on the sale of each kg of khowa is eight per cent.Another khowa shop owner said, Manufacturing khowa is not an easy task. In the narrow margin of profit and losses, we can benefit by maximum Rs 16 on the sale of one kg khowa, priced between Rs 200 and Rs 220.Another reason why there has been a sharp decline in the business is because of the rise in lifestyle diseases. A lot of health-conscious people are avoiding high-sugar based sweets, a merchant said.Wont switch businessesThese shops were left to us by our forefathers and they will be preserved at any cost.We sell paneer to make up for the losses we suffer on certain days, a shopkeeper said."

Lot of heart by both fighters. A lot of questions answered by @anthonyfjoshua #JoshuaKlitchsko,"" he tweeted. Lennox Lewis paid tribute to Klitschko for getting up twice in the 11th from devastating Joshua punches.""How much heart did @Klitschko show in this fight? Gotta respect it. Hold ur head high brother! #joshuaklitschko."" tweeted the Briton who was the last man to be the undisputed world heavyweight champion.The Ukrainian had also been sent crashing to the floor in the fifth round as the 27-year-old British fighter took his perfect record to 19 stoppage wins in 19 fights.""What can I say? 19-0, three and a half years in the game. As I said, I'm not perfect but I'm trying and if you don't take part you're going to fail,"" said Joshua who was put on the canvas for the first time in his career in the sixth round of the see-saw battle.""As boxing states, you leave your ego at the door and you respect your opponent. So a massive shout out to Wladimir Klitschko,"" said Joshua.A third defence of his IBF world heavyweight title also earned Joshua the vacant WBA belt as he became the first British heavyweight since Lewis in 2002 to hold two versions of the world title.It was Klitschko's first stoppage defeat since Lamon Brewster beat him in 2004 and leaves his record at 64 wins and five defeats.""The best man won tonight and it's a massive event for boxing,"" Klitschko told Sky Sports.""Two gentleman fought each other. Anthony was better today. It's really sad I didn't make it tonight.""Klitschko was trying to reclaim two of the three belts he lost to Joshua's fellow Briton Tyson Fury by an upset on points in November 2015.The Ukrainian had not fought since then and entered the ring as the underdog in front of Britain's largest boxing attendance since 1939.Klitschko could not establish his jab in the first round and it was Joshua who landed more punches, with the best being a left hook in the opening minute.Joshua began the second confidently and repeatedly found Klitschko with his jab.The Briton missed with a big overhand right at the start of the third round but then connected with a sledgehammer left hand.Klitschko began the fourth full of intent but it was Joshua who started quicker in a thunderous fifth round.The Briton wobbled Klitschko with a left before landing a series of clubbing blows, including a cracking right uppercut, which sent the Ukrainian to the canvas.Klitschko got up but was on unsteady legs and began swinging wildly.Joshua suddenly became static on the ropes after punching himself out. Klitschko seized his moment and began to land flush as he took control.In the sixth, Joshua's early confidence had evaporated and he was dropped by a right hand to the temple.He was up at eight and immediately had to duck a big left from Klitschko before surviving the round.In the 11th Joshua uncorked a sweet right uppercut to snap back Klitschko's head, followed by another right to send his opponent to the canvas.Klitschko courageously got up but was nailed by another right and another right uppercut and went down again.Klitschko got up but when Joshua started to pile on the pressure referee Fields had no option but to save the brave Ukrainian from further punishment."

DH photoAt least 20 people, including four adults fell ill after consuming haal khova (a sweet prepared from milk) sold by a woman in their locality at Srirampuram.Residents of Sanjay Gandhi Nagar slum behind Krishna Flour Mills at Srirampuram in Sheshadripuram were hospitalised hours after consuming the sweet, which was priced at just Re 1 a piece on Tuesday night. They suffered severe food poisoning and were admitted to different hospitals in the city.When DH visited KC General Hospital, where 18 people, including 14 children were admitted, patients said they had vomiting and diarrhoea after consuming the sweet.Mamatha, a relative of a four-year-old admitted to the hospital said, Manjula, a resident of the locality sold sweets to the children, who consumed them around 6 pm on Tuesday. By 8 pm, they began vomiting and we had to rush them to the hospital, she said.Mamatha said Manjula would sell sweets regularly in the locality. She worked at a convention centre as a cleaner. We usually buy boondi (fried gram flour mixture) and sweets from her. She would sell the leftovers from the convention halls, added Mamatha. The mother of one-and-a-half-year-old Nafia said her daughter fell ill after consuming sweets while playing near her house.Condition stableAll those admitted are said to be stable. Dr H Ravikumar, medical superintendent, K G General Hospital said, Since two children were serious, they had to be sent to Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH). Stool examination reports show infection. The food sample has been sent to the Food Safety Authority for examination. Doctors said the two children at IGICH are also stable.Following a complaint by the patients, Srirampuram police arrested Manjula (47). Police said Manjula, a resident of Pillamma slum near Ananda Rao Circle, used to wash utensils at a convention hall nearby.There was a function at the hall on Monday evening and Manjula had collected some leftover haal khovas around 11 pm.She took the sweets home and sold them on Tuesday evening to the children and women. By then, the sweets had become sour and stale because of the soaring temperature and also since they were made of milk and sugar, the police said. Had she stored the sweets in a refrigerator or sold them the following morning, they would have been safe to consume, a senior police officer said."
5922d3d57be9e01fceefbb94,Agrarian distress: market versus the state,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/606727/agrarian-distress-market-versus-state.html,2017-04-16,"Agrarian distress: market versus the stateT C A Ranganathan, DH News Service, Apr 17 2017, 0:01 ISTWe ought to have been celebrating the golden anniversary of the Green Revolution. It had been achieved through the state-induced action of providing improved seeds, increased availability of low cost fertiliser and water backed by state procurement of produce at pre-announced minimum support prices.Mandatory bank lending targets had also been imposed to support the state effort. The immediate impact had been strongly positive. It enabled elimination of the spectre of food shortages which for long had bedevilled the economy. The country is now a large exporter (one of the worlds largest) of farm produce.However, despite these achievements, if you look back over the long sweep of time, from the perspective of rural wellbeing, the results are more mixed. Agrarian distress manifested by frequent farmer suicides and loan defaults, is commonly and almost annually reported across several states. Blaming attribution for this distress is natural. On a default basis, three factors are commonly perceived, either individually or in combination to be causative  insufficiency of water, credit support and procurement support.Energetic state action is thus deemed to occur if focussed energy is shown by the political party in power on these fronts. These actions have repeatedly been witnessed. Analyst and popular perception gets satisfied and the topic gets closed.Frequent re-emergence of distress has not altered this reflexive thought processes even though distress intensity seems to have increased. Maybe a re-look is warranted?A Google check indicates that the average procurements was 20-24 million tonnes of foodgrain (rice, wheat etc) on a production level of about 200 mt in the mid-1990s with some annual fluctuations. This has since more than doubled to over 50-55 mt though absolute production has grown more slowly to about 260 mt. The procurement prices are at MSP which is computed on a cost-plus basis. So, inadequacies in procurement could not be causing an increase in distress levels.As regards bank credit, in 1996-97, India had an aggregate agricultural production of 615 mt (cereals plus fruit and vegetables, sugarcane, floriculture etc). It had climbed to about 880 mt by 2012-13 giving an annual average growth rate of about 2.2% (fruits and vegetables/floriculture had grown much more rapidly while cereals/sugarcane grew less rapidly). Bank credit however grew from Rs 31,400 crore to Rs 5,89,900 crore in the same period representing an annual average growth of over 20%.While credit inadequacy could still be existing in certain unbanked areas, the shortages ought to have decreased over time given this rapidly dissimilar growth even allowing for cost inflation. Incidentally, India is somewhat unique in having its mainline commercial banks also engaging in direct agriculture financing. The credit pricing is significantly subvented.We therefore need to ask whether agrarian distress issues have been properly analysed. It could be asked whether the timing is appropriate to discuss such issues given that several states are facing drought-like conditions following the failure of the winter rains.It could be kept in mind that 2016 was forecast to a good monsoon year but the current year forecasts are not as rosy. Also, climate change in myriad forms is getting experienced across the world creating doubts whether the monsoon deficiency could now become the new normal.So, we come to water. The Food and Agriculture Organisation databases indicate that Indian agriculture has the worlds highest irrigation coverage and consumes double the water used by Chinese agricultural system (and thrice that by the US system) despite significantly lower aggregate production. Also, water usage in India is still increasing on a year to year basis while absolute reductions, despite agri-production increases, are occurring in these countries.A corollary to this could be a question whether our authorities are aware of the water usage of each crop variety and extent it varies from international best practices. It could be useful to mention here that crop productivity benchmarking could also assist in elucidating the factors responsible for agrarian distress.In the case of rice, for example, not only is Indian average productivity below the US and China, it is also below that reported by our south Asian neighbours, none of whom can boast of effective state support for agricultural activities.Admittedly, the state machinery may experience problems in rapidly disseminating/collecting such information given the large vacancies that have inadvertently been created over the years in state extension services due to fiscal problems of the state governments. At the last count, the vacancies were nearing one lakh employees across the states.Contract cultivationOther emerging market economies often attempt to tackle such problems by promoting/incentivising contract cultivation organised by private sector buyers. However, all success stories come from economies having small geographies, not subcontinental-sized systems. This may thus not be entirely possible in India given the wide heterogeneity of our state infrastructures and ease of doing business conditions (which incidentally also include strength of the regulatory framework).Also within states, large local variations in productivity per acre, productivity per tonne of fertiliser used, productivity/water used - going up, in individual cases, to peak international standards, exist. So, what should be the way forward is the question we need to deliberate.This would require that we re-visit our starting assumptions. The basic assumption behind a Big (well intentioned) State is that an individual, a farmer, is a hapless individual who, left to himself, mechanically does what he has been socially been programmed to do over the vast millenniums of our historical past.But maybe, he is not? May be, he is an economic agent not only alert but responding to whatever economic signals he gets. Maybe the widespread agrarian distress is due to the irrational price signals sent out by the state?So, does differential loan pricing for farm credit-lower rates for micro irrigation but higher for crop loans (especially water- heavy crops) and even higher for water boring systems, though irksome in the short-run, could over time create an efficiency-oriented crop system?(The writer is former chairman, Exim Bank of India)"

More so if the tree is worshipped as a deity and believed to have roots in the Mahabharata.It is for this reason that NBRI will clone Barabanki's revered Parijaat tree that has stood tall for thousands of years in Kintoor village. The three clone trees will come up on the same campus where devotees come to ask for fulfilment of their wishes from the 'kalpavriksha' (the wish-granting tree). National Botanical Research Institute would work on cuttings and tissue culture for the project with an aim to keep the legacy of the tree alive after it is dead.The institute would also conduct a molecular study to find the origin of the tree. Parijaat (Adansonia Digitata) is an African specie with peculiar features. It is a matter of study how it reached Barabanki.The age of the tree has always intrigued scientists. ""We will ask Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences to study the age of the tree,"" said NBRI senior principal scientist SK Tiwari.A team of NBRI scientists including director Prof SK Barik visited the site of the tree last week.Though there is no written account of its history, it is believed that the tree has existed from the time of the Pandavas. It is said to have been born from the 'Samudra Manthan' (churning of ocean) and brought to the earth by Arjun from the garden of Indra for his mother Kunti. According to legend, it was only after Kunti offered Parijaat's flowers to Lord Shiva that Pandavas won the battle of Mahabharat.NBRI has been treating the tree since February 2016 after forest department sought help from the institute. Due to sugary offerings made by devotees to it, the tree was found infected with termites. It also had fungal and bacterial infections.NBRI began a chemical treatment and recommended that a biopesticide be applied on the trunk and leaves of the tree.""The base of the tree still seems affected and we have suggested ways to the forest department,"" said Tiwari.The institute would also try to establish a link between this tree and other age-old Parijaat trees in the state. ""We know of other old Parijaat trees in Basti and Sultanpur. Besides, there are trees on NBRI and zoo campuses too. We will study where these came from,"" said the scientist."

NYTLook on the sunny side of life. Turn your face toward the sun, and the shadows will fall behind you. Every day may not be good, but there is something good in every day. See the glass as half-full, not half-empty.Researchers are finding that thoughts like these, the hallmarks of people sometimes called cockeyed optimists, can do far more than raise ones spirits. They may improve health and extend life.There is no longer any doubt that what happens in the brain influences what happens in the body. When facing a health crisis, actively cultivating positive emotions can boost the immune system and counter depression.Studies have shown an indisputable link between having a positive outlook and health benefits like lower blood pressure, less heart disease, better weight control and healthier blood sugar levels.Even when faced with an incurable illness, positive feelings and thoughts can greatly improve ones quality of life. Dr Wendy Schlessel Harpham, a Dallas-based author of several books for people facing cancer, including Happiness in a Storm, was a practicing internist when she learned she had non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system, 27 years ago.During the next 15 years of treatments for eight relapses of her cancer, she set the stage for happiness and hope, she says, by such measures as surrounding herself with people who lift her spirits, keeping a daily gratitude journal, doing something good for someone else, and watching funny, uplifting movies. Her cancer has been in remission now for 12 years.Fostering positive emotions helped make my life the best it could be, Harpham said. They made the tough times easier, even though they didnt make any difference in my cancer cells.While Harpham may have a natural disposition to see the hopeful side of life even when the outlook is bleak, new research is demonstrating that people can learn skills that help them experience more positive emotions when faced with the severe stress of a life-threatening illness.Judith T Moskowitz, a professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, developed a set of eight skills to help foster positive emotions. In earlier research at the University of California, San Francisco, she and colleagues found that people with new diagnoses of HIV infection who practiced these skills carried a lower load of the virus, were more likely to take their medication correctly, and were less likely to need antidepressants to help them cope with their illness.The researchers studied 159 people who had recently learned they had HIV and randomly assigned them to either a five-session positive emotions training course or five sessions of general support. Fifteen months past their HIV diagnosis, those trained in the eight skills maintained higher levels of positive feelings and fewer negative thoughts related to their infection.An important goal of the training is to help people feel happy, calm and satisfied in the midst of a health crisis. Improvements in their health and longevity are a bonus.Each participant is encouraged to learn at least three of the eight skills and practise one or more each day. The eight skills are: Recognise a positive event each day. Savour that event and log it in a journal or tell someone about it. Start a daily gratitude journal. List a personal strength and note how you used it. Set an attainable goal and note your progress. Report a relatively minor stress and list ways to reappraise the event positively. Recognise small acts of kindness daily. Practise mindfulness, focusing on the here and now rather than the past or future.Moskowitz said she was inspired by observations that people with AIDS, Type 2 diabetes and other chronic illnesses lived longer if they demonstrated positive emotions. She explained, The next step was to see if teaching people skills that foster positive emotions can have an impact on how well they cope with stress and their physical health down the line.Fostering healthy behavioursShe listed as the goals improving patients quality of life, enhancing adherence to medication, fostering healthy behaviours, and building personal resources that result in increased social support and broader attention to the good things in life.Gregg De Meza, a 56-year-old architect in San Francisco who learned he was infected with HIV four years ago, told me that learning positivity skills turned his life around. He said he felt stupid and careless about becoming infected and had initially kept his diagnosis a secret.When I entered the study, I felt like my entire world was completely unraveling, he said. The training reminded me to rely on my social network, and I decided to be honest with my friends. I realised that to show your real strength is to show your weakness. No pun intended, it made me more positive, more compassionate, and Im now healthier than Ive ever been.In another study among 49 patients with Type 2 diabetes, an online version of the positive emotions skills training course was effective in enhancing positivity and reducing negative emotions and feelings of stress. Prior studies showed that, for people with diabetes, positive feelings were associated with better control of blood sugar, an increase in physical activity and healthy eating, less use of tobacco and a lower risk of dying.In a pilot study of 39 women with advanced breast cancer, Moskowitz said an online version of the skills training decreased depression among them. The same was true with caregivers of dementia patients. None of this is rocket science, Moskowitz said. Im just putting these skills together and testing them in a scientific fashion."

""Some people have been spoilt over the last 12-15 years, and their habits will not change in a day.They are still trying to do mischief in some areas. ""I want to warn them again that they should mend their ways or be ready to face the consequences. We will not let any farmer, labourer, trader or daughter suffer,"" he said addressing a gathering after distributing wheelchairs to the physically challenged at village Ratupura.He claimed that the crime rate has come down after his government took charge and the situation will improve further in coming days. He said those violating the law will not be spared, regardless of their political affiliation. ""Law and order in the state has improved but at some places opposition parties are trying to create 'arajakata' (anarchy). Party workers should expose and thwart such attempts,"" Adityanath said in Bareilly while addressing party workers. ""Our main priority is to establish rule of law in the state. I want to assure the people of the state that if someone tries to take the law into their hands, the government and the administration will deal with them firmly,"" he said.The CM said his government had cracked down on the anti- social elements, and cited the anti-Romeo squads against eveteasing and shutting down of illegal slaughterhouses. ""Every person in the state is feeling safe .... Criminals should leave the state or be ready to go to jail,"" said Adityanath. The CM said he was visiting every division to take stock of the law and order situation and development work there. Citing his government's achievement, he said while sugarcane farmers have got their dues, power supply in the state has improved. There is an 18-hour electricity supply in rural areas and a 24-hour supply in urban areas, he said.The CM said that the situation can improve further in villages if illegal connections are checked. Adityanath said that empowerment of the disabled and the poor was among the top priorities of his government. He also held a meeting of divisional officers at circuit house in Moradabad before leaving for Bareilly, where he reviewed the law and order situation. The CM directed the officials not to spare the guilty and also ""not to harass the innocent"".A group of Dalits gathered outside the meeting venue in Moradabd with black flags to protest the violence in Saharanpur. Recent incidents like caste clash in Saharanpur and communal violence in Bulandshahr, Sambhal and Gonda have led to criticism by Samajwadi Party, BSP and Congress of ruling BJP which came to power in UP on the plank of improving law and order. ""This government has clearly failed to fulfil its foremost constitutional duty of providing peaceful and secure life to the people,"" BSP chief Mayawati said yesterday. ""There has been continued attack on traders who are considered the vote base of the BJP and they are observing bandhs... Saharanpur and Mathura incidents have exposed the reality of the tall claims made by the Yogi Adityanath-led government... protests against electricity woes have become common,"" she had claimed. While clashes between Thakurs and Dalits had rocked Saharanpur, two jewellers were shot dead in Mathura.The chief minister, while meeting party workers in Bareilly, said they should highlight the work of Narendra Modi government and actively participate in ""mera ghar, BJP ka ghar"" campaign as a better connect with the people will help in ""exposing criminal elements"". He said that planning for district development will be done with the help of representatives of district BJP units. He also sought names from local BJP organisation for district planning committee."

The agency added that fatalities in its custody are ""exceedingly rare"" and occur at a fraction of the rate of the US detained population as a whole.Patel is the second person to die in ICE custody this week. He is the eighth such individual who died in the custody of ICE the fiscal year 2017.The recent deaths have drawn sharp criticism from immigrant rights activists, who have long decried conditions in immigration detention centres and called on the government to close such facilities.President Donald Trump has called for increasing detention as part of his crackdown on illegal immigration."

Apart from the notorious traffic snarls that daily commuters, motorists and pedestrians suffer, an upsurge in pollution levels has made life miserable for urban dwellers.If a shining India set the stage for a new-found prosperity enshrined in the personal swanky wheels acquired by a well-to-do populace, the outcome of this reality is more about pollution and congestion. On the other hand, citizens are caught in the domino effect of rising global crude oil prices and government policies that unfortunately tend to pinch a few always.An aware Centre, in a bid to ease pressure off citizens and with a common good in mind, is looking at various solutions to help the country grow sustainably.Fuelling without fuelThere has always been a need to scout for alternative sources of fuel and energy to power vehicles. India has accounted for a huge imports bill of Rs 6 lakh crore on crude per annum, and exploring and generating indigenous alternatives would cut crude imports by at least Rs 1 lakh crore.On that note, recently, the government recently announced that it would soon come out with policies on second-generation ethanol and methanol.Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari has also stated that besides creating an industry worth Rs 1 lakh crore, the move could provide employment to around 25 lakh youth.According to data from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, in 2014, the transport sector was the major consumer of diesel, accounting for 70% of the total sales that year.Answering the clarion call of the market, premium bus-makers, armed with global expertise and tomorrows technical know-how, are motoring down environment lane.When it comes to ethanol-based transport solutions, Swedens commercial vehicles giant Scania says it is ready with a whole turnkey offering on its shelf.Scania has 20 years of experience with ethanol technology. We have been making and selling bio fuel buses in Europe, as well as in Brazil, Scania India President Stefan Palskog informs Deccan Herald.It is interesting to note that Brazil, with its huge sugarcane industry, has taken a great leap in the area of blending ethanol into petrol for personal cars, and where Scanias buses run on pure 95% ethanol.But in India, home to many ethanol producers, most of the supply happens to the liquor industry.In order to run a bus engine, ethanol in the denatured form is needed. There are over 600 ethanol producers in India, but very few have the capability to produce and sell denatured ethanol directly to us, Palskog says.An enthusiastic Scania, however, has already unveiled its product in India, with five buses having already been provided to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation on December 3, last year, with 50 additional buses to be delivered by the end of this year.Ethanol, a naturally derived bio fuel, is akin to diesel in performance and reliability, except that it is far more suitable for the environment, with almost zilch CO2 emissions. While the technology is not new, its evolution into a favourable, efficient fuel has been nothing short of cutting-edge. Yet, its adoption in a country like India has been rather subdued; blame it on cost, policy, or plain old perception.Alternate fuel vehicles are very much required to tackle rising pollution levels, and the government is looking at electric, or other solutions. It is initiating good processes for the road ahead, says Price Waterhouse Partner Abdul Majeed, adding that a lot of challenges still persist.He opines, Ethanol is a good concept. As an agricultural country, it all makes sense for India, but regulation is a big problem in the country right now. No major supportive regulations exist for making it commercially viable, which must be sorted out.Says Palskog, The primary perception in India is about cost, rather than value. While people do learn that an ethanol bus is relatively costlier than a regular diesel bus, they are not calculating the value it generates overtime.In India, one must identify the stakeholding chain and it must be in a way that everyone is a winner. Otherwise, if you have one link in that chain winning more that the rest, the chain will break Its all about shifting the tax from one aspect to another. The customer who wants to buy a green bus must be incentivised. The public who will step onto the green bus must be incentivised. The producer must be stimulated to make fuel, and also environmentally-friendly transport. But the present logic is the other way around, he adds.Today, when customers, especially state transport undertakings, buy buses, it is largely on price and not value, and the lowest price wins. While the respective governments contract must include factors such as environment, quality, safety, and then hardware, today, it looks like just hardware.Scania developed its ethanol engine in the mid-1990s. In India, the fuel is being pushed for city buses, for which, the company has identified 12 suppliers of the fuel.In terms of infrastructure, we will set up a tank facility where the bus is serviced. Once the bus returns after its rounds, we will clean, wash, and refuel it. We are providing our customers with fuel for now, as there is no infrastructure available, Palskog says, adding that the company has plans for biogas too.Driving changeRecently, the government extended demand incentives worth Rs 127.77 crore for the purchase of over 1.11 lakh electric and hybrid vehicles under the FAME-India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (hybrid &) Electric vehicles in India) scheme, which also includes buses.Electric mobility is in, and Volvo, another mega Swedish bus pioneer, with decades of pedigree in the said realm, eyes bringing this technology to India.Everything will leapfrog to Euro VI (similar to BS VI) by 2020. Buses will be a part of the strategic direction for Volvo Group, and we look at electric mobility as the next horizon for the bus industry in India, Volvo India Managing Director Kamal Bali says.Volvo Buses began its electric journey with hybrid, and plug-in hybrid is expected to be the next wave, followed by full-electric buses. These buses have already been launched in Sweden and few other countries.Hybrid is part electric, part fuel, which cuts out diesel consumption by over 35%, which means that one uses 50% less carbon footprint, explains Bali, adding that with plug-in hybrid or opportunity charging, one can take 70% power on electricity and remaining on fuel, and the third step being to electrify, with bus stations and depots sporting charging infrastructure.All over the world, Volvo operates all three solutions, between which, it has sold over 7,000 buses. In India, there are two hybrid bus units (city buses in Mumbai) on the road right now, while three more are expected.About electric mobility, Majeed says, Theres no point having coal-fired power generation and then running buses, because those (thermal) plants are more dangerous for the environment, adding that sustainable power generation must be encouraged.Volvo Buses is also part of the narrative with Niti Aayog, looking at alternative fuels, especially for long-haul applications. It is also looking at other alternative fuel solutions such as dimethyl ether (DME).With the sector taking its first step, all eyes are on the government hastening its development agenda, with smart cities also on the anvil.Wishing that misconceptions of cost, reliability and safety be allayed, Majeed says, If you reduce the dependency of crude oil import, the economy will pick up, not only in terms of environment, but also financial health."

He was sentenced yesterday to 15 years in prison by US District Judge Darrin Gayles in Miami.The first scheme involved nearly 100 investors who purchased USD 30 million worth of promissory notes purported secured by interests in iron ore mining in Chile. The second scheme involved unlawfully obtaining USD 1.2 million in economic development funds as well as valuable industrial property from the State of South Carolina.Xavier was convicted by guilty plea in January on two counts of wire fraud. One wire fraud count related to the investment fraud scheme and the other count to the South Carolina economic development scheme.According to documents filed in court, from September 2010 through May 2014, Xavier operated Essex Holdings from an office in Miami and raised more than USD 30 million from nearly 100 investors for supposed investments in sugar transportation and shipping, as well as iron ore mining in Chile.He used false financial statements, forged documents and false promises of fixed rates of return, to induce people to invest in company.Most of the money was used for purposes other than what was promised, including to support lavish spending by Xavier and his wife for expensive jewelry, luxury vehicles, wedding expenses, and cosmetic surgery.Eventually, Xavier used new investor money to pay old investors in a Ponzi-like fashion before the scheme collapsed.Evidence filed in court showed that the actual investor losses from the scheme exceeded USD 29 million. The second scheme involved Xavier using Essex Holdings toobtain USD 1.2 million in payments and approximately USD 1.5 million worth of commercial real estate from the South Carolina Coordinating Council for Economic Development (SCCCED), a division of the South Carolina state government, that was supposed to be used to develop a dilapidated industrial property into a diaper plant and rice packaging facility.According to documents filed in the court, he provided false financial documentation to SCCCED in order to obtain the contract, and later provided fake contractor invoices and fake bank statements in order to get paid under the contract.As with the investment fraud scheme, Xavier spent a significant portion of the development money for his personal expenses, and wired some of it to the same overseas accounts used in the investment fraud."

Kandasamy and parliamentary secretary to the Chief Minister K. Lakshminarayanan said the default of employee share occurred during the time of N.R. Congress government.Sharing certain documents related to the default, Mr. Kandasamy said 12 institutions such as Anglo French Textiles, Pondicherry Cooperative Sugar mills, Bharathi Mills, Swadeshi Cotton Mills, Pondicherry Cooperative Mills, Indian Coffee Workers Cooperative Society, Pondicherry State Cooperative Housing Federation, PAPSCO, Pondicherry Cooperative Textiles Processing Limited, Pondicherry Cooperative Wholesale Stores, Nedungadu Cooperative Milk Producers Society and Thirunallar Cooperative Milk Producers Society have to pay a total sum of Rs. 36. 23 crore as employee share to PF. Except for the three institutions, the default period of other institutions dates back to previous N. R Congress government, a perusal of the document suggests.Mr. Kandasamy challenged the Lt Governor to respond to the charges raised against her by the Congress party. He said the government could not write off farm loans, increase old-age pension and disburse scholarship to Scheduled Caste students as the Lt Governor did not give her assent. The BJP in U.P. can write off the loans immediately after coming to power. But the Lt Governor will not allow us to waive the loans, he said.Mr. Lakshminarayanan said the factories, public sector undertakings and cooperative societies had to pay out from their own resources. The government has no role to provide funds for payment of EPF. And the government has been providing grants for payment of salaries and wages from time to time. The EPF is a legal obligation which must be respected and fulfilled. However, it is between the management of the unit concerned and the statutory EPF body to sort out the matter, he said."

We just need to wait for the right dots to connect. Now, if good deeds rewarded, bad deeds are assuredly penalised. This is how the natural balance is restored. We might think we have gotten away. But it arrives without a warming and then, one is caught red-handed. Here is a parable that underscores the fact that we cannot escape the consequences of our actions.A poor villager would carry a kilogram of butter to a shop owner in the city. In exchange, the shop owner would give him some sugar, salt and other essential items that he needed. This arrangement worked well as the shop owner got good quality butter and the poor villager was able to sustain his family by getting vital items for them. The shopkeeper, however, being of a suspicious nature, decided to weigh the kilogram of butter that the farmer got for him. To his shock, he found that the butter actually weighed 900 grams. This made him very upset and angry. When the farmer visited him next he pounced on him and demanded an explanation. The poor farmer joined his hands and explained, Sir, I am so poor that I have no weights to weigh my provisions. On the scales I use, I usually put the one kg sugar you give me on one side and my butter on the other.The shopkeeper had nothing left to say. His bad action had caught up with him and lets just hope he learnt his lesson. We need to be a reflection of what we would like to receive. If you want love, give love. If you want the truth be truthful, if you want respect give respect. What you send out to the world will return to you. Life is actually this simple. What complicates it is the fact that we anticipate more than what we deserve and forget that time is more powerful than all of us and that the Natural Order will seek its balance. After all, our future is just an echo of our past."

The animals are not only provided cold water bath but are also given cold water to drink Zoo sources said around 400 kg of ice is thrown into the artificial water bodies where the animals - both herbivores and carnivores - take a dip to get relief from the heat. ""The quantity of ice varies every day considering the weather conditions and animal behaviour,"" said deputy director of the zoo Jayant Das.Out of around 200 enclosures for the 3,000 animals, almost 50% of them have special summer measures. Besides, ice boxes, the zoo authorities have installed water sprinklers at the aviaries and other enclosures such as that of the chimpanzee and orangutan. ""The roofs of the enclosure have been covered with thatched sheets to provide insulation. We have installed water coolers also at the chimpanzee enclosure as they are required to keep their body temperature low. Besides, coolers have been provided at the quarantine, where the inmates are treated for different ailments,"" said a zoo officer.Both the animals and visitor rest sheds have been made summer-proof by covering the thatched sheet on the roof. The reptile enclosure, especially that of snakes, have been provided with fans so that air flow continues and required ventilation is maintained.Besides bamboo mats and straw thatching, the bird enclosures have water trickling all the time as the avian species need to keep themselves wet in summer. Bears are being provided solid ice to lick.Veterinary doctors monitor the animals health condition on a daily basis. ""As part of summer food, we provide water melon and sugarcane juice mostly to herbivores. Food supplements, which have medicinal values, are also being served apart from keeping ready the medical aids. Coconut juice for the chimpanzee is being served,"" said a zoo officer.Besides, we have also kept a vehicle ready to ferry animals in case of emergency, the officer added."

Karnataka is followed by Tamil Nadu (67%) and Andhra Pradesh (63%).Without exception, all the sample households mentioned non-institutional loan as one cause of farmers suicide. The overall indication was that the pressure exerted by non-institutional lenders was more than that by institutional ones, says the study, conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru.The study was commissioned by the Agriculture Ministry, which shared the report with the Supreme Court in connection with a public interest litigation on farmer suicides that the court was hearing.The survey team interviewed members of 528 victim households  farming families where one member committed suicide  spread across 388 villages in 13 states, including Karnataka. Besides indebtedness, it identified several farming and social causes too behind the rising trend of suicide among farmers.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 12,602 people involved in farming sector (farmers and agriculture labourers combined) committed suicide in 2015, accounting for 9.4% of total suicide victims (1,33,623). The numbers are on the rise for the last three years.State-wise, the maximum number of suicides was reported in Maharashtra (4,291) followed by Karnataka (1,569); Telangana (1,400), Madhya Pradesh (1,290), Chhattisgarh (954), Andhra Pradesh (916) and Tamil Nadu (606) in 2015, accounting for 87% of all farmers suicide in India.Inability to get farm credit and crop failure are also among the drivers pushing a hapless farmer towards suicide.Expectation of loan waiver as one of the causes for suicide was the maximum in Kerala (89%) followed by Karnataka (66%) and Tamil Nadu (57%). Failure of rainfall was a cause for suicide in all states except Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.There are also social causes like drug abuse, alcoholism, extra-marital affair and fear of declining social status.However, the numbers in these categories are far less than farming and indebtedness causes.With the apex court hearing the PIL, the agriculture ministry last month reviewed the measures that the centre and state governments have taken to prevent farmers suicide.In the review meeting, Karnataka officials pointed out that farmers suicide was on a high for the fourth consecutive year because of drought and failure of sugarcane crop."

It has one of the biggest Indian communities on the continent. Indians first entered Uganda to trade and then cultivate sugar cane on the banks of the Nile after the First World War. In 1948, Mahatma Gandhis ashes were consigned to the swirling waters of the Nile here, and almost 50 years later, in 1997, Prime Minister I.K. Gujral established a bust of the Mahatma by the riverside.It was to address this enduring link between India and the East African country that Vice-President Hamid Ansari decided to visit Jinja.Honouring GandhiWe are at the source of the Nile and here to honour Mahatma Gandhi, he said. The Indian community in Jinja and in Uganda is a key part of our relationship with the country, he said.The town is said to be the home of Indian millionaire businessmen Mayur Madhvani and Jay Mehta, who, as Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said, returned to the country after the expulsions of 1972 under Idi Amin. The Bank of Baroda, which set up a branch as far back as 1953, is the towns primary banker and is heavily invested in the local economy.The town reflects the complications of the India-Uganda relationship, with Indians, who pay a lions share of the taxes, are a tiny minority. As far as account holders are concerned, we have a 80:20 ratio of local Ugandans to Indian Ugandans banking with us, but the ratio is reversed when you see the value of business they bring in, Chandan Jha, a senior manager at the bank, said.Sanjeev Patel, a businessman from Kampala, says he does not see any economic dominance or even the events of 1972 as hindrances to expanding the footprint of Indian businesses."

With people, come problems, and in Guatemala they are felt most keenly by women, girls and the indigenous.Here are 10 facts about Guatemala:1. One third of the labor force works in agriculture, and the key exports are sugar, coffee, bananas and vegetables.2. Almost half of Guatemala's population is under age 19, making it the youngest population in Latin America, according to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.3. Nationwide, 46.5 percent of children under age 5 are chronically malnourished. Among indigenous populations, that figure reaches 65 percent, according to Plan International, a British-based children's aid organization.4. A rural indigenous woman is 20 times more likely to die in childbirth than a non-indigenous city dweller in Guatemala, according to Fundaeco, an organization that promotes protection of natural resources and women's rights.5. Eight in 10 indigenous people live in poverty, according to Guatemalan government statistics.6. More than half of indigenous children have stunted growth, according to Mayan Families, a community development organization.7. By age 16, only a quarter of indigenous girls are enrolled in school, Mayan Families said.8. Less than 40 percent of sexually active teens use contraception, according to Guttmacher Institute, a U.S.-based reproductive rights organization.9. A Guatemalan court last year convicted two former military officers of holding indigenous women as sex slaves during the civil war. Eleven Mayan women, many in their 70s and 80s, testified during the historic trial.It was the first time any national court considered charges of sexual slavery during an armed conflict, considered a crime under international law, according to the United Nations.10. Women make up more than half the registered voters in Guatemala but are significantly under-represented in political office and political leadership positions, according to the National Democratic Institute.Women hold 14 percent of its national legislative seats, according to the World Bank.

That might well have been the order of emergency services in Bombay in the 1880s, going by Kiran Joshi's favourite family story. ""Our shop got the fourth telephone number in the city. The first three were emergency numbers,"" says 55-year-old Kiran.Joshi Budhakaka Mahim Halvawala , located on Mahim's Kapad Bazar road, is not a shop so much as an institution for it invented, around 200 years ago, those wafer-thin sheets of confection that Mumbai calls the Mahim Halva.Veiled in butter paper, these sweets are made from a pulp of wheat, sugar, ghee, and a touch of saffron. The paste is then spread on wooden planks, stretched out and sliced to the size of coasters, then sprinkled with dry fruits before being sold for Rs 400 to Rs 600 per kg.Kiran is the eighth generation descendant of Jetha Joshi, a businessman who had travelled from Pushkar to Gujarat and later to Mahim. For years, Jetha went door-to-door selling halwa, sev bundi, ladoos and mo hanthal made by the women in his family , and became known in the neighbourhood as Joshi buddha kaka (old man).The old man's penchant for experimentation led to the famous halva, says Ki ran. The halva's popularity led the third-generation to open a shop in Mahim in 1829.The shop was registered as `Joshi Budhakaka Mahim Halvawala' by Dhanji Girdhar, the fifth-generation descendant, and was informally known as `Joshi Budhakaka no chokro Dhanji Girdhar Mahim Halvawala, serving eminent British and Indian clients including Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.Kiran holds a letter signed by Nehru which reads: ""We have always been pleased with sweets from Dhanji Girdhar"". He also has a 1950s magazine clipping that quotes Kiran's father, Purushottam Dungarshi Joshi, complaining about heavy taxes and other rules that treat ""sweetmeats"" as ""a luxury meant for the well-to-do"".Now, as then, says Kiran, ""our sweets are consumed by one and all."" The shop's two branches, a 150-year-old one in Tardeo and a 90-year-old one at Dadar Circle, serves mainly Parsis, Maharashtrians and Muslims. ""We even have free deliveries for our privileged Parsi customers in Dadar,"" says Kiran, adding that Parsis are also partial to `sutar feni', `jalebis' and `Mawa Ni Boi'-a sweet shaped like a fish.""You'd be hard-pressed to find something like this now,"" says Kiran, showing off the ornate wooden, fish shaped mould. The shop also prepares a special barfi for the Mahim fair every year.Called 'Urus ki Barfi', the malai confection is fortified with ghee, malai---and faith.""It tastes special because it is sacred,"" says Kiran solemnly.Today the entire Joshi family lives in one building in Mahim. They meet on the shop floor during festivals and also gather for weekly meetings. These gatherings have resulted in innovations like sugar-free anjeer barfis for diabetics, sandwich halva (a jelly-like layer in between two crisp wafers) and triple-flavoured halva.According to Kiran, some truly radical proposals are slated for the upcoming family meeting: introducing chocolate halva and creating a website."

However, the final sanction to the detailed estimate of the project was given on Thursday by minister of railways Suresh Prabhu.The official press statement form public relation office of Central Railway said, ""The section falls in Pune division of Central Railway and passes through Pune, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur districts of Maharashtra. Electrification of this section will provide shorter and seamless movement on electric traction between Western (Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Jaipur, Pune etc.) and Southern (Bengaluru, Chennai) part of the country via Pune-Miraj-Londa-Hospet-Guntakal and Pune-Miraj-Londa-Hubballi-Chikjajur-Bengaluru as these sections are electrified or under electrification.""City-based railway activists and experts termed the development as a big step for Kolhapur.Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) Dhananjay Mahadik said, ""The ministry of railways has fulfilled one of the many demands regarding better rail connectivity for Kolhapur with rest of country. In the rail budget for 2016-17, the rail minister had announced doubling of Miraj-Kolhapur track with electrification. The railway administration has given permission for electrification works. This is first stage of development.""Member of Central Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee Samir Sheth called it major development for passenger and cargo transportation in Kolhapur. ""Lack of electrified rail track from Pune to Kolhapur has slowed down the frequency of trains to Kolhapur. Many trains stop in Pune for changing the engine and it eventually delays the journey. Diesel engines are not as much powerful as electric engines. After electrification speed of all trains will automatically increase.""He added, ""We have already been demanding additional trains for Kolhapur and have already registered our demand for additional trains on Kolhapur-Ahmedabad, Kolhapur-Delhi, Kolhapur-Shirdi and Kolhapur- Mumbai routes.""But the major challenge before railway administration is project deadline. Railway is known for non-compliance of deadlines. Therefore, Railways should instruct PGCIL to comply with the deadline of projects.President of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries Lalit Gandhi said, ""Electrification of Pune-Kolhapur rail track is basic infrastructure work for cargo transportation. It will give boost to sugar and bauxite transportation. At present, sugar from Kolhapur fails to stand in major market due to road transportation and electrification would speed up its transportation."""

In order to draw water from wells and ponds to their farms, the farmers use pumps. Hence, consumption of electricity in these two districts is on the higher side.However, the farmers often fail to pay their electricity bills, affecting MSEDCL's revenue target. An MSEDCL official, on condition of anonymity, said, ""Around 2.75 lakh farmers in Kolhapur zone have defaulted on Rs 400 crore till March 31 this year.

Out of its total geographic area of 7,620 sq km, around 139.11 sq km, which account for 19.35% of the total, are under forest cover. But human intervention in these forest areas has resulted in the man-animal conflicts in the district.V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forests and director of the Sahyadri tiger project, told TOI that Kolhapur is located in the eco-sensitive and biological hotspot of the Western Ghats.""Land development activities in Radhanagari, Aajra and Chandgad talukas have disturbed the migration corridor of the gaurs and elephants. Elephant is a vegetarian animal needs at least 18 hours for feeding. Kolhapur is full of grass crop, sugarcane and water bodies. An elephant gets enough food in single farm, but consumes just 1/3 of the field and destroys the remaining. The individual farmer has to pay a high price,"" he said.The officer explained that the National Forest Policy, 1988 changed the view towards elephants. With it, elephants camps were stopped and people freed the animals in the forest. Since then, they started migration towards northern Karnataka and finally in the Maharashtra via Goa.After 2002, seven elephants made Chandgad, Aajra and Radhanagari talukas as their habitat and they are reluctant to go back on Karnataka due to abundance of food in form of the sugarcane here, the officer said.""We have suggested an alternative crop pattern to keep elephants out of farms. We have proposed cultivation of chilli crop to prevent damage from elephants. We have suggested farmers to change crop patterns to deal with the situation,"" he said. The government has given out Rs 2 crore as compensation to farmers in Kolhapur for crop loss in animal attacks last year.Vivek Patil, a farmer in Here village of Chandgad taluka, said that he lost his entire banana crop due to an elephant attack last year. ""They normally arrive normally between May and September. I only received Rs 12,000 compensation from the government against the actual losses of Rs 80,000. We have demanded solar fencing, digging of ditches around villages to prevent the entry of elephants. But hardly anything has been done,"" he said.Ben said that another native animal of the region, gaur or Indian bison, has been the cause of massive crop damage in Shahuwadi, Chandgad, Panhala, Aajara talukas in the district. ""Gaur is native of Kolhapur district. The grassland where the gaurs inhabited have come under sugarcane cultivation in these talukas. Therefore, the gaurs enter the fields in search of their food,"" he said.Wildlife researcher Amol Jadhav said that increasing human intervention in migration corridors has resulted in to man-animal conflicts. ""Karnataka, Goa, Aajra, Chandgad area is a known elephant migration corridor. They come here in search of food. Farmers have brought jungle land tracts along these corridors and started sugarcane cultivation. Sugarcane has become major source of food for elephants. We don't have permanent solution on migration,"" he said.Officials said that the human deaths were reported in cases of attacks by gaurs or Indian bisons. The animal becomes very aggressive between the period of May to October to protect their young ones. ""The animal would attack any person posing a threat to the newborns. Cattle herding in forest areas has encroached upon the natural grasslands of gaurs. Therefore, the incidents of crop damages have increased in past many years.

In the last two days, the rates have been gone down by Rs300 a quintal to Rs3,700. This cuts the open market rates by over Rs1,300, compared to MSP set at Rs5,050 a quintal.Tur whole purchased from farmers is processed into tur dal in mills. Even as this has left farmers complaining, retailers in the city continue to charge Rs80 to 90 a kg for the tur dal. These rates are pegged at the earlier price of tur whole which was over Rs4,100 a quintal.Private traders are expecting MSP purchases by the National Agriculture Marketing Cooperative Federation (NAFED) will soon end. The procurement was extended by a week recently and the centres are waiting for further extension. Sources said purchases were already shut down in many centres across VidarbhaTur whole rates were around Rs4100 a couple of days ago which have now come down to Rs3700. This is because NAFED purchases are expected to end in next 10 days or so, said a source at Yavatmal , one of the major cultivation centres. The supply is at its peak with nearly 2,500 quintals reaching the agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) yard at Wani taluka here.Hoping to get high rates like the last two years, framers had substantially hiked tur cultivation in Kharif season of 2016. This has, however, led to a glut with farmers claiming to have incurred heavy losses.Kishor Tiwari, director of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), a state government task force on farmers, said many NAFED centres had closed. Orders to extend the purchases till the crop keeps arriving are awaited from the government. The matter has been taken up with the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Payment has been delayed in some centres too, he saidVeteran farm activist Vijay Jawandhia said government intervention was needed. A 10% increase in import duty is not enough and it has to be imposed at 60%, like sugar, he said.Trade sources said all measures to increase tur rates had failed. Last month, stock holdings limits were increased, followed by 10% import duty this year. But after brief spurt the rates had again come down by Rs1000 in a month."

Hence, we are prohibiting the storage and sale of junk food within the school canteen and the school principal and management needs to implement this. Instead of HFSS food, nutritious food needs to be given to students... To make students aware of the nutritious value of food items, local nutritionists and internet should be used by the school,"" the circular said. Pallavi Naik , principal of Dr Kalmadi Shamarao High School , said, ""This is a good move that will help students. When we have food-related discussions in class, students say they love burgers and pizzas. Deep fried stuff and chips are also a big draw. Ordering food from outside has become easier and cafes are opening in every nook and corner. Children are indulging in junk food and coffee at a very young age, which is bad for them.""Rajni B, a parent, said the government's move will help students eat food given in their tiffins. ""Children tend to buy and eat unhealthy stuff instead of home-cooked food. Even if we refuse to give them money, there can always be some children buying junk food which leads to peer pressure. With the state government telling canteens to prohibit junk food and keep only nutritious food, children will have to eat homemade food given in their tiffins. My only concern is how strictly schools will follow it and how strongly it will be enforced by the education department.""Rajiv Yeravdekar , dean, faculty of health and biomedical sciences, Symbiosis International University , and a subject expert, said, "" The term junk food is not defined well. If burgers, French fries and chocolates are considered junk food, what about vadas or sabudana vadas? Taste and peer pressure also need to be considered. If one student chooses healthy food, ten others will choose junk.""More than a ban, health promotion and giving alternative healthy food options is the way to go, Yeravdekar said. ""Students will not want healthy food every day. As adults, we too eat junk food. We need to promote healthy food and give students innovative options like sprouts, chaats or vegetable sandwiches. A calorie count of all junk food items will tell them how much exercise they need to burn those calories. We need to come up with innovative programmes so that students choose healthy food and lifestyle over junk food and inactivity,"" he added."

The State has a total of 1.93 crore family cards or ration cards as they are referred to and consumers use them to draw rice, sugar, dhals, wheat and palm oil, among other items.The Corporation, which has registered the Aadhaar details of 5,81,24,312 consumers, has drawn details including photos and addresses from the Aadhaar database.The source explained that even those families that havent given the Aadhaar details of all their members would get the cards.The names can be added at any time. But we have not reduced the quantity to be given to them. Even now, consumers who have not linked their cards with Aadhaar can do so through our mobile app, tnepds, explained a source.Each smart card would contain 11 parameters, including the photo of the head of the family, name, address and names of family members.It is just a plastic card like any other ID card. There will be no paper inside unlike the ration cards. Information about supplies taken by the families would be sent by text message. That will be their record, explained a source.The drive to link Aadhaar cards with family cards has helped the Corporation to weed out fake cards, said the source, adding they would intimate those who have not integrated Aadhaar details in their system."

Shivajirao Nagawade Patil, president of the federation, reasoned the country will not face any sugar shortage as the crushing season 2017-18 is expected to start in the first week of October.Till Monday, the country produced 147 lakh tonne (lt) of sugar.Watch what else is in the newsSome mills are still operational in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Considering the present trend, the country will produce 215-16 lt of sugar by the end of season. The carry forward stock of last season is 77 lt so the country will have 293-94 lt of sugar stock at its disposal till the next season starts, he said.Even if one takes the national yearly demand as 250 lt, the next season will start with a carry forward stock of 43-44 lt, said Nagawade Patil. The festive season, which starts from the month of October, will also not see any sugar shortage as the crushing season will be starting early. The fresh stock of sugar will be available by October 15, he said.Import of raw sugar, Nagawade Patil said, will not achieve the price parity that the government is looking at but will impact the present prices of sugar in a negative manner. The landing cost of raw sugar at 10 per cent duty will work out to be Rs 38 per kg. Post processing, the ex factory price of the raw sugar will be around Rs 40 per kg and the retail price will be between Rs 42 and Rs 44 per kg, he said. The demand of sugar traders for import duty reduction, he said, will not help the farmers or the millers.Demands of some millers for lowering of import duty of raw sugar and allowing them to treat it during offseason was also not viable according to him. Once the boilers of the mills are switched off, Nagawade Patil said, it will be difficult for them to turn it on before season.Only mills that have crushed to their full capacity will have bagasse to use as fuel in off season. Rest of the mills would have already exhausted their bagasse in running their co-generation plants or as fuel during the season, he said. Most of the mills in Maharashtra had gone for under capacity crushing so barring a handful of private mills none of them have any extra bagasse. On the other hand mills from Uttar Pradesh had gone for full capacity crushing so they will be able to re-ignite their boilers using stored bagasse and process raw sugar, he said.At present, retail price of sugar in India is Rs 42 per kg, which Nagawade Patil said will not rise. We have asked our members to increase sales so that there is no shortage of sugar, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The state government has banned junk food sale in all canteens based on recommendations from the union Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) and has suggested 'healthier' alternatives.Though not many state affiliated schools have canteens, the latest circular from state can be interpreted to include vendors who sell pre-packaged or pre-cooked food items on campus during breaks.Foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar, popularly known in medical jargon by its acronym HFSS, have been struck off the menu by the state citing the danger it poses to kids' health. Sanjay Nagre, a senior education official at Deputy Director of Education (Nagpur) office said, ""It has been proven by research that junk food contain additives that are unhealthy for kids. There are chemicals which are used for preserving food, some for colour and ultimately have a detrimental impact on kids' health."" The state has also directed schools to increase awareness about the problems related with HFSS food.Medical practitioners feel that this decision by state proves that finally physical health is considered part of a child's development. Dr Rajiv Mohta, adolescent counsellor and paediatrician said, ""It is good to know that finally the education department considers physical health, mental health and academics as the triumvirate for a child's overall development. In fact, in their suggested list for beverages they may add ORS for those who take part in sports to take care of the salt loss.""The MWCD had raised concerns over the food consumed by kids and for that formed a committee under Director of National Institute of Nutrition (Hyderabad). The committee came up with various recommendations, among which was suggestions about what the menu in school canteens should be. The committee noted that HFSS food posed a threat to students' health and increased chances of obesity, diabetes, dental and heart problems. The state government had been discussing over the MWCD recommendations and on Monday decided to finally implement it.CBSE was the first to implement this MWCD report and issued directives to all affiliated schools in January 2016 itself. In fact, CBSE had suggested that a School Canteen Management Committee (SCMC) should take charge of menu preparation. CBSE wanted 7-10 members, including teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators to coordinate, implement and monitor the guidelines to make safe food avaialbe to students in schools."

The price of a quintal of joni bella has escalated to Rs. 9,200 from Rs. 2,800 in February, 2016. Joni bella is produced from the native variety of sugarcane, popularly known as kempu kabbu or konanakatte kabbu, under rain-fed method.It is in great demand in urban areas, as it is considered chemical-free. While sulphur phosphate and other chemicals are added to sugarcane juice while producing other varieties of jaggery to give it a bright yellowish colour, joni bella was free of such additions.The area of cultivation of sugarcane in the district has come down to 1,500 hectare in 2016-17 from 4,500 ha. The yield of sugarcane cultivated under rain-fed method is 40 tonne per acre. Around 1.5 quintal of joni bella can be produced from a tonne of sugarcane.Thimmappa Naik, a farmer from Ripponpet, said last year he cultivated kempu kabbu in two acres, but halved it this year. Farmers will not benefit much from escalation in the price of joni bella as there is decline in sugarcane yield owing to moisture stress. The average yield per acre has declined from 40 tonne to 25 tonne in Ripponpet this year, he said.Vinayak Hegde, marketing in charge of Kadamba Marketing Souharda Sahakari Niyamita, a cooperative society in Sirsi, said last year the society sold 3,500 boxes of joni bella each weighing 25 kg. Sales this year is not expected to cross 1,000 boxes, he said."

They were all used in the past.Today, even trenches and solar fencing could not stop the raiders. Trenches got filled up because of lack of maintenance, and solar fences became faulty. Some farmers used direct power supply to these fence, killing elephants, and sometimes human beings.But elephants tore apart such fences, said a former Forest Department official.As elephant migratory corridors became residential areas, and water and fodder became scarce for the animals, they started straying out of forest. Farmers, villagers, and even staff of Forest Department had to stock powerful search lights and firecrackers to scare them away.A change in crop pattern avoiding jack fruit, banana, sugar cane, and maize helped farmers too.At many places, farmers came up with their on innovative solutions to keep wild animals away from agriculture lands.In Kodaikanal, colourful old cloths were used to scare away wild boar and gaur, said K. Kalidasan, president of Osai  an NGO working for wildlife conservation.Some others used sensor-based early warning systems to track elephant movement.Yet others used pebble-filled plastic bottles to create rattling sound when wind blows to scare away the animals.Interestingly, some of the villagers even used FM radio. Bee hives were used along the forest boundaries in the Western Ghats. .At Sirumugai in Coimbatore, farmers use LEDs to scare away wild animals.In Madukkarai, and Kovaipudur herbal solutions are used for the purpose.In Thekkampatti, forest officials are trying hanging solar fences to scare away wild animals."

Based on recommendations the Centre issued over two years ago, the state has told schools not to sell food `High in Fat, Salt and Sugar' (HFSS) and has suggested healthy alternatives. The decision has been taken looking atand related diseases.""HFSS food has very little vitamins and minerals... (Their consumption raises the chance of obesity) and other related diseases among children. The ef fects can be seen on a child's academic performance,"" said the government resolution issued by the school education department. School principals have been asked to ensure that the instructions are followed.The suggested alternatives include chapatis, rice, vegetables and pulses, rajma, wheat upma, khichdi, payasam, idli and vada sambar, coconut water, lemonade and jaljeera. Though not many state-affiliated schools have canteens, the education department's government resolution (GR) banning junk food in schools can be interpreted to include vendors who sell prepackaged or pre-cooked food on campus during breaks.Concerned by food children eat, the Union ministry of women and child development (MWCD) formed a committee under the director of the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad. The panel noted that HFSS (High in Fat, Salt and Sugar) food increased chances of obesity, diabetes, and dental and heart problems.Schools have also been asked toabout healthy eating. ""(They) must take help of professionals in the locality and (seek) information on the internet,"" said the GR.Experts have welcomed the state's move. ""The human body is not designed to metabolise large amounts of artificial sugar and this is easily converted to fat. It is also linked to insulin resistance, which is a precursor to diabetes,"" said Carlyne Remedios, a nutritionist with Saifee Hospital. She said that while it isn't easy to strike the right balance with healthy food, it is not impossible and.""The best way is to make gradual changes so that they are accepted well.""Experts also wished the move had come much earlier.""There was always the science to show that HFSS food had negative health effects on children, and so we should have realized the need for a policy decision two or three years ago,"" said Dr Jagmeet Madan, VP , Indian Dietetic Association.""Nevertheless, it is a welcome step and the least we can do is to minimize the availability of such food to children.

Ibu also practises natural farming at her own garden, where she's aided by her son Nafi, all of 5.Ibu grows a variety of indigenous crops to inspire other farmers to turn organic. ""If a farmer does not follow the three ways of farming  natural, organic and spiritual he will never have a good harvest,"" said Ibu who visited Bengaluru on Tuesday to attend a two-day natural farming summit organized by the Art of Living Foundation.While Ibu learnt natural farming a few years ago from her driver, baby sitter and house assistant, it comes naturally to Nafi. She's proud that he has learnt the tricks of the trade at such a tender age. ""When Nafi was only three months old, some farmers advised me to take him to the fields every morning, saying it was good for health. By the time he was 13 months old, he started watering the plants. Eventually, Nafi started interacting with farmers and learnt how to grow crops.""At Ibu's farm, one can find 129 varieties of edible plants like corn, sorghum, tubers, herbs, spices, fruits and rice in pots. She has another farm (half acre) in Ciawi, 30km from Jakarta, that houses more than 129 varieties of edible plants.""All plants in my garden are grown organically, without using chemicals and fertilizers. We convert our food waste into compost and use that as fertilizer. Unused, rotten food makes for good fertilizer as well. My son helps me in pulling out insects, if any,"" added Ibu.Her firm, Javara Indegenous Indonesia, manufactures coconut chips, jam, sugar and many more products from indigenous crops, thereby creating a supply chain for farmers in the market. ""At present, we are partnering with 52,000 farmers and cultivate around 1,100 varieties of indigenous rice,"" she said.Ibu also spoke about how she took to natural farming and inspired several other indigenous farmers in Indonesia to follow suit."

The decision of toll collection is not mine, he said.Though there was staff shortage, Udupi district had topped the State in the implementation of the Bhoomi scheme. I was able to perform well only because of the cooperation of all officers and staff in the district, Mr. Venkatesh said.In her felicitation address, Priyanka Mary Francis, Deputy Commissioner, said that Mr. Venkatesh had a deep knowledge about matters relating to the Revenue Department. He worked with equanimity and did not succumb to any pressure. He followed rules and regulations in his decisions. This would be an inspiration to all officers, she said.G. Anuradha, Additional Deputy Commissioner, said that during his short tenure, Mr. Venkatesh had cleared encroachments on 152 acres of land. He had given his nod in 469 cases of land conversion. Nearly 99 per cent of cases in the District Magistrates court had been disposed of.Sheela K.

5922dde97be9e01fc006f9a6,Sugar versus candy is a bitter American battle,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sugar-versus-candy-is-a-bitter-american-battle/article17895941.ece,2017-04-09,"Candy and sugar have never been friends in Americas policy-making battles, but these days, their rivalry has turned even bitter. The American sugar lobby and the candy manufacturers are both trying to convince the Trump administration and Congress of their respective points of view. The candy industry says government regulations do not allow a free market for sugar, and American sugar policy is tilted to protect the vested interests of about 18,000 sugarcane and sugar beet growers. The sugar lobby says the candy makers are greedy.Americans eat chocolates and candies worth $35 billion every year. Hershey leads the confectionery market with 31% share. By restricting imports and the amount of sugar produced and sold in the U.S., the government seeks to avoid its oversupply or shortage. Every year, the Department of Agriculture forecasts sugar consumption and trade and sets production quotas. The candy lobby  which even has a Candy Political Action Committee to raise money for favourite politicians  says this policy damages the industry and consumers.Large confectioners have nothing to complain about. They pay less for sugar than their counterparts in other developed countries and have boosted profits under the current sugar policy, says the Sugar Alliance. According to the group, sugar prices are as low today as they were 30 years ago and it accuses candy makers of hiking prices by 300% over that time. Food manufacturers pocket the windfall from falling sugar prices instead of sharing the savings with consumers, the sugar lobby says and points out that the confectioners boast of higher profit margins than hospitals, defence contractors, and even Hollywood. Candy makers have announced over 100 major expansion projects since 2012.The candy lobby has its own statistics to counter the sugar lobby. According to the National Confectioners Association (NCA), the governments support to sugar costs U.S. consumers and businesses up to $3.5 billion annually and will cost taxpayers $115 million over the next 10 years. There are 6,00,000 people employed in direct manufacturing in the sugar-using industry that are negatively impacted by this programme and 18,000 growers that are benefiting, it argues, and calculates that 10,000 jobs per year in the U.S. food industry are lost due to government support for the sugar lobby. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that for every one sugar-growing job saved by high U.S. sugar prices, approximately three American manufacturing jobs are lost.Ethical questionsThe NCA held a conference at a Trump property in Florida in early March and three more of their meetings will be held at hotels owned by the Presidents family, raising yet another ethical controversy. The group says the bookings were made much before Donald Trump won the presidency, but it hopes to create a favourable environment for the industry under the new dispensation. The sugar lobby is determined to resist it. Testifying before a Congressional committee on Tuesday, a representative of the Sugar Alliance sought further protection from Mexican sugar import. He also accused India of subsiding sugar production. It is not that the candy makers and sugar makers are never on the same page. Americans consume more than twice the recommended amount of added sugar intake, and this is linked to a wide range of health issues in the country. Opposition to public policy initiatives to reduce sugar intake is one topic that unites sugar producers and sugar buying industries.By restricting imports and domestic production of sugar, the U.S. government seeks to avoid its oversupply or shortage, something which the candy industry opposes"

A teetotaller, he hardly parties and mostly sticks to his trademark white, cotton half sleeves shirts in office instead of business suits.The only touches of flamboyance about him during his IIM-B days were his Enfield Bullet motorcycle, which he would take around the city, and his unwavering admiration for former cricketer Krish Srikkanth who was a former collegemate of KK, said Shashi Kalathil, one of KK's IIM-B batchmates who is a marketing consultant now.But he is effective. ""While he may not be as flashy as a typical cola head, he's done an exceptional job with market execution at Coca-Cola in the last few years,"" said Kalathil, a former PepsiCo marketing head. Known as a stickler for time, KK has had the longest stint at Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages as chief executive, a post he held since 2010.With Coca-Cola for the past 13 years, he's previously worked with Asian Paints, Murugappa group's electronics and confectionery brands, and consumer goods maker Henkel, across functions including sales, market research and general management. He will need to draw from all his experiences to put Coca-Cola back on growth track. While India is a top six critical market for the Atlanta-based multinational, slowing single-digit decline in sales volumes, consumers changing preferences to healthy drinks and smaller packs, and multiple taxation within the category including a potential sugar tax have all had the beverage maker grappling for growth in the country.KK's elevation comes at a time when the beverage maker's global leadership has also changed, with James Quincey replacing Muhtar Kent as CEO on May 1. While announcing the changes in Indian leadership, James Murphy, president for Asia Pacific Group at Coca-Cola, had said, ""The Coca-Cola Company is designing a new operating model to support the next stage of transformation into a growth-oriented, consumer-centred, total beverage company.""KK's first town hall with Coca-Cola India employees was much on those lines."

Khader said here on Thursday that it appears that the Union government has decided to cut its subsidy grant to sugar supplied to people through public distribution system (PDS).Addressing presspersons, the Minister said that the Union government in its 2017-18 budget has not mentioned about continuing the subsidy grant to the States for supplying sugar under PDS. It has not reserved funds for such supply under the respective head of account. Hence, the State government has written to the Union government urging it not to cut grants.The Minister said that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has approved a proposal of giving one litre kerosene to those people in Malnad and coastal rural areas even though they had cooking gas (LPG) connection. It is not applicable to those living in the urban areas. Those interested in availing of the facility in rural areas would have to indicate their willingness by submitting applications to the gram panchayats.He said that PDS coupons would be made available to consumers through fair price shops. The fair price shops would get Rs. 10 per coupon as incentive. The government has plans to convert the fair price shops as seva kendras."

Although a rate hasn't been specified, it would bring almost all processed food items under the ambit of the proposed levy if implemented. Some companies were skeptical about the move.""Like cigarettes, consumers who want to consume such products will continue doing it in one form or another,"" said BK Rao, deputy marketing manager of Parle Products, which sells biscuits and snacks. ""If implemented, prices will shoot up and manufacturers will pass it on to consumers. This might lead to some consumers refraining from the brand. However, when the mandate comes, we will fine tune it (reformulate the product) according to the law,"" he added.The product list includes deep fried Indian and western snacks, desserts and confectioneries that are sweet, fatty and salty, items such as burgers, noodles, sauces, coffee, baby products, sweetened beverages and juices.""Noodles don't come under junk food. They have low calorie content with just 1.5 calorie per gram. Everything instant isn't junk,"" said a top official of a company that sells instant noodles. ""In other countries, wherever there is this guideline, we are not included.""The regulator's notification is based on the recommendations of an 11-member expert group set up by the FSSAI after a Delhi High Court order in 2015. The move is expected to reduce the number of cases of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, especially among children. The regulator also proposed strict labelling norms for such products and a bar on advertising them on children's television channels.""We have shared the proposal with the ministry. Specific recommendations will require different ways of implementation, for example, on ban of advertising, consideration from the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting,"" said Pawan Agarwal, CEO of FSSAI. ""On some matters, we will ourselves take action.""Restaurants said to make India healthy, consumers must be educated, health products should be subsidised and harmful ingredients should be banned.""Efficacy of the proposal is the concern. Instead, subsidies should be given to healthy food products,"" said Riyaz Amlani, president of the National Restaurant Association of India , which represents chains such as McDonald 's, Pizza Hut, KFC, Cafe Coffee Day, Taco Bell and Subway . ""Raising taxes won't stop consumers from indulgence and the weight of this will fall on organised players. We will express our concerns.""Fat tax on junk food, a reality in European countries such as Denmark and Hungary, found its way into India in June last year when the Kerala government proposed a 14.5% tax on burgers, pizzas and other junk food served in branded restaurants.""The proposed tax means that people who have money can afford to be unhealthy,"" said Ashish Saxena, CEO of Chili's American Grill & Bar (south & west). ""They should ban the ingredients which are harmful like the US did with trans-fat and Europe with high sodium levels, instead of levying additional tax, which becomes more grey and murky for the industry.""Not all are complaining about the proposal.""We fully support FSSAI's work on promoting safe and nutritious food for Indian consumers,"" said an official spokesperson of Hindustan Unilever, which sells products such as Bru coffee and Magnum ice-cream. ""We have the responsibility to contribute to this cause both through our product formulation and product labelling to help consumers make informed choices.""Modern Food Enterprises recently relaunched its bread portfolio with multigrain and multi-vitamin variants. ""This is exactly where our relaunch works beautifully as health and wellness was our fundamental brief to our research and development unit six months ago,"" said Aseem Soni, CEO of Modern Food."
5922dfc07be9e01fc006fae9,"In Azamgarh, SP on a sticky wicket",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-azamgarh-sp-on-a-sticky-wicket/article17374056.ece,2017-02-27,"Ground work:Preparations under way at the venue of an election meeting by BSP chief Mayawati at Rani ki Sarai in the Azamgarh Sadar constituency on Sunday.Rajeev BhattIn 2012, a civil services trainer Shujauddin voted for the Samajwadi Party as he believed it was sympathetic to Muslims. This time, however, he has no qualms about declaring that he was going to vote for the BSP.If Shujauddin is peeved at the veteran SP MLA (from Nizamabad) Alam Badi after the Muzafarrnagar riots, his larger resentment stems from the failure of the Akhilesh Yadav government to deliver on the promises it made to Muslims. From 2012 to 2017, all we saw were internal fights, riots and law and order problems. Lets give the BSP a chance, says Shujauddin.Shujauddin hails from Shanjarpur, which gained notoriety after two youth from the village were shot dead in the Balta House encounter in 2008. Over the years, the village has seen many local youth being accused of terror activities.Today, a talking point of the village is the failure of the SP government to release innocent Muslim youth lodged in jail on false terror charges, as promised by Mulayam Singh in his party manifesto. Instead, they went to court and challenged the acquittals, says Tariq Shafique, an activist. The SP boasts that it started a new sugar mill in Azamgarh, but not a single Yadav has got a job there yet. Shafique too has shifted loyalty to the BSP.Like many Muslims here, Shafique prefers to the vote for the BSPs candidate Chandradev Yadav, rather than the sitting SP MLA and fellow Muslim Alam Badi. In the last elections, the SP registered a thumping win in Azamgarh district, securing nine of the 10 seats. If the BSP is posing a tough challenge to it in Nizamabad, the SP is on a sticky wicket this time in many other seats as well.Azamgarh is the Lok Sabha constituency of Mulayam Singh. Apart from prestige, the SPs Muslim-Yadav samikaran or equation will also be put to test.In the Phoolpur-Pawai seat, the BSPs Abul Kais Azami, who emerged second in the last elections, appears to be in a strong position this time. If the SP is hoping to consolidate its margin after its alliance with the Congress, the BSP has got a fillip with a regional outfit Rashtriya Ulema Council (RUC) extending support. In the last election, the RUC got around 8,000 votes in Phoolpur-Pawai and over 1.55 lakh votes in the 64 seats it contested. RUC president Maulana Aamir Rashadi has raised the pitch against the SP and is holding several meetings daily to draw Muslims to the BSP. Our slogan is UP ko yeh baat pasand hai. Dalit Muslim ka saath pasand hai . With our support, the BSP will rout the SP in Purvanchal, says Mr. Rashadi, who unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections against Mulayam Singh in 2014. The BJP, which stood fourth here last time, looks set to make a big jump this time with the nomination of Arun Yadav, son of Yadav strongman and former Azamgarh MP Ramakant Yadav.Swing factorAnother factor that could work in favour of the BSP is its induction of tainted MLA Mukhtar Ansari and his family. The Ansaris have immense clout, especially among the poor and Muslims, in Mau, Ghazipur,Ballia and parts of Azamgarh.In the Gopalpur seat, the SP again faces a tricky situation. The party candidate here is Nafees Ahmed. The sitting MLA and Minister Waseem Ahmed was denied ticket, sources say, due to his proximity to Shivpal Yadav and his rivalry with SP leader Abu Azmi. The BSPs Kamla Prasad Yadav hopes to make a difference here with the support of the RUC and QED, which together got 13,000 votes in Gopalpur last time.In Atrauliya, Sangram Yadav, sitting MLA and son of senior Minister Balram Yadav, is facing a tough challenge from the BJPs Kanhaiya Lal, a Nishad, and BSPs Akhand Pratap Singh, a Thakur. The BJP is looking to corner Mr. Sangram by consolidating non-Yadav backward votes. Balram Yadavs family has won here many times. Now people are looking for a change, says Anil Yadav, a research scholar doing field-work in Azamgarh.In Didarganj, veteran former BSP MLA seems to be in a strong position to defeat the SP. He lost the last election by a paltry 2000 votes. He is in a stronger position now with the backing of the RUC, which secured a game-changing 34000 votes in this seat last time.In Sagri too, the BSPs Vandana Singh, a Thakur, appears solid as she has the sympathy factor after the murder of her husband Sarvesh Singh Sipu in 2013. Vandana is among the three Thakurs fielded by the BSP in Azamgarh as it looks to cash in on the Thakur-Yadav polarisation. The Thakurs also fear they are losing the lead in Azamgarh, said a local scribe."

""Now, she is less enthusiastic about resuming school,"" says her mother Tina.Preetha Sharma, a 12-year-old student, echoes Alisha's sentiments. ""I usually buy vada pav, chips and chocolates almost thrice a week from the canteen . I will miss eating all these items if they ban it. Though I carry lunch from home, I love eating fast food during the short break. All my friends do it, too. My parents tell me about the ill-effects of eating junk food , and it's only at school that I have it. Once I reach home, I anyway drink milk and then eat fruits in the evening, followed by dinner. So why can't I have my favourite foods once in a while at school?"" she asks.Alisha and Preetha are among the many kids in the city who are upset about the ban, which came into effect after the Maharashtra government issued a Government Resolution (GR) on Monday, asking schools not to sell items that are 'High in Fat, Salt and Sugar' (HFSS).Now that items like potato chips, noodles, aerated drinks, pizzas, burgers, cakes, biscuits, buns and pastries might no longer feature on canteen menus, parents are happy that this will keep childhood obesity and other related disorders in check. Arundhati Chavan, president of Parents Teacher Association (PTA), shares, ""We've been fighting for this for the last five years. While some schools anyway don't encourage sale of junk food and have their own midday meal programmes, others instruct parents on what they need to pack for tiffins. Some parents do give their kids snacks like noodles and wafers in their dabbas, but that's only when the children throw a tantrum. We don't recommend junk food because kids tend to feel hungry soon after consuming it and lose concentration as well.""There are some parents who believe that despite the ban, kids will eat junk food outside the premises. Radhika Kochhar, mother of a 13-year-old boy, shares, ""Kids may be forced to eat healthier items in school from now on, but when they step out of the premises, they will buy junk food from vendors. So, how do we control that?""Anushka Desai, teacher at a suburban school, adds that it's not just school authorities who are responsible for what kids eat. Parents, too, need to be strict when it comes to their diet. After all, the GR does not stop children from carrying junk food in their lunch boxes. She says, ""Parents should resist giving in to the demands of kids and try to limit intake of unhealthy food items even at home. They can control consumption of junk food by ensuring that the kids have a balanced, nutritious diet throughout the week  be it at home or in school. Kids can be allowed to indulge in their favourite food items once a week. They need to be taught why junk food is called 'junk' and emphasise on the unhealthy aspects of it. If they start at an early age, it is easier for kids to make correct food choices.""Dietician and sports nutritionist Sakina Patrawala believes banning all junk items from the canteen is not the solution. ""Schools need to get a nutritionist on board to review the canteen menu and make healthier changes without compromising on the taste. This will help improve the quality of food served at the canteen. The school also has to ensure complete hygiene among canteen staff and also in the premises. Also, seminars on health need to be regularly organised for children as well as parents so that they can learn about healthy eating habits.""Nisha Ranganathan, mother of a teenager, adds, ""While I believe that the ban is a first step in the right direction, parents and school authorities should come together to ensure kids eat healthy. I think seminars and talk sessions on food habits must be made compulsory. Also, make healthy meals interesting for kids by presenting them in innovative ways.""> Instead of maida in frankies, use whole wheat to make the rolls.

The prices of green leafy vegetables have also gone up by 50 % and it is likely to escalate further by at least 50 % during the next fortnight, as indicated by vendors at Kaktives and Shaniwarkoot on Sunday. The increase in the prices of vegetables, which was bound to shoot up every passing week owing to shortage of water on account of the summer conditions and a third year of drought in the district, has hit hard families in the lower income group and the middle class. These sections have already been hit by steep increase in the prices of pulses and foodgrains, sugar and other commodities during the last two years. These families are now forced to cut down their consumption by half.A buyer said that he used to buy a kg of tomatoes once in three or four days till recently but is now buying only half a kilogram.He said that as the prices are bound to shoot up further very soon, we have to cut down our consumption further and need to be more economical while buying vegetables till the monsoon sets in and prices start falling.Vendors said that the prices were shooting up due to a fall in production in view of shortage of water, leading to a decline in arrivals in the wholesale markets.Meanwhile, a substantial stock of vegetables from the district went to Goa every day. Apparently, the typical demand-supply gap was growing and it would keep growing for at least three more months."

Political experts said the development might also be a signal of Mayawati's return to her core 'Bahujan' plank even as she prepares herself for an alliance with the Congress and SP to take on the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.Mayawati had reportedly been considering strong action against Siddiqui for his apparent failure in mobilising Muslim voters in favour of BSP, specially in communally sensitive west UP, where she had given the maximum number of tickets to Muslim candidates.The first sign of Siddiqui coming in the cross-hairs of Mayawati appeared this year on Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14. During a rally in Lucknow, the BSP boss openly held Siddiqui responsible for alleged anomalies in the sale of sugar mills during her previous regime. Mayawati did not stop here, she went on to say that she would ""not allow UP to become a Pakistan"".Sources said Mayawati's decision was driven by protest by BSP workers, especially the Dalit cadre, which has been accusing Siddiqui of selling party tickets to rich candidates while ignoring the winnable ones. Last month, Mayawati had shunted Siddiqui out of UP to look after party affairs in Madhya Pradesh.The BSP boss has since been focusing on consolidation of Dalits and Most Backward Castes.""She focused too much on Muslims who came from more socially and economically influential backgrounds. That did not go well with the backward Muslims,"" said political commentator and Dalit ideologue SR Darapuri."

Talking to reporters on the TU campus here on Sunday, he alleged that during the Congress regime in the State, so many irregularities in appointments were made that the party leaders have no moral right to question the TRS and its leaders. As a student wing leader, I would like to challenge the Congress leaders to an open discussion, he said.Pradeep said that the previous regimes with a planned programme weakened the Nizam Sugar Factory at Bodhan and the Nizamabad Cooperative Sugar Factory at Sarangapur and are now trying to pass the buck on to the present political dispensation. Congress leaders while being unable to digest the welfare programmes being introduced and implemented by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao are indulging in mudslinging, he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself showered praises on the TRS Government and its leadership for the perfect execution of welfare and development programmes, he added."

He lives in the city and grows his own coffee. Yes, you read that right. He does. Belmar and his family offer proof that coffee is not only grown in Chikkamagaluru and Kodagu, but also right here in our city.The businessman has been growing coffee in the face of scorching summers or water scarcity . ""Bengaluru is 900mt above sea level and the land can be utilised for coffee. But one needs to grow it properly in the shade,"" he explains.When Bangalore Mirror visited his 3,000 sq ft coffee plantation, it felt like a forest in the middle of the concrete hub.""Years ago, T Dasarahalli was away from the city. Just about 100 people lived here and we had only one bus to our house from City Market. My father used to love plants and we grew everything on our land. Not just variety of trees and plants, we also had many cows which used to give us 200-300 lt of milk. We used to share it with whoever came to our home,"" Belmar says.The grand old times are gone, but the family continues its green tradition. They keep bees and harvest honey too on their property.However, Belmar, remembers a time when they just had to dig up to half a foot to find water. ""That is how we were able to grow ginger, grapes, vegetables, paddy, wheat, sugarcane, betel, pepper and other plants,"" he said.On how they started growing coffee, Belmar's explanation is simple - Everyone in the family loves coffee and wanted to taste the authentic thing. ""We used to have our own cows and buffaloes for milk and grow sugarcane for jaggery and sugar. Why then, can we not have our own coffee plants, we thought. Then we went to Chikkamagaluru in search of the plants.""Though they were unsure if coffee plants can survive in Bengaluru, they kept going with their plan. ""Today we have around 50 plants,"" he says. ""We had other bigger trees on the land. Coffee grows in semi-shade so we put them between these big trees. We watered the plants continuously and saw the first flowers on the plants,"" he says.He recalls that his father had tears in his eyes when he saw the coffee plant flowering at last.""Each coffee plant gives around 2-3kg of coffee fruit. In a year, we get close to 50 kg. We pluck the fruit and clean it and keep it for drying. Once it has dried properly, we give it for processing and get it done in a customised manner. We tell them whether we want it with or without chicory,"" he said.His friends and family, who visit the farm, are in awe of the plantation. ""My friends used to ask me if I were living in Madikeri or Bengaluru. They love the coffee we give them in packets. People who visit us from abroad wait to visit again to refill their stock,"" he said.Belmar also grows the cocoa plant. He has close to 150 cocoa plants, the seeds of which he sends to Mangaluru for processing.""We drink premium coffee personally handled by us. It is better than the coffee grown in Chikkamagaluru,"" he says, with a hint of pride.Belmar says they started keeping bees as his grandfather was one of the founders of the Bee-keepers Association in the city. ""We have been harvesting honey on our land for the past 40-50 years. Keeping bees easy here because of the rich bio-diversity.""Bee-keeping in the city dates to the times the British were here. Belmar says, ""It was during the British rule that the Bee-keepers Association began. These days, people are trained to keep bees and harvest honey.""He has one special information about the honey. ""When the Neem tree is flowering, the honey tastes best and it is clear. In the mango season, the honey is quite reddish and very sweet. When the tamarind tree is flowering, honey is a little sour. For each season, we have a different flavour of honey."""

""The project was sanctioned during 2015-2016 fiscal and railways had allocated adequate funds to complete it on priority basis,"" he said, adding Bihar has got about Rs 3,696 crore share in the current general Budget to carry out various development works of railways.The minister said the Kiul-Gaya route passes through four districts of Bihar - Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Nawada and Gaya - and the railways will build 22 big and 25 small bridges while completing track doubling work on the route.He also announced the electrification of the railway route between Tilaiya (Hisua) and Kiul stations. He said the railway electrification work between Tilaiya and Kiul (87km) will be completed at an expenditure of about Rs 100 crore. Electrification work will help railways run faster passenger and goods trains on the route,"" he said.Sinha, who also holds the charge of Union communications minister, launched the linking of nine panchayats under Narhat block with 3G services via remote on Thursday.Railway sources said the then railway minister Nitish Kumar had also announced the doubling of the Gaya-Kiul railway route during his visit in 2001 to Tilaiya station (now a junction). Nitish had then inaugurated the Koderma-Tilaiya-Rajgir route to enable the running of freight trains in order to shorten the route of coal delivery to the power plant of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) at Barh. But the doubling of the Gaya-Kiul tracks never took off.Sinha was accompanied by Nawada BJP MP and Union state minster for micro and small industries Giriraj Singh and LJP MP Chirag Paswan.Hisua BJP MLA Anil Singh requested Sinha to link Pawapuri railway station in Nalanda district with Nawada railway station so as to facilitate the people to reach Patna and New Delhi from Nawada. Presently, only two express trains - Gaya-Howrah Express (daily) and Kamakhya Express to Assam (biweekly) - run on the Gaya-Kiul loop line. The doubling is expected to provide a major boost to industrial development in Nawada which does not have even a single industrial unit left following the closure of Mohini Sugar Mill at Warisaliganj in 1993.Railway Board member A K Mittal, ECR GM D K Gayen, Danapur DRM R K Jha and many other senior railway officials were present on the occasion."

He further argued that in the agreement, which would continue till December 4, 2027, there were some provisions as per which PSPCL had to make advance payments to the company after some discount.The court was informed that the power minister had full control over PSPCL. It was submitted that few days back, Rana Gurjit had made a public statement of reviewing agreements with private power generating companies in the state. The petitioner made the submission that a situation of conflict of interest has arisen and thus minister's portfolio should be changed. Else he should be directed to dispose off all shares held by him and his spouse in Rana Sugars Limited.Though the advocate general tried to submit that there was no conflict of interest as PSPCL was under the Electricity Regulatory Authority, the petitioner countered stating that as the power minister was going to review its agreements with private power suppliers, his own company was among those firms.

For, a family elder, had persuaded him to meet Ramakrishna by saying the priest distributed the sweet amongst those who went to meet him. It is entirely possible that Naren, as he was known then, went more because of the rasogolla than Ramakrishna.Mani Shankar Mukherjee  or Shankar, as most of us know him as  has this and hundreds of such priceless nuggets of information in a new book on Swami Vivekananda. 'Ahaare Anahaare Vivekananda', as the name suggests, examines the spiritual life of the monk in a hitherto little-explored light  through his love of, almost bordering on obsession for, food.""In my journey through Swamiji's palate, I have actually been able to map several spiritual landmarks of his life,"" laughs the author when the spirituality-food connection is remarked upon, and recounts the rasagolla story. ""Again,"" he says, ""it was severe stomach ailment that kept bothering Swamiji's general health, especially after he left his mother's care and accepted sanyas at the age of 23. But this proved to be a boon in the larger sense. He had to travel first class both on train and ship so that he could access the toilet at peace. So he rubbed shoulders with the elite. On one such trip he met JRD Tata and told him not to depend on foreign products but start manufacturing steel in India itself. Later, he even advised him to start a science learning institute of excellence and IISc Bangalore was born.""Many other fascinating nuggets emerge. Though it is commonly known that Swamiji loved to eat fowl cutlet from Chacha's Hotel next to his ancestral house on Shimla Street, it was Peeru Hotel, again not too far away, where he was a regular customer. ""He probably got this from his father, who got a Muslim cook to instruct cooks at home how to prepare non-vegetarian dishes. Soon, with his young friends, Swamiji started the Greedy Club at home to experiment with food. What's more, the first item that he ever bought by saving up his pocket money was an encyclopaedia of French cooking,"" the author mentions in the book.And because the monk loved cooking and feeding people as much as he loved eating, he did quite a lot to popularize Indian cuisine wherever he went and with whomever he met. This penchant for cooking and feeding people went on unabated through early monkhood and even when he went abroad to tour the US and the UK. ""Just as he spread Vedanta among foreigners, he started making Indian cuisine popular too. He used to offer to cook Indian meals in the kitchens of whoever offered to host him during his long years of stay abroad. Cooking excited him so much that he decided to start a home delivery service in 1896. He was perhaps the first Indian to think of this kind of startup,"" Shankar says.In fact, Vivekananda's mortar and pestle, Indian spices and a liberal ration of cooking ingredients followed him wherever he went. He used to telegram the other monks at the Ramakrishna Mission to replenish his supplies whenever he ran out. ""Once he had asked for sona moong dal to be sent to him urgently because his khichudi had become a hit with his hosts. The monks roasted the entire supply of moong dal and sent it to him. He was so angry that he sent back a volley of verbal abuse, saying roasted moong dal spoils easily,"" Shankar says from his book.Vivekananda also loved spicy food and used to pep up everything he ate with a dash of green chilli. He missed this abroad, and his hosts tried their best to get some for him whenever they could. Once, in 1896, a host in England paid three shillings to buy just three green chillies for him, which he devoured in one go. ""Just as he loved the heat of spice, he loved the chill of ice-cream too and devised his own recipe. He would add sugar and crushed ice to scraped coconut and relish it. Was it his sweet tooth that finally led to diabetes or whether it was hereditary is not known, but both blood sugar and high blood pressure were added to his chronic stomach ailments to make life miserable for him. Towards the end, he even lost his eyesight because of diabetes. Unfortunately, insulin had not been invented then,"" Shankar rues. However, two of his brothers who outlived him and offered valuable insights into his life through their writings, lived to be over 80. Shankar met both of them and collected valuable information from them about Swamiji.Some of Vivekananda's critics used to pounce upon the fact that he ate non-vegetarian food abroad, something they considered ""sacrilege"" for a monk. ""Ask them to send me a cook and ingredients that can help cook food that they think is suitable for a monk. I don't think there can be any restriction on the food that a monk can have. In a foreign country, I have to eat what my hosts eat, no matter what the pundits at home say. I have allowed my fellow monks of the RKM order to have any kind of food they want. I don't want to impose vegetarianism on anyone but at the same time I must emphasise the benefits of a vegetarian diet. Give me khara (drumsticks) and I can walk any length of the earth to chew them,"" Swamiji had said.A lot of dust is often kicked up over whether Vivekananda had tasted beef or not. Reams have been written for and against it. ""There is no absolute proof on this,"" Shankar says. ""While he had said that he would gratefully eat whatever his hosts would prepare for him abroad, which might mean that he tasted all kinds of meat that foreigners have most naturally, on the other hand, he denied having had steak after his lecture at Chicago, though a monk of another religion who had travelled with him alleged that he had ordered steak after the speakers met at the basement for refreshments. Steak in America those days obviously meant beef steak.""But fish he loved, and of the many varieties he had, Hilsa was his favourite like a true-blue Bengali. Once, while on a steamer crossing over to Narayanganj, now in Bangladesh, he bought 20 Hilsas so that not he alone but even the boatmen could have a feast. But as the fish were getting cooked, he realised that he salivated for hilsa head cooked with pui shaak, a traditional Bengali delicacy. So he got off the steamer midstream, arranged for a smaller boat, went to the bank, disembarked, looked for pui shaak everywhere and finally managed to get some from a farmer who gave it to him in exchange for diksha, according to a nugget from the book. ""He bought 20 Hilsas for Re 1. That was in 1897, and can be easily used as an inflation index,"" Shankar says.""You cannot separate food from Vivekananda,"" says the author. ""In fact, if you have to appreciate his philosophy, you have to understand the gastronome in him that loved to eat and feed and experiment with food. I personally believe that food was his other mission in life, if not the most important one. It lorded over other topics in most of his letters and other pieces that he wrote himself and in what others wrote about him. Though we have access to many of these documents, there's much that is lost, and I will strive to discover them. His correspondences with his mother, for example, can throw open another unknown world of the Swamiji who never fails to inspire,"" Shankar signs off."

Officials and traders attributed the significant jump in sales to the good monsoon crop and high rates offered for cane by sugar mills.Large tracts of land in Kolhapur are under sugar cane cultivation, earning it the tag of being the sugar bowl of Maharashtra.

VenkatachalapathyToday, it is vilified as an invasive tree that causes enormous damage to the environment and inhibits the growth of indigenous plants. But in the early 1960s, when Tamil Nadu was reeling under a severe shortage of firewood and the issue even triggered a debate in the Legislative Assembly, prosopis Juliflora , known as seemai karuvelam , was seen as a saviour to overcome this shortage. It even earned the sobriquet panjam thaangi (providing succour during famine) .The then Congress government, led by Chief Minister Kamaraj, made arrangements for aerial seeding of the plant from a helicopter in Ramanathapuram district. The authorities in other districts advised people to plant the tree in poromboke land, tank bunds and natham land to overcome the firewood shortage. The tree was also used to erect fences, making it difficult for animals to invade agricultural fields.With cooking gas and kerosene replacing firewood even in remote villages, the role of seemai karuvelam as a provider of firewood has almost come to an end. But, the tree has entrenched itself in the soil, spreading its roots like the tentacles of a mythical animal.The Jamaican connectionThough the plant gained popularity in the 1960s, seemai karuvelam actually arrived almost a century ago. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, Lt. Col. R.H. Bendome, Conservator of Forests of Northern circle (Madras), was responsible for its introduction. He had requested the Secretary of the Revenue department of Madras to supply seeds of the plant for planting in arid tracts of South India in 1876.The seeds were received from Jamaica and sown in South India during 1877.Even in 1953, the Fodder and Grazing Committee of Madras decided to grow seemai karuvelam on a large scale on the slopes of barren hills and panchayat forests to augment fuel supply. In fact, The Hindu archives have an advertisement placed by a nursery in T. Nagar selling the trees seeds.While various species of Prosopis were introduced at the time, P. juliflora has spread over large areas and has naturalised in most of the arid and semi-arid regions of India. P. juliflora has survived where other tree species have failed, and in many cases, become a major nuisance. It has invaded, and continues to invade, millions of hectares of rangeland in South Africa, East Africa, Australia and coastal Asia. In 2004, it was rated one of the worlds top 100 least wanted species (Invasive Species Specialist Group of the IUCN, 2004), wrote V. Nandagopalan, A. Doss and S.P. Anand of the PG and Research Department of Botany, National College in Tiruchi, in an article published in 2014 by the International Journal of Phytotherapy .Preferred food for faunaDispersal of the species is mainly through animals by endozoochory (dispersal via ingestion by vertebrate animals). The pods are succulent and are a preferred choice of food for animals.The FAO has reported that initially, the plant was observed to occur in areas of 150-750 mm annual rainfall. However, invasions have been recorded in large ricegrowing stretches of Cauvery River Delta in Tamil Nadu State with mean annual rainfall of 1500 mm and where the occurrence of floods and inundation are common, it adds.The researchers of the National College, who had carried out their field study in Pudukkottai district, explained that an injury from the thorn of the species would not heal easily despite intensive medical treatments, and using the wood in a fireplace could also cause dermatitis. They also pointed to the available reports on cattle toxicity.According to reports by local afar pastoralists, the ingestion of the pod over long periods of time will result in death of cattle. Stomach poisoning by the pod may induce a permanent impairment of the ability to digest cellulose. This might be due to the high sugar content of the pod that depresses the rumen bacterial cellulose activity, and finally kills the animal, they said."

The recovery followed a quarter of muted sales due to the currency swap in November that had curtailed the purchasing power of rural households using cash to buy shampoos, soaps, or packaged cookies.The overall market grew 12.2% by value in the fourth quarter with 7.5% volume growth, according to executives citing Nielsen data.""Consumption is clearly recovering and is expected to continue to strengthen across the balance of the year,"" Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive, said on an investor call last Friday, adding that India's urban consumption is back to normal but the wholesale channel has not completely bounced back in rural areas due to a lag effect.Unilever, the parent of consumer products company Hindustan Unilever , said about two weeks ago that growth in India had recovered from the uncertainty experienced due to the currency swap.So far, two listed companies -- Dabur and Marico -- have posted quarterly earnings with positive commentary on demand revival. Dabur said sales improved as the quarter progressed, led by a significant improvement in rural demand that accounted for more than half its sales. Volume swelled 2.4%.""Liquidity has come back and rural demand is looking positive. It should further accelerate over the next two quarters on the back of a good monsoon as is the expectation. We are moving more stocks in the wholesale channel,"" said Dabur chief executive Sunil Duggal.Marico, which posted 10% volume growth, also said normalcy has returned.Growth, however, wasn't entirely driven by volumes or actual products in shopping carts. Last quarter also saw companies including Britannia, Hindustan Unilever, Amul, Dabur and Parle either raising prices or cutting pack weights after prices of ingredients such as sugar, milk powder and palm oil jumped 20-80% over the past year on account of fluctuating global commodity prices and lower production cycles.Also, while listed companies have been posting lower value growth numbers, Nielsen said the market's expansion has been fueled by smaller companies.""Small and regional players have seen much faster growth than top manufacturers in recent quarters. As an example in one of the mass categories, it was found that three-fourths of category volume growth in 2016 was contributed by only one manufacturer -- and it is unlisted,"" said a Nielsen spokeswoman, adding the top 30 FMCG manufacturers contributed around 55% to total FMCG last year. Nielsen didn't name the company as per its policy.Finance minister Arun Jaitley had announced several incentives on farm infrastructure and credit for rural and low-income consumers in the February budget, measures that could revive consumption.""There are clear signs of rural recovery, which had got derailed last year because of demonetisation,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Securities.""Measures to improve farm incomes and expectations of a normal monsoon are indications pointing towards better rural demand over the next few quarters. This is in contrast to last three years when there was a lull.""Companies such as HUL and Dabur are also stepping up direct reach with demonetisation turning out to be a silver lining as companies streamline cashless credit transactions and widen product portfolios, experts said."

For him, like other farmers of the village, the situation has changed and there is renewed hope of better farm incomes hereafter.The positive sentiment stems from the Rs. 2.2-crore lift irrigation project financed by the Karnataka Vikas Grameena Bank (KVGB), which was inaugurated by its chairman S. Ravindran last week. Under the scheme, nearly 109 acres will benefit from irrigation facility.Mr. Kattikar and his brothers were finding hard to sustain their agricultural activities. The 10 acres of dryland shared by the family had, in a way, become a liability. They had no option but to depend on rain, which often played truant with the village. Hereafter, they have assured irrigation.Mr. Ravindran asked the farmers to adopt integrated farming practices for the best results. They have now been provided with critical irrigation facilities from the Krishna river flowing 10 km from the village. The bank has also assured them of aid in any part of the district.Judicious and scientific utilisation of water, precise irrigation technology, and watershed development works to save sugarcane crop could provide the answer to recurring droughts, Mr. Ravindran said.The unique aspect of this lift irrigation scheme is that 56 farmers of the village came forward as a group to install an irrigation facility. The Mole branch of KVGB welcomed them and extended a loan of Rs. 1.8 crore. The remaining investment was shared by the stakeholders, KVGB public relations officer Ullas Gunaga said.Ghoraknath, a progressive farmer, said it was a first of its kind move in the district, facilitating land holding-wise irrigation for farmers. This eliminates possible disputes on sharing of water.Sidagonda Pujari, who owns 12 acres of land, said he was optimistic of what the future might hold for him and other farmers of the village.It is a first of its kind move in [Belagavi] district, facilitating land holding-wise irrigation.Ghokarnath,progressive farmer"
